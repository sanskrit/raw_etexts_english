This Volume deals with the period from the acces¬ 
sion of the Khaljis on the throne of Delhi to the 
First Battle of Panipat which laid the foundations of 
the Mughul Empire. The Muslim Sultans of Delhi 
never ruled over even a major part of India, except 
during two brief periods of about twenty years each. 
For the rest, the history of India was really the his¬ 
tory of a large number of independent States under 
both Hindu and Muslim rulers. There were three 
powerful Hindu kingdoms—Vijayanagara, Orissa 
and Mewar—which played a dominant role in 
politics throughout the period. There were also 
some minor Hindu kingdoms—Assam, Nepal* 
Mithila and Mar war—which maintained their inde¬ 
pendence. These Hindu States—particularly Mithila 
in the north and Vijayanagara in the south—per¬ 
formed the very important function of preserving 
the relics of Hindu culture against the onslaughts of 
powerful Islam. That India has not shared the fate 
of other countries in Asia overrun by Muslim forces 
is chiefly due to these States, and hence their history 
has been dealt with in some detail. Among the 
powerful Muslim kingdoms mention may be made 
of the Bahmani kingdom in the Deccan, and Gujarat, 
Malwa, Jaunpur and Bengal in North India. They 
vied with the Sultanate of Delhi—practically re¬ 
duced to the status of a kingdom—in patronizing 
art and literature, and the result was the evolution 
of a large number of local styles in architecture 
which form a distinctive feature of the period. These 
styles have been adequately dealt with. 

The period witnessed the settlement of Muslims 
on a large scale in India. Unlike the previous 
foreign invaders, the Muslims did not merge them¬ 
selves with the Hindus, and thus for the first time 
the population of India was divided into two sepa¬ 
rate units with marked distinctions. This was the 
historic beginning of the Hindu-Muslim problem 
which led after more than six hundred years to the 
creation of Pakistan. In this volume an attempt has 
been made, probably for the first time, to view the 
Hindu-Muslim relation in its true perspective. 

The period is also remarkable for the rise of a 
number of religious leaders like Ramananda, Kabir, 
Chaitanya and Nanak who ushered in a new phase 
of mystic devotionalism in Indian religion, the in¬ 
fluence of which may still be felt. This aspect of 
Indian culture has been dealt with more thoroughly 
than is to be found in any general history of India. 

Special chapters have been devoted to the Islamic 
political theory and administrative organization as 
well as the social condition of Indian Muslims. 

The contributors to this volume include, besides 
the Editor, Dr. S. Roy, Dr. Hameeduddin, Dr. A. K. 
Majumdar, Sri N. B. Ray, Dr. P. M. Joshi, Dr. N.

FOREWORD 


On account of heavy pressure of work, I have had to deny 
myself the usual privilege of writing a detailed foreword to this 
volume, presenting a view of this age in flowing time. 

In preparing this volume, Dr. R. C. Majumdar, General Editor, 
has had to bear more than his usual burden and I am deeply grateful 
to him for his indefatigable and conscientious labours, which were 
so ably supplemented by Dr. Ashok Majumdar, the Assistant Editor 
in charge of this volume. My thanks are also due to the scholars 
who have contributed the different sections of this volume, as also 
to the Director General of Archaeology who has supplied photo¬ 
graphs for the illustrations of this volume. 

I again express my gratitude to Shri G. D. Birla, Chairman, 
and members of the Board of Shri Krishnarpan Charity Trust, for 
their initial grant, without which the scheme could not have been 
undertaken, as also to the Government of India for their giving us 
a loan of Rs. 150,000/- for further financing this project. The staff 
of the Bhavan and its Press have looked after the preparation and 
printing of this volume with their usual care and deserve congra¬ 
tulations for their zeal.

PREFACE 

By Dr. R. C. Majumdar 
General Editor 

This volume deals with the period during which the foreign 
Muslim conquerors, mostly of Turkish origin, established an effec¬ 
tive suzerainty over the greater part of India. The popular notion 
that after the conquest of Muhammad Ghuri, India formed a Muslim 
Empire under various dynasties, is hardly borne out by facts. It has 
been shown in the preceding volume that the major part of India 
remained free from Muslim domination till almost the very end 
of the thirteenth century A.D. It was ‘Alla-ud-dm Khaljl who for 
the first time established Muslim suzerainty over nearly the whole of 
India. But his actual sovereignty did not extend beyond the Vin- 
dhyas, save in the Western Deccan during the last three years of his 
reign. The Khaljl empire rose and fell during the brief period of 
twenty years (A.D. 1300-1320). The Tughluqs, who succeeded the 
Khaljls, made an attempt not only to revive the empire but also to 
exercise an effective sovereignty over if. But the task proved beyond 
their power. The empire of Muhammad bin Tughluq, which included 
the southernmost part of India as a province under his governor, 
broke up within a decade of his accession (A.D. 1325), and before 
another decade was over, the Turkish empire passed away for ever. 
India once more presented the spectacle of being divided into a con¬ 
geries of States, both big and small, which always followed the dis¬ 
solution of an empire in the past. The state of things continued for 
nearly two centuries and a half till the Mughuls established a stable 
and durable empire in the second half of the sixteenth century A.D. 

Thus, barring the two very shortlived empires under the Khaljls 
and Muhammad bin Tughluq which lasted, respectively, for less than 
twenty and ten years, there was no Turkish Muslim empire of India. 
The Delhi Sultanate, as the symbol of this empire, continued in name 
throughout the period under review but, gradually shorn of power 
and prestige, it was reduced to a phantom by the invasion of Timur 
at the end of the fourteenth century A.D. Among the States that 
arose out of the ruins of these two ephemeral empires, six may be 
regarded as really very powerful. Three of these, namely the 
BahmanI kingdom in the Deccan, Gujarat in the west, and Bengal 
in the east were ruled by Muslims, while their rivals and neighbours, 
namely Vijayanagara in South India, Mewar in Rajputana, and 
Orissa, along the eastern coast, were ruled by Hindus. The rem- 


xxm 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


nant of the Delhi Sultanate and two other Muslim States, Jaunpur 
and Malwa, also occasionally played an important role. The con¬ 
stant rivalries and struggles between these States which were 
generally, but not invariably, grouped on religious lines, form the 
main feature of the political history of the period covered by this 
volume. A very prolonged and sustained warfare between Mewar 
and Gujarat cum Malwa in the west, BahmanI and Vijayanagara 
in the south, and between Orissa and the last two as well as Ben¬ 
gal in the east, indicates the main trend of politics during the period. 
These struggles weakened all these powers, but led to no decisive 
result. The intrigues and dissensions within the Delhi Sultanate, 
which had a brief revival of power under the Lodis, and its quarrels 
with the petty States in the north-west paved the way for the Mu- 
ghul conquest under Babur. 

The political disintegration and lack of a central authority were 
mainly responsible for two great calamities that befell India in the 
shape of foreign invasions, both big with future consequences. The 
first was the invasion of Timur, the Turkish autocrat, who followed 
in the footsteps of the Mongol Chingiz Khan and carried fire and 
sword over a large part of the continent of Asia. He had two objects 
in view in invading India,—first, to put Islam on a firm footing by 
'destroying the infidels (Kafir) and thereby becoming a Ghazi or a 
martyr’, and secondly, ‘to plunder the fabulous wealth and valuables 
of the infidels’. He was no doubt encouraged by the tottering con¬ 
dition of the Delhi Sultanate, and advanced with his hordes towards 
India. Urged forward by the hope of gaining reward both in this 
world as well as in the next—a combination of the two incentives 
most powerful in a medieval Muslim autocrat—Timur let loose the 
horrors of a barbaric warfare on the fair cities and plains of India. 
Never since the days of Sultan Mahmud, four hundred years before, 
had India witnessed such deliberate massacre of the Hindus in cold 
blood. Fortunately for historians, Timur has himself recorded his 
misdeeds, as it would otherwise be difficult to believe the inhuman 
atrocities perpetrated by him. Everything that unbridled lust and 
unchecked barbarism could conceive was perpetrated by his fanatic 
myrmidons, and the climax was reached in the cold-blooded massacre 
of one hundred thousand Hindu prisoners outside the plains of 
Delhi,—an event unparalleled in the history of the world. As 
attempts have been recently made to minimise and explain away 
his enormity, the account of his unmitigated barbarity has been 
given in some detail, as far as possible in his own words, in Chap¬ 
ter VII. 

A century later India was visited by the Portuguese fleet under 
Vasco da Gama. It was the first scene in the tragic drama which 


xxiv 



PREFACE 


ended with the complete subjugation of India by a European power. 
Vasco da Gama’s name occupies a high place in European history as 
the discoverer of the route or the means which enabled Europe to 
exploit fully the resources of the east. But the historians of India 
are bound to regard him, like Timur and other foreign conquerors 
beginning from Alexander, in quite a different light. For nearly 
two centuries he and his followers brought untold miseries upon the 
people living in the coastal regions, and ‘Portuguese’ became a by¬ 
word for cruelty in India. The historians have, however, generally 
failed to point out the strong family resemblance between Timur 
and Vasco da Gama. Both were inspired by the same motives— 
acquisition of wealth and promotion of religion, Islam in the one 
case and Christianity in the other. Both were equally cruel—al¬ 
most fiendish in character. The atrocity of Vasco da Gama, though 
necessarily limited by the means at his disposal, did not differ in kind; 
save that it had a refined touch of racial arrogance which made it all 
the more odious. As this aspect of Vasco da Gama is generally 
shrouded under his well-deserved reputation for exploring the sea- 
route to the east—as in the case of Alexander who similarly explored 
the land-route—this point has been fully dealt with in Chapter 
XIII-E.IV. It may be further added that Timur and Vasco da Gama 
were instrumental in establishing the supremacy, respectively, of the 
Mughuls and the British in India. The visitations of Timur and 
Vasco da Gama were thus no mere passing episodes in the history of 
the period, but pregnant with big consequences. They also demons¬ 
trated the serious defects in the defence system of India, caused by 
the manifold development in the technique of warfare, both by land 
and sea, in countries far beyond the frontiers of India within whose 
seemingly impregnable barriers her people chose to immure them¬ 
selves. But the lessons were lost upon men and rulers of India. 

There is, however, no cloud without a silver lining. The poli¬ 
tical disintegration, which led to so many evils, was also productive 
of some good results. It is a well-known fact that before the modern 
age art and literature could hardly flourish save under the patronage 
of courts. When there was only one important court, in Delhi, the 
development of art was limited both in character and extent, but 
the rise of independent States multiplied the number of courts and 
therewith the centres of patronage. The most important result was 
the development of provincial styles which increased both the variety 
and the productivity in art and architecture. The difference can best 
be understood by a comparison with the Mughul period which far 
excelled the period under review in political stability and its atten¬ 
dant magnificence and grandeur. But though art reached its high- 


xxv 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


water mark of excellence under the Mughul patronage, it suffered in 
variety and geographical extent in comparison with the preceding 
period. This difference is clearly brought out in the division of 
chapters in any book on Islamic Art in India. Percy Brown’s Indian 
Architecture (Islamic Period), for example, devotes four chapters 
only to the Imperial style under the four prominent dynasties of the 
Delhi Sultans, while the ten succeeding chapters deal with the pro¬ 
vincial styles of the Punjab, Bengal, Jaunpur, Gujarat, Malwa, Deccan 
and Kashmir (excluding Vijayanagara which is dealt with in the 
volume dealing with the Hindu period). Next follows the art of the 
Mughul period which is treated in only five chapters, under the 
names of the five great emperors (Babur-Humiayun being treated in 
one single chapter). This differenc is full of significance, and illus¬ 
trates the influence of court patronage upon the development of art 
and other aspects of culture. 

!f " * 

Although the political history of India during the fourteenth 
and fifteenth centuries is marked by the same lack of political cohe¬ 
sion that characterized the history of India since the downfall of the 
Gurjara-Pratlhara empire in the tenth century A.D., yet the histo¬ 
rical pictures of these two periods, as they have reached us, are not 
exactly the same. For, thanks to the Muslim historians, we get a 
very detailed account not only of the Delhi Sultanate, but also of 
many of the succession States that arose out of its ruins. Each of 
these States thus becomes a living reality, and political history is im¬ 
bued with a keen and vivid human interest such as is not aroused by 
anything that we know of the earlier period, save, of course, the 
history of the Mamluk Sultans of Delhi in the thirteenth century. 
The difficulties that henceforth confront the historians are caused 
not so much by the dearth of materials, as by their discrepancy and 
divergence. For the first time a historian of India is in a position to 
avail himself of materials which would not suffer in comparison with 
those on which the history of contemporary European and other 
Asiatic countries is based. 

A detailed account of these source materials on which the history 
of the period is based has been given in Chapter I. The contem¬ 
porary Muslim chronicles form the most important source of our in¬ 
formation and are very valuable in many respects, but they suffer 
from some serious drawbacks. They are court histories, pure and 
simple, and possess in a full measure both their merits and defects. 
They contain a great deal of precise information, and are more or 
less correct in respect of dates and details of military campaigns and 
other main incidents of the reign; but their authors could not always 
take an impartial and unprejudiced view, particularly when the 


xxvi 


PREFACE 


honour and prestige of the rulers were at stake. Thus, it is almost 
a common characteristic of these authors to omit, minimise, or ex¬ 
plain away the grave crimes of their patron kings and their families, 
and to give as favourable an account of their military campaigns as 
could be done without wholly violating truth, though cases are not 
rare where even this limit was not observed and defeats were either 
simply ignored or recorded as victories. The contemporary court 
histories concentrate their attention upon the Sultan and his doings, 
and seldom touch upon topics or events with which he was not 
directly or indirectly connected. But historical chronicles like those 
of Firishta and others, of a somewhat later date, supply this defi¬ 
ciency and give a regular account of various States, independently 
of the account of the Sultanate. As the authors of these chronicles 
lived long after, and were therefore under no obligation to most of 
the kings whose history they related, they could afford to take an 
unbiassed view; but being dependent for materials upon the contem¬ 
porary court-chronicles, they share some of the defects that charac¬ 
terized them. 

A serious drawback of all the historical writers of the period is 
that their vision seldom extended beyond the court, the capital, the 
rulers, and the aristocracy, and they hardly ever noticed the people 
at large or gave any information about their lives and activities, 
social manners and customs, economic condition, etc. This deficiency 
is partly made up by the writings of foreign visitors to India. Special 
reference should be made in this connection to the very interesting 
account of Ibn Batutah, who lived in India for thirteen years and tra¬ 
velled widely all over the country. His knowledge, erudition and 
wide experience, and the responsible posts he held in India invest 
his account of Indian life with a high degree of authenticity, and in 
the absence of more reliable evidence copious reference has been 
made to his writings in delineating contemporary social, economic 
and moral condition of the people. 

Fortunately, we possess fairly abundant knowledge of the reli¬ 
gious life of the period. It was the age of those mystic saints 
like Ramananda, Kabir, Chaitanya, and Nanak, whose noble lives and 
religious teachings, embodied in simple pious sayings, may be looked 
upon as the richest legacy of the period. These great religious 
teachers ushered in a catholic spirit in religion and elevated it to a 
high spiritual level, and by their precept and example shed a lustre 
on the age. Though their direct influence upon India as a whole may 
not have been very considerable, their teachings have permeated the 
very texture of Indian life.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


For this reason, the main stress has been laid upon these mystic 
saints in the chapter on religion. Though many joined the sects 
founded by, or formed subsequently in the names of, these saints and 
their followers, the number of such converts were very insigni¬ 
ficant in comparison with the total population of India. By far the 
large majority of the Hindus, and a still greater majority among the 
Muslims, continued to stick faithfully to the old orthodox religious 
beliefs and practices. The various sects of the Hindus, together with 
their rites and customs, described in the preceding volumes, still do¬ 
minated the Hindu society even though a considerable number of its 
members were influenced, more or less, by the doctrines preached 
by the great saints named above. The old doctrines, rites, and 
customs were stereotyped in Hindu society by the end of the thir¬ 
teenth century A.D. and still continued to dominate it. If they have 
not found a place in the chapter on religion, it is simply to avoid re¬ 
petition of what has been said in the preceding volumes, and the 
omission should not be interpreted as indicating their disappearance 
or diminution in importance. This fact must be remembered in 
forming a general idea of the religious condition of the country and 
making an estimate of the relative importance of the new creeds 
that form such a distinctive feature during the period under review. 

Partly as a result of the patronage of many of the saints, but 
mainly in consequence of the gradual process of evolution, the major 
spoken languages of India had a phenomenal development and pro¬ 
duced a rich literature. These languages and literature form an 
intimate link between modern India and the period covered in this 
volume, and have been dealt with in some detail in Chapter XV. 

The most outstanding fact in the social and religious life of the 
age is the impact of Islam. The followers of that faith settled in 
India in large numbers, but, generally speaking, kept themselves 
severely aloof from the normal current of the social and religious 
life of the country. Many times, since the advent of the Aryans, 
more than three thousand years ago, diverse types of culture met 
in India, but with the exception of a very small Parsi enclave, were 
all fused together in a common cultural pattern. The Muslims, how¬ 
ever, did not merge themselves into this pattern, and form with the 
Hindus a single type of homogeneous culture. So, for the first time 
in Indian history, two distinct but important communities and cul¬ 
tures stood face to face, and India was permanently divided into two 
powerful units, each with marked individuality of its own, which 
did not prove to be amenable to a fusion or even any close permanent 
co-ordination. The problem which then faced India has proved to 
be the most knotty one in its chequered history during the next six 

xxviii 


PREFACE 


hundred years, and has not entirely been solved by the partition or 
bifurcation of India. The genesis of the problem has therefore been 
dealt with in some detail in Chapter XVII-C. It is a delicate and 
difficult task, but could not be avoided in a history whose avowed 
object is to give a real picture of the history and culture of the Indian 
people. Islam touched Hindu life, and was itself touched by Hindu¬ 
ism, at many points. The reaction produced by the one upon the 
other is not always easy to determine, and the task has been rendered 
more difficult by passions and prejudices, and pressure of extraneous 
considerations. 

Political necessities of the Indians during the last phase of 
British rule underlined the importance of alliance between the two 
communities, and this was sought to be smoothly brought about by 
glossing over the differences and creating an imaginary history of 
the past in order to depict the relations between the two in a much 
more favourable light than it actually was. Eminent Hindu political 
leaders even went so far as to proclaim that the Hindus were not at 
all a subject race during the Muslim rule. These absurd notions, 
which would have been laughed at by Indian leaders at the begin¬ 
ning of the nineteenth century, passed current as history owing to 
the exigencies of the political complications at the end of that cen¬ 
tury. Unfortunately slogans and beliefs die hard, and even today, for 
more or less the same reasons as before, many Indians, specially Hin¬ 
dus, are peculiarly sensitive to any comments or observations even 
made in course of historical writings, touching upon the communal 
relations in any way. A fear of wounding the susceptibilities of the 
sister community haunts the minds of Hindu politicians and histo¬ 
rians, and not only prevents them from speaking out the truth, but 
also brings down their wrath upon those who have the courage to do 
so. But history is no respecter of persons or communities, and must 
always strive to tell the truth, so far as it can be deduced from 
reliable evidence. This great academic principle has a bearing upon 
actual life, for ignorance seldom proves to be a real bliss either to 
an individual or to a nation. In the particular case under conside¬ 
ration, ignorance of the actual relation between the Hindus and the 
Muslims throughout the course of history,—an ignorance deliberate¬ 
ly encouraged by some,—may ultimately be found to have been the 
most important single factor which led to the partition of India. The 
real and effective means of solving a problem is to know and under¬ 
stand the facts that gave rise to it, and not to ignore them by hiding 
the head, ostrich-like, into sands of fiction. 

It is thus quite clear that both from purely academic and practi¬ 
cal standpoints, the plain duty of a historian of India is to reveal 

xxix 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the truth about the communal relations in the past, without being 
influenced in any way by any extraneous factor. This conclusion is 
fortified by other considerations. It is now a well-known fact that a 
few powerful dictators who dominated Europe in the recent past em¬ 
phasized the need of re-writing the history of their countries to suit 
their political actions and ideals. This is undoubted^ a great tribute 
paid to history for its formative influence upon mankind, but cuts 
at the very root of all that makes history an intellectual discipline 
of the highest value. There are ominous signs that the same idea 
is slowly invading democratic countries also, not excluding India. 
This world tendency to make history the vehicle of certain definite 
political, social and economic ideas, which reign supreme in each 
country for the time being, is like a cloud, at present no bigger than 
a man’s hand, but which may soon grow in volume, and overcast 
the sky, covering the light of the world by an impenetrable gloom. 
The question is therefore of paramount importance, and it is the 
bounden duty of every historian to guard himself against the ten¬ 
dency, and fight it by the only weapon available to him, namely by 
holding fast to truth in all his writings irrespective of all conse¬ 
quences. A historian should not trim his sail according to the pre¬ 
vailing wind, but ever go straight, keeping in view the only goal of 
his voyage—the discovery of truth. 

These elaborate observations are specially intended to explain 
the editorial policy of the present series. The first five volumes, deal¬ 
ing with the history of the ancient Hindus, were, comparatively 
speaking, free from what would be regarded as serious controversial 
issues at the present day. The present volume, dealing with the 
beginnings of the Muslim settlement in India on a permanent basis, 
naturally has to deal with topics which have a direct or indirect 
bearing on many live issues of today. The number of such issues 
would go on increasing with each succeeding volume, and volumes 
IX and X, which deal with the British rule in India, will be full of 
them, evoking strong sympathies and antipathies which are likely 
to blur the clear vision of both writers and readers of Indian history. 
It would be the endeavour of the present editor to follow the three 
fundamental principles enunciated above: firstly, that history is no 
respecter of persons or communities; secondly, that its sole aim is 
to find out the truth by following the canons commonly accepted as 
sound by all historians; and thirdly, to express the truth, without 
fear, envy, malice, passion, or prejudice, and irrespective of all ex¬ 
traneous considerations, both political and humane. In judging any 
remark or opinion expressed in such a history, the question to be 
asked is not whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, mild or strong, im¬ 
politic or imprudent, but simply whether it is true or false, just or 


xxx 


PREFACE 


unjust, and above all, whether it is or is not supported by the evi¬ 
dence at our disposal. 

This editorial policy is responsible for clearly bringing out in 
detail those points of difference which stood as barriers between 
the Hindus and Muslims and served to keep them effectively as 
two separate units in their common motherland. These are pri¬ 
marily the religious bigotry on the side of the Muslims and social 
bigotry on the part of the Hindus. These differences are generally 
sought to be explained away or minimised, and even eminent scholars 
demur to pointed references to the oppressive acts of bigoted Mus¬ 
lim rulers like Firuz Tughluq and Sikandar Lodi even though proved 
by the unimpeachable testimony of their own confessions. Such an 
attitude may be due to praiseworthy motives, but is entirely out of 
place in historical writings. 

The same attitude is far more strikingly illustrated in another 
sphere. The end of Hindu ruling dynasties, followed by almost 
wholesale destruction of temples and monasteries by the Muslim 
invaders and rulers, very nearly extinguished the Hindu culture by 
destroying the sources which fed and nourished it. Its further 
growth was arrested and an almost impenetrable gloom settled over 
it. It seemed as if the whole course of its development came to a 
sudden halt. It is not a mere accident that the lamp of the past glory 
and culture of Brahmanical Hinduism was kept burning only in the 
Hindu principalities—particularly the tiny State of Mithila in the 
north and the kingdom of Vijayanagara in the south. Modern Hindu 
India is indebted to these Hindu kingdoms for having preserved the 
continuity of Brahmanical culture and traditions, from the Vedic age 
downwards, which was in imminent danger of being altogether 
snapped. For it is impossible to deny that India was saved from 
this irretrievable disaster by the patronage of the rulers of Vijaya¬ 
nagara and Mithila. While the Brahmanical culture was submerged 
under the sea of Islam from one end of India to the other, it found 
its last refuge in the two islands at the northern and southern extre¬ 
mities. This plain truth is not fully realized by many historians. 

The patronage of literature in spoken languages by a few Mus¬ 
lim rulers is the only redeeming feature in the general Muslim atti¬ 
tude to the Hindu culture. But its nature has been misunderstood 
and its effect much exaggerated. The Muslim hatred to the Brah¬ 
mans, to which Ihn Batutah bears eloquent testimony, made the Mus¬ 
lim rulers more favourablv inclined to such literature which was 

Kf 

looked upon by the Brahmans as a mortal blow to their power and 
prestige, and hence strongly disliked by them as a class. The period 
of Husain Shah and his son in Bengal is usually held out as one of 


XXXI 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the most glowing examples of the Muslim patronage of Hindu cul¬ 
ture. The high development of literature and philosophy of the 
Chaitanya school of Vaishnavism during the period under review is 
regarded as a sign of Hindu revival during the Medieval Age. It is, 
however, to be remembered that out of hundreds of Muslim rulers 
and officers in Bengal only three—Husain Shah, his son Nusrat Shah 
and his general Paragal Khan—are known to have patronized 
Bengali poets whose obsequious flattery to their Muslim patrons is 
disgusting to modern taste. As regards Chaitanya and his followers, 
their persecution in the hands of the officers of Husain Shah, the 
most enlightened and liberal Muslim Sultan, has been described 
in some detail on pp. 632-635. One significant feature of the 
Chaitanya movement is often ignored. Of the twenty-four years 
he remained in his mortal frame after he renounced the world 
and was initiated as a scinyasin, he hardly spent even a year in the 
dominion of Husain Shah and his Muslim successors, but lived for 
twenty years in the Hindu kingdom of Orissa. The Vaishnava fol¬ 
lowers of Chaitanya were persecuted in their homeland during the 
regime of Husain Shah, and Chaitanya spent practically his whole 
life as a sanydsin under the patronage of the Hindu ruler of Orissa 
who became his devoted disciple. By connecting these two facts it 
will not probably be wrong to surmise that though Chaitanya began 
his religious life in the Muslim kingdom of Bengal, it did not evi¬ 
dently prove a congenial home to him or to his cult, and both found 
a safe refuge only in the neighbouring Hindu kingdom. In any case 
the fact remains that the chief credit for the rise and growth of 
Chaitanya’s Vaishnavism must go to the Hindu kingdom of Orissa 
and not to the Muslim kingdom of Bengal. This is a very significant 
fact in the history of Hindu culture in India during the period under 
review. It may also be noted in this connection that Hindu art 
practically went out of existence in Muslim States, though in 
a few places like Gujarat, its influence may be traced in Muslim 
architecture. After the thirteenth century, notable specimens of 
Hindu art are to be found only in the Hindu States of Vijayanagara 
and Mewar. Hindu culture did not flourish under Islam, and the 
few facts brought forward to prove the contrary may at best be 
likened to a few tiny oases which merely serve to bring into greater 
relief the barren desolation of the long stretch of arid desert. 

In the face of all these difficult and delicate problems the task 
of maintaining the correct standard in a co-operative historical work, 
is not an easy one. As originally planned, the different chapters 
in this volume were to be written by different scholars who have 
specialised on the particular topics. But even the best efforts of 
the editor failed to secure a reasonable degree of objective and 


XXXI i 


PREFACE 


impartial treatment in certain chapters. The editor was there¬ 
upon obliged to take upon himself the responsibility of writing 
many more chapters than he originally intended. He spared no 
pains to equip himself for the task; how T far he has succeeded in 
doing justice to those chapters it is for the readers to judge. This 
is one of the reasons why the publication of this book has been 
long delayed. i\nother cause of the delay is the absence of the 
editor from India for nearly a year. 

Subject to what has been said above, the policy and principles 
of editing, referred to in the preceding volumes, remain unchanged. 
The transliteration of the names of Turkish rulers, and of other 
names and words of Persian and Arabic origin, which occur in large 
number in the present volume, generally follows the scheme adop¬ 
ted in the Cambridge History of India , Yols. Ill and IV. But there 
are discrepancies even in these two volumes. A few departures 
have therefore been made, and the editor takes this opportunity 
to express his gratitude to Dr. Sukumar Roy, Reader in the Cal¬ 
cutta University, for his ungrudging help in the matter. Dr. M. Isha- 
que, the author of Sections D and E of Chapter XV, desires to make 
it known that he was not in favour of this system in all points, 
but agreed to adopt it only for the sake of maintaining uniformity. 
Similarly Dr. S. K. Chatterjee, the author of Section B of the same 
Chapter, was in favour of adopting a strictly phonetic method in 
writing Indian words in different provincial dialects. But for rea¬ 
sons of practical convenience his scheme had to be considerably 
modified. 

The editor records with deep regret the death of Dr. A. S. 
Altekar, an eminent scholar who had contributed a chapter to 
Vol. IV of this series. His death has left a void in Indian scholar¬ 
ship which it would be difficult to fill up. Death has also carried 
away Prof. U. C. Bhattacharya, M.A., who contributed the sections 
on philosophy in the four preceding Volumes. The editor takes 
this opportunity to place on record his deep sorrow at the death 
of these two scholars and his appreciation of the great services ren¬ 
dered by them to the cause of Indian history and culture. 

Reference was made in the Preface of Vol. V to the retirement 
of Dr. A. D. Pusalker. His place as Assistant Editor was taken 
by Dr. A. K. Majumdar. He has worked hard and, it may be 
hoped, succeeded in maintaining the traditions and standard of this 
series. The thanks of the editor are due to him for his valuable 
services. The editor is glad to inform the readers of this series that 
Dr. Pusalker has recently rejoined his old post. Although his valued 
assistance was not available for this volume, as he has been suffering 


xxxni 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


from eye-troubles, the editor hopes that he will soon be in a position 
to actively resume his duty. 

In conclusion, the editor begs to convey his thanks to the contri¬ 
butors of this volume for their sincere co-operation, to the editors of 
various journals for their reviews of the preceding volume, to Messrs 
Macmillan and Co., Ltd., Calcutta, for kind permission to reproduce 
three poems from One Hundred Poems of Kabir, translated by 
Rabindranath Tagore, and to the Archaeological Department of the 
Government of India and various other institutions and individuals 
for lending photos and blocks for illustration. Reference has been 
made to them in detail under “acknowledgment”.

CHAPTER I 


THE SOURCES 

The Muslim Turks, who conquered India, brought with them 
the art of writing history, and have left a large number of chronicles 
which enable us to trace the history of India from the beginning of 
the Muslim conquest to the end of the Muslim rule. This is no 
mean advantage, particularly when we contrast it with the paucity 
of such historical narratives of the earlier period. Thanks to these 
historical chronicles, supplemented by quasi-hist or ical writings of 
contemporary literary men and accounts of foreign travellers, it is 
possible to write the political history of the period under review in 
a manner very different from that in which the preceding chapters 
have been written. The reader will feel this difference as he goes 
on with the history of this period. 

I. LITERARY SOURCES 

The first great name among the contemporary writers is that 
of Amir Khusrav, 1 whose full name is given by some authorities 
as Abu-’l Hasan Yamln-ud-dln Khusrav. He was born in A.D. 1253 
and enjoyed the favour and patronage of several Sultans of Delhi 
such as Kaiqubad, Jalal-ud-dm Khalji, ‘Ala-ud-dln Khalji, Qutb-ud- 
dln Mubarak Shah Khalji, and Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq. He was a 
prolific writer and is said to have composed about half a million 
verses. He began writing poems in his boyhood and continued his 
literary activity till his death in A.D. 1325. 

Though essentially a poet, and not a historian, Khusrav occa¬ 
sionally took historical themes as his subjects of composition, both 
in prose and poetry. His association with six successive Sultans 
and intimate intercourse with the aristocracy of blood, military oli¬ 
garchy, and the saint Nizam-ud-dm Aullya gave him the unique 
opportunity of knowing the truth about the political events and 
social condition of the time. Although, therefore, he never under¬ 
took to write any comprehensive historical chronicle, properly so 
called, his works, particularly his historical Masnavis and Divans, 
throw a great deal of light on contemporary history. Among these 
the following deserve special mention:— 

1. Qiran us Sa‘dain, composed in A.D. 1289, describes the 
historical meeting between Bughra Khan, the governor of 

1 


D S.—1 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Bengal, and his son Mu‘izz-ud-dln Kaiqubad, king of Delhi. 
It gives interesting details about India, particularly Delhi. 

2. Miftah-ul-Futuh, composed in A.D. 1291, describes the 
military campaigns of Jalal-ud-dln Khalji. 

3. ‘Aslruqa, completed in A.D. 1316, not only describes the 
passionate love between Dewal Rani (Devala Devi), 
daughter of Raja Karan (Karna) of Gujarat, and Prince 
Khizr Khan, but also gives an account of the poet’s cap¬ 
ture by the Mongols and his flight, and the beauties of 
Hindusthan and her women. 

4. Nuh Sipihr, completed in A.D. 1318, describes the military 
campaigns during the reign of Mubarak Shah. 2 

5. Tughluq-nama, composed in the closing year of the poet’s 
life, traces the course of events leading to the accession of 
Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq. 

6. In addition to the above poetical works, he also wrote in 
prose the Khazdin-ul Futuh or the Tdrikh-i-Aldi , which 
briefly describes the events of the first sixteen years of 
‘Ala-ud-dln’s reign, and, in particular, the campaigns of 
Malik Kafur in the Deccan which are not noticed in detail 
even by Ziya-ud-dln Barani. 

In addition to historical events Khusrav’s works throw much 
light on the social condition of the time and give a general picture 
of the country. But he writes more as a poet than as a professional 
historian. 

The first great historian of the period was Ziya-ud-dm Barani. 
In his famous work Tdrikh-i-Flruz Shahl , 3 composed about A.D. 
1358, he begins the history of India almost where the Tabaqdt-i-Ndsiri 
leaves it, and gives an account of the Sultans of Delhi from Balban 
to Muhammad bin Tughluq, together with the first six years of Flruz 
Shah’s reign. The reasons he gives for deliberately excluding from 
his purview the period covered by the Tabaqdt-i-Ndsiri are worth 
quoting in full, as they throw interesting light on the mentality of the 
historians of that age. “If I copy,” says he, “what this venerable 
and illustrious author has written, those who have read his history 
will derive no advantage from reading mine; and if I state any¬ 
thing contradictory of that master’s writings, or abridge or amplify 
his statements, it will be considered disrespectful and rash. In addi¬ 
tion to which I should raise doubts and difficulties in the minds of 
his readers.” 4 

In spite of this sentimental weakness, not befitting a true histo¬ 
rian, Barani had high conception of a historian and considered it 


THE SOURCES 


to be his essential duty to record honestly the whole truth. How 
far he conformed to this ideal is a matter of opinion. Elliot has 
described him as ‘an unfair narrator’ on the ground that he omitted 
altogether, or slurred over, as of no consequence, some of the most 
important events, for fear of incurring the displeasure of his patron. 6 
Even Firishta blames Barani for withholding the truth. This point 
is of some importance as it should induce us to attach greater im¬ 
portance to what he actually says in denunciation of a ruler. 

As Barani had easy access to the court, he had ample opportunity 
of knowing the accurate details. It is, therefore, somewhat sur¬ 
prising that he ‘is very sparing and inaccurate in his dates.’ It is 
also quite clear that he has not always arranged the events in a 
chronological order. “He is also wanting in method and arrange¬ 
ment.” 6 In spite of all these defects the Tdrlkh-i-Firuz Shahi of 
Barani still remains the most important source of the history of 
the period covered by it. 

A second work with the same title was written by Shams-i- 
Siraj ‘Afif, 7 who was born in A.D. 1342 and was a great favourite 
of Firuz Shah. It gives a full account of the long reign of this 
Sultan and throws much light on the culture of the period. It was 
composed shortly after the invasion of Timur, probably during the 
first decade of the fifteenth century A.D. The author wrote several 
other works, but they are all lost. 

Two other works concerning Firuz are of special importance. 
The first is the Futuhat-i-Firuz Shahi, 8 a small brochure of thirty- 
two pages composed by the Sultan himself. The title of the book 
literally means ‘victories of Firuz Shah’; and it contains a brief 
summary of the res gestae of his reign. In spite of the smallness 
of its size, its importance is very great, inasmuch as it gives us a 
reliable picture of the mentality of a bigoted Muslim king, and ac¬ 
quaints us with his own religious attitude in a way such as nothing 
else could. It also helps us to interpret correctly the actions of other 
Muslim Sultans of the same type. 

The second is an anonymous v/ork entitled Sirat-i-Firuz Shahi. 9 
It was written in A.D. 1370 during the reign of Firuz, and probably 
under his patronage and at his dictation. It is a bigger version of 
the other, and highly praises the activities of the monarch. 

Another historical work, written in the form of an epic, is the 
Futuli-us-Saldtin , 10 by Tsami about A.D. 1350. It gives an account of 
the long period from the rise of the Yaminis of Ghazni to the reign 
of Muhammad bin Tughluq. The author was a victim of the tyranny 
of Muhammad bin Tughluq, and was forced to leave Delhi for 
Daulatabad with his grandfather aged ninety, who died on the way. 


3 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


He settled at Daulatabad and composed his work under the patronage 
of Sultan ‘Ala-ud-dln Hasan Bahman Shah, the founder of the 
Bahmani dynasty. He was thus the only historian of the Tughluq 
period who was above fear or favour of the rulers of the dynasty. 
On the other hand, his personal sufferings at the hands of Muhammad 
bin Tughluq may account partly for his severe denunciations of the 
Sultan. 

Reference may be made to a fragment of four pages included 
in a manuscript of the Tabaqdt-i-NdsirT at the British Museum (Add. 
25,785). M. Habib, who first drew attention to it, regarded it as 
a part of an autobiography of Muhammad bin Tughluq, and M. 
Husain, who accepted this view, translated a portion of the manu¬ 
script and regarded it as of very great importance for a proper 
understanding of the psychology and character of Sultan Muhammad. 
Since then the authenticity of this work has been questioned by 
many. K. A. Nizami discussed the question at length and conclud¬ 
ed that the work was a fake. M. Habib also now concurs in this 
view. On the other hand, Qureshi regards the fragment as “part 
of a Persian version of the Sultan’s application to the Egyptian 
Caliph for recognition”. This view has also been endorsed by 
S. A. A. Rizvi. In any case, it is not safe to accept this fragment 
as a statement of the views of Muhammad bin Tughluq. 11 

For the invasion of Timur, which practically put an end to 
the rule of the Tughluqs, we have an authentic account in his auto¬ 
biographical memoir known as Malfuzat-i-Timurl. The original, 
written in Turki, was translated into Persian by Abu Talib Husaini 
and dedicated to the Emperor Shah Jahan. All doubts about its 
genuineness have now been removed and the work is universally re¬ 
garded as an authentic account of the acts and views of the great 
ruler. 12 

The exploits of Timur form the subject-matter of another work, 
Zafar-ndma, written only thirty years after his death by Sharaf- 
ud-dln ‘All Yazdi under the royal patronage of the grandson of the 
great conqueror. It is a reproduction of the other work in an ornate 
style. 13 

The only contemporary chronicle of the Sayyid period is the 
Tdrikh-i-Mubarak Shahl , 14 composed by Yahya bin Ahmad of Sir- 
hind shortly after the death of Mubarak Shah (A.D. 1421-34), the 
second king of the dynasty. Yahya was a Shiah, while nearly all 
the other historians of Delhi were Sunnis. He was a favourite of 
the king and had ample opportunity of knowing the events of his 
reign. Dowson regards him as “a careful and apparently an honest 
chronicler”. His work begins from the reign of Mu‘izz-ud-dln

THE SOURCES 


Muhammad Ghurl and ends with the accession of Sultan Muhammad, 
the third king of the Sayyid dynasty. The author himself says 
that “the facts (of his history) have been gathered from various his¬ 
tories and recorded up to the coronation of the powerful Firuz 
Shah. . . .and after that event whatever was witnessed (by the 
author) has been related.” 15 Thus Yahya relates, from his personal 
knowledge, the history of the period from the point where Barani 
ends, and “supplements the meagre information of ‘Afif from about 
A.D. 1380 onw&rds”. He is the most original authority for the period 
A.D. 1400 to 1434, and is the only authentic source of information 
about the Sayyid period. All the subsequent historians like Nizam- 
ud-din Ahmad, Badauni and Firishta have based their account of 
this period on this work. 16 

It is somewhat singular that no eminent historian flourished 
during the first period of Afghan rule under the Lodls. There is, 
however, a work of quasi-historical character by Shaikh Rizqullah, 
who had the poetical name Mushtaqi in Persian and Raj an in Hindi. 
Only two manuscripts of this work are known, and both are in 
the British Museum. One of these bears the title Wdqi‘at-i-MushtdqT, 
and the other Tarikh-i-Mushtaqi. The author was born in 897 A.H. 
(A.D. 1491-1492) and died in 989 A.H. (A.D. 1581-1582), the work 
being composed nine years before his death. It covers the whole 
period of Afghan rule, and undoubtedly contains many authentic 
details. But the author did not follow any regular plan of writing 
history, and his book is rather a series of disjointed narratives mixed 
with anecdotes. “These deficiencies, however, do not detract from 
the value of his work as a contemporary source, particularly on a 
part of the entirely untraversed period of the Lodls. It also re¬ 
mains the earliest extant account of the Surs which has been con¬ 
siderably borrowed by later writers. A short survey of administra¬ 
tive organisation, works of public utility, and measures to protect 
agriculture and ensure welfare of citizens, given by the author while 
dealing with the reigns of Sikandar Lodi, Sher Shah, and Islam 
Shah, along with brief but impartial descriptions of their private 
and court behaviour, is worthy of the closest attention, as it pre¬ 
serves therein means of judging the character and talents of these 
monarchs.” 17 

Our main sources of the history of the Lodi period are three 
historical works of the seventeenth century, which all begin from 
the reign of Buhlul Lodi. The first, the Tarikh-i-Shdhi or Tankh-i - 
Saldtln-i~Afghdna } composed by Ahmad Yadgar in A.D. 1601, ends 
with the death of Himu. The second, Makhzan-i-Afghana, com¬ 
posed by Nfimatullah in A.D. 1612, ends with the reign of Ibrahim

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Lodi. The third, Tdrikh-i-Ddudi, composed by ‘Abdullah during the 
reign of Jahangir (A.D. 1605-1627), ends with the death of Daud 
Shah (A.D. 1575). These three works thus deal exclusively with 
the Afghan rule in India. 

The history of the entire period covered in this volume is also 
dealt with in later historical works like those of Firishta, Nizam* 
ud-din, and Badauni to which reference will be made in the next 
volume. There are also contemporary and non-contemporary sources 
of minor importance to which detailed reference need not be made. 18 

Reference may be made to a few works written by foreigners. 
Badr-ud-dln, a native of Tashkent, who came to India and lived 
for some time in the court of Muhammad bin Tughluq, wrote a few 
Persian poems full of chronograms which are of great help in fixing 
the dates of many events. 19 

Shihab-ud-dln arUmarl (A.D. 1301-1348), a native of Damascus, 
wrote a book called Masdlik-ul-Ahsdr, which throws interesting side¬ 
light on the contemporary Muslim civilization in India. Though 
the author never came to India, he gathered his information from 
the travellers to India. 20 

The history of most of the provinces under independent Sultans 
was written by both Nizam-ud-dln and Firishta who consulted vari¬ 
ous authors, some of whose works are no longer available. How¬ 
ever, for some of the independent Sultanates provincial histories 
are also available. The earliest history of Sind for this period 
seems to have been the Tdrikh-i-Bahadur Shdlit, now lost, which 
was used by Nizam-ud-dm, and probably by Abu-’l Fazl and Firishta 
as well. The other histories of Sind were written at a later date. 
These are the Tdrikh-i-Sind of Mir Muhammad M‘asum written in 
A.D. 1600 for the instruction of the author’s son; the Tdrikh-i-Tdhin 
of Mir Tahir Muhammad Nisyam, written in A.D. 1654-55, which 
gives the history of the Arghuns in Sind; and the Tuhfat-ul-Kirdm 
by ‘All Sher Qani, written in the later half of the 18th century, of 
which the third volume is the most comprehensive and consistent 
of all the histories of Sind. 

For Kashmir, Mlrza Haidar Dughlat’s Tdrikh-i-Rasliidi, which 
gives an account of the Mlrza’s invasions and occupation of Kashmir, 
is the only Muslim source for the history of that period, and is a 
most useful supplement to the Rdjatarangim. The Tdrikh-i-Kdshmtr 
of Haidar Malik, a Kashmiri nobleman in the service of Yusuf Shah 
of Kashmir (A.D. 1578), gives the history of Kashmir from the 
earliest times. Though mainly based on the Rdjatarangim there are 
some additions in the later period. It was begun in A.D. 1618 and 
completed some time after A.D. 1620-21.

THE SOURCES 


For Bengal we have the Riydz-us-Salatin of Ghulam Husain 
Salim, which traces the history of the province from the invasion of 
Bakhtyar Khaljl to A.D. 1788, the date of the work. Of this work 
Sir Jadunath Sarkar writes: “...this book, named the Riy&z-us- 
Salatm, is meagre in facts, mostly incorrect in detail and dates, and 
vitiated by loose traditions, as its author had no knowledge of many 
of the standard Persian authorities who had treated of Bengal as 
a part of their general histories of India. ,,20a 

For the history of Gujarat there are several works such as the 
Mirat-i-Sikandafi of Sikandar bin Muhammad which gives the his¬ 
tory of Gujarat from the Muslim conquest to A.D. 1611, when the 
work was composed. Other Persian works are the Mirdt-i-Ahmadi 
by ‘All Muhammad Khan (c. A.D. 1756-1761) and the Tafikh-i - 
Gujarat by Mir Abu Turab Wall. There is also a valuable history 
of Gujarat written in Arabic, the Zafar-ul-Walih bi Muzaffar wa 
Alih of ‘Abdullah Muhammad bin ‘Umar al-Makkl. 

For the history of the BahmanI dynasty of Gulbarga and Bldar 
and of the Nizam Shah! dynasty of Ahmadnagar, we have the Bur- 
han-i-Ma‘dsir of Sayyid ‘All Tabataba. The author arrived in India in 
c. A. D. 1580 and entered first in the service of the Sultan of Golcon- 
da, and then that of Burhan Nizam Shah II, from whom the history 
derives its title. The author states in the preface that he commenced 
the work in 1000 A.H. (A.D. 1591-1592)—the title itself being a 
chronogram giving this date—and it is brought down to 1004 A.H. 
(A.D. 1595-96). The author seems to have borrowed freely from the 
Futuh-us-Sald,tin of TsamI in describing the reign of ‘Ala-ud-dln 
Hasan, the first BahmanI Sultan. The Tazkirat-ul-Muluk by Rafi- 
ud-dln Shiraz! is a history of the ‘Adil Shahls of Bijapur and of con¬ 
temporary Indian and Persian dynasties. In the introductory 
chapter there is a brief account of the BahmanI Dynasty which cor¬ 
roborates and supplements the Burhdn-i-Ma c dsir on some points. 
The work was begun in A.D. 1608-9 and completed in 1611-12. The 
author was in the service of ‘All ‘Adil Shah II (A.D. 1557-1579), and 
held the office of the Governor of Bijapur. 

In addition to the Muslim chronicles there are three Sanskrit 
poetical works dealing with the history of Kashmir, a short account 
of which has been given above. 21 They continue the historical 
narrative of Kalhana from the middle of the twelfth century down 
to the conquest of Kashmir by the Mughul emperor Akbar. Al¬ 
though inferior to Kalhana’s Rdjatarangini in literary style, these 
works, particularly the earliest one written by Jonaraja, are of great 
importance, and help us both in correcting and supplementing the 


7 



THE DELHI SULTANATE 


statements in Muslim chronicles regarding Kashmir. 22 It may be 
added that these three works have been treated by Muslim historians 
as the basis of their works. 

The bardic chronicles of Rajasthan, written in the form of 
ballads, supply valuable information, though they contain much 
that is merely poetical effusion. 

We possess voluminous literary evidence for the history of 
Vijayanagara, to which reference will be made later. 

A beautiful Sanskrit poem Madhuravijayam (conquest of 
Madura) describes the campaigns of Kumara Kampana, son of 
Bukka I, the king of Vijayanagara, against the Muslim Sultan of 
Madura. The poem was written by Kampana’s wife Gahgadevi and, 
though written in epic style, contains useful historical information. 
Another historical work relating to Vijayanagara is the Achyuta- 
rdydhhyudaya by Rajanatha. It describes the events in the reign of 
Achyuta Raya, the half-brother and successor of Krishnadeva Raya. 

II. ACCOUNT OF FOREIGN TRAVELLERS 

In addition to the historical chronicles, we have a very valuable 
source of information in the accounts left by foreign travellers who 
visited India during this period. The most important of them was 
Ibn Batutah, who wrote a detailed account of his travels ( Rehla ). 23 
Batutah was his family name, his personal name being Abu 
‘Abdullah Muhammad. He was born at Tangier in A.D. 1304 and 
is said to have died at Fez at the age of seventy-four. In A. D. 1325 
he left his home and, passing through various countries in Africa 
and West Asia, crossed the Sindhu in A.D. 1333. It is unneces¬ 
sary for our present purpose to give a detailed account of his travels 
which took him as far as Indonesia and China. Suffice it to say 
that out of a total of more than 77,000 miles, he covered more than 
14,000 miles in the course of his travels through India, Maldives 
and Ceylon. He stayed in India for about fourteen years (A.D. 1333- 
47) of which about eight years were spent at Delhi (A. D. 1334-42) 
where he was appointed qdzl by Muhammad bin Tughluq, and 
assigned the office of hospice administrator (A.D. 1334). He enjoyed 
high favours of the emperor at first, but later incurred his displea¬ 
sure and was kept under watch for some time. 24 He was, however, 
restored to royal favour and was offered service, but he declined. 
He was then asked to conduct a royal embassy to China, and he 
agreed to do so (A.D. 1341). But it was not till A.D. 1346 that after 
visiting a number of places he left Bengal on a ship and sailed to 
China via Sumatra and Java.

THE SOURCES 


The Rehla (Travels ) of Ibn Batutah contains abundant infor¬ 
mation not only on the momentous events of the period, but also 
on the judicial, political and military institutions, and social and 
economic conditions of India. It also throws interesting light on a 
variety of topics such as the postal system and roads, traffic and 
secret intelligence, men and ideas of the age, agricultural products, 
court ceremonies, trade and shipping, music, etc. 

As a contemporary account of a widely travelled and experi¬ 
enced man of wisdom who had ample opportunity of knowing the 
truth, the Rehla of Ibn Batutah occupies a very important place 
among the sources of information for the reign of Muhammad bin 
Tughluq. His account is invaluable as it enables us to form a fair 
estimate of the character and achievements of this emperor, who 
was one of the most enigmatic personalities that ever ruled over 
a vast kingdom. There is no reason to doubt the general veracity 
of his accounts, and being a foreigner, he was free from the diffi¬ 
culties and embarrassments of a court-chronicler and personal predi¬ 
lections of an Indian historian for the contemporary ruler or his 
family. 

We get a brief account of India in the fourteenth century in 
the Subh-ul-A‘shd of al-Qalqashandi. He had, however, never 
visited India, but based his work on those of former travellers and 
geographers. ‘Abd-ur-Razzaq, the Persian Ambassador to the court 
of the Zamorin of Calicut (A.D. 1442), visited Vijayanagara and 
wrote a detailed account of the society and administration of the 
kingdom. 

We also possess the accounts of some European travellers who 
visited India during the period under review. The Franciscan friar, 
John of Monte Corvine, and Marco Polo visited India, respectively 
on their way to and back from China, during the last decade of the 
thirteenth century. Friar Odoric of Pordenone arrived in India 
about A.D. 1321, and Friar Jordanus, probably a little before him. 
They were followed shortly afterwards by the Florentine monk 
John of Marignolli. But the most important, from our point of view, 
was Nicolo Conti, an Italian, who visited Vijayanagara about A.D. 
1420. He gave a detailed account of this kingdom to a Papal Secre¬ 
tary who wrote it in Latin. Although this original version is lost, 
we have got its translation in Portuguese, and an Italian version of 
the latter. 

Reference may also be made to the famous Portuguese chronicle, 
The Commentaries of the Great Alfonso D’Alboquerque, which was 
compiled by Albuquerque’s natural son, Braz d’Albuquerque, from 
the original letters and despatches sent by his father to King Manoel 


9 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


of Portugal, some of which throw light on the relation between the 
Portuguese and the Sultan of Gujarat. 

Among other European writers may be mentioned Athanasius 
Nikitin, a Russian trader, who visited the RahmanI kingdom (c. A.D. 
1470), Ludovico di Varthema of Bologna in Italy (A.D. 1502-6), and 
the Portuguese Duarte Barbosa (A.D. 1500-1516) and Domingos 
Paes (c. A.D. 1500-2). 25 

III. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOURCES 

The epigraphic and numismatic sources, though not as im¬ 
portant and valuable as for the pre-Muslim period of Indian History, 
are still of great help in fixing the chronology of events, correcting 
the list of rulers and their dates as given in the chronicles, and 
determining the approximate limits of a kingdom. In particular, the 
inscriptions of the Hindu rulers of Orissa, the Deccan, and South 
India contain much valuable information that throws an altogether 
new light on the history of these regions. They demonstrate that 
the Muslim chronicles, mentioned above, were written mostly from 
the point of view of Muslim rulers, and generally ignored the poli¬ 
tical activities of the Hindus, who lived outside their dominions. 

The epigraphs have been published mostly in Epigraphia Indo - 
Moslemica, Epigraphia Carnatica, Epigraphia lndica, and other anti¬ 
quarian journals. 26 

The Chronicles of the Pathan Kings of Delhi by Edward Thomas 
deals comprehensively with the coins of the period, and is regard¬ 
ed as a standard work on the subject. This has been supplemented 
by the catalogues of coins in different Museums to which full re¬ 
ference will be made in the Bibliography. The following observa¬ 
tions by Lane Poole may be regarded as a correct estimate of the 
importance of coins as a source of the history of this period: “As a 
rule we may look upon Muhammadan coins as the surest founda¬ 
tions for an exact history of the dynasties by which they were issued. 
The coins of a Muslim ruler generally go far to establish those out¬ 
ward data in regard to his reign which oriental historians too often 
neglect or mis-state. The year of accession, the extent of his domi¬ 
nion, his relations with the neighbouring powers and with the 
spiritual chief of his religion are all facts for which we may look 
with confidence to his coins.” 27 The pagodas of Vijayanagara kings 
and the coins of the Sultans of Madura and Bahmanl kingdom are 
also found in large quantities. While the last two follow the models 
of the Delhi Sultanate, the legends of the first were at first written 
in either Kannada or Nagarl and, later, exclusively in Nagari script.

CHAPTER II 


THE KHALJI DYNASTY 

I. JALAL-UD-DIN FIRUZ SHAH (A.D. 1290-96) 

The accession of Malik Firuz on the throne of Delhi in June 
1290 1 as Jalal-ud-dln Firuz Shah caused so much resentment among 
the people of Delhi, that for about a year he thought it prudent 
to remain at Kilughari. The people had become accustomed to the 
rule of the Ilbarl Turks for about eighty years and saw in Firuz Shah 
an Afghan usurper who had put an end to the Turkish rule. In 
reality, the Khalj Is were not Afghans as they were erroneously be¬ 
lieved to be, but Turks who had been settled for a long time in 
the region of Afghanistan called Khalj, Ijdng on either side of the 
Helmand, and had adopted Afghan manners and customs. They had 
migrated to Hindusthan in the wake of the Ghaznavid and the 
Ghurid invasions as well as the Mongol pressure in Central Asia 
and Afghanistan. Jalal-ud-dln Firuz made Kilughari his capital, 
completed the unfinished palace and gardens of Kaiqubad, and in¬ 
structed his courtiers and followers to build their houses around the 
palace. Thus Kilughari soon became a beautiful suburb of Delhi 
humming with life. 

The Khalji revolution put an end to the supremacy of the 
Ilbarl Turks. Firuz, of course, did not exclude them from office, 
but he appointed his own relations to positions of trust. Malik 
Chhajju, nephew of Balban and the only survivor of the late royal 
family, was allowed to retain the fief of Kara-Manikpur. The office 
of chief minister ( wazir ) was conferred on Khvaja Khatir, who had 
held it under Balban and Kaiqubad. Fakhr-ud-din, the koiwal of 
Delhi, continued to hold his position. The king’s eldest son obtain¬ 
ed the title of Khan Khanan; the second, Arkali Khan, and the third, 
Qadr Khan. His younger brother was ennobled as Yaghrush Khan 
and appointed army minister ariz-i-rnumcilik). His nephews, 
‘Ala-ud-dln and Almas Beg, obtained important posts in the royal 
household, while his relation, the witty but bluntly frank Malik 
Ahmad Chap, was appointed deputy master of the ceremonies. 

Never was a ruler a greater misfit in his time than the first 
Khalji king of Delhi. A pious and God-fearing Muslim, Firuz was 
an old man of seventy when he came to the throne. His innate 
good nature, combined with weakness born of old age, made him 
unduly kind and generous, and deprived him of those manly quali- 


12 


THE KHALJ! DYNASTY 


ties which are necessary for kingship. 2 The valiant governor of 
Samana, who had ably repelled the series of Mongol invasions, was 
very different from the Khalji king who would raise the siege of 
Ranthambhor, considering ten such forts not worth a single hair of 
a Muslim. One could appreciate the man in Firuz, when he dis¬ 
mounted from his horse and stood with tears in his eyes before 
the Red Palace of Balban as the melancholy thought arose in his 
mind how often he had stood in awe before the same throne, but 
his Khalji followers could see in it nothing but sentimental rubbish 
attempting to cover his infirmity. 

Malik Chhajju was the first to take advantage of Firuz Shah’s 
reckless leniency, for as a Balbanite he could press his claim to 
the throne of Delhi and count on the support of its populace. Joined 
by Amir ‘Ali, the sar-jdnddr, governor of Awadh and other old 
adherents of Balban, Malik Chhajju, just a few months after the 
accession of Firuz, set up independent authority at Kara and march¬ 
ed towards Delhi with a large force. He was, however, defeated 
near Badaun and took to flight. Being hotly pursued, he was cap¬ 
tured along with his lieutenants, and was brought before the King 
at Badaun in fetters. Firuz not only released them, but entertained 
them and even expressed his appreciation of their loyalty to their 
former sovereign. To Malik Ahmad Chap’s grave warning that 
such conduct on the part of a sovereign was unseemly and injudi¬ 
cious, tending to encourage rebellion, the old King replied that he 
would rather renounce the throne than shed the blood of Muslims. 
Malik Chhajju’s fief of Kara was given to the King’s nephew and 
son-in-law, ‘Ala-ud-din, for his gallant participation in the campaign, 

Firuz Shah’s lenient and mild policy fostered disloyal ambition 
among the nobles who interpreted it as the result of his weakness. 
They were confirmed in their opinion by the King’s treatment of 
the thags, who were a perpetual menace in the environs of Delhi. 
A thousand of these professed robbers and murderers were captur¬ 
ed, but the King merely sent them to Bengal where they had full 
freedom to carry on their criminal activities. In a drinking party 
some of the nobles even made the proposal of killing Firuz and 
offering the throne to Taj-ud-din Kuchi, who was a prominent 
nobleman and a member of the famous ‘Forty’. When Firuz re¬ 
ceived this report, he sent for the conspirators and challenged them 
in an open duel, but his indignation was easily calmed down by 
the flattering words of one of them. Firuz pardoned them all, though 
they were dismissed from the court for a year with warning. 

The proverbial leniency of Firuz, however, failed on one occa¬ 
sion. Sidi Maula, a saint who had migrated from Persia, was a 


13 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


disciple of Shaikh Farid-ud-din Ganj-i-Shakar of Ajudhan and 
had settled at Delhi early in the reign of Balkan. From the conflict¬ 
ing accounts in the chronicles, it is difficult to say whether he was 
really a saint or a charlatan. He offered prayers but never visited 
a mosque. He practised strict austerity, employed no maid or slave 
in his household, and accepted no offering, but maintained a hospice 
where a large number of people were sumptuously fed every day. 
Some believed that he possessed the knowledge of alchemy and 
magic, while some suspected that he was a pensioner of the thags, 
but most probably he was financed by Khan Khanan, the King’s 
eldest son. In spite of the warning of his preceptor, Sidi Maula 
associated himself with politics and soon became the favourite of 
Khan Khanan, and in consequence the enemy of Arkali Khan, the 
second son of Firuz. Indeed, his hospice became the rendezvous of 
the malcontents among the old Turkish nobility who could not re¬ 
concile themselves to the Khalji regime. Sidi Maula became a power 
and could count on some 10,000 men as his followers and no wonder 
that his hospice with its regular nocturnal gatherings soon became 
the centre of political intrigue. There was a conspiracy to assassi¬ 
nate Firuz on the occasion of Friday prayer, proclaim Sidi Maula as 
the Caliph, and marry him to a daughter of Kasir-ud-din Mahmud. 
The plot, however, leaked out on account of the betrayal of one 
of the members, and the conspirators were arrested in time. They 
did not confess the guilt; custom did not sanction torture, and the 
juries would not sanction ordeal by fire. The King transferred Jala! 
Kashani, one of the ring-leaders, to Badaun, punished some and 
exiled others, and asked his courtiers to avenge him on Sidi 
Maula. As soon as the saint was brought captive to the royal pre¬ 
sence, he v/as slashed with a razor and stabbed with a packing 
needle by a man belonging to a hostile sect, and then trampled to 
death under the feet of an elephant by order of Arkali Khan (1291). 
Sidi Mania’s death, according to Barani, was followed immediately 
by a dust storm that darkened the day and shortly afterwards 
drought and famine took a heavy toll of human lives. All this was 
interpreted by the historian Barani and the pious orthodox section 
as expressions of heaven’s wrath for murder of the saint. The Sidi 
Maula affair may be regarded as the last attempt of the Ilbarl party 
to recover its lost ground. It was not possibly altogether accidental 
that Khan Khanan, who was the chief disciple of Sidi Maula, 
died soon after, and Arkali Khan became heir apparent. 

Shortly after, Firuz led an expedition to Ranthambhor, leaving 
Arkali Khan as regent at the capital. On the way the troops cap¬ 
tured Jhain, and the King, though he appreciated the art and archi- 


14 


THE KHALJI DYNASTY 


lecture of its temples, did not fail to show his iconoclastic zeal by 
ordering their destruction and despatching the fragments of their 
idols to Delhi, to be thrown near the gates of the Jami‘ mosque to 
be trodden upon by all. The Rana of Ranthambhor shut himself up 
in the fort, and Firuz decided not to besiege it. When Ahmad Chap 
protested against it, he remarked that he did not consider ten such 
forts worth a single hair of a Muslim, and returned to Delhi on 
June 3, 1291. 

In A.D. 1292, a vast horde of Mongols, estimated to be between 
100,000 and 150,000, invaded India under the command of a grand' 
son of Iiulagu and penetrated as far as Sunam. Firuz, who had long 
served as the warden of the marches, met the Mongol advance guard 
and defeated it, but afraid to face the main force of the invaders, 
made peace with them. Ulghu, a descendant of Chingiz Khan, 
accepted Islam with 4,000 followers. They were settled in the sub¬ 
urbs of Delhi and came to be known as the ‘New Muslims’. Towards 
the end of the year, Firuz took Mandor 3 and made a second raid 
into Jhain. 

Meanwhile the centre of political gravity was shifting from 
the old King to his ambitious nephew, ‘Ala-ud-dm, the gov¬ 
ernor of Kara, whose personal ambition was incited by the dis¬ 
affected nobles who were behind Malik Chhajju. They suggested 
to him the possibility of a successful coup with proper finance, the 
lack of which was the cause of Chhajju’s failure. ‘Ala-ud-din’s un¬ 
happy relations with his wife, the daughter of Firuz, also prompted 
him to undertake a profitable, though perilous, undertaking with a 
view to taming her who was a veritable shrew. Towards the end 
of 1292, ‘Aia-ud-dm obtained permission of the King, who had just 
captured Mandor, for a raid into Bhilsa. After a surprise attack 
on it, ‘Ala-ud-din returned to Delhi with an enormous booty among 
which were some metal idols which were laid down before the 
Badaun gate to be trampled by the faithful. He was rewarded by 
the King with the addition of Awadh to his governorship of Kara. 
Emboldened by royal favour and the steadily waning reputation of 
Firuz, he sought and obtained the King’s permission for a raid into 
Chanderi and remission of the revenues of Kara and Awadh to en¬ 
able him to raise a fresh army for the purpose. ‘Ala-ud-din set 
out on February 26, 1296, 4 with an army of 3,000 or 4,000 horse 
and 2,000 infantry, ostensibly for Chanderi but in reality for Deva- 
giri (Deoglr, modern Daulatabad), about whose fabulous wealth he 
had heard during his Bhilsa campaign. Malik ‘Ala-ul-Mulk, uncle 
of the historian Barani, was left at Kara as his deputy with instruc- 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


tion to send false reports to Delhi with a view to allaying the 
King’s suspicion about his movements. Passing through Chanderi 
and Bhiisa, he marched straight to Ellichpur, the northernmost out¬ 
post of the Yadava kingdom of Devagiri, where he halted for two 
days and posed himself as a disaffected nobleman of the Delhi 
court seeking service under the Raja of Rajahmundry. At the pass 
of Lasura, some twelve miles west of Devagiri, Ala-ud-din met 
with stubborn resistance from Kanha, governor of the place, who 
was greatly helped by two women, possibly rulers of principalities 
under him. Defeating them, Ala-ud-din appeared before Devagiri 
at an opportune moment, when, as he had already been informed 
by his scouts, the Yadava ruler Ramachandra (or Ramadeva) had 
sent away the main army to the frontier under his son, whose name 
is usually taken to be Sankara but seems to be really Sihghana. 5 
Ramachandra was, therefore, forced to take shelter within the fort. 
Ala-ud-din thoroughly plundered the city and gave out that his 
army was but the advance guard of the main force of 20,000 horse 
that was following. The Yadava king, suffering from lack of pro¬ 
visions and apprehending the enemy’s strength, sued for peace at the 
end of a week. As Ala-ud-din was in a hurry to return from the un¬ 
authorised campaign, he accepted Ramachandra’s proposals and con¬ 
cluded a treaty. Meanwhile Sihghana, on learning of the Muslim 
invasion, had hastened towards the capital with a large army 5a and, 
ignoring his father’s remonstrance not to violate the treaty, attacked 
Ala-ud-din. The Muslim troops were seized with panic and would 
possibly have lost the battle but for the timely arrival of the con¬ 
tingent of Nusrat Khan which Ala-ud-din had left in charge of the 
investment of the fort immediately after the renewal of hostilities. 
This turned the tide, as it was mistaken by the Devagiri troops for 
the alleged 20,000 horse that was following, and they retreated in 
confusion. Ala-ud-din now pressed the siege and Ramachandra was 
forced, due to the shortage of provisions, to sue for peace again. The 
Khalji adventurer now dictated harder terms. Besides the booty in 
horses and elephants, he obtained huge indemnity, promise of the 
annual revenue of Ellichpur and the hand of a daughter of Rama¬ 
chandra. Twenty-five days after his arrival at Devagiri, he left it, 
and with great speed returned to Kara on June 3, 1296, storming the 
fort of Asirgarh on the way. 

Ala-ud-din’s brilliant campaign in the Deccan, which was to 
him a terra incognita and several hundred miles away from his base, 
was an extraordinary exploit. It marked the first step in Islam’s 
march into the South, and made him, the governor of Kara, the king 
of Delhi. Delhi was really conquered at Devagiri, for it was the 


10 


THE KHALJI DYNASTY 


gold of the Deccan that paved the way for ‘Ala-ud-din’s accession to 
the throne. 

During his absence ‘Ala-ud-din’s deputy at Kara had explained 
his silence to the Sultan as due to his constant exertions in subduing 
refractory kingdoms; and Firuz, who had great affection for his 
nephew, was easily convinced in spite of the warning of some of the 
nobles. Early in 1296 the King marched with his army to Gwalior 
and it was there that he first learnt of his nephew’s secret venture 
into the Deccan and of his return with immense wealth. Firuz not 
only turned a deaf ear to the warning of Ahmad Chap, but admonish¬ 
ed him for his advice to intercept ‘Ala-ud-dln at Chanderi. The 
King returned to Delhi and, shortly after, received a letter from his 
nephew at Kara, begging his pardon for undertaking an expedition 
without his leave and promising to return all the treasures he had 
obtained. ‘Ala-ud-dm followed this by sending another letter to his 
brother Almas Beg to the effect that he was repentant for his mis¬ 
conduct and was so panic-stricken that he would either leave for 
Bengal or commit suicide, and would not feel convinced of royal 
pardon unless the King would personally come to Kara and take him 
to Delhi. Almas Beg showed his brother’s letter to Firuz who, 
moved by affection and lure of the Deccan gold, soon left for Kara by 
river with his trusted nobles; while the army, one thousand horse, 
proceeded by land. ‘Ala-ud-dln, as he received the report of the 
King’s departure from Delhi crossed the Ganga (Ganges) and moved 
to Manikpur with his army and treasures. When the boats of the 
King reached Kara, Almas Beg, who had arrived before, received 
him and persuaded him to meet his nephew alone, as any armed 
escort would frighten ‘Ala-ud-dln, while to the suspicious nobles of 
the King he explained the presence of ‘Ala-ud-dln’s army in battle 
array as but the befitting arrangement to accord his uncle a royal 
reception in which the treasures would be delivered. So, accom- 
pained by a small number of unarmed nobles, Firuz proceeded to 
the other bank ‘as a father goes to his son’s house’. ‘Alla-ud-din 
received his uncle as he landed at Manikpur and fell at his feet. The 
King raised him up, assured him of his never-failing affection and, 
lovingly taking his hand, led him towards his barge, when Muham¬ 
mad Salim at the preconcerted signal attacked Firuz with his sword. 
Wounded, the old King ran towards the river crying: ‘Ah, you 
wretch, ‘Ala-ud-din! What have you done?’, when another assassin 
Ikhtyar-ud-din Hud, who had pursued him, threw him down and, 
cutting off his head, presented it to ‘Ala-ud-dln (July 20, 1296). The 
King’s attendants were all put to death; but Ahmad Chap was able 
by difficult marches through rain to lead the army back to Delhi.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


II. ‘ALA-UD-DIN KHALJI (A.D. 1296-1316) 

1. Consolidation of Power 

The severed head of Jalal-ud-dln Flruz Shah was yet dripping 
with blood, when the royal canopy was raised over the head of 
‘Ala-ud-dln, and he was proclaimed king. The head of the murder¬ 
ed Sultan was placed on a spear and paraded through Kara and 
Manikpur and then through Awadh. The new king rewarded his 
followers with titles and promotions. Almas Beg obtained the title 
of Ulugh Khan; Hizabr-ud-dm, Zafar Khan; Malik San jar, Alp 
Khan; and Malik Nusrat, Nusrat Khan; while others were promoted 
to higher ranks. But Delhi was still in the hands of Flruz Shah’s 
men and l Ala-ud-dm hesitated to march on the capital during the 
rains against Arkall Khan who was an able general. The rashness 
of Flruz Shah’s widow, however, favoured his cause. She hastened 
to proclaim her youngest son Qadr Khan as king under the title 
Rukn-ud-dln Ibrahim, setting aside the claim of the elder son Arkall 
Khan who was at Multan. Consequently Arkall Khan became com¬ 
pletely alienated from his mother, and his partisans refused to 
recognize her nominee. These divisions in Flruz Shah’s family 
offered ‘Al'a-ud-din the opportunity to march on Delhi, and he 
advanced ‘with iron in one hand and gold in the other’. The gold of 
Devagiri, which he now lavishly distributed, enabled him to gather 
a large army exceeding 60,000 horse and 60,000 foot. During the 
height of the rainy season ‘Ala-ud-dln marched by way of Badaun 
and Baran, where he was joined by some of the prominent Jalali 
nobles who had been sent by the queen-mother to oppose him. The 
infection spread to Delhi as well, where many of the nobility aban¬ 
doned the cause of Rukn-ud-din in favour of his powerful cousin. 
As ‘Ala-ud-dln approached Delhi, the boy king came out to offer 
resistance; but as the entire left wing of his army deserted to the 
enemy, he with his mother, led by the loyal Ahmad Chap, left for 
Multan. ‘Ala-ud-dln then made his triumphal entry into the capital 
on October 22, 1296, 6 and took up his residence in the Red Palace 
of Balban, where he was formally enthroned. By lavish distribu¬ 
tion of wealth he gained, rather purchased, the loyalty of all sec¬ 
tions of people. 

‘Ala-ud-dln lost no time in sending Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan 
to Multan against his cousins, the sons of the late king. At the head 
of a force between 30,000 and 40,000 they besieged Multan and 
compelled Arkall Khan and Rukn-ud-dln Ibrahim to surrender. They 
were taken captive, and near Hansi they, with their brother-in-law 
Ulghu Khan and Ahmad Chap, were blinded by the express order 

18 


THE KHAUI DYNASTY 


of ‘Ala-ud-din. Later on, the two brothers were put to death, while 
their mother was kept under close custody at Delhi. 

Nusrat Khan was now appointed minister ( wazir ), but as he 
became unpopular he was transferred to Kara, while his lieutenant 
at Kara, ‘Ala-ul-mulk, was appointed to the position of kotwal of 
Delhi. Shortly after ‘Ala-ud-din’s accession, a horde of 100,000 
Mongols led by Kadar invaded the Punjab and advanced as far as 
the environs of Lahore. Ulugh Khan and Zafar Khan defeated them 
near Jalandhar and drove them back with great slaughter (February 
7, 1298). 

The victory enhanced the prestige of ‘Ala-ud-din, who now 
meted drastic punishments to those nobles, whose loyalty he had 
recently purchased by bribes, as he considered them too fickle. Some 
were put to death; some were blinded; some imprisoned for life; 
and the property of all was confiscated. Thus the master traitor 
punished all those who were guilty of infidelity. 

2. Early Campaigns 

In the latter half of 1298, 7 ‘Ala-ud-din sent an expedition under 
Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan to Gujarat whose wealth and flourish¬ 
ing ports attracted his attention. Ulugh Khan invaded Jaisalmer 
during his march and, after he joined Nusrat Khan, the two generals 
made an unsuccessful raid on Chitor. They invaded Gujarat and 
took its capital Anhilwara. The Vaghela king Karna (Rai Karan 
of the Muslim chronicles) offered some resistance near Ahmadabad 
but being defeated by Ulugh Khan, took to flight. His queen 
Kamala Devi and his treasures, however, fell into the hands of the 
invaders. 8 Gujarati sources, including Merutuiiga’s Vichdrasrem, a 
contemporary work, ascribe ‘Ala-u-din’s attack and Muslim success 
to the betrayal of Karna’s minister Madhava. There may be some 
truth in the story, though we cannot be quite definite about it. The 
Muslim generals advanced as far as Surat and then marched into 
Saurashtra, where they captured the city of Somanatha. The famous 
temple of Somanatha was plundered, and its idol, which had been 
set up after its sack by Mahmud of Ghazni, was sent to Delhi, where 
it was laid down for the faithful to tread upon. Nusrat Khan plund¬ 
ered the rich port of Cambay and obtained an immense booty. He 
also secured there the handsome young Hindu slave named Kafur 
who was known as Hazardinar! as his master had originally bought 
him for one thousand dinars. According to Wassiaf the invaders 
thoroughly sacked the country and ruthlessly slaughtered its people. 

After establishing Muslim authority in Gujarat, the victorious 
generals set out for the capital, but on the way troubles broke out 


19 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


near Jalor over the distribution of the plunder. The soldiers were 
subjected to brutal torture to extort confession, and they, mostly 
‘New Muslims’, revolted and killed Nusrat Khan’s brother and a 
nephew 7 of the King. Nusrat Khan and Ulugh Khan were, however, 
equal to the occasion. They rallied the loyal soldiers by beat of 
drums, defeated the rebels and pursued them with great slaughter. 
The chief conspirators escaped to the court of the Hindu chieftains, 
but ‘Ala-ud-din punished them by imprisoning their wives and 
children. Even this did not ally the wrath of Nusrat Khan, who de¬ 
livered the wives of his brother’s murderers to the scavengers of 
Delhi; while their children were cut to pieces in their mothers’ 
presence. This wanton brutality is condemned with righteous in¬ 
dignation by the contemporary chronicler Barani. 

In the same year that he sent Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan to 
conquer Gujarat, ‘Ala-ud-din had to despatch Zafar Khan against the 
Mongols, who had invaded India under Saldi and captured Sehwan 
(Siwastan 9 ). Zafar Khan invested the fortress and, having recovered 
it, returned to Delhi with a large number of prisoners including 
Saldi and his brother. This easy and brilliant achievement of Zafar 
Khan made him a hero, but bred jealous apprehension of the King 
as well as Ulugh Khan, whose victories in Multan and Gujarat he 
had eclipsed. 

‘Ala-ud-din’s ambition now knew no bounds. He conceived the 
idea of founding a new religion and imagined that like the Prophet 
of Islam who had four companions, namely Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Usman 
and ‘All, he had four valiant and faithful generals: Ulugh Khan, 
Zafar Khan, Nusrat Khan and Alp Khan. He dreamed of world 
conquest and assumed the title of Alexander the Second (Sikandar 
Sani) on his coins as well as in the public prayers. Although his 
courtiers realized the absurdity of his extravagant plans, none dared 
speak out the truth. It was the kotwal of Delhi, ‘Ala-ul-Mulk, who, 
on being consulted, at great personal risk, correctly advised the 
King by pointing out that religion sprang from divine inspiration 
and not from human intellect and wisdom: it was the function of 
prophets, not of kings; and that world conquest would be inexpe¬ 
dient, when there were so many kingdoms in India which remained 
unconquered, and while his kingdom was facing the great menace 
of Mongol invasions. ‘ Ala-ul-Mulk’s homily opened the eyes of 
‘Ala-ud-din who not only confessed his errors, but amply rewarded 
the kotwal and assured him that he would act accordingly. 

The soundness of the kotwaVs advice was soon confirmed by a 
serious Mongol invasion of India towards the end of 1299. A vast 
horde of 200,000 Mongols under Qutlugh Khvaja, a descendant of 


20 


THE KHALJ! DYNASTY 


Chingiz Khan, crossed the Sindhu and marched to the vicinity of 
Delhi to invest the city and conquer the country. People from the 
surrounding districts flocked to the capital in panic and crowded 
its streets, markets and mosques. The situation became grave, as 
the enemy blockaded the capital and threatened it with starvation. 
‘Ala-ud-din marched to Kill, north of the capital, and attacked the 
Mongols. Though ‘Ala-ud-din repulsed the enemy’s attack on the 
centre, it was Zafar Khan who took the offensive; he charged the 
Mongol left vehemently and drove them back with terrible slaughter, 
till he was surrounded and outnumbered by the enemy. He lost his 
life fighting to the end, as he received no reinforcement either from 
Ulugh Khan who commanded the left wing or from the King, both 
of whom were jealous of the hero. Zafar Khan’s valour struck 
terror into the enemy’s heart and the Mongols beat a hasty retreat 
the same night under the cover of darkness. For ‘Ala-ud-din it was 
a double victory: the defeat of the powerful enemy and the death 
of a too powerful servant. 

The strong fortress of Ranthambhor, which had baffled Jalal- 
ud-din, now attracted the attention of his ambitious nephew for two 
reasons: one was its strategical importance as one of the strongest 
fortresses of Hindusthan and the other, the asylum given to the 
Mongol rebels by its ruler Hamir Deva. ‘Ala-ud-din despatched 
Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan against the Chauhan prince, and in 
due course the Khalil troops besieged the fort of Ranthambhor. 
Nusrat Khan was fatally struck by a missile thrown by the garrison. 
The besiegers, disheartened by this incident, were surprised bv the 
Rajputs and forced to retreat. ‘Ala-ud-dln, therefore, marched in 
person towards Ranthambhor with a large army. On the way at 
Tilpat, about twelve miles east of Delhi, an attempt was made by 
his nephew Akat Khan to murder him, but the plan failed. 

‘Ala-ud-dln now marched on to Ranthambhor, which Ulugh 
Khan had meanwhile besieged again. During the progress of the 
siege the King received report that his sister’s sons, ‘Umar Khan, 
governor of Radaun, and Mang'u Khan, governor of Awadh, had re¬ 
volted. They were, however, soon captured and sent to Rantham¬ 
bhor, where their eyes were gouged out in the presence of the King, 
and their families and followers were put to death. 

Close on the heels of the abortive revolt of his nenhews came 
the report of a serious insurrection at Delhi (May, 1301), led by 
an old officer named Haji Maula. He killed the kotmal of Delhi, 
plundered the treasury, and raised to the throne a Savyid oopularlv 
known as Shahinshah, who was descended through his mother from 
Iltutmish. ‘Ala-ud-din, who received the report of this outbreak 

21 ’ 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


three days later, despatched Malik Hamld-ud-din, entitled Amlr-i- 
Kuh, to Delhi. Hamid-ud-dln was able to defeat the rebels and put 
HajI Maula as well as the puppet king to death. 

‘Ala-ud-din now carried on the siege of Ranthambhor with great 
vigour and infused fresh morale into his troops, who had begun to 
despair of success before the impregnable walls of the fort. Ulti¬ 
mately, shortage of provisions led to famine, which put the garrison 
to extreme hardship. Hamir Deva sent his minister Ranmal to 
‘Ala-ud-din to negotiate peace, but he deserted to the invaders along 
with his followers. As there was no hope, women performed jauhar; 
Hamir Deva with his Raiputs died fighting; and the fort capitulated 
on July 11, 1301. ‘Ala-ud-din put to death Ranmal and other Raj¬ 
puts who had joined him and had proved faithless to their master. 

3. New Regulations 

The series of revolts, referred to above, convinced ‘Ala-ud-din 
that there was something amiss in the existing state of things. Al¬ 
ready, while he was engaged in the siege of Ranthambhor, he had 
consulted the prominent counsellors, and after careful deliberations 
he had come to the conclusion that four factors were responsible 
for the disease in the body politic. Firstly, the King was negligent 
and ignorant of the condition of people. Secondly, drinking led 
to convivial gatherings, which were the most fruitful breeding 
grounds of conspiracies. Thirdly, intermarriage and frequent dis¬ 
course among the nobles made them a compact body dangerous to 
the State. Fourthly, wealth gave the people both power and leisure 
for evil thoughts and rebellions 93 After returning to Delhi, ‘Ala- 
ud-dln took active remedial measures so that such rebellions might 
not recur in future. By a stroke of his pen he revoked all grants 
and pensions and resumed all lands, which were held as milk (pro¬ 
prietory rights), indm (gifts), idrarat (pensions) and waqf (pious 
endowments), all of which were almost exclusively held by Mus¬ 
lims. 10 State officials were instructed to extort money from the 
people with extreme sternness and, according to the contemporary 
chronicler, the instructions were so faithfully carried out that, ex¬ 
cepting the big nobles and the officers of the State or wealthy mer¬ 
chants and bankers, no one possessed gold. The result was that 
people had to remain so busy about earning their livelihood that 
they had hardly any time to think of rebellion. The second mea¬ 
sure that ‘Ala-ud-din adopted was to establish a network of espionage, 
by which he kept himself informed of the doings of the nobles and all 
occurrences of importance to the State. Even the activities of the 
people in the market place were reported to the king; and so effi- 


22 


THE KHALJ! DYNASTY 


cient was the intelligence service that the nobles did hardly dare 
to speak among themselves in public. The third measure of ‘Ala- 
ud-dln was prohibition. The sale and use of wine and intoxicating 
drugs were strictly forbidden at Delhi; and drastic punishment 
was meted out to those who were guilty of violation. ‘Ala-ud-din 
himself set the example by abstaining from drink, breaking all wine 
vessels, and emptying his cellar into the streets. But in spite of 
the vigorous supervision of the Intelligence Department and the 
brutal punishments given to the offenders, Delhi could not be made 
absolutely dry. The King bowed to the reality and permitted the 
private manufacture and use of drink. Drinking was, however, 
restrained as its public sale and use were prohibited, and convivial 
parties were stopped. ‘Ala-ud-din’s objective was political and not 
moral; and it was realized. The fourth measure of the King prohi¬ 
bited all sorts of gatherings in the houses of nobility and inter¬ 
marriage between members of the nobles without his special leave. 

4. Measures against the Hindus 

‘Ala-ud-din next turned his attention to check the power and 
influence of the Hindu officials named kkut, chaudhri, and muqad- 
dam. 1L The first term, otherwise unknown, probably signified the 
class later known as zamindar, while the other two denoted, res¬ 
pectively, the headman of iparganas and villages. These three 
classes of people were hereditary collectors of revenue on behalf of 
the King, and it was alleged that they appropriated to themselves 
as much of the State revenue as they could, evaded payment of 
taxes, and even ignored the Government. As the chronicler describes, 
they ‘ride upon fine horses, wear fine clothes, shoot with Persian 
bows, make war upon each other, and go out hunting. . . and hold 
drinking and convivial parties’. ‘Ala-ud-din sought to curb their 
powers by depriving them of all the special privileges which they 
enjoyed at the expense of the State. The standard of the revenue- 
demand was raised to one-half of the gross produce. The perqui¬ 
sites realized by the chiefs were abolished and all concessions with¬ 
drawn; they were to pay land-revenue at the full rate and their 
land was to be brought under assessment; and all discriminations 
were done away with between the chief and the humblest peasant 
(khut and baldhar). The land-revenue was to be assessed by the 
method of measurement on the basis of standard yields. Though 
the system did exist in India before the Muslim conquest, ‘Ala-ud- 
din was the first Muslim ruler who introduced it; and it certainly 
marked an advance upon the sharing system, which was then preva¬ 
lent. Besides, the King imposed two new taxes: a grazing-tax on 
all milch cattle and a house-tax. As a result of these legislations, 


23 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the objectives of the king were realized, though it may be question¬ 
ed if the measures were economically sound. The motives of ‘Ala- 
ud-din were decidedly political. The high revenue-demand impo¬ 
verished the peasants so much that the very source of the revenue- 
collectors for extra profit was dried up, while the assessment of 
their land reduced them to the condition of peasants; and besides 
the loss of perquisites they had now to pay additional taxes. In a 
sense the regulations were favourable to the peasants, as the revenue- 
collectors had also to bear the burden along with them. If the 
contemporary chronicler is to be believed, these regulations were 
strictly enforced. The chiefs ( khuts ) and the headmen of parganas 
as well as villages—they were all Hindus—were so much impoverish¬ 
ed that no gold or silver was to be found in the houses of the 
Hindus; they could not afford to procure horses or weapons; and 
their wives had to serve for wages in the houses of the Muslims. 
“The people”, we are told by Barani, “were brought to such a state 
of obedience that one revenue officer would string twelve khuts, 
muqaddams and chaudhris together by the neck and enforce pay¬ 
ment by blows.” Great credit was due to the deputy minister of 
finance, Sharaf Qaini, and his officials for the efficient operation 
of these regulations; but they became so unpopular that no one 
would offer the hand of his daughter to a revenue officer. 12 

Two points should be noticed in connection with these regula¬ 
tions. They operated mainly in the central portion of the kingdom, 
and the victims of these measures were Hindus. It has been urged 
by some scholars 13 that “when ‘Ala-ud-din had not spared the 
Muslims or hesitated to deprive them of peculiar privileges, there 
was no reason why he should have shown any favour to the Hindu 
officials”. There are, however, good grounds to believe that in 
dealing with the Hindus, ‘Ala-ud-din was also actuated by communal 
considerations. This clearly follows from the prefatory remarks 
with which Barani introduces these regulations. The following is a 
literal translation of the passage by Moreland: “Sultan ‘Ala-ud-din 
demanded from learned men rules and regulations, so that the 
Hindu should be ground down, and property and possessions, which 
are the cause of disaffection and rebellion, should not remain in his 
house”. 14 i ■'! ! "■ ‘ 

Moreland adds that the Hindu in the above passage refers to 
the upper classes and not the peasants, 16 but this interpretation is 
at least doubtful. But whatever it may mean Barani leaves no 
doubt that the measures were dictated as much by political consi¬ 
derations as by hatred against the Hindus. Even on general ground 
the attitude of the Sultan to the Hindus must be regarded as very 
different from that adopted towards the Muslims. Some privileges 


24 


THE KHAUI DYNASTY 


were taken away from the latter, but there was no question of 
deliberately reducing them, as a class , to a state of grinding poverty 
and abject humiliation, which was the lot of the Hindus as described 
above on the authority of Baram. 16 

This view is fully confirmed by the statement of Qazi Mughis- 
ud-din of Bayana whom the King consulted as to the legality of 
these measures and certain other questions. Mughis-ud-din whole¬ 
heartedly justified ‘Ala-ud-dln’s rigorous policy towards the Hindus 
and pointed out that Islamic law sanctioned sterner principle, so 
much so that, “if the revenue collector spits into a Hindu’s mouth, 
the Hindu must open his mouth to receive it without hesitation.” 16a 
The Qazi, however, declared mutilation, torture and other barbarous 
punishments prescribed by the king as un-Islamic and illegal; while 
he condemned ‘Ala-ud-dln’s appropriation of the wealth of Devagiri 
and his huge expenditure as unlawful, as the king had no unlimited 
rights upon the public treasury: “all the krors of money and valu¬ 
ables which you take from the treasury and bestow upon your 
women, you will have to answer for in the day of account”. ‘Ala- 
ud-dln, who got excited during the discussion, spoke not a word to 
the Qazi and retired. As the Qazi next day proceeded to the court 
from home, he was prepared for death, and bade his family farewell. 
He received a pleasant shock, however, when he was kindly receiv¬ 
ed and presented with a robe and a thousand tankas by the King, 
who appreciated his opinion. The King said that he did not know 
what was lawful and unlawful, but followed what he thought to be 
for the good of the State or suitable for the emergency. Here we 
have ‘Ala-ud-dln’s conception of sovereignty, in which the State was 
to be independent of the ‘ularna’. As Barani says: 4 When he became 
king, he came to the conclusion that policy and government are one 
thing, and the rules and decrees of law are another. Royal com¬ 
mands belong to the king, legal decrees rest upon the judgment of 
qazis and muftis He was gratified to learn that his treatment of the 
Hindus was in full accordance with Islamic law and assured the Qazi 
that he had given orders that the Hindus shall not be allowed to 
possess more than what is required for a bare subsistence. 

5. Expedition to Warangal and Chitor 

Towards the end of 1302 or in the beginning of the next year, 
Ala-ud-dln sent an expedition to Warangal under the command of 
Fakhr-ud-dm Jauna 17 and Chhajju, nephew of Nusrat Khan. The 
expedition which started from Kara took the eastern route through 
Bengal and Orissa. The chroniclers are silent about the reason 
why this unusual route was preferred to the easier and shorter one 


t 


25 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


through Ellichpur. It is quite possible, as K. S. Lai suggests, that 
‘Ala-ud-din, who was consolidating his position in Northern India, 
sent the expedition both against Shams-ud-dln Firuz of Bengal 
who had assumed the title of Sultan and asserted independence, 
as well as against the kingdom of Telingana. The account of the 
expedition, as given in the Muslim chronicles, is meagre. From 
the South Indian Hindu sources it appears that the Muslim army 
penetrated into the heart of Telingana and reached the vicinity of 
Warangal. The invaders were badly defeated by the Telingana 
army and forced to beat a hasty retreat. 18 The inglorious end of 
the expedition possibly explains the indifference of the Muslim 
chroniclers. i • ! ' ! j 

On January 29, 1303, ‘Ala-ud-din set out on his memorable 
campaign for the conquest of Chitor. On arrival at Chitor, he 
surrounded the town and raised his canopy on a hillock known as 
Chitori. He then besieged the fort with a strong army, but receiv¬ 
ed strong resistance from the Rajputs under Rana Ratan Singh. No 
impression was made on the fortress by the attacks of catapults 
and ballistae, nor could it be scaled by ladders (pdshtb). The Raj¬ 
puts offered heroic resistance for about seven months and then, 
after the women had perished in the flames of jauhar, the fort 
surrendered on August 26, 1303. Thirty thousand Rajputs were 
put to the sword. According to the Rajput sources Ratan Singh 
was among the slain on the battlefield, 19 while Muslim chroniclers, 
Amir Khusrav and Tsami, state that the Rana of Chitor survived the 
battle and his life was spared by the king. Ratan Singh, however, 
is heard of no more after the fall of Chitor. ‘Ala-ud-din remained 
at Chitor for some days, and during this period many temples were 
destroyed and the population became victims of the fury of his 
soldiery. He returned to Delhi, after having appointed Khizr Khan 
to the government of Chitor. The Khaljis could not, however, 
long hold Chitor in the face of constant and stubborn resistance 
of the Rajputs. Khizr Khan abandoned it in 1311-12, and then 
Maladeva, brother of the chief of Jalor, ruled it as a tributary to the 
king of Delhi. But during his son’s rule, Hamir, Rana of Sisodia, 
took possession of Chitor and the whole of Mewar (about 
A.D. 1325 ) 20 , as will be described later in Chapter XIII A. 

The episode of Padmini has received a great deal of prominence 
in connection with ‘Ala-ud-din’s conquest of Chitor. The bardic 
chronicles of Rajputana represent the invasion of Chitor as solely 
due to the Sultan’s desire to get possession of Padmini, the beautiful 
queen of Rana Ratan Singh of Chitor, and they have woven round it 
a long tale of romance, heroism and treachery, too well-known to 
need any repetition. Later writers like, Abu-’l Fazl, Haji-ud-Dabir, 


26 




THE KHAUi DYNASTY 


Firishta, and NensI have accepted the story, but many modern writers 
are inclined to reject it altogether. They point out that the episode 
of Padmini is not referred to by any contemporary writer, and is 
first mentioned by Malik Muhammad JaisI in A.D. 1540 in his Padmd- 
vat, which is a romance rather than a historical work; further, the 
later writers, mentioned above, who reproduce the story with varying 
details, flourished long after the event and differ from one another 
on essential points. On the other hand, Professor Habib believes 
that there is a covert allusion to the Padmini episode by Amir 
Khusrav, a contemporary, in his Khazain-ul-Futuh, when he mentions 
the Queen of Sheba (Saba’). It has also been argued that the inva¬ 
sion of Chitor, one of the strongest fortresses of Rajputana, was the 
natural corollary to the expansionist policy of ‘Ala-ud~dln, and no Pad- 
mini was needed for his casus belli. As against this it should be re¬ 
membered that ‘Ala-ud-dln’s lust for a Hindu queen is proved by the 
known instances of Queen Kamala Devi of Gujarat and the daughter 
of King Ramachandra of Devagiri. It is to be remembered also, that 
Abu-’l Fazl definitely says that he gives the story of Padmini from 
“ancient chronicles”, which cannot obviously refer to the Padmavat, 
an almost contemporary work. On the whole, it must be admitted 
that there is no inherent impossibility in the kernel of the story of 
Padmini devoid of all embellishments, and it should not be totally 
rejected off-hand as a myth. But it is impossible, at the present state 
of our knowledge, to regard it definitely as a historical fact. 21 

6. Mongol Invasion and Market P.egulations 

The Mongols were not slow to take advantage of ‘Ala-ud-dln’s 
preoccupation in Chitor and the despatch of his army to a distant 
campaign in Telingana. A large Mongol horde of 120,000 horse 
under Targhl invaded India, made straight for Delhi, and blockad¬ 
ed the city. ‘Ala-ud-dln, who had returned from Chitor barely a 
month ago, could not face the enemy in an open battle. He was 
forced to retire to the fort of Slrl, and built defence lines by dig¬ 
ging trenches, protected by wooden planks. The Mongols plunder¬ 
ed the environs of Delhi and raided the very streets of the city. 

Luckily for the King, the invaders were ignorant of the art of 
siege warfare, and they could not afford to remain for long away 
from Central Asia. Consequently, to the great relief of c Ala-ud-dIn, 
they suddenly retreated after a stay of two months. 

The invasion of 1303 awakened ‘Ala-ud-dln to the urgent neces¬ 
sity of frontier defence, a task which he had hitherto neglected. 
The existing forts and outposts on the route of the invaders were 
repaired and new ones constructed; and all were strongly garrisoned 


27 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


with well-equipped soldiers. A large army was raised which was 
to be stationed at the capital and paid in cash from the royal trea¬ 
sury. The army was also reorganized. A descriptive roll of every 
soldier was kept in the war ministry and ‘Ala-ud-dm introduced the 
system of the branding of horses at the review, which stopped the 
malpractice of presenting the horse twice or replacing it by a worse 
one. The maintenance of a huge and efficient standing army, esti¬ 
mated by Wassaf at 475,000 horse, necessitated greater finance than 
the resources of the State would permit, but no increase in the 
revenue by fresh taxation was possible, as the people had already 
been taxed to the utmost. ‘Ala-ud-din, therefore, could not afford 
to pay his soldiers high salaries. He decided to solve this problem 
by lowering the price of all essential commodities, so that a soldier 
could maintain comfortable standard on a low salary. The army 
organizer thus turned to be ‘a daring political economist’. He fixed 
the prices of all food grains, all varieties of cloth including silk, 
horses, cattle, slaves, bread, vegetables, shoes etc. in fact, all 
necessary articles. He controlled supplies as well as transport and 
compelled the merchants to bring grains, cloth, etc. to Delhi market 
and sell them at scheduled rates on profit sanctioned by the State. 
All merchants, w 7 ho traded with Delhi, were required to register 
themselves in the office of the inspector-general of the markets. 
The peasants of the Doab region and the country to a distance of 
two hundred miles from Delhi were ordered to sell grains to re¬ 
gistered merchants at the fixed rate. The merchants dealing in 
cloths had to procure manufactured goods from places beyond ‘Ala- 
ud-din’s control, where the prices were higher, but they had to sell 
them at Delhi at the fixed rate and the King allowed them a margin 
of profit; this must have caused a considerable loss to the treasury. 
To guard against scarcity and famine, grains and cloth were stocked 
in stores established for the purpose and rationing was introduced 
when necessity arose. Hoarding and regrating were strictly for¬ 
bidden. These regulations were enforced by means of a highly orga¬ 
nized intelligence service and by drastic punishment for evasions. 
Bold and original in conception, the new economic policy of ‘Ala-ud- 
din evokes our admiration; but its defects and shortcomings should 
not be overlooked or minimised. The control of price and rationing 
obtained in and near Delhi only, and the regulations adversely affect¬ 
ed both the trade as well as agriculture. The narrow margin allowed 
to the merchant offered him no incentive: his wife and children 
had to be kept as hostages at the capital to force him to bring regular 
supplies to Delhi market. The peasant, who paid one-half of the 
produce in land-revenue, had to sell his grains at the scheduled rate, 
while he had to purchase his essential commodities at high prices 


28 


THE KHALJI DYNASTY 


obtaining outside Delhi. The capital was fed, while the country at 
large was bled: so large a quantity of grain was stocked at Delhi 
that Ibn Batfitah, who arrived there in A.D. 1334, consumed the rice 
stored by ‘Ala-ud-din. Only the army and, incidentally, the popu¬ 
lation of Delhi benefited by these regulations. Judged by the ob¬ 
jective which inspired them, they proved highly successful. Opposed 
as they were to economic laws, they died with their author. 

7. Malwa and the Mongols 

Having thus adequately provided both for defence and offence, 
‘Ala-ud-din despatched in 1305 a select army of 10,000 troops under 
'Ain-ul-Mulk, governor of Multan, for the subjugation of Malwa. 
'Ain-ul-Mulk inflicted a crushing defeat on the Malwa army led 
by Raja Mahlak Deva and Koka Pradhana, 22 who was slain. The 
Muslim army besieged the fort of Mandfi. Treachery revealed a 
secret passage to the besiegers, who surprised the garrison at night 
and took possession of the fort (November 24, 1305). Mahlak Deva 
fled but was caught and slain. After the fall of Mandu, Ujjain, Dhar, 
and Chanderi were reduced and 'Ain-ul-Mulk was appointed the 
governor of Malwa. 

The same year 'Ala-ud-dln had to face a formidable invasion 
of some 50,000 Mongols under 'All Beg, a descendant of Chingiz 
Khan, and Tartaq, who were joined by Targhi, the leader of the 
last campaign. They crossed the Sindhu and, avoiding the frontier 
garrisons as well as Delhi, which was now strongly guarded, march¬ 
ed directly on the Doab and Awadh, plundering, burning and mas¬ 
sacring on the way. The King sent Malik Nayak, 23 master of the 
horse, with an army of some 40,000 horse against the enemy. Malik 
Nayak met the Mongols near Amroha, and in the battle that ensued 
the invaders were severely defeated (December 31, 1305). Many 
of the Mongols were put to the sword, and ‘All Beg and Tartaq 
were captured and brought to Delhi along with a large number of 
prisoners. Targhi had already been slain before the Mongols pene¬ 
trated into the Doab. The prisoners were beheaded and their heads 
were built into the towers of the fort of Siri. The leaders met with 
the same fate, though according to another version, they were par¬ 
doned but put to death some time after. 

Next year (1306) the Mongols invaded India with a view to 
avenging the deaths of 'All Beg and Tartaq. The invasion took 
the form of a two-pronged campaign: one army under Kabak crossed 
the Sindhu and, through Multan, advanced to the Ravi; while the 
other, led by Iqbal and Tai Bfi, marched southwards towards Nagaur. 
‘Ala-ud-din appointed Malik Naib Kaffir, assisted by GhazI Malik 


29 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Tughluq, to deal with the Mongols. Malik Naib routed the forces 
of Kabak on the bank of the Ravi, and captured him with a consi¬ 
derable number of Mongols, including women and children, who 
were all sent to Delhi. Malik Naib then marched towards Nagaur 
and suddenly fell upon the Mongol force under Iqbal and Tai Bu. 
They fled across the Sindhu, but were pursued and totally defeated, 
and, if Firishta is to be believed, only three or four thousand out 
of fifty or sixty thousand Mongols could escape. With this huge 
body of prisoners Malik Naib made his triumphant return to the 
capital. The prisoners were trampled to death under the feet of 
elephants and their heads were built into a tower in front of the 
Badaun gate, traces of which were still visible when Firishta com¬ 
pleted his work early in the seventeenth century. Their women 
and children were sold as slaves at Delhi and other places of 
Hindusthan. 24 

The campaign under Kabak in A.D. 1306 was the last Mongol 
invasion during ‘Ala-ud-din’s reign. Duwa Khan, the Khan of 
Transoxiana (1274-1306), who had sent successive hordes of Mongol 
invaders to India, died towards the end of 1306. His death was 
followed by a period of confusion, and three Khans occupied the 
throne one after another within the brief space of three years. This 
undoubtedly accounts for the cessation of the Mongol incursions 
after A.D. 1306. ‘Ala-ud-dm’s warden of the marches at Dlpalpur, 
Ghazi Malik, took full advantage of the internal troubles of the 
Mongols by harassing them and making annual raids into their 
frontiers as far as Kabul and Ghazni. 

8. Expedition to Devagiri 

The relief from Mongol irruptions and the comparative peace 
established in the north enabled ‘Ala-ud-din to turn to the south. 
The gold of South India had raised him to the throne of Delhi and 
he sought to maintain it with the same. What he aspired to in the 
south was not annexation of new territory, but huge tribute from 
the Hindu kings with a mere acknowledgment of his overlordship. 
This is evident from the instructions he gave to Malik Naib, when 
he was sent on an expedition to Warangal. 

Ramachandra of Devagiri had failed to pay tribute for several 
years. According to another version it was his son Singhana who 
had withheld the tribute, and Ramachandra not only dissociated 
himself from his son’s action, but informed the Sultan accordingly. 26 
This might have been a diplomatic stroke on the part of the Yadava 
King to secure lenient treatment from ‘Ala-ud-din, in case the Deva¬ 
giri troops were defeated. In any event, non-payment of tribute 
was a just ground for invasion. 


30 


THE KHALJI DYNASTY 


‘Ala-ud-din appointed Malik Naib Kafur to lead the expedition 
to Devagiri with Khvaja Haji as second in command; ‘Ain-ul-Mulk, 
governor of Malwa, and Alp Khan, governor of Gujarat, were to 
collaborate with him along with their forces (1307). 26 With this 
expedition its leader begins to play an important role in the affairs 
of the State, so much so that from now onwards till his death the 
history of the Sultanate of Delhi is in reality the biography of Malik 
Naib Kafur. 

Malik Naib marched southwards, and being joined by ‘Ain- 
ul-Mulk and Alp Khan, reached Devagiri without any opposition, 
and defeated the Yadava forces (March 1307). Malik Naib sacked 
the city, took much valuable booty in elephants and treasures, and 
carried Ramachandra with his family and relations to Delhi. Rama- 
chandra paid homage to ‘Ala-ud-din, and was kindly received. After 
a stay of six months at Delhi, he was permitted to return to his 
capital with the title of Rai-i-Rayan and the addition of Navsari to 
his kingdom. The generous treatment of the Yadava king was a 
master stroke of diplomacy. Not only Ramachandra remained loyal 
to the Sultan, but rendered great service to his general Malik Naib 
during his southern campaigns. Indeed, Devagiri served as the base 
for Khalji military operations in the Deccan and the Far South. 

This expedition to Devagiri is somewhat inextricably mixed up 
with the last phase of the Hindu rule in Gujarat. The Vaghela king 
Karna, after his defeat at the hands of Ulugh Khan and Nusrat 
Khan, mentioned above, seems to have recaptured Gujarat, and a 
second expedition was necessary for the final conquest of Gujarat. 27 
The fate or subsequent history of Karna is not definitely known. 
But where history fails, romance often takes its place. So it has 
been the case with Karna. The famous poet Amir Khusrav has 
immortalised the love of Devala Devi, the daughter of Karna, and 
Khizr Khan, the son of ‘Ala-ud-dln, in a poetical work called the 
‘Ashiqa, and woven a romantic story round this theme. This has 
since passed current as history, mainly through its acceptance by 
Firishta; it may be summed up as follows:— 

The Vaghela king Karna, after his flight from Gujarat, found 
refuge in the court of King Ramachandra of Devagiri, and ruled 
over a small principality in Baglana, as his vassal. This formed 
an additional ground for sending the punitive expedition under 
Malik Naib Kafur against Ramachandra. When this expedition was 
being sent, Kamala Devi, the ex-queen of Karna, and now a 
favourite wife of ‘Ala-ud-din, requested the Sultan to take this 
opportunity of getting hold of her daughter Devala Devi, who was 
an infant of four years when she left her and was now living with 


31 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


her father. Accordingly Malik Naib Kafur was directed to secure 
possession of Devala Devi and send her to the court. 

When Kafur crossed Malwa he intimated to Kama the order of 
the Sultan. According to Khusrav, Kama readily agreed to do so, 
and was preparing to send his daughter to ‘Ala-ud-dln, when he 
suddenly took fright and fled away with her. But even Firishta 
could not swallow this, and so he gives a different account. Accord¬ 
ing to his version, Kafurs demand for Devala Devi was rejected by 
Kama and then hostilities were commenced against him. Kafur 
encamped for two months at Sultanpur, but could not produce any 
impression upon Kama. Thereupon Malik Naib entrusted Alp Khan 
with the task of capturing the princess, and himself marched to¬ 
wards Devagiri. For two months Kama held against Alp Khan. 
Singhana, the crown prince of Devagiri, had asked for the hand of 
Kama’s daughter in marriage, but the Viaghla king, out of his 
Rajput pride, had declined it, though he was then under the gener¬ 
ous protection of Singhana’s father; but now in the face of grave Mus¬ 
lim peril he agreed. The princess was being escorted to Devagiri by 
Singhana’s brother, when accidentally she fell into the hands of 
a batch of Alap Khan’s soldiers, who were out on sight-seeing near 
the Ellora caves. The precious victim was sent to Delhi by the lucky 
general, who had already inflicted a severe defeat on Karna and 
forced him to flee towards Devagiri. 28 

This is, in brief, the account handed down by ancient histo¬ 
rians and generally accepted now as true. There are, however, good 
grounds to doubt the authenticity of the whole story, which is solely 
based on Khusrav’s poetical work, the ‘Ashiqa. Several scholars have 
challenged its historical character 29 and we need not discuss the 
question in detail here. But a few important points may be noted. 
According to Tsami, Kama was denied asylum by Ramachandra 
of Devagiri, and had to go to Tiling. This, if true, takes away the 
whole basis of the story. Then, it is very difficult to believe that 
a Hindu queen would willingly bring over her daughter from her 
father’s protection to share the life of shame, ignominy and dis¬ 
grace which a cruel fate had thrust upon her. It is equally difficult 
to believe that Kama would, even for a moment, entertain such a 
proposal as stated by Khusrav, the originator of the whole story. 
It is not necessary to hold, with some of the critics, that Devala 
Devi was a myth. She might have been a real person who fell into 
the hands of the Muslims like her mother. We may even believe 
that she was married to Khizr Khan. But the whole of the romantic 
episode of love between Khizr Khan and Devala Devi seems to be 
a mere poetical fancy. If we are to believe in Firishta’s statement, 
that she was only four years old when her mother was captured, 


32 


THE KHALJI DYNASTY 


she could not have been a girl of more than fourteen or fifteen when 
Khizr Khan fell madly in love with her and she reciprocated it* 
The subsequent tragic history of Devala Devi, as narrated by some 
authorities, also belongs to the domain of legends rather than sober 
history. 30 


9. Expedition to Rujputdna 

The powerful chief of Siwana, Sital Deva, refused to submit 
to the authority of Delhi, and the Khaljl troops had been investing 
the fort for five or six years without any success. So, in 1308, 31 
‘Ala-ud-din marched against Siwana, and pressed the siege with 
greater vigour. For months the Rajputs bravely defended the fort 
against heavy attacks of catapults and other siege engines, but they 
were defeated by the Khaljl troops, who succeeded in escalading 
the fort. Sital Deva was slain, while attempting flight to Jalor 
(November 11, 1308). The King returned to Delhi, after having 
appointed Kamal-ud-din Gurg to the government of Siwana. ‘Aia- 
ud-din’s military activities in Rajputana were completed by the 
subjugation of Jalor, which lies some fifty miles south-east of 
Siwana. 32 The conquest of Jalor did not prove to be an easy task 
as its ruler Kanhar Deva (Krishnadeva) offered a strong resistance 
to the Muslims who besieged the fort, and inflicted reverses on them. 
It was not until the arrival of Kamal-ud-din Gurg, whom the King 
despatched with fresh reinforcement, that the tide turned in favour 
of the besiegers. Kanhar Deva was killed in action and the fortress 
capitulated. With the fall of Jalor, ‘Ala-ud-din’s activities in Raj¬ 
putana came to an end, as the more prominent Rajput States had 
already been brought under the authority of Delhi. According to 
an inscription of A.D. 1301, Jodhpur had submitted to Delhi, 32a 
though there is no mention of it in the chronicles. According to Tod, 
Bundl, Mandor and Tonk had been overrun by the Khaljl troops. 32b 

10. Expedition to Warangal 

The success of the Devagiri campaign encouraged ‘Ala-ud-din 
to send an expedition to Warangal, particularly as the failure of 
his early invasion of 1303 required the vindication of the prestige 
of his arms. On November 1, 1309, Malik Naib marched from Delhi 
and towards the end of December reached Devagiri, whose king 
Ramachandra offered him all sorts of help and “was as dutiful as 
any raiyat of Delhi”. He even sent ‘a force of Marhattas, both, of 
horse and foot’, in aid of the Muslim force. 33 Malik Naib entered 
the kingdom of Telingana by way of Basiragarh (Bairagarh), and 
invested the fort of Sirbar (Sirpur). In spite of valiant resistance 

33

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the garrison could not resist the attack; as usual women and children 
perished in the flames of jauhar, while the men were killed in ac¬ 
tion. Malik Naib left the fort in charge of the surviving brother 
of the commandant on promise of obedience to the King and hasten¬ 
ed towards the capital. On reaching the vicinity of Warangal, he 
established himself on the hill of Hanumankonda, commanding the 
city, and besieged the fort on January 19, 1310. Prataparudra, who 
was reputed to have an army of 900,000 archers 33a and 20,000 horse, 
took necessary steps to defend the fort against the besiegers, whose 
number was a hundred thousand. The fort of Warangal was made 
of stone and surrounded by a strong earthen wall and two deep 
moats, one protecting the outer wall and the other the inner fort. 
A night attack of the Hindus upon the besiegers, early in the course 
of the siege, proved abortive, and could not affect their operations. 
After strenuous efforts they were able to fill up the moat and made 
a wide breach in the wall; and in the middle of February they car¬ 
ried the outer line of defence by storm. After crossing the second 
ditch, they besieged the inner fort of stone. Prataparudra offered 
resistance for a considerable time. By adopting scorched earth 
policy he had laid waste the enemy’s route and cut off their postal 
system; so that for a month and a half Delhi received no news of 
Malik Naib. The garrison, however, was put to much hardship 
on account of overcrowding in the inner fort, and Prataparudra 
opened negotiations for peace. He sent his own image in gold with 
a golden chain round the neck to symbolise his surrender and a 
treaty was concluded. He gave 100 elephants, 7,000 horses, and all 
his accumulated treasures, and promised to pay an annual tribute. 
Among the jewels delivered was one ‘unparalleled in the whole 
world,’ as Amir Khusrav calls it, and this was possibly the Koh-i-Nur 
or Babur’s diamond which, according to Khafi Khan and other later 
chroniclers, Malik Kafur brought from the Deccan. 34 On March 20, 
1310, Malik Naib set out on his return journey with treasures too 
heavy for a thousand camels to bear, and on June 11 reached Delhi, 
where thirteen days later he was given a special reception by the 
King in honour of his splendid success. 

11. First Expedition to South India 

At Warangal Malik Naib had heard of the wealth of the king¬ 
dom of the Far South. On November 19,1310, he set out with a large 
army towards the kingdom of Ma‘bar, which lay at the extreme 
south of the peninsula.. Not the propagation of the true faith, as 
the Muslim chronicler states, but the greed of gold inspired the 
expedition. After a journey of about two months and a half through 
Kaithun (Kanhun in Raj put ana) and Khargan (Khargano in Nimar

THE KHALJi DYNASTY 


dictnct) Malik Kaffir reached Devagiri on February 4,1311, where the 
army halted for some days. Ramachandra once more rendered him 
all possible help and deputed Parasurama Deva, his officer on the 
southern frontier, to guide the Khaljl troops in their march on Dva- 
rasamudra. For, apart from his loyalty to the Sultan, Ramachandra 
had no love lost for the Hoysala king Ballala III, who had repeatedly 
encroached upon his territory. On reaching BandrI (possibly Ban- 
dir in North Kanara district) on the Hoysala frontier, Malik Naib 
sent scouts to gather information of the enemy. Ballala III was ab¬ 
sent with his army in Ma‘bar, where a civil war between the two 
brothers Sundara Pandya and Vira Pandya offered him an opportunity 
of recovering his ancestral possessions in the Tamil country. Malik 
Naib, accordingly, made a rapid march with 10,000 chosen cavalry, 
and in twelve days appeared before Dvarasamudra (February 26, 
1311). On learning of the Muslim invasion, Ballala hurried back 
to his capital and, in the face of the grave peril, appealed for help 
to the very Pandya princes, whose territory he had just invaded. 
Vira Pandya responded and sent an army to his help. Ballala, how¬ 
ever, considering himself no match for the invaders, decided to 
follow in the footsteps of Ramachandra and Prataparudra, and, re¬ 
jecting the counsel of his nobles and generals, sued for peace. He 
agreed to pay an annual tribute and surrendered all his wealth, 
elephants and horses. 

Malik Naib did not remain long in Dvarasamudra, but on March 
11 left for Ma‘bar, which was his main objective. The Pandya king¬ 
dom, known to Muslim writers as Ma‘bar, extended from Quilon to 
Nellore, about three hundred leagues along the sea coast. Malik 
Naib requisitioned the services of Ballala to guide his troops in the 
terra incognita. After five days’ strenuous march through difficult 
mountain route, the invaders reached the Ma’bar frontier. They 
crossed the passes of Talmali and Tabar and marched towards 
Birdhfil, the headquarters of Vira Pandya. 35 On account of the 
civil war between the two brothers, Sundara Pandya and Vira 
Pandya, it was a house divided against itself when Malik Naib ap¬ 
peared on the scene. But the Pandya princes, unlike other kings, 
did not shut themselves in forts which might be easily captured. 
They avoided open battle with the superior force of the invaders 
but frequently harassed the enemy, and thus made the entire coun¬ 
try the theatre of military operations. This strategy ultimately ex¬ 
hausted the invaders, and Malik Naib failed to secure the submis¬ 
sion of the Pandya princes. Vira Pandya had left Birdhul before 
it fell into Muslim hands, but about 20,000 Muslims in his service 
deserted to the invaders. Malik Naib’s operations were, however, 
hampered by incessant rains, as the country was flooded. In spite 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


of great hardship and opposition of the Hindus, Malik Naib marched 
on towards Kundur (Kannanur) in pursuit of the fugitive king. 
On the way he seized a squad of 120 elephants carrying treasure, 
but when he took Kundur, after a severe fight, he could not find 
Vira Pandya, v/ho had escaped to impenetrable forests. Malik Naib 
was obliged, after a short march, to give up the pursuit of the 
elusive prince and arrived at Brahmastpuri (Barmatpuri of Amir 
Khusrav, modern Chidambaram), 36 where the people were mas¬ 
sacred, the golden temple was razed to the ground, and its founda¬ 
tions were dug up. With rich plunder, including 250 elephants, he 
returned on April 2, 1311 to Blrdhul, where he sacked its temples. 

The temple of Snrangam and other temples in the vicinity of 
Kannanur were also sacked by Malik Naib. He then made a sudden 
descent upon Madura, the main capital of the Pandyas, and the 
seat of Sundara Pandya, but the Pandya prince had already fled 
with his treasures. Chagrined at finding nothing but two or three 
elephants, he set fire to the temple of Sokkanatha. At this stage 
he suffered a reverse at the hands of Sundara’s uncle, Vikrama 
Pandya, who had attacked him with a large force. 37 Malik Naib, 
however, managed to keep the vast booty he had captured, viz., 512 
elephants, 5000 horses, and 500 maunds of jewels, and broke his 
camp on April 25, 1311. 

The Muslim historians generally pass over the defeats suffered 
by ‘Ala-ud-dln’s army in the south, while Hindu sources refer to 
an unbroken series of Hindu victories over the Muslim troops. 
There is, however, no doubt that Hindu resistance against the 
Muslim invaders was very vehement, and the progress of Muslim 
arms was not as easy as Amir Khusrav and other Muslim chroniclers 
would have us believe. 

■ c ... 

The question has been debated by scholars whether Malik Naib 
retraced his steps from Madura towards Delhi, or advanced further 
south and raided Ramesvaram. Firishta refers to the building of 
a mosque by him at Sit Band Ramesar, which would obviously 
mean Setubandha Ramesvara or Ramesvaram in the district of 
Madura on the island of Pamban; but this identification is negatived 
by Firishta himself as he locates it on the coast of the Sea of ‘Uman 
(the Arabian Sea) in the vicinity of the port of Dvarasamudra. 
Some recent scholars have, therefore, come to the conclusion that 
Malik Naib did not advance beyond Madura and raid Ramesvaram. 
But it has been overlooked that while Firishta locates Sit Band 
Ramesar on the coast of the Arabian Sea in his account of the reign 
of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl, he definitely places it in the farthest south, 
six hundred kuroh or about twelve hundred miles from Vijaya- 


36 


THE KHALJl DYNASTY 


nagara, in his account of the Bahmani king Mujahid Shiah, and 
further states that Karnatak is in length from north to south, from 
the Krishna to Sit Band Ramesar, six hundred kuroh . He adds that 
Mujahid Shah visited Sit Band Ramesar and repaired there a mosque 
built by the officers of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl. So Firishta is contradic¬ 
tory in his statement. 38 In view of the short duration of his stay 
in Dvarasamudra, Malik Naib’s raid into the western coast and 
building a mosque there during the invasion of 1311 appears to be 
highly improbable. Neither Barani nor TsiamI refers to his raid of 
Ramesvaram; nor is there any mention of it in the Khazain-ul-Futuh. 
But in a later work, called the ‘Ashtqa’, Amir Khusrav hints at the in¬ 
vasion against Vira Pandya up to the coast of Ceylon. A raid from 
Madura to Ramesvaram, which was not very far, was quite possible 
for the powerful invader, who was master of speed and had marched 
a long way from Delhi with admirable rapidity. Even if Malik Naib 
could not have found time to build a mosque there in ‘Ala-ud-dliTs 
name, the possibility of a raid cannot be altogether ruled out. Haji-ud- 
Dabir, the senior contemporary of Firishta, vaguely refers to this 
in an embellished form, when he speaks of Malik Naib’s march to 
Ceylon and demolishing a temple there. However, in the present 
state of our knowledge it is not possible to come to a more definite 
conclusion. 39 

Judged by the major objective which inspired it, the Ma‘bar 
campaign was a brilliant raid. Malik Naib sacked temples and ob¬ 
tained such a huge booty by draining the resources of the country 
as had never before been brought to Delhi. But though he burnt 
and destroyed temples, raided towns and cities, and harried the 
country, possibly as far as Ramesvaram, he failed to secure the sub¬ 
mission of the Pandya princes. The Ma‘bar campaign was more 
spectacular than effective; it had no real significance in the history 
of Islam’s expansion in the south: it was par excellence a predatory 
raid. Malik Naib returned to Delhi after a journey of more than 
five months, and was received on October 19, 1311, with special 
honour by the King in a durbar held in the Palace of the Thousand 
Pillars at Sin. He had brought with him the son of his valued 
ally Baliala III, who was kindly received by ‘Ala-ud-dln and sent 
back to his father. 


12. Last days of c Ala-ud-din 

The triumphant return of Malik Naib Kaffir from Ma‘bar marks 
the climax of ‘Ala-ud-dln’s reign. But at the same time one could 
detect behind his grandiose success sure premonitions of his decline. 
Arduous work, intemperate habits, and advanced years ruined his 


37 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


health and contributed to the rapid deterioration of his character 
and abilities. In early life he had taken the advice of able coun¬ 
sellors, but in old age he was surrounded by sycophants and flatter¬ 
ers and concentrated all power in his own hands. He became an 
autocrat and his word was law. The coolness and discretion of his 
earlier days were replaced by a violent and suspicious temper. 
His failing health and declining abilities led to the weakening of 
his personal influence and consequent intrigue for power at the 
court. This reacted unfavourably on the administration and the 
empire, which revealed positive symptoms of decline. Ultimately, 
one man profited by these circumstances and made himself supreme. 
He was Kafur Hazardlnarl, Malik Naib, the brilliant hero of the 
southern campaign. 

The Mongols, who had accepted Islam and settled in the coun¬ 
try, had caused not a little trouble in the early years of ‘Ala-ud-dln’s 
reign. They were the mutineers in the army from Gujarat and 
were the main props of Akat Khan’s rebellion. They were discont¬ 
ented on a variety of grounds. They were not appointed to lucra¬ 
tive offices of the State, while the resumption of jag\r lands and 
heavy taxation reduced them to poverty. According to Firishta 
they were all dismissed by ‘Ala-ud-din from service. These mal¬ 
contents bitterly resented their lot and hatched a plot to assassinate 
the King, as he was hawking in the vicinity of Delhi. The plot was 
found out; ‘Ala-ud-din in his fury ordered a massacre of the ‘New 
Muslims’ en masse on an appointed day, and delivered their wives 
and children as well as property to their executioners. Some twenty 
to thirty thousand Mongols were put to death at his order, though 
the vast majority of them were quite innocent of the plot. 

Malik Naib, the favourite and all-powerful lieutenant of the 
King, had his rivals in Khizr Khan’s mother, Malika-i-Jahan, and her 
brother, Alp Khan, governor of Gujarat. The marriage of Khizr 
Khan, ‘Ala-ud-dln’s eldest son, with the daughter of Alp Khan 
on February 2, 1312, cemented the alliance, and the King’s declara¬ 
tion of Khizr Khan as the heir apparent the same year further in¬ 
creased their influence. Meanwhile Prataparudra of Warangal had 
sent twenty elephants and a letter to ‘Ala-ud-din, asking him to 
appoint his agent at Devagiri, to whom he might pay the annual 
tribute. At Devagiri the loyal Ramachandra died in 1311 and was 
succeeded by Singhana II, who had always been unfriendly to the 
king of Delhi and asserted independence. Malik Naib, who found 
the atmosphere in the capital too hot for him on account of the predo¬ 
minance of his rivals, prayed to the King to send him to the Deccan 
with a view to collecting tribute from Warangal and reducing the 
obstinate Singhana to obedience. 


THE KHALJl DYNASTY 


13. Second Expedition to Devagiri 

Malik Naib, accordingly, marched to Devagiri in 1313 and de¬ 
feated Sihghana II in a severe battle. Sihghana was slain and Malik 
Naib took possession of his kingdom. Henceforth the Yadava king¬ 
dom formed part of the Sultanate of Delhi. From his headquarters 
at Devagiri, Malik Naib carried raids into the territories of Telingana 
and Dvarasamudra, and asserted the authority of the king of Delhi. 
It seems that Malik Naib, on instructions from the King, either per¬ 
sonally led or sent an expedition into Ma‘bar with a view to restor¬ 
ing Sundara Pandya to his kingdom, as the latter, being worsted 
in the struggle for the throne, had gone to Delhi and sought ‘Ala- 
ud-dln’s help. Malik Naib, however, could not subjugate the entire 
Yadava kingdom. The kingdom of Kampili, 40 comprising Bellary, 
Raichur and Dharwar, asserted its independence, and he led one 
indecisive campaign against it. For about three years the great 
proconsul of the South sent tribute received from Y/arangal and 
Dvarasamudra, until in 1315 he was recalled by the King due to 
his serious illness. 

The absence of Malik Naib in the Deccan led to the undisputed 
supremacy of Malika-i-Jahan and Alp Khan at the court. She now 
married her second son Shad! Khan to the second daughter of her 
brother, on which occasion Khizr Khan was allowed to marry Devala 
Devi, daughter of Raja Karna. Meanwhile the health of the King 
rapidly declined. He had been suffering from dropsy and conse¬ 
quent fever, and was sadly neglected by his son Khizr Khan and 
his mother, the well beloved wife of ‘Ala-ud-dln’s early life. He had 
neglected the education of his sons who, being left free at an early 
age to do as they liked, took to drink and debauchery. In utter 
helplessness he recalled his favourite lieutenant from the Deccan 
and acquainted him with his troubles (1315). The astute Malik 
Naib availed himself of the opportunity for overthrowing the Alp 
Khan junta by poisoning the king’s mind against Khizr Khan, his 
mother, and his father-in-law; but he failed to secure the King’s 
sanction for killing Alp Khan as a necessary step towards his own 
safety. However, the relentless Kafur and his follower Kamal-ud- 
din Gurg murdered Alp Khan in cold blood. The junta was broken 
and Malik Naib became master of the situation. Khizr Khan was 
removed from the capital: he was first despatched to Amroha and 
then as a prisoner to Gwalior; while his mother was imprisoned 
in the fort at Delhi. These happenings at the capital reacted on the 
empire, and the army in Gujarat revolted after the murder of 
Alp Khan. Kamal-ud-dln Gurg, who was despatched there, failed 
to quell the rebellion, and was himself killed by the rebels. Troubles 


39 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


broke out in Chitor, where ‘Ala-ud-din’s protege Maladeva was 
challenged by Hammir, ruler of the Sisodiya branch. Devagiri as¬ 
serted its independence under Harapaladeva, son-in-law of Rama- 
chandra. It was in the midst of these troubles that ‘Ala-ud-din 
Khalji, the mighty king of Delhi, passed away on January 5, 1316. 40a 

It is difficult to analyse or pass a verdict on ‘Ala-ud-din’s 
character. As a king he was a ruthless tyrant, and as a man, trea¬ 
cherous and ungrateful. But with all these defects in his character, 
what carried him through was his resourcefulness, energy and capa¬ 
city for work to which was added his unbounded courage tempered 
with calculation and a penetrating common sense. He was a man 
of inordinate ambition, but also possessed bold and original ideas 
to which he would give practical shape with his genius for orga¬ 
nization and leadership. A vigorous commander, he knew how to 
carry his army through strenuous campaigns. A master of diplomacy 
and finesse, he revealed it in his wonderful blitzkrieg in Devagiri 
and the subsequent events which led to his accession. As a ruler 
he w 7 as vigorous and efficient; and as a reformer, bold and original. 
He held a very exalted conception of kingship; the absolute State 
was the ideal for which he worked—a State untrammelled by the 
authority of the ‘Ularna and unhampered by the influence of a 
powerful nobility. He understood the value of and prepared the 
ground for the separation of the State from the Church. He was not 
more bigoted than his age. Himself almost illiterate, he had noth¬ 
ing but contempt for learning and scholarship, though during his 
reign Delhi became ‘the rival of Cairo and the equal of Constanti¬ 
nople’ because of the throng of great men of whom the poet Amir 
Khusrav and Hasan were the most famous. ‘Ala-ud-din was the first 
Muslim imperialist and the first great Muslim administrator of India. 
The history of Muslim empire and Muslim administration in India 
really begins with him. ‘Ala-ud-din, Sher Shah, and Akbar—each 
marks a distinctive step in the evolution of Indo-Muslim history. 

III. END OF THE KHALJI RULE 
1. Mubarak Shah 

Malik Naib Kafur, who had possibly hastened the death of ‘Ala- 
ud-din, 41 produced to the nobles his master’s will, which he manag¬ 
ed to exact, disinheriting Khizr Khan and nominating Shihab-ud- 
din ‘Umar, a child of five or six, as his successor. The child was 
raised to the throne and Malik Kafur acted as regent. He married 
the infant king’s mother, who was a daughter of Ramachandra of 
Devagiri. He caused Khizr Khan and Shadi Khan to be blinded, 
and imprisoned all the other sons of ‘Ala-ud-din. He thought of 


40 



THE KHAUI DYNASTY 


destroying the entire family of the late king and the partisans of 
Khizr Khan, and of ascending the throne himself. The fateful hour 
arrived when the regent sent some foot soldiers to blind Mubarak 
Khan, ‘Aia-ud-dm’s third son. As they approached the prince, he 
bribed them with his jewelled necklace and reminded them of 
their duty to the sons of the late king. Moved by gold and senti¬ 
ment, they came back; four of them rushed to the apartment of 
Malik Kafur and slew him just thirty-five days after the death of 
‘Ala-ud-din. 

The nobles then released Mubarak from prison and appointed 
him regent. For two months he acted as such, but when he felt 
his position secure, he blinded Shihah-ud-dln ‘Umar, and on April 
19, 1316 42 ascended the throne as Qutb-ud-dln Mubarak Shah. The 
foot soldiers, who brought about the murder of Malik Naib Kafur 
and the consequent accession of Mubarak to power, now aspired 
to the position of Praetorian guards. Two of their leaders, Mubshar 
and Bashir, were executed and they were dispersed and sent to 
different garrisons. Otherwise Mubarak began his reign with a 
policy of extreme moderation and leniency. Immediately after his 
accession he ordered a general amnesty, releasing all prisoners and 
permitting the return of all exiled for offences. He amply reward¬ 
ed the soldiers and officers, gave back the jdgirs and endowments 
that had been resumed, withdrew the market regulations and re¬ 
laxed the rigour in the administration. Prices of commodities rose 
high, but people who had suffered so much in ‘Ala-ud-din’s regime 
obtained relief; specially the landowners and peasants, who bene¬ 
fited by the reduction in the revenue-demand. The charming and 
popular king was, however, immersed in drinking, debauchery and 
pleasure, and the capital, following his example and due to his 
policy of relaxation, indulged in an excess of wanton sensuality. 
As BaranI says, ‘every house became a tavern’. Bribery, corruption 
and malversation ate into the vitals of administration, which was 
paralysed. Mubarak’s right-hand man was Hasan, an unknown slave 
from Gujarat, whom he entitled Khusrav Khan and raised to the 
position of chief minister ( wazir). 

In the first year of his reign Mubarak appointed ‘Ain-ul~Mulk 
and Ghaz! Malik Tughluq to suppress the revolt of Alp Khan’s fol¬ 
lowers in Gujarat. ‘Ain-ul-Mulk, who had already been summoned 
from Devagiri and deputed for this work by Malik Kafur, had ad¬ 
vanced as far as Ptiajputana. The royal force encountered the rebel 
leader at Patan. ‘Ain-ul-Mulk won over some of the rebel officers 
to his side and thus by diplomacy divided the rebel force and easily 
defeated it. Malik Dinar, Mubarak’s father-in-law, who had recent¬ 
ly been awarded the title of Zafar Khan, was appointed governor 


41 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


of Gujarat. Zafar Khan proved an able administrator and restored 
order throughout the province within a few months. 

In 1318, leaving Delhi in charge of Shahln, on whom he con¬ 
ferred the title of Vafa Malik, Mubarak marched towards the Deccan 
at the head of a large army with a view to recovering Devagiri and 
securing treasures from the Deccan princes. At the approach ol 
the army Harapaladeva fled to the hills. Khusrav tracked Harapala- 
deva to his mountain retreat and had to fight two or three battles. 
In the final encounter Harapaladeva was severely wounded, taken 
prisoner, and put to death by royal order (flayed alive according 
to Barani). Khusrav Khan was appointed to lead an expedition to 
Telingana and the King left for Delhi. 

A plot was formed by Asad-ud-din, son of Yaghrush Khan, 
£ Ala-ud-din’s uncle, to assassinate Mubarak on the way, but it fail¬ 
ed and all the conspirators were arrested and forthwith executed. 
Following the policy of his father, Mubarak caused all the twenty- 
nine members of the family of Yaghrush Khan to be put to death, 
though some of them were mere children and could have no hand 
in the plot. The coins struck at Delhi in 718 A.H. (A.D. 1318-19) 
in the name of Shams-ud-din Mahmud Shah prove the existence of 
a pretender at the capital, though it is difficult to say whether Asad- 
ud-din or the regent Vafa Malik intended to assume this title, or 
a ten-year old son of Khizr Khan was the object of this conspiracy, 
as Ibn Balutah asserts. Mubarak now became bitterly suspicious. 
From Jhaln he sent an officer to Gwalior to put to death all the 
three sons of £ Ala-ud-din, 

On his return to Delhi, Mubarak grew very high-handed and 
cruel. He summoned Zafar Khan from Gujarat and executed him; 
Hisam-ud-dln, half-brother of Khusrav Khan, was appointed governor 
in his place. The regent Malik Shahln was also executed on suspi¬ 
cion of complicity in the recent conspiracy against the king. Muba¬ 
rak now immersed himself in debauchery and appeared at the court 
in female attire with finery and jewels. The palace was full of 
women and buffoons, who did not hesitate to insult the highest digni¬ 
taries with indecent gestures and filthy abuses. 

Hisam-ud-dln, the successor of Zafar Khan, collected his kins¬ 
men and followers and raised the standard of revolt in Gujarat. The 
nobles and officers of Gujarat captured him and sent him to Delhi; 
but Mubarak ignored his crime and restored him to favour, as he 
was the brother of Khusrav Khan. Wahid-ud-dm Quraishi was 
awarded the title of Sadr-ul-Mulk and sent as the next governor 
of Gujarat. He proved an efficient and worthy administrator, under 
whom the province remained quiet. 


THE KHALJi DYNASTY 


Close on the heels of the revolt in Gujarat came the report of 
the rebellion of Malik YaklakhI, governor of Devagiri, who asserted 
independence under the title of Shams-ud-din and began to mint 
coins in his own name. A large force was sent against him and he 
was easily defeated, as his officers and army deserted him. He and 
his associates were captured and sent to Delhi, where his ears and 
nose were chopped off and his followers were severely punished. 
‘Ain-ul-Mulk was sent as the governor of Devagiri. 

Meanwhile Khusrav Khan was operating in the South. When 
he approached the vicinity of Warangal, he was opposed by Pratapa- 
rudra’s force consisting of 10,000 horse and innumerable foot- 
soldiers; but they were defeated. Khusrav Khan then attacked the 
cuter wall of the fortress and, defeating the garrison and killing 
the chief commandant, invested the inner fortress. Prataparudra 
was alarmed and made peace with him by agreeing to cede the 
strategic fort of Badrkot and pay a tribute of 100 elephants, 12,000 
horses, and gold, jewels and gems beyond compute. 43 

From Warangal Khusrav Khan turned towards Ma‘bar. As he 
entered Ma‘bar, the princes and the people adopted the old tactics 
of evading battle and carrying away all their treasures. He now 
thought of establishing himself independently in Ma‘bar. Probably, 
as BaranI says, he was maturing his plans to achieve his ultimate 
object of usurping the throne. But Malik Talbagha, Malik Tamar, 
and other loyal officers of the State gave a mild warning to Khusrav 
and acqainted the King with his evil designs. 

Khusrav was recalled to Delhi, but Mubarak was so much in¬ 
fatuated with him that, far from taking him to task or asking any 
explanation for his evil designs, he punished those well-wishers 
whom he held responsible for Khusrav’s failure in Ma‘bar. Tal¬ 
bagha was blinded, beaten and thrown into prison, and the jdgirs 
of both Tamar and Talbagha were seized. Khusrav now became 
supreme; no one dared to speak against him and some nobles join¬ 
ed him on selfish grounds. Khusrav’s growing influence enabled 
him to secure royal permission to bring his friends and kinsmen 
from Gujarat and raise a corps of 40,000 horse, composed entirely 
of men of his own tribe and loyal to him. Thus reinforced, he formed 
a plot to assassinate the King in his palace. To further his design 
he got possession of the palace, securing the king’s permission for 
his men to enter at night on the ground that he could not meet 
them at daytime due to his preoccupation. One of these, Jaharya, 
advanced towards the King’s apartment, and as he killed the chief 
guards, Mubarak rushed towards the harem. But Khusrav seized 
him by the hair and, during the scuffle that followed, Jaharya cut 


43 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


off the head of the King and threw it down into the courtyard (April 
15, 1320). 44 

Mubarak was an unworthy successor of his father. Frivolous 
and depraved, cruel and arrogant, Mubarak lacked his father’s abi¬ 
lity and vigour as v/ell as his genius for organization and leadership. 
In him the vices of ‘Ala-ud-din were magnified, but his virtues were 
lacking. Though he did not observe fasts and say prayers, he as¬ 
sumed the title of Commander of the Faithful and Vicegerent of God 
as well as Imam, and thereby made the kingdom of Delhi inde¬ 
pendent of the Caliphate. His predecessors, including the lordly 
Balban and the mighty ‘Ala-ud-din Sikandar Sdni, had all acknow¬ 
ledged the legal sovereignty of the Caliph. 45 Mubarak also dis¬ 
played hatred and animosity against the saint Nizam-ud-dln 
Auliya. 46 


2. Khusrav 

At midnight, after the murder of Mubarak Shah, Khusrav Khan 
summoned the prominent nobles like ‘Ain-ul-Mulk, Wahld-ud-din 
Quraishi, Fakhr-ud-din Jauna, Baha-ud-dln Dablr and others, and 
detained them in the palace till the next morning, when he ascended 
the throne under the title of Nasir-ud~dm Khusrav Shah. Mean¬ 
while his followers removed all possible claimants to the throne by 
killing two and blinding three of the sons of ‘Ala-ud-din, and per¬ 
petrated abominable crimes in the harem. Thus the Khaiji dynasty 
came to an ignoble end. 

Baranl, who gives the above account, is very hard on Khusrav 
Khan, and treats him with supreme contempt, as he was a Hindu 
convert. It is not unlikely, however, that Khusrav has been more 
sinned against than sinning. True, he was ignoble, cruel, and 
treacherous; but possibly he was not worse than either Mubarak or 
‘Ala-ud-din in this respect. He had been converted to Islam in 
childhood, when he was given the name of Hasan; and along with 
his brother fell into the hands of ‘Ain-al-Mulk during his invasion 
of Malwa in 1305. Hasan was attached to the body of the personal 
slaves of ‘Ala-ud-din and brought up at the royal palace. Muslim 
chroniclers, in their contempt for the crowned convert, describe 
Khusrav as an outcaste and low born. It is not possible to deter¬ 
mine the real name of the tribe or caste to which Khusrav belonged 
on account of the variants in the chronicles [Par war, Bar war, Bardv, 
etc.), and there is very little evidence to show that he belonged to 
a low caste. 47 Nor is there sufficient evidence to prove the conten¬ 
tion of Baranl that Khusrav Khan’s coup de main was the conse¬ 
quence of a Hindu revolution, and his accession ushered in a period 


44 


THE KHALJI DYNASTY 


of the triumph of Hinduism and the downfall of Islam. A consider¬ 
able number of his followers, members of his tribe from Gujarat, 
were Hindu, and after his accession, they might have oppressed 
those Muslims who were opposed to their leader. Probably some 
of them practised Hindu religious rites in the palace, and this offend¬ 
ed Muslim sentiments. But Khusrav Khan never aimed at the 
restoration of a Hindu monarchy; nor did he champion the cause 
of Hinduism. On the contrary, he had shown the iconoclastic zeal 
of a Muslim during his campaigns in the south. Khusrav regarded 
himself as a Muslim; the khutba was recited in his name, and his 
coins bear the title of Commander of the Faithful. 

After his accession Khusrav Khan executed some of the nobles 
hostile to him. He married a wife of Mubarak Shah and conferred 
titles and positions on those who had helped him. Randhol, his 
main prop in the conspiracy, was given the title of Rai-i-Rayan; 
and his brother Hisam-ud-dm was given the hand of a daughter of 
‘Ala-ud-dln and the title of Khan Khlanan. He did not fail to placate 
those who might prove hostile. On ‘Ain-ul-Mulk was conferred 
the title of ‘Alam Khan, and Malik Fakhr-ud-din Jauna, son of GhazI 
Malik, who wielded great influence among the nobility, was appoint¬ 
ed master of the horse. Wahid-ud-din Quraishi was appointed chief 
minister. With certain exceptions, he retained the services of old 
officers of the State and he was anxious to secure the support of the 
nobility. Both Amir Khusrav and Ibn Batutah state that he did 
obtain the support and homage of the nobles and governors. 

It was onb/ a small section of the nobility which was opposed 
to him. The murder of the late king with the consequent orgy of 
bloodshed alienated some, while there were others, orthodox 
Muslims, who saw in the accession of Khusrav the triumph of 
heathenism and great danger to Islam. They, however, formed a 
small minority; for there was no great sympathy for the Khaljls 
who had fallen. The spokesman of the opposition was GhazI Tugh- 
luq, governor of Dipalpur, whose son Malik Jauna was at the court. 
The astute warden of the marches raised the slogan of Islam in 
danger, which has always proved so effective a weapon in Muslim 
history. The first step he took was to instruct his son Malik Jauna 
to join him at Dipalpur. The master of the horse one day slipped 
away from Delhi, and the die was cast. Eluding the army sent by 
Khusrav Khan in pursuit of him, he safely reached Sarsuti (Sirsa), 
which had already been garrisoned by his father. GhazI Malik then 
sent appeals to the governors of Ueh, Multan, Siwastan (Sehwan), 
Samana, and Jalor as well as to ‘Ain-ul-Mulk who was at Delhi. 
Of these the governor of Uch, Bahrarn Aiba, alone responded to the 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


call of GhazI Tughluq. On the refusal of Malik Mughultai, gov¬ 
ernor of Multan, to join him, GhazI Malik incited the people of 
Multan to rise against their governor; and the rebels killed him. 
Malik YaklakhI, governor of Samana, who was loyal to Khusrav, 
marched against GhazI Tughluq, but was killed by his own men. 
Muhammad Shah, governor of Siwastan, who had been imprisoned 
by his mutinous soldiers, was released, when the appeal for help 
came; but he made a half-hearted response. Similar was the res¬ 
ponse of Muhammad Hushang, governor of Jalor. ‘Ain-ul-Mulk 
maintained his neutrality, though he assured GhazI Malik of his 
secret help. It is significant that GhazI Malik’s appeal was mainly 
to the governors of the western frontier and even there he found 
little response. He also failed to obtain the moral support of the 
great saint Nizam-ud-din Auliya. All this reveals the true nature 
of the Tughluq revolution which overthrew Khusrav Khan, and the 
motive of its author. The cry of Islam in danger was merely a 
pretext. 

Khusrav Khan sent a force, 40,(300 strong, under his brother to 
check the advance of GhazI Malik. The army marched to Sarsuti, 
but the Khan Khanan failed to capture it, and proceeded towards 
Dipalpur to meet the enemy. On the way the royal force encounter¬ 
ed GhazI Malik and was totally defeated; the Khan Khanan fled, 
leaving elephants and treasures to the victors. GhazI Malik, by 
forced marches, arrived at the vicinity of Delhi, and Khusrav Khan 
made desperate and frantic preparations to oppose him. He ad¬ 
vanced two and a half months’ pay to the soldiers and emptied his 
treasury to please his followers. Having organized his forces, he 
marched from Delhi at the head of a big army with a large number 
of elephants. At this critical juncture, just on the eve of the battle, 
‘Ain-ul-Mulk deserted Khusrav and left for Malwa. 

On September 6, 1320, the battle for Delhi was fought near 
Indarpat. Khusrav Khan fought valiantly and desperately till the 
evening, when a sudden attack of GhazI Malik upon his soldiers, 
who had dispersed for plundering, turned the tide of the battle. 
Khusrav’s army was totally defeated and fled in confusion. Khus¬ 
rav Khan fled from the battlefield and took shelter in the garden 
of Shad! Khan at Tilpat. Next day he w T as seized and beheaded. 
GhazI Malik rode in state to the Palace of the Thousand Pillars 
and, after studied hesitation and with the consent of the nobles, 
who pointed to him that there was no surviving prince of the royal 
family, ascended the throne on September 8, 1320, under the title 
of Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq Shah. 48

THE KHALJI DYNASTY 


APPENDIX A 

The date of f Ald-ud-din’s first expedition to Devagiri 

^ All modern writers except K. S. Lai give AD. 1294 as the date 
of ‘Ala-ud-din’s invasion of Devagiri. Tneir authority is Firishta 
who gives the date of this expedition as 694 A.H. which commenced 
on November 21, 1294. The only contemporary authority, who 
gives the date of this invasion, is Amir Khusrav, who says that ‘Ala- 
ud-dm left Kara on 19 Rabi‘-ul-akhir, 695, which corresponds to 
February 26, 1926 ( Khazain-ui-Futuh , Calcutta text, p. 8). Elliot 
is wrong when he states that 19 Rabi‘-ul-akhir, 695 corresponds to 
February, 1295. 

According to Baranl, Jalal-ud-dln marched to Gwalior in 695 
A.H., which commenced on November 10, 1295, and at Gwalior he 
received the report that ‘Ala-ud-dm had plundered Devagiri and 
was returning with an immense booty ( Tdrlkh-i-Ftruz ShdJu, p. 223). 
Now, we have from the Khazain-ui-Futuh the date of ‘Ala-ud-dm’s 
return to Kara as well: 28 Rajab, 695, which corresponds to June 3, 
1296. So it was obviously in May 1296 that Jalal-ud-dln got the 
news. 

If ‘Ala-ud-dm had started in December 1294, he would have 
spent altogether one year and a half in the Devagiri expedition. 
This would be too long, for according to Firishta (I, p. 96: Kanpur 
text) ‘Ala-ud-dm remained at Devagiri only for twenty-five days: 
he could not have taken seventeen months in marching to Devagiri 
and returning from there to Kara. 

TsamI (Madras text, pp. 228-9) says that ‘Ala-ud-dln’s plan 
was to return within two months, and from the accounts of the other 
chroniclers as well it appears obvious that ‘Ala-ud-dm planned a 
rapid campaign. We learn from Baranl (p. 222) that already dur¬ 
ing his Bhilsa campaign, ‘Ala-ud-dm had gathered information about 
the roads to Devagiri. A long period would defeat the very objec¬ 
tive of the campaign. It was undertaken without Jalal-ud-dln’s 
leave and it was a means to an end: through it he would attempt 
a coup de main against the King. Eighteen months would be too 
long a period for the purpose, as it would be difficult to prevent 
leakage of information. It appears obvious from all authorities 
that ‘Ala-ud-dm was in a hurry. It was improbable that Jalal-ud- 
dln should not have heard of ‘Ala-ud-dm’s activities in the south for 
a comparatively long period of one year and a half. 

Baranl, as already noted, was not very precise in his chrono¬ 
logy, and his statement that ‘Ala-ud-dln spent more than a year 
in the expedition seems incorrect. On the whole it seems more rea¬ 
sonable to accept the date of Amir Khusrav, viz., A.D. 1296 be¬ 
cause he gives the exact date of ‘ Ala-ud-dm’s departure from Kara 
and return to that place. 

[The date usually given for this expedition, A.D. 1294, was 
adopted in Vol. V, p. 195. But although no definite conclusion is 
possible, the date A.D. 1296, given by a contemporary authority, 
seems preferable, and has been adopted in this Volume, Ed.].

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


APPENDIX B 

The name of Ramachandra’s son 

The son and successor of Ramachandra, the Yadava king, dur¬ 
ing whose reign the first Muslim invasion of the South took place, 
has been named Sankara by almost all modern writers, from Fleet 
to Haig. Fleet, in his Dynasties of the Kanarese Districts (pp. 71- 
78) and in the Bombay Gazetteer (I, p. 530), has Sankara. Sewell 
in his work, A sketch of the dynasties of Southern India, (Madras, 
1883, p. 114), has Samkara (1309-13) and he himself says that his 
source of information is Fleet. ' R. G. Bhandarkar has the same in 
his Early History of the Dekkan (Bombay, 1885, p. 119). All subse¬ 
quent writers have generally followed them. 

Now, the name of Sankara does not occur in any Hindu or 
Indian source. Fleet himself has made this point clear in the fol¬ 
lowing remark about the sources for the history of the Yadava 
dynasty: “For the period after 1298, no epigraphical records, throw¬ 
ing any light on the history of this dynasty, have as yet come to 
notice. Our knowledge of what occurred then, and of the leading 
incidents during the previous few years, which led up to it, is 
derived only from the pages of the Mussalman chronicler Ferishta.” 
(Bombay Gazetteer, I. p. 530). In the footnote the translation of 
Briggs is referred to. Sewell also (op. cit., p. 115, f.n.) says that 
his authority is Firishta. 

Firishta (Kanpur text, I. p. 117 and Bombay text, I, pp. 204-5) 
has Sankaldev. Sankaldev is, of course, Sankara. But in the 
'Ashiqa of Amir Khusrav we have Sinkhan Dev (Devalrdni tea 
Khizr Khan, Aligarh ed., p. 85). In his translation from the ‘ Ashiqa, 
Elliot (III, p. 551) has ‘Sankh Deo 5 . The Aligarh edition is a 
collated text, based on several MSS. It seems that in Elliot’s MS. 
the letter N, (nun) has been dropped and it has been read as 
Sankh Deo. In manuscripts G (gdf) is often confounded with K 
(kdf) and vice versa (Steingass: Persian Dictionary, pp. 999 and 
1971). Sinkhan Dev is, therefore, nothing but Sihghana Deva. 
Venkataramanayya has incorrectly read the name in the ‘Ashiqa as 
Sahgama Dev (Early Muslim expansion in South India, p. 17 f.n. 10) 
and K. A. N. Sastri has adopted this reading (History of South 
India, p. 217). As Hodivaia (Studies in Indo-Muslim History, p. 373) 
has pointed out, the name Sihghana is to be found in the dynastic 
list of the Yadavas of Devagiri. Further, as between Firishta, who 
composed his work early in the seventeenth century, and Amir 
Khusrav, who was a contemporary writer, the authority of Amir 
Khusrav should be given more weight. In view of all these reasons 
it appears that the name of Ramachandra’s son and successor was 
Sihghana and not Sankara, as given by Firishta and accepted by 
modern writers. 

(Prof. Abdur Rashid reads the name, in the Aligarh text of the 
‘Ashiqa, as Sanghan Deo or Sankun Deo, but prefers the former. 

Thus the second letter is read by him as ‘gh’, and this supports 
the above contention. In view of the fact that the name Sihghana 
was borne by the greatest ruler of the dynasty, it is preferable to 


48 


THE KHALJI DYNASTY 


take the name of the crown-prince as Singhana. The ‘Ashiqa also 
gives the name of his brother as Bhillam, another familiar name 
in the family. As Prof. Rashid has pointed out, the author of the 
Futuh-us-Salatm speaks of Bhillam as a son of Ram Deo, but not 
as the only son, as is supposed by Venkataramanayya (op. cit.). 
We must therefore conclude that the Yadava king Ramachandra had 
two sons Singhana and Bhijlama. In Vol. V, pp. 195-6, the name 
of the former has been given as Sankara, following the usual prac¬ 
tice. But even though it is of long standing, the weighty arguments 
given above seem to be strongly in favour of the change, and hence 
the name Singhana has been adopted in this Volume. I am indebted 
to Prof. Abdur Rashid for the valuable information supplied by 
him. Ed.) 

1. The date is given as June 13 in Vol. V (p. 158). The actual date is 3 Jumadl- 
us-sanl, 689 A.H. As the Muslim day begins at sunset, 3 Jumadl-us-sanI, 689, 
begins at sunset of June 13, 1290, and ends in the afternoon of 14, and con¬ 
sequently the major portion of it covers June 14. The system of giving such 
dates as June 14 has been followed in converting Hijra dates into their corres¬ 
ponding dates in the Christian Era. 

2. A different view has been expressed by Pande (PIHC, X. 310), but his argu¬ 
ments are not convincing.

Devala Devi and regard the entire episode relating to them as pure fiction. See 
G. H. Ojha, Gujarati: Annual Number, 1933; K. M. Munshi, The Glory that 
was Gurjaradesa, Pt. Ill, pp. 225-226 (Bombay, 1944) and Pt. II, pp. 431-54 of

9. Siwastan or Sehwan in BaranI, p. 253, and Firishta, Vol. I, p. 103. ‘Isaml, 
p. 251, has SIstan which is obviously a slip for Siwastan. CHI , III, p. 101, has Sibl. 

9a. Firishta puts these reasons somewhat differently (Briggs, I, p. 344). 

10. Tripathi, Some Aspects of Muslim Administration, pp 255-6. As pointed’out 
by him, and by Moreland, ‘Ala,-ud-dln could not altogether abolish the system 
of grants, but he made them very sparingly. 

11. According to Tripathi (op. cit., 256) these Hindu chiefs held lands from the 
State on condition of paying a stipulated amount of revenue and are to be dis¬ 
tinguished from autonomous rulers who were allowed to rule over their terri¬ 
tories on condition of payment of fixed amount to the Delhi King as tribute. 
For Khut cf. also Moreland, The Agrarian system of Muslem India, pp. 224-25, 

12. The passage, dealing with these ordinances in BaranI, pp. 287-88, is defective* 
and consequently it is difficult to understand what BaranI means. See More¬

complicated a question to be discussed here.

of the Warangal expedition, if he were a boy of twelve or thirteen. The year

pp. 120-130. It should be noted that both Abu-’l-Fazl and Hajl-ud-Dablr use 
PadminI not as a name, but as a woman possessing special attributes (Ain-i- 
Akbari, Nawal Kishore Text, Vol. II, p. 258 and Haji-ud-Dablr, pp. 787-88). In 
Hindi, PadminI is the name of a vroman of the most excellent of the four classes 
in which women are divided. It is in this sense that they use the word. For 
the story of Solomon and Bilqls, the beautiful Queen of Sheba, see Hughes, 
A Dictionary of Islam, pp. 601-604, London 1885. Amir Khusrav compares ‘Ala- 
ud-dln with Solomon and himself with his lapwing hudhud, which brought 
the news of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon. 

22. Koka seems to be a mistranscription for Goga, whose identification presents 

some difficulty. According to an inscription of V.S. 1354 ( Buddhiprakas , 
Gujarati, 1910, p. 77, ASI, 1935-36, p. 98) Saraiigadeva, the king of Gujarat 
(A.D. 1274-1296), defeated one Goga, and another inscription of A.D. 1439 
praises Lakshmasirhha, the Guhilot prince of Mewar for having defeated Goga- 
deva, the King of Malwa (ASI. 1907-08, 214). Firishla also calls Koka the Raja 
of Malwa (Briggs, p. 361), but Amir Khusrav calls Koka the Pardhan of Rai 
Mahalak Deo, King of Malwa, and adds that “Koka, the Wazir, commanded the 
army and he was stronger in the country of Malwa than the Rai.” ( Khazdin- 
ul-Futuh, HIED, III, p. 76. Tr. by M. Habib. JXH, VIII. 365: ‘Ashiqa, HIED, 
III. 544-45). According to Wassaf, about the year A.D. 1270, a king of Malwa 
died, and dissension broke out between his son and minister as a result of 
which Malwa was divided between the two (HIED, III, 31). It is possible, 
therefore, that Koka or Goga was the minister referred to by Wassaf who 
made common cause with his erstwhile king when the country was threatened with 
a Muslim invasion. See A.K. Majumdar: Chaulukyas of Gujarat, p. 182. (Ed.). 

23. BaranI, p. 320, has Nayak; Amir Khusrav, Khazdin-ul-Futuh, p. 38, Manik: 
‘IsamI, p. 301-2, Nanak. The name was either Nayak or Manik and the leader 
of the campaign was a Hindu as Khusrav states in the ‘ Ashiqa , p. 61. He is 
possibly the Manik, who saved ‘Ala-ud-dln from Akat Khan’s assault referred 
to by BaranI, p. 273. According to Firishta, Malik Naib and GhazI Malik 
Tughluq were leaders of the campaign. 

24. The account of the Mongol invasion of 1306 given by the chroniclers, particular¬ 
ly that of BaranI, is confusing. The above account is based on the Khazdin- 
ul-Futuh and the ‘ Ashiqa as well as Futuh-us-Salatin of TsamI, who agrees 
with Amir Khusrav in treating the campaign under Kabak as the last Mongol 
invasion. BaranI speaks of three campaigns in three different years; the first 
under Kabak; the commander of the second is not named; and the third under 
Iqbalmandah. Firishta plays havoc with facts and names. See Khazdin-ul- 
Futuh, pp. 41-46 and Habib, English translation, pp. 29-34; f . Ashiqa , pp. 62-63; 
TsamI, pp. 317-22; and JASB, 1870, pp. 43-47.

28. For a different version see TsamI, pp. 268-87. TsamI and Amir Khusrav (in 
the ‘ Ashiqa, pp. 85-87) make it a separate campaign. The account in the text 
is based on Firishta, who gives a detailed and systematic account of Devala 
Devi. Kama could not obtain asylum in Devagiri, obviously due to Malik 
Naib’s invasion, and fled to Telingana. 

29. This question of Devala Devi has been discussed by K. M. Munshi and Dr. B. 
Prasad in The Glory That Was Gurjaradesa, II, by K. M. Munshi, pp. 431 ff. 
and by A. K. Majumdar, op. cit. pp. 194 ff. See also Qanungo: The historicity 
Pf the love romance, ‘Devai Rani wa Khizr Khan’, in PIHC, HI, pp. 877-79. 
For a different view see A. L. Srivastava: Historicity of ‘Devai Ranl-Khizr 
Khan’ in the Is.C. 1956. He holds that there is little that is impossible in the 
basic theme of the * Ashiqa , which stands the test of historical criticism and is 
substantially true.

32. We have no contemporary account of the Khalji conquest of Jalor and have to 

rely on the later authorities like Firishta and Nensl. It seems Jalor was 
raided by Muslim troops in A.D. 1299 on their way back from Gujarat, though 
‘Ala-ud-dln could not have personally undertaken it as Nensl would have 
us believe. On the second occasion Jalor was invaded by Alp Khan and ‘Ain- 
ul-Mulk, while they were returning from Malwa; and Raja Kanhar Deva, 
alarmed at the success of Muslim arms in Malwa, offered his submission to 
‘Ala-ud-dln. Kanhar Deva, however, revised his policy, asserted indepen¬ 
dence, and defied the authority of Delhi, which necessitated the third and final 
invasion of the territory. Firishta places the subjugation of Jalor about the 
time of the expedition against Siwana, while Nensl places it in A.D. 1311 
(Khydt , I. p. 163). As the Khalji army was engaged in Siwana in 1308, a cam¬ 
paign after its fall against Jalor, which was in the vicinity, was quite probable. 
But NensTs date is to a certain extent corroborated by Jinaprabha Surl who, in 
the Tirthakalpa, refers to ‘Ala-ud-dln’s destruction of the temple of Mahavlra 
at Sanchor in the vicinity of Jalor in A.D. 1310; and modern scholars like Ojha‘, 
Reu and others accept it. .

CHAPTER III 




GHIYAS-UD-DIN TUGHLUQ (A.D. 1320-25) 

Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq, also called simply Tughluq, was the 
founder of the Tughluq dynasty. It is generally believed that 
Tughluq was the name of his family or of the tribe to which he 
belonged, and hence this cognomen is applied to all the members 
of his family. 1 But it is held by some that Tughluq was merely 
the personal name of the founder of the new dynasty, and was 
neither a family name, nor the designation of a class, clan, or tribe. 
In support of this view it is pointed out that the second king of the 
dynasty called himself Muhammad bin Tughluq (son of Tughluq) or 
its equivalents, and very rarely Muhammad Tughluq, while none 
of his successors ever used the word Tughluq as part of his name. 2 
But as sometimes the personal name of the founder is given to 
the dynasty, we may, following the present practice, call the ruling 
family the Tughluq Dynasty, and use the word Tughluq after the 
proper name, as names like Muhammad Tughluq or Firuz Tughluq 
are more familiar to us in these forms. 

According to Ibn Batutah, Tughluq belonged to the race of the 
Qaraunah Turks. But nothing is definitely known about this clan, 
not even whether it was Turk or Mongol. Marco Polo, a contem¬ 
porary foreign traveller, describes the Qaraunahs as a people of 
mixed breed, while some derive the name from Karana, the name 
of a mixed caste in India. The question has been fully discussed 
by several historians 3 in all its bearings, and while they generally 
agree that Tughluq was certainly a Turk, some are of opinion that 
far from being a Qaraunah, he was a lineal descendant of the Sas- 
sanian kings of Persia. The most probable view seems to be that 
of Sir Wolseley Haig who connects the Tughluq with the ‘Taghlik’, 
a tribe of Turks, now dwelling near Khotan. 4 

There is also a difference of opinion, even among the old autho¬ 
rities, regarding the early career of Tughluq, whose original name 
was Ghazi Malik or Ghazi Beg Tughluq. According to Ibn Batutah 
and Shams-i-Siraj ‘Afif, he came from Khurasan to India during 
the reign of ‘Ala-ud-din Khalji. On the other hand, Firishta states, 
as a result of his inquiry at Lahore, that although there was no 
authentic account in any book, it was generally believed that Malik 
Tughluq, a Turkish slave of Sultan Balban, married a woman of 
the Jat tribe, and their son was Ghazi Malik who later became 


52 


GHIYAS-UD-DIN TUGHLUQ 


Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq. Dr. M. Husain, who prefers this 
account to the older one, ignores the fact that this goes against his 
view that Tughluq was a personal name of the founder of the royal 
dynasty and not a cognomen. The story of the Jat marriage is in 
a way indirectly supported by ‘Afif who says that Ghiyas-ud-din 
Tughluq, when governor of Dipalpur, gave his brother in marriage 
to the daughter of a Hindu nobleman of the province, who was 
extremely unwilling but was coerced by threat to accept the propo¬ 
sal. It may be added that the issue of this marriage was the future 
Sultan Firuz Tughluq. 

But if we accept the view of ‘Afif that Ghazi Malik himself 
came to India from Khurasan during the reign of ‘Ala-ud-din Khalji, 
he can hardly be the son of a Jat mother. The statement of Amir 
Khusrav, a contemporary writer, that Ghazi Malik served under 
Jalal-ud-din Khalji seems to indicate, however, that Firishta’s ac- 
count is the correct one. We may, therefore, hold that Tughluq 
w T as the son of an Indian mother and, like his father, was in the 
service of the Sultans of Delhi. He distinguished himself by his 
successful defence against the Mongol invaders and ultimately be¬ 
came the governor of Dipalpur. He held the post till he was called 
to the throne under circumstances already described above. 

Tughluq proved to be an able ruler. His first concern was to 
restore the authority of the Sultanate in the Deccan. Prataparudra, 
the Kakatiya ruler of Warangal, had taken advantage of the dis¬ 
orders in Delhi, and not only threw off the yoke of the Sultanate 
by refusing to pay tribute, but increased his power enormously by 
extensive conquests, as stated above. 5 Owing to a singular lack of 
political wisdom he ignored or underestimated the Muslim menace. 
Instead of attempting to organize a united front of the Hindu rulers 
of Deccan and South India in order to prevent the catastrophe which 
had already overwhelmed him once before, he was now fully en¬ 
gaged in leading military campaigns against them and thereby 
frittered away his energy and resources. But he had to pay the 
penalty for his folly as soon as Tughluq ascended the throne. In 
the second year of his reign (A.D. 1321-22) the Sultan sent an expe¬ 
dition against him under the command of his son Juna or Jauna 
Khan, also Known as Ulugh Khan. The latter marched by way of 
Devagiri and laid siege to the fort of Warangal. Prataparudra 
offered a heroic resistance. The Hindus from all sides mustered 
strong to fight against the Muslims and frustrated all their attempts 
to capture the fort. The siege dragged on and the casualties were 
heavy among the besiegers. Prataparudra sued for peace, offering 
to pay annual tribute as before, and also to furnish elephants and 


53 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


treasure. Prince Jauna haughtily rejected the offer and vigorous¬ 
ly pressed the siege. 

But soon the Muslim army met with a terrible disaster. This 
was due to the desertion of a large number of nobles with their 
armies, but the exact cause of this defection is difficult to deter¬ 
mine. According to Barani, ‘Ubaid, a boon-companion of Jauna. 
deliberately spread a false report among the soldiers to the effect 
that the Sultan was dead and that a new prince now sat upon the 
throne of Delhi. ‘Ubaid also told the nobles that Jauna intended 
to kill them. Believing in these rumours most of the military 
leaders left the camp together with their followers, and then a 
panic seized the imperial army. The besieged Hindus sallied forth 
and plundered the baggage of the army of Jauna, and he fled with 
his followers towards Devagiri. Of the nobles and military leaders, 
who had deserted the camp, some met with disaster at the hands 
of the Hindus, and many suffered terrible punishments in the hands 
of the Sultan. Jauna, however, reached Devagiri in safety. Barani 
does not say anything about ‘Ubaid’s motive and seems to imply 
that he was actuated by a desire to create mischief. On the other 
hand, Ibn Batutah definitely asserts that Jauna intended to rebel 
against his father, and ordered ‘Ubaid to spread the false report in 
the hope that the officers and troops would swear allegiance to him. 
But the result was just the opposite, as the armrs rebelled and 
deserted the prince, who thereupon fled to his father with ten 
horsemen. 1 j 

Baranl’s account has been followed by later Muslim historians. 6 
Among modern writers Wolseley Haig and many others accept 
Ibn Batutah’s version, while Ishwari Prasad and M. Husain accept 
BaranI’s account. BaranI’s narrative fails to supply a reasonably 
satisfactory motive for the treacherous conduct of ‘Ubaid, an inti¬ 
mate friend of Prince Jauna Khan. On the other hand, Ibn 
Batutah’s account hardly fits in with two ascertained facts namely, 
(1) that while the Sultan punished the officers who deserted, he not 
only did not admonish the prince, but again sent him in command 
of a second expedition against Warangal in A.D. 1323; (2) the 
Sultan also appointed Jauna regent in Delhi during his own absence 
in Bengal. 7 ! j 

According to Muslim chronicles the second expedition was com¬ 
pletely successful. Jauna again laid siege to Warangal and cap¬ 
tured it. King Prataparudra surrendered and was sent to Delhi 
“with his elephants and treasures, relations, and dependants”. Barani 
adds that “the name of Warangal was changed to Sultanpur, and 
all the country of Tilang was conquered”. But this must be regard- 


54 


GHIYAS-UD-DIN TUGHLUQ 


ed as an obvious exaggeration. For, as noted above, 7a Prataparudra 
is referred to as the ruling king in an inscription dated A.D. 1326, 
found at Guntur. It is, therefore, very likely that even if he were 
taken as a captive to Delhi, he must have been released and was 
either allowed to rule as a subordinate chief or asserted his in¬ 
dependence. 

There is another question that may be discussed in this con¬ 
nection. According to local chronicles the Pandya kingdom of 

T . 

Madura (Ma‘bar of Muslim chronicles) was conquered by an army 
from Delhi in the year A.D. 1323. 8 This is supported by the fact 
that this province is included by Barani among the dominions of 
Delhi Sultanate at the time when Muhammad bin Tughluq trans¬ 
ferred his capital to Devagiri in A.D. 1327, although there is no re¬ 
ference to any expedition against this place led by him before this 
date. If we accept the date A.D. 1323 for the conquest of Ma‘bar 
by the Sultan of Delhi, it would appear very likely that Jauna car¬ 
ried on an expedition to this southernmost limit of India after his 
victory over Prataparudra. But, then, it is inexplicable why sufch 
a resounding victory should have been ignored by all the Muslim 
historians. 

But whatever we might think of this expedition, there is no 
doubt that after the conquest of Warangal, Jauna Khan led an 
expedition to the eastern coast. Barani simply says that he marched 
towards Jajnagar and captured forty elephants. An inscription, 9 
in a mosque at Rajahmundry, records that it was built in A.D. 1324, 
during the regime of Ulugh Khan. This show's that the latter had 
advanced as far as Rajahmundry. It is probable that from Rajah¬ 
mundry Jauna Khan proceeded towards Orissa. Bhanudeva II, 
king of Orissa, sent a large force to the frontier to defend his 
kingdom. According to Tsami, the only contemporary author who 
gives an account of this expedition, the Orissan forces were defeat¬ 
ed and fled, and Jauna Khan plundered their camp and took much 
booty. But the Puri plates of Narasimha IV credit Bhanudeva II 
with a victory over Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq. This probably refers 
to the same expedition, 10 and in that case, we must presume that 
Ulugh Khan suffered some reverse, and his expedition was not as 
successful as Tsami describes it to be. This is supported by the 
very cryptic reference to it by Barani, and explains the sudden re¬ 
tirement of Jauna Khan after a victorious campaign, which has 
struck modern historians as rather unusual. 11 

' .-W ^ 

Jauna was warmly received by his father on his return from 
the brilliant campaign. The Sultan honoured him and held great 
rejoicings, though these were partly marred by the news that the 


55 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Mongols had crossed the Sindhu and invaded Samana. But the im¬ 
perial army sent against them won two victories, drove them back, 
and took many prisoners. 

After having quelled a Parwari insurrection in Gujarat, the 
Sultan turned his attention to Bengal which had been an indepen¬ 
dent principality since the death of Balban. Ghiyas-ud-dln Tugh- 
luq decided to assert his authority over the province and started 
with an army at the beginning of A.D. 1324, having left, in charge 
of the government at Delhi, his son Jauna who was, according to 
some accounts, specially summoned to Delhi from Telingana for 
that purpose in January, 1324. The details of the campaign and 
its result will be described in Chapter, X E. It will suffice to state 
here that the Sultan succeeded in his main object. He defeated 
the Sultan of Bengal, Ghiyas-ud-dln Bahadur, and brought him cap¬ 
tive to Delhi. He confirmed Sultan Naslr-ud-din in the government 
of North Bengal with its capital at Lakhhawati. Eastern and Sou¬ 
thern Bengal, with capitals respectively at Sonargaon and Satgaon, 
were annexed to the Sultanate, and his adopted son Bahram Khan 
was appointed to govern them. 

In course of the expedition to Bengal, the Sultan defeated the 
Raja of Tirhut (N. Bihar). There is some difference of opinion 
among scholars regarding the date of this Tirhut campaign. Some 
hold that it took place when the Sultan was returning to Delhi after 
having settled affairs in Bengal, while others hold that the Sultan 
conquered Tirhut on his way to Bengal. But the evidence of ‘Isami 
is decisive on this point. His detailed account leaves no doubt that 
Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq invaded Tirhut on his way back from Bengal. 
Harisimha, the king of Tirhut, offered a stubborn resistance to the 
imperial army, and Ghiyas-ud-dln started for Delhi before the ruler 
of Tirhut was completely subdued, as will be related in Chapter XIII, 
D-II. 


In course of his return journey the Sultan received some alarm¬ 
ing news of his son’s conduct and general disquiet at Delhi, and 
proceeded by forced marches. What followed is thus described by 
Ibn Batutah: “As the Sultan neared the capital he sent orders to 
his son, Ulugh Khan, that he should build him a palace near 
Afghanpur. This palace was in the main a wooden structure, con¬ 
structed within three days under the supervision of Malikzada 
Ahmad bin Aiyaz, the superintendent of buildings, later known as 
Khvaja Jaban, the principal wazir of Sultan Muhammad. It rested 
on wooden columns and was so contrived that should the elephants 
step on a part of it the whole structure would collapse and tumble 
down. The Sultan stopped in this palace and fed his guests. After 


56 


GHIYAS-UD-DIN TUGHLUQ 


they dispersed, the prince asked the Sultan to allow him to have the 
elephants ride past him, and permission was granted. Shaikh 
Rukn-ud-dln informed me that he was with the Sultan at the time, 
when Jauna Khan approached him saying: ‘Maulana, it is time 
for the ‘Asr prayer, come and pray’. The Shaikh complied with 
this request, and the elephants were brought from a certain direct 
tion, as had been arranged. When they stepped over the palace, 
it immediately collapsed on the Sultan and his son Mahmud. The 
Shaikh said, ‘I heard the uproar and returned without saying the 
prayer. I saw that the structure had fallen, and the Sultan’s son 
was ordering pickaxes and shovels to be brought to dig out the 
Sultan, but he made signs for them to delay and the implements 
were not brought till after the sunset.’ When the Sultan was dug 
out he was seen bending over his son to save him from death. 
Some presumed that he was taken out dead; some apprehended that 
he was taken out alive and afterwards murdered. He was carried 
in the course of the night to the tomb, which he had built outside 
the city of Tughluqabad.” 12 

It will appear from the above account that Ibn Batutah defi¬ 
nitely accuses Ulugh Khan (Jauna) of murdering his father. The 
testimony of Barani, the only other contemporary writer, does not, 
however, support this view. After referring to the reception of the 
Sultan in a temporary pavilion, Barani states: 11 A calamity occurred, 
like a thunderbolt falling from heaven on the denizens of the earth, 
and the roof of the dais, on which Sultan Tughluq Shah was sitting, 
fell, and the emperor, with five or six persons, fell beneath the roof, 
and was united to the neighbourhood of God’s mercy”. 13 

It should be noted that Barani’s expression is somewhat vague. 
Some historians, both of old and modern times, have taken his words 
literally to mean that the pavilion was struck by lightning. But 
it has been pointed out that if that was Baranl’s intention to convey, 
he would have worded the expression differently. 14 

It has been suggested by old and modern writers that Barani 
dared not speak the truth unfavourable to Ulugh Khan, later 
Emperor Muhammad bin Tughluq, as he wrote during the reign of 
Flruz who was greatly attached to the Emperor. While this is a 
forceful argument, it should be remembered that Barani has not 
hesitated to describe many harsh and oppressive acts of Muhammad 
bin Tughluq and severely condemn him. Later historians have sup¬ 
ported either the view of deliberate conspiracy and murder by 
Ulugh Khan, or accidental death by lightning as concluded from 
the statement of Barani. Badaunl and the authors of the Futuh-us - 
Salatin (an almost contemporary work), Am-i-Akban, and Tabaqat- 


57 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


i-Akbarl support the view of Ibn Batutah, while Firishta supports 
the view of Barani. But Firishta evidently was not quite convinced, 
for he concluded with the very characteristic expression, “God only 
knows the real truth”. The Tdrikh-i-Mubdrak Shdhi neither refers 
to the lightning, nor to the deliberate murder. 1 * 5 

Dr. Ishwari Prasad has critically discussed the question and is 
inclined to the view that Ulugh Khan murdered his father. 16 He 
points out that there were several causes of estrangement between 
the father and the son, the most important of which was Sultan’s 
aversion against Shaikh Nizam-ud-dln Auliya, to whom Ulugh Khan 
was devoutly attached. Further, when Tughluq was returning from 
his campaign he sent an order to the Shaikh to quit the city before 
his arrival. The Shaikh, when warned by his friends of the ap¬ 
proach of the Sultan almost to the suburbs of the city, is said to 
have replied: “Delhi is yet far off”. This may also be taken to 
indicate some sort of conspiracy to kill the Sultan before he could 
actually reach the capital city. But many writers are of opinion 
that even if there were any such conspiracy, Nizam-ud-dln Auliya 
had probably nothing to do with it. It is also very significant that 
the official, under whose supervision the pavilion was constructed, 
was not only not punished, but promoted to a higher post. Unless 
Shaikh Rukn-ud-din had deliberately made a false statement to Ibn 
Batutah, or the latter grossly misrepresented him, the circumstantial 
narrative of the former, who was present on the occasion, must 
be preferred to the vague statement of Barani. On the whole, 
though no definite conclusion is possible, one would perhaps be 
inclined to agree with Dr. Ishwari Prasad “that the Sultan’s death 
was the result of pre-meditation and conspiracy and not of accident.” 
This is also the view of Sir Wolseley Haig who observes: “Ibn 
Batutah’s impartial evidence is conclusive”. 17 Dr. M. Husain has 
made an attempt to exculpate Ulugh Khan, but his discussion, 
though elaborate and painstaking, 18 does not carry conviction, and 
appears more like a special pleading than an impartial investigation 
of truth. 

Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq died in A.D. 1325 (February or March), 
but during his short reign of less than five years he showed great 
ability in administration. The State treasury had been almost de¬ 
pleted by the reckless expenditure of Mubarak and Khusrav, and 
grant of jagirs on a large scale. The Sultan not only issued orders 
to resume the lands unlawfully granted, but also forced many to 
refund the amount that had been given to them. The celebrated 
saint, Shaikh Nizam-ud-dln Auliya, who had spent the money 
granted to him in charity, and was therefore unable to refund it, 


58 


GHIYAS-UD-DIN TUGHLUQ 


did not even send any reply to the Sultan’s demand. For this reason 
there was an estrangement between the two. The Sultan was very 
angry with his son Jauna for his extreme reverence for the saint, 
as has been noted above. 

The land revenue was equitably settled and the farming system 
was abolished. The Sultan took special care to prevent the exac¬ 
tions of peasants by officials and jagirdars and remitted revenues 
to a large extent in times of drought. On the whole the government 
was based on justice and moderation and inspired by a desire to 
promote the welfare of the ruled. The Sultan selected his officials 
on grounds of merit alone and paid them well to prevent corruption. 

The Sultan led an ideal life and was free from drinking and 
many other usual vices of the age. He built the fortified city of 
Tughluqabad and removed his capital there. He also erected many 
buildings, the most magnificent being his own tomb which has such 
unique artistic features. To him belongs the great credit of restor¬ 
ing the power and prestige of the Delhi Sultanate which had fallen 
very low, and revitalizing the system of administration which had 
almost collapsed during the disgraceful reigns of his immediate 
predecessors. 

But Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq, in spite of this admirable qualities 
and personal virtues, was a man of the age, and blindly adhered 
to the Quranic laws as the basis of his civil administration. This 
explains his attitude towards his Hindu subjects “who were treat¬ 
ed with great severity and were made to feel their position of in¬ 
feriority in the body politic”. 19 According to the ordinance pro¬ 
mulgated by the Sultan, “there should be left only so much to the 
Hindus that neither on the one hand should they become intoxicated 
on account of their wealth, nor on the other should they become 
so destitute as to leave their lands and cultivation in despair”. 20 
The close resemblance of this with the principles followed by ‘Ala- 
ud-din Khalji 21 is of great significance. As a man Tughluq was 
far superior to ‘Ala-ud-dln, but although he did not revive the 
agrarian and fiscal policy of the latter, his attitude towards the 
Hindus was not very dissimilar. This shows that the position of 
the Hindus in the Islamic State of Delhi did not depend much on 
the character and presonality of the Sultan, but was determined by 
the Quranic policy, as it was understood in this country in those 
days. This was clearly based upon discrimination between Muslims 
and Hindus, and the latter were relegated to an inferior position 
without any political status or civil rights in the land of their birth.

CHAPTER IV 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ (A.D. 1325-51) 

Three days after the death of his father, Ulugh Khan (also called 
Jauna) ascended the throne (February or March, 1325). He is 
designated variously as Muhammad Tughluq, Muhammad bin 
Tughluq, or simply Muhammad Shah. Following the existing prac¬ 
tice it would be convenient to refer to him as simply Muhammad or 
Muhammad Tughluq. Whatever view we might take regarding the 
part played by Muhammad in the tragic death of his father, there 
is no doubt that his accession was, generally speaking, accepted 
without demur by all concerned; in any event, there is nothing to 
show that there was any opposition or even popular discontent 
against the new ruler on that account. 

Of all the monarchs that ever sat on the throne of Delhi the 
personality and activities of Muhammad bin Tughluq have proved 
to be the greatest puzzle both in ancient and modern times, and 
have evoked the most lively discussion among historians of all ages. 
His reign was full of stirring events, some of which were strange, 
and even bizarre in the extreme. But, curiously enough, although 
we possess fairly detailed accounts of his reign written by three 
eminent contemporary authors, we do not know, not only the dates, 
but even the sequence, of these events. What is worse still, even 
in respect of the major schemes launched by the great Sultan, we 
cannot form any definite idea, either of their precise nature or of 
the motives that inspired them. There is, in consequence, a wide 
divergence of opinion among scholars regarding the proper recon¬ 
struction of the reign and a proper estimate of the character and 
personality of the monarch. It will be our endeavour to present 
a detached view of the Sultan and his reign with the help of such 
reliable evidence as we possess, without any attempt at hypothetical 
reconstruction based on speculation, but incidentally referring to 
the different views on controversial points as far as possible. 1 

One of the earliest events in the reign is the rebellion of Baha- 
ud-dln Gurshasp. 2 the son of Tughluq’s sister, who held the fief of 
Sagar, near Gulburga in the Deccan. He had amassed vast wealth 
and having gained over many of the nobles of his principality, at¬ 
tacked those who remained loyal to the Sultan (A.D. 1326-7). The 
imperial army defeated him at Devagiri and pursued him up to 
Sagar. But Gurshasp, unable to defend himself, fled with his family 


61 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


and treasure to the kingdom of Kampili, and sought shelter with 
its Hindu ruler. 

As noted above, 3 this small kingdom, comprising Bellary, 
Raichur and Dharwar districts, was originally a dependency of the 
Yadava kingdom of Devagiri, and when this was annexed by ‘Ala- 
ud-dln Khaljl, the ruler of Kampili declared his independence, and 
successfully resisted the invasion of Malik Kaffir (A.D. 1313-15). 
The kingdom had since grown in power and prestige, and now in¬ 
cluded parts of Anantapur, Chitaldrug and Shimoga districts. 4 
The Raja, called Kampilldeva in Muslim chronicles, welcomed the 
fugative Gurshasp and gave him protection. Whether he was actuated 
by purely humanitarian consideration and traditional Hindu ideas 
of hospitality, or there was any political motive behind it, it is 
difficult to say. The statement of Firishta that Gurshasp had 
maintained a friendly intercourse with the Raja of Kampili seems 
to support the latter view. The Raja of Kampili had been an avowed 
enemy of the Muslims, and might have some understanding with a 
chief disaffected towards the Sultan. 6 

But whatever might have been the motive of Kampilldeva, his 
action brought a veritable disaster upon him and his kingdom. As 
could be expected, the Sultan sent a powerful force against the 
defiant Hindu king. But Kampilldeva offered a heroic resistance. 
He twice defeated the imperial troops, but when fresh reinforce¬ 
ments arrived from Devagiri, he was forced to shut himself up in 
the fort of Hosadurg (Anagondi). It was invested by the enemy on 
all sides and lack of provision made it impossible for Kampilldeva 
to hold out for more than a month. But he died like a hero. On his 
advice the ladies of the royal family died by the fearful Jauhar 
ceremony and the wives of ministers and noblemen followed their 
example. Then Kampilldeva and his followers sallied forth and 
died fighting to the last. 6 Kampili was annexed and constituted into 
a separate province with Malik Muhammad as its governor. The 
surviving sons of the king and his officers were carried to Delhi as 
prisoners and were forced to embrace Islam, Among these were 
the two brothers, Harihara and Bukka, the founders of the kingdom 
of Vijayanagara. So the unique self-sacrifice of Kampilldeva for 
the sake of protecting a guest did not go in vain. From the ruins of 
his kingdom rose a mighty Hindu empire in the south, as will be 
related later. 

, When Kampilldeva found his situation helpless he managed to 
send the rebel Gurshasp with his family to the Hoysala court and 
commended him to the care and protection of King Ballala III. So, 
after the fall df Kampili, the imperial troops proceeded towards 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


Dvarasamudra, the Hoysala capital. Ballala III evidently took 
lesson from the fate of Kampilideva. According to Firishta he 
seized Gurshasp and sent him bound to the Muslim general, and 
at the same time acknowledged the supremacy of the Sultan of Delhi. 
But there are good grounds to believe that Firishta did not tell the 
whole truth. According to some authorities, Dvarasamudra was 
destroyed by the Muslims in A.D. 1327, and if so, it is very likely 
that Ballala III did not yield without fight. 7 Besides, an inscription, 
dated A.D. 1328, proves that Ballala III ruled as an independent king 
in that year, 8 and this is at variance with Firishta’s statement that 
he acknowledged the supremacy of Delhi. The probability is that 
Ballala III offered some resistance at first but, being defeated, made 
peace by surrendering the fugitive rebel Gurshasp. He evidently 
submitted to the Sultan, but was permitted to rule over at least a 
part of his kingdom. 

The rebellion of Gurshasp thus completed the expansion of 
the Delhi Sultanate to the southernmost limit of India. ‘Ala-ud-dln’s 
policy, like that of Samudra-gupta nearly a thousand years before, 
was merely to establish his suzerainty over the distant provinces 
of the south. He laid low the four great Hindu powers of the south, 
namely, the Kakatlyas, the Yadavas, the Hoysalas and the Pandyas, 
but was content to leave them in possession of their dominions so 
long as they acknowledged the suzerainty of Delhi. Though cir¬ 
cumstances forced him to annex the Yadava kingdom, he did not 
attempt to annex the other three kingdoms. The Tughluqs, however, 
pursued the policy of exterminating the Hindu rule in the south. 
Warangal and Madura had already been incorporated in their 
dominions and now Kampili and a large part of the Hoysala domi¬ 
nions shared the same fate. To Muhammad bin Tughluq, either as 
crown-prince, or as Sultan, belongs the credit of all these conquests 
which completed the triumph of Islam and seemed to have finally 
put an end to Hindu independence in the South. The authority of 
the Sultan was acknowledged all over India, save Kashmir, Orissa, 
Rajasthan and a strip of Malabar coast, and he established an effec¬ 
tive system of administration over this vast empire. It has been 
observed that even “the remote provinces like Malabar and Telin- 
gana were as effectively under his control as the villages in the 
vicinity of Delhi’.

. 

But the rebellion of Gurshasp, which brought into prominent 
relief the brighter side of Muhammad bin Tughluq, particularly his 
military abilities and the efficiency of administration, also displayed 
the darker side of his character. When Gurshasp was carried as 
prisoner to the Sultan, he ordered the rebel to be flayed alive. But 

63 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


he was not satisfied with this; Gurshasp’s flesh, cooked with rice, 
was sent to his wife and children, while his skin, stuffed with straw, 
was exhibited in the principal cities of the kingdom. This revolting 
cruelty gave a foretaste of the barbarous, if not fiendish, spirit which 
characterized the Sultan, and it was not long before he displayed 
it on a massive scale. 

One of the earliest administrative acts of the Sultan was the 
enhancement of taxation in the Doab (A.D. 1325-7). This created a 
terrible situation which throws a lurid light on the policy and cha¬ 
racter of the Sultan. The contemporary historian Barani gives a 
vivid picture of the whole affair which leaves on the minds of his 
reader a very deep impression of the atrocious regime of the Sultan. 
His account may be summed up as follows: 9 

“The taxation in the Doab was increased ten and twenty times, 
and the royal officials consequently created such abwabs or cesses 
and collected them with such rigour that the ryots were reduced to 
impotence, poverty and ruin. There were rebellions on all sides, 
the land was ruined, and cultivation was greatly diminished. All 
this produced a famine in Delhi and its neighbourhood and the Doab. 
Rains failed at the same time, and the famine continued for several 
years. Thousands of people perished, and when they tried to escape, 
the Sultan led punitive expeditions to various places and hunted 
them like wild beasts.” 

Barani is the only contemporary writer who refers to this 
painful episode, and paints it in vivid colours. His account leaves 
no doubt that the result of the policy of the Sultan and the method 
of its execution had created utmost distress and almost devastated 
large parts of the kingdom. It also brings into prominence the 
inhuman cruelty of the Sultan. But there are some grounds to 
doubt the accuracy of Baram’s version of the troubles in the Doab. 
He does not specify the exact amount of tax which was sought to 
be levied from the peasants, and the increment was not probably 
tenfold or twenty fold as he says. Firishta’s statement that it was 
increased threefold or fourfold is probably nearer the truth. 

Badaurii states that the enhancement of assessment was both a 
punitive measure and a means of replenishing the treasury, and 
this view has been accepted by Wolseley Haig. Gardner Brown 
thinks that the taxation imposed by the Sultan was not heavy, and 
that the picture drawn by Barani about the cruel deeds of the Sultan 
is highly exaggerated. Some other writers also seem to be inclined 
to this view. But even making due allowance for possible exaggera¬ 
tion, there is no doubt that there was widespread distress by the 
increased taxation and this was aggravated by famine. According 


64 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


to Gardner Brown, the sufferings of the people were more due 
to want of rain than to heavy taxation. But, then, no steps were 
taken to relieve the famine-stricken people, and there was no 
reduction in the taxation. The people who suffered severely natu¬ 
rally tried to escape from their homes to avoid the heavy taxes, 
and they were severely punished for this. The rendering of Barani’s 
expression that the Sultan ‘hunted men like wild beasts’ may be 
wrong, 10 or the statement may be exaggerated, but we may well 
believe that they were severely and mercilessly punished. On the 
whole it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the step taken by 
the Sultan was highly reprehensible, and the method of its execution, 
extremely cruel. They inflicted terrible hardships upon the people, 
devastated a fertile province, and created disorder and confusion 
over a wide area. 

The date of the increase of taxation is a matter of dispute, as 
different dates are given by older authorities. 11 Among modern 
scholars, some place the event in A.D. 1326-27, 12 while others place 
it three years later. Assuming this later date to be true, Dr. M. 
Husain has sought to give a new interpretation to the whole episode. 
He thinks that the rank of the cultivators was swelled by the dis¬ 
banded soldiers of the army recruited for expedition to Khurasan. 
When the tax was increased, they not only refused to pay the taxes 
but also ceased to work. This amounted to rebellion, since the 
peasants’ duty was to till the soil. Besides, they defied the tax- 
collectors and, as Haji-ud-Dablr informs us, even killed them. Hence 
the Sultan called the local Hindu chiefs to account and inflicted 
exemplary punishments on them. The amiran-i-sadah were then 
fitted out to crush the rebellion, but they were also killed by the 
rebels. Fearing the consequences, the ringleaders then fled into 
the forests, with which parts of the Doab were still covered; and 
when they fraternized with the hitherto independent Rajput clans 
of Dalmau, the Sultan pursued them over the whole area from 
Baran to Kanauj. 13 Dr. Husain’s reconstruction of the episode is 
highly speculative. But even if we adopt his view of the case, it 
is necessary to point out that the original fault lay with the Sultan, 
though he could not possibly foresee all the consequences. 

Dr. Husain refers to Haji-ud-Dabir’s statement in support of 
his theory of rebellion. But this writer clearly says that when the 
officers of the State employed rigour in collecting the taxes and 
practised oppression, the people rebelled in despair and abandoned 
their fields. 14 

About the same time when land tax was increased in the Doab, 
or perhaps a little earlier, the Sultan launched two big projects, 

65 

D.S,—5 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


namely, the change of the capital to Daulatabad (Devagiri or Deo- 
gir), and the introduction of a token currency. Both these require 
somewhat detailed consideration. 

For the transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (A.D. 
1326-27) and the ruthless manner in which it was done, we possess 
a detailed account from all the three contemporary authors, Baranl, 
Ibn Batutah, and ‘Isaml. The account of Baranl runs as follows: 

“The second project of Sultan Muhammad, which was ruinous 
to the capital of the empire, and distressing to the chief men of the 
country, was that of making Deoglr his capital, under the title of 
Daulatabad. This place held a central situation: Delhi, Gujarat. 
LakhanautI, Satganw, Sunarganw, Tilang, Ma‘bar, Dhursamundar, 
and Kampila were about equi-distant from thence, there being but 
a slight difference in the distances. Without any consultation; and 
without carefully looking into the advantages and disadvantages on 
every side, he brought ruin upon Delhi, that city which, for 170 or 
180 years, had grown in prosperity, and rivalled Baghdad and Cairo. 
The city with its sdrais, and its suburbs and villages, spread over 
four or five kos. All was destroyed. So complete was the ruin, 
that not a cat or a dog was left among the buildings of the city, in 
its palaces or in its suburbs. Troops of the natives, with their 
families and dependents, wives and children, men-servants and maid¬ 
servants, were forced to remove. The people, who for many years 
and for generations had been natives and inhabitants of the land, 
were broken-hearted. Many, from the toils of the long journey, 
perished on the road, and those who arrived at Deoglr could not en¬ 
dure the pain of exile. In despondency they pined to death. All 
around Deoglr, which is infidel land, there sprung up graveyards 
of Musulmans. The Sultan was bounteous in his liberality and 
favours to the emigrants, both on their journey and on their arrival; 
but they were tender, and they could not endure the exile and 
suffering. They laid down their heads in that heathen land, and 
of all the multitudes of emigrants, few only survived to return to 
their home. Thus this city, the envy of the cities of the inhabited 
world, was reduced to ruin”. 16 

Ibn Batutah refers to the same event as follows:— 

“One of the most serious reprehensions against the Sultan is 
that he forced the inhabitants of Delhi into exile. The cause of it 
was this. They used to write letters containing abuses and scandals, 
and they would seal the letters writing on the cover—‘By the head 
of His Majesty none except he should read the letter.’ These letters 
they used to throw into the council hall in the course of the night. 
When he tore them open, he found abuses and scandals in the con- 


66 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


tents. So he resolved to lay Delhi waste. He bought the houses 
and dwellings from all the inhabitants of Delhi and paid the price 
for them. Then he ordered the inhabitants to leave Delhi and 
move on to Daulatabad, but they refused to do so. Thereupon his 
crier went forth proclaiming that no one should remain in Delhi 
after three days. As a result, most of the people went away; but 
some concealed themselves in their houses. The Sultan ordered 
a search for those who still lingered; and in the lanes of the city 
his slaves lighted upon two men—one being a cripple and the other 
a blind man. Both were brought to the court and the Sultan order¬ 
ed the cripple to be thrown up in the air by means of the ballista 
(minjariiq) and the blind man to be dragged from Delhi to Daula¬ 
tabad—a distance of forty days’ journey. He was torn to pieces 
on the way, and only a leg of his reached Daulatabad. When the 
Sultan had done that, all the inhabitants of Delhi came out leaving 
behind their property and baggage, and the city was reduced to a 
desert. I was informed on reliable authority that in the night the 
Sultan mounted the roof of his palace and looked round Delhi. When 
neither a light nor even a smoke or a lamp came into sight he re¬ 
marked, ‘Now my heart is pleased and my soul is at rest’. Then he 
wrote to the inhabitants of other provinces to repair to Delhi to 
re-people it. As a result, those provinces were destroyed, but Delhi 
was not repeopled on account of its vastness and immensity. It is 
one of the greatest cities of the world, and when we entered it 
we found it in the state above referred to; it was empty and was 
but scantily inhabited”. 16 

In spite of the concurrent testimony of these two contemporary 
witnesses, with which the other contemporary, ‘Isaml, agrees, 17 it 
has been urged by some modern scholars that the account given 
by them is an exaggerated one. They argue that the statement that 
the city of Delhi was altogether deserted is in conflict with Ibn 
Batutah’s description of the city of Delhi as populous in the year 
A.D. 1334, i.e. three years before the restoration of Delhi as the 
capital city. This completely ignores the last three sentences of the 
extract quoted above from Ibn Batutah’s Rehla. Again, it is pointed 
out that constructive works were designed and carried out in Delhi 
by the Sultan during the very years in which he is supposed to 
have removed all the inhabitants of Delhi to Deogir. On these and 
other grounds Dr. M. Husain has made an elaborate and vigorous plea 
in defence of his contention that the city of Delhi never ceased to 
be the capital, and as such, was never depopulated or deserted. 18 
His arguments have been considered by Prof. N. B. Hoy whose con¬ 
clusion seems to be a more reasonable one. “The old capital,” he 
says, “was not, however, reduced to utter desolation; it continued 


67 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 

to remain a seat of administration and a mint-town, coins being 
issued from Delhi in 728, 729 and 730 A.H. (A.D. 1327-30). And dur¬ 
ing these years the royal palace too often buzzed with noise at the 
occasional visits of the Sultan required by the outbreak of rebellions. 
The city, however, wore a deserted appearance; and in spite of the 
Sultan's efforts to re-people it by bringing in men from other places, 
Ibn Batutah, ‘found it empty and depopulated’ save for a few in¬ 
habitants, when he visited Delhi six years after this event”. 19 

Thus although the city of Delhi might not have been absolutely 
depopulated and deserted, the story of the removal of the people 
en masse and the “incalculable magnitude of the suffering” caused 
thereby cannot be doubted. 20 

At the same time it is only fair to remember that the Sultan 
made various arrangements to alleviate the sufferings of the emi¬ 
grants. “The two distant cities were connected by a good road 
bordered with rows of trees to give shade to travelling men and 
beasts. Couriers who maintained an efficient service of carrying 
despatches by relays were set up at every coss, rest-houses and 
hospices were built at successive stages. Each was placed in charge 
of a Shaikh and provision was made for supplying food, cold drink 
and betels to the travelling multitude at these stations. These mea¬ 
sures undoubtedly offered partial relief from the pangs of thirst 
and hunger, but they could not protect the men from the scorching 
blaze of the tropical sun, nor could they assuage the home-sickness 
which ‘kills an Indian in exile.’ ” 21 

Some modern writers hold that the reason advanced by Ibn 
Batutah for the removal of the capital is unworthy of credence, and 
that given by Barani is also not perhaps quite accurate. They point 
out that the cessation of the invasion of the Mongols and the exten¬ 
sion of the Delhi Sultanate to the southernmost extremity of India 
diminished the importance of Delhi as the capital city and increased 
the necessity of having a centre of political activity in a more cen¬ 
tral place like Daulatabad. Dr. M. Husain is of the opinion that 
Sultan Muhammad probably decided to remove to Deogir on account 
of the paucity of Muslims in the Deccan and wanted to make 
Daulatabad a centre of Muslim culture, planting there a colony of 
Muslim saints, ‘itlama’ and nobles; and this view has been shared 
by others. 22 

According to the Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi there were two 
migrations to Daulatabad, one, of the notables, in A.D. 1327, and 
the other, of the inhabitants of Delhi as a punitive measure, about 
two years later. 23 Dr. M. Husain also holds that the transfer of 
the people to Deogir was effected in two stages, but he holds that 


68 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


only the leading Muslims, and not “the common people—the masses 
or the Hindus”—were forced to migrate there. He further asserts 
that “Delhi was never deserted and, in fact, never ceased to be 
the capital”. In his opinion Sultan Muhammad never intended to 
leave Delhi, much less to destroy it. What he wanted was to have 
two capitals for his far-flung empire, namely, Delhi and Daulatabad. 24 
But this view is not shared by others and is not supported even 
by the Tdrikh-i-Mubarak Shdhi to which Dr. Husain refers, for it 
distinctly speaks of a forcible mass migration and evacuation of 
Delhi about A.D. 1329, which was carried out so thoroughly that 
not even the cry of dogs or cats was heard in the city. 24a 

Shortly after the transfer of the capital the Sultan marched 
against the impregnable hill-fort of Simhagarh (then called 
Kondana), eight miles south of Poona. In spite of the heroic re¬ 
sistance of its Koli chieftain, the fort was besieged for eight months 
and practically starved into submission (A.D. 1327-28). 

This was followed by the rebellion of Bahram Aiba, surnamed 
Kishlu Khan, who was a close friend of Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq, and 
highly respected by Muhammad. As Kishlu held the fiefs of Uch, 
Sind and Multan which guarded the north-western frontier of the 
empire, his rebellion was a serious affair. Different causes of his 
rebellion are given by different authorities. The most probable 
view seems to be the refusal of the chief to send his family to the 
newly established capital Daulatabad and his quarrel with the mes¬ 
senger who brought to him the Sultan’s order to this effect. Kishlu 
gathered a large army, but was defeated by the Sultan who hurried¬ 
ly advanced from the Deccan with a large army (A.D. 1327-28). 
Kishlu fled, but was captured and executed. His head was hung 
up at the gate of the city as a warning to others. 

Troubles also broke out in Bengal, where Muhammad Tughluq 
had introduced a new system of administration. 2415 He had divided 
the province into three administrative units, with capitals respec¬ 
tively at Lakhnawatl, Sonar gaon, and Satgaon. He appointed Qadr 
Khan as joint ruler at Lakhnawatl with the Sultan Nasir-ud-din, 
whom Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq had left in independent charge of 
the province. Qadr, though nominally subordinate to Nasir-ud-din, 
was the de facto ruler, directly responsible to the Sultan of Delhi. 
Muhammad Tughluq introduced a similar policy of check and 
balance also in eastern Bengal. Ghiyas-ud-din Bahadur who, as 
mentioned above, was brought captive to Delhi by Ghiyas-ud-din 
Tughluq, was released by Muhammad Tughluq and was sent back to 
Sonargaon to rule jointly with Bahram Khan. A new governor was 
appointed for Satgaon. Nasir-ud-din, whose power was gradually 


09 



THE DELHI SULTANATE 


reduced to nullity, accepted the position without demur. But Ghiyas- 
ud-din, warned by the fate of his brother Nasir-ud-dln, rebelled 
after three years, in 728 A.H. (A.D. 1327-8). He was, however, 
defeated and captured by Bahrain Khan, who killed him, flayed his 
skin* and sent it to Muhammad Tughluq. 

The only exception to the brilliant military successes of the 
Sultan is furnished by his wars with the Rajputs and the invasion 
of the Mongols, and as opinions differ on both these episodes, they 
require a somewhat detailed treatment. According to the Rajput 
chronicles, Rana Hammira had taken advantage of the confusion 
in the Delhi Sultanate after the death of ‘Ala-ud-din Khalji to in¬ 
crease his power and seized Chitor in A.D. 1326. He gradually 
established his authority over the whole of Mewar and assumed the 
title of Maharana. The Chauhan ruler Jaiza, son of Maldev, who 
was ruling Mewar as a feudatory of the Sultan, fled to Muhammad 
Tughluq at Delhi. Thereupon the latter marched against the Maha¬ 
rana, but was defeated in a battle near the village of Singoli and 
was taken prisoner by the Maharana. Three months later, he was 
released by the Maharana after he ceded to him Ajmer, Ranthambor, 
Nagaur and Sooespur, paid 50 lakhs of rupees, and gave 100 
elephants. 

This circumstantial narrative is not directly corroborated by any 
other evidence, but according to a Jain temple inscription, dated A.D. 
1438, a Muslim army was defeated by Hammira. That Mewar 
acknowledged the suzerainty of Tughluq Shah is proved by an 
inscription in the fort of Chitor. So the Muslim-Rajput clash evi¬ 
dently took place in the reign of Muhammad. It is also quite clear 
from contemporary chronicles that Muhammad Tughluq and the later 
Sultans practically left Rajputana severely alone, and the various 
Rajput principalities recognised Mewar as the paramount power at 
least in name. The story of Hammira’s success against the Muslims 
cannot, therefore, be regarded as altogether baseless. We may 
accept the conclusion of Ojha that not only Mewar but nearly the 
whole of Rajputana became practically independent of Delhi Sulta¬ 
nate, but, as he rightly observes, the story of the defeat and impri¬ 
sonment of Muhammad Tughluq cannot be regarded as true in the 
absence of corroborative evidence. Possibly the Muslim army was 
led by some general and not the Sultan himself. 25 

Some time about A.D. 1327, India was invaded by the Mongols 
under the Chaghatai chief Tarmashirin (Dharmasri) of Transoxiana, 
who was a Buddhist but later converted to Islam. According to 
Firishta, Tarmashirin marched with a huge army towards India 
with a view to conquering it, and having subdued Lamghan, Multan 


70 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


and other regions, advanced rapidly towards Delhi. Sultan Muham¬ 
mad humiliated himself before him and purchased peace by giving 
the invader a huge quantity of wealth. On receiving almost the 
price of the kingdom, Tarmashirln retreated, after having plundered 
Gujarat and Sind and taking many prisoners. 

According to other, and earlier, accounts, the Sultan pursued 
the Mongols, after they had retreated, as far as Kalanor (in Gujarat 
district, Punjab), and though no actual engagement is mentioned, 
Tarmashirln is described as a vanquished enemy. But that the 
Mongols ravaged the territory almost up to the gates of Delhi, if 
not further to the east, and Muhammad could not oppose their ad¬ 
vance, seems to be the general view. This is clearly stated in the 
Tar l k h-i-Mub dr a k Shahi 26 and, curiously enough, is fully supported 
by a passage in the autobiography of Timur. We learn from this 
work that “Tarmashirln with a host beyond all number and com¬ 
pute had assailed Meerut”. 27 According to the Tarlkh-i-Mubarak 
Shahi, Muhammad Tughluq encamped in his capital and did not 
come out until the Mongols had turned back of their own accord 
after the devastation of the country. 28 

Dr. Ishwari Prasad accepts Firishta’s account as more probable 
than others, 29 but some modern historians do not accept this view. 
Sir Wolseley Haig accepts the story of the invasion, but rejects the 
account of the Sultan’s surrender and his attempt to bribe the 
invader. 30 Dr. M. Husain puts an entirely different construction 
on the whole episode. According to him Tarmashirln came to India 
as a refugee, because of the defeat he had suffered in A.D. 1326 at 
the hands of Amir Choban near Ghazni. He fled with a large part 
of his army into the Punjab and came through Multan to Delhi. 
The Sultan gave him 5,000 dinars by way of help, and he retired. 31 
This extremely speculative view is unsupported by any reliable testi¬ 
mony and opposed to almost all the evidence that we possess. 

The most remarkable experiment of the Sultan which took 
place shortly after this was the issue of his fictitious currency (A.D. 
1329-30). It is probable that he borrowed this idea from the paper 
currency prevalent in China and Persia. He issued brass or copper 
tokens 32 and also a decree to the effect that they should pass current 
for the silver tanka of 140 grains. There is no unanimity of opinion 
about the object or the wisdom of this policy. The contemporary 
historian Baram remarks that the Sultan’s bounty and munificence 
had caused a great deficiency in the treasury and he wanted large 
amount of money for his ambitious plan to conquer the whole world. 
So he introduced his copper money. Many later chroniclers hold 
the same view, and the policy has been severely condemned. But 


71 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


some modern writers are of opinion that the token currency was 
introduced not to refill the empty coffers but to remove the diffi¬ 
culty caused by the shortage in the world’s supply of silver and the 
consequent scarcity of the silver currency. They believe that the 
Sultan’s treasury was still quite rich, as is proved by Baranl’s own 
statement that the token coins were later exchanged at their face 
value. 

As regards the wisdom of the measure, Mr. Thomas held that 
the measure cannot be regarded as unjust, and Dr. M. Husain 
regards the scheme as “on the whole quite good and statesmanlike”; 
but others hold less favourable view. 33 There is however, unani¬ 
mity of opinion that the result of the introduction of token coins 
was most disastrous and that it was mainly due to the way in 
which the plan was executed. It should be noted that the ordinary 
gold and silver coins were also legal tender along with the token 
coins. The result was that the people paid their revenues in the 
token currency, and the foreign merchants paid for their expenses 
in the token currency, but refused to take them in payment for 
their goods. The evil results of this were increased hundred times 
by the fact that there was no special machinery to mark the dif¬ 
ference of the fabric of the royal mint and the handiwork of the 
moderately skilled artisans. Unlike the precautions taken to pre¬ 
vent imitation of the Chinese paper notes, there was practically no 
check on the unauthorized issue of the copper token and no limit 
to the power of production of the masses at large. The result of 
all this was almost the wholesale counterfeiting of the token coins, 
and Barani refers to it in his cryptic remark that the house of every 
Hindu was turned into a mint and every goldsmith struck copper 
coins in his workshop. Although the token coins were not current 
for more than three or four years, there was a very heavy loss to 
the treasury. But it must be said to the credit of the Sultan that 
he gave the public gold (and possibly also silver) coins in ex¬ 
change for the token copper coins. It is pointed out by contemporary 
chroniclers that mountains of these copper coins arose at the 
different treasuries of the government and lay there for years; the 
remains of them were to be seen even a century later. 

Shortly after the invasion of Tarmashirm, the Sultan formed the 
ambitious design of conquering Transoxiana, Khurasan and Iraq. 
With this object in view he began to raise a new army. Barani 
says that 3,70,000 troops were collected and paid for one year, but 
then the king disbanded them. According to Barani, this was one 
of the measures which diminished his treasury and brought distress 
upon his kingdom. Many have condemned the action of the Sultan 
and even denounced the project as a mad one. Some modern histo- 


72 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


rians, however, have taken a more lenient view. They are of the 
opinion that considering the power and prestige of the Sultan there 
was nothing inherently absurd in his plan of conquering neighbour¬ 
ing countries, particularly as the distracted political condition of 
Khurasan at that time appeared to be favourable to such an enter¬ 
prise. 34 But even admitting this point of view, one might wonder 
what good could be expected from such an expedition. While there 
was no reasonable prospect of permanently holding the distant land, 
there was the great risk that the army of invasion might suffer 
terrible loss in the steppe that separates India from that region. 35 
It is also admitted on all hands that at a time when the kingdom 
was suffering from the effects of the transfer of capital, token cur¬ 
rency, and rebellions, it was highly impolitic to undertake such an 
expedition. Besides, as events proved, the Sultan had very little 
knowledge about the real state of affairs in Khurasan. 

Although the Sultan abandoned the idea of conquering Khura¬ 
san, he did not give up altogether the idea of foreign conquests. 
A few years later, he conquered Nagarkot (A.D. 1337) in the Kangra 
district. Next he undertook an expedition in the Himalayan region, 
the object of which has been held by many, on the authority of 
Firishta, to be the conquest of China. But this view is not confirm¬ 
ed by any contemporary or any other later reliable authorities, and 
we must reject it. Both Baranl and Ibn Batutah state that the 
expedition was aimed against Qurachal mountain, which lies bet¬ 
ween India and China, and there is no doubt that this view is the 
correct one. The name of the State is written in various ways such 
as Qurachal, Qarajal and Farajal. Some later writers write it as 
Himachal. It has been suggested that the name Himachal and also 
the other names are derived from the Himalaya (mountains). Others 
hold that the name Qarachil is derived from Kumachal or Kurma- 
chal which is the name of Kumaon. But, whatever may be the 
correct form of the name, or its derivation, there is no doubt that 
the State was situated at the foot of the Himalayas, most probably 
in the region now comprised in the Kumaon Division, and extended 
up to the Terai. 36 

As regards the objects of the expedition, also, the authorities 
differ considerably. According to Baranl, it was a preliminary step 
to the conquest of Khurasan and Transoxiana, but this view may 
be rejected, as Kumaon does not lie on the way from India to those 
regions. The most probable reason seems to be that the Sultan 
wanted to extend the suzerainty of Delhi over the hill chiefs who 
gave him troubles and with whom Indian rebels, when defeated, 
found shelter. As a matter of fact, the expedition to Qarachal may 
be regarded as due to the same policy which led the Sultan to 


73 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


invade Nagarkot, namely, the security of the northern frontier. But 
whatever may be the object or ultimate destination, the expedition 
proved to be one of the greatest calamities. 

According to all accounts, the Sultan sent a large army for the 
expedition. Ibn Batutah says that it consisted of “a hundred thou¬ 
sand horsemen besides a large number of infantry”. It seems that 
the expedition passed through the Moradabad district. The royal 
troops captured the city of Jidya, which lay at the foot of the moun¬ 
tain, along with the adjacent territories, and burnt the country. 
The people here, all Hindus, left their hearth and home and took 
refuge in the mountain heights. There was only one road leading 
up to the hill-top and only a single horseman could pass through it. 
The royal troops climbed by this way and captured the city of 
Warangal. They wrote about their victory to the Sultan who or¬ 
dered them to remain there. 37 But when the rains set in, a disease 
broke out in the army. Accordingly, with the permission of the 
Sultan, the troops began to descend, but the people took their stand 
in the gorges and occupied the pass before them. Then they threw 
down pieces of huge trees which killed a large number of the 
Sultan’s army. Those who survived were captured and the people 
plundered the wealth, horses and the arms of the royal army. Only 
three officers of this army escaped, and the rest perished. This is 
the account left by Ibn Batutah, 38 and it is substantially corrobo¬ 
rated by other writers. The consequences of this ill-judged military 
expedition proved highly disastrous, and so seriously affected the 
military strength of the Sultan that he could never again collect a 
large force against his enemies. But, on the other hand, as the 
hill people could not cultivate the low lands at the foot of the hill 
without acknowledging the authority of the Sultan of Delhi, a 
peace was concluded with the mountain chief who agreed to pay 
tribute. Thus though the object of the expedition was partially 
fulfilled, it may be easily concluded that the military disaster was 
one of the primary causes of the revolts and disturbances that oc¬ 
curred almost throughout the empire. For, while the military re¬ 
sources of the empire were being exhausted in the expeditions 
against Nagarkot and Qarachal, the disintegration of the mighty 
empire had already begun in the south. 

Sayyid Ahsan Shah, the kotwal of Ma‘bar, the southernmost 
province of the empire with its headquarters in Madura, declared 
independence in A.D. 1334-5. According to Barani, 39 “the army 
sent from Delhi to recover Ma‘bar remained there.” This evidently 
means that it was won over by Ahsan Shah. The Sultan then per¬ 
sonally advanced against him via Daulatabad and Warangal. At 
the former place he levied heavy taxes and his oppressive exactions 


74 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


drove many persons to kill themselves. There was a cholera epi¬ 
demic at Warangal, and the Sultan himelf was attacked. In the 
meantime famine broke out in Delhi and Malwa, and there were 
rebellions in Lahore. So the Sultan gave up the campaign and re¬ 
turned to Delhi. Ma‘bar became independent and Ahsan Shah 
founded the Madura Sultanate. 

But far more serious was the rising of the Hindus in Telingana, 
Andhra and the territory to the south of the Krishna-Tungabhadra. 
Though the exact details are lacking, it appears that the organization 
of a sort of Hindu confederacy was attempted in the south in order 
to free the country from the yoke of the Muslims. This is quite 
natural and easily intelligible, for the first Muslim inroad into this 
region, which was more of the nature of a raid than of a conquest, 
took place during the reign of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khalji, barely a quarter 
of a century ago, and the destruction of the Kakatlya kingdom and 
the firm establishment of Muslim rule in the Deccan and South India 
were only a recent event barely five years old. The Muslim 
chronicles either ignore this movement among the Hindus or merely 
view it as one more rebellion against the Sultan. In any case 
their reference to it is brief and casual. This shows how much we 
are liable to misread or misinterpret Indian history so long as we 
have to derive our information from Muslim chronicles alone. 

Though the ruling houses and many noble families in the 
Deccan perished on account of the Muslim raids, some of the chief¬ 
tains who survived the catastrophe joined hands with the object of 
freeing their country from the Muslim yoke. According to con¬ 
temporary Hindu records, Prolaya Nay aka drew his sword against the 
Musulmans to re-establish the Hindu dharma, to restore the worship 
of the gods, and to protect the Brahmana and the cow. Prolaya pro¬ 
bably hailed from Musunuru in Paka-nadu in the southern Andhra 
country. He was supported by two other leaders, namely, Prolaya 
Verna, the founder of the Reddi kingdom of Addanki and Kondavldu, 
and Bhaktiraja, the Telugu Choda Prince of Eruva. People from 
all parts joined their standard, and under their inspiring leader¬ 
ship defeated the Muslims in a series of battles. As a result of 
these victories Prolaya Nayaka drove the Muslim garrison from the 
coastal districts of Andhra and established himself at Ekapalli in 
the Bhadrachalam taluk in the East Godavari district. 

Prolaya died between A.D. 1330 and 1335 and was succeeded 
by his nephew (brother’s son), Kapaya Nayaka, the Kanaya or 
Krishna Nayak of the Muslim historians. The successful rebellion 
of Ma‘bar at this time served both as an inspiration and opportunity 
to him. As already mentioned above, Muhammad Tughluq, advanc- 

75 

t 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ed up to Warangal in course of his campaign against the rebellious 
governor of Ma‘bar. He must have been aware of the Hindu re- 
surgence in this region and made a new arrangement for the adminis¬ 
tration of Tiling or Telingana. He divided it into two parts and 
placed the eastern division, with its capital at Warangal, under Malik 
Maqbul, a general of the old Kakatiya kingdom, called Nagaya 
Gauna, who had embraced Islam. As we shall see, he followed 
with success a similar policy in similar circumstances at Kampili, 
and no doubt hoped that a native of the locality, once holding a high 
office there, would be in a position to exercise great influence over 
the people. But the anticipated result did not follow in Telingana. 

Kapaya Nayaka was a shrewd statesman and could easily read 
the signs of the time. He was the leader of a confederacy of seventy- 
five chiefs, and in order to hasten the impending ruin of the Sultanate, 
he tried to organize a league of all the Hindu chiefs of the South. 
With this object in view he visited Vlra Ballala III, the powerful 
Hoysala king and the only independent Hindu ruler in the south. 
Ballala readily lent his support to the sacred cause. It was agreed 
that he should fortify a strategic place on the northern frontier of 
his kingdom and also send a body of troops to the help of Kapaya. 
The plan was eminently successful. Kapaya Nayaka, accompanied 
by the Hoysala troops, invaded Tiling and stirred up a Hindu rebel¬ 
lion. In the face of this national revolt, backed up by a regular 
army, Malik Maqbul found himself unable to protect Warangal. 
He fled from the province and the Andhra country was thus lost to 
the Sultan. Ballala III and Kapaya next invaded the northern 
districts of Ma‘bar, or the recently founded Sultanate of Madura. 
They expelled the Muslim from Tondaimandalam and handed it 
over to Venrumankondan Sambuvaraya who established himself at 
Kanchi. 

A similar national movement of the Hindus had also been 
working in the region along the Krishna under the leadership of 
Chaiukya Somadeva, the progenitor of the Aravidu family. He 
belonged to the Kurnool district and was probably supported by 
Prolaya Verna and other leaders of the similar movement on the 
eastern coast; indeed both may be regarded as part of one and the 
same movement. Somadeva is said to have captured a number of 
forts and won many battles. But his greatest achievement was his 
victory over Malik Muhammad who was appointed governor of 
Kampili after it was conquered by Muhammad Tughluq only a few 
years before, as noted above in connection with the rebellion of 
Gurshasp. That the victory over the governor of Kampili was the 
result of a national uprising of the Hindus is supported by the testi¬ 
mony of Nuniz. According to this Portuguese chronicler the people 


76 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


of .Kampill, who rose in rebellion against the Muslim governor, 
withheld the payment of taxes, surrounded him in his headquarters, 
and allowed no provisions to reach him. 

But here Muhammad Tughluq tried with success the method 
which failed him at Warangal. He appointed Harihara and Bukka 
who, as mentioned above, were taken prisoners from Kampill and 
forced to embrace Islam, as governor and deputy-governor of Kam- 
pili, and sent them with an army to restore order. They were 
opposed by Ballaia III who probably came to the support of Somes- 
vara. At first Harihara and Bukka were defeated, and perhaps 
they wandered about the country as refugees. It was during this 
period that they secured the help of the sage Vidyaranya, and 
thanks to his advice, ultimately succeeded in establishing them¬ 
selves at Anegundi on the northern bank of the Tungabhadra. 

The movement initiated by Somadeva with the support of Vira 
Ballaia III failed for the time being, but the resounding success of 
the Hindus under Kapaya Nayaka in the coastal region, mentioned 
above, gave fresh impetus to the people of Kampill. What is more 
important, even the Muslim governor of Kampill fell under the 
influence of the Hindu nationalist movement. Harihara and Bukka, 
under the inspiration of Vidyaranya, renounced Islam, took the 
lead of the new movement, and founded the kingdom of Vijaya- 
nagara in A.D. 1336 as will be related later. 40 

As noted above, Muhammad Tughluq had succeeded, by A.D. 
1328, in establishing his authority almost up to the southern ex¬ 
tremity of Indian Peninsula. But in less than ten years he lost the 
entire region to the south of the Krishna-Tungabhadra line, and 
even a part of Telingana and the coastal districts of Andhra. It 
marked the disintegration of the empire in a manner which no one 
could fail to notice. This was further signalized by the series of 
rebellions that took place about this time, in Lahore, Daulatabad, 
Sarsuti and Hansi. These were all put down, but as a result of the 
rebellion of Fakhr-ud-dln in Bengal, to which detailed reference 
will be made later, that province was lost to the Delhi Sultanate. 
Thus big cracks appeared in the mighty fabric of the Delhi Sultan¬ 
ate, and it was no longer a question of whether but when that great 
structure would fall. 

When the Sultan returned from Warangal to Delhi famine was 
raging in Delhi and its neighbourhood in a severe form, and men 
and cattle died in thousands. Even the Sultan felt it necessary to 
remove his family and court from Delhi to a newly founded town 
called Saragdwari (gate of heaven) on the Ganga near modern 
Shamsabad. But he had to deal with several rebellions, namely, 


77 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


those of Nizam Main at Kara, Nusrat Khan at Bidar, ‘All Shah at 
Gulburga, and ‘Ain-ul-Mulk in Awadh, which were all put down. 40a 

The Sultan personally marched against Shahu Afghan who had 
killed the governor of Multan and seized the city. The rebel fled, 
but on his return to Delhi the Sultan found the distress in the Doab 
unbearable. As the contemporary authorities tersely put it, “man 
was devouring man”. The Sultan tried to alleviate the sufferings, 
but with no success. He was soon faced with popular outbreaks in 
Sannam, Samana, Kaithal, and Kuhran. The Jat and Rajput tribes 
in this region in east Punjab formed mandals (strong-holds), with¬ 
held the tribute, and created disturbances. The situation was pro¬ 
bably similar to that in the Doab. 41 The Sultan sternly repressed 
the rebellions and took their ringleaders to Delhi. Barani says that 
many of them became Musulmans, which probably means that they 
were forced to embrace Islam. 

But these revolts were not the only causes which distracted the 
mind of the Sultan. He found to his dismay that his authority was 
defied even by Muslim divines,—the ‘ulama’, qdzts etc. Muhammad 
Tughluq put many of them ruthlessly to death. But such acts of 
cruelty shocked the rank and file of the Muslims and further estrang¬ 
ed them from the Sultan. He not unnaturally connected the rebel¬ 
lions with this feeling and decided to reinforce his authority by 
seeking recognition from the ‘Abbasid Caliph in Egypt. Baram’s 
account may be summed up as follows:— 

It occurred to the mind of the Sultan that no king could 
exercise regal power without confirmation by the Khalifa. So he 
sent despatches to Egypt while he was at Saragdwari. On return¬ 
ing to Delhi he had his own name and style removed from his coins 
and that of the Khalifa substituted. In the year 744 A.H. (A.D. 
1343-4) an envoy from Egypt brought to the Sultan honours and a 
robe from the Khalifa. The Sultan with all his nobles went forth 
to meet him and walked before him barefoot for some distance. 
From that date it was ordered that in mentioning the name of the 
king in the khutba they should be declared to have reigned under 
the authority and confirmation of the ‘Abbasid Khalifa. 42 

The motive attributed to Muhammad Tughluq by Barani may 
be correct, but there may be some truth in the view held by other 
early writers that the Sultan hoped that his receiving the patent 
from the Caliph would strike fear into the hearts of his enemies. 
But such anticipations were not fulfilled. 43 

The Sultan now turned to a new device to pacify the country. 
He introduced new economic and administrative measures which 
aimed at lessening the burden of taxes, development of agriculture, 


78 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


increased supervision of the administration of justice, and other 
laudable objects. 44 But though the plan was good, the method of 
execution rendered it ineffective. In order to ensure efficient work¬ 
ing of the new policy he dismissed the old officials and replaced them 
by new employees of humble birth. Barani calls them all upstarts 
and stigmatizes them as barber, cook, gardener, weaver, drunkards, 
rogues etc. 

The removal of a veteran official like Qutlugh Khan, Governor 
of Daulatabad, caused dismay and disgust among the people, and 
many of them broke into rebellion. 45 The appointment of ‘Aziz 
Himar 46 as governor of Malwa was another fatal step. Barani tells 
us that while investing the base-born ‘Aziz with this office the Sultan 
warned him against the amlran-i-sadah (centurions). 47 Most of them 
were turbulent, selfish and unscrupulous, and always ready to create 
chaos as friends of rebels and promoters of mischief. The Sultan 
told ‘Aziz that if he came to know that any of the centurions of 
Dhar was rebellious he must try to get rid of him in the best way 
he could. ‘Aziz carried out the instructions of his master to the 
letter. Shortly after his arrival at Dhar he beheaded eighty centu¬ 
rions in front of his palace on a got-up charge of rebellion. Accord¬ 
ing to Barani, the Sultan honoured ‘Aziz for the horrid massacre; 

i» 

but “this slaughter of the foreign amirs of Dhar on the mere 
ground of their being foreigners caused those of Deogir and 
Gujarat and every other place to unite and to break out into 
insurrection”. 48 

Indeed this was the beginning of the end. In A.D. 1345 the 
centurions of Gujarat revolted, and the Sultan proceeded against 
them via Patan and Mt. Abu. After a severe contest resulting in 
heavy casualties the rebels fled towards Daulatabad. The Naib 
Wazir pursued and dispersed them, but treacherously killed a large 
number of amirs of Broach under instruction of the Sultan. 

The Sultan encamped at Broach and sent orders to Deogir to 
send fifteen hundred horsemen with the most noted of the “foreign 
amirs 99 . These amirs accordingly started for Broach, but had not 
proceeded far when they suspected treachery and revolted. They 
returned, killed the officials, captured the treasury, and proclaimed 
one of them, Makh Afghan as king. They were joined by the 
centurions of Dabhoi and Baroda and established their authority 
over a large part of Maharashtra. 

The Sultan marched with a large army to Daulatabad and 
defeated the rebels who took to flight. He then besieged the fort 
of Daulatabad where Makh Afghan had shut himself up. But as 
there was a fresh rebellion in Gujarat led by Taghi, the Sultan left 
Daulatabad to punish him. He spent the remaining days of his 


79 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


life in vainly trying to suppress the rebellion of TaghI, and could 
not return to the Deccan. As a result of this, rebellion in the 
Deccan could not be checked and led to the foundation of an in¬ 
dependent kingdom in the Deccan known as the Bahmanl kingdom 
whose history will be treated in detail in another chapter. 

TaghI, supported by the muqaddams and the centurions of 
Gujarat, slew the governor and deputy-governor of Gujarat, plun¬ 
dered Cambay, and besieged the fort of Broach. It appears that 
TaghI had the sympathy and support of the people, both Hindu and 
Muslim, and his revolt was really a general outbreak of the people. 
When the Sultan arrived at Broach, TaghI avoided an open fight, 
and by brilliant guerilla tactics moved to Cambay, Aswal, and Patan. 
But being overtaken at Takalpur, and defeated by the Sultan after 
a severe engagement, he went to Tattah and sought shelter with the 
Sumras of Sind who had also broken out into rebellion. 

The Sultan spent some time in Gujarat, cleared it of rebels, and 
re-established peace and order. He then proceeded towards Tattah 
in pursuit of TaghI. He planned to attack the town by land and 
sea and crossed the Sindhu with his whole army, which was 
strengthened by four or five thousand Mongol horse sent by the 
chief of Ferghana. But on the way he contracted fever, and while 
the army was within a short distance of Tattah, he died on March 
20, 1351. 

Thus ended the career of one of the most remarkable personali¬ 
ties that ever sat on the throne of Delhi. He had extended the 
Delhi Empire to its farthest limits, but before his death he lost 
everything to the south of the Vindhya. Like the waves in the sea 
the empire reached the highest point only to break down. But 
though from this point of view the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq 
cannot claim great success, his unique personality and abnormal 
temperament invest it with great importance. 

No ruler in medieval India has evoked so much discussion 
concerning his policy and character as Muhammad Tughluq. Muslim 
chroniclers, without exception, describe him as a blood-thirsty 
tyrant and severely condemn his various measures. It has also been 
held by many modern historians, that he was a blood-thirsty tyrant 
almost verging on insanity, whose policy ruined the Sultanate of 
Delhi. In recent times, however, some reputed historians have 
challenged this almost universal belief of both scholars and laymen 
and sought to exonerate his character. The truth, as usual, perhaps 
lies midway between the two extremes, and Muhammad Tughluq’s 
character was probably a mixture of opposites. It must be admitted 
that he had many good qualities of head and heart, while his cruel- 


80 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


ties were shocking and horrid, and he showed a capricious temper 
and a sad lack of judgment and common sense on many occasions. 
We may, therefore, begin by a general description of both the good 
and bad qualities of Muhammad Tughluq. 

Muhammad Tughluq possessed in a remarkable degree some 
traits of character which distinguish a good king. He was active, 
energetic and hard-working, and unwearied in his efforts to super¬ 
vise the affairs of the State. He was a good general and often 
acquitted himself well in military campaigns. 

The Sultan had a very high moral character and was immune 
from most of the moral lapses which characterized the rulers of the 
middle age. He abstained from drinking and was very strict in his 
relation with women. He forbade the use of intoxicating liquor 
among his subjects and on several occasions issued orders that no 
woman should be permitted to remain in the military camp. But 
he was not a puritan like Aurangzeb and had no scruple to witness 
the performance of musicians and dancing girls. 

The lavish generosity of the Sultan has been described by 
both contemporary and later writers. Even Barani, who is the fore¬ 
most in casting aspersions on the character of the Sultan, refers to 
his liberal gifts and acts of hospitality. It is difficult to enumerate 
all the instances in which he made gifts on a lavish scale both to 
the nobles as well as to the learned and pious men who came from 
foreign countries. He discouraged begging and made provisions 
for the up-keep of poor, and forty thousand beggars were fed every 
day at the public kitchen. 

Although he is accused of killing his father, it seems that he 
tried to make amends for it by causing his father’s name to be in¬ 
scribed on the coins immediately after his accession. In any case, 
there is unanimity of opinion that he paid the highest respect and 
obedience to his mother and treated her most honourably through¬ 
out her life. The Sultan had also great respect for the elders, and 
always enjoyed the society of learned men. 

The Sultan was one of the most learned and accomplished men 
of his age. He was a patron of learning and his liberality attract¬ 
ed to Delhi some of the most learned men of India. He possessed 
a wonderful memory which enabled him to store a vast amount of 
knowledge on different subjects, particularly history. His intellec¬ 
tual attainments were very great and he possessed high scholar¬ 
ship in logic, astronomy, philosophy, mathematics and the physical 
sciences. He was not only well read in literary works but was 
himself a poet of no mean order. His letters, both in Arabic and 
Persian, were marked by a high degree of elegance, good taste, and 

81 


D.S.-8 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


good sense. His powers of conversation were also very great and, 
in debate, he could hold his own against the most eminent scientists 
and other people. He was also a great calligraphist. Above all, he 
acquired a good knowledge of medical science, and it is said that 
it was his favourite pastime to sit by the side of the patients, afflict¬ 
ed with any remarkable disease, in order to hold discussions with 
the physicians about proper diagnosis and suitable remedies for 
them. He established hospitals for the sick and alms-houses for 
widows and orphans, on the most liberal scale. 49 

He had also a high sense of justice and himself tried to judge 
cases in a fair manner. Ibn Batutah narrates several anecdotes in 
illustration of the Sultan’s modesty and justice. 50 Once an emi¬ 
nent Hindu filed a suit against the Sultan and had him summoned 
before the qdzi. The Emperor walked on foot, completely unarm¬ 
ed, to the qdzi’s court where he saluted and bowed. Previous to 
his departure he had issued orders to the qdzi instructing him that 
he must not stand or budge out of regard for him when he appear¬ 
ed in his court. Accordingly the Emperor attended the court and 
stood before the qdzi, who gave his verdict against him ordering him 
to compensate his opponent for the blood of his brother. The 
Emperor gave him satisfaction. 

. Against these good qualities and the versatile gifts and 
accomplishments of Muhammad Tughluq must be set his vices, the 
chief among which were cruelty and caprice. According to Barani 
the Sultan “wantonly shed the blood of innocent Muslims, so much 
so indeed that a stream of blood was always seen flowing before the 
threshold of the palace”. 61 Reference has already been made above 
to Baranl’s account of the Sultan’s inhuman treatment of the peasants 
of the Doab, whom he hunted like wild beasts over a large area. 
Almost all the other Muslim chroniclers also describe Muhammad 
Tughluq as a cruel monster, and several of them apply the epithet 
‘bloody’ to him. 62 Some modern writers have made an attempt to 
extenuate his crimes, and even the sober historian Ishwari Prasad 
has tried to explain away the charge of ‘habitual and wanton cruelty’ 
against the Sultan. 63 He holds that Muhammad Tughluq was not 
a monster who took delight in shedding blood for its own sake. He 
admits his cruelty, but points out that in the age in which he lived 
such cruel punishments were not regarded as abnormal. He is also 
of opinion that the Sultan was not essentially inhuman or wicked, 
but the hostile attitude of the people goaded him to desperation, so 
that he was compelled to have recourse to punishments and venge¬ 
ance as the only means of saving his kingdom from ruin. 


82 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


In judging this matter the opinion of Ibn Batutah seems to 
be quite decisive. He knew intimately not only the affairs of 
Muhammad Tughluq but also the customs prevalent in that age 
over a large part of the world. He was a keen observer of men 
and things and had no reason to be unduly severe against the Sultan. 
He said, by way of prefatory remark to his account, that he told the 
unvarnished truth in respect of things which he himself witnessed, 
and we have no reason to disbelieve it. In view of these there can 
be no better evidence of the cruel character of the Sultan than the 
severe denunciation made by this foreign traveller. He begins by 
making the following general observations: 

“Notwithstanding all his modesty, his sense of equity and 
justice, and his extraordinary liberality and kindness to the poor 
that we have described, he had immense daring (sic) to shed blood. 
His gate was hardly free from the corpse of a man who had been 
executed. And I used to see frequently a number of people killed 
at the gate of the royal palace and the corpses abandoned there. One 
day as I arrived there my horse was startled, and as I looked round 
I saw on the earth some white thing. ‘What is it?’ said I. One of 
my comrades replied, ‘It is the torso of a man who has been cut 
into three pieces’. 

“The Sultan used to punish all wrongs whether big or small 
and he would spare neither the men of learning (ahl-uWilm ) and 
probity ( salah ), nor those of high descent ( sharaf ). Every day hund¬ 
reds of people in chains with their hands fastened to the neck and 
their feet tightened were brought into the council hall. 

“Those who were to be killed were killed and those who were 
to be tortured were tortured and those who were to be beaten were 
beaten. . .May God save us from the calamity!” 64 

Ibn Batutah illustrates his general observations by citing a 
number of individual examples. 55 It would be tedious to relate 
them all, but in view of the differences of opinion on the subject, a 
few instances may be related. 

(1) The Sultan accused his brother of rebellion and the latter 
admitted his guilt, “for, as a rule, he who refuses to acknowledge 
a charge of this kind is tortured. Hence people preferred death to 
torture. The Sultan ordered that he should be beheaded and he 
was killed in the centre of the market. Two years previously his 
mother had been stoned to death in the same place on account of 
her confession of adultery”. 66 

(2) Shaikh Shihab-ud-dm, a pious and accomplished person, 
was one of the principal saints. As he declined to accept service 


83 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


under the Sultan, the latter ordered a venerable jurist to pull the 
hair of his beard and, on his refusal to do so, ordered that the beards 
of both of them should be pulled out, and this order was duly 
carried out. Several years later Shihab-ud-din, when approached 
by a Malik, said: “I will never serve a tyrant”. When the Sultan 
brought the Shaikh to him and said, “You say I am a tyrant”! “Yes”, 
retorted the Shaikh, “you are a tyrant and such and such are the 
instances of your tyranny.” Then he gave several examples amongst 
W'hich was the destruction of the city of Delhi and the expulsion of 
its inhabitants. For this offence they “tied him with four chains 
and fastened his hands and in this state he remained for a fortnight 
at a stretch without any food or drink”. But still he refused 
to recant what he said. On the fourteenth day, food was sent to him 
but he refused to take it, and then the Sultan ordered the Shaikh to 
be forcibly fed with human refuse. So they stretched him on his 
back, “opened his mouth with pincers and dropped into it the human 
refuse dissolved in water,” which they made him drink. 57 

(3) On one occasion the Sultan tortured two jurists of Sind 
for quite innocuous remarks. “They were stretched on their backs 
and a sheet of red-hot iron was placed on the chest of each. After 
a while the sheet was removed, and it came off together with the 
flesh of their chests. Then a little urine mixed with ashes was 
painted on their wounds.” After this they confessed their guilt 
and also wrote that their confession was voluntary. “Had they 
said that they had been forced in confessing, they would have been 
tortured to the utmost”. 58 

(4) On one occasion a young man and his brother-in-law, sus¬ 
pected of helping a rebellion, were ordered by the Sultan to be 
hung by their hands from a stake, and commanded some men to 
shoot them with arrows. They were consequently pierced with 
arrows till they died. After their death the Chamberlain remarked: 
“that youth did not deserve death”. For saying this the Sultan 
ordered the Chamberlain to be “whipped about two hundred lashes, 
threw him into prison, and gave off his property to the head execu¬ 
tioner”. 69 


In view of the fact that Ibn Batutah himself vouches for these 
punishments and treats them as if they were quite unusual and ab¬ 
normal, it is difficult to agree with the view of Ishwari Prasad 
mentioned above. It is also to be remembered that even the Sultan’s 
successor and great admirer Firuz was so much conscious of the 
excess committed by Muhammad Tughluq that he tried to atone 
for his sins by paying compensation to the successors of his victims 
and got a letter written by them that they were satisfied, so that 


84 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 


his soul might rest in peace in heaven. This proves that Firuz also 
regarded the cruelty as of abnormal nature. 

Reference may be made in this connection to the long conver¬ 
sation which the Sultan had with Barani in which he expounded 
what may be called his gospel of cruelty. An interesting sidelight 
on his character is thrown by his confession, in course of this con¬ 
versation, that he inflicted chastisement on mere suspicion or pre¬ 
sumption of the rebellious and treacherous designs of the people, 
and punished the most trifling act of contumacy with death; and 
then he added, “this I will do until I die, or until the people will 
act honestly and give up rebellion and contumacy”. 60 In view of 
this it is easy to understand the numerous cruel deeds of the Sultan 
and his approval of the mass execution of the amiran-i-sadah in 
Malwa. 

Next to cruelty the chief blots on the character of Muhammad 
Tughluq were his unpractical visionary ideas backed by caprice and 
tyranny. The idea of changing the capital from Delhi to Deogir, 
the issue of token currency, and the ambitious military expeditions 
to Khurasan, are generally regarded as due to his capricious tem¬ 
perament. As has been pointed out above, some modern historians 
have tried to show that none of these projects was inherently bad 
in itself, but the failure of each was due to lack of foresight and 
practical experience. But even these are great defects in the 
character of a king, and considering the amount of misery they 
entailed upon the people and the kingdom, the king cannot be al¬ 
together exonerated of the charges of caprice levelled against him, 
particularly when we remember that all these projects were pro¬ 
ducts of his own brain and he did not take into confidence or con¬ 
sult any of his advisers. The only redeeming feature is that he 
did not push any of these schemes to extremities, and desisted as 
soon as their bad effects were apparent to him. 

Muhammad bin Tughluq has been charged with irreligiousness 
by his contemporaries, but this is hardly a just accusation. In what 
is regarded by some as his own Memoirs he “acknowledges his faith 
in the existence of God, in the Prophet, and his Viceregent, the 
rightful Imam”. 61 This is also supported by the evidence of his 
coins. “His staunch orthodoxy is reflected on nearly all his coins, 
not only in the reappearance of the Kalima, but in the assumption by 
the monarch of such titles as “the warrior in the cause of God”. 62 
Firishta also praises his orthodoxy. 63 

A clear analysis of the known facts indicates that while the 
Sultan scrupulously practised all the observances of the Muslim 
faith, he did not show the same respect for the Muslim divines as 


85 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


was shown by the orthodox Muslims. This, however, is due to the 
fact that he was very keen on supporting the rationalists (ahl-i- 
ma’qulat) against the traditionists (ahl-i-manqulat) , 64 His liberal 
spirit is further indicated by a Jain tradition which tells us that 
the Sultan honoured the great Jain scholar and saint, Jinaprabha 
Siiri, who visited his court at Delhi in A.D. 1328. Muhammad bin 
Tughluq “treated him with respect, seated him by his side, and 
offered to give him wealth, land, horses, elephants etc. which the 
saint declined. The Sultan praised him and issued a jarman with 
royal seal for the construction of a new basadi updsraya, i.e. rest 
house for the monks. A procession started in his honour to his 
residence to the accompaniment of varied music and dances of young 
women, and the saint was seated on the State elephant surrounded 
by Maliks”. 66 In view of the bigotry shown by most of the rulers 
of the period, all this reflects great credit upon Muhammad Tughluq 
and testifies to his liberal and rational mentality. So, from the 
modern point of view it should be regarded as a great merit in the 
character of the Sultan that he could rise above the rank bigotry of 
his age and, without succumbing to a blind and superstitious reve¬ 
rence for anything that passed in the name of religion, allowed 
himself to be guided by a rational spirit. On the whole, the 
charge of heterodoxy levelled against Muhammad is not true, and 
in this respect he deserves more praise than blame. 

<~f*fy ’ 

Both Barani and Tsaml denounce Muhammad Tughluq as irre¬ 
ligious. TsamI calls him a kafir and urges a general revolt against 
him. He censures him for siding with the Hindus and mixing pri¬ 
vately with the yogis. 66 “It has been contended that the Sultan 
had the audacity to employ and treat the ‘ulama’ and saints like 
ordinary men and he was therefore a blasphemer”. 67 As a matter 
of fact the high classes of Muslims, including official classes, the 
‘alama’, the qazis or judges, the khatibs or preachers, faqhis or jurists, 
and the viashaikhs or saints, a body of people who had hitherto en¬ 
joyed sanctity, were the ringleaders of the Muslim rebellions 
against the Sultan. 68 “Muhammad Tughluq put them ruthlessly 
to death—a practice which horrified the rank and file of the Mus¬ 
lims”. 69 But this crime, great as it was, was the result, more of 
his cruel temperament than of irreligion; and his whole attitude 
to the Muslim saints was due to caprice or egoism, which was a 
distinctive trait in his character, rather than an act of blasphemy. 
Thus although we may not pronounce Muhammad Tughluq as lack¬ 
ing in orthdox religious spirit, his general attitude towards the 
Muslim divines and particularly the severe punishments he inflicted 
upon them, must be regarded as a serious blemish in his character. 


86 


MUHAMMAD BIN TUGHLUQ 

It is generally held that Muhammad’s policy and action were 
responsible for the break-up of the Delhi Empire. This is undoubt¬ 
edly true to a large extent. It may be urged that disintegration 
of a vast all-India empire was not unusual, and almost inevitable 
in those days of lack of communication and absence of any real 
bond of union between the distant parts of the empire. Other em¬ 
pires like those of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl also crumbled into ruins with¬ 
in a few years. It is also pointed out that FIruz Tughluq left the 
Delhi Sultanate much worse than he found it. All this is no doubt 
true to a certain extent. But even the inevitable collapse of an 
empire has generally to be attributed to certain immediate causes, 
and Muhammad Tughluq’s policy, which alienated the minds of the 
people and created disaffection throughout the kingdom, must be 
regarded as one of the predisposing causes. 

It would appear from what has been said above that although 
the current view about Muhammad Tughluq may not be true to 
the whole extent, the attempts of some recent historians to exone¬ 
rate him from all blemishes have not proved successful. He was 
not a monster or a lunatic, as has been suggested by some, but there 
is no doubt that he was a mixture of opposites, for his many good 
qualities of head and heart seem to be quite incompatible with cer¬ 
tain traits of vices in his character, such as revolting cruelty, frivol¬ 
ous caprice, and an inordinate belief in his own view of things. 
He might have had good ideas, but he had not the capacity to exe¬ 
cute them. This was best exemplified in his ambitious projects 
like change of capitals, issue of token currency and foreign expe¬ 
ditions, and the appointment of new classes of officials. All these 
indicate a want of judgment which is undoubtedly a great defect 
in the character of a ruler, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion 
that his character and policy largely contributed to the decline of 
the Delhi Empire.

modern writers hold different views on this point. The chronological scheme of 
Dr. Ishwari Prasad has generally been followed in this chapter. Sir Wolseley 
Haig has drawn up a tentative chronology (JR,AS, 1922, pp. 336 ff). S. N. H. 
Rizvi also has made an attempt to fix the chronology on the authority of Futuh- 
us-Salatln, as he believes that the events are narrated in this work “in perfect 
chronological order” (PIHC, V, 302). But these views have not been accepted 
by scholars.

17. An English translation of Tsami’s account is given in JIH, XX, 172. The story 
of the cripple and the blind—the most incredible part of Ibn Batutah’s account— 
is in a way supported by TsamI, who “feelingly describes how his grandfather, 
an old, man of ninety, was turned out. One morning while still in bed, he was 
seized, thrown out of his home, and set on the road to Daulatabad. But he died 
shortly after” (MTMH, 122). For a fuller discussion of the different views about 
the transfer of the capital cf. MTMH, 108 ff, QTIP, 82 ff; JIH, XX, 159 ff.

32. According to BaranI the tokens were of copper, while Firishta alone refers to 
both copper and brass coins. As brass coins have actually been found, the latter 
view seems to be correct. 

33. MTMH , 134. For a favourable view of the token currency and a full reference 
to other views, cf. Dr. Ishwari Prasad’s elaborate discussion in QTIP, 101 ff. He 
holds the view that the “scheme failed more on account of prejudice, ignorance 
and lack of proper safeguards than on account of any inherent defect” (p. 117). 
But while there is a great deal of force in the arguments of Thomas and Ishwari 
Prasad, it must be remembered that a novel experiment of this kind should not 
be judged from merely theoretical point of view, and one who cannot properly 
judge of the fitness or ripeness of the time for it, or provide for, and even think 
of adequate precautions to ensure its success, fully deserves condemnation.

has been practically ignored by both ancient and modern writers. The Muslim 
chroniclers make only casual references to isolated events which do not convey 
any idea of the general movement and are full of errors. Hardly any notice is 
taken of it in CHI, III and MTMH. The account in QTIP is also very meagre 
and misleading. The account given in the text is based upon the following:

of individual efforts by the chieftains of the time, and not of a planned and 
co-ordinated movement directed by Musunuri Kapaya Nayaka (ibid. 297).

the addition of a single dot changes the one into the other word, probably

berate pleasantry”. (CHI, III, 166 f.n.). 

47. Sultan Muhammad had divided the southern provinces into small units of 
hundred or more villages to which officers were appointed who were directly 
under the governor. These officers were known as amiran-i-sadah, i.e. officers 
of hundreds. These centurions had to carry out both military and civil duties. 
As civil officers they were responsible for the collection of revenue and other 
dues of the territory under their jurisdiction, and their position as military 
officers gave them the necessary strength to carry out their civil duties. This 
system continued till about A.D. 1345, when Muhammad Tughluq, finding that 
it could not successfully check rebellious elements, modified it to ensure stable 
administration. He sub-divided the province of Deccan into four parts or shiqs 
to each of which he appointed an officer subordinate to the wazir at Daulatabad. 
The avvirdn-i-sad.ah or centurions in each of these sub-divisions were now im¬ 
mediately responsible to the shiqdar of their sub-division and through him to the 
governor of the province. But this reform came too late.

CHAPTER V 


FIRUZ SHAH 

The death of Muhammad bin Tughluq, during the course of a 
military campaign, created a perilous situation, and the disorderly 
retreat of the leaderless army led to chaos and wild confusion. 
Taking advantage of this, not only the rebels in Sind but also the 
Mongol mercenaries, who had come to assist the Sultan’s army, 
plundered the imperial camp without any opposition. After suffer- 
ing this disgrace and humiliation for two days, the officers and 
nobles present in the camp offered the vacant throne to Firuz, whose 
father Rajab was the younger brother of Ghiyas-ud-dm Tughluq, 
and who was thus the first cousin of the late Sultan. Firuz, at first 
unwilling to accept the offer, ultimately yielded to the pressure 
of the nobles and was hailed as the Emperor on March 23, 1351. 

Apart from the immediate necessity of a leader to save the 
difficult situation in which the imperial army was placed, the choice 
of the nobles was probably determined by the fact, or at least a 
general belief, that Muhammad Tughluq, having no son, had nomi¬ 
nated Firuz as his successor. A protest was made by Khudavand- 
zada, the sister of Muhammad Tughluq, on behalf of her son, who 
was more closely related to the late Sultan, but the nobles rejected 
his claim on the ground that he was incompetent and incapable of 
governing. 

As soon as the news of Sultan Muhammad’s death reached Delhi, 
the minister, Khvaja Jahan, raised to the throne a child, whom he 
gave out as the son and heir of the late ruler. Some modern histo¬ 
rians are of opinion that the infant enthroned at Delhi was the real 
son of Sultan Muhammad, and disbelieve the story that the latter, 
on his death-bed, declared Firuz as his heir. They hold that possibly 
Sultan Muhammad bequeathed to Firuz the regency, and exhorted 
him to do all in his power to extricate the army from its dangerous 
situation. 1 But almost all the contemporary and non-contemporary 
writers, including Sujan Rai Bhandari, the author of the Khulasat-ut- 
Tavarikh, are in accord that the late Sultan had left no male issue, 
and this is also indirectly proved by the claim put forward by Khuda- 
vand-zada on behalf of her son. Both the contemporary authorities, 
Baranl and ‘Afif, refer to the nomination of Firuz as his heir-apparent 
by Muhammad Tughluq. In view of all these if is reasonable to 


90 


FiRtrZ SHAH 


hold that Firuz was justified in accepting the throne when it was 
offered to him in the Sindhu valley. In any case the real or pre¬ 
tended son of Muhammad Tughluq was not supported by any 
party, and Khvaja Jahan submitted to the new Sultan, who at first 
pardoned him, but soon changed his mind and had him executed. 

After having driven off the enemy in Sind, Firuz proceeded 
on his journey to Delhi. On reaching Sirsuti he heard the happy 
news of the death of TaghI, the rebel who had defied Muhammad 
Tughluq and had tired him to death. The royal journey was then 
resumed, and on reaching Delhi the coronation was celebrated in 
the month of August, 1351. It was followed by new distribution 
of offices, remission of oppressive taxes, and the cancellation of 
punitive measures and sanguinary punishments of the previous 
regime. Towards the close of A.D. 1353 Firuz set out on an expe¬ 
dition to Bengal for putting down its ruler Haji Ilyas Shah, who 
had assumed independence and styled himself Sultan Shams-ud- 
din Ilyas Shah. As the Sultan approached, the rebel withdrew 
into the strong fortress of Ekdala in East Bengal, protected by 
rivers and jungles. After a short siege the Sultan feigned retreat, 
and Ilyas pursued him with a big force. But he was defeated and 
fell back. Ekdala, however, held out, and as the rainy season was 
then fast approaching, the Sultan made peace with Ilyas, practi¬ 
cally recognizing his independence, and returned to the capital in 
A.D. 1355. 2 In that year he built the city of Firuzabad on the bank 
of the Yamuna, which became known as New Delhi. 

In A.D. 1356 a robe of honour arrived for the Sultan from the 
Caliph Al-Hakim of Egypt with a patent conferring on him the 
whole of Hindusthan. Towards the close of this year there came 
messengers from Haji Ilyas of Lakhnawati with splendid presents 
and gifts. Through the Bengali messengers who had come to Delhi 
(1357), the Sultan despatched steeds with foreign fruits to Shams- 
ud-din of Lakhnawati, and sent an embassy. But it was learnt 
shortly after that Sultan Shams-ud-dm had died and was succeeded 
by his son Sultan Sikandar. So the embassy was recalled. But the 
Sultan’s action showed that he formally acknowledged the independ¬ 
ence of Bengal. 

Nevertheless the Sultan resolved to lead a second expedition 
to Bengal. Zafar Khan, the son-in-law of Fakhr-ud-din, the inde¬ 
pendent ruler of Bengal, had come as a fugitive to the camp of the 
Sultan, and complained of the high-handedness of Shams-ud-dm 
Ilyas. He begged the Sultan to intercede on his behalf, and the latter 
took advantage of it to make a renewed attempt to subdue Bengal.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


‘Afif’s Tarikli-i-Firuz Shahi, which contains a detailed account 
of Firuz Shah’s campaign, tends to show that this expedition was 
undertaken and carried through more like a pleasure trip than a 
regular march to extirpate and crush the enemy. The Sultan had 
proceeded a few stages from Delhi when he began to indulge in 
wine, and loitered six months in the tract between Kanauj and 
Awadh to found a new city on the Gumti, which was named Jaun- 
pur, apparently to commemorate the memory of Muhammad Tugh- 
luq, whose name was Jauna. After a long delay the Sultan at last 
reached Bengal in A.D. 1359. Sultan Sikandar, like his father, 
shut himself up in the fortress of Ekdala. Flruz besieged it, but his 
operations were marked by indecision and lack of military skill. 
According to ‘Afif, the Sultan would not give the orders for attack 
on the enemy, even when urged by the best of his generals, saying, 
“although it was very desirable that the place should be captured, 
still if it were taken by a sudden assault, thousands of worthy and 
respectable women would be subjected to violence and indignity 
at the hands of the graceless men.” But others hold the view that the 
Sultan found the fortress too strong for capture and hence restrained 
his men from attempting to take it by assault. The deadlock 
sickened both the parties who thereupon made overtures for peace. 
Peace was concluded, according to ‘Afif, on condition that Zafar 
Khan should be established in Sonargaon. But this seems to be 
very unlikely. According to other historians, Sikandar promised 
only to send an annual tribute of elephants to the Emperor. ‘Afif 
says that Sikandar was awarded a royal title in return, besides a 
jewelled crown worth 80,000 tankas and 500 Arab and Turki horses. 
On the whole, Firuz failed to recover Bengal as a part of the Delhi 
Sultanate. 

The Sultan had reached Jaunpur on his way back to Delhi from 
Bengal, when he suddenly conceived the plan of making a raid 
upon Orissa, referred to as Jlajnagar by Muslim chroniclers. 3 He set 
out in October, 1360, with a large cavalry and reached Bihar about 
December, 1360. Then he marched through modern Pachet to 
Sikhar in the Manbhum district. The ruler of this place was an 
important chief with thirty-six minor chiefs as his vassals. He 
fled, but the garrison in the capital put up a stern fight before they 
were overpowered. Then Firuz pushed towards the south through 
the defiles of Manbhum and Singhbhum till he reached Tinanagar 
within the frontier of Orissa, which had never before been invaded 
by any Muslim army. The people offered resistance, but were de¬ 
feated, and then Firuz proceeded to a prosperous town named 
Kinianagar, which is probably to be identified with Khiching, the 
capital of the old Mayurbhanj State. Then marching through 


92 


FiRUZ SHAH 


Keonjhar, the Sultan reached the frontier of the Cuttack district. 
The movement was so swift, that King Bhanudeva III of Orissa, 
being taken by surprise, fled from the fortress of Saranghar. The 
garrison, however, put up a brave fight, but were defeated. Firuz 
then marched to the capital city Cuttack, and later proceeded to the 
holy city of Puri, where he demolished the temple of Jagannatha 
and desecrated the images. 

After having achieved this cherished object, the Sultan pro¬ 
ceeded to an island near the sea-coast where “nearly one hundred 
thousand men of Jajnagar had taken refuge with their women, child¬ 
ren, kinsmen and relations”. The locality no doubt refers to the 
region round the Chilka Lake. The Sultan converted “the island 
into a basin of blood by the massacre of the unbelievers”. Those 
who survived the massacre, particularly women, were “pressed as 
slaves into service in the house of every soldier”. “Women with 
babies and pregnant ladies were haltered, manacled, fettered and 
enchained, and no vestige of the infidels was left except their blood”. 
After this the “jubilant” Sultan concluded his victorious campaign 
by an elephant-hunt at Padamtala (in the old Baramba State of 
Orissa). 4 

According to ‘Aflf, the Raja of Orissa sent envoys to the Sultan 
offering submission. The Sultan assured the Raja of his friendly 
intentions and the latter “agreed to furnish certain elephants yearly 
in payment of revenue”. This satisfied the Sultan “who sent robes 
and insignia to the Ray.” 6 

‘Afif gives a detailed account of the return journey of the army, 
on the authority of his father, who accompanied it. The guides lost 
their way and the army, passing through unknown hills and jungles, 
for six months, “were quite in despair and utterly worn out with 
the fatigues of the arduous march”. To make matters worse, “provi¬ 
sion became very scarce, and the army was reduced to the verge 
of destruction”. 6 

According to a recent writer, “it was an audacious campaign, 
brilliantly conceived and mightily executed”, and “the successful 
execution of this campaign testifies to Firuz’s undoubted skill as a 
general”. 7 The campaign was certainly audacious, but the above 
description of the return journey leaves the impression that it was 
neither planned nor executed in a manner worthy of a skilful 
general. 

This brings us to another important question, namely, the object 
of the expedition. That it was an afterthought and due to a sudden 
impulse is clearly proved by the fact that the Sultan had to retrace 
his steps to Bihar. Evidently the idea of such an expedition was 

93 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


formed only after he had reached Jaunpur, or at least not long be¬ 
fore it. Fortunately, the two contemporary official sources which 
supply the details of the expedition also mention the objects for 
which it was undertaken. According to the Siral-i-Firuz Shdhi , 
these were: “extirpating Rai Gajpat, massacring the unbelievers, 
demolishing their temples, hunting elephants, and getting a glimpse 
of their enchanting country.” 8 ‘Ain-ul-Mulk echoes the same senti¬ 
ment. “The object of the expedition was,” says he, “to break the 
idols, to shed the blood of the enemies of Islam (and) to hunt 
elephants.” 9 Referring to this a modern writer has observed that 
“Firuz Shah’s main purpose was elephant-hunting, though hedged 
round by other reasons....” 10 It is dificult to accept this view. 
Apart from the commonsense view that a sober ruler is hardly likely 
to undertake such a risky expedition through unknown hills and 
jungles to a distant land, merely, or even mainly, for elephant- 
hunting, the spirit of bigotry which characterized the Sultan hardly 
leaves any doubt that the main object of the Sultan was, as expressly 
stated by both the contemporary authorities, the destruction of the 
holy temple of Jagannatha at Puri, held with the greatest venera¬ 
tion all over India. It bears some analogy to the expedition of 
Sultan Mahmud to Somanatha, and, curiously enough the analogy 
extends to the sufferings during the return journeys of both. The 
argument advanced in support of the view that the elephant-hunt¬ 
ing was the only object of the expedition is that the Sultan “broke 
no idol, pillaged no shrine”. 11 It is even said that he went to Puri 
to view and admire the famous temple of Jagannatha and if he 
carried the idol, perhaps he wanted it for his museum. 12 

This ingenious and somewhat puerile attempt to whitewash 
the conduct of Firuz is rendered futile by the clear statement in 
the Sirat-i-Firuz Shdhi that the temple of Jagannatha was destroyed 
and the images deliberately desecrated. 13 The terms of the treaty 
with the ruler of Orissa do not indicate that the conquest of the 
country was the main objective of the Sultan. On the whole, it is 
difficult to avoid the conclusion that Sultan Firuz was animated by 
the spirit of Sultan Mahmud, and the destruction of the temple of 
Jagannatha and the chastisement of the Hindus were his main ob¬ 
jects. The subjugation of Orissa and the elephant-hunting were at 
best subsidiary issues. It is exceedingly probable that on his way 
back from Bengal the Sultan heard of the great sanctity of the 
temple of Jagannatha at Puri, and decided to destroy this citadel of 
infidels. This satisfactorily explains his sudden decision to lead a 
campaign against Orissa. 

In 1361, Firuz proceeded to Sirhind with the object of invading 
Nagarkot (Kangra), which was conquered by Muhammad Tughluq, 


94 


FIRUZ SHAH 


but whose ruler had since asserted independence. The sanctity of 
the temple of Jvalamukhl in Nagarkot, which attracted thousands 
of Hindu pilgrims, was probably an additional reason for this expe¬ 
dition. 14 His march to Sirhind w T as leisurely, and in the course of 
it he stopped to construct a canal and a fort. Afterwards he resumed 
his march towards Kangra, whose chief submitted and was allowed 
to keep his territory as a fief. Next year FIruz undertook an expe¬ 
dition against Sind. If we remember the tragic circumstances amid 
which Muhammad Tughluq’s campaign in that region ended in A.D. 
1351, we need hardly wonder that FIruz should have undertaken a 
fresh one to vindicate the imperial prestige. Indeed, from this point 
of view it seems to have been long overdue. Apart from the desire 
of new conquest, recovering the lost prestige, and avenging the 
wrongs done to the late Sultan by the chiefs of Sind—the motives 
mentioned by ‘Aflf—the turbulent activities of those chiefs for years, 
engendered by a hostile and rebellious spirit, furnished a clear 
excuse for the Sind campaign. 16 

FIruz set out with a large army of 90,000 horse and 480 
elephants. He collected a large fleet of boats on the Sindhu and 
besieged Tattah, the capital of the Jams of Sind. The ruler, Jam 
Banhbina, 16 bravely defended the city and made frequent sorties. 
The Sultan’s army suffered from famine, and a pestilence carried 
off nearly three-fourths of the horses. To make matters worse, the 
royal fleet fell into the hands of the enemy. Thereupon the Sultan 
decided to withdraw, and marched with his troops towards Gujarat. 
The retreat is said to have been more calamitous than the siege. 
Many died for want of the necessaries of life, and the obnoxious 
disease among the horses continued in all its fury. Treacherous 
guides misled the army into the Rann of Cutch where drinkable 
water was not available, and thirst was added to the untold mise¬ 
ries and afflictions of the soldiers. 17 With great difficulty, how¬ 
ever, the army reached Gujarat whence the governor Nizam-ul- 
Mulk, who had failed to send the much-needed supplies and guides, 
was expelled and was replaced by Zafar Khan. 

The greater part of the year 1363 the Sultan spent in recouping 
his strength in Gujarat. About this time he received an invitation 
from Bahrain, a rival prince of the Bahmanl dynasty, to intervene 
and conquer the Deccan. It was a good opportunity which, if seized, 
might have enabled the Sultan to conquer the Bahmanl kingdom. 
But FIruz, who had set his heart on Sind, refused the offer. Fie 
came back and besieged Tattah, whose ruler surrendered and sued 
for peace. He accompanied the Sultan to Delhi, but after some time 
was restored to the government of Sind on condition of paying an 


95 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


annual tribute. 18 The Sultan was sorry for having undertaken 
the Sind expedition and swore not to launch any aggressive cam¬ 
paign in future. To those who had suffered and died in the Rann 
of Cutch he made concessions by enabling their heirs to enjoy the 
property of the deceased rent-free. 

The year 1374 was a melancholy one in the course of which 
died Fath Khan the eldest and most talented of the sons of FIruz. 
This event almost unhinged the mind of FIruz, so much so that the 
efficiency of administration declined considerably and the empire 
became decadent. He appointed one Damaghani governor of 
Gujarat in place of Zafar Khan, merely because Damaghani had 
promised to send more money annually, which the other declared 
himself unable to do. As soon as Damaghani arrived in Gujarat, 
his extortionate demands were opposed and, finding himself unable 
to fulfil his promise, he broke into rebellion. But he was slain by 
the amiran-i-sadah, who sent his head to Delhi, The Sultan then 
appointed one Malik Mufarrah or Farhat-ul-Mulk to the govern¬ 
ment of Gujarat (A.D. 1377). 

Another difficult situation arose in 1377 when the zamindars 
of Etawa threatened to rebel. It should be noted that the Etawa 
district had long been recalcitrant, and the revenue in that district 
had almost always to be collected with the help of armed force. 
The rebellion of the zamindars was, however, put down by the 
Sultan. 

About the same time the Sultan led an expedition against 
Kharku, the Raja of Katehr (Rohilkhand), who had treacherously 
murdered the governor of Badaun, Sayyid Muhammad, and his two 
brothers. In A.D. 1380, the Sultan marched with an army to Katehr 
and perpetrated almost a wholesale massacre of the Hindus. In¬ 
deed, the massacre was so general and indiscriminate that one 
historian has remarked: “The spirit of the murdered Sayyids them¬ 
selves arose to intercede”. The Sultan then pursued Kharku, who 
fled into Kumaon. Here, again, although Kharku could not be seiz¬ 
ed, a very large number of Hindus were killed and 23,000 captured 
and enslaved. Before returning to Delhi, FIruz left a positive order 
to devastate Katehr annually for the next five years, and appointed 
an Afghan to execute this bloody work. The Sultan himself annu¬ 
ally visited the region during the next five years in order to see 
that his ferocious order was duly carried into effect. The result 
was, as a contemporary chronicler has observed: “In those years 
not an acre of land was cultivated, no man slept in his house, and 
the death of the three Sayyids was avenged on countless thousands 
of Hindus”. 19 


96 


FIRUZ SHAH 


In 1385 the Sultan founded one more city, called in derision 
Firuzpur Ikhleri or Akhirinpur, i.e. the last of his cities, since, seni¬ 
lity and decay of intellect having overtaken him, the Sultan was not 
able to found any other city or construct any more works of public 
utility. 

Akhirlnpur set the seal to the personal history of Sultan Firuz. 
He had now reached the age of eighty 19a and was thoroughly domi¬ 
nated by the minister Khan Jahan. The latter became so powerful 
that he cast covetous eyes on the throne and endeavoured to cap¬ 
ture it by removing the legal heir, prince Muhammad Khan. But 
the scheme failed, and the cunning minister Khan Jahan fled to 
Mewat, seeking shelter with its chief, Koka Chauhan. Sultan Firuz 
then associated prince Muhammad with him in the administration 
and even gave him the royal title. The joint rule of the father and 
son—the latter being styled Nasir-ud-din Muhammad Shah—was 
proclaimed on August 22, 1387. 20 Khan Jahan was seized and 
killed. 

Muhammad had gone to Sirmur for a hunting excursion, when 
news reached him that Farhat-ul-Mulk, the governor of Gujarat, 
had murdered Sikandar Khan, who had been appointed to succeed 
him. Muhammad hastened back to Delhi, but instead of taking 
suitable steps to suppress the revolt, gave himself up entirely to 
pleasure. He dismissed the officers of the court who attempted to 
rouse him from his lethargy, and filled their places with parasites 
and flatterers. The nobles of the court thereupon rose against him 
and were supported by the populace. Being defeated in a bloody 
battle, they were driven into the city which, for two days, became 
a scene of civil war with all its attendant horrors. On the third 
day the rebels, who had secured the palace, brought out the old 
King in a litter and placed it on the street between the combatants. 
The soldiers of Muhammad received the Sultan with cries of joy 
and crowded round him. Muhammad, thus deserted, fled to Sirmur. 
Firuz again resumed his full authority but, being old and infirm, 
acceded to the request of his household troops to place on the throne 
Ghiyas-ud-din, the son of his eldest son Fath Khan. Shortly after 
this Firuz died in 1388. 21 

Firuz Shah was more than forty years of age when he ascended 
the throne, and it seems that he had learnt a good lesson from the 
reactions and revolts of the preceding reign. He had been hereto¬ 
fore a passive instrument in the hands of the reactionary ‘ulama’ 
and saints; and he continued to play the same role throughout his 
reign of 37 years (1351-88). Thus the State under him came under 
the influence of the theologians, and this is perhaps the reason of 

97 

D.S,—7 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


his popularity. ‘Aflf, the contemporary historian and author of 
the Tdrikh-i-Firuz Shdhi, has painted FIruz in the brightest colour 
and the author of the Tdrikh-i-Muhdrak Shdhi depicted him as an 
ideal ruler under whom all kinds of oppression, tyranny, high¬ 
handedness, violence, decline of the realm and rebellion of the 
people—a curse with which the reign of the late Sultan Muhammad 
Tughluq Shah had been afflicted—were replaced by justice, equity, 
peace, prosperity and consolidation. 22 Learning and knowledge 
were promoted and the numbers of ‘ulama’ and doctors of law in- 
creased. ‘Aflf rejoices to record the deference paid by FIruz to the 
learned and holy men in court and the harmony and good feeling 
which subsisted between FIruz Shah and his amirs, a blessing which 
could not have been attained without a complete overhaul of the 
policy and administration of the preceding reign. FIruz conferred 
new offices on the amirs and gained the full co-operation of the 
'ulama/ and saints by granting them stipends and aids. 

All these were sure to enlist the sympathy of the Muslims, 
particularly as FIruz, orthodox in his belief and practices, offered 
a striking contrast to his predecessor, who had shown but scant re¬ 
gard to the Muslim divines. But there were other very good reasons 
for the great popularity of FIruz. He held many liberal views, 
which were far in advance of his age, and was probably the first 
Muslim ruler in India, who regarded the promotion of material wel¬ 
fare of subjects as a more important duty of the king than wars 
and conquests. 

Contemporary records refer to the high principles which FIruz 
adopted as the basis of his government. FIruz himself has frankly 
explained his conception of royal duty in a small book written by 
himself and entitled Futuhdt-i-Flruz Shdhi, 23 which contains a brief 
summary of the res gestae of his reign, or as he designated them, 
his victories. The following passage from this work is worth being 
quoted in full in view of the horrors of inhuman torture, which the 
King, perhaps alone throughout the middle ages, had expressed so 
vividly and taken steps to prevent. 

“In the reigns of former kings the blood of many Musulmans 
had been shed, and many varieties j>f torture employed. Amputa¬ 
tion of hands and feet, ears and noses, tearing out the eyes, pour¬ 
ing molten lead into the throat, crushing the bones of the hands 
and feet with mallets, burning the body with fire, driving iron nails 
into the hands, feet, and bosom, cutting the sinews, sawing men 
asunder; these and many similar tortures were practised. The 
great and merciful God made me, His servant, hope and seek for 
His mercy by devoting myself to prevent the unlawful killing of 

98 


FIRUZ SHAH 


Musulmans, and the infliction of any kind of torture upon them or 
upon any men.. 

“Through the mercy which God has shown to me these severities 
and terrors have been exchanged for tenderness, kindness and 
mercy. Fear and respect have thus taken firmer hold of the hearts 
of men, and there has been no need of executions, scourgings, tortures, 
or terrors”. 24 

Side by side with the abolition of mutilation and tortures,, we 
should mention his liberal and humane attitude towards slaves. The 
following is culled from the T&rikh-i-Firuz Shahz of Shams-i-Siraj 
‘Afif: “The Sultan commanded his great fief-holders and officers to 
capture slaves whenever they were at war, and to pick out and send 
the best for the service of the court. The chiefs and officers naturally 
exerted themselves in procuring more and more slaves and a great 
number of them were thus collected. When they were found to be 
in excess, the Sultan sent them to important cities. In all cases, 
provision was made for their support in a liberal manner. Arrange¬ 
ment was made for educating the slaves and training them in various 
arts and crafts. In some places they were provided for in the army. 
It has been estimated that in the city and in the various fiefs, there 
were 180,000 slaves for whose maintenance and comfort the Sultan 
took special care. About 12,000 slaves became artisans of various 
kinds, and 40,000 worked as military guards to Sultan. The Sultan 
created a separate department with a number of officers for ad¬ 
ministering the affairs of these slaves. Gradually the slaves in¬ 
creased to such a degree that they were employed in all sorts of 
domestic duties, so much so that there was no occupation in which 
the slaves of Firuz Shah were not employed. By order of the Sultan, 
the great feudal chieftains also treated the slaves like children pro¬ 
viding them with food and raiments, lodging them and training them, 
and taking every care for their wants”. 25 

The Sultan gives a long list of more than twenty “frivolous, 
unlawful and unjust cesses”, which were collected by his predecessors 
but were abolished by him because these sources of revenue were 
not “recognised by the sacred law and approved by books of autho¬ 
rity”. While recording this he quotes the following couplet. 

“Better a people’s weal than treasures vast, 

Better an empty chest than hearts downcast”. 26 

Firuz made many changes in the existing practices and customs 
in order to bring them into conformity with the sacred Law. 27 For 
this reason he strictly realized Jizya from the non-Muslims, as will 
be related later. 


99 



THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Flruz had a love for building new cities. He is said to have 
founded 300 towns, which is obviously an exaggeration. Among 
the important towns founded by him may be mentioned Fatehabad, 
Hissar, Firuzpur (near Badaun), Jaunpur and Firuzabad. The 
last-named city, built on the banks of the Yamuna, became his 
favourite residence, and is now represented fcy the ruins of ‘Firoz 
Kotla’ a little to the south of the Red Fort in Delhi. The new city 
comprised the sites of eighteen villages and extended from Indarpat 
(near Sher Shah’s fort) to Kushk-i-shikar (on the Ridge), five kos 
apart. It was crowded with buildings and there were eight public 
mosques, each large enough to accommodate 10,000 devotees. 28 

Great credit is due to Flruz for his public works, more parti¬ 
cularly the five canals for irrigation constructed by him. The long¬ 
est and most important of these ran for 150 miles from the Yamuna 
watering the arid tract as far as the city of Hissar founded by the 
Sultan. Another, 96 miles long, connected the Sutlej with the 
Ghaghra. Two others ran respectively from the Ghaghra and the 
Yamuna to the town of Firuzabad, another new town established 
by the Sultan. The fifth served the tract from the neighbourhood 
of Sirmur hills to the town of Hansi. Wolseley Haig very rightly 
observes: “Flruz Shah is still remembered as the author of schemes 
of irrigation, and traces of his canals yet remain. He also sank 150 
wells for purposes of irrigation and for the use of travellers and 
indulged in a passion for building which equalled, if it did not 
surpass, that of the Roman Emperor Augustus”. 29 Firishta credits 
him with the construction of 50 dams across rivers to promote irri¬ 
gation, 40 mosques, 30 colleges with mosques attached, 20 palaces, 
100 caravanserais, 200 towns, 30 reservoirs or lakes for irrigating 
lands, 100 hospitals, 5 mausolea, 100 public baths, 10 monumental 
pillars, 10 public wells, and 150 bridges, besides numerous gardens 
and pleasure houses. Lands were assigned at the same time for the 
maintenance of these public buildings, in order to keep them in 
thorough repair. 30 

Flruz appointed as assessor of the revenue an amir named 
Khvaja Hisam-ud-din Junaid, who made extensive tours for six years 
and made a comprehensive survey which enabled the Sultan to re¬ 
duce the State-demand of the revenue. Although this was not made 
upon the sure basis of measurement of land or an estimate of the 
actual produce, the land revenue was fixed more or less on a perma¬ 
nent basis, and this, by itself, was a creditable achievement. The 
Sultan also abolished the practice of levying benevolences which 
the provincial governors had to pay at the time of their appointment 
and annually, for they ultimately fell upon the shoulders of the 
people. Due to the excavation of irrigation canals an enormous 


100 


FIRUZ SHAH 


area of land, which had hitherto remained fallow, came under culti¬ 
vation. This, as well as the levy of additional ten per cent of the 
rent for the use of irrigation canals, increased the revenue to the 
extent of two lakhs of tankas. 31 Thriving villages were to be seen 
uniformly in the vicinity of Delhi, besides twelve hundred gardens, 
which contained an incalculable number of fruit-bearing trees. The 
enormous output of fruits from these and other gardens laid out by 
Firuz enabled the treasury to realise the sum of one lakh and eighty 
thousand tankas annually. 32 Similarly the revenue from the Doab 
amounted to eighty lakhs of tankas, and that from the crown lands to 
six crores and eighty-five lakhs of tankas 33 The promotion of trade 
and agriculture was a distinctive feature of the reign and, in spite of 
the military expeditions, sieges, and skirmishes, no recourse was had 
to increased levy. ‘Aflf testifies to the all-round prosperity pre¬ 
vailing everywhere in the country and described the cheapness and 
low price of food, cloths, and other things. He observes that the 
necessaries of life were abundant and grain continued cheap through¬ 
out the reign of FIruz, as in that of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl, but ‘without 
any effort’, i.e. without any arbitrary regulations 34 

Credit is also due to FIruz for simplifying the legal system 
and discouraging the use of spies, repairing and maintaining the 
tombs and monuments of his predecessors, and preservation of the 
two Asokan pillars which he brought from Topra and Mirat and 
fitted up carefully in Delhi. 36 

FIruz was not only a great patron of learning but was himself 
an accomplished scholar. He established thirty madrasas includ¬ 
ing three great colleges. Teachers were liberally paid by the State 
and stipends were granted to students. According to Firishta, FIruz 
encouraged learned men to reside in different parts of the empire 
for the sake of imparting instruction to the people. The same autho¬ 
rity tells us that FIruz found a fine library of Hindu books, con¬ 
sisting of 1300 volumes, at the temple of JvalamukhT, in Kangra 
and ordered one of them, which treated of philosophy, astrology, 
and divination, to be translated into Persian, and called it Dald‘il-i 
Firuz Shahi 36 He was fond of history and patronized Baram, ‘Aflf 
and the author of the Sirat-i-Firiiz Shahi. Reference has been made 
above to the Futuhat-i-Flruz Shahi composed by him. It is said by 
‘Aflf that the sum of thirty-six lakhs of tankas was spent for allow¬ 
ances given to learned men and Quran-readers. 37 

One of the earliest acts of Firuz was his vicarious atonement 
for the sins of his predecessor Muhammad bin Tughluq. He pre¬ 
sented gifts to the heirs of those who had been killed, and to those 
that were mutilated during the reign of the latter, and secured 


101 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


written statements from them to the effect that they were satisfied. 
The ‘written deeds of pardon’, duly attested by witnesses, were 
collected in a box and placed in the tomb of: Muhammad Tughluq 
in order that God might pardon him for his misdeeds. 38 Incidentally, 
as noted above, it shows the contemporary opinion about the charac¬ 
ter of Muhammad bin Tughluq and the light in which it was viewed 
even by his closest friends and well-wishers. There is, however, 
no doubt that in doing this Firuz was actuated by a spirit of piety 
and benevolence rarely witnessed among the rulers of the age. The 
same spirit marks two other institutions started by him. The first 
was a ‘charity bureau’ (Diwan-i-Khainat) which was established to 
help the widows and orphans and give pecuniary help to facilitate 
marriage of Muslim girls who remained unmarried for want of 
dowry. 39 Another was an agency to provide employment, mostly 
clerical and administrative, to those who were unemployed. 40 It was 
conducted more on a chariable basis than a regular bureau of 
employment. The Sultan also established a charitable hospital 
near Delhi, where the patients were treated by skilful physicians 
and got diet and medicine free of charge. 41 

In view of all this it is no wonder that Firuz has been highly 
praised by many Indian writers. There is, however, also a dark 
side of the picture. It should be noted that the reign of Firuz Shah 
was a period of reaction marked by the revival of influence, even 
in affairs of State, of those maulavis, muftis , qazls, pirs and religi¬ 
ous leaders and dignitaries, who had been humiliated under his 
revolutionary predecessor, and by the preponderance of nobles— 
maliks and amirs or the amiran-i-sadah —who had revolted against 
the latter. The period also witnessed the re-emergence of the mer¬ 
cenary spirit among that section of the f ulamd ’ and saints who were 
really ignorant of the ethics of Islam. 

Firuz lacked the military skill and warlike spirit which distin¬ 
guished his predecessor and was a sine qua non for successful rule 
in those days. He also lacked in energy and enthusiasm. He fail¬ 
ed to recover Bengal and made no attempt to regain authority in 
the Deccan and South India. He was weak and irresponsible and, 
as in Bengal, abandoned the chances of victory on account of either 
incapacity or religious scruples which more befitted a darvish than 
a ruler. 

The Sultan was too idle and ease-loving to supervise the ad¬ 
ministration in a proper manner, and the result was corruption and 
inefficiency. What was worse, his spirit of benevolence went even 
so far as to shield his own corrupt officials. His misplaced bene¬ 
volence for old and inefficient soldiers and connivance at corrup- 


102 


FIRUZ SHAH 


tion 42 gradually destroyed the efficiency of the army and civil ad¬ 
ministration, and distinctly lowered the standard of both. The 
Sultan was addicted to the pleasures of the harem and his high 
officials imitated his folly. ‘ r -t. 

The Sultan re-introduced the system of granting jdgirs to civil 
and military officers discouraged by his predecessor as well as by 
‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl, and the system of hereditary appointment 
abolished by Muhammad Tughluq. 43 He also deviated from their 
practices by extending the farming system and getting the land 
revenue settled with the highest bidder. These considerably im¬ 
paired the efficiency of administration, and inflicted hardships on 
the peasants. 

The weak and vacillating policy of Firuz was conspicuous 
throughout his reign, in both civil administration and military 
affairs. The only occasion on which he showed strength, resolu¬ 
tion and firm determination was in the persecution of the Hindus. 
A glaring instance is furnished by his barbarous method of warfare 
in Katehr, referred to above, and the tenacity with which he per¬ 
secuted the Hindus of that region offers a striking contrast to his 
humane attitude towards Muslim rebels, for example those in 
Bengal. As he himself said, “he was resolved never more to make 
war upon Muslims.” 44 

This brings us to the question of the bigotry of Firuz Shah 
which formed the blackest spot on his character. Anyone who 
reads the Futuhdt-i-Firuz Shdhi 45 written by the Sultan himself, 
cannot avoid the impression that Firuz possessed both the virtues 
and vices of an orthodox Muslim ruler. The most prominent of 
these vices was the intolerance of any faith other than orthodox 
Islam. It is evident from this book that the Sultan divided man- 
kind into two groups, Musulmans (by which he meant Musulman 
of the approved orthodox type), and non-Musulmans, and regard¬ 
ed the former alone as his special concern. This will be evident, 
among others, from the passage quoted above 45a regarding the 
abolition of torture. But the Sultan was not satisfied merely with 
this negative attitude. He considered it to be his duty to suppress 
irreligion and he takes pride that he laboured diligently “until 
things repugnant to religion were set aside.” Of course by religion 
he meant only the orthodox Muslim faith. 

So far as the Hindus were concerned, the following passage 
gives an idea of his bigoted attitude:— _ ^ 

“The Hindus and idol-worshippers had agreed to pay the money 
for toleration (zar-i-zimmiya), and had consented to the poll tax 
(jizya ), in return for which they and their families enjoyed security. 


103 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


These people now erected new idol-temples in the city and the 
environs in opposition to the Law of the Prophet which declares 
that such temples are not to be tolerated. Under Divine guidance 
I destroyed these edifices, and killed those leaders of infidelity who 
seduced others into error, and the lower orders I subjected to stripes 
and chastisement, until this abuse was entirely abolished. The fol¬ 
lowing is an instance:—In the village of Maluh there is a tank which 
they call kund (tank). Here they had built idol-temples, and on 
certain days the Hindus were accustomed to proceed thither on 
horseback, and wearing arms. Their women and children also 
went out in palankins and carts. There they assembled in thou¬ 
sands and performed idol worship. This abuse had been so over¬ 
looked that the bazar people took out there all sorts of provisions, 
and set up stalls and sold their goods. Some graceless Musulmans, 
thinking only of their gratification, took part in these meetings. 
When intelligence of this came to my ears my religious feelings 
prompted me at once to put a stop to this scandal and offence to the 
religion of Islam. On the day of the assembling I went there in 
person, and I ordered that the leaders of these people and the pro¬ 
moters of this abomination should be put to death. I forbade the 
infliction of any severe punishments on the Hindus in general, but I 
destroyed their idol temples, and instead thereof raised mosques”. 46 
Firuz also cites another concrete instance where the Hindus who had 
erected new temples were put to death before the gate of the palace, 
and their books, the images of deities, and the vessels used in their 
worship were publicly burnt. This was to serve “as a warning to 
all men, that no zimrrii could follow such wicked practices in a 
Musulman country”. 41 Other instances are given by contemporary 
writers. ‘Afif gives a graphic description of one such case. A 
Brahman of Delhi was charged with “publicly performing the wor¬ 
ship of idols in his house and perverting Muhammadan women, 
leading them to become infidels”. The Brahman was told that 
according to law he must “either become a Musulman or be burned.” 
The Brahman having refused to change his faith, “was tied hand 
and foot and cast into a burning pile of faggots”. ‘Afif, who wit¬ 
nessed the execution, ends his account by saying: “Behold the Sultan’s 
strict adherence to law and rectitude, how he would not deviate in 
the least from its decrees”. 48 

In two respects, the Sultan was more oppressive to the Hindus 
than his predecessors. In the first place, he imposed jizya tax upon 
the Brahmans, who were never required to pay them before. The 
Brahmans went in a body to the Sultan to protest against this in¬ 
novation. “They were determined”, they said, “to collect wood 
and to burn themselves under the walls of the palace rather than 


104 


FIRUZ SHAH 


pay the tax”. The Sultan “replied that they might burn and des¬ 
troy themselves at once, for they would not escape from the pay¬ 
ment”. “The Brahmans remained fasting for several days at the 
palace until they were on the point of death”. The Hindus of the 
city, in order to save the lives of the Brahmans, told them that they 
would undertake to pay it for them. Ultimately the Brahmans 
begged the Sultan to reduce the amount of the tax, and this was 
agreed. 49 

In the second place, the Sultan himself boasts that he adopted 
every means to induce the Hindus to adopt Islam. This will be 
evident from the following passage:— 

“I encouraged my infidel subjects to embrace the religion of 
the Prophet, and I proclaimed that every one who repeated the 
creed and became a Musulman should be exempt from the jizya, or 
poll-tax. Information of this came to the ears of the people at large 
and great numbers of Hindus presented themselves, and were ad¬ 
mitted to the honour of Islam. Thus they came forward day by day 
from every quarter, and, adopting the faith, were exonerated from 
the jizya , and were favoured with presents and honours”. 60 This 
is probably the first recorded instance, after Muslim conquest of 
India, of the State itself becoming a proselytising agency. 

Attempts have been made to show that the Sultan was tolerant 
to the Hindus, by citing some instances that even when he conquered 
Hindu kingdoms, he did not destroy their temples or image. This 
is belied by the following facts, among others. 

The Sirat-i-Firuz ShaM, as noted above, was a text written 
either at the dictation or at the dictates of Firuz Shah himself. Ac¬ 
cording to this chronicle, two of the objectives of the Sultan in under¬ 
taking the expedition against Jajnagar or Orissa, as noted above, 
were “massacring the unbelievers and demolishing their temples”. 
The detailed account given in this book leaves no doubt that these 
objects were pursued with relentless severity. As related above, 
Firuz, after the conquest of Orissa, proceeded to Puri, the famous 
place of Hindu pilgrimage. Referring to his activities the chronicler 
records:—“Allah, who is the only true God and has no other emana¬ 
tion, endowed the king of Islam with the strength to destroy this 
ancient shrine on the eastern sea-coast and to plunge it into the 
sea, and after its destruction, he ordered the nose of the image of 
Jagannath to be perforated and disgraced it by casting it down on 
the ground. They dug out other idols which were worshipped by 
the polytheists in the kingdom of Jajnagar, and overthrew them 
as they did the image of Jagannath, for being laid in front of the 
mosques along the path of the Sunnis and way of the musallis (the 


105 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


multitude who offer their prayers) and stretched them in front of 
the portals of every mosque, so that the body and sides of the images 
might be trampled at the time of ascent and descent, entrance and 
exit, by the shoes on the feet of the Muslims”. 151 

When Flruz invaded Nagarkot he desecrated the famous temple 
at Jvalamukhi. We learn from Firishta that the Sultan “broke the 
idols of Jvalamukhi, mixed their fragments with the flesh of cows, 
and hung them in nosebags round the necks of Brahmins, and that 
he sent the principal idol as a trophy to Medina”. 162 There may be 
some exaggeration in all this, but it is impossible to ignore the 
evidences cited above and to avoid the conclusion that Flruz was the 
greatest bigot of this age and the precursor of Sikandar Lodi and 
Aurangzeb in this respect. It is only fair to add, however, that he 
was equally intolerant towards heterodox Muslim sects. He himself 
describes his action against the Shiahs as follows:— 

“The sect of Sheets, also called Rawdfiz, had endeavoured to 
make proselytes. They wrote treatises and books, and gave instruc¬ 
tion and lectures upon the tenets of their sect, and traduced and 
reviled the first chiefs of our religion (on whom be the peace of 
God!). I seized them all and I convicted them of their error and 
perversions. On the most zealous I inflicted punishment ( siydsat ), 
and the rest I visited with censure (tdztr) and threats (tahdlb) of 
public punishment (tashhir-i-zijr ). Their books I burnt in public, 
and so by the Grace of God, the influence of this sect was entirely 
suppressed”. 63 

The contemporary historians, Baranl and ‘Aflf, are full of 
praises for Flruz Tughluq and describe him as a just, merciful, and 
benevolent ruler. Modern writers like Elliot 63a and Elphinstone 
have even gone so far as to regard him as the Akbar of the Sultanate 
period. The comparison is odious and, Ishwari Prasad has very 
rightly observed, “Flruz had not even a hundredth part of the genius 
of that great-hearted and broad-minded monarch”. 64 Flruz may 
justly be regarded as the last of the notable Sultans of Delhi, but 
it is difficult to agree with the view that “the reign of Flruz closes 
the most brilliant epoch of Muslim rule in India before the reign 
of Akbar”. 65 For Sher Shah’s reign is no less brilliant; besides, as a 
ruler, he occupies a much higher place in history, and was really 
a great king, a title to which Flruz can certainly lay no claim, either 
by his character and personality, or by his achievements. 

Flruz regarded the Sultanate as a Muslim State. 56 So, “as far 
as the beneficent activities of the State were concerned (e.g. educa¬ 
tion, care of the poor, provision of the unemployed, marriage of 
the poor girls, religious endowments, etc.), it was largely the 


106 


FIRUZ SHAH 


Muslims who benefited”. This is clearly admitted by ‘Afif. “Poli¬ 
tical power remained exclusively in Muslim hands and no post of 
influence is known to have been held by any Hindu”. 57 In all these 
respects Firuz offers a striking contrast to Akbar and, to a certain 
extent, to Sher Shah. 

Although the reign of Firuz was marked by mildness and bene¬ 
ficent activities, in striking contrast to that of his predecessor, it 
also undermined, to a large extent, the foundation of the Sultanate. 
The active interest and influence of the ‘ulamd’ and mushaikhs in 
affairs of State which Firuz permitted, partly as policy and partly 
as an article of faith, was a retrograde step. His connivance at the 
inefficiency of public servants, misplaced leniency in dealing with 
civil and military officials, and undue favours shown to the nobility 
weakened the entire administrative machinery. His aversion to war 
against the Muslims, even when it was imperative,—in striking con¬ 
trast to the brutal severity with which he treated the Hindus of 
Katehr—, and particularly his unwillingness (on the specious ground 
of saving Muslim women from disgrace) or inability to carry the 
fights to a finish, destroyed the stability of the empire. The orga¬ 
nization of the slaves, though promoted by humane consideration, 
was no doubt partly due also to a desire to create a personal body¬ 
guard on which the Sultan could trust for his own safety. But as 
could be easily foreseen, it developed into something like a Praeto¬ 
rian Guard and proved to be a great disturbing factor in the State. 
On the whole, in spite of peace, prosperity, and contentment that 
prevailed during the long reign of Firuz Shah, no one can possibly 
doubt that his policy and administrative measures contributed to 
a large extent to the downfall of the Delhi Sultanate, and accele¬ 
rated the process of decline that had already set in during his 
predecessor’s reign. 

1. Wolseley Haig is the great protagonist of this view ( JRAS, 1922, pp. 365 ff; CHI, 
III, 173). The same view is reiterated by Sri Ram Sharma ( PIHC, XV, 176). 
Haig’s view is opposed by Ishwari Prasad (IPMI, 263 ff) and A. C. Banerji (IC, 
II, 47 ff) on the grounds stated above in the text, among others. 

2. For a detailed account of the two expeditions to Bengal cf. Chapter X, E. The 
Sultan issued an interesting proclamation specifying the grounds of his invasion 
of Bengal and holding out inducements to various classes of people of this pro¬ 
vince to seek his favour ( JASB, N. S. XIX, (1923) 279). 

3. The details of the campaign are given in two contemporary official sources. The 
relevant extract in the first, Simt-i-FlrUz Shaki, has been summarized and 
translated by N. B. Roy ( JRASBL, VIII, 57-98), and the account in the text 
is mainly based upon it (cf. specially pp. 74-77). Valuable information is sup¬ 
plied by ‘Ain-ul-Mulk’s account in Inshd-i-Mahru which has been translated 
by Abdul Wali in JASB, N. S., XIX, 283 ff. 

4. The whole of this account, including the passages quoted is taken from the 
English translation of Sircit-i-Firuz Shdhi ( JRASBL, VIII, pp. 61 ff).

and the desecration of the images of the temple to which reference is made in 
p. 106 and note 52. 

15. This generally accepted view, based on ‘Afifs account (HIED, III. 319-20), is 
opposed by N. B. Roy. He draws attention to a letter written by ‘Ain-ul- 
Mulk which shows that as “Banabanah, a chief of Sindh, allying himself with 
hordes of Mughals, made raids into the rich provinces of the Punjab and Gujarat/’ 
and his “daring and audacity had surpassed all bounds,” Sultan Firuz was 
approached by the writer to repel the attacks. N. B. Roy therefore argues that 
the expedition to Sind “was the necessary sequel to Babiniya’s aggressions and 
did not spring from either ambitious schemes of conquest or motives of venge¬ 
ance as stated by ‘Afif ( JRASBL , IV, 285 ff).” That the suppression of the 
rebels was an object of the expedition is clearly stated in Sirat-i-Firuz Shahi, 
but that does not mean that the other objects were absent. It is hardly likely 
that an official chronicle would refer to vengeance or lust for conquest as 
object of the expedition. There is also nothing in ‘Ain-ul-Mulk’s letter which 
excludes these objects. 

16. ‘Afif mentions Jam and Babiniya as names of two separate persons (HIED, III. 
322). But as Ishwari Prasad has pointed out (IPM1, p. 278, f.n. 1), Jam was 
the title of Banhbina. For the spelling of the name Banhbina see the Chapter 

• ' on Sind, n. 21. 

17. Harrowing details are given by ‘Afif (HIED, III. pp. 324 ff). 

18. According to ‘Afif, “the son of the Jam and Tamachi, brother of Babiniya, were 
placed over Thatta, and titles were conferred upon them. They paid four lacs 
of tankas in cash, by way of marking their allegiance, and agreed to pay several 
lacs of tankas in money and goods yearly.” (HIED, I III, 336). But both Mir 
Ma‘sum and Firishta say that Jam Babiniya was restored to the government of 
Sind (Briggs, I, 455; IPMI, 280). 

19. Briggs, I. 457; CHI, III. 182-3. 

19a. See n. 21. 

20. Though theoretically a joint rule (CHI, III, 184), Firuz virtually abdicated in 
favour of his son who ascended the throne, as Firishta puts it (Briggs, I, 459). 

21. According to ‘Afif, Firuz was born in 709 A.H. (A.D. 1309-10) (HIED, III. 271); 
therefore he must have been about 80 years of age at the time of his death. 
This age has been put as 83 by Haig (CHI, III. 184) and 90 by Ishwari Prasad 
(IPMI, 296).

(QAS-, Appendix H. p. 228).

(monasteries) in Delhi and Flruzabad “in which travellers from all directions 
were receivable as guests for three days” (HIED, III. 354).

32. TKB, II. 123, HIED, (III. 346) puts the figure as eighty thousand.

34. Ibid, 344. ‘Afif draws a rosy picture of the economic condition of common 
people. “Their homes were replete with grain, property, horses, and furniture; 
every one had plenty of gold and silver; no woman was without her ornaments, 
and no house was wanting in excellent beds and couches. Wealth abounded 
and comforts were general.” (HIED, III. 290). This is too idealized a picture 
to be taken at its face value.

images (HIED, III, 314). 

52. Firishta prefaces this assertion with the remark “Some historians state that’’ 
etc. (Briggs, I, 454). ‘Afif does not refer to the desecration but vigorously 
refutes the report “spread by the infidels” that the Sultan “held a golden um¬ 
brella over the head of the idol.” It should be noted that ‘Afif denied the truth 
of the report on the authority of his father who was in the Sultan’s retinue. 
The story that Firuz held a golden umbrella over the head of a Hindu image, 
incredible in itself, may therefore be dismissed as a myth. ‘Afif refutes a 
similar charge against Muhammad bin Tughluq and adds that these two Sultans 
“whenever they took an idol temple they broke and destroyed it”. This evid¬ 
ently supports the desecration of the Jvalamukhi temple by Firuz, of whom 
‘Afif was a contemporary. According to ‘Afif, Firuz addressed the assembled 
Hindus at Jvalamukhi temple as follows: “O fools and weak-minded, how can 
you pray to and worship this stone, for our holy law tells us that those who 
oppose tiie decrees of our religion will go to hell” (HIED, III. 318). Ishwari 
Prasad translates this passage somewhat differently (IPMI, 276).

CHAPTER VI 


THE SUCCESSORS OF FIRUZ SHAH 

On the death of Firuz Shah, his grandson, the son of Fath Khan, 
formally ascended the throne under the title of Ghiyas-ud-dln Tugh- 
luq Shah II. Malik Firuz ‘All was appointed wazir and received the 
title of Khan Jahan. Prince Muhammad, the son of Firuz, who 
was once the joint ruler with his father under the title Nasir-ud-dln 
Muhammad Shah, but was driven away, as mentioned above, 1 
and was now residing at Sirmur, made preparations to contest the 
throne. An army was sent against him under the wazir and Baha¬ 
dur Nahir, a Rajput chief of Mewat, who had embraced Islam. On 
the approach of the royal army Muhammad fled to the mountains 
and occupied a strong position, but being defeated and driven from 
one position to another, he shut himself up at the strong fort of 
Nagarkot (Kangra). The royal army did not besiege that fort, but 
returned to Delhi. 

Ghiyas-ud-dm proved to be a worthless ruler. He gave him¬ 
self up to pleasure and debauchery, and neglected the affairs of 
State. His conduct produced laxity in administration and dissatis¬ 
faction among the amirs. Matters came to a head when the Sultan 
treated with cruelty and imprisoned his own brother, Salar. His 
cousin, Abu Bakr, the son of Zafar Khan, the third son of Firuz, 
dreading the same fate, fled and organized a conspiracy against the 
Sultan. 2 Their cause was supported by Rukn-ud-din, the deputy 
ivazir, who had a large following among the household troops, the 
famous Ghulamdn-i-Firuz Shdlril (Slaves of Firuz Shah). Several 
dtfter chiefs of high rank also joined the conspiracy. The conspi¬ 
rators rushed into the palace and killed Malik Mubarak Kablr, the 
amlr-ul-umra ( . Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq, thus surprised, fled with 
his wazir through a gate opening towards the Yamuna. They were 
pursued by Rukn-ud-din and, being overtaken, were immediately 
put to death (February 18, 1389). Next day the conspirators put 
Abu Bakr on the throne, and Rukn-ud-din became the wazir. 

Abu Bakr could not enjoy the throne for long. The amlmn-i- 
sadah of Samaria rose in revolt, and having killed their leader, Malik 
Sultan Shah Khushdil, who was loyal to Abu Bakr, invited Prince 
Muhammad to join them and assert his rights to the throne. Muham¬ 
mad collected an army and proceeded to Samana. There he pro¬ 
claimed himself king (April, 1389) and marched towards Delhi. 


110 


THE SUCCESSORS OF FlRUZ SHAH 


On the way he was joined by several amirs and entered Delhi at 
the head of 50,000 horse. Delhi now became the seat of the civil 
war, and the nobles of the court joined one side or the other accord¬ 
ing to their interests or inclinations, Bahadur Nahir of Mewat 
joined Abu Bakr, and with his help the Sultan succeeded in inflict¬ 
ing a crushing defeat upon Muhammad. The latter fled to the Doab 
and fixed his head-quarters at Jalesar, 3 where he was joined by 
many nobles of the court, chief among whom were Malik Sarvar, 
lately the kotiual of Delhi, and Nasir-ul-Mulk. The former was ap¬ 
pointed his minister under the title Khvaja Jahan, and the latter 
received the title Khizr Khan. Encouraged by the support Muham¬ 
mad again marched towards Delhi, but was again defeated and fell 
back on Jalesar. But in spite of this reverse, his authority was 
acknowledged in many districts to the north and west of Delhi, 
including Lahore, Multan, Sam,ana, Hissar, and Hansi. Chaos and 
confusion prevailed on all sides, and the troops of Muhammad 
oppressed the people of the Doab. The Hindu chiefs there, who had 
proved refractory even under earlier Sultans, now openly defied 
the authority of the Sultan. Humayun, son of Muhammad, advanced 
from Samana and plundered the country almost up to the walls of 
Delhi, but he was defeated at Panipat and fled to Samana. Encour¬ 
aged by this success Abu Bakr now decided to take the offensive 
and attack Muhammad at Jalesar. But as soon as he left Delhi, 
Muhammad, assured of the support of a strong faction of nobles^t 
the court, cleverly eluded the forces of his enemy, and occupied 
Delhi. Thereupon Abu Bakr retraced his steps and Muhammad 
made a precipitate retreat to Jalesar. But shortly afterwards Islam 
Khan, the Commander of the household troops, opened communi¬ 
cation with Muhammad. The knowledge of this conspiracy so 
alarmed Abu Bakr that he left Delhi and fled to Bahadur Nahir of 
Mewat. Taking advantage of this Muhammad again occupied Delhi, 
and ascended the throne at Firuzabad under his old royal title Nasfir- 
ud-dln Muhammad Shah (August, 1390). 

Islam Khan was appointed vjazir, but the household troops were 
provoked into rebellion by a royal order to take back all the ele¬ 
phants which had been seized by them. Most of them joined Abu 
Bakr, and a large number, found at Delhi, were put to death. 

The Sultan now recruited a new army and sent it against Abu 
Bakr under his son Humayun and wazir Islam Khan. Abu Bakr 
was defeated and captured, and kept a prisoner in the fort of Mirat 
where he died. 

The prolonged civil war, the worthless character of the rulers 
who succeeded Flruz, and the disloyal and selfish activities of the 


111 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


officials and amirs had brought the Sultanate on the verge of ruin. 
Though the new Sultan showed some energy, he could not stem the 
tide of decline. Farhat-ul-Mulk, the governor of Gujarat, threw 
off his allegiance in A.D. 1390, and ere long the province was lost 
to the empire as will be related later. Nearer home the Rajput 
chiefs of Etawa refused to pay tribute and declared independence. 
In A.D. 1391 Islam Khan proceeded with a large army and defeated 
the Rathor Rajput Narsingh Bhan, the leader and the most power¬ 
ful of the rebellious chiefs, and made peace with him. The other 
two important chiefs, the Rathor Sarvadharan, and Bir Bhan, the 
chief of the Vais Rajputs, also offered submission. But as soon as 
Islam Khan returned to Delhi with Narasingh Bhan, the chiefs again 
rose up in arms under Sarvadharan and ravaged Bilgram 4 and the 
adjacent districts. The Sultan marched in person, defeated them, 
and ‘levelled the fort of Etawa with the ground’. He then proceed¬ 
ed via Kanauj to Jalesar, and built a fort there, which was called 
after him Muhammadabad. 

The Sultan hastened back to Delhi as reports reached him that 
the wazlr, Islam Khan, was planning a rebellion. Islam pleaded 
innocence, but his own nephew, a Hindu, gave evidence against him, 
and he was condemned to death. According to Firishta, the charge 
was a false one and the whole affair was planned by Khvaja Jahan, 
who took the place of Islam Khan as wazlr. 5 Malik Muqarrab-ul- 
Mulk, who later distinguished himself as Muqarrab Khan, was ap¬ 
pointed governor of Muhammadabad. 

In A.D. 1393, the Rajput chiefs of Etawa again rebelled, but 
most of them were treacherously killed by Muqarrab-ul-Mulk, when 
they visited Kanauj at his invitation. The Sultan himself proceed¬ 
ed to Mewat to quell the rebellion there and, having laid waste the 
country, proceeded to Jalesar. There he fell ill when news reached 
him that Bahadur Nahir of Mewat had plundered the country up 
to the gates of Delhi. Though the Sultan was still suffering from 
fever, he hastened to Mewat, attacked Bahadur Nahir at Kotla and 
totally defeated him. After this, he returned to Muhammadabad 
and sent his son Humayun to crush Shaikha, the Khokar, who had 
rebelled and captured Lahore. But before the Prince left Delhi, 
the Sultan died at Jalesar (January, 1394). He was succeeded by 
Prince Humayun who assumed the title of ‘Ala-ud-dm Sikandar 
Shah. But he died within six weeks of his accession. 

On the death of Humayun his younger brother, Nasir-ud-din 
Mahmud Shah, was installed on the throne by a party of nobles in 
the court headed by Muqarrab-ul-Mulk who became Vakil-us- 
sultanat and received the title Muqarrab Khan. But the Sultanate 


112 


THE SUCCESSORS OF FlRUZ SHAH 


had now reached the last stages of disintegration. The provincial 
governors and Hindu chiefs openly defied the authority of the 
Sultan and became de facto sovereigns. Malik Sarvar Khvaja Jahan, 
who still continued in the post of the wazir, received the title of 
Malik-us-Sharq or King of the East, and was sent to subdue the 
rebellious chiefs of the east. He left Delhi in May 1394, and sub¬ 
dued the districts of Koil, Etawa and Kanauj. He then occupied 
Jaunpur and founded an independent kingdom with this city as 
his capital. Sarang Khan Lodi, governor of Dlpalpur, expelled Khizr 
Khan, the governor of Multan, defeated the turbulent Khokars, and 
placed his own brother Adil Khan in charge of Lahore. 

In the meanwhile, the Sultan, leaving Muqarrab Khan in charge 
of Delhi, proceeded to Gwalior in the company of Sa‘adat Khan, 
Mallu Iqbal Khan Lodi (brother of Sarang Khan), Malik ‘Ala-ud- 
dln Dharwal, and others. When they arrived near Gwalior, some 
of the amirs, led by Mallu, made a conspiracy against Sa‘adat 
Khan, as they were jealous of him for his great influence with the 
Sultan. The plot leaked out and some of the conspirators were 
put to death, but Mallu fled to Delhi and sought the protection of 
Muqarrab Khan. The latter, on learning that Sa‘adat Khan had 
sworn vengeance against him, closed the gates of Delhi against the 
Sultan when he returned with Sa‘adat Khan. The royal army laid 
siege to the city, but after three months, the Sultan’s party, being 
convinced that “the war not only originated, but was prosecuted 
solely on account of Sa'adat Khan”, accommodated matters with 
Muqarrab Khan, and was admitted into the city of Delhi. Sa‘adat, 
unable to conquer the fort of Delhi, and finding the rainy season 
to be near, marched to FIruzabad and raised Nusrat Khan, son of 
Fath Khan, to the throne under the title of Nusrat Shah. But the 
household troops of Flruz Tughluq, who had joined Sa‘adat Khan, 
was incensed at his conduct towards them and drove him from 
FIruzabad. Fie thereupon sought shelter with Muqarrab Khan who 
put him to death in 1394. 

There were now two Sultans in Delhi and the result was a 
protracted civil war. The amirs of FIruzabad, Doab, Sambal, Panipat, 
Jhajhar and Rohtak supported Nusrat Shah, while those of Delhi 
espoused the cause of Mahmud Shah. But none of the competitors 
for the throne could claim any real allegiance from any of the chiefs 
and nobles who all looked to their own interests alone. The situa¬ 
tion is tersely, but very correctly, described by Firishta in the 
following words: 

“The government fell into anarchy: civil war raged every¬ 
where; and a scene was exhibited, unheard of before, of two kings 

113 

D.S.—8 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


in arms against each other residing in the same capital. Tatar Khan, 
the son of Zafar Khan of Gujarat, and Fazlullah Balkhi, entitled 
Kutlugh Khan, joined the Prince Nusrat at FIruzabad. Muqarrab 
Khan and other chiefs espoused the cause of Mahmud Tughluq; 
while Bahadur Nahir and Mallu Iqbal Khan, with a strong body of 
troops, occupied the fort of Sir!, and remained neuter, (sic) but were 
prepared to join either party according to circumstances. Affairs 
remained in this state for three years, with astonishing equality; 
for if one monarch’s party had at any time the superiority, the 
balance was soon restored by the neutral chiefs. 

“The warfare thus continued as if it were one battle between 
the two cities, wherein thousands were sometimes killed in a day, 
and the casualties occasioned by the slain were supplied by fresh 
reinforcements from different parts. Some of the governors of the 
provinces took little share in these civil dissensions, hoping to make 
advantage of them, by becoming independent in the end”. 6 

This state of things continued for three years. In the mean¬ 
while Mallu Iqbal Khan, having quarrelled with Muqarrab Khan, 
deserted Sultan Mahmud Shah and joined the party of Nusrat Shah. 
But a few days later he formed a conspiracy against Nusrat Shah, 
who fled to Panipat and joined his wazlr Tatar Khan. Mallu, now 
in possession of Firfizabad, strove to expel Sultan Mahmud and 
Muqarrab Khan from the old city. At length, through the media¬ 
tion of some nobles, peace was concluded between the rival parties. 
But Mallu Iqbal, perfidious as he was, attacked Muqarrab Khan in 
his own house and killed him. Mallu then exercised royal authority 
in the name of Sultan Mahmud, who was deprived of all but the 
name of the king and became a mere tool in his hands. Mallu march¬ 
ed along with the pageant King from Delhi to Panipat, the head¬ 
quarters of Nusrat Khan and Tatar Khan. Tatar Khan evaded him, 
arrived at Delhi, and besieged it. In the meantime Mallu Khan 
captured Panipat and took possession of the baggage and elephants 
left there by Tatar Khan, and hastened back to Delhi. Thereupon 
Tatar Khan fled to his father Zafar Khan, who had practically as¬ 
sumed independence in Gujarat, while Nusrat Shah took refuge in 
the Doab. Mallu Iqbal entered Delhi in October 1398, but before 
he could settle down to restore order, news reached him that Timur 
(Tamerlane) had crossed the Sindhu, the Chenab, and the Ravi, and 
captured Tulamba and Multan. Before we trace the subsequent 
history of the Tughluqs it is necessary to go back a little to relate, 
from the very beginning, the invasion of Timur, which ultimately 
swept away the Tughluq dynasty, and put an end to the Turkish 
rule in India. 7

CHAPTER VII 


THE INVASION OF TIMUR AND THE END OF 
THE TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 

Timur was born in the year A.D. 1336 at the town called Kech 
or Shahr-i-sabz (green town) to the south of Samarqand in 
Transoxiana, that is, the territory between the rivers Oxus and 
Jaxartes. He belonged to a noble Turk family of the Barlas clan 
which ruled a small principality round the town of his birth. His 
original name was Timur, but once, in the course of a fight, he was 
wounded by an arrow in the leg and he limped for the rest of his 
life. Hence his Turkish enemies styled him “Aksak-Tlmur” (limp¬ 
ing Timur), and the Persians, “Tlmur-i-lang” (Timur the lame), 
corrupted by Europeans into Tamerlane. 

It is not necessary for our present purpose to relate the long 
life of warfare, led by Tamerlane, by which he rose from a humble 
position to be the ruler of a vast empire embracing in addition to 
Transoxiana and a part of Turkistan, the whole of Afghanistan, 
Persia, Syria, Qurdistan, and the major part of Asia Minor. To¬ 
wards the end of his career, he decided to undertake an expedition 
against India. He repeatedly declares in his autobiography 1 that 
his object in the invasion of Hindusthan was to lead an expedition 
against the infidels, and thereby become a Ghazi, or a martyr. 2 But 
in one or two places, he refers to the twofold objects of his expe¬ 
dition: “The first was to war with the infidels,” and thereby ac¬ 
quire “some claim to reward in the life to come”. The other was 
“that the army of Islam might gain something by plundering the 
wealth and valuables of the infidels”. 3 There can be no doubt that 
both the religious and the material aspects of the expedition were 
always present in his mind. As a matter of fact, he combined in 
himself the savage ferocity of Chinghlz Khan and the fanaticism 
of Sultan Mahmud. 

Before he launched his Indian expedition, information reached 
him that his grandson Pir Muhammad, the governor of Kabul, 
Qandahar, Ghazni and other neighbouring regions, had already sent 
an expedition against India, which crossed the river Sindhu, cap¬ 
tured Uch, and besieged Multan. Timur, on his part, started from 
Samarqand early in A.D. 1398 (March or April). When he reached 
Afghanistan, a large number of Muslims, both high and low, corn- 


116 


THE INVASION OF TIMUR AND THE END OF THE TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 


plained to him of the ill-treatment which they constantly received 
at the hands of the infidels of Kator and the Siyah-poshes, 4 and 
asked for his protection, which was readily assured. Timur him¬ 
self proceeded against Kator, which denoted the region between 
Kashmir and Kabul, and sent a detachment against the Siyah-poshes. 
The fort of Kator, deserted by the people, was levelled with the 
ground and the houses of the city were burnt. The infidels, who 
took refuge on the top of a hill, were defeated, and many of them 
put to death. Some of the infidels held out for three days, and 
Timur offered them the usual alternatives of ‘death’ or ‘Islam’. They 
chose the latter, but soon recanted, and attacked a regiment of 
Muslim soldiers during the night. But the latter were on their 
guard and killed a number of infidels and took 150 of them as 
prisoners “who were afterwards put to death by the enraged 
soldiery”. As soon as it was day, Timur ordered his troops to ad¬ 
vance on all four sides, “to kill all the men, to make prisoners 
the women and children, and to plunder and lay waste all their 
property”. When this order was faithfully executed, he “directed 
towers to be built on the mountain of the skulls of those obstinate 
unbelievers”. In order to let posterity know of this expedition 
“in the auspicious month of Ramazan, A.H. 800 ” (A.D. 1398 ), Timur 
engraved an account of it on a neighbouring hill and then proceeded 
to retrieve the disaster that had befallen the other part of his army 
which had been sent against the Siyah-poshes. 

Burhan Aglan, who was sent against them with 10,000 men, 
“was routed by, and fled from, a small number of infidels”. A small 
detachment of 400 men under Muhammad Azad, sent to his help, 
was attacked by the infidels, but he fought gallantly and after hav¬ 
ing recovered the horses and armour lost by Aglan, returned home¬ 
wards. Timur then advanced in person and captured some places 
but, as nothing more is said, presumably, after this, the Siyah- 
poshes were left alone. 15 

Timur then exterminated the “rebellious predatory tribes of 
the Agbanis” and crossed the Sindhu river in Sepember, 1398. He 
marched along the Jhelum and defeated several local chiefs, crossed 
this river below its junction with the Chenab, and reached Tulamba, 
which submitted without any fight. Here news reached him that 
Pir Muhammad had captured Multan. The two armies then joined, 
and after sending a part of his force by way of Dipalpur and Samana. 
Timur himself proceeded to Bhatnir, a strong fortified place occu¬ 
pied by Dul Chand, a Hindu chief, “famous throughout the whole 
country”. 


117 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The casus belli was furnished by the conduct of the chiefs and 
nobles of the city of Dipalpur who had tendered allegiance to Plr 
Muhammad, but later turned rebels and killed Musafir Kabuli, the 
governor appointed by him. On hearing of the approach of Timur 
the rebels took refuge in Bhatnir. What part, if any, the Hindu 
chief of Bhatnir played in the whole affair is not stated, but Timur 
invaded and easily conquered the city. The fort was guarded by 
a body of Rajputs who offered a stout resistance, but ultimately 
Dul Chand surrendered and presented himself to Timur. Timur 
then punished various refractory chiefs, specially the 500 refugees 
from Dipalpur, and “their w T ives and children were made slaves”. 
This fearful retribution filled Dul Chand’s brother and son with 
dismay, and they fled to the fort and closed its gate. But though 
they again submitted and were granted pardon, a dispute arose about 
the collection of ransom money “between the collectors and the 
evil-minded rais”. So Timur directed his “brave fellows to punish 
the infidels”, and what followed is described by him as follows:—- 
“In a short space of time all the people in the fort were put to the 
sword, and in the course of one hour the heads of 10,000 infidels 
were cut off. The sword of Islam was washed in the blood of the 
infidels, and all the goods and effects, the treasure and the grain 
which for many a long year had been stored in the fort became 
the spoil of my soldiers. They set fire to the houses and reduced 
them to ashes, and they razed the buildings and the fort to the 
ground”. 6 

Timur then captured the city of Sarsuti and the fearful scene 
was repeated. “All these infidel Hindus were slain, their wives and 
children were made prisoners, and their property and goods be¬ 
came the spoil of the victors”. Several thousand Hindu women 
and children, who were brought captive, became Muhammedans. 7 

Timur then proceeded against the Jats. Although they fled into 
the jungles, Timur pursued them there. He killed 2,000 Jats, cap¬ 
tured their wives and children, and plundered their cattle and pro¬ 
perty. 8 About this time, another part of Timur’s army which was 
following a more northerly route, joined him near Samana, and 
Timur marched via Fanipat towards Delhi. After reaching the 
neighbourhood of Delhi, he sent a force of cavalry in advance, with 
orders “to plunder and destroy and to kill every one whom they 
met”. They literally carried out this order, and reached the Jahan- 
numa palace, having, as they proceeded, ‘plundered every village, 
killed the men, and carried a number of Hindu prisoners, both 
male and female’. 9 Next day Timur crossed the river Yamuna and 
captured Loni on the other bank of the river. The people here 
were mostly Hindus. “Many of the Rajputs placed their wives and 


118 


THE INVASION OF TlIvlUR AND THE END OF THE TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 

children in their houses and burned them, then they rushed to the 
battle and were killed”. After this fort was captured, Timur gave 
orders “that the Musulman prisoners should be separated and saved, 
but that the infidels should all be despatched to hell with the 
proselytising sword”. 10 Sultan Mahmud of Delhi had hitherto taken 
no steps to oppose the invader, but now advanced with Mallu, and 
a battle was fought with a detachment of Timur near the Palace 
of Jahannuma (December 12 , 1398 ). The Sultan was defeated and 
fled with his army. 

A grim tragedy, perhaps unparalleled in the history of the 
world, was an indirect consequence of this battle. There were at 
this time about 100,000 Hindu prisoners in the camp of Timur. Two 
amirs reported to Timur that “on the previous day, when the 
enemy’s forces made the attack upon us, the prisoners made signs 
of rejoicing 1 , uttered imprecations against us, and were ready, as 
soon as they heard of the enemy’s success, to form themselves into 
a body, break their bonds, plunder our tents, and then to go and 
join the enemy, and so increase his numbers and strength”. Timur 
having asked their advice, “they said that on the great day of battle 
these 100,000 prisoners could not be left with the baggage, and that 
it would be entirely opposed to the rules of war to set these idolaters 
and foes of Islam at liberty. In fact, no other course remained but 
that of making them all food for the sword”. Timur thereupon 
resolved to put them all to death. He proclaimed “throughout the 
camp that every man who had infidel prisoners was to put them 
to death, and whoever neglected to do so should himself be exe¬ 
cuted and his property given to the informer. When this order be¬ 
came known to the ghazls of Islam, they drew their swords and put 
their prisoners to death. 100,000 infidels, impious idolaters, were 
on that day slain. Maulana Naslr-ud-dm ‘Umar, a counsellor and 
man of learning, who, in all his life, had never killed a sparrow, 
now, in execution of my order, slew with his sword fifteen ido¬ 
latrous Hindus, who were his captives”. 11 

On, December 17, there was a pitched battle outside Delhi. 
Timur defeated Sultan Mahmud and entered the city (December 18, 
1398). Both the Sultan and his minister Mallu fled, but a terrible 
fate was reserved for the people of Delhi. On learning “that great 
numbers of Hindus and gahrs, with their wives and children, and 
goods, and valuables had come into the city from all the country 
round”, Timur sent a force to seize them. But “many of them drew 
their swords and offered resistance.” “The flames of strife were thus 
lighted and spread through the whole city from Jahanpanah and 
Sirl to Old Delhi, burning up all it reached. The savage Turks 
fell to killing and plundering. The Hindus set fire to their houses 


119 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


with their own hands, burned their wives and children in them, 
and rushed into the fight and were killed.” The carnage, which 
continued, is thus described in the autobiography of Timur:— 

“On that day, Thursday, and all the night of Friday, nearly 
15,000 Turks were engaged in slaying, plundering, and destroying. 
When morning broke on the Friday, all my army, no longer under 
control went off to the city and thought of nothing but killing, 
plundering, and making prisoners. All that day the sack was 
general. The following day, Saturday, the 17th, all passed in the 
same way, and the spoil was so great that each man secured from 
fifty to a hundred prisoners, men, women, and children. There 
was no man who took less than twenty. The other booty was 
immense in rubies, diamonds, garnets, pearls, and other gems; 
jewels of gold and silver; ashrafls, tankas of gold and silver of the 
celebrated ‘Alai coinage; vessels of gold and silver; and brocades 
and silks of great value. Gold and silver ornaments of the Hindu 
women were obtained in such quantities as to exceed all account. 
Excepting the quarter of the saiyids, the ‘ulamd, and the other 
Musulmans, the whole city was sacked.” 12 

Timur disowns all responsibility for the terrible outrage and 
attributes it to the “spirit of resistance” displayed by the infidel 
inhabitants, and so, he exclaims: “By the will of God, and by no 
wish or direction of mine, all the three cities of Delhi. . .had been 
plundered.” 13 

After the sack of Delhi, Timur proceeded to the north (January 
1, 1399, and sent several contingents to kill the infidels on the 
Yamuna and the Ganga. It is needless to add details which 
would be mere repetitions. The progress of his armies was mark¬ 
ed by rapine, massacre, and plunder of the Hindus;—the adult 
males were slain; the children and women were taken prisoners, 
and were either converted into Islam or kept as slaves. After 
proceeding up to Siwalik Hills in the north, and devastating the 
countryside both on the right and the left, Timur turned to the 
west and captured and plundered Nagarkot and Jammu. He then 
proceeded homewards and re-crossed the Sindhu on March 19, 1399. 

On the eve of his departure from India, Timur held a court on 
March 6, and appointed Khizr Khan governor of Multan, Lahore, 
and Dlpalpur. 14 It is mentioned by some contemporary historians 
that Khizr was also nominated by him as his viceroy in Delhi. 

A historian has very correctly observed that Timur had inflict¬ 
ed “on India more misery than had ever before been inflicted by 
any conqueror in a single invasion.” 115 Although his avowed 


120 


THE INVASION OF TIMUR AND THE END OF THE TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 


object was to destroy the infidel Hindus and plunder their pro- 
perty 16 —and this ‘pious’ task he did to the best of his ability— 
it is hard to believe that he did not inflict miseries also on the 
Muslims in India. Reference may be made, for example, to 
Sulan Mahmud, Mallu, and their families and followers. On the 
whole, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that his professed zeal 
for the cause of Islam could not always get better of his lust for 
plunder and massacre, and that although he might not have deli¬ 
berately harmed the Muslims, as he did in the case of the Hindus, 
he would not scruple to do so whenever it was necessary in the 
course of his campaign, marked throughout by indiscriminate loot 
and plunder. 

After the departure of Timur, chaos and confusion prevailed 
over a large part of northern India. Delhi was almost depopulated 
and the few that remained were severely affected by famine and 
pestilence. “Many died of sickness and many of hunger. For a 
couple of months Delhi presented a scene of desolation and woe.” 17 
This miserable lot of the proud imperial city of the Muslim Sultans 
was brought about by one who regarded himself as the champion of 
that faith. 1 

The Empire also perished. Bengal, Deccan and Vijayanagara 
had already become independent before Timur’s invasion. Now 
Gujarat, Malwa and Jaunpur became powerful independent princi¬ 
palities, while Lahore, Dipialpur Multan, and parts of Sind were 
held by Khizr Khan on behalf of Timur. A large number of smaller 
independent principalities grew on all sides, such as Samana, 
Rayana, Kalpi, and Mahoba. 18 


As mentioned above, both Sultan Mahmud Shah as well as his 
minister Mallu had fled from Delhi after their defeat in the hands 
of Timfir. As soon as Timur left, Nusrat Shah, a pretender to the 
throne, who was once driven by Mallu, 19 occupied Delhi and 
declared himself as Sultan. Being, however, defeated and driven 
away by Mallu he proceeded to Mewat where he breathed his last. 
Mallu now administered Delhi and recovered control over some 
parts of the Doab. But as most of the provinces had now declared 
independence, the sovereignty exercised by Mallu was limited to 
a very narrow region round about Delhi. When Khvaja Jahan, 
ruler of Jaunpur, died and was succeeded by his adopted son, 
Mubarak Shah, Mallu made an attempt to recover Jaunpur, but 
failed. 


In A.D. 1401, Mallu invited the fugitive Sultan Mahmud Shah 
to Delhi. The Sultan had at first taken refuge with Muzaffar Shah, 
who was practically independent in Gujarat. The position of the 


121 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Sultan at his court was anomalous for though Muzaffar received him 
warmly, he did not accord to him the treatment and respect due to 
a sovereign. Mahmud therefore left Gujarat in disgust and 
proceeded to M'alwa where Dilavar Khan treated him with 
respect. On receiving the invitation of Mallu, the Sultan re¬ 
turned to Delhi, but was virtually a pensioner of Mallu. who 
administered the government in his name. Mallu once more 
tried to re-assert the authority of Delhi over Jaunpur and, accom¬ 
panied by the Sultan, proceeded towards Kanauj, where Ibrahim 
Shah, who had succeeded his brother Mubarak Shah, opposed him 
with a great force. The Sultan, chafing at the control of Mallu, 
fled to Ibrahim, but was very coldly received there. Thereupon he 
occupied Kanauj and resided there with a few attendants. Ibrahim 
allowed him to live in Kanauj, and Mallu returned discomfited to 
Delhi. 

Mallu made several attempts to recover some of the territories 
in the neighbourhood of Delhi, such as Gwalior and Etawa, but did 
not meet with much success. He then advanced against the Sultan, 
who shut himself up at Kanauj. Unable to reduce it, Mallu, along 
with the chief of Sam ana, marched towards Multan against Khizr 
Khan. An engagement took place near Ajudhan, and Khizr Khan 
defeated and killed Mallu. 

On Mallu’s death Mahmud Shah returned to Delhi, and Dau- 
lat Khan Lodi, an Afghan noble, was appointed military governor 
of the Doab. Actually Daulat Khan was the man who ruled the king¬ 
dom, and gained some success in re-asserting the authority of the 
Sultan over the neighbouring States. But Khizr Khan proved a 
powerful adversary, and annexed Sarnana, Sirhind, Sunam and 
Hissar. Mahmud Shah exercised authority only over the Doab, 
Rohtak and Sambal. In A.D. 1408 Mahmud Shah re-conquered 
Hissar, but next year Khizr Khan besieged Firuzabad, a few miles 
to the north of Delhi. Though he had to retire for want of provi¬ 
sions, he reduced Rohtak and ravaged the Doab. In A.D. 1410, he 
besieged Mahmud Shah in his capital city and captured Firuzabad. 
Once again, Khizr Khan was compelled to retire as the devastated 
country could not furnish enough supply for his army. At last, in 
A.D. 1412, 20 Sultan Mahmud Shah died. Thus ended his inglori¬ 
ous reign of about eighteen years, during which he was a fugitive 
more than once, and never exercised any real authority or power. 
The royal dynasty founded by Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq as well as the 
rule of the Turks in India ended with him. On his death, the 


122 


THE INVASION OF TIMUR AND THE END OF THE TUGHLUQ DYNASTY 

nobles of the court offered the throne to Daulat Khan Lodi, and he 
ascended the throne in A.D. 1413. Some of the chiefs who had 
joined Khizr Khan now took the side of Daulat Khan. Khizr Khan, 
who was supported by the amirs of Hissar Fluza, besieged Rohtak, 
and laid waste Sambal. He then proceeded to Delhi and invested 
the city. After a siege of four months Daulat Khan surrendered 
and was kept a prisoner at Hissar. Khizr Khan took possession of 
Delhi and founded the so-called Sayyid Dynasty (A.D. 1414). 

1. The account of Timur is based principally on his autobiographical memoir, 
entitled Malfuzat-i-Timurl or Tuzak-i-Timuri, translated in HIED , III. 389-477. 
The figures in the footnotes, unless otherwise stated, refer to the pages of this 
work. 

2. Pp. 394-5. He refers to the following verse of the Quran as his guide: “O 
Prophet, make war upon infidels and unbelievers, and treat them with severity.” 
Elsewhere he says: “My great object in invading Hindustan had been to wage 
a religious war against the infidel Hindus” (p. 429). 

3. P. 461. 

4. “The infidel Kators and the Siyah-poshes exact tribute and blackmail every 
year from us who are true believers, and if we fail in the least of our settled 
amount, they slay our men and carry our women and children into slavery”. It 
appears that the Muslim complaints practically amounted to the system of dis¬ 
traint for realising the arrears in rent or tribute (settled amount). The degree 
of severity was naturally exaggerated by them, particularly as it was imposed 
by the infidels on the true believers. This aspect of the case clearly emerges 
both from the address of the Muslims and the reply of Timur: “On hearing 
these words the flame of my zeal for Islam, and my affection for my religion,

military necessity, urged by Timur’s advisers, is an intriguing problem. A 
parallel, though on a very small scale, may be found in Napoleon’s action after 
the capture of Jaffa (March, 1799). Napoleon reluctantly issued orders to shoot 
2,500 or 3,000 prisoners, who were promised quarters without his knowledge 
and consent. As he ran short of provisions, and his soldiers refused to share 
the scanty supply with the Turks and Albanians, he could not keep them, nor 
could he send them to Egypt, there to spread discontent. Besides, the latter 
course would mean detaching a French battalion from his small army to escort 
the prisoners to Egypt. In spite of some apologists, who have made a halting 
defence on these and other grounds (Rose, The Life of Napoleon, Ch. IX, p. 204), 
Napoleon’s conduct has been condemned by many. It cannot be determined 
whether Timur’s difficulties were as serious as those of Napoleon. But Timur’s 
action differs from Napoleon’s in one important respect. Apart from the fact 
that the charge of treason was at best doubtful and contingent in character 
there is no doubt that religious bigotry played an important part. The Muslim 
prisoners were more likely to be sympathetic to the Muslim rulers with whom 
Timur fought. But yet only the Hindu prisoners were killed. If it is argued 
that there were no Muslim prisoners, then it would follow that throughout his 
long march, Timur either did not fight with any Muslims—which is absurd 
on the face of it—or did not make Muslims prisoners, following a discriminating 
policy against the Hindus even in this respect.

13. P. 447. Although Timur declares that he earnestly wished that “no evil might 
happen to the people of the place,” and apparently holds his soldiers responsible 
for the outrage, it must be remembered that it was he who had sent the soldiers 


123

to seize the Hindu fugitives, and this led to the conflagration. It is also difficult 
to believe that Timur could not restrain his soldiers during the three days of 
their orgy of murder and plunder.

CHAPTER VIII 


THE S4YYIDS 

I KHIZR KHAN 1 (A.D. 1414-21) 

According to the contemporary writer, Yahyia Sirhindl, author 
of the Tarikh-i-Mubdrak Shahi, Khizr Khan, the founder of the 
Sayyid dynasty, was descended from the Prophet of Islam, and was 
hence styled a Sayyid. Yahya, however, bases his conclusions on un¬ 
substantial evidence, namely, the testimony of the saint Jalal-uddin 
Bukhari, 1 and Khizr Khan’s noble character which distinguished him 
as the Prophet’s descendant. 2 It is likely that the family originally 
came from Arabia and settled in Multan where the governor, Malik 
Mardan Daulat, who was a man of pious disposition, 3 adopted Khizr 
Khan’s father, Malik Sulaiman, as his son. Malik Mardan was suc¬ 
ceeded by his son Malik Shaikh, and the latter by Malik Sulaiman, 
on whose death the governorship of Multan was conferred on Khizr 
Khan by Sultan Firuz Shah. Khizr Khan continued to hold this 
office until he was expelled from Multan in A.D. 1395 by Sarang Khan, 
brother of Mallu Iqbal Khan. 3a He escaped to Mewat 4 for a time, 
but re-emerged to cast his lot with Timur. The invader, before 
leaving the Indian capital, is believed to have appointed Khizr Khan 
his viceroy at Delhi, 5 but after his departure from the country, Khizr 
Khan was able to re-establish himself only in Multan, DIpalpur and 
parts of Sind. 6 He increased his power gradually and it has been 
related above how he first defeated and killed the usurper. Mallu 
Iqbal Khan, and then, having defeated Daulat Khan Lodi, entered 
Delhi in triumph on June 6, 1414. Immediately after defeating 
Daulat Khan he set about organizing the administration afresh by 
redistributing important offices of the state among his trusted follow¬ 
ers, treating kindly at the same time the nobles of Mahmud Tughluq’s 
reign. He also made liberal grants and endowments to the poor to 
help them in their resettlement. The capital thus recovered from the 
shock of political disorders and the sack by Timur that had preceded 
his accession to the throne. 

Khizr Khan held fast to the conviction that he owed his power 
and prestige to Timur’s patronage, and continued, therefore, his 
allegiance to the latter’s son, Shah Rukh, to whom he sent gifts and 
paid tribute throughout his reign. 6a He did not adopt the popular title 
of Shah (King) and preferred to be addressed as Rayat-i-ATa (Sublime 


125 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Banners). For three years he had only Shah Rukh’s name recited 
in public prayers, and in 1417 obtained the latter’s permission to have 
his own name also suffixed to that of Shah Rukh. 6b This acknowledge¬ 
ment of foreign supremacy was, as a matter of fact, quite formal, 
as it did not materially affect his position as an independent king. 7 
Likewise, Khizr Khan did not strike coins in his own name but, in 
order to secure their ready acceptance, he used the types of coins that 
had become popular in the immediate past by altering their dates. s 
This was, no doubt, meant to avoid a financial breakdown, but it also 
revealed his inherent weakness. By invoking the prestige of his 
Indian predecessors and that of a contemporary foreign potentate, 
Khizr Khan wished to buttress his position against the hostility of 
Turkish and Afghan nobles and the majority of his non-Muslim 
subjects. 

Politically, India was at that time split up into a number of 
independent States, and the Sultanate of Delhi had, long before the 
rise of the Sayyids, been considerably diminished in size and 
strength. Bengal and the Deccan were lost before the middle of 
the fourteenth century and this was followed by the emergence of 
independent kingdoms in Jaunpur, Malwa, Gujarat and Khandesh 
during the troublous times that marked the closing of the four¬ 
teenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century. A number of 
smaller chieftains in the Doab and adjacent areas also felt tempted 
to throw off their yoke of allegiance to Delhi. • The Sultanate 
having thus been deprived of important and rich territories, 
Khizr Khan’s precarious hold beyond Delhi extended over a 
portion of the Doab and Mewat. His limited resources did not allow 
him to undertake major campaigns for reconquering the territories 
that had previously seceded. He was able to recover only some 
fertile areas in the vicinity of Delhi and realize arrears of tribute 
from refractory chieftains. For this purpose his minister, Taj-ul- 
Mulk, led a series of expeditions directed mainly against the Rajput 
states of Katehr 9 and Etawa. Other places raided by him included 
Khor, Kampil, Pattiali, Jalesar, Gwalior and Bayana. 10 Every¬ 
where he gained temporary success and collected revenues, with¬ 
out, however, effecting permanent submission. Khizr Khan’s own 
visits to some of these places produced no better results. 

The Turkish elements were far from being reconciled to the 
rule of the new dynasty and, in spite of Khizr Khan’s conciliatory 
policy, they organized risings and plots which caused him consider¬ 
able embarrassment. In 1416, a group of Turkbachchas created 
trouble in Sirhind and assassinated Malik Sadhu Nadira, the deputy 
of Prince Mubarak who had been put in charge of its administra¬ 
tion. Royal armies defeated them and drove them into the moun- 


126 


THE SAYYIDS 


tains, but they rose again next year under their new leader, Tughan 
Rais, who was also defeated and, on promising to behave, was ap¬ 
pointed governor of Jullundur. Tughan, on recovering his strength, 
again attacked Sirhind but failing in the attempt, fled across the 
Sutlej, and effected a junction with the Khokhars whose incursions 
into the Punjab in the succeeding reign assumed threatening pro¬ 
portions. 

Another Turkish noble, Mahabat Khan, amir of Badaun, who 
had been apparently loyal, surprised Khizr Khan with his resistance 
in 1418 when the latter was returning from Katehr. The fort of 
Badaun was besieged and operations continued for about six months, 
but when success was almost in sight, Khizr Khan had suddenly 
to raise the siege on account of the treachery of some Turkish slaves. 
After arriving at Delhi he had the traitors, Qwam Khan and 
Ikhtiyar Khan, executed. Shortly afterwards in 1419 came the news 
of the rising in the Bajwara mountains of an impostor who posed 
as Sarang Khan, brother of Mailu Iqbal Khan. Sarang had expelled 
Khizr Khan from Multan in 1395 but had later been captured and 
carried away by Timur to Samarqand where he was executed. 10a The 
impostor was defeated by Khizr Khan’s capable general, Sultan Shah 
Lodi, and driven back into the mountains. Next year he was cap¬ 
tured by Tughan Rais who killed him in order to appropriate his 
wealth. 

The only distant campaign which Khizr Khan undertook was 
the one towards Nagaur 11 in 1416, on an appeal from its Muslim 
ruler against the aggression of Ahmad Shah of Gujarat, who with¬ 
drew, however, on the approach of the Delhi army. Nagaur tempo¬ 
rarily submitted to Khizr Khan but transferred its allegiance to 
Gujarat two years later under the threat of an invasion from 
Malwa. 12 During his return from Nagaur, Khizr Khan visited Gwa¬ 
lior and Bayana and realised customary payments. 

In the last year of his reign Khizr Khan raided Mewat and 
destroyed the fortress of Kotla. He then ravaged Gwalior and, after 
exacting tribute, came to Etawa where the new Raja offered his 
submission and usual payments. He fell ill during the campaign 
and after returning to Delhi, died on May 20, 1421. 

Khizr Khan possessed laudable traits of character which won 
him the affection of the people. He was wise, just and benevolent, 
and was free from the vices common in those days. His record as 
a ruler was not, however, impressive. The conquest of Delhi, after 
numerous set-backs, was a creditable achievement, but he proved 
incapable of settling the problems of a country which had been 
plunged into virtual anarchy after Timur’s invasion. During the 


127 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


seven years that he ruled over Delhi, he tried to restore the prestige 
of the Sultanate in the Punjab, the Doab, Rohilkhand and parts of 
Rajputana, but the kingdom which he founded was no better than 
many other independent ones which had sprung up all over the sub¬ 
continent after the decline of the Tughluq power. The odds against 
him proved to be too great to allow him to achieve anything sub¬ 
stantial. 

II. MUBARAK SHAH (A.D. 1421-34) 

Khizr Khan was succeeded by his son Mubarak 13 who, unlike the 
former, did not hesitate to adopt the title of Shah and have the 
khutba read in his own name. He issued coins also, 14 although for 
the first eight years of his reign he followed his father’s example of 
using coins that were current in the past by merely altering the 
dates on them. 

The newly founded Sayyid kingdom was threatened under 
Mubfarak Shah with danger from all sides. In the north and west 
the triple menace of the Khokhars, the Turkbachchas and the 
Mughuls created an alarming situation, while in the south and east, 
the kings of Malwa and Jaunpur were anxiously awaiting their 
chance for aggressive expansion. Mubarak rose equal to the occa¬ 
sion and, by fighting incessantly almost throughout his reign, he was 
able to preserve his kingdom intact without, however, adding any 
new territories to it. 

The Khokhars lived in the Punjab, mostly in the valleys of the 
Jhelum and the Chenab, 115 and constantly raided the surrounding 
territories. During Khizr Khan’s regin they had not been very ac¬ 
tive, but now their indomitable leader, Jasrath, made desperate 
attempts to overthrow the Sayyids. He received some help from 
Sultan Zain-ul- 4 Abidin of Kashmir 16 and, making good use of his 
alliance with Tughan Rais Turkbachcha, raided Jullundur early in 
Mubarak’s reign. He advanced as far as Sirhind, but was checked 
by the stubborn opposition of Islam Khan Lodi. Thereafter Sultan 
Mubarak Shah personally marched from Delhi and, by vigorous 
counter-attacks, drove him back across the Chenab into his hilly 
resort of Tekhar. 17 In 1422, Jasrath twice raided Lahore and some 
other areas but withdrew each time on the approach of royal armies. 
He remained apparently quiet for the next five years but is be¬ 
lieved to have been secretly in touch with Shaikh ‘All, the Mughul 
deputy governor of Kabul, 18 whom he wished to undertake an 
attack on Siwastan, Bhakkar and Tattah, so that a diversion of 
Mubarak Shah’s armies in that direction might facilitate his own 
movements towards Delhi. The plan did not, however, succeed and, 


128 


THE SAYYIDS 


when Jasrath attacked Kalanaur and Jullundur in A.D. 1428, Malik 
Sikandar Tuhfa, by a heroic action, forced him back to Tekhar. Later 
in the year the Mughul invasion took place, and a contingent of 
Khokhars under ‘Ain-ud-dm and Malik Abu-’l-Khair joined the in¬ 
vaders at Talwara to guide them onwards. Jasrath, availing himself 
of this chance, attacked Jullundur again and defeated Malik Tuhfa 
whom he carried away as a prisoner. 19 He then marched to Lahore 
but on the arrival of reinforcements from Delhi under Sarvar-ul- 
Mulk, he retreated to the hills. Another attempt on Lahore about six 
months later proved equally futile, and Jasrath was finally exhaust¬ 
ed with a last heavy raid on Jullundur. Nothing further was re¬ 
ported during Mubarak’s reign, but in 1436, his successor Muhammad 
Shah sent an expedition against Jasrath and later asked Buhifil 
Lodi, then governor of Sirhind, to suppress him. The wily Khokhar 
chief, realizing, however, that the rise of Lodi power in the Punjab 
had made it impossible for him to conquer Delhi, hastened to make 
peace w T ith Buhlul urging the latter to oust the Sayyids and occupy 
Delhi. 19a He did not, however, live see the fruition of his plan, 
for, in A.D. 1442, he was murdered by his queen to avenge the death 
of her father, Rai Bhilam. 20 

Another insurrection, which appeared less significant at first 
but led to serious development afterwards, was headed by Pulad 
'Turkbacheha. He was a slave of Shaikh Salim who held under 
Khizr Khan the district of Sarsuti, Amroha and several pargands in 
the Doab in addition to the fort of Tabarhindah, 21 where he had 
collected a large treasure and a huge store of grain and provi¬ 
sions. After the Shaikh’s death early in A.D. 1430, Mubarak 
Shah bestowed all his lands on his two sons who did not, however, 
seem to be satisfied with their lot, and for ulterior motives incited 
Pulad to revolt. 22 Pulad, who was keen to advance his own inter¬ 
ests, entered the fort of Tabarhindah about the middle of the year 
and, appropriating all of his late master’s wealth, raised the standard 
of revolt. Mubarak Shah, on discovering the complicity of the 
Shaikh’s sons, ordered their arrest, and sent two of his officers, with 
some force, to treat with the rebel and recover the treasure. Pulad 
engaged them in negotiations and, after feigning friendliness, deli¬ 
vered a surprise attack at night and defeated them They retreated 
hurriedly to Sarsuti leaving behind all their baggage and equip¬ 
ment which added to the rebel’s strength. When the Sultan heard 
of their discomfiture, he set out immediately for Tabarhindah, but 
stopped at Sarsuti, from where he sent an army to besiege the fort. 
He also called Tmad-ul-Mulk, governor of Multan, to join him. 
Pulad, who had taken precautions to defend himself, however, sent 
word that he would agree to surrender if Tmad-ul-Mulk were sent 

129 

D.S.—9 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to assure him of his safety. This was arranged, but on learning 
secretly that he was being deceived, he reaffirmed his resolve to 
resist. Mubarak Shah, instead of forcing the rebel to surrender by 
intensifying the pressure on him, acted unwisely in slackening the 
operations against him. He sent back Tmad-ul-Mulk to Multan and 
himself returned to Delhi, leaving the other amirs, Islam Khan, 
Kamal Khan and Rai Flruz, to continue the siege which dragged on 
for about six months. 

The interval gave Pulad time to arrange for help from other 
quarters, and he sent his agents to Kabul invoking Shaikh ‘All’s help 
by promising a large sum of money in return. The latter responded 
favourably and, in February-March 1431, crossed into the Punjab. 
Advancing towards Tabarhindah, he attacked on his way the fiefs 
of Rai Flruz who was compelled to abandon the siege immediately 
without even informing his other colleagues. Islam Khan and 
Kamal Khan behaved similarly, for, when Shaikh ‘All was ten miles 
from Tabarhindah, the besiegers had all dispersed. Pulad came 
out to receive Shaikh ‘All, presented him a sum of 200,000 tankahs 
and entrusted his family to him for being carried to safety. The 
latter then went away to plunder other districts, while Pulad, thus 
relieved of danger, freely ravaged the country around and killed 
Rai Flruz. Mubarak Shah marched out again at the close of the 
year, but he remained so much pre-occupied with the affairs of 
Lahore that he could not visit Tabarhindah. In September 1432, 
he despatched another force to besiege the fort, but it had to be 
again withdrawn to meet fresh Mughul attacks. It was not until 
after the Mughul invader had been finally expelled that the siege 
of Tabarhindah was pressed on with vigour. By October 1433, the 
fort at last fell and Pulad was slain. 

Mughul incursions into Indian territory during the latter part 
of Mubarak’s reign constituted perhaps the most vital danger to the 
kingdom of Delhi. The attacks which were led by Shaikh ‘All, 
deputy governor of Kabul on behalf of Mas‘ud MIrza, grandson of 
Shah Rukh, are held by Firishta to have been the outcome of un¬ 
friendly relations between Mubarak and Shah Rukh, presumably 
because of Mubarak’s inclination towards complete independence. 
Since contemporary evidence suggests that the governor of Lahore 
continued making some sort of a payment, bribe or tribute, 
to Kabul up to the time of Shaikh ‘All’s invasion, and that Shah 
Rukh favoured Mubarak as well as his successor Muhammad Shah 
with robes of honour and umbrella etc. usually sent to a vassal, it 
is doubtful if Shaikh ‘All’s invasions had been authorized by Shah 
Rukh himself. 223 The operations appear to have been independently 


130 


THE SAYYIDS 


undertaken by Shaikh ‘All with the sanction of Mas‘ud MIrza, 
governor of Kabul and Ghazni. 

The earliest reports of Shaikh ‘All’s movement towards Bhakkar 
and Sewistan were received in 1423, but no details are available 
of the actual raid which was presumably of no consequence. It 
was in 1431 that he actually launched an invasion which helped to 
raise the siege of Tabarhindah, described above. Thereafter he 
ravaged the areas of Juliundur, FIruzpur and Lahore where the gov¬ 
ernor, Sikandar Tuhfa, offered him the customary payment. March¬ 
ing through DIpalpur, without resistance, he came to Multan where 
the toughest battle was fought and the invader was signally defeated 
by the royal forces under ‘Imad-ul-Mulk. The retreating Mughul 
army was pursued up to Seor, 23 but the royal army returned without 
dislodging Amir Muzaffar, Shaikh ‘All’s nephew, from the fort. It 
was a mistake on Mubarak’s part to have halted operations at this 
point. Perhaps a greater blunder was to remove ‘Imad-ul-Mulk 
from Multan, a fact which induced Shaikh ‘All to attack Multan 
again within four months. Mubarak was at the time seriously pre¬ 
occupied with the Khokhars and the coincidence suggests that 
Shaikh ‘All was in league with Jasrath. In November 1431, Shaikh 
‘All plundered Khospur and Tulamba, and committed terrible atro¬ 
cities on the inhabitants. Mubarak was in a grave predicament on 
account of the simultaneous risings of Pulad and Jasrath, but when 
he marched towards Samana, fortunately for him, his enemies be¬ 
gan to disperse. Jasrath returned to Tekhar, Pulad withdrew into 
the fort, and Shaikh ‘All retired to Bartot. 24 After a few months, 
however, the Mughul adventurer re-appeared at Lahore and merci¬ 
lessly sacked the town. When the situation had deteriorated consi¬ 
derably, Mubarak moved forward towards DIpalpur with a big army 
reinforced by ‘Imad-ul-Mulk and Islam Khan. Shaikh ‘All, finding 
himself unable to oppose the combined force, ran away hurriedly, 
leaving behind all his baggage. His nephew, Amir Muzaffar of Seor, 
also negotiated peace with Mubarak and gave his daughter in mar¬ 
riage to the Sultan’s adopted son, Muhammad Shiah. Shaikh ‘All 
did not come again, and Mubarak was able to save India from 
Mughul occupation for nearly a century. 

The relations of Mubarak Shah with Ibrahim, the Sharql ruler 
of Jaunpur, remained unhappy throughout his reign. Their inter¬ 
ests clashed over Bayana, Kalpi and Mewat, and the simmering 
hostility ultimately led to an open clash. Amir Khan AuhadI, ruler 
of Bayana, resisted Mubarak Shah in 1423; he was, however, forced 
to surrender, but allowed to retain his fief. His successor, Muham¬ 
mad KhJan, revolted again, but was defeated and brought to Delhi, 
from where he escaped and re-occupied his fort. On Mubarak’s 


131 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


advance Pie ran away and joined Ibrahim Sharql, who was march¬ 
ing forth to seize Kalpi. This small principality owed nominal allegi¬ 
ance to Delhi from which it was separated by Etawa. Its ruler, 
Qadir Khan, rightfully sought Mubarak’s help, but Ibrahim, in order 
to interrupt communication between Delhi and Kalpi, sent his 
brother Mukhtass Khan to occupy Etawa. This attempt was 
frustrated by the timely arrival of Mubarak’s general Mahmud 
Hasan (later called Tmad-ul-Mulk) who expelled Mukhtass imme¬ 
diately. Thereupon Ibrahim changed his plans and turned round 
to meet Mubarak. The two armies were pitched against each other 
near Bayana along the river Kanbhir where, after skirmishing for 
twenty-two days, a heavy but indecisive battle was fought on 
March 24, 1428, which led to Ibrahim’s sudden retreat. In the fol¬ 
lowing May, Mubarak reconquered Bayana and appointed Mahmud 
Hasan to settle its affairs. There was quiet for some years, but 
towards the close of Mubarak’s reign, Ibrahim set out again to cap¬ 
ture Kalpi, where he found a stronger rival in Hushang Shah of 
Malwa who was marching from the opposite direction. Mubarak 
prepared to intervene, but was suddenly assassinated. Meanwhile, 
Hushang succeeded in annexing Kalpi, and Ibrahim Sharql returned 
disappointed. 

Mewat or the country of the Meos, a spacious area to the south 
of Delhi including the districts of Mathura, Gurgaon, and parts of for¬ 
mer states of Alwar and Bharatpur, was a notorious abode of rebels 
and a source of constant trouble to the kings of Delhi. It was ruled 
by the line of Khanzadahs, founded by Bahadur Nahir, mentioned 
above, who wielded considerable power during the days of the later 
Tughluqs. Almost throughout Mubarak’s reign Mewat remained un¬ 
settled and rebellious. The first insurrection in 1425 was crushed 
with ‘fire and sword’, but only a year later the Mewatis rose again 
under their twin leaders Jalal Khan and ‘Abdul Qadir, nick-named 
Jallu and Qaddu, grandsons of Nahir. Severe punishment was in¬ 
flicted again, and while Jallu disappeared, Qaddu was arrested and 
after some time put to death, for being secretly in touch with 
Ibrahim Sharql. This compelled Jallu to come out again. He car¬ 
ried on resistance for some time but ultimately surrendered to 
Mubarak’s minister, Sarvar-ul-Mulk, on terms of paying tribute. 
When the Sultan visited Mewat in 1432, Jallu turned hostile again, 
but, finding the security afforded by his small fortress of little 
value against the pressure of royal troops, he submitted once more 
on the usual promise of paying tribute. 

There were a number of minor expeditions but they need not 
be dwelt upon at length. Mahabat Khan, Amir of Badaun, who had 
resisted Khizr Khan, submitted to Mubarak voluntarily. Katehr 


132 



THE SAYYIDS 


was raided twice in 1422 and 1424 and tribute was exacted. The 
Raja of Etawa, who had surrendered in 1422, later became scared 
and shut himself in the fort. The Sultan compelled him to yield 
again and, in addition to the payment of dues, also had his son 
sent to the court as a hostage. Gwalior was visited by royal forces a 
number of times. In 1423 Mubarak saved it from the aggressive 
attack of Hushang Shah of Malwa who was driven off after a battle. 
The Raja was, however, irregular in paying his tribute to Mubarak 
and no less than three times, in 1427, 1429 and 1432, expeditions 
had to be organised to realize the arrears due from him. 

In the fourteenth year of his reign Mubarak fell a victim to a 
treacherous conspiracy hatched by his chief minister Sarvar-ul-Mulk 
to avenge an alleged wrong. Sarvar v/as a Hindu convert, originally 
named Malik Sarup, who v/as appointed governor of the city of 
Delhi by Khizr Khan. He retained this office after Mubarak’s acces¬ 
sion but when the chief minister, Sikandar Tuhfa, v/as sent to 
Lahore in 1422 to help Mahmud Hasan in defeating Jasrath Khokhar, 
Sarvar managed to have himself appointed chief minister, while 
his son Yusuf succeeded to the governorship of Delhi. Towards the 
close of his reign Mubarak found that Sarvar, apart from being 
haughty and arrogant, had not been very efficient in carrying out 
his duties. The Sultan did not think it expedient to dismiss him, 
but in 1433 divested him of the work pertaining to revenue which 
was entrusted to Kamal-ul-Mulk, deputy-commander of royal forces, 
w r ho had recently come into prominence. Sarvar continued to hold 
the charge of political affairs, but he took the bifurcation of the 
offices of diwan and wazlr as a personal insult, and decided to put 
a violent end to Mubarak’s rule. His chief accomplices were Kankii 
and Kaju Khatri who had enjoyed royal favour for long, Mir an 
Sadar, deputy to the chief secretary and Qazi ‘Abdul Samad, the 
royal chamberlain. An opportunity soon presented itself when the 
Sultan, on his way to Kalpi, turned aside to visit his newly founded 
city of Mubarakabad. There, on February 19, 1434, as he was en¬ 
tering for his Friday prayers, Sidh Pal, grandson of Kaju, and 
Ranu the Black, basely murdered him in the precincts of the mosque. 

Mubarak Shah proved to be the ablest king of the house of 
Khizr Khan. He endeavoured his best to preserve his father’s gains 
and exhibited qualities of a brave warrior in overcoming the dangers 
that threatened his kingdom both from within and without. He was 
v/ise and resourceful, and had always at his disposal a loyal army 
of his own and that of his feudal allies which kept a watch on the 
important border posts of Lahore, Dlpalpur and Multan in the north 
and west, and fought to maintain his position at strategic points in 
the south and east. He did not, however, display similar shrewd 


133 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ness in the choice and treatment of his ministers and officers, and 
his mistrust of some of them, resulting in frequent transfers of 
holders of key-positions, produced disastrous consequences which 
contributed to his tragic end. He was just and kind towards all 
of his subjects, and even though a firm Muslim in belief and action, 
was free from the taint of bigotry. He patronized the Khatris of 
Delhi although some of them joined the plot against his life. He 
saved the Hindu state of Gwalior from Hushang’s aggression as 
keenly as he protected KalpI against Ibrahim SharqI’s designs. 
Likewise, his treatment of Katehr and Etawa was perhaps far from 
severe as compared with the merciless sack of Mewat and the coer¬ 
cion of Bayana. Mubarak’s architectural activity is evidenced by 
the founding of the new city of Mubarakabad in 1433 on the banks 
of the Yamuna with a big mosque. He also extended patronage to 
the contemporary chronicler, Yahya Sirhindl, whose well known 
work, the Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shate, forms the most authoritative 
source of the history of the period. 

III. MUHAMMAD SHAH (A.D. 1434-45) 

After Mubarak Shah’s death his brother’s son, Muhammad Khan 
bin Farid Khan, ascended the throne and styled himself Sultan 
Muhammad Shah. 25 For about six months all power was usurped 
by Sarvar-ul-Mulk who had received the title of Khan-i-Jahan. He 
began to uproot the old nobles who organized a stiff resistance under 
the leadership of Kam!al-ul-Mulk. Bayana was the first to revolt 
and its fief-holder, Yusuf Khan AuhadI, killed the Khatri, Ranu 
the Black, whom Sarvar had sent to take over the fort. This was 
followed by a general revolt of the outlying fief-holders who pooled 
their strength. Kamahul-Mulk cleverly concealed his hostility to 
Sarvar and feigned loyalty so that he was appointed the commander 
of royal forces, and sent to suppress the revolt. He proceeded 
quietly and halted at Ahar, where the rebel amirs, on receiving a 
hint of Kamal’s real intentions, came and joined him in May 1434. 
Their united force marched towards Delhi to punish the regicides. 
The success of Kamal’s plan lay in depriving Sarvar of the support 
of the Delhi army, and the latter, finding himself thus outdone, made 
an attempt also on the new king’s life, but was immediately killed 
by the body-guards who surrounded Muhammad Shah. All of his 
companions met the same fate. Thereafter the liberating army, 
which had besieged the city for about three months, was welcomed 
into Delhi, and all the nobles renewed their allegiance to Muhammad 
Shah. Kamal-ul-Mulk was appointed the chief minister. 

Muhammad Shah, freed from the control of Sarvar, became the 
sovereign de facto. As the nobles were united in supporting him, 


134 


THE SAYYIDS 


he had an excellent opportunity of reorganizing the affairs of the 
kingdom, but he soon disappointed everyone by his neglect of kingly 
duties and his desire for leisure and pleasure. The result was dis¬ 
order all round, and as it grew worse, the Mewati leader Jalal Khan 
and his companions, together with the elite of Delhi, sent an invi¬ 
tation to Sultan Mahmud Khalji of Malwa who encamped within 
ten miles of Delhi at a place called Talpat. Muhammad Shah, 
unable to defend himself, called in Buhlul Lodi, the chief of Sir- 
hind, to his aid. Buhlul came with 20,000 mounted soldiers and 
fought in the vanguard of the imperial army as its virtual com¬ 
mander. 26 The battle at the end of the first day remained inconclu¬ 
sive, but Muhammad Shah, without consulting any of his amirs, 
sent emissaries for peace the very next morning. The Khalji 
monarch who, during the intervening night, had been upset by a 
vision of disturbance at his own capital, 27 welcomed the proposal 
and withdrew immediately to Mandu. Buhlul, to whom Muhammad 
Shah’s decision was distasteful, retrieved the prestige of his own 
soldiers and that of the Delhi army by treacherously attacking the 
rear of the Khalji forces, killing some men and capturing baggage. 
The imbecile Sultan joined the chrous of praise for Buhlul by call¬ 
ing him a son and conferring on him the title of Khan-i-Khanan. 
He later on acquiesced in Buhlul’s occupation of the major part of 
the Punjab and asked him to coerce the still unsubdued Khokhar 
rebel, Jasrath, who was, however, shrewd enough to accommodate 
matters with Buhlul. The Lodls had, by now, immensely increased 
their power and Buhlul launched an attack on Delhi in 1443 but 
did not suceed. 

The last few years of Muhammad Shah’s reign witnessed the 
rapid decline of his kingdom. Multan became an independent king¬ 
dom. The Sharqls annexed some parganas in the east; numerous 
fief-holders withheld payment of tribute, and even some amirs with¬ 
in an area of twenty miles of Delhi began to assert independence. 
A short while before his death in 1445, 28 Muhammad Shah called 
from Badaun his son ‘Ala-ud-dm whom he nominated as his successor. 

IV. ‘ALA-UD-DIN ‘ALAM SHAH (A.D. 1445-51) 

‘Ala-ud-dm, who adopted the high-sounding title of ‘Alam 
Shah, 29 was perhaps the most unworthy king of his line. The only 
notable event of his reign was the transfer of power from the 
Sayyids to the Lodls, an act which was more formal than real, for 
Buhlul already held more extensive territories than his nominal 
suzerain could claim. The Sultanate of Delhi had practically ceased 
to exist, and its place had been taken by petty tribal kingdoms 


135 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


whose boundaries verged on the borders of Delhi. ‘Alam Shah, 
who was morally perverse, realizing his inability to bring back 
into submission the rebellious amirs, retired to Badaun where he 
gave himself up to pleasure and enjoyment. This created a vacuum 
at Delhi which was soon to be filled. Buhlul Lodi had, even before 
‘Alam Shah’s departure, made a second unsuccessful attack on Delhi 
in 1447. His opportunity at last came when 'Alam Shah’s minister, 
Hamid Khan, apprehending the forcible occupation of Delhi by some 
powerful neighbouring monarch, 30 invited, of his own accord, Buhlul 
Lodi and Qiyam Khan of Nagaur 31 either of whom, he believed, 
would agree to play the puppet king while he retained all power 
as wazTr. Buhlul, being nearer at Sirhind, rushed in at once, and 
Qiyam Khan, who was yet on his way to Delhi, returned disappoint¬ 
ed. Buhlul treacherously got rid of Hamid Khan after some time 32 
and informed ‘Alam Shah of his assumption of power, allowing the 
latter, however, to retain Badaun for the remainder of his life. 33 


1. He was the grandfather of the well-known divine, Sayyid Jalal, popularly 
called Makhdumd-Jahaniyan Jahan Gasht. He came from Bukhara to Bhakkar 
and ultimately went to Uchh where he died. See ‘Abdul Haqq: Akhbar-al- 
Akhydr (Delhi Ed. p. 60). 

2. Some of his virtues are thus enumerated in the TM (p. 182). “He was gene¬ 
rous, brave, gentle, kind, humble, true to his promise, temperate and God¬ 
fearing.” Badauni ( Muntakhab, I. p. 295), enlarging upon it, writes: “The 
Sayyid is a man in whom are manifest the virtues of Muhammad (peace be 
upon him) and the grace of ‘All, the accepted.” 

3. His original name was Khvaja Zia-ud-dln and he was a descendant of the 
famous saint, Khvaja ‘Abdullah Harvl. He migrated from Herat to India in 
A.D- 1353, and came to the court of Firuz Shah Tughluq who bestowed on 
him the title of Malik Mardan Daulat and the governorship of Multan to reward 
him for his services during the Bengal campaign. Mir’di-i-Jahdn Numa, 
Cambridge MS. f. 141b. 

3a. See above, Ch. VI, p. 113. 

4. According to the Zafar Ndma by Yazdi and other original accounts of Timur’s 
invasion, Khizr Khan had sought asylum at Bayana. Yahya Sirhindi, however, 
states that he went to Mewat. 

5. Mughul historians omit any reference to this nomination which is, however, 
confirmed by the contemporary writers Yahya, Sirhindi and Muhammad 
Bihamad Khanl. See TM 166, and Tdrikh-i-Muhammadi B.M- MS. f. 306b. 

6. According to Firishta, he occupied Lahore also. Cf. p. 124, n. 14. 

6a. See Maila’us-Sa‘dain, Vol. II, Part I, p. 342. 

6b. He sent a special envoy to Shah Rukh’s court for this purpose. See Tdrikh-i- 
Hcifiz Abril B.M. MS f. 291-2 and MatWus-SrTdain, II (i) 342. 

7. Nur-ul-Haqq, the author of the “Zubdat-ai-Tawdrikii ”, made it very clear; 
“Although he did not assume royal titles, yet he ruled and administered his 
territories like a king.” See Lahore MS. p. 54. 

8. Edward Thomas has compared it to a system “which the East India Company 
imitated of their own free will, with much credit and simplicity, by striking 
their rupees in the name of Shah ‘Alam and other defunct monarchs of Delhi 
whose money had of old obtained good repute in the local Bazars.” ( Chronicles 
of the Pathan Kings of Delhi , 330). 

9. Later known as Kohilkhand. 

10. Khor and Kampil—both in the Farrukhabad district, U.P.; Pattiali in the Etah 
district.

THE SAYYIDS 


12. Sultan Hushang Shah of Malwa, who was then preparing to invade Gujarat, had 
called upon Firuz Khan Dandani, ruler of Nagaur, to join him and promised the 
territory of Naharwalla in return for the latter’s aid. Firuz Khan, however, 
appeared unwilling to side with him and preferred to get in touch with Sultan 
Ahmad of Gujarat. 

13. His full name was Mu‘izz-ud-din and he styled himself as Sultan Mubarak Shah. 

14. They bore the title, Naib-i-Amir al-Mu’minin, which he probably assumed to 
strengthen his legal position as some previous Turkish Sultans had done. 

15. Particularly the districts of Jhang, Shahpur and Jhelum. A smaller number of 
them was also scattered over the districts of Lahore and Sialkot. 

16. The story that he also waylaid Sultan ‘AH king of Kashmir, on the latter’s 
return from Tattah is incredible, as none of the kings of Kashmir ever invaded 
lower Sind. Hodivala considers Tattah to be an error either for Tatta Kuti, a 
mountain pass in Kashmir or for Tibet. ( Studies in Indo-Muslim History, 402-3). 

17. Possibly a village called Thakkar in the Gujarat district, West Pakistan, about 
13 miles from the Chenab to the western side. 

18. His contact with the Mughuls is confirmed by a casual reference in the TM. 
(p. 201) to the fact that during Jasrath’s second raid on Lahore in 1422, when 
he ravaged DIpalpur also, there was a small contingent of Mughuls united to the 
Khokhar force. 

19. He managed to escape after some time and joined Mubarak S-hah when the latter 
was marching in pursuit of Shaikh ‘Ali. 

19a. See Ma‘dan-i-Akhbcir-i-Alimadi, Vol. I, B.M. MS. f. 144b. 

20. Rai Bhilam had assisted royal troops sent against Jasrath in 1422. After a short 
time however, Jasrath engaged the Rai in battle and killed him. TM. 201. 

21. Probably modern Bhatinda. [The identification has been discussed in Vol. V, 
p. 115, n. 2, Ed.] 

22. The contemporary writer Yahya Sirhindi is silent as to the real motive of the 
two brothers or that of Pulad. Haig (CHI, III. 216) writes that the Shaikh’s sons 
were anxious to get back their father’s wealth, which, according to Firishta, 
however, they had already been allowed to inherit. They were confident, adds 
Firishta, that they would be deputed by the king to supress Pulad and might 
then get a chance of leading a general rebellion for their personal aggrandizement. 

22a. See Tdrikh-i-Muhammadi, B.M. MS. f. 311-12; Majamihd-Akhbdr, I.O. MS., 
f. 333b; TM, 218. 

23. Modem Shorkot. 

24. Identified as Marwat in the Bannu district (Hodivala: Studies in Indo-Muslim 
History, 409). 

25. Some writers have wrongly described him as Mubarak’s son. 

26. The nominal command had been entrusted to Prince ‘Ala-ud-dln as Muhammad 
Shah did not take the field himself. Mahamud Khaljl also sent forth his two sons 
to lead the troops and held back himself. 

27. See Ma’asir-i-Mahmud Shdhi. Bodleian MS- f. 113B. He is also believed to 
have feared an attack on Malwa from Gujarat. See Tdrikh-i-Haqqi, Cambridge 
MS., p. 67, TA, III, 322, Muntakhah (Hasan Khaki) Eton MS. fol. i40a. 

28. There is some controversy about the date of Muhammad Shah death which the 
TA (Calcutta Text, Vol. I. p. 292) states as 847 A.H. (A.D. 1443-4), while the 
Tarlkh-i-Firishta (Bombay Text, Vol. I, p. 313) gives 849 A.H. (A.D. 1445-8). 
The numismatic evidence, is, however, conclusively in favour of 849 A.H. (H. N. 
Wright: The Coinage andl Metrology of the Suitans of Delhi, pp. 236, 241). 
Ishwari Prasad considers 849-50 A.H. as the correct date ( History of Mediaeval 
India, 1948 ed., p. 483, f.n. 14). Both Wright and Prasad have, however, made an 
error in quoting the TM. to support the date which is otherwise correct. They 
have overlooked the fact that this contemporary work on the Sayyids covers only 
one year of Muhammad Shah’s reign and concludes its account on 8 Rajab, 
838 A.H. (February 7, 1435). Probably they have relied upon Dowson’s transla¬ 
tion of TM in Volume IV of HIED (p. 88), where, after 838 A.H., the extracts 
to complete the narrative of the Sayyid Dynasty have been borrowed from the 
TA. The MS. of the TA., used by Dowson, unfortunately, had 844 A.H. as the 
date of Muhammad Shah’s death, and Dowson, considering it obviously wrong, 
changed it into 849 A.H. remarking in the foot-note that he borrowed the latter 
date from Firishta. Prasad has, in addition, ascribed to Muhammad Shah a 
reign of 13 years, 3 months and 16 days which is, in fact, the period of Mubarak 
Shah’s region. For this also he has quoted the TM, in support, remarking further 
that it thus corroborated Firishta’s statement. As noticed above, the TM, ends 
with the year 838 A.H., while according to Firishta, Muhammad Shah reigned 

137 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


for 12 years and some months. Hodivala supports 849 A.H. as the date of 
Muhammad Shah’s death, but has made a mistake, probably through oversight, 
in the last sentence of his note which reads: “Mubarak Shah really reigned for 
twelve years” (Studies in Indo-Muslim History , 410). It should be Muhammad 
Shah and not Mubarak Shah. 

29. Literally meaning ‘Lord of the World’, although the ridiculous extent of his 
territories was commonly expressed in the following epigram: Pddshdhi-yi-Shah- 
i-alam az Dehli td Pdlam, Ttirikh-i~Dd’udi, Lahore, P.U.MS. f. 7b. “The Kingdom 
of the Lord of the World extends from Delhi to Palam.” Palam is a village about 
twelve miles south of Delhi, near the site of the present civil aerodrome which is 
named after it- [In CHI, III. (p- 205), this epigram' is taken to refer to the last 
Tughluq Sultan Mahmud Shah. Ed]. 

30. The likeliest aggressors would have been the kings of Jaunpur and Malwa. 

31. The name of the ruling chief of Nagaur, as stated in the TA, is Mujahid Khan. 
Qiyam Khan, whose name has been mentioned in the Wdqi‘dt-i-Mustaqi and 
Tankh-i-Da’udi, was either another member of the same family or, probably, 
there has been an error in reproducing his name. 

32. During a friendly visit to his house, Buhlul suddenly had him arrested after 
dining with him; Wdqi e dt-i-Mushtdqi, B.M. MS. pp- 6-7-

CHAPTER IX 


THE LODIS 

I. BUHLUL LODI (A.D. 1451-89) 

Buhlul belonged to the Shahu Khel clan of the Lodis who form 
an important branch of the Afghans. 1 In India the Lodis appear 
to have founded some settlements around Lamghan and Multan in c. 
A.D. 970. The colony could not, however, prosper on account of 
the subsequent rise of heresy. During the Turkish rule some of 
the Lodis served under Balban, and later, in A.D. 1341, Malik Shahu, 
the progenitor of the Lodi rulers of India, raided Multan and killed 
its governor, but failed to achieve a permanent foothold on account 
of the swift action taken by Muhammad Tughluq. Shahu’s succes¬ 
sors carried on trade with India, and one of his grandsons, Malik 
Bahram, settled in Multan early in FIruz Shah’s reign, and accepted 
service under the governor, Malik Mardan Daulat. Bahrain’s eldest 
son, Malik Sultan Shah Lodi, afterwards served under Khizr Khan, 
and distinguished himself by killing in battle the latter’s worst 
enemy, Mallu Iqbal Khan. He was rewarded with the title of 
Islam Khan and was afterwards appointed the governor of Sir- 
hind, which formed the nucleus of the future Lodi kingdom. Islam 
Khan performed heroic feats under Mubarak Shah in resisting the 
Khokhars and the Mughuls, and died during the reign of Muhammad 
Shah 2 after nominating his nephew and son-in-law, Buhlul, to suc¬ 
ceed him in his fief of Sirhind. 3 

Buhlul as a youth had been carrying on trade in horses, but 
the turning point in his career came when once he sold his finely 
bred horses to Sultan Muhammad Shah. The payment order was 
drawn on a rebellious pargana which Buhlul raided with the king’s 
permission and acquired immense spoils. Muhammad Shah was so 
pleased that he granted the pargana to Buhlul and raised him to 
the status of an amir. After Islam Khan’s death, Buhlul established 
himself at Sirhind and rapidly extended his influence and posses¬ 
sions until he held sway over the major part of the Punjab. 3 * 
Muhammad Shah., being too weak to subdue Buhlul, confirmed him 
in the territories that the latter had acquired by force of arms. That 
the Lodi chief excelled his master in strength and resources be¬ 
came apparent when Muhammad Shah invoked his help against in¬ 
vasion from Malwa. 4 Thereafter Buhlul made two abortive at¬ 
tempts to capture Delhi until at last the march of events made it 


189 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


possible for him to enter the capital of the Sultanate without fight¬ 
ing. ITe ascended the throne on April 19, 1451, and adopted the 
title of Buhlul Shah Ghazl. 4a 

The occupation of Delhi did not add considerably to Buhlul’s 
territorial possessions, but it increased his responsibilities manifold. 
He had to recreate the Sultanate and consolidate it by recovering 
neighbouring territories and bringing back to submission the rebel¬ 
lious fief-holders. He had to wage a long war with Jaunpur on 
the outcome of which depended the survival of his dynasty. Lastly, 
he had to improve and remodel the administration with due regard 
to the interests of the Afghan nobility. 

The most outstanding achievement of Buhlul’s reign was the 
conquest and annexation of Jaunpur, which not only strengthened 
the foundations of his dynasty but also won back for the Sultanate 
an important territory which had been lost as early as 1394. 5 The 
Sharqis regarded themselves as the legitimate successors of the 
Sa 3 ^yids by virtue of their matrimonial relations with the latter 6 
and the proximity of their kingdom to the boundaries of the Sulta¬ 
nate. The emergence of Lodi power, therefore, caused deep frustra¬ 
tion in Jaunpur, and the reigning monarch, Mahmud, was anxious 
to oust Buhlul before the latter had time to establish himself. He, 
therefore, attacked Delhi in the very first year of BuhluTs reign, 
and besieged the fort, which would have fallen, but for the defection 
of Mahmud’s general, Darya Khan Lodi, who was secretly won over 
by the Afghans. 7 Buhlul had left for Multan but, on hearing of 
the Sharqi attack, returned immediately and defeated Mahmud’s 
army at Narela, about 17 miles from Delhi. Mahmud returned dis¬ 
appointed and was anxious for revenge. He fought with the Lodi 
again over Etawa and Shamsabad, but the engagements remained 
inconclusive as he died suddenly in 1457. His son, Muhammad Shah 
offered to make peace, but Buhlul was not satisfied until his brother- 
in-law, Qutb Khan, who had been captured during a nocturnal action 
against Mahmud, had been released. Fighting was renewed and the 
Lodls captured Muhammad Shah’s brother, Jalal Khan. In the 
meantime a fratricidal conflict at home compelled Muhammad 
Shah to withdraw. He was defeated and killed by the forces of 
his brother, Husain, who was destined to be the last Sharqi king 
of Jaunpur. Husain enjoyed decided superiority over Buhlul in 
men and resources. He was brave but uncalculating and reckless. 
He waged ceaseless wars to destroy Buhlul, but was defeated every 
time until he was expelled from Jaunpur and forced to seek shelter 
in Bihar, which he had to abandon under Buhlul’s successor and 
retire to Bengal. Buhlul’s victory over Husain was a great mili¬ 
tary feat. In the earlier stages of the conflict Buhlul was so weak 


140 


THE LODIS 


that twice he sent emissaries to Malwa imploring aid, but un¬ 
fortunately its ruler Mahmud Khalji died before fulfilling the pro¬ 
mise of help. 7a Buhlul’s ultimate success is mainly due to his 
courageous generalship and excellent military strategy. 

The pacification of the Doab, Mewat, and the neighbouring 
area needed urgent attention as the numerous chieftains in that 
region were likely to ransfer their loyalty to the Sharqls and could 
cause embarrassment to the Sultan during his campaign against 
Jaunpur. Their allegiance, moreover, would bring in handsome 
revenues to replenish the treasury. Buhlul, therefore, led a num¬ 
ber of expeditions against Mewat, Sambhal, Koi, Saklt, Etawa, 
Kapri, Bhongaon and Gwalior. 8 The rulers and chiefs of all these 
places submitted to Buhlul at the beginning of his reign, but 
wavered in their loyalty during the succeeding years. However, 
when the sharql power was liquidated, they unreservedly acknow¬ 
ledged Buhlul’s authority. In Multan, Buhlul could not succeed 
in suppressing the chief of the Lankahs. 9 He was prevented fro pro¬ 
ceeding to Multan personally by the Sharql attack on Delhi, and an 
army sent later under his son Babak was defeated by the Lankah 
ruler, Shah Husain. 9a Likewise, Buhlul’s raid on Alhanpur, 9b a 
pargana under the jurisdiction of Ghiyas-ud-dln Khalji of Malwa, 
also failed and he had to return hurriedly when pursued by Sher 
Khan’ governor of Chanderi. 

Before his death Buhlul distributed his territories among his 
relatives and amirs. He placed his son Barbak on the throne of 
Jaunpur, gave Manikpur to Prince ‘Alam Khan, Bharaich to his 
sister’s son Kala Pahar, Lucknow and Kalpi to his grandson A‘zam 
Humayun, and Badaun to Khan Jahan Lodi. His son Nizam Khan 
(later Sultan Sikandar), whom he had nominated heir-apparent, 
held the Punjab, Delhi and most of the territory in the Doab. 
Having thus created a sort of an Afghan confederacy, BuhKil died 
about the middle of July 1489, at a place known as Malawali 9c near 
the township of Jalali in the pargana of Saklt. 

Buhlul deserves the credit of having revived the Sultanate, 
axtended its boundaries, and rehabilitated its prestige after 
years of persistent decline. His military pre-occupations did 
not allow him much time for administrative reorganization, 
although he was keen about the welfare of the people and heard 
their petitions personally to dispense justice. He was a man of lofty 
personal character and, although scrupulous in adhering to the 
tenets of Islam, was not intolerant of other creeds. 9 * 1 He won the 
devotion and esteem of his non-Muslim friends and feudatories and 
relied on them on critical occasions. He possessed a charitable dis- 


141 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


position and never turned away a suppliant from his door. He 
behaved generously even towards his bitterest foe, Husain Sharqi, 
whom he allowed to use the revenues of a part of the kingdom 
after expulsion from Jaunpur. The Sharqi queen, Bibi Khonza, 9e 
whose influence over Husain was primarily responsible for his 
recklessness, was twice taken prisoner by the Lodls, but was 
honourably restored to her husband each time. 

As a king, Buhlul was not ostentatious. He treated his fellow 
Afghans and nobles as his equals, mixed with them on social occa¬ 
sions, and even shared his carpet with them. 9f Compared with the 
attitude of previous Turkish kings of India, his behaviour towards 
the nobles might be open to criticism, but with the grim spectacle 
of a life and death struggle with the Sharqls which started at the 
very commencement of his reign, he could depend only on the sup¬ 
port of his Afghan followers some of whom had specially come 
from Roh 10 in response to his call. 10a It was no time to reform or 
discipline the uncouth Afghans, but by respecting their clannish 
feeling and their instinctive sense of freedom, he managed to win 
and retain their allegiance, and ultimately succeeded in laying the 
foundations of the dynasty on a firm basis. 

II. SIKANDAR SHAH (A.D. 1489-1517). 

Buhlul had nominated his son Nizam Khan as his successor but 
on the eve of his death, a group of nobles tried to prevail on him 
to change the will in favour of his other son, Barbak, or his grand¬ 
son, A‘zam Humayun. They did not succeed, but two days after 
the death of Buhlul there was a heated discussion among them in 
which Nizam Khan’s mother bodly intervened on behalf of her 
son. The successful faction carried Buhlul’s coffin to Jalali where 
Nizam Khan arrived on July 15, 1489, and the very next day was 
crowned king with the title of Sikandar Shah. He was the ablest 
among the surviving sons of Buhlul and proved worthy of the 
choice as king by carrying out successfully the task begun by his 
father. 

Sikandar lost no time in suppressing the opponents who might 
still dispute his succession. He won over to his side his brother 
‘Alam Khan, and overcame by force his nephew, A‘zam Humayun, 
and his uncle, ‘Isa Khan. As for Barbak, Sikandar did not want to 
remove him from Jaunpur provided he agreed to remain peaceful 
and loyal. Barbak, however, refused to acknowledge his brother’s 
author^. Thereupon Sikandar defeated him in a battle near 
Kanauj but, with fraternal affection, reinstated him at Jaunpur, 
taking care, at the same time, to nominate his own men to all 


142 


THE LODIS 


important offices at the court and outside. Shortly afterwards 
there was a rising as Jaunpur organized by powerful zamindars and 
men of the Bachgoti tribe, 10b headed by their leader Juga. 10c Barbak 
fled in panic and Sikandar rushed from his playground to coerce the 
rebels before they had mustered strength. The zamindars were 
defeated and Juga was forced to take refuge with the exiled Husain 
Sharql at the fort of Jaund. 1Qd Barbak was restored once more, but 
he again proved incapable of dealing with another rebellion of the 
zamindars. Sikandar at last ordered him to be arrested and took 
over the administration of Jaunpur. 

Husain Sharqi, who was biding his time in exile, entertained 
secret hopes of recovering his kingdom after Buhlul’s death. He 
tried to exploit the differences between Barbak and Sikandar, but 
the latter’s firmness and success disappointed him. He appeared to be 
in league with the rebel zamindars at Jaunpur and harboured the 
Bachgoti leader Juga. Sikandar, who pursued Juga up to the fort 
of Jaund, politely asked Husain to surrender the rebel and retain 
the fort as well as the lands which the latter was in possession of. 
Husain returned a haughty answer and prepared to give battle. 
He was severely defeated and put to flight, but a few years later, 
in 1494, he marched out again on learning that a large number of 
the Sultan’s horses had died. He was again defeated by Sikandar 
near Banaras and hotly pursued until he crossed into Bengal where 
he spent the rest of his life at Colgong as a pensioner of Sultan 
‘Ala-ud-din Husain Shah. Sikandar’s authority was thenceforth fully 
established in Bihar. The Rai of Tirhut also submitted peacefully. 

Husain’s flight to Bengal led to an expedition against that coun¬ 
try in 1495. As neither side was serious about fighting; Sultan 
Husain Shah behaved wisely in sending his son, Daniyal, to nego¬ 
tiate. He settled with Sikandar’s agents the terms of a peace treaty 
according to which both the monarchs agreed to respect each other’s 
frontiers. The king of Bengal further promised not to harbour 
Sikandar’s enemies. It was wise on Sikandar’s part to have realized 
the limitation of his own resources and striven to maintain peaceful 
relations with other independent Muslim kingdoms. His policy to¬ 
wards Malwa was guided by the same considerations and, although 
internal strife in that State provided him with a favourable chance 
of interfering with its affairs, he appears to have restrained his ambi¬ 
tion and held himself aside as far as he possibly could. In 1510, 
Shihab-ud-dm, son of Sultan Nasir-ud-dm of Malwa, having rebelled 
against his father, sought Sikandar’s protection. Naslr-ud-din, 
however, advanced quickly to Chanderi and punished Shihab-ud-dln 
by nominating as heir-apparent his younger son, Mahmud II, whose 


143 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


claim was thenceforth severely contested by another son Sahib 
Khan. In March 1513, Sahib Khan came to Chanderi and appealed 
to Sikandar for help. A detachment was sent from Delhi, 
but it remained stationed at a short distance from Chanderi, and 
returned without taking part in any engagement. Soon after, how¬ 
ever, Sahib Khan became suspicious of his own partisans, 11 and 
arrived as a fugitive at Sikandar’s court. The Sultan promptly sent 
him back with a large force to Chanderi where he was kept in- 
virtual internment while the administration was carried on by 
Sikandar’s amirs. 

Sikandar was keen on reducing the Rajput States but his efforts 
in that direction met with only partial success. The Raja of Gwalior, 
who had submitted to Ruhlul just before the latter’s death, conti¬ 
nued his allegiance to Sikandar for some time. However, the asylum 
which he provided for the Raja of Dholpur, coupled with his envoy’s 
discourtesy, annoyed the Sultan who attacked the State in 1502. 
The Raja submitted immediately, but three years later, he attacked 
Sikandar’s army returning to Dholpur. He was defeated again, but 
Sikandar continued the march to Agra on account of the approaching 
rains, without completing the conquest of Gwalior which remained 
unsubdued for the rest of his reign. The conquest of Dholpur did 
not present much difficulty and Raja Binayak, although reinstated 
after his defeat in 1502, was again removed in 1505 to prevent him 
from allying himself with Gwalior against Delhi. Mandrail was 
conquered the same year and, two years later, Utgir also fell. There¬ 
after Sikandar laid siege to Narwar and, after conquering it, 
strengthened its defences by building an auxiliary fort. 

' i 

Rai Bhaidchandra, the Vaghela Raja of Rewa, who was an ally 
of Husain Sharqi, submitted to Sikandar in 1942 when the latter 
entered Kantit. 12 He was, however, frightened by the Sultan’s 
movement towards Arail, 13 and suddenly went away from the royal 
camp leaving his baggage which was returned to him intact. The 
Raja having failed to renew his pledge of loyalty, Sikandar marched 
against him in 1495 but he fled towards Sarkaj 13a and died on the 
way. The Sultan returned to Jaunpur but a large number of his 
horses died on account of the strain of the long journey. Hearing 
of this, Bhaid’s younger son, Lakshmlchandra, incited Husain Sharqi 
to fight again. Sikandar was, however, able to conciliate Bhaid’s 
eldest son and successor Salivahana, who helped him in defeating 
ttie exiled Sharqi king. Their relations improved to such an extent 
that the Sultan ventured to ask the hand of his daughter in marriage. 
On his refusal Sikandar raided his country in 1498, but when he 


144 


THE LODIS 


advanced as far as Bandugarh, he found the fort to be too strong 
and returned to Jaunpur. 

In Nagaur, Sikandar’s supremacy was acknowledged by its 
ruler Muhammad Khan who wished to prevent his two 
brothers, ‘All Khan and Abu Bakr, from receiving help against 
him. Sikandar gladly patronized Muhammad Khan and compen¬ 
sated ‘All Khan with the grant of the small fief of Sui near Rantham- 
bhor. After some time ‘All Khan was replaced by his brother Abu 
Bakr when it was discovered that the former had been guilty of 
duplicity in secretly dissuading Daulat Khan, governor of Rantham- 
bhor, from transferring his allegiance from Malwa to Delhi. 

The old and almost ruined capital of Delhi had lost its charm 
for Sikandar, and political and strategic considerations induced him 
to choose another place. In 1499 he moved his residence to Sambhal 
where he spent about four years. His partial success in the cam¬ 
paigns against the Rajput States raised in his eyes the importance 
of Agra where, in 1504, he founded a new town and transferred his 
capital to it. This provided him with a base from which he could 
exercise better control over turbulent areas. Agra was formerly a 
dependency of Bayana which was held by the Auhadis. At the out¬ 
set of Sikandar’s reign, the then Amir of Bayana, Sultan Sharaf, 
agreed, at the king’s suggestion, to exchange his possessions with 
Jalesar, Chandwar, Marehra and Sakit. At the last moment, how¬ 
ever, he went back on his word and consequently both he and his 
vassal, Haibat Khan Jilwani, who held Agra, had to be forcibly ex¬ 
pelled in 1491. 

Sikandar improved upon his father’s system of government by 
slowly centralizing the administration and persuading the Afghan 
chiefs to learn obedience to authority. He re-united the kingdom 
by annexing Jaunpur and extended his control gradually over pro¬ 
vincial affairs. The nobles were required to behave respectfully 
in the Sultan’s presence, 14 and to show due regard to his orders in 
distant places. 16 They were also told to submit their accounts to 
the Ministry of Finance, and serious notice was taken of defaults 
and embezzlements. 16 The Sultan, however, took care not to rouse 
open hostility. He treated the elderly Afghan chiefs with consi¬ 
deration and appreciated the sentiments and prejudices of his 
Afghan followers. He had also arranged to keep himself informed 
of the affairs of the nobles and the people by a cleverly organized 
intelligence system. Every morning he received reports of the 
important occurrences of the previous day as well as of the prices 
of various commodities, and took prompt action if anything went 
wrong. He did not show any partiality to rank or status in the 


145 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


administration of justice, which was even-handed for both the high 
and the low. For this purpose the Sultan’s special representative 
remained at the seat of justice the whole day long, while the q azls 
and the ‘ulama’ were present inside the palace. Special messengers 
conveyed reports of all judicial discussions to the king who frequent¬ 
ly intervened personally to avert the miscarriage of justice. 16a 

Sikandar’s regard for the well-being of his subjects, his bene¬ 
volence, and love for justice ushered in an era of peace and pros¬ 
perity in which trade and agriculture flourished. Grains and other 
goods were available in such abundance that men of moderate 
means could also live in comfort. The cultivation of the arts of 
peace by happy and contented minds brought about a cultural re¬ 
naissance which transcended communal barriers. The literary out- 
burst of the period was unrivalled for centuries past and included 
translations of Sanskrit works into Persian, 17 the collection of old 
manuscripts on different subjects, and the composition of new lite¬ 
rary works. The Sultan was a poet himself, 18 and his bounteous 
appreciation of learning attracted scholars from distant lands to his 
court where they received every encouragement. He was also keen¬ 
ly interested in music and the enthusiasm which he showed in its 
promotion is testified to by the rare contemporary work Lahjat-i - 
Sikandar Shahi . 18a A happy result of the cultural activity of the 
period was the mutual interest it aroused among Hindus and Muslims 
for each other’s learning, thus conducing to a rapprochement which 
was in consonance with the progressive spirit of the time. 

Endowed with virtues of piety and decency, the Sultan held 
aloof from frivolous pursuits, engaging himself generally with the 
affairs of the State on which he worked strenuously till midnight, 
He disliked the company of unworthy people, so much so that, even 
in the matter of State appointments, his chief criteria were charac¬ 
ter and heredity. Some writers have referred to his drinking in 
secret, but according to the contemporary chronicler, Mushtaqi, no 
one ever saw him either taking wine or in a state of drunkenness. 
He was exceedingly generous and had made elaborate arrangements 
throughout the kingdom for the distribution of charities, comprising 
food, clothing and other necessities of life, to the poor and the needy, 
Half-yearly lists were submitted to him of deserving persons who 
were awarded regular stipends. The nobles also emulated the king 
as far as possible. 

Unfortunately, Sikandar, deeply devoted to Islam, was in¬ 
tolerant of other faiths. Born of a Hindu mother, 19 and anxious to 
marry a Hindu princess, his attitude towards this religion of a vast 
majority of his subjects appears to be rather baffling and inexpli- 


146 


THE LODIS 


cable, for, it was bound to prejudice the realization of his political 
aims. 19a Even as a prince he had been dissuaded from raiding the 
Hindu tanks at Thaneswar by a verdict of the famous divine, Mian 
‘Abdullah of Ajudhan, who had also ruled against the demolition of 
non-Muslim places of worship. Sikandar, as a king, however, fre¬ 
quently razed temples to the ground and erected mosques and public 
utility buildings in their place, as illustrated by his behaviour at 
Mandrail, Utgir and Narwar. At Mathura he prevented the Hindus 
from bathing at their sacred ghats or having themselves shaved, 
The stones of broken images of Hindu idols brought from Nagarkot 
were given away to butchers to be used as weights. 1913 On the top of 
all, a Brahmana named Bodhan, 20 who had endorsed the truth of 
Islam as well as of his own faith, was put to death after the question 
had been discussed at length by the ‘ulamd’. Such an irrational 
policy is indefensible in modern times, even though it be granted, 
that in the age in which Sikandar lived, tolerance was not the order 
of the day. It may, however, be stated that Sikandar, in conformity 
with his opposition to idolatry, stopped some of the semi-idolatrous 
practices that had grown up among the Muslims also, such as the 
annual procession of Salar Mas‘ud Ghazl’s lance, 21 the visits to the 
tombs of saints by Muslim women, and the carrying of ta‘ziyas 22 
during Muharram. That he was ready at one stage to destroy 
even the beautiful mosques built by the Sharqi kings in order to 
obliterate the memory of his foes, but was held back by the f ulamd 
shows that the occasional fury of his temper did contribute to his 
intolerance which was apparently not confined to a particular sec¬ 
tion of the people. It may also be noted that in the matter of 
general administration and in his economic and judicial improve¬ 
ments, he made no kind of discrimination among his subjects. 

Sikandar was personally brave and dauntless and it is said 
that Buhlul’s choice of him as a successor was prompted by the 
heroic manner in which, as a prince, he had suppressed Tatar Khan’s 
revolt in the Punjab. 22a As a king, he led most of the campaigns in 
person, but whenever he stayed behind, he regularly sent orders 
twice a day to be delivered to the commanders at each halt even if 
the distance involved was 500 to 1,000 miles. This was achieved 
by means of a system of carrier-horses that existed for sending 
messages to provincial governors. The Sultan possessed a fine 
physique and handsome appearance, and it was perhaps on account 
of his care for the latter that he did not wish to grow a beard, in 
spite of the remonstrances of HajI Abdul Wahhab. 22b He died on 
November 21, 1517 on account of a disease of the throat. 220

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


III. IBRAHIM LODI (A.D. 1517-26) 

After Sikandar’s death, his son Ibrahim was elevated to the 
throne without opposition. The experiment of a dual monarchy 
was revived when, at the very commencement of the reign, 
Ibrahim agreed to have his brother Jalal Khan installed as 
independent ruler of Jaunpur. 22d However, before the latter had 
established himself there, Ibrahim, on the advice of some wiser 
amirs, repented of his folly and deputed an agent to persuade Jalal 
to come to Delhi. 22e On Jalal’s refusal to yield, the King sent secret 
instructions to the chief nobles and governors not to recognize his 
brother’s authority, thereby compelling Jalal to leave Jaunpur and 
return to his old fief of Kalpl. Jalal succeeded, however, in win¬ 
ning over to his side an important amir, A‘zam Humayun Sarwani, 
with whose help he quickly recovered Awadh. Their friendship 
did not last long, for, when Ibrahim marched to oppose them, A‘zam 
Humayun again came over to the Sultan and Jalal was forced to 
retreat. Leaving behind his family at Kalpl, the prince, in despe¬ 
ration, proceeded towards Agra where Ibrahim’s general, Malik 
Adam, persuaded him to accept the permanent assignment of Kalpl 
by surrendering his claims to sovereign power. The negotiations 
were helpful in putting off the prince for some time, as Ibrahim 
later on disapproved of this arrangement and decided to get rid 
of his brother. Jalal ran away to Gwalior, and thence to Malwa, 
but being unwelcome there fled to the country of the Gonds 
who betrayed him to the King. Ibrahim sent him to HansI where 
his other brothers were imprisoned, but he was killed on his way 
to that place. 22f 

The temporary asylum which Jalal had secured at Gwalior 
provided Ibrahim with the pretext for completing his father’s pro¬ 
ject of conquering this important Rajput State. 

He sent a strong force comprising 30,000 horsemen and 300 
elephants under A‘zam Humayun Sarwani, governor of Kara, to 
besiege the fortress. In the meantime Raja Man, who had defied 
Sikandar’s authority, died. His son Vikramjit, unable to with¬ 
stand the pressure of the Sultan’s army which had been reinforced 
by a fresh force under nine amirs, surrendered at last. 23 This out¬ 
standing military achievement was somewhat neutralized by the 
defeat of Ibrahim’s forces which were sent against Rana Sanga of 
Mewar. 23a 

Jalal Khan’s rebellion left a deep impression on Ibrahim’s 
mind. It made him suspicious of his nobles and strengthened his 
resolve to centralize all power by the outright suppression of 
Afghan nobility. Unlike his father who had slowly asserted 


148 


THE LODIS 


royal authority without outraging the sentiments of his Afghan 
followers, Ibrahim required the nobles to observe proper court 
ceremonial and purge their minds of any thoughts of equality based 
on clannish affinity with the king. Even though the past history 
of Muslim rule in India supported such a view of kingship, 
Ibrahim failed to understand the difference between Turkish 
ascendency and Afghan hegemony. The transformation might have 
been slowly effected, but could not be abruptly imposed. Without 
realizing, therefore, that his success as a ruler depended on the 
military support of his nobles, he decided to destroy the very men 
whose help he needed most. A‘zam Humayun Sarwani who, by his 
timely reunion, had contributed to the Sultan’s victory over Jalal, was 
recalled from the siege of Gwalior and put in chains. Likewise, 
Mian Bhuwah, who had distinguished himself as the wazlr since 
Sikandar’s days, was also imprisoned. 

The manifestation of capricious tyranny led to the revolt at 
Kara by A‘zam Humayun Sarwani’s son, Islam Khan, who was sup¬ 
ported by two important Lodi chiefs, Sa £ id Khan and A‘zam 
Humayun 24 who had suddenly returned from Gwalior. When an 
army sent against the insurgents suffered a reverse, Ibrahim up¬ 
braided the commanding nobles and called upon them to crush the 
revolt on pain of being considered otherwise as traitors. The 
rebels, who had mustered 40,000 men, demanded A‘zam Humayun 
Sarwani’s release, but Ibrahim refused it in spite of a Muslim 
saint’s 243 intercession. The Sultan would not compromise on any 
terms and ordered Darya Khan Lohani, governor of Bihar, Nasir Khan 
Lohani of Ghazipur, and Shaikh Muhammad Farmuli to join the 
royal army with all their strength. After a sanguinary battle in 
which 10,000 Afghans fell, the rebels were defeated and Islam Khan 
Sarwani was killed. 

Rather than learn any useful lesson from the revolt, Ibrahim 
regarded the victory as a success of his policy and became even 
more ruthless. Mian Bhuwah was put to death and A f zam 
Humayun Sarwani, who also died in captivity, is believed by some 
writers to have been killed by the King’s orders. 2413 Another 
grandee, Mian Husain Farmuli, was set upon by the Sultan’s hire¬ 
lings and done to death at Chanderi. 24c This sent a wave of indigna¬ 
tion and alarm among the other nobles who began to contemplate 
drastic measures for their own safety. In the eastern part of the 
kingdom important Lodi and Farmuli amirs began to organize 
themselves, while Darya Khan Lohani, whom Ibrahim had next 
decided to degrade, resolved to cast off his allegiance. After his 
sudden death, his son Bahar Khan, assuming leadership of the dis¬ 
affected nobles, declared independence and styled himself Sultan 


149 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Muhammad. He occupied the country from Bihar to Sambhal and, 
for a little over two years, had the khutba read in his name. He 
was joined by Nasir Khan LohanI, governor of Ghazipur, Fath 
Khan, another son of A‘zam Humayun SarwanI, and Sher Khan Sur 
(later Sultan Sher Shah). 

While Ibrahim’s armies fought a series of engagements with 
the rebellious amirs in the eastern provinces, Daulat Khan Lodi, 
governor of the Punjab, opened negotiations with Babur. 
Daulat Khan had evaded Ibrahim’s summons and his son, whom he 
sent to call upon the King, soon after ran back to Lahore to escape 
arrest. The shocking account of Ibrahim’s cruelty, which Daulat 
Khan heard from his son, 25 convinced him that it was impossible 
for him to continue his allegiance to the Sultan. As he was not 
able to organize the kind of revolt that the Afghan nobles in Bihar 
had done, he preferred to turn to Babur for help, and sent his son 25a 
to Kabul for this purpose. Almost simultaneously, Ibrahim’s uncle 
‘Alam Khan, who had been biding his time in Gujarat and was 
sought out by the dissatisfied amirs to replace Ibrahlm 25b also arrived 
at Kabul to seek Babur’s support. Babur, who was anxious to 
annex the Punjab to his kingdom, welcomed this opportunity of 
extending his possessions, and led an expedition in 1524 to Lahore, 20 
where he defeated Ibrahim’s army under Bahar Khan Lodi. Daulat 
Khan had already fled towards Multan from where he came to meet 
Babur at Dlpalpur. 

Babur, however, instead of reinstating Daulat Khan, appointed 
his own officials at Lahore and assigned to the latter some minor dis¬ 
tricts. 27 This infuriated Daulat Khan who turned hostile after 
Babur’s return to Kabul, whereupon the latter entered into an 
arrangement with ‘Alam Khan to help him in capturing Delhi on 
condition that he (Babur) was to retain the Punjab in full sove¬ 
reignty. ‘Alam Khan was later gained over by Daulat Khan and, 
with a combined Afghan force of thirty to forty thousand strong, he 
attacked Delhi in 1525 , but was easily defeated by Ibrahim. 27a In the 
meantime Babur, realizing that neither Daulat Khan nor ‘Alam 
Khan could be relied upon, set out on his own account for a final 
and decisive invasion of India. After spending a few months in 
conquering the Punjab and disposing of his Afghan opponents, he 
advanced towards Delhi. Ibrahim marched forward and the two 
armies clashed with each other at Panipat on April 20 , 1526 . In 
spite of overwhelming superiority in numbers 28 Ibrahim was de¬ 
feated and slain. Babur’s historic victory was chiefly due to his 
superior fighting technique, skilful employment of trained cavalry, 
and an enviable store of artillery.

Endowed with courage and bravery, Ibrahim possessed the 
qualities of a soldier, but was unfortunately rash and impolitic in 
his actions. His attempt at absolutism, though necessary, was pre¬ 
mature and his policy of mere repression, unaccompanied by mea¬ 
sures to strengthen the administration and augment his military re¬ 
sources, was bound to fail. That he should have chosen to alienate 
his powerful nobles at a time when the danger of an external in¬ 
vasion loomed large in the north-west, betrayed a lack of foresight 
which proved disastrous both to himself and to his dynasty. In 
private life, Ibrahim’s conduct was unblemished. He was kindly 
disposed towards his subjects and friendly with the saints and 
divines. 28a He took keen interest in the promotion of agriculture 
and both he and his nobles received their share of the produce 
in kind. There was always an abundance of crops and the people 
in general lived happily in the midst of cheapness and plenty. 

1. The origin of the Afghans is obscure and the traditional theory tracing their 
descent from the Jewish king Talut (Saul) lacks historical support. It is, 
however, generally held that the Khaljls who belonged to the Turkish stock 
and a number of whom had migrated to the Afghan lands of Ghaznin, Balkh, 
Tukharistan, Bust and Guzganin were gradually transformed into Ghilzals. 
They are believed to have been the progenitors of important Afghan clans 
including that of the Lodis. See Hudud-ul-Alarm Tr. pp. Ill, 348, Ma’asir-i- 
Mahmud Shahi Bodleian MS. fol. 12, Tarikh-i-Haqqi Cambridge MS. p. 106. 

2. According to the T'A., he was killed in 1431 while fighting against Shaikh ‘All 
the Mughul. This is incorrect, for he was alive during a part of Muhammad 
Shah’s reign and introduced his nephew to the Sultan. Nizam-ud-dln has, 
probably, confused him with one Sulaiman Lodi who was killed in 1431. See 
Tdrikh-i-Sadr-i-Jahan Paris MS. fol. 172a, T.M. 219, Tdrikh-iMushtdqi 
B.M.MS. fol. 5a, Tarikh-i-Da’udi, S.O.A.S. MS. p. 5. 

3. He preferred Buhlul to his own son, Qutb Khan, firstly because Buhlul appear¬ 
ed to be more capable and, secondly, as the Ajsana-i-Shdhdn has pointed out, 
Qutb Khan was born of a Rajput mother,while his daughter, Firdausi, whom 
Islam Khan had given in marriage to Buhlul, was from an Afghan lady. 
Buhlul was a full-blooded Afghan as his father, Kala Lodi, had married an 
uncle’s daughter. The story goes that Kala having died in an encounter with 
the Niazi Afghans, Buhlul was born posthumously in extraordinary circum¬ 
stances- His mother, while close on confinement, died suddenly on account 
of the falling of the house, and he was taken out by the ‘Caesarean operation’ 
Thus orphaned completely, he was taken as a month-old baby to his uncle 
who brought him up as a son. The chances were, therefore, all for Buhlul, 
and the clannish sentiment being very strong among the Afghans, Qutb Khan 
might not have been acceptable to the majority of them. 

3a. The entire area covering DIpalpur, Lahore, Panipat and Sirhind was under 
the control of Buhlul. The statement of the TA with regard to the disunity 
among the Afghans and the campaigns undertaken by Muhammad Shah’s 
minister, Sikandar Tuhfa, against Buhlul is not confirmed by the earlier autho¬ 
rities such as the Tarikh-i-mushtcLq t and the Majami‘-ul-Akhbcir.

always urged her husband to recover her parental heritage. 

7. The Afghan envoy, Shams-ud-din, who came to deliver the keys of the fort 
of Darya Khan Lodi, reminded the latter of his affiliations with the Afghans 
and appealed to him to save the honour of the Afghan ladies besieged in the 
fort. See Waqi e at-i-Mushtdqi B.M MS. p. 8.

A minor raid which, according to Mushtaqi, the Afghan soldiers carried 
out early in Buhlul’s reign on a turbulent village near Nimkhar, a dependency 
of Kanauj, has been described in the Tarikh-i-Shahi as a major expedition of 
Buhlul who is reported to have acquired thereby immense booty and plunder. 
Elliot has given the name of the place as Munkhar which is not, however, sup¬ 
ported by the printed text of the Tarikh-i-Shahi nor by the account of the 
Tdrikh-i-Da’udi which is almost similar to that of Mushtaqi. See Wdqi ( at-i- 
Mushtdqi B.M. MS. p. 186; Tdrikh-i-Da’udi S.O.A.S. MS. p. 21; Tdrikh-i- 
Shdhi, p. 20; HIED V, p. 5 n. 1. 

Abu-’l Fazl has described Nimkhar as a Mahal in the Sarkar of Khairabad 
(Oudh) with a brick fort and a shrine of great resort. (Ain, Text I, pp. 434, 
438.) 

9. His original name was Budhan Khan Sindhi who hailed from Uchh and occu¬ 
pied Multan after expelling the Sayyid governor, Khan-i-Khanan. (See 
Tdrikh-i-Haqqi, Cambridge MS. pp. 128-29). The statement of some of the 
authorities including ‘Abbas Sarwani, Mir Ma‘sum and Nizam-ud-din that a 
Lankah chief named R'ai Sahra drove out Shaikh Yusuf Quraishl whom the 
people of Multan had raised to power, is to be discounted. 

9a. He became the ruler of Multan in 1469-70 after the death of his father, Qutb- 
ud-din, who had succeeded Mahmud Shah in 1454. 

The reference in the Tdrikh-i-Shdhi to Ahmad Khan Bhatti’s rebellion 
in Sind and the appeal for help made by the ruler of Multan to Buhlul, is not 
confirmed by any earlier authority. The Lankah rulers were never reconciled 
to Buhlul and they could not possibly have asked his help to suppress a rebel 
of Sind when they were strong enough to defeat the army of Delhi and also 
to repulse an attack from Malwa. 

9b. It was situated in close proximity to the fort of Ranthambhor, the capture of 
which was, in fact, Buhlul’s real object. The author of the Tdrikh-i-Shdhi 
has substituted for the Alhanpur raid an account of Buhlul’s expedition 
against the Rajput State of Mewar which is not, however, mentioned by any 
other authority. He has, probably confused Malwa with Mewar, and Alhanpur 
with Udaipur which was founded much later. His reference to Ajmer as the 
place where Buhlul pitched his camp, is also wrong as Ajmer at that time lay 
within the jurisdiction of Malwa. 

Similarly Ahmad Yadgar’s reference to Ujjain as a Hindu territory, where 
Buhlul, during another expedition, subjugated a large number of Hindus, is 
wrong, because Ujjain also formed a part of the kingdom of Malwa. (See 
Tdrikh-i-Haqqi Cambridge MS. p. 109, Tarikh-i-Ndsir Shdhi I.O. MS. fol. 
24b.) 

9c. Now called Milauli, situated at a distance of about 15 miles to the north of 
Sakit in the Etah district. (See Neave: Etah, map of the district.) 

None of the authorities has given the exact date of BuhluTs death which 
probably occurred about a week earlier than Sikandar’s accession (July 16, 
1489). See Tdrikh-i-Alfi B.M. MS. fol. 496b., Khulasat-ut-Twarikh, Cambridge 
MS. fol. 153a. 

9d. For his association with holy men and his punctuality in saying prayers, see 
Siyar-ul-Arifin I.O. MS. fols. 235-6; Gulzar-i-Abrar, Lindesiana MS. fol. 132a, 
A.S.B. Calcutta MS. fol. 67b. Ma’asir-i-Rahimi, I, 438. 

According to Majdmi ( -ul-Akhbdr, (I.O. MS. fol. 349a), the people of India 
regarded Buhlulas a saint and attributed to him even miraculous deeds. This, 
however, appears to be an exaggeration. 

9e. She was the daughter of ‘Alam Shah, the Sayyid (vide note 6, above. See 
Tdrikh-i-Mushtaqi, B.M. MS. fol. 7a. 

The Mirdt-i-J ahdn Numd (I.O. MS. fol. 295b) gives her name as Bibl 
Khuban. In CHI III (231, 255) it is, however, mentioned as Jallla which has 
probably been obtained by changing the Arabic adject ; .ve, Halila, (meaning, “a 
lawful wife”) into proper noun by the addition of a dot.

The TA, Tdrikh-i-Khan-Jahdni and some other authorities have omitted 
Juga’s name and have mentioned only the Bachgotis. This has led Hodivala, 
who has not consulted Mushtaqi, to accuse 'Abdullah of misreading Bajkoti in 
the TA and changing it into Jaggu or Jugga. Hodivala is wrong in remarking 
that Jugga’s name has not been mentioned by any earlier authority, nor is it 
possible to agree with him that ‘Abdullah has borrowed the account of this 
episode from the TA. The writer has, on the other hand, found that ‘Abdullah 
has drawn upon Mushtaqi more frequently than on any other source. 

lOd. Abu-’l Fazl has located it in the Rohtas Sarkar of the province of Bihar (Ain. 
I, 423). In the Wdqi’dt-i-Mushtaqi (MS. p. 21) it is written as Chaund which 
helps in identifying it further as modern Chainpur in the Shahabad district. 
After the fall of Jaund (see below), Juga presumably fled to an unknown 
destination, for, no more was heard of him. 

11. He lost confidence in Bahjat Khan, the governor of ChanderT, who had originally 
invited him. See Hasan Khaki: Muntakhab-ut-Twarikh, Eton College MS. fol.

and also partly to the bhakti movement. 

19b. It is related by the authorities that the stones of idols brought from Nagar- 
kot were given away to butchers to be used as weights. Hodivala, however, 
considers it to be “a wandering tale of iconoclastic zeal, which appears in vary¬ 
ing forms under Mahmud of Ghazna, FIruz Tughluq and Ghias-ud-dln Khaljl of 
Malwa.” ( Studies in Indo-Muslim History, p. 468-9.) 

20. The name is also written as Yodhan and Lodhan, due no doubt to the fact that 
in Persian MSS. it is merely a question of dropping or adding a dot. 

21. Salar Mas‘ud GhazI, believed to be a sister’s son of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, 
is represented in popular legends as a saint and martyr and a number or mira¬ 
culous exploits are attributed to him. Mir’at-i-Mas’udi B.M. MS. fols. 17, 86,

22a. Tatar Khap Yusuf Khail was governor of the Punjab who revolted during the

of the eastern part of his kingdom, he wrote to his son, Nizam Khan, at Panipat 
to display princely courage by subduing that rebel. (Set Tarlkh-i-Mushtaql, 
BM. MS. fols. 9-il).

and had settled in Delhi where he died in 1526-27. (See Am, Text, II, 222

22c. The disease was superstitiously believed to have been inflicted on him in con¬ 
sequence of some disrespectful remarks which he made in relation to HajI 
‘Abdul Wahhab. (See Wdqi‘dt-i-Mushtdqi B.M. MS. p. 53 and Tartkh-i- 
Dd’udi S.O.A.S. MS. pp. 65-6. 

22d. The arrangement was carried out at the behest of some self-seeking nobles. 
It is not possible to accept the view of some authorities that Sikandar himself 
divided the kingdom between his two sons, for, no one knew better than he, 
the dangerous consequences of it. See Maydmi‘-al-Akhbdr I.O. MS. fol. 344b.

23a. According to the contemporary writer, MushtaqI, the Lodi army suffered a 
defeat because one of the powerful Afghan nobels, Mian Husain Farmull, who 
accompanied it and whom Ibrahim had ordered to be arrested, went over to 
Rana Sanga. Later, however, when Husain Farmull rejoined the Sultan’s 
army, Rana Sanga hastily withdrew towards his own capital. See Wdqi e gt-i-

n. 1) has identified as Sayyid Sadr-ud-dln Raja Qattal Bukhari, brother of 
Sayyid Jalal-ud-dln Makhdum-i-Jahanian. This cannot, however, be correct 
as Shaikh Sadr-ud-dln died in 827 A.H/A.D. 1423, about a century earlier than 
Ibrahim’s accession. Most probably the name of the saint who tried to avert 
a suicidal clash among the Afghans was Shaikh Yusuf Qattal who died at Delhi 
in 933 A.H/A.D. 1527, and whom Nizam-ud-dln and other writers have con¬ 
fused with Shaikh Raju Bukhari on account of the common suffix Qattal (See 
Akhbar-ul-Akhyar , p. 219).

CHAPTER X 


THE SUCCESSION STATES OF THE 
DELHI SULTANATE 

A. GUJARAT 

2 . MUZAFFAR SHAH I (A.D . 1392-1410) 

During the reign of FIruz Shah, as mentioned above, Malik 
Mufarrah, also known as Farhat-ul-Mulk and Rasti Khan, was ap¬ 
pointed governor of Gujarat in A.D. 1377, and held that post for ten 
years. In 1387, Sikandar Khan was sent to replace Farhat-ul-Mulk 
which provoked the latter to take up arms. Rasti Khan defeated 
and killed Sikandar Khan, but the central administration had be¬ 
come so lax that no action was taken against him and he was allow¬ 
ed to continue as governor. 1 

According to Firishta, Farhat-ul-Mulk aimed at establishing an 
independent dynasty at Gujarat and, “in order to gain popularity 
for the furtherance of that object, he encouraged the Hindu religion 
and thus promoted rather than suppressed, the worship of idols”. In 
1391, therefore, the orthodox Muslims of Gujarat sent a petition to 
the Sultan at Delhi for the removal of the tolerant governor. In 
response to this appeal Sultan Nasir-ud-din Muhammad appointed 
Zafar Khan, the son of Wajih-ul-Mulk, as governor of Gujarat and 
conferred on him the title of Muzaffar Khan and presented him with 
a red canopy which was then exclusively used by the kings. 

Farhat adopted a hostile attitude and Muzaffar tried in vain 
to induce him to come to terms. A battle was fought at Kamboi, 
situated about 20 miles west of Anahilwara Patan, in which Muzaffar 
inflicted a crushing defeat on Farhat who was killed (A.D. 1392). 
Muzaffar then occupied Anahilwara, and Sultan Muhammad sent him 
a congratulatory letter addressing him as A'zam Hurnayun. 

In 1394, after the death of Sultan Muhammad, many Hindu 
chiefs in Gujarat broke out into rebellion, of which the most seri¬ 
ous was led by the Raja of Idar. Muzaffar, after a protracted 
siege of Idar, during which he ravaged the surrounding territory, 
forced the Raja to submit. He then advanced towards Somanatha, 
but had to return on receipt of the news that, Nasir, the king of 
Khandesh, had been raiding Nandurbar. Nasir fled at the approach 
of Muzaffar. 


155 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Next year (1395) Muzaffar invaded Somanatha, burnt the temple 
and broke the idol. He killed many Hindus and left the place 
after arranging for the erection of a mosque. In 1401, however, 
news reached him that the Hindus were trying to restore the temple 
of Somanatha and revive their customary worship. Muzaffar imme¬ 
diately proceeded thither with an army, and the Hindus, defeated 
after a sharp encounter, retired to the fort of Dip. This fort also 
fell after a few days, and Muzaffar killed the garrison and had the 
chief men of the place trampled under the feet of elephants. He 
also demolished the temples and laid the foundation of a mosque. 

While Muzaffar was appointed governor of Gujarat in 1391, 
his son Tatar Khan, was retained by Sultan Muhammad in Delhi as 
his wdzlr . Tatar Khan, as noted above, took a prominent part in 
the intrigues and civil war that followed after the death of Sultan 
Muhammad (1394) for succession to the throne, but, being out¬ 
manoeuvred by Mallu Iqbal, retired to Gujarat, with a view to 
collect troops and make another attempt on Delhi. But Timur’s 
invasion intervened, and Tatar’s ambitious project had to be given 
up for the time being. 

During Timur’s invasion, the fugitive Sultan Mahmud sought 
shelter in Gujarat where Muzaffar received him warmly but “did 
not accord the treatment and respect that was due to him”, so that 
the Sultan “becoming hopeless and heart-broken” left for Malwa, 
as mentioned above. 

In A.D. 1403, Tatar urged his father to march on Delhi which, 
he promised, would be easy to capture. But Muzaffar declined to 
risk the reality of power which he was enjoying in Gujarat for the 
doubtful success his son hoped for at Delhi. According to most 
of the available accounts, Tatar thereupon imprisoned his father 
and proclaimed himself king under the title Muhammad Shah in 
A.D. 1403. According to Nizam-ud-dm, however, Muzaffar volun¬ 
tarily relinquished his power to his son, when he found the latter 
bent on the invasion of Delhi. Firishta, who records both the ver¬ 
sions, writes: “Other historians state, with more probability, that 
Tatar Khan, taking advantage of the age and infirmities of his 
father, seized and imprisoned him in the town of Yessavul, since 
called Ahmudabad.” As Muzaffar had not till then declared him¬ 
self as king Tatar is regarded as the first king of the dynasty. 

Soon after his accession, Tatar proceeded towards Delhi. 
According to most of the authorities, on the way his uncle Shams 
Khan, brother of Muzaffar, poisoned him at Sinor in 1404. But 
again Nizjam-ud-dm gives a different account, according to which 
Tatar died of excessive drinking; but at the end of the section he 


156 


GUJARAT 


adds cryptically: “It has, however, come to (my) notice in vari¬ 
ous histories that Shams Khan Dandani gave poison to Muhammad 
Shah in his wine”. 2 The weight of evidence, therefore, supports 
the view that Tatar imprisoned his father to gain the throne and 
was later poisoned by the latter’s brother, Shams Khan. 

After the death of Tatar, Shams Khan released Muzaffar from 
the prison, and he took over the control of the administration with¬ 
out any difficulty. At last in A.D. 1407, at the request of the 
nobles, Muzaffar declared himself as Sultan Muzaffar Shah, took the 
insignia of royalty and issued coins in his own name. 3 

Soon after his accession, Muzaffar invaded Malwa, entered the 
capital city Dhar, and imprisoned Sultan Hushang of Malwa. In 
this Muzaffar was prompted by a desire to avenge the death of 
his old friend Dilavar Khan, who was said to have been murder¬ 
ed by his son Hushang. Later, Muzaffar restored Hushang to the 
throne of Malwa, as will be related below. 

According to the Muslim historians, Muzaffar subdued the 
Hindu state of Idar. According to the Kumbhalgarh inscription 
of A.D. 1400, Rana Kshetrasimha of Chitor defeated Ranamalla, the 
king of Gurjaramandala (i.e. Idar), victor of Dafara Khan, the lord of 
Pattana. 4 This Dafara Khana has been identified with Zafar Khan, 
that is Muzaffar Khan who is called by his old name Zafar 
Khan in some histories. 

Muzaffar died in 813 A.H. (A.D. 1410-1411) and was succeeded by 
his grandson Ahmad, the son of Tatar Khan. According to the Mirdt - 
i-Sikandari, “it was commonly reported and believed” that Ahmad 
had poisoned his grandfather. According to other historians such as 
Nizam-ud-din and Firishta, Muzaffar, after a severe illness, abdicated 
in favour of his grandson and died peacefully a few months later. 

2. AHMAD SHAH (A.D. 1411-1443) 

Sultan Ahmad enjoyed a prosperous reign of thirty-two-years, 
the greater part of which was spent in warfare against the Hindu 
Rajas of Gujarat and Rajputana and the Muslim rulers of Malwa 
and the Deccan. Soon after his accession Ahmad was faced with a 
rebellion of his uncles, the eldest of whom, Firuz Khan, had de¬ 
clared himself king. Ahmad took energetic steps to crush the re¬ 
bellion, and soon the rebel troops began to desert in large numbers 
and join the royal standard. Ultimately Firuz and his brothers 
had to surrender to Ahmad, who not only pardoned them but res¬ 
tored them to their former status. 


157 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


During this rebellion Sultan Hushang of Malwa invaded Guja¬ 
rat in the hope of reaping advantage from the distracted condition 
of the country. According to some authorities Ahmad had summon¬ 
ed Hushang to his aid, while others relate that the rebels had invi¬ 
ted Hushang. However, after the rebellion was put down Hushang 
promptly retired to Malwa, but again invaded Gujarat while Ahmad 
was away from his capital in a campaign against the Raja of Jha- 
lawar. Hushang, however, was again forced to retreat. These, as 
well as the next invasion of Hushang, will be described in the chap¬ 
ter on Malwa. 

During the confusion created by the second invasion of Hushang, 
a Gujarati noble named Sher Malik rebelled and, being defeated, took 
shelter with the Hindu king of Girnar. Saurashtra, it may be noted, 
was under the rule of petty Hindu chieftains who had not yet 
submitted to the Muslim rule. Ahmad, therefore, took this as an 
opportunity to invade Girnar. The king of Girnar was defeated in 
the field, but the hill-fort of Girnar held out against a siege, and 
ultimately Ahmad had to be satisfied by the promise of a tribute, 
for at this time trouble arose elsewhere. According to the 
Mandalika-nripa-charita 5 Ahmad had to retire with a serious loss of 
war equipments and materials. He seems to have renewed his at¬ 
tack later and succeeded to the extent of forcing the Raja to pay him 
tribute (A.D. 1414-1415). 

The ruler of Khandesh had died in 1399, dividing his territory 
between his two sons Nasir and Iftikhar or Hasan. In 1417, Naslr 
with the help of Hushang of Malwa, occupied his brother’s territory 
and imprisoned him before the latter could obtain any help from 
Ahmad to whom he had appealed. Naslr and the Malwa army then 
attacked Sultanpur in Gujarat but retired before a relieving force 
sent by Ahmad. The Gujarat army then besieged Naslr in his fort 
of Asir, and after some time peace was concluded on Nasir’s swear¬ 
ing fealty to Ahmad, and promising to abstain in future from aggres¬ 
sion. Ahmad, in return recognized Nasir’s claim over the whole 
of Khandesh, and Iftikhar retired to Gujarat. 

Ahmad, like his grandfather, was a bigot and seized every 
opportunity to demolish Hindu temples. In 1414, he appointed one 
Taj-ul-Mulk to destroy all temples and to establish Muslim authority 
throughout Gujarat. According to Firishta, the task was “executed 
with such diligence that the names of Mawass and Girass (i.e. Hindu 
zamindars) were hereafter unheard of in the whole kingdom.” Next 
year Ahmad attacked the celebrated city of Sidlipur in north Guja¬ 
rat where he broke the images in the famous Rudramahalaya temple 
and converted it into a mosque. These fanatic measures led the 


158 


GUJARAT 

chiefs of Champaner, Madal or Mandalgrah, Nandod and Idar to 
form a league against Ahmad in 1416, and they obtained support 
from Sultan Hushang of Malwa who was extremely jealous of Guja¬ 
rat Sultanate. Hushang advanced with an army as far as Madasa, 
but ultimately retired without engaging Ahmad, who arrived there 
by forced marches. 

Naslr of Khandesh, who had attacked Nandurbar, was also 
forced to retire. Ahmad pardoned him on discovering that Naslr 
was prompted to attack Gujarat by Hushang’s son who had also 
supplied him with troops. The Hindu Rajas were also dispersed. 
Ahmad then invaded Malwa to punish Hushang and led three ex¬ 
peditions in A.D. 1419, 1420 and 1422. But save that the Gujarat 
army devastated parts of Malwa, nothing worthy of note was 
accomplished. 

Ahmad led another expedition into Malwa at the end of his 
reign in A.D. 1438, when he attempted to place on the throne of 
Malwa prince Mas £ ud, son of Sultan Ghazni Khan of Malwa, who 
had been murdered by Mahmud Khalji. But after many months of 
fruitless campaigning he was obliged to retire owing to an outbreak 
of pestilence in his army. 

In 1429, Kanha (Krishna) Raja of Jhalawar, on account of the 
policy of Ahmad towards the Hindus, sought help from Ahmad 
Shah BahmanI who dispatched a force against Gujarat. The Raja 
of Jhalawar, with the help of the BahmanI army, ravaged Nandurbar, 
whereupon Ahmad sent a strong force against them. In the en¬ 
suing battle the Deccan army was completely defeated and fled to 
Daulatabad. Ahmad Shah BahmanI sent strong reinforcements and 
was joined by Naslr Khan of Khandesh, but again the Deccan army 
was defeated. Thus began the conflict between Gujarat and the 
BahmanI empire, lasting for about two years, the ultimate result of 
which was that Gujarat annexed Tirana and Mahim. 

Of all the Hindu States which were subdued by Ahmad, Idar 
put up the greatest resistance. In 1426, Ahmad drove the Raja, Rao 
Punja, out of his capital into the hills. Punja died two years later 
during a skirmish in the hills, but his sons carried on the struggle. 
Ultimately, however, they were forced to submit and promised to 
pay tribute. 

In 1432, Ahmad undertook his last great campaign against 
the Hindu powers. He is said by the Muslim historians to have 
defeated the ruler of Panagarh, destroyed the town of Nandod, and 
exacted tributes from the rulers of Dungarpur, Kotah and Bundl. 
The ruler of Dungarpur at this time was Maharawal Goplnatha or 
Gajapal. But in an inscription, dated V.S. 1525 (A.D. 1468), it is 


159 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


claimed that Gopinatha defeated the haughty ( madamatta ) Sultan 
of Gujarat and seized his treasure. 6 

The Kumbhalgarh inscription of A.D. 1460 states that Rana 
Mokalendra defeated Piroja and Mahammada who have been identi¬ 
fied with Firuz Khan of Nagaur and Ahmad Shah of Gujarat, respec¬ 
tively. 7 The Shringi-Rishi inscription of Mokala of A.D. 1428 
states: “(It was he, Mokala) from whose presence Piroja Khan a 
(Firuz Khan) himself had resorted to fleeing, (and) Patasaha 

Ahmada, although irresistible in battle. abandoning (his) 

.has at present, with face dried up, with hair dishevelled, with 

speech obstructed . . . taken refuge in the habitation of a mountain 
cave in order to save 8 . .. .” The Chitorgarh inscription of Mokala 
issued in the same year also refers to his victory over Piroja. 9 

According to the Muslim historians, Firuz and Ahmad defeated 
Mokala in A.D. 1433, whereas Mokala’s inscriptions recording his 
victories are dated A.D. 1428. Either, therefore, the Muslim histo¬ 
rians gave wrong dates, or Ahmad led two expeditions against 
Mewar, in the first of which he was defeated but won the second. 

Sultan Ahmad died in A.D. 1443 and was succeeded by his 
eldest son Mu‘izz-ud-dm Muhammad Shah. Sultan Ahmad is chiefly 
remembered today as the founder of the city of Ahmadabad where 
he transferred the capital from Anahilwara at the beginning of his 
reign. 

3. MUHAMMAD SHAH II (A.D. 1443-51) 

Muhammad II took up the unfinished task of Ahmad of subdu¬ 
ing the Hindu chieftains of Gujarat. He first led a campaign 
against idar and forced its ruler to submit to his authority. The 
Raja of Idar, Hari Rai or Bir Rai, is said to have purchased peace 
by marrying his daughter to Muhammad. Muhammad is then said 
to have gone and exacted tribute from the Raja of Dungarpur. 
According to Sir E, Dennison Ross “Muhammad next attacked, at 
Bagor, Rana Kumbha of Mewar, who fled and took refuge with the 
Rawal of Dungarpur, the chief of his house, but afterwards appear¬ 
ed before the invader and purchased peace with a heavy indem¬ 
nity”. This statement has no evidence in its support, and on the 
available material it is apparent that Muhammad defeated not 
Kumbha but Ganesa of Dungarpur. 10 

In A.D. 1449, Muhammad marched against Champaner, but the 
Raja, Kanak Das, having obtained help from Malwa, forced him to 
retreat. On his return journey Muhammad fell seriously ill and 
died in February 1451. According to some historians he was poi¬ 
soned by his wife. 


160 




GUJARAT 


4. QUTB-UD-DIN AHMAD SHAH OR AHMAD SHAH II 

(A.D. 1451-58) 

After the death of Muhammad II his son ascended the throne 
under the title of Qutb-ud-dln Ahmad Shah. Sultan Mahmud 
Khalji of Malwa, who had advanced up to the frontiers of Gujarat 
at the invitation of Raja Kanak Das, now invaded the country and 
advanced up to Broach. 11 Unable to capture this fortress, Mahmud 
marched towards the capital, but on his way was severely defeated 
by Qutb-ud-dln and fled, leaving eighty-one elephants and all his 
baggage. 

In 1453, taking advantage of a dispute for succession among 
the kinsmen of Qutb-ud-dln who held Nagaur, Maharana Kumbha 
occupied the territory. Shams Khan, the ruler of Nagaur, sought the 
protection of Qutb-ud-dln, who dispatched an army against the 
Maharana, but the latter defeated and almost destroyed the Gujarat 
army. In 1456, therefore, Qutb-ud-dln marched against Kumbhal- 
garh to avenge his defeat, and though he could not capture the 
famous fort, it is claimed by the Muslim historians that the Maha¬ 
rana was obliged to purchase peace by the payment of a huge tribute. 
The same authorities then state, that on his return from Kumbhal- 
garh, Qutb-ud-din learnt that during his absence Ghiyas-ud-din, the 
son of Mahmud Khalji of Malwa, had raided Gujarat as far as 
Surat, but had retired on learning of his return. Later in the same 
year, however, Mahmud sent a mission to Gujarat proposing a 
treaty of alliance between the two kingdoms against Chitor. It was 
decided that the Gujarat army should plunder and ravage such parts 
of the territories of the Maharana as were contiguous to Gujarat 
while Mahmud should seize the country of Mewar and Ajmer. 
Accordingly next year (1457) Qutb-ud-dln again advanced against 
Kumbhalgarh. 

Maharana Kumbha, on learning the approach of the Gujarat 
army, left Kumbhalgarh and took up a strong position between that 
place and Chitor. Here a battle was fought for two days at the 
end of which the Maharana, according to the Muslim historians, fled 
to jungle and ultimately concluded peace by paying a huge ran¬ 
som. Qutb-ud-dln then returned to Gujarat. Within three months 
Maharana Kumbha attacked Nagaur, but retired on the approach of 
Qutb-ud-dln with his main army. 

Some time later Qutb-ud-din attacked Sirohi which was ruled 
by a relation of the Maharana. After burning Sirohi and ravaging 
other towns on his way Qutb-ud-din besieged the famous fort of 
Kumbhalgarh, while his ally, Sultan Mahmud Khalji of Malwa ad¬ 
vanced towards Chitor. Soon Qutb-ud-din found that it was beyond 

161 


D.S.—11 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


his power to reduce the Kumbhalgarh fort, and advanced towards 
Chitor but returned to his capital after plundering a few towns 
around it. Nizam-ud-dln states that “Rana Kumbha sent ambassa¬ 
dors after the Sultan and in great humility and distress prayed to be 
excused for his offences and the Sultan again drew the pen of for¬ 
giveness across his guilt; and sent back the ambassadors pleased 
and happy.” 

Thus, according to the Muslim historians, Qutb-ud-din always 
defeated the Maharana. On the other hand the Rajputs claim that 
Maharana Kumbha defeated Qutb-ud-din. 12 The Chitor Klrtis- 
tambha inscription (part II, verses 16-23) states that the Maharana 
destroyed the town of Nagapura (Nagaur) and the lofty masiti 
(mosque) built by Piroja (Firuz Khan), captured many Muslim 
women, and took possession of the treasures of Shams Khan while 
fighting in the country of Jangala, and harassed the king of Gujarat. 
Verse 172 of the same inscription states: “Kumbha, the lord of 
the earth, (who is like) the sage Agastya (one born in a pitcher) 
to the multitude of the forest of all the elephants (which were) 
arrayed or not arrayed (but were) submerged in the ocean in the 
form of the proud Sultans of Gujarat and Malwa; (that Kumbha) 
is shining, this king who deserves to be praised as a preceptor initiat¬ 
ing the kings in the commencement of battle”. 13 

It is apparent that the verses 16-23 relate the first invasion of 
Qutb-ud-din, and verse 172 refers to the joint expedition sent by 
Gujarat and Malwa. The Rajput version seems nearer the truth, as 
otherwise it is difficult to explain as to why after his first victorious 
campaign against the Maharana, Qutb-ud-din should have concluded 
a treaty with the Sultan of Malwa, his hereditary enemy, parti¬ 
cularly when the latter had raided his kingdom during his absence. 

5. DAUD KHAN AND MAHMUD BEGARHA (A.D. 1458-1511) 

Qutb-ud-din died in 1458, and after his death the nobles raised 
his uncle Baud Khan to the throne. However, within the short 
period of seven or twenty-seven days, Baud proved himself to be 
such an imbecile that the nobles deposed him and set on the throne 
Fath Khan, son of Muhammad II (1458). Fath Khan, on his acces¬ 
sion, adopted the title of Abu-’l Fath Mahmud and is famous in his¬ 
tory as Mahmud Begarha. 

Soon after his accession Mahmud was faced with a conspiracy 
which aimed at removing him and placing his younger brother on 
the throne. With great presence of mind he cleverly frustrated 
the conspiracy. 


162 


GUJARAT 


In A.D. 1461, Mahmud Khaljl of Malwa invaded the dominions 
of the infant Bahmani king, Nizam Shah, and an appeal was sent 
to Mahmud Begarha for help. Mahmud Begarha marched into 
Khandesh and cut off the retreat of the Malwa army, which was 
compelled to retire through Berar and suffered terribly. Next year 
Mahmud Khaljl of Malwa again invaded the Deccan, but retreated 
on hearing that Mahmud Begarha was marching against him. Mah¬ 
mud Begarha then wrote to Mahmud Khaljl that it was unfair to 
molest a child, that is Nizam Shah, and that if he ever attacked the 
latter's dominion, Malwa would be overrun by the Gujarat army. 
The threat was effective in preventing further hostilities between 
Malwa and the Bahmani kingdom. 

In 1466 Mahmud invaded the territory of king Mandalika, usual¬ 
ly known as the Chudasama king of Girnar. But from the recently 
discovered Mandalika-nripa-charita it is learnt that Mandalika 
belonged to the Yadava race. The same work informs us that 
Mandalika tried his best to be on good terms with Mahmud, and 
once at Mahmud’s behest attacked and killed one king Duda whose 
adopted daughter he (Mandalika) had married. 14 Still in 1467, 
Mahmud invaded Mandalika’s territory, defeated his army and sack¬ 
ed a city. Mandalika then sued for peace which he obtained by 
agreeing to pay tribute. In the following year Mahmud forbade 
Mandalika the use of royal insignias which the unfortunate prince 
immediately obeyed. Yet in 1469 Mahmud again attacked Juna- 
garh. Mandalika appealed to Mahmud, pointing out that he had 
remitted tribute regularly and had been an obedient vassal. Mah¬ 
mud replied that he had not come for money but for the propagation 
of Islam in Saurashtra, and offered Mandalika the choice between 
death and Islam. Mandalika at first resisted, but after the fall of his 
last retreat, the fort of Girnar, he surrendered and accepted Islam. 
Mandalika’s kingdom was incorporated in the dominions of Gujarat. 
Mahmud stayed at Junagarh for some time, improved the defences 
of the city and renamed it Mustafabad, which henceforth became 
one of his capitals, specially intended for the propagation of Islam 
in this region. 

News now reached Mahmud that while he had been besieging 
Girnar, Jayasbhha, the son of the Raja of Champaner, had been 
ravaging the territory between Champaner, and Ahmadabad. 
Mahmud immediately sent an officer to protect the region and inten¬ 
ded to follow with a view to conquer Champaner. But complaints 
came from southern Sind that the Muslims were being persecuted 
by the Hindus. Mahmud therefore crossed the Rann of Cutch and, 
entering the region now known as the Thar and Parkar districts, 


163 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Was confronted with an army of 24,000 horse which was composed 
of Sumras, Sodas and Kalhoras. The leader of this army informed 
Mahmud that ‘‘they were Muslims but knew little of their faith or 
its rules, and were wont to intermarry with and live as Hindus. 
He invited those, who would, to enter his service and to return 
with him to Gujarat, and many accepted his invitation and received 
grants of land in Sorath, where teachers were appointed to instruct 
them in the faith of Islam.” 

In A.D. 1472, Mahmud again marched into Sind to aid his 

y • 

maternal grandfather Jam Nanda against rebels. This campaign, in 
which he was entirely successful, will be described later in the 
chapter on Sind. 

About this time a learned poet and merchant named Mahmud 

Samarqandi had been driven ashore to Dvaraka, the holy city of the 

Hindus associated with Sri Krishna. The Hindus of Dvaraka rob- 

• • 

bed Samarqandi of all his goods whereupon he appealed in person 
to Mahmud for redress. So Mahmud marched to Dvaraka which 
was evacuated by its king, Bhima, who took refuge in the island 
fortress of Bet Shankhodhar. Mahmud, after destroying the 
temple at Dvaraka and plundering the city, proceeded towards Bet 
Shankhodhar through a dense forest where his army was put to 
great difficulties by the lions and poisonous snakes. However, 
Mahmud won a sea-fight and the Hindus had to surrender the fort¬ 
ress for lack of provisions. The place was thoroughly pillaged, 
and Bhima was sent to Ahmadabad where he was impaled. 

In 1480, the officers, tired of Mahmud’s ceaseless energy, con¬ 
spired to dethrone him and put his son on the throne. Mahmud 
learnt of this conspiracy at Mustiafabad, where he spent a part of 
each year, and decided to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca. However, 
the courtiers, ashamed of their conduct, then begged Mahmud to 
change his decision and, after some parleys, it was decided that 
Mahmud should conquer Champaner which he had raided in 1474 
and collect enough money to defray his expenses for the voyage 
to Mecca. But Champaner was not attacked till A.D. 1482, when 
Malik Sudha, a Gujarati officer, plundered and laid it waste nearly 
to the walls of the fortress, slaying the inhabitants. As he was 
returning, Jayasimha, 15 the king of Champaner, attacked and slew 
him, recovered all his plundered booty, took two elephants, and 
sacked and destroyed Rasulabad where Malik Sudha had been the 
governor. Mahmud, on hearing of this defeat decided to attack 
Champaner and started towards it with his army on December 4, 
1482. 


164 


GUJARAT 


After defeating the Champaner army Mahmud captured the 
town and besieged Pavagarh, the famous hill-fortress above Cham¬ 
paner, where the king had taken refuge. Mahmud plundered the 
whole country and, refusing repeated offers of submission by Raja 
Jayasimha, captured Pavagarh after a siege of twenty months 
(November, 1484). The women committed janhar and most of the 
men fell fighting, but the unfortunate king of Champaner and his 
minister were wounded and captured. According to Firishta, 
Mahmud asked the wounded Raja as to “what could induce him to 
hold out so long, before so large a force. The Raja replied with 
undaunted firmness: T hold this territory by hereditary right, and 
being descended from a line of noble ancestors, have been taught 
to respect that name which they handed down to me. I determined, 
therefore, not to act in a way so as to disgrace my family.’ Mah¬ 
mud, admiring this spirited and manly conduct, ordered every 
attention to be paid to the Raja’s wants and comforts.” After the 
Raja’s wounds had healed, Mahmud tried to persuade him and his 
minister to embrace Islam. But the noble warriors were steadfast 
in their refusal, preferring death to abjuring their faith. At the 
end of five months Mahmud ordered them to be put to death. Jaya- 
sirhha’s son accepted Islam, and in the next reign became the Amir 
of Idar receiving the title of Nizam-ul-Mulk. 

With the conquest of Champaner, which Mahmud renamed 
Muhammadabad, the kingdom of Gujarat reached its extreme 
limits till the conquest of Malwa. It seems that after the conquest 
of Champaner, Mahmud received the sobriquet of Begarha, that is 
the conqueror of two forts, Girnar and Champaner, on the opposite 
sides of his kingdom. 

During the remaining twenty-five years of his reign (A.D. 1485- 
1511), Mahmud was engaged in several military operations. Of 
these one of the most important was directed against Bahadur Gilam, 
a noble of the Bahmani empire, who seized the whole of Konkan 
and not only committed various acts of piracy off the Gujarat 
coast for several years (1491-1494), but actually carried on depre¬ 
dations as far as Cambay and seized the island of Mahim. Mah¬ 
mud first attempted to send an army against Gilam, which had to re¬ 
turn without fulfilling its task, as it was found that in order to attack 
Gilam the Gujarat army would have to invade the Deccan. Mahmud, 
therefore, wrote to the Bahmani king reminding him of the claims 
which Gujarat had on the gratitude of his house and requesting Mah¬ 
mud Shah Bahmani to suppress the rebel. The Bahmani king in res¬ 
ponse to this sent an army against GllanI, but it was not till 1494 


165 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 

that GllanI was defeated and slain and full reparations were made 
to Gujarat. 

But very soon Gujarat had to face a strong naval power namely, 
the Portuguese. By the discovery of the direct sea route they had 
been able to strike a blow against the lucrative trade wnich passed 
through Egypt and Red Sea to India. The port of Cambay was 
seriously affected, as the Portuguese were diverting the trade to 
Cochin where they had erected a fort in 1506. Thus the Portu¬ 
guese incurred the hostility of all the Muslim powers on the Arabian 
Sea who now determined to oust them. So, after a protracted 
negotiation, an Egyptian fleet was equipped at Suez and sent to 
India under the command of Amir Husain to join the Gujarat navy 
under the Turkish admiral, Malik Ayaz. 

The Portuguese admiral at this time in India was Francesco 
d’ Almeida. He sent his gallant son, Don Lorenzo, in 1508 to explore 
the coast as far north as Gujarat. While Lorenzo was lying with 
a small squadron in the shelter of the harbour of Chaul near Bom¬ 
bay, news reached him that the Egyptian fleet had reached Diu 
and had been joined by Malik Ayaz. The combined fleet encoun¬ 
tered Lorenzo in the harbour off Chaul in January 1508. After 
a fierce engagement the Portuguese were defeated and Lorenzo 
lost his life. 

To avenge this defeat and his son’s death, d’ Almeida appear¬ 
ed the following year with a stronger force, and a decisive action 
was fought near the island of Diu in which the combined Muslim 
navy suffered a disastrous defeat. Mahmud then attempted to res¬ 
tore peaceful relations with the Portuguese and sent an envoy for 
this purpose in September 1510. But presumably the Portuguese 
demanded some proof of Mahmud’s peaceful intentions, so when 
on November 25, 1510, the Portuguese captured Goa from the 
‘Adil Shah! Sultans of Bljapur, Mahmud forthwith ended his alli¬ 
ance with Egypt and granted permission to the commander of the 
Egyptian fleet to return. He also released all the Portuguese pri¬ 
soners captured at Chaul. 

In 1510, an embassy arrived from Ibrahim Lodi to congratu¬ 
late him on his success at Khandesh, where Mahmud had firmly 
established his suzerainty by a series of wars from 1500, as will 
be related later. In 1511, a mission from Shah Isma‘il I Safavi of 
Persia came, but it is said that Mahmud, who was a bigoted 
Sunni, refused to receive the Persian ambassador. He was, how¬ 
ever, ill when the Persian mission arrived, and died shortly after 
on November 23, 1511. 


166 


GUJARAT 


Mahmud is usually regarded as the greatest Sultan of Gujarat. 
Ascending the throne at a very early age, he distinguished him¬ 
self as much by his astute statesmanship as by his military skill. 
He was, however, a bigot like his predecessors and persecuted the 
Hindus. Though he gained great successes against unimportant 
and scattered Hindu chiefs, he signally failed against the Portu¬ 
guese and did not realize the menace the latter were to be to his 
descendants. 

Mahmud presented a striking appearance with a flowing 
beard that reached his waist, and his moustache was so long that 
he tied it over his head, which, according to some authorities 
gave rise to the sobriquet Begarha. To satisfy his proverbially 
voracious appetite, he used to eat daily between ten to fifteen seers 
of food and, at night, placed another two pounds of rice on either 
side of his bed so that he might find something to eat on whichever 
side he awoke from sleep. For breakfast he took a cup of honey, 
a cup of butter, and from 100 to 150 plantains. 

6. MUZAFFAR SHAH II (A.D . 1511-26) 

Mahmud was succeeded by his son Khalil Khan who adopted 
the title of Muzaffar Shah II. Soon after his accession, Muzaffar 
promised to interfere in the affairs of Malwa to install on the 
throne the fugitive prince Sahib Khan, the elder brother of the 
reigning Malwa king Mahmud II. But soon Sahib left Gujarat 
as he was implicated in a scandal in which the Persian ambassador 
was involved, and his brother Mahmud II appealed to Muzaffar 
for help against his domineering Hindu officers. 

While Muzaffar was marching towards Malwa, news reached 
him that Bhlmasimha of idar had raided the whole country east 
of the Sabarmati river and had defeated a Gujarat contingent. 
Muzaffar therefore marched against Idar, defeated and drove 
Bhlmasimha to the hills and reached his capital. Later Bhima 
purchased peace by paying a heavy indemnity. In A.D. 1515 
Bhlmasimha died and was succeeded by his son BharmaV 6 
Bhlmasimha had usurped the throne of his nephew Raimal who 
now went to Rana Sanga of Mewar and appealed for help. Sanga 
thereupon sent his army to Idar and set up Raimal on the 
throne. Muzaffar then sent an army under Nizam-ul-Mulk which 
expelled Raimal and restored Bharmal but, while pursuing the 
defeated army in the hills, the Gujarat army suffered a disastrous 
defeat. Soon after Maharana Sanga attacked Idar and restored 
Raimal. 17 


167 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


According to the Mimt-i-Sikandafi, next year Muzaffar sent an 
expedition against Rawal Udayasimha of Vagada to chastise him for 
having helped Maharana Sanga. The Gujarat army, according to 
the same authority, won splendid victories in Dungarpur and Bans- 
wara. 

During this time the Hindus under MedinI Rai had firmly 
taken the administration of Malwa under their control, and Sul¬ 
tan Mahmud II, unable to free himself from their dominance, 
secretly left Malwa and arrived at Gujarat. Muzaffar received 
him cordially and promised him help. Medini Rai went to Chitor 
to bring aid from Maharana Sahga, but during his absence, the 
Gujarat army under Muzaffar captured Mandu and restored 
Mahmud on the throne. 

According to the Muslim sources, Maharana Sahga and Medini 
Rai, terror-struck at the news of the fall of Mandu, turned and 
fled. But according to the Rajput sources the Maharana, who had 
promised to march to the frontier of Malwa and to see that no 
harm was done to Medini Rai, decided after the fall of Mandu that 
nothing further could be done and returned to Chitor with Medini 
Rai. He, however, bestowed on Medini Rai, who later fought 
against Babur, several pargands including Gagron and Chanderl. 18 

In A.D. 1519, Maharana Sahga inflicted a crushing defeat upon 
Mahmud II of Malwa and a Gujarat contingent of 10,000 horse 
and took the former captive. On hearing this, Muzaffar sent 
reinforcements to Malwa, but their service was not required, for 
the great Maharana had generously restored Mahmud to the throne 
of Malwa. 

Mubariz-ul-Mulk, who was sent by Muzaffar to relieve the Guja¬ 
rat army at Idar, had once spoken very disparagingly of the Maha¬ 
rana which was reported to the latter. It is said that to avenge 
this insult the Maharana marched on Idar and occupied it, the 
Muslim army having fled to Ahmadnagar. The Rajput army then 
advanced upon Ahmadnagar, captured the city after a stiff fight, 
sacked it, and carried away its inhabitants as prisoners. 19 The 
Maharana then proceeded further and captured Vadnagar, but the 
citizens being mostly Brahmins, that city was spared. From there 
the Maharana led his army on to Visalnagar, defeated the garri¬ 
son, and plundered the town, after which he returned to Mewar. 

To avenge this defeat, Muzaffar next year raised a huge army 
and sent it under Malik Ayaz to invade Mewar. Malik Ayaz, join¬ 
ed by the ungrateful Mahmud II of Malwa, besieged Mandasor. 
As this place was included within the domains of the Maharana, 
he also arrived with his army. Some time later the siege was 
raised and the Muslim armies retired to their respective capitals. 


168 


KHANDESH 


It has been held on the basis of Muslim sources that Maharana 
Sanga “would not venture within twenty miles of the Muslim 
camp, and sent agents to Malik Ayaz offering to pay tribute to 
Muzaffar II if he would raise the siege, but his prayers were unheed¬ 
ed.’’ Ultimately, according to the same authority, due to the apprehen¬ 
sion on the part of Malik Ayaz, lest one of his lieutenants 
should gain the credit for victory, “he made peace with the Maha¬ 
rana on his promising to pay tribute, to place a son at Muzaffar’s 
court as a hostage, to wait in person on the king, and to be obedi¬ 
ent to his orders/’ But “Muzaffar was so deeply disappointed by 
this termination of a promising campaign that he would not see 
Malik Ayaz, and sent him straight back to Sorath.” 20 The Rajput 
sources, on the other hand, claim that the joint Muslim army re¬ 
treated out of fear. 21 As Maharana Sanga was strong enough to 
face Babur within about five years of this incident, the version of 
the Muslim historians seems to be fanciful. Moreover, the Rajput 
version explains adequately the disgrace of Malik Ayaz. It may 
also be noted, that Bahadur, the son of Muzaffar, took refuge in 
Chitor when he fled from Gujarat. 

The rest of Muzaffar’s reign was uneventful. In 1524 his 
second son Bahadur demanded equal allowance with his eldest 
brother Sikandar, the heir-designate. As this was not conceded 
Bahadur fled from Gujarat and sought refuge at Chitor where he 
was hospitably received. Later he went to Delhi and was most 
probably present at the battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526). 

Muzaffar died on April 5, 1526, and was succeeded by his 
eldest son Sikandar. 


B. KHANDESH 

The principality of Khandesh was established by one Malik 
Raja, the son of Khan Jahan Faruqi, a nobleman who flourished 
in the time of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl and Muhammad Tughluq. As 
Malik Raja claimed descent from Caliph ‘Umar Faruq, the 
dynasty is known as Faruqi. Malik Raja had in his youth attract¬ 
ed the notice of Firuz Tughluq during a chase where he was able 
to supply the hungry Sultan with some food. As a reward the grate¬ 
ful monarch conferred on Malik Raja the districts of Thalner and 
Kuronde situated on the borders of the Deccan. 1 

Malik Raja took possession of Thalner in A.D. 1370 and soon 
after forced the Hindu king of Baglana to pay an annual tribute 
to the Sultan of Delhi. Firuz Tughluq was so pleased with the 
young officer that he honoured him with the title of Sipah Salar 
of Khandesh and raised him to the rank of a commander of three 


169 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


thousand horse. Within a few years the enterprising Sipah Salar 
was able to muster twelve thousand horse and raise contributions 
from neighbouring Hindu kings. 

After the death of Firuz Tughluq, Malik Raja seems to have 
declared his independence, and in order to strengthen his position, 
entered into a matrimonial alliance with Malwa, his son Nasir Khan 
being married to the daughter of Sultan Dilavar Shah of Malwa. 
Soon after, Malik Raja, relying on the support of Dilavar, invaded 
Gujarat, but was forced to retreat and seek refuge in the fort of 
Thalner where he was closely besieged by Muzaffar Shah of Gujarat. 
Later, however, he was able to conclude peace with Muzaffar. 

The rest of his life Malik Raja spent in developing his kingdom. 
He became a disciple of saint Zain-ud-din of Daulatabad from whom 
he received the “garb of desire and assent”, which became an insignia 
of the chiefs of Khandesh. Shortly before his death which took place 
in A.D. 1399 he nominated his elder son Nasir Khan as his successor 
and gave him the robe, but bestowed on his younger son, Iftikhar, 2 
the fort and district of Thalner. 

Nasir Khan began his reign by treacherously capturing the 
strong fortress of Asir from its Hindu chieftain, for which he was 
warmly congratulated by the saint Zain-ud-din who came up to the 
eastern bank of the Tapti to see Nasir. As the saint refused to cross 
the river, a city was built there called Zainabad, while on the west¬ 
ern bank, where Nasir was camped, was constructed the more 
famous city of Burhanpur, named after another saint, Shaikh 
Burhan-ud-din. 

In 1417, Nasir was able to secure help from his brother-in-law, 
Sultan Hushang of Malwa, for an attack upon Thalner, his brother’s 
domain. Iftikhar remonstrated with his brother and then sought 
in vain the help of Ahmad Shah of Gujarat. Soon the fort of 
Thalner fell, and Nasir imprisoned Iftikhar. The combined Malwa 
and Khandesh army then invaded Gujarat and invested the fort of 
Sultanpur. This forced Sultan Ahmad of Gujarat to take prompt 
action. He collected a considerable army and marched south, which 
forced the Malwa general to flee with his contingent, and Nasir to 
retire to the fort of Thalner. Soon Nasir was reduced to such a 
state that he had to conclude peace, which was granted to him on 
his acknowledging the suzerainty of the Sultan of Gujarat, who 
bestowed on him the title of Khan, the white canopy and scarlet 
pavillion. As the descendants of Nasir always called themselves 
Khan, the country came to be known as Khandesh (country of the 
Khans). 


170 


KHANDESH 


A few years later Nasir formed a matrimonial alliance with 
Ahmad Shah Bahmani by marrying his daughter to latter’s son ‘Ala- 
ud-din. Thus when, in 1429, Kanha (Krishna), the king of Jhalawar, 
fled from Gujarat, as mentioned above, and arrived at Asir seek¬ 
ing help, Nasir, afraid of Gujarat’s power, sent Kanha with a letter 
to the Bahmani king. Ahmad Shah Bahmani immediately took up 
Kanha s cause and helped him with a small force which ravaged 
Nandurbar, but soon after was severely defeated by the Gujarat 
army. To retrieve his honour, Ahmad Shah Bahmani sent a larger 
force under the command of his son ‘Ala-ud-din who was joined 
by his father-in-law, Nasir. The allied army then marched on to 
Gujarat, but again suffered a defeat. The war between the Bah- 
manis and Gujarat continued for some time after this, but Nasir took 
no further part in their quarrel. 

In 1436, Nasir received complaints from his daughter that she 
was being ill treated by her husband ‘Ala-ud-din, now the Bahmani 
king. Nasir thereupon suspended all friendly relations with the 
Deccan kingdom, and next year attacked it at the instance of the 
king of Gujarat. He first entered Berar, and exploiting the differ¬ 
ences that existed amongst the Deccani nobles, gained some notable 
successes and had the khutba read in his own name. But soon after 
he had to retire precipitately in face of a large Bahmani army under 
Malik-ut-Tujjar. Nasir was pursued to Burhanpur, which was 
sacked by the Deccan army, and ultimately had to take refuge in 
his frontier fortress, Laling, and appealed to Gujarat and Malwa 
for help. But Malik-ut-Tujjar, determined to attack him before any 
outside help could arrive, pushed on by forced marches and reached 
Laling with only about three thousand men. Nasir, who had only 
about two thousand men with him, immediately attacked Malik-ut- 
Tujjar, but after a severe action was forced to retreat. He died a 
few days later (A.D. 1437). In spite of this reverse, Nasir Khan had 
been able to secure the position of his house and kingdom. He had 
wisely acknowledged the supremacy of Gujarat which saved his 
successors on several occasions. 

Nasir was succeeded by his son Miran ‘Adil Khan who sought 
the aid of Gujarat and Malwa. Shortly after a Gujarat army, arriv¬ 
ing at Sultanpur, compelled Malik-ut-Tujjar to raise the siege of 
Laling and retire to Deccan. After this, Miran ‘Adil Khan reigned 
for about three years and was most probably assassinated in 
A.D. 1441. He was succeeded by his son Miran Mubarak who reigned 
peacefully for sixteen years except for two campaigns against Bag- 
lana mentioned below, (p. 178). After his death in A.D. 1457, his 
eldest son ‘Adil Khan II came to the throne, and under him Khandesh 
attained greater prosperity than ever before. 


171 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


‘Adil Khan forced the Rajas of Gondwana and Garha-Mandla 
to acknowledge fealty to him and freed his country from the depre¬ 
dations of the Kolis and Bhlls. He also undertook considerable 
building activities, constructed the citadel of Burhanpur, and consi¬ 
derably strengthened the fortifications of Aslr. It was in conse¬ 
quence of the great strength which he had acquired that he assumed 
the title of Shdh-i-Jharkand (King of the Forest) 3 and, contrary to 
the practice of his ancestors, not only withheld the annual tribute 
to the king of Gujarat, but openly declared that he owed no allegi¬ 
ance to that monarch. As a result Mahmud Begarha of Gujarat 
marched into Khandesh with his army and forced ‘Adil to pay the 
arrears of tribute (A.D. 1498). Thereafter, till his death, five years 
later (April 8, 1503), 4 ‘Adil maintained friendly relations with 
Gujarat. 

‘Adil Khan died without any male issue, and was succeeded 
by his younger brother, Daud. Daud fell completely under the con¬ 
trol of two brothers, Husain ‘All and Yar ‘All, and appointed the 
former as the wdzir with the title Hisam-ud-dln. At the instigation 
of Hisam-ud-dln, Daud declared his intention of attacking Ahmad- 
nagar, whereupon Ahmad Nizam Shah invaded Khandesh. Daud 
then retired into the fort of Aslr and solicited help from Sultan 
Nasir-ud-din of Malwa. Naslr-ud-dm sent him sufficient help to in¬ 
duce the Nizam Shah! army to leave Khandesh, but Daud had to 
pay its price by having the khutba to be read in the name of Nasir- 
ud-dln. His inglorious reign came to an end with his death in 
A.D. 1510. His son Ghazni Khan succeeded him but after two days 
was poisoned by Hisam-ud-dm. 

As Ghazni Khan had no near male relations, some of the nobles 
selected one ‘Alam Khan, a scion of the Faruqi dynasty then re¬ 
siding at Ahmadnagar, as the king of Khandesh. ‘Alam Khan was 
backed by Ahmad Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar and ‘Imad-ud-Mulk 
of Berar. But ‘Adil, son of Hasan and grandson of Nasir Khan, 
also advanced his claim to the throne and was supported by his 
maternal grandfather Mahmud Begarha of Gujarat. ‘Alam received 
some help from Ahmadnagar and Berar but the Gujarat army was 
too powerful for him, so that he fled to Ahmadnagar. Mahmud there¬ 
upon placed ‘Adil on the throne of Khandesh with the title of A‘zam 
Humayun. 6 

‘Adil Khan III had some trouble with his nobles. Early in his 
reign he was faced with the disaffection of Hisam-ud-dln, one of the 
most powerful nobles. ‘Adil Khan had him murdered by some as¬ 
sailants, but some time later he found that the two Gujarati officers, 
whom he had left in charge of the fort of Aslr, had been conspiring 


172 


MALWA 


with Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar and the latter had actually arrived 
on the frontiers of Khandesh with ‘Alam Khan. 

‘Adil Khan immediately secured adequate help from his father- 
in-law, Muzaffar Shah II of Gujarat, and Ahmad Nizam Shah 
retreated. 

In 1517, ‘Adil Khan accompanied his father-in-law Muzaffar 
Shah to Malwa and distinguished himself in that campaign. The rest 
of his reign is uneventful. He died in 1520 and was succeeded by 
his son MIran Muhammad 6 whose mother was the daughter of 
Muzaffar Shah and sister of Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. 

C. MALWA 

I. THE GHuRi KINGS (A.D. 1401-35) 

The Sultanate of Malwa was established by Dilavar Khan 
Ghuri, of whose early history little is known. It appears that he 
was appointed governor of Malwa some time before A.D. 1390, either 
by Firuz Shah or his successor, and managed to establish his autho¬ 
rity over the province. During Timur’s invasion of India, Sultan 
Mahmud Tughluq first sought shelter with Muzaffar Shah of Gujarat, 
but not being received in the manner which the fugitive Sultan 
thought was his due, he left Gujarat and went to Malwa where 
Dilavar received him with all marks of honour due to a sovereign. 
This disgusted Dilavar’s son Alp Khan, who retired to Mandu and 
spent there the three years that Sultan Mahmud spent at Malwa. 
During this period Alp Khan laid the foundations of the fort of 
Mandu which later became one of the strongest forts in Malwa. 

Sultan Mahmud Tughluq returned to Delhi in A.D. 1401, after 
the departure of Timur, and shortly after Dilavar, at the instance 
of his son Alp Khan, declared independence and assumed the para¬ 
phernalia of royalty. 1 

Dilavar Khan died in A.D. 1405, 2 and was succeeded by his son 
Alp Khan who assumed the title of Hushang Shah. There was a 
rumour that Hushang had poisoned his father, and Muzaffar Shah 
of Gujarat took this up as a pretext for launching an attack on 
Malwa. Hushang resisted bravely but was defeated and taken pri¬ 
soner. Muzaffar Shah then left his (Muzaffar’s) brother Nusrat 
Khan as governor of Malwa and left for Gujarat taking Hushang 
away with him as a prisoner. 

Nusrat Khan’s rule, however, was so oppressive, that soon a 
rebellion broke out and he was obliged to leave Malwa. Hushang 
thereupon petitioned Muzaffar Shah to send him to Malwa, which 
he promised to subjugate on behalf of Muzaffar. Muzaffar then sent 

173 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to Malwa an army under his grandson Ahmad Khan to restore 
Hushang. 

Ahmad easily overcame all opposition, and after occupying 
Dhar, then the capital of Malwa, restored Hushang on his throne 
and left for Gujarat. Some rebels, however, still held out at Mandu 
under their leader Musa Khan. But the rebellion seems to have 
served its purpose with the return of Hushang, and soon his cousin 
Malik Mughis Khalji came out of Mandu and joined him. This dis¬ 
heartened Musa Khan who shortly after surrendered. Hushang 
then transferred the capital to Mandu and appointed Malik Mughis 
as his prime minister. 

In A.D. 1410-11 Sultan Muzaffar Shah of Gujarat died and was 
succeeded by his grandson Ahmad Shah, who was faced with a 
rebellion of his uncle. Hushang, as related above, sided with the 
rebels, but before he could join them, Ahmad had overawed his uncle 
with a show of force, and Hushang returned to Malwa without 
having accomplished anything. 

As Nizam-ud-dm says, “the sweats of shame and repentance 
had not yet dried up on the forehead of Hushang, when he again 
attempted the same kind of nefarious deed,” that is, invaded Gujarat. 
Ahmad was away in an expedition against the Hindu king of Jhal- 
awar, but the news of Hushang’s invasion forced him to return imme¬ 
diately and Hushang, receiving no help from the king of Jhalawar, 
returned to his kingdom. 

But soon after his return he was invited by a confederacy of 
Hindu kings of Champaner, Nandod, and Idar to invade Gujarat. 
The Hindu chieftains of Gujarat, oppressed by the bigoted Ahmad, 
also promised help, particularly to lead him into Gujarat secretly 
by an unfrequented road. The plan, however, miscarried; Ahmad 
came to learn of the invasion and took energetic measures to oppose 
Hushang, who once more returned disappointed to Malwa. He again 
raided Gujarat unsuccessfully in 1417 in alliance with his brother-in- 
law, Naslr Khan of Khandesh. 

Hushang appointed Mahmud Khan, the son of Malik Mughis 
Khalji, as the partner of the latter in the administration of the gov¬ 
ernment. This Mahmud Khan, as we shall see later, supplanted 
Hfishang’s dynasty. 

In A.D. 1421, Hushang is said to have gone to Orissa, disguised 
as a horse-dealer with only a retinue of one thousand men. He 
actually brought some fine horses of a type which the king of Orissa, 
Bhanudeva IV, prized very highly. As Bhanudeva came to inspect 
the horses, Hushang captured him and forced him to give him 

174 


MALWA 


seventy-five elephants. As a measure of further precaution, Hus- 
hang held captive the king of Orissa till he reached the border of his 
country. 

It was possibly during the return from this raid, that Hushang 
was severely beaten by Allada, the Reddi king of Rajahmundry. 
Allada’s court-poet Kommana declares in the Sivavildsam that he 
(Allada) defeated the Sultan of Dhara in battle and caused his horses 
to be plundered. 3 

Taking advantage of Hushang’s absence, Ahmad Shah of 
Gujarat invaded Malwa (A.D. 1422) and besieged Mandu. The 
rains, however, forced Ahmad to retire to Ujjain so that on his re¬ 
turn Hushang was able to slip into his capital. Ahmad reopened 
his siege, but finding that success was not possible, returned to 
Sarangpur. Hushang also marched there, and for a period of about 
two and a half months the two armies faced each other without 
engaging in a general action. The advantage was with the Malwa 
army, and at last Ahmad began his retreat on March 17, 1422, and 
reached Ahmadabad on the following May 15. 

The same year Hushang captured the town of Gagraun 33 whence 
he proceeded to Gwalior and besieged the fort. On receipt of this 
news, Mubarak Shah, the Sayyid king of Delhi, marched on Gwalior 
to relieve its Hindu chieftain, which forced Hushang to raise the 
siege. According to Yahya bin Ahmad, he was worsted in some 
desultory fighting near the Chambal and ultimately extricated 
himself out of a difficult situation by paying a tribute to Mubarak 
Shah. 4 

In 1428, Ahmad Shah BahmanI attacked the Hindu king ©f 
Kherla, 4a who appealed to Hushang for help. Hushang responded 
with alacrity, and Ahmad Shah left Kherla on learning of the ap¬ 
proach of Hushang’s army. But Hushang, at the instance of the 
king of Kherla, pursued the retreating army for three days after 
which period the BahmanI army turned round on him. In the action 
that followed, Hushang suffered a disastrous defeat and barely 
managed to escape. His wife was taken prisoner, but later returned 
to him by Ahmad Shah. 

In 1431, Hushang advanced to conquer Kalpl. But when he 
arrived near the place, news was brought to him that Sultan Ibra¬ 
him Sharql was also coming with large army to conquer Kalpl. Soon 
the two armies faced each other and a battle seemed imminent, 
when Ibrahim Shah retired to Jaunpur on receipt of the news that 
Mubarak Shah was marching on Jaunpur. Hushang thereupon cap¬ 
tured Kalpl without any opposition, and returned to his capital after 
appointing Qadir Khan as governor of the place. 

175 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


On his way he came to learn from his officials that the Hindus 
who lived near the Jatba hill had raveged some towns and villages 
and had taken shelter near the reservoir of Bhlm. From the descrip¬ 
tion left by Nizam-ud-din, it appears that this was the celebrated 
Bhojasagara built by the Paramara Emperor. 5 Hushang broke the 
dam of this huge lake which flooded the whole locality, and this pro¬ 
bably forced the people to surrender to him, though the king of 
Jatba managed to escape. 

Shortly after Hushang died (July 6, 1435) and was succeeded by 
his son Ghazni Khan under the name of Muhammad Shah. Though 
Ghazni had been nominated as the heir-apparent by his father, a 
number of nobles espoused the cause of his younger brother ‘Usman 
Khan and Ghazni owed his throne to the powerful support of Malik 
Mughis, and the latter’s son, Mahmud Khan, into whose hands he 
left the administration. He, however, put to death his three 
brothers and blinded his nephew and son-in-law, Nizam Khan, and 
his three young sons. This barbarity alienated the nobles, and 
Muhammad Shah made matters worse by his slothful habits aggra¬ 
vated by continuous drinking. As a result, Mahmud Khan became 
very powerful and began to scheme for usurping the throne. This 
was disclosed to the Sultan by some of his friends, but he merely 
called Mahmud to his harem, and there, in the presence of his wife, 
Mahmud’s sister, appealed to him to be faithful. Mahmud swore 
fidelity, but shortly afterwards contrived to murder the Sultan by 
putting poison in his wine. 

A faction of the nobles now raised the late king’s son Mas‘ud 
Khan, a boy of thirteen, to the throne, but Mahmud easily overcame 
them, and Mas‘ud with his brother fled to Gujarat . Mahmud then 
offered the throne to his father, Malik Mughis, but as he declined 
the honour, Mahmud proclaimed himself king on May 16, 1436. 6 
Thus the royal line of the Ghurls was replaced by that of the 
Khaljis. 

II. THE KHALJI DYNASTY 
1. MAHMUD SHAH (1436-69) 

Some time after Mahmud’s accession, an attempt was made on 
his life by some nobles instigated by Ahmad Khan, a son of Hushang. 
Mahmud pardoned the offenders and, on the advice of his father, 
granted them suitable fiefs. But they rebelled again, when Ahmad 
Khan was poisoned and other rebels defeated and punished. In the 
meantime Sultan Ahmad of Gujarat invaded Malwa in order to 
restore to its throne the fugitive Mas‘ud. The campaign at first 
opened favourably for Sultan Ahmad, but gradually Mahmud, aided 


176 


MALWA 


by his father, gained some success. Ultimately a pestilence broke 
out in the Gujarat army, and Sultan Ahmad retired to his king¬ 
dom. 

Mahmud then turned to Chanderi where a rebel amir was hold¬ 
ing out. After a siege of eight months Chanderi was reduced, when 
news came that Dungar Sen, the chieftain of Gwalior, had besieged 
the city of Narwar. 7 Mahmud retaliated by invading and ravaging 
the territory of Gwalior and besieging that fortress. Dungar Sen 
was therefore, obliged to raise the siege of Narwar and return to his 
territory, while Mahmud, his task accomplished, returned to Malwa. 

In 1440, Mahmud was invited by several nobles of Delhi to come 
and supplant the weak Sayyid king Muhammad Shah, and he 
advanced towards Delhi with a large army. His precipitate retreat, 
after an indecisive engagement, has been mentioned above. 73 Seve¬ 
ral reasons have been advanced for this pusillanimous conduct of 
Mahmud, but as Nizam-ud-dln and Firishta say, the retreat was 
most probably due to a rumour that Ahmad, the king of Gujarat, 
was about to invade Malwa. 

Shortly after this expedition, Mahmud led an army against 
Chitor to chastise Maharana Kumbha for the support which he had 
extended to ‘Umar Khan, the son of Muhammad Shah Ghurl. Now, 
in the Ranapura temple inscription of Maharana Kumbha, dated 
V.S. 1496 (A.D. 1440), it is claimed that he defeated the Mlechchha 
kings, and conquered, amongst others, the fort of S-arangapura, and 
that “his title as the Hindu Sultan was made known by the umbrella 
of royalty given (him) by the Sultan (s) protecting Gurjara and the 
territory of Dhilli”. 8 The Muslim historians state that after ad¬ 
vancing into Chitor and defeating the Maharna’s troops in several 
engagements, Mahmud sent an army under his father to reduce the 
territory in possession of the Rajputs near Mandasor which 
(Mandora), according to the inscription cited above, along with 
Sarangapura, Nagapura (Nagaur), Gagaranara (Gagraun) etc. were 
conquered by the Maharana. It seems probable, therefore, that 
Kumbha, after entering into friendly relations with the Sultans of 
Delhi and Gujarat, invaded Malwa and advanced up to Mandasor, 
possibly taking advantage of Mahmud’s absence in his Delhi expe¬ 
dition. On his return, Mahmud adopted the same tactics that he 
had used against Dungar Sen, namely, advancing into the aggressor’s 
territory to force him to retire from Malwa. From the account left 
by the Muslim historians it appears that Mahmud broke and dese¬ 
crated Hindu temples, and erected mosques in their places. He also 
took more heinous measures to outrage their sentiment. 9 It is, how- 

177 

D.S.—12 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ever, apparent that Mahmud was obliged to return to Malwa with¬ 
out gaining any success. 

While Mahmud was busy with the expedition against Maharana 
Kumbha, Sultan Mahmud Sharqi of Jaunpur invaded Kalpl. The 
causes of this invasion and its results have been narrated in connec¬ 
tion with the history of Jaunpur. 

Shortly afterwards (A.D. 1444), Mahmud again invaded the 
Maharana’s dominion, this time with the object of capturing the fort 
of Mandalgarh. He was again unsuccessful and, after fighting an 
indecisive battle, had to retire. 

In 1450, Gaiigadas, the Raja of Champaner, sought Mahmud’s 
help, in exchange of a monetary present, against Sultan Muhammad 
of Gujarat who was besieging Champaner. Mahmud came to Gah- 
gadas’s help, but had to retire without gaining success. Next year 
he again invaded Gujarat and, after reaching Broach, was marching 
towards the capital, when he suffered a crushing defeat and had 
to fall back, leaving his baggage and eighty-one elephants behind 
him. Later, he sent his son Ghiyas-ud-dln to raid Surat. 

Three years later (A.D. 1453), Mahmud again resolved to con¬ 
quer Rajputana. Before setting on the expedition, however, he 
entered into a treaty with Sultan Qutb-ud-dln of Gujarat. It was 
settled that the Gujarat army should plunder and ravage such part 
of Kumbha’s dominions as were contiguous to Gujarat, and Mahmud 
Shah should take possession of the country of Mewar and Ajmer 
and all the neighbouring countries; and whenever necessary, either 
of the parties should not refuse to aid and help the other. 10 

Mahmud first invaded Haravatl, modern Bundl, which at this 
time was a part of Kumbha’s kingdom. 11 After subjugating Hara¬ 
vati, Mahmud was incited to attack the BahmanI king by some dis¬ 
gruntled DeccanI nobles, but as he laid siege to the fort of Mahur, 
he found himself opposed by a superior army and beat a hasty re¬ 
treat. 

Soon after his return from the Deccan campaign Mahmud was 
approached by his vassal Raja of Baglana for help against Mubarak 
of Khandesh, who had invaded Baglana. Mahmud sent an army to 
help the Raja, and Mubarak fled away after suffering a heavy defeat. 
Mubarak attacked Baglana again next year, but again a Malwa 
army came to the rescue of the Raja, and Mubarak went back to 
his country without risking a battle. 

After this Mahmud advanced against Chitor. According to the 
Muslim historians, Maharana Kumbha ‘attempted to propitiate 
him by an indemnity, but as the coins bore the effigy of the Maha- 


178 


MALWA 


rana, Mahmud refused to accept it, set about to ravage the country, 
and sent an army to waste the district of Mandasor. The course 
of this campaign is described in great detail by the Muslim histo¬ 
rians, but it is apparent from their accounts that Mahmud failed 
to conquer any part of the Maharana’s territory except Ajmer. As 
noted elsewhere, (p. 162) a verse from the Chitor KIrtistambha in¬ 
scription claims that Maharana Kumbha defeated the kings of Gujarat 
and Malwa. On this Sir Wolseley Haig remarks: “The more famous 
column of victory at Chitor is said to commemorate victories over 
Mahmud of Gujarat and Mahmud of Malwa. If this is so it, ‘like 
some tall bully lifts its head and lies’.” 12 It is therefore necessary 
to quote Nizam-ud-dm’s version of the battle that took place as 
Mahmud, after conquering Ajmer, turned towards Mandalgarh: 
“Konbha also sent out his army from the fort dividing it into three 
detachments. The division, which confronted Taj Khan, and that 
which was opposed to ‘All Khan, fought with arrows and lances and 
there was a great battle; and a large number of Mahmud Shah’s 
troops were slain, while an innumerable host of Rajputs became 

food for the sword. (At sunset) the two parties took up their 

quarters in their respective stations. In the morning the amirs and 
vazirs collected in the royal pavilion, and submitted that as during 
that year the troops had been fighting repeated campaigns and the 
rainy season was near, it would be fitting and proper, if he would 
rest and repose for a few days in the capital city of Shadlabad, in 
order to repair the damage and injury to the army; and make after 
the rains, with a fully equipped army, a king-like attempt to cap¬ 
ture the fort. Sultan Mahmud returned and rested for some days.”. 1 ? 

This undoubtedly shows that Mahmud was worsted in the fight 
and was glad to retire on any pretext, and this was probably the 
occasion, as Col. Briggs pointed out, of the erection of the KIrtis¬ 
tambha. Mahmud again invaded Maharana Kumbha’s territory, in 
1456 and 1458, but though he was able to break a number of temples, 
he failed to gain any success. 

In September 1461 Mahmud invaded the BahmanI kingdom at 
the instigation of Malik Nizam-ul-mulk Ghuri. 14 On his way he made 
an attempt to conquer the fort of Asir but ultimately finding the 
task to be impossible, accepted the token submission of ‘Adil Khan of 
Khandesh. He then proceeded further and was soon confronted by the 
BahmanI army under the nominal command of the boy king Nizam 
Shah. In the battle that followed, the BahmanI army broke through 
the left wing of Mahmud’s army and started to plunder the Malwa 
camp. Suddenly Mahmud, who was waiting with twelve thousand 
horsemen for such an opportunity, attacked the BahmanI soldiers 


179 


THE DEIHI SULTANATE 


from their rear, and completely defeated them. The boy king Nizam 
Shah was removed in haste to join his mother Malika-i-Jahan at 
Bidar, from where they shifted to Flruzabad, while Mahmud be¬ 
sieged the former city. In this predicament Malika-i-Jahan appeal- 
led to Mahmud Begarha of Gujarat for help. Mahmud Begarha soon 
arrived with an army of 80,000 horse, and Mahmud Gavan, the 
famous Bahmani minister, marched out by way of Bir and received 
reinforcement from Mahmud Begarha. Mahmud (of Malwa) found 
his line of retreat entirely cut off and was forced to flee through 
eastern Berar, followed by Mahmud Gavan. Soon Mahmud’s flight 
became a rout and abandoning all his heavy baggage and elephants, 
which he blinded, he entered the Gond territory where many of his 
soldiers died of thirst and many were killed by marauders. 

A year after this disastrous defeat, Mahmud again set out to 
invade the Bahmani kingdom, which was during this period repeated¬ 
ly attacked by the king of Orissa. Mahmud seems to have entered 
into an alliance with the latter, for on his way to the Deccan he 
received 530 elephants from the Orissa king. As he had lost his 
elephants in the previous campaign, this present must have been 
very welcome to him. He also received at this time from Mustanjad 
Billah Yusuf, the Caliph, a robe of honour and a mandate conferring 
on him imperial dignity. The Caliphs during this period were 
nonentities, still the Muslim potentates of India attached great value 
to these recognitions. 

When Mahmud reached near Daulatabad, he heard that Mahmud 
Begarha was advancing against him. Mahmud therefore returned 
to Malwa after ravaging a few places on his way. 

Four years later (A.D. 1466) Mahmud sent a marauding expedi¬ 
tion under an officer to ravage Ellichpur. This expedition was 
successful and next year the Bahmani king concluded a treaty of 
peace, ceding Berar, as far as Ellichpur to Malwa while, Mahmud 
on his part promised to respect the new frontier. The disputed 
territory of Kherla (Mahmudabad) was left to Malwa. 15 Later, 
the governor of Kherla and the local Hindu chief rebelled but were 
crushed by Mahmud. Another rebellion broke out in A.D. 1468-9 
(A.H. 873) in Kachwarah (Khajuraho?), but was put down, after 
which Mahmud built a fortress in the country. 

Later in the same year (A.H. 873) Buhlul Lodi sent Shaikhzada 
Muhammad Farmali and Kapur Chand, the son of the Raja of 
Gwalior, as ambassadors to Mahmud. 16 Soon after, Mahmud started 
from Fathabad, where he had received the Delhi embassy, for his 
capital. He died on the way in May, 1469. 17 


180 


MALWA 


Mahmud was the most powerful Sultan of Malwa, and though 
many of his campaigns ended in failure, he was able to increase 
his kingdom, which reached its greatest extent during his reign. 
In spite, however, of his almost continuous campaigns, he seems to 
have left behind a stable government which withstood even the 
vagaries of his successor. He was a great builder and erected a 
column to commemorate his victory over Maharana Kumbha. 
Mahmud was a pious Musulman, and introduced the lunar calendar 
in Malwa. But he was a bigot and not only loved to destroy the 
images and temples of the Hindus, but also outraged their religious 
sentiments in all possible ways. 

2. GHlYAS-UD-DiN (A.D . 1469-1500) 

Mahmud was succeeded by his eldest son Ghiyas-ud-din, who 
on his accession declared it to be his firm policy to remain at peace 
with his neighbours and enjoy the pleasures of life. So faithfully 
did he adhere to this policy that when Buhlul Lodi raided Palam- 
pur, he was with great difficulty recalled to a sense of duty by his 
ministers, and even then sent an army under some officers instead 
of taking the field himself. He was a bigot like his father, but in 
some respects even surpassed him. Champaner, attacked by Mahmud 
Begarha, turned to Malwa for help, but he refused on the ground 
that it was unlawful for a Musulman to help an infidel against 
Musulmans. Thus he changed the traditional policy of the Sultans 
of Malwa and allowed the strong fort of Champaner to be annexed 
to Gujariat. 

In spite, however, of his declared policy of peace there are 
reasons to believe that he attacked Chitor twice and was twice 
defeated, as has been related in connection with the history of 
Mewar. 18 

Ghiyas-ud-din, at the beginning of his reign, entrusted the 
management of the State to his son Nasir-ud-dln, and devoted all his 
time to the management of his harem, where he had collected 
more than 16,000 women. He was however of a deeply religious 
temperament, and, being gullible, fell a prey to tricksters. A man, 
who brought him the hoof of an ass and claimed that Jesus 
Christ rode the same animal when he entered Jerusalem, received 
50,000 tankas for the hoof. Three other persons sold for the 
same amount three more hoofs of a similar kind with the same 
story. Then a fifth man came to him with another hoof and the 
same story, and the Sultan paid him 50,000 tankas for it. There¬ 
upon one of the royal attendants remarked that perhaps the ass of 
Jesus had five legs, to which the Sultan replied that perhaps the 


181 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


last vendor of the hoof was telling the truth, while one of the 
others may have been wrong. 

As may be expected, the last days of Ghiyas-ud-din was em¬ 
bittered by a struggle for the throne between his two sons, Nasir- 
ud-din and ‘Ala-ud-din, in which his favourite queen Khurshld 
espoused the cause of the latter. Nasir-ud-din, however, emerged 
victorious, and ascended the throne on October 22, 1500. ‘Ala-ud-din 
was executed and Khurshld committed to prison, but Ghiyas-ud- 
din, then sinking to his grave, was left unmolested. Soon after 
Ghiyas-ud-din died (February 28, 1501) which gave rise to a 
rumour that he had been poisoned by his son. 

3. NASIR-UD-DIN (A.D . 1500-1511) 

The beginning of Nasir’s reign was troubled by the rebellion 
of some of his nobles, who refused to acknowledge him as king. 
Nasir, however, was able to suppress the rebellions and, in A.D. 1503, 
headed a marauding expedition against Chitor. According to the 
Muslim historians he was bought off by Maharana Raimal, but 
according to the Rajput chronicles, the Malwa army, which came 
to aid two Rajput traitors, suffered a disastrous defeat. 

Naslr-ud-din was a cruel man by nature, and this trait was 
aggravated by his intemperate habits. This disgusted his nobles, 
some of whom instigated his son Shihab-ud-din to rebel. Naslr- 
ud-din, however, crushed the rebel forces and Shihab-ud-din fled to 
Chanderi. Though Nasir-ud-din forebore from taking extreme 
steps against his son who disregarded his call to sumbit to him, he 
nominated his younger son, A‘zam Humayun, as his heir, and bestow¬ 
ed on him the title of Mahmud Shah. A few days later Nasir-ud-din 
died and immediately Mahmud Shah II ascended the throne (May, 
2, 1511). On hearing of his father’s death, Shihab-ud-din made a 
bid for the throne, but was defeated and took shelter in the fortress 
of Aslr. 

4. MAHMUD SHAH II (A.D. 1511-1531) 

The main interest in the history of Malwa during the reign of 
Mahmud II, is the clash between the Hindu and the Muslim nobles. 
As we shall see, the Hindus had become very powerful in Malwa, and 
Mahmud ultimately lost his throne by antagonizing them. 

It appears that the Hindus had been occupying high offices, at 
least in the revenue department, since the reign of Ghiyas-ud-din. 
During the reign of Nasir-ud-din one Basanta Rai became the 
WCtzir, and was confirmed in his post by Mahmud. According to 

182 


MALWA 


Firishta, the Muslim amirs became hostile to him lest he should 
become too powerful, while Nizam-ud-din relates that he failed to 
maintain cordial relations with the army, and by his bad manner and 
haughty temperament alienated the amirs and the sardars. There¬ 
fore they one day murdered Basanta Rai and the Naqd-ul-Mulk* 
who also was a Hindu, fled into the Sultan’s harem for protection. 
The amirs then wrote to Mahmud justifying their conduct and de¬ 
manded that the Naqd-ul-Mulk be surrenderd to them. Mahmud 
acceded to this request, and the amirs expelled the Naqd-ul-Mulk. 

Mahmud then placed the government in the hands of Iqbal 
Khan and Mukhtass Khan, who were the leaders of the conspiracy 
to murder Basanta Rai. Soon, however, another noble, named 
Muhafiz Khan, poisoned the Sultan’s mind against Iqbal Khan and 
Mukhtass Khan, and matters came to such a pass that they fled and 
sent for Shihab-ud-din. He eagerly started from Aslr to contest 
the throne once more, but died on the way (July 29, 1511). 

Iqbal Khan and Mukhtass Khan then sent the body of Shihab- 
ud-din to Mahmud for burial, and raised the former’s son (or adopted 
son) as a pretender under the title of Hushang Shah. 

Mahmud performed dutifully the last rites of his brother, but 
sent an army against Hushang which forced him to flee. In the 
meantime, Muhafiz Khan, whom Mahmud had appointed wazir, had 
grown too powerful, and the rebels Iqbal Khan and Mukhtass Khan 
appealed to Mahmud repenting for their past misdeeds and com¬ 
plaining against Muhafiz Khan. One day Muhafiz insolently pro¬ 
posed that Mahmud’s eldest brother Sahib Khan should be put to 
death, and Mahmud, in anger, struck the wazir with the scabbard of 
his sword. The latter, making good his escape, raised a force and, 
releasing Sahib Khan from his prison, proclaimed him king. Show¬ 
ing great personal bravery Mahmud escaped from his capital to 
Ujjain to find that most of his nobles had deserted him. He, there¬ 
fore, turned for help to a Hindu officer, Medinl Rai, who was ap¬ 
parently a man of outstanding ability with a large following. In 
the battle that ultimately took place, Medinl Rai and his Riajputs 
routed Sahib Khan’s army and the latter escaped first to Gujarat, and 
then to Kawil, in the Deccan. . ; ■ 

Medini Rai now became the most powerful man in Malwa and 
induced the king to execute Afzal Khan and Iqbal Khan. This led 
some Muslim officers to rebel, and recalling Sahib Khan to contest 
the throne once more, they appealed to Sikandar Lodi for help 
against a Sultan who had placed the government in the hands of 
the Hindus. Sikandar Lodi sent a contingent to help the rebellion, 
which at one time showed good prospects of success.- The situation 


183 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


for Mahmud was worsened by an invasion of Mialwa by Muzaffar II 
of Gujarat, who was, however recalled to his own country by domes¬ 
tic disturbances. The details of these difficult times are given both 
by Nizam-ud-din and Firishta from which it becomes apparent that 
it was the steadfast support which Mahmud received from Medini 
Rai and his Hindu followers that enabled him to retain his throne 
and eventually recover his kingdom. 

Later, however, at the instance of Medini Rai he punished many 
nobles, and as Nizam-ud-dm puts it, “gradually things came to such 
a pass, that the disposition of Mahmud Shah turned from all the 
cimirs, and in fact from all Musalmans.” This alienated the Muslims 
from Mahmud, and the Muslim nobles began to leave Malwa. Medini 
Rai on his part filled most of the offices with his nominees, who 
were all Hindus, and some of them adopted Muslim mistresses, which 
gave the Muslims great offence. 

Mahmud felt restive under the power of Medini Rai, and one 
day politely dismissed him. Medini Rai’s followers first sent a mes¬ 
sage to the Sultan asking what fault they had committed. They 
then met and proposed that Medini Rai’s son should be raised to the 
throne of Malwa. To this Medini Rai objected and said: “At the 
present moment, the Sultanate of Malwa is in reality in our posses¬ 
sion. If, however, Mahmud Shah does not remain as a buffer, Sultan 
Muzaffar Gujarati will come galloping along and seize the kingdom. 
Therefore, we should, in every way that may be possible, endeavour 
to please our master”. 

Medini Rai went to the Sultan, and begged to be forgiven, and 
the Sultan directed that the former should reinstate the Muslim 
officials, forbid his men to interfere in state affairs, and ask them 
to return the Musulman women. Medini Rai agreed to all the condi¬ 
tions, but Salivahana, the wazir refused to obey the orders of the 
Sultan in respect of his mistress. Mahmud, therefore, conspired 
with his personal attendants, who were all Muslims, and the next 
day as Medini Rai and Salivahana stepped out of the palace they 
were attacked by the royal guards. Salivahana was killed on the 
spot, but Medini Rai, though wounded, managed to reach home. The 
infuriated followers of Medini Rai now attacked the Sultan who re¬ 
sisted them with great bravery and repulsed them. 

As soon as Medini Rai came to learn of this he stopped his fol¬ 
lowers, and sent dutiful submission to the king, to which the latter 
also sent a gracious reply. So when Medini Rai’s wounds healed 
up, he began to attend the court regularly as before and pay his 
respects to the Sultan daily. But it appears that Mahmud had not 
been able to check the hegemony of the Hindus, and finding his posi- 


184 


MALWA 


tion unbearable, he one day escaped to Gujarat, accompanied by his 
favourite queen and a single servant (A.D. 1517). 

Mahmud was cordially received by Muzaffar and soon a Gujarat 
army, led by the two kings, invaded Malwa and besieged Mandu. 
Medini Rai and his broher, Silhadi, went to Maharana Sainga to gain 
his help, leaving the affairs of Malwa in the hands of Medini Rai’s 
son, Rai Pithora, that is Prithviraja. Prithviraja defended the fort 
of Mandu as long as possible, but ultimately it fell to the invaders 
before Maharana Sanga could arrive, and a large number of Hindus 
were massacred. Muzaffar then restored Mahmud to his throne and 
returned to Gujarat, leaving a contingent of Gujarat cavalry to help 
Mahmud. 

Though Mahmud had thus recovered his capital, most of the 
strong points and forts such as Chanderi, Kawun, Bhllsa, Raisen and 
Sarangpur were in the hands of Medini Rai’s followers. Mahmud 
therefore besieged the fort of Gagraun which was held by one Hema- 
karana, on behalf of Medini Rai. 

While this siege was in progress, Medini Rai advanced into 
Malwa with the army led by Maharaha Sanga, and Mahmud, on 
hearing the news, hastily raised the siege and advanced towards the 
Rajput army. As Mahmud’s army was resting after a day’s march, 
the Maharana, without giving his troops any rest, suddenly attacked 
and routed the Malwa army. Mahmud fell wounded and was taken 
a prisoner. 

According to Rajput chronicles, Mahmud was taken to Chitor, 
and was kept in honourable captivity for a period of several months. 
Nizam-ud-din and Firishta, however, relate that Mahmud was re¬ 
leased after he regained his health, and then the Maharana returned 
to Chitor. But all the historians have praised highly this generous 
conduct of the great Maharana. Nizam-ud-din says: “No act similar 
to this wonderful one is known up to the present day.” 

Maharana Sanga has been adversely criticized for what has been 
called his misplaced generosity. But it should be remembered that 
he annexed a part of Malwa, and Silhadi, a Hindu chief, became the 
independent ruler of the territory extending from Sarangpur to 
Bhllsa and Raisen. A Muslim noble, called Sikandar Khan, took 
possession of the territory near Satwas. Thus Mahmud was left 
practically powerless with a very small territory. 

However, Mahmud tried to regain his lost position and managed 
to conquer Sarangpur from Silhadi. He sent a marauding expedi¬ 
tion to Chitor, and in retaliation Maharana Ratansimha advanced 
up to Ujjain. Fortunately for Mahmud, Sultan Bahadur of Gujarat 

185 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


had come near the Malwa frontier with his army to put down some 
local disturbance, and he induced the Maharana to return. 

Mahmud offended Bahadur Shah, the successor of Muzaffar II 
of Gujarat, by granting asylum to Bahadur’s rival to the throne, 
Chand Khan, whose agents approached Babur to invade Guja¬ 
rat. Sultan Bahadur therefore determined to chastise Mahmud. 
Alarmed at this invasion Mahmud called Silhadi and Mu‘In Khan, son 
of Sikandar Khan, to his aid, and bestowed several parganas on the 
former and the title of Masnad ‘All and other honours on the latter. 
But they deserted Mahmud and joined Bahadur. 

Mahmud then sent ambassadors to win over Bahadur, who 
wanted Mahmud to come and meet him. This, however, Mahmud 
steadfastly refused to do under various pretexts. Bahadur therefore 
continued his advance and Mahmud shut himself up in the fort of 
Mandu, determined, with a pathetic eagerness, to enjoy the last days 
of his life. ' - ' 

The fort fell to Bahadur on May 25, 1531, 19 and Mahmud was in¬ 
duced by his nobles to submit to Bahadur. Bahadur received him 
affably, but took serious offence at the harsh language used by 
Mahmud. Three days later, on a Friday, public prayers in Mandu 
were read in Bahadur’s name and next day Mahmud and his sons 
were put in chains and sent under an escort to be confined in Champa- 
ner. On the way the escort was attacked one night by some Bhils 
and Kolis, and Mahmud, roused by the tumult, broke his chains, but 
was overpowered by his guards who killed him lest he should 
escape. 

Bahadur’s main act after annexing Malwa was to crush Silhadi, 
who had refused to part away with his Muslim mistress. Silhadi’s 
fort, Raisen, fell after a gallant fight, and his son and followers took 
shelter at Chitor. Bahadur then appointed Muslim nobles to various 
offices and returned to Gujarat. For the duration of Bahadur’s reign 
Malwa remained a province of Gujarat. 

D. JAUNPUR 

The modern city of Jaunpur on the river Gumti, thirty-four miles 
north-west of Banaras, was founded by Firuz Shah and remained 
the headquarters of the provincial government till 1394. According 
to Shams-i-Siraj ‘AfIf, the contemporary historian, Firuz Shah halt¬ 
ed at Zafarabad in 1359 on his way to Bengal and impressed by the 
site of the present city where the road crossed the river, decided 
to build a town there to be called Jaunpur, after the name of his 
cousin Sultan Muhmmad whose real name was Jauna. 1 


186 


JAUNPUR 


Cunningham was of the opinion that there was an older Hindu 
city called Jamanpur on the Gumti, and Flruz Shah utilized the 
materials from the buildings of this older town to lay the foundation 
of his new city. The Hindus of Jaunpur still call their city 
‘Jamanpur’, and believe that the name is derived from the Sage 
Jamadagni. 

The founder of the Sultanate of Jaunpur was Malik Sarvar who 
is said to have begun his career as a slave of Sultan Muhammad 
(son of Flruz Tughluq). But he rose steadily till he became the 
wazir in A.D. 1389 with the title of Khvaja Jahan. Sultan Mahmud, 
the last Tughluq king, conferred on him the title of Malik-ush-Sharq 
(chief of the east) and appointed him governor of the eastern pro¬ 
vinces of the empire. 

The object in appointing the wazir as a governor was to sup¬ 
press the Hindu rebellions which had thrown the government of 
this part of the country into confusion. Malik Sarvar left Delhi for 
Jaunpur in A.D. 1394 and suppressed the rebels at Etawa, Koll 
and Kanauj. He then recovered from the rebels Awadh, Kanauj, 
Sandila, Dalmau, Bahraich, and Bihar, and repaired the forts which 
they had destroyed. Thus he consolidated his position, establishing 
his hold over a vast territory comprising Awadh, and the Gangetic 
valley from Koll in the west to Bihar in the east. The ruler of 
Bengal is said to have sent him tributes, which had been withheld 
from the weak government of Delhi. 

Malik Sarvar was for all practical purposes an independent 
king, though he abstained from assuming the parapharnelia of 
sovereignty. During the invasion of Timur he did not send any help 
to Delhi. He died in A.D. 1399 in the plentitude of his power, leaving 
behind a kingdom which stretched from Koil in the west to Tirhut 
and Bihar in the east. 

Malik Sarvar, a eunuch, probably of Negro blood, was succeed¬ 
ed by his adopted son who assumed the title of Sultan Mubarak 
Shah. His original name Qaranful (clove) seems to indicate that 
he was an African slave. Mubarak issued coins and had the khutba 
read in his name. This provoked an attack on Jaunpur by Mallu 
Iqbal Khan, the powerful minister of Sultan Mahmud Tughluq 
(A.D. 1400). The two armies encamped on the two banks of the 
Ganga, but after a period of inactivity, the scarcity of provisions 
forced them to come to an understanding and the two armies re¬ 
turned to their respective capitals. Shortly after, Mubarak Shah 
died (A.D. 1402), and the amirs raised his brother Ibrahim to the 
throne, under the title of Shams-ud-dln Ibrahim. 


187 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Soon after his accession Ibrahim Shah was faced with an inva¬ 
sion by Mallu Iqbal and Mahmud Tughluq. The two belligerents 
stood confronting each other on the opposite banks of the Ganga. 
Then, as has been related above, 2 Sultan Mahmud, unable to bear 
the tutelage of Iqbal, escaped to Ibrahim Shah’s camp, and being 
coldly received there, fled to Kanauj which he occupied. Iqbal left 
for Delhi without fighting with Ibrahim Shiah, who returned to 
Jaunpur. 

However, when after the death of Iqbal, Sultan Mahmud re¬ 
turned to Delhi (A.D. 1405), Ibrahim Shah, after an initial failure 
re-annexed Kanauj after a siege of four months (A.D. 1407). He 
was then joined by several other nobles and made a bid for the con¬ 
quest of Delhi. Capturing Sambhal on his way, Ibrahim arrived 
near Delhi when news reached him that Sultan Muzaffar Shah of 
Gujarat was sending an army to relieve Sultan Mahmud. Ibrahim 
thereupon returned to Jaunpur and spent the next fourteen years 
there patronizing art and literature. During this period, he once 
resolved to invade Bengal from where complaints of the persecution 
of the Muslims by the Hindu Raja Ganesa reached him. According 
to some accounts Ganesa had his son converted to Islam and Ibrahim 
was pacified, while according to other accounts Ibrahim was 
defeated. 3 

In A.D. 1427, Ibrahim attacked Bayana in an attempt to restore 
it to Muhammad Khan Auladl. He was opposed by Mubarak Shah, 
the Sayyid king of Delhi, but after an indecisive battle the two 
armies retired in good order (A.D. 1428). In A.D. 1431, Ibrahim 
attempted to conquer KalpI but was opposed by Sultan Hushang 
Ghurl of Malwa who also had the same objective. 4 Before any action 
took place, news came that Mubarak Shah, the Sayyid king of Delhi, 
was advancing towards Jaunpur. Thereupon Ibrahim returned, and 
KalpI fell into the hands of Hushang Ghurl. Nine years later Ibra¬ 
him died (A.D. 1440). 6 

During Ibrahim Shah’s long reign of about forty years Jaunpur 
attained to the height of fame and prosperity. It also became a 
notable centre of learning, and books like the the Hashiah-i-Hindt, the 
Eahr-ul-Mawwdj, the Fatwa-i-Ibrcihim Shahl, and the Irshad were 
written by renowned scholars including Qazi Shihab-ud-din, the 
great favourite of Sultan Ibrahim. His reign was also memorable 
for the architectural splendour of Jaunpur to which reference will 
be made later. 

Ibrahim Shah was succeeded by his eldest son Mahmud Shah. 
It is related that Mahmud Shah set about invading Bengal where- 


188 


JAUNPUR 


upon the king of Bengal appealed to Shah Rukh the king of Iran, 
through the Raja of Sialkot. Shah Rukh ordered Mahmud Shah to 
desist. Mahmud Shah obeyed the order of Shah Rukh, and instead 
of proceeding towards Bengal advanced towards Kalpi. 

Sultan Hushang of Malwa who, as noted above, had captured 
the district of Kalpi, appointed one Qadir Khan as its governor. 
After Hushang’s death. Qadir became more or less independent of 
Malwa. He was succeeded by his son Nasir, and Sultan Mahmud 
complained about Nasir’s outrageous conduct to Sultan Mahmud 
Khalji of Malwa. The charge against Nasir was “that he had 
destroyed the town of Shahpur which was larger and more populous 
than K!alpl, had banished Musalmans from their homes and had 
made over Musalman women to Kafirs ’\ The basis for the last charge 
seems to be that the Muslim girls were handed over to the Hindus 
in order that they might be taught dancing. Nasir probably adopted 
harsh measures against the Muslims of Shahpur as a punishment 
for some misdeeds, such as rebellion. The charges, however, 
were so grave, that Sultan Mahmud Khalji, who was then occupied 
elsewhere, gave Sultan Mahmud permission to chastise Nasir, and the 
Sultan of Jaunpur thereupon invaded Kalpi. Later, however, Nasir 
obtained the protection of Mahmud Khalji, who proposed to the 
Sultan of Jaunpur that as Nasir had expressed his contrition he 
should be left in possession of Rath in the Kalpi district. As Mahmud 
of Jaunpur rejected this proposal, Mahmud Khalji marched against 
him (November, 1444) and fought an indecisive action near Irij. 
Eventually, through the mediation of a Muslim saint, peace was 
restored between Janupur and Malwa by the immediate cession 
of Rath or Rohut to Nasir and a promise to restore Kalpi after four 
months within which period Mahmud Khalji was to retire to Mandu. 
By the end of the year the two Mahmuds returned to their respec¬ 
tive capitals and Kalpi was restored to Nasir. 

After this Mahmud suppressed a rebellion in Chunar and is 
said to have led a successful raid into Orissa. 6 In 1452, he advanced 
against Delhi, in response to an invitation by some recalcitrant 
nobles, to remove Buhlul Lodi, the Afghan, from the throne. The 
course of this war in which the Jaunpur army suffered defeat has 
already been narrated. 7 Hostilities with Delhi again broke out when 
Buhlul Lodi forced the Raja of Etawa to submission. As Mahmud 
claimed the allegiance of Etawa, he invaded the district to contest 
BuhluTs claim. After some desultory fighting, however, they came 
to terms, and a peace was concluded according to which the boundary 
between the two states was to remain as it had been during the 
reign of Mubarak Shah, and Buhlul was to be permitted to conquer 


189 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Shamsabad from its governor who owed nominal allegiance to 
Jaunpur. 

But after Buhlul conquered Shamsabad and conferred it upon 
one Raja Karan, Mahmud marched against Buhlul. As the Jaunpur 
army approached Shamsabad, it was attacked by an advance guard 
of Buhlul under Qutb Khan Lodi. The attack failed and Qutb 
Khan was taken prisoner and sent to Jaunpur. But before any deci¬ 
sive action could take place, Mahmud died in A.D. 1457 and was 
succeeded by his son Bhlkan, who assumed the title of Muham¬ 
mad Shah. 

Muhammad Shah acknowledged Buhlul’s right to retain Sham¬ 
sabad and peace was restored. But as Buhlul was returning to 
Delhi he was reproached by his wife for leaving Qutb Khan, her 
brother, a prisoner of Jaunpur. Buhlul thereupon turned back, and 
Muhammad also marched on Shamsabad, expelled Buhlul’s nominee 
Raja Karan, and restored the fief to its former Sharqi governor. His 
success attracted to his standard some powerful adherents, and 
Muhammad reached the river Saraswatl where some desultory fight¬ 
ing took place. But before any decisive action took place, dissen¬ 
sions broke out in the Jaunpur camp. 

Muhmmad Shah was apprehensive lest one of his four 
brothers—Hasan, Husain, Jalal and Ibrahim—should be raised to 
the throne by the nobles. The prisoner Qutb Khan Lodi was also a 
source of danger, as his sister was prompting her husband Buhlul 
Lodi to attack Jaunpur and rescue her brother. Muhammad Shah 
therefore sent an order to one of his officers at Jaunpur to execute 
his brother Hasan and Qutb Khan Lodi. This order could not be 
carried out as Muhammad’s mother was keeping a strict watch on 
her son and Qutb Khan Lodi. 

Muhammad, therefore, requested his mother to join him in his 
camp on a specious plea and as soon as the dowager Queen left 
Jaunpur, Prince Hasan was executed. On hearing this, Muhammad’s 
two other brothers, Husain Khan and Jalal Khan, who were in the 
camp, decided to revolt. Husain, seceding from the main army with 
30,000 cavalry and 1,000 elephants, joined his mother at Kanauj, 
and was there proclaimed king under the title of Husain Shah. 

There were further defections in Muhammad’s army which 
forced him to retire, pursued by Buhlul up to Kanauj. From Kanauj 
Buhlul returned to Delhi, and Muhammad now found himself oppos¬ 
ed by his brother Husain’s army. Most of his officers deserted him 
and he was killed in the action that followed. 


190 


JAUNPUR 


A four years’ truce was concluded in A.D. 1458 between Buhlul 
and Husain, and Qutb was freed from captivity in exchange of 
Husain’s brother, Jalal Khan, who had been taken prisoner by Buh- 
lul’s soliders in a skirmish shortly after Husain’s departure. 

Husain then collected a large army and proceeded towards 
Orissa by way of Tirhut. He overran Tirhut and it is stated by the 
Muslim historians that the Rai of Orissa, frightened at his approach, 
hastened to secure peace by presenting thirty elephants and one 
hundred horses, besides other valuable materials. Husain accepted 
the presents and returned to Jaunpur. 

The king of Orissa during this raid was either Kapilendra 
(A.D. 1435-1467) or his son Purushottama (A.D. 1467-1497) Kapi¬ 
lendra was a very powerful king and it seems unlikely tha Husain 
could induce him to submit. But the early part of Purushottama’s 
reign was troubled, as has been related elsewhere, and it is not un¬ 
likely that he should have purchased peace by surrendering some 
of his elephants and horses. 8 

Husain then repaired the fort of Banaras and in the following 
year sent an army to besiege the fort of Gwalior. He failed to cap¬ 
ture the fort and had to return satisfied with a tribute. 

According to the Muslim chronicles, Jaunpur at this time pos¬ 
sessed probably the biggest army in India; in any case it was far 

m 

superior, at least in number, to the army of Buhlul Lodi. The four 
years’ truce with Delhi, concluded in A.D. 1458, had long ago ex¬ 
pired, and Husain was constantly urged by his wife Malika-i-Jahan, 
daughter of ‘Alam Shah, the last Sayyid King of Delhi; to conquer 
it from Buhlul. Husain therefore began to make preparations for 
the invasion of Delhi. 

When Buhlul realized that he might not be able to withstand 
a powerful Sharql attack led by Husain, he turned for help to 
Mahmud Khaljl of Malwa and sent him two successive deputations 
in 1469. MushtaqI, Nizam-ud-dln, Firishta and some other writers 
refer only to one deputation, but the contemporary biographer of 
the Sultan of Malwa has given a detailed account of two separate 
missions sent by Buhlul. The first, consisting of Shaikhzada 
Muhammad Farmali and Raizada Kapur Chand, son of Rai Kirat 
Singh of Gwalior, waited on Mahmud on February 21, 1469, and 
solicited his help against Husain’s aggression. Mahmud was willing 
to accede to their request but he expected a price for this help. In 
the meantime, Buhlul appears to have received alarming reports of 
Husain’s designs as he soon after sent another deputation which in¬ 
cluded Qutb Khan Lodi and Rai Kirat Singh which met Mahmud 


191 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


on April 3, 1469. They were authorized to offer the cession of 
Bayana and a yearly levy of 6,000 men if Mahmud came personally 
with his armies to help Buhlul. The Khalji Sultan accepted the 
arrangement but he could not act up to it as he died only a month 
later on May 3, 1469. 9 

The Jaunpur army made triumphant progress and reached the 
suburbs of Delhi. Buhlul, despairing of success, offered terms 
agreeing to cede the whole of his territory, retaining for himself 
only the city of Delhi and the tract of the country lying thirty-six 
miles around it, which he would govern as Husain’s vassal. But 
Husain rejected the terms and Buhlul left the city with a small army 
and encamped on the banks of the Yamuna opposite his enemy’s 
army. Some time passed without any action; then one day, notic¬ 
ing that the Jaunpur army was off its guard, Buhlul suddenly 
attacked it. The Jaunpur army fled practically without offering 
any resistance, and though Husain managed to escape, his family 
was captured. Buhlul, however, treated them with marked res¬ 
pect, and later sent them to Jaunpur. 

Husain thus lost the best chance he ever had of capturing Delhi. 
Next year he again attacked Delhi at the instigation of his wife, 
but was again defeated. Shortly after, Husain invaded Delhi for 
the third time, but was defeated by Buhlul at Sikhera, about twenty- 
five miles east of Delhi. 

Shortly after this, on the death of Husain’s father-in-law, ‘Alam 
Shah, the last Sayyid king, who had retired to Badaun, Husain 
seized the district dispossessing his brother-in-law. He also captured 
Sambhal from BuhluFs governor Tatar Khan Lodi, and took him 
prisoner. He then again marched on Delhi in March 1479. This 
time Husain suffered a total defeat and Buhlul Lodi conquered prac¬ 
tically the whole of his kingdom. Husain retired to Bihar where he 
seems to have been left in occupation of a small territory yielding a 
revenue of five lakhs of rupees. According to Nizam-ud-dln, Buhlul, 
“acting in a spirit of generosity, did not interfere with him”. But 
after Buhlul’s death, when Sikandar ascended the throne of Delhi, 
Husain induced Sikandar’s brother Barbak, the governor of Jaunpur, 
to rebel, as has been narrated above. After Sikandar had conquer¬ 
ed Jaunpur from Barbak, he proceeded against Husain as the latter 
was the instigator of troubles. The course of this campaign has 
been narrated above. Husain was unable to make any stand against 
Sikandar, who annexed his territory. Husain then fled to Bengal 
where he was granted asylum by Sultan ‘Ala-ud-dln Husain Shah. 
There he passed his last days in obscurity.

E. BENGAL 

1. the independent sultans 


The administration of Bengal had always been a serious problem 
of the Delhi Sultanate. Taking advantage of its remoteness from 
the capital and facilities for naval warfare, with which the Turks 
of upper India were unfamiliar, the governors of Bengal frequent¬ 
ly behaved as independent rulers, and not seldom openly defied 
the authority of Delhi. The last serious rebellion, that of Tughril, 
was sternly repressed by Balban, 1 but the events following the death 
of that Sultan once more made Bengal an independent kingdom 
under his son Bughra Khan, who ruled at Lakhnawati (Muslim 
capital, Maldah district) under the style of Sultan Nasir-ud-din. 
After the historic interview of Nasir-ud-din and his son, Sultan 
Kaiqubad, mentioned above, 2 the independence of Bengal was 
tacitly recognized by the Delhi Sultanate. But the news of the 
tragic end of the House of Balban at Delhi gave a rude shock to the 
ease-loving Nasir-ud-din who abdicated in favour of his son 
Hukn-ud-din Kaikaus in A.D. 1291. 3 The boy-king Kaikaus ruled 
over Bengal and Bihar and issued coins and inscriptions till at least 
A.D. 1298. He was succeeded, probably about A.D. 1301, by Shams- 
ud-din Firuz Shah who had wielded great power and authority during 
the reign of the ease-loving Bughra Khan, and after his death 
became the governor of Bihar. According to Xbn Batutah, Firuz Shah 
belonged to the House of Balban, and was the son of Nasir-ud-din; 
but the absence of the usual phrase ‘Sultan bin (son of) Sultan’ on 
the coins of Firuz throws grave doubts on this claim. Nor is it 
known whether he peacefully occupied the throne after the death 
of Kaikaus, or secured it by violent means. 4 

During the reign of Rukn-ud-din Kaikaus and Shams-ud-din 
Firuz, Muslim rule was extended to South and East Bengal, and 
important centres were established at Satgaon (Hughli district) and 
Sonargaon (Dacca district). Firuz extended his conquests across 
the Brahmaputra into the Sylhet district of Assam (now in Eastern 
Pakistan) and probably founded the city of Firuzabad-Piandua, the 
future capital of Bengal. 43 The reign of Shams-ud-din Firuz was 
disturbed by the rebellion of his sons, Shihab-ud-din Bughdah and 
Ghiyas-ud-din Bahadur, who supplanted respectively the authority 
of their father at Lakhnawatl and Sonargaon during the period 
710-714 A.H. (A.D. 1310-14). Firuz recovered Lakhhawati in 

A.D. 1315 but Shihab-ud-din was ruling there in A.D. 1317-18 while 
Ghiyas-ud-din disputed its sovereignty with his father during 
A.D. 1320-22. On the death of the latter in or shortly after A.D. 1322, 
Ghiyas-ud-din Bahadur Shah probably murdered all his brothers 

193

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


save Nasir-ud-din Ibrahim and Shihab-ud-din, and ruled both in 
Lakhnawati and Sonargaon. 

According to Ibn Batutah, some of the amirs who rebelled 
against Prince Jauna (Muhammad bin Tughluq) during the siege of 
Warangal took shelter with Shams-ud-din Firuz Shah. After his 
death his son Shihab-ud-din succeeded him but his youngest brother 
Ghiyas-ud-din Bahadur Bura (black) defeated him, seized the throne 
and killed most of his brothers. Two of these, Shihab-ud-din and 
Nasir-ud-din, fled to the Emperor Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq who 
marched with them against the usurper Ghiyas-ud-din. 5 How far 
this account is true, cannot be determined, as it is not corroborated 
by any other source. According to Barani, “certain noblemen came 
from Lakhnawati complaining of the oppressive laws under which 
they were suffering, and informed the Sultan of the distress and 
tyranny under which they and other Musulmans laboured.” So Sultan 
Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq resolved to march against Lakhnawati 6 

In any event, Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq now decided to re¬ 
assert his authority over Bengal. He left Delhi at the beginning of 
A.D. 1324 and was joined at Tirhut by Nasir-ud-din Ibrahim, son of 
Shams-ud-din Firuz Shah. Ibrahim is referred to as the “ruler of 
Lakhnawati”, both by Barani and Tsami, but whether he was ever 
actually in possession of the capital city or was a mere rival claimant 
to the throne, it is not easy to determine. In any case Lakhnawati 
was not under his control at the time. The Sultan sent Nasir-ud-din 
with his adopted son and best general Bahram Khan, alias Tatar 
Khan, at the head of a select body of troops. When the imperial 
troops reached the neighbourhood of Lakhnawati, Bahadur came 
out of the town and a severe fight ensued. Bahadur, being defeated, 
fled away, but was taken prisoner. Tughluq Shah confirmed 
Sultan Nasir-ud-din in the government of North Bengal with its 
capital at Lakhnawati. Eastern Bengal and Southern Bengal, with 
capitals respectively at Sonargaon and Satgaon, were annexed to the 
empire and Bahram Khan was appointed to govern them. Bahadur 
was taken captive to Delhi. 

The tragic death of Emperor Ghiyas-ud-din at the end of his 
return journey from Bengal and the accession of Muhammad bin 
Tughluq have been mentioned above. Sultan Nasir-ud-din Ibrahim, 
as a loyal vassal of Delhi, issued coins in the names of himself and 
the Emperor of Delhi till 726 A.H. (A.D. 1325-26), when Muhammad 
Tughluq appointed Qadr Khan feudatory of Lakhnawati. 7 Though 
nominally subordinate to Sultan Nasir-ud-din, Qadr was the de 
facto ruler, directly responsible to the Emperor. This polic 3 r of 
“checks and balances” was also adopted in Eastern Bengal by 


194 


BENGAL 


Muhammad bin Tughluq. He released Bahadur and sent him back 
to Sonargaon as its vassal king, to rule the country in co-operation 
with Bahram Khan as the Emperor’s own representative. Satgaon 
was placed under Tzz-ud-dln Yahya who was created Azam-ul-Mulk. 

Sultan Nasir-ud-dm Ibrahim is known to have accompanied 
Muhammad bin Tughluq when the latter proceeded against the 
rebel Kishlu Khan. But Naslr-ud-dln’s name was omitted from the 
coins after A.H. 726 (A.D. 1325-26). This was virtually a deposi¬ 
tion, but Nasir-ud-din was allowed to retain his title of Sultan. 

The other nominal Sultan, Ghiyas-ud-din Bahadur Shah of 
Sonargaon, played a more important role. For about three years, 
until 728 A.H. (A.D. 1327-28), he issued coins in the joint names 
of himself and Muhammad bin Tughluq and pulled on well with 
the imperial general Bahram Khan. It was during this period that 
the Muslim empire was extended beyond the Meghna river and the 
territory represented by modern Tripura state (Tipper a) and 
Chittagong district was conquered and annexed to the Delhi Sulta¬ 
nate. 

But Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Bahadur Shah was evidently made 
of sterner stuff than his brother Nasir-ud-dm, and was unwilling to 
play the second fiddle like him. The virtual deposition of the latter 
probably also urged him to make a bold bid for independence. 
According to ‘IsamI, he rebelled, but was defeated by Bahram Khan 
and fell a captive in his hands. Bahram killed him, flayed his skin 
and sent it to the Emperor, Muhammad bin Tughluq, who received 
it shortly after the suppression of the revolt of Kishlu Khan. 
According to Ibn Batutah, Ghiyas-ud-din was released by Muhammad 
bin Tughluq on certain conditions, one of which was that Ghiyas-ud- 
din’s son should be sent as hostage to the Emperor. As this 
promise was not fulfilled, the Emperor sent troops against him. This 
took place, according to Ibn Batutah, before Kishlu’s rebellion. 8 

For ten years after the death of Bahadur, Bengal remained a 
quiet province under the Delhi Sultanate, its three well-defined re¬ 
gions of Lakhnawatl, Sonargaon and Satgaon being ruled respectively 
by Qadr Khan, Bahram Khan, alias Tatar Khan, and Tzz-ud-dln 
Yahya. 

2. FAKHR-UD-DIN MUBARAK SHAH 

On the death of Bahram Khan, the governor of Sonargaon, in 
738 A.H. (A.D. 1337-8) his silcih-dar (armour-bearer) and right-hand 
fan, Fakhr-ud-dln, assumed the government. But before any new 
governor was appointed by the Sultan, he rebelled and declared 


195 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


himself king under the title of Sultan Fakhr-ud-din Mubarak Shah 
(738 A.H..). 9 He signified his independence by assuming royal 
titles and such boastful epithets as “Yamm-Khallfa-i-Allah” (Right 
hand of the Vicegerent of God) and “Nasir-i-Amir-ul-Mu’minln’’ 
(Assistant of the Commander of the Faithful). This bold assumption 
of independence could not be ignored by Sultan Muhammad bin 
Tughluq who directed the governors of Kara, Lakhnawatl and SaL 
gaon to undertake a joint campaign against the rebel Fakhr-ud-dm, 
The combined army marched to Sonargaon and expelled Fakhr-ud- 
dm. Shortly after, the governors of Kara and Satgaon went to 
their headquarters, leaving Qadr Khan, the governor of Lakhnawatl. 
in possession of the capital city of Sonargaon. Qadr Khan’s refusal 
to share the captured booty with his soldiers by giving them their 
legitimate share created great disaffection among them. The fugi¬ 
tive Fakhr-ud-dln had in the meantime gathered round him a large 
number of soldiers. He carried on secret negotiations with the dis¬ 
contented soldiers of Qadr Khan w 7 ho openly rebelled and murdered 
him. Thereupon Fakhr-ud-dln recovered Sonargaon without any 
difficulty. 

Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq was now fully occupied with 
the numerous rebellions that had broken out in various parts of the 
empire. Fakhr-ud-dln took full advantage of this opportunity and 
sent an army under a ghuldm of his, Mukhlis, to occupy Lakhna¬ 
watl. But ‘All Mubarak, the paymaster of Qadr Khan’s army, killed 
Mukhlis and established his authority at Lakhnawatl. Although he 
was not formally appointed governor by the Sultan, he kept up 
for some time the pretence of vassalage to the court of Delhi by 
making humble representations. But as soon as he felt secure of his 
position, he threw away the mask and asserted his independence. 
He ascended the throne about A.D. 1340 under the title of ‘Ala-ud-din 
‘All Shah and ruled till A.D. 1345 when he was overthrown by 
Shams-ud-din Ilyas Shah. 

Fakhr-ud-dln carried on intermittent fights with the ruler of 
Lakhnawatl, but could not achieve any success. But this failure did 
not in any way affect his position in Eastern Bengal. Here he ruled 
in peace and set up a stable administration, to which reference is 
made by Ibn Batutah who visited his kingdom in A.D. 1346 and has 
left a glowing account of its prosperity. 

Fakhr-ud-dln died in 750 A.H. (A.D. 1349-50) and was succeed¬ 
ed most probably by his son Ikhtiyar-ud-din Ghazi Shah. He reigned 
for three years when East Bengal was conquered by Shams-ud-din 
Ilyas Shah. 10

3. ILYAS SHAH (A.D. 1339-1359) 

While Fakhr-ud-din and ‘Ala-ud-din ‘Ali Shah were ruling res¬ 
pectively at Sonargaon and Lakhnawati, a new figure appeared on 
the political stage. This was Ilyas, an officer (but according to the 
Riytiz, the foster-brother) of ‘All Shah. Nothing is known of his 
early career save that he was a servant of Qadr Khan who address¬ 
ed him as brother, 103 but he issued coins in 740 A.H. (A.D. 1339- 
40). 11 As ‘Ala-ud-din ‘All Shah of Lakhnawati issued coins till 743 
A.H. and Fakhr-ud-din and his son ruled in Sonargaon from A.D. 
1339 to 1352, it is very likely that Ilyas Shah first established his 
authority at Satgaon 12 (753 A.H.). In any case Ilyas made himself 
master of Lakhnawati some time about 746 A.H. (A.D. 1345-6), and 
assumed the title of Shams-ud-dln Ilyas Shah. 

The accession of Shams-ud-dln Ilyas Shah to the throne of 
Lakhnawati opened a new chapter in the history of Bengal. He 
founded a dynasty of able and vigorous kings who won military 
glory and revived Bengal’s contact with the outside world. He 
achieved the political unity of Bengal and carried his victorious 
arms far outside the boundaries of Bengal. He overran Tirhut and 
made a bold thrust across the inhospitable region of Terai into the 
fastness of Nepal, which was yet untrodden by Muslim soldiers. He 
advanced as far as the capital Kathmandu, destroyed the holy temple 
of Svayambhunatha and returned with a rich booty. The invasion, 
which was of the nature of a plundering raid, took place in A.D. 1350 
and the Nepalis claim to have defeated the Muslim invader. 13 

The Sultan next turned his attention to Orissa. The Gahga kings 
had often invaded Bengal during the preceding century and were 
still in possession of a part of Western Bengal. But the ruling king 
of Orissa, Bhanudeva II, was weak, and Ilyas advanced through Jaj- 
pur and Katak as far as the Chilka lake. He despoiled the temples 
of Orissa and returned with a rich booty including 44 elephants. 
Finally he led a campaign against Eastern Bengal. He defeated 
Ikhtiyar-ud-din GhazI Shah, the ruler of Sonargaon, and annexed his 
dominions in 753 A.H. (A.D. 1352-3), as mentioned above. 

But the Sultan was soon to meet a formidable enemy. Sultan 
FIruz Shah, who had succeeded Muhammad Tughluq on the throne 
of Delhi in A.D. 1351, naturally viewed with great concern the rise 
of a powerful independent kingdom in Bengal and decided to over¬ 
throw it. Within a year or two of his accession he equipped a 
powerful army and led it in person against Bengal. 14 He marched 
through Awadh and took with him a number of boats to faci¬ 
litate the crossing of the many streams that lay on the way. Sultan 
Ilyas boldly faced the danger. His flotilla disputed the passage of 


197 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the imperial army at important ferries across the Sarayu and the 
Gandak and retreated according to plan to the junction of the Kusi 
and the Ganga. Firuz was unable to cross the rivers in the face of 
the resolute stand made by the Bengal flotilla, and therefore made 
an outflanking movement. He marched northward along the Kusi 
as far as the foothills to a place called Jiaran. With the help of the 
local Raja he could easily ford the Kusi which was very narrow at 
this point. The imperial army then marched direct to Pandua (or 
Flruzabad), the capital city, about eleven miles from the modern 
English Bazar (Maldah District). Ilyas, unable to resist the enemy 
in the open field, evacuated Pandua and took shelter in the fortress 
city of Ekdala. Sultan Firuz occupied Pandua without any oppo¬ 
sition and then attempted to win the sympathy of the local people 
by issuing a proclamation. 14 ^ He promised complete security of 
life and property to the inhabitants of Pandua, and having declared 
Ilyas Shah a rebel and an impious Muslim called upon the people to 
disown him as their Sultan. He made very tempting offers to those 
who would desert the cause of Ilyas. To the captains of paiks (in¬ 
fantry) he promised double their allowance on joining with their 
full quota of contingents; to the land-owners, remission of the cur¬ 
rent year’s revenue and other pecuniary advantages; and to the Mus¬ 
lim theologians, increased land-grants and stipends. But this appeal 
having produced no effect, Sultan Firuz marched to Ekdala. This 
city of which no vestiges remain today, was situated in a loop formed 
by the rivers Baliya and Chiramati, two tributaries of the Maha- 
nanda, in the Dhanjar pargana of the Dinajpur District. 15 Inside 
this watery barrier were built a cantonment and a royal villa with 
space for large settlements. The whole area was girt by a massive 
rampart made of adhesive clay, peculiar to the locality, surrounded 
by a moat, sixty feet wide. ‘Afif calls it an island ( jaztra-i-Ekdald ) 
on account of its being surrounded by water on all sides. 

Unable to take the fort by assault, Sultan Firuz completely 
blockaded it in order to starve Ilyas to submission. There were 
sporadic fighting and skirmishes without any effect on either party 
After the siege had continued for about two months, there were indi¬ 
cations of the approach of the rainy season, and Sultan Firuz decided 
to raise the siege and return to Delhi. But before doing so he sent 
some spies disguised as Qalandar monks into the fort of Ekdala who 
assured Ilyas Shah that the besieging army was in acute distress. So 
when one day Sultan Firuz raised the siege and his army began to 
march away, Ilyas threw off all caution and pursued the imperial 
troops with his entire army. 

Sultan Firuz, however, was marching in perfect order in antici¬ 
pation of the enemy and as they came in sight, he swung round, with 


BENGAL 


his army drawn up in good battle order. Thus Ilyas Shah could not 
avoid an engagement and a violent contest followed. The imperial 
troops hurled back the Bengalis repeatedly as they surged forward, 
and before the sun had set, the Bengalis were seen fleeing away from 
the battlefield in confusion and disorder. The battle thus ended in 
the discomfiture of the Bengalis. 

The court-historians, as usual, magnify the success of imperial 
arms. According to ‘Aflf, after much fighting and slaughter, Shams- 

ud-din retreated and fled towards his own city. Forty- 

eight elephants were taken, and three were slain. The king of 
Bengal, out of all his enormous force, fled with only seven horsemen, 
and his whole army was scattered”. According to Yahya, Ilyas fled 
without any fight and a large number of his soldiers was killed. Later 
writers have followed suit. But such a view is hardly compatible 
with the events that followed. According to ‘Aflf, Firuz proceeded 
after his victory to Ekdala and again besieged the town. Thereupon 
“all the ladies and respectable women went to the top of the fort, and 
when they saw him they uncovered their heads, and in their distress 
made great lamentation”. Firuz, moved by this spectacle, decided 
not “to storm the fort, put more Musulmans to the sword, and ex¬ 
pose honorable women to ignominy”. “Tatar Khian repeatedly 
urged the Sultan to retain the territory he had conquered, but the 
Sultan was averse to annexation”. Having decided to quit Bengal 
the Sultan gave an order “for collecting the heads of the slain Ben¬ 
galis, and a silver tanka was offered for every head. The 

heads were counted and amounted to rather more than 180,000 for 
the battle had raged for a whole day over an extent of seven kos. . 
.The Sultan then turned with his army and march¬ 
ed quickly towards Delhi.” ‘Afif further observes: “The rains hav¬ 
ing commenced, Firuz Shah had to abandon the investment, came to 
terms with Ilyas and retired towards his own dominions by the 
Manikpur ferry”. This is repeated by Nizam-ud-din and Badauni. 
Yahya simply says that “the Sultan halted there (battlefield) for two 
days, and on the third day he made his way to Delhi.” 16 

The terms of the peace are not stated, but it is obvious that 
Shams-ud-din continued to rule as an independent king, even though, 
the court historians refer to him as paying tribute. The true posi¬ 
tion may be gathered from the following statement of Nizam-ud-din: 
“The same year (757 A.H.) Ilyas Haji sent fitting tribute, and became 
the recipient of imperial favour. At this time the entire country 
of Hindustan was in the possession of the Sultan except Lakhnauti 
and the Dakhin; since the death of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq Shah, 
Sultan Shams-ud-din Ilyas Haji was in possession of the former 
As a matter of fact, almost every year after the return of Firuz from 


199 





THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Bengal, “plenipotentiaries from Ilyas Haji of Lakhnawatl with 
valuable presents” came to Delhi. “They became recipient of ex¬ 
cessive favours and endless affections”. Such exchanges of presents 
and tokens of goodwill, as obtain only between two sovereigns, con¬ 
tinued till the death of Shams-ud-dln Ilyas, and leave no doubt that 
the ruler of Bengal was recognized by FIruz as an independent sove¬ 
reign. They also indirectly prove that the campaign of FIruz in 
Bengal, which probably lasted for about two years from November 
1353 to September 1355, was a failure. The thinly veiled pretext of 
the court historians to explain the retreat of the Sultan is not likely 
to deceive anybody. 

Ilyas Shah’s successful challenge to the authority of the Sultan 
of Delhi sheds lustre on his reign. As soon as FIruz turned his back 
he re-occupied his capital city Fandua and re-established his autho¬ 
rity as far as the banks of the Kusl. He may justly be said to have 
inaugurated a glorious period in the history of Bengal. Towards 
the close of his reign he added one more laurel to his crown by lead¬ 
ing a successful campaign against Kamrup to which a detailed refer¬ 
ence will be made in Chapter XIII-D. 

Hardly anything is known of the character and personality of 
Ilyas Shah. The Riydz calls him Bhdngra i.e. a smoker of Bhang, a 
popular narcotic generally indulged in by lower classes in Bengal. 
It is, however, difficult to accept the casual opinion expressed by such 
a late authority. According to ‘Aflf, Ilyas suffered from leprosy for 
which he visited the tomb of Salar Mas‘ud Ghazi and rubbed the dust 
of the place on his body. ‘Aflf was not very kindly disposed towards 
the enemy of his patron, and his statement is therefore not above 
suspicion. The death of Sultan Shams-ud-dln Ilyas Shah probably 
took place in 758 A.H. (A.D. 1356-7). 

Ziya-ud-din Baranl has painted the personal character and ad¬ 
ministration of Ilyas in the blackest hue. It is obvious that he has 
taken his cue from, and sometimes even reproduced verbatim, the 
proclamation issued by Sultan FIruz to justify his campaign against 
Ilyas. According to this proclamation, Ilyas was guilty of oppression 
and highhandedness upon the people of Lakhnawatl and Tirhut 
(Baranl adds: both Hindus and Muslims), shed unnecessary blood, 
even of women, levied illegal cesses etc., so much so that there was 
no security of life and property, no safety for honour and chastity. 
Baranl repeats all this and adds that Ilyas brought ruin upon Bengal 
and destroyed many Muslim cities; he was both tyrannical and 
treacherous. 17 

These views were undoubtedly propagated by the Delhi court 
in order to justify the invasion of a Muslim kingdom by FIruz. But 


200 


BENGAL 


war propaganda cannot be regarded as historical truth without 
corroboration from independent sources. Such corroboration is, how¬ 
ever, entirely lacking. On the other hand, the proclamation, which 
held out tempting rewards to those Bengalis who would desert the 
cause of Ilyas and join the Sultan, fell flat upon the people of Bengal 
who were undoubtedly the worst sufferers from the tyranny of Ilyas 
if the allegations against him had any basis in fact. It is there¬ 
fore unreasonable to accept the accusation against Ilyas, although it 
has the authority of the great historian of the period. 

4. SULTAN SIKANDAR 

Ilyas Shah was succeeded by his son Sikandar. The most 
memorable event of his reign was another invasion of Bengal by 
Sultan Firuz. The first campaign of the Sultan was a failure, for 
though he gained possession of Bihar he had to acknowledge by a 
treaty the right of the Sultan of Bengal to rule independently the 
rest of his possessions. It is very uncertain whether, left to him¬ 
self, he would have sought to disturb this arrangement for he 
maintained very cordial relations with Ilyas as mentioned above. 
But an unexpected event in A.D. 1357 induced him to make one 
further attempt to re-establish the authority of Delhi over Bengal. 
Zafar Khan Fars, a Persian nobleman and son-in-law of Sultan 
Fakhr-ud-din Mubarak Shah of Sonargaon, left that place after its 
conquest by Ilyas Shah, and having reached Tattah in Sind by a voy¬ 
age round the coast, ultimately went overland to Delhi. Sultan 
Firuz received him cordially and assigned him a palace and a suitable 
allowance for his stay in Delhi. He is also said to have been appoint¬ 
ed ndib-wazir. Either at his instigation, or encouraged by the pros¬ 
pect of help w r hich could be rendered by a member of the old ruling 
family, Firuz conceived the idea of recovering Bengal. The death 
of Ilyas Shah appeared to him to be suitable opportunity to carry 
out his plan. He repudiated the treaty with Ilyas Shah on the 
ground that Sikandar was disloyal and had violated the treaty con¬ 
cluded by his father, declared Zafar Khan as the legitimate ruler 
of Bengal, and once more personally led a military expedition to 
Bengal. 18 With a mighty army consisting of 80,000 cavalry, 470 
elephants and a large body of infantry, Sultan Firuz marched through 
U.P. and, after considerable delay on the way, reached Bengal in 
A.D. 1359. Sikandar followed the strategy of his father, and 
having avoided an open engagement took shelter in the island fort¬ 
ress of Ekdala. Firuz besieged the place and, as before there were 
light actions and skirmishes with no decisive result. On one occa¬ 
sion, one of the principal bastions of the fort of Ekdala crashed down 
under the weight of the men assembled on it, and the generals of 


201 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the imperial army urged their master to make an immediate 
assault upon the fort through the breach. Firuz, however, over¬ 
ruled the suggestion, and the court-historian ‘Afif, as usual, attri¬ 
butes this forbearance on the part of the Sultan to a chivalrous 
consideration for the honour of the Muslim women inside the fort. 19 
It appears, however, to be more likely that faced with the deter¬ 
mined courage of the enemy and the skilful leadership of Sikandar, 
FIruz decided to pull his army out of Bengal. The disagreeable 
climate of Bengal and its mosquitoes, and the approach of monsoon 
must have also influenced his decision. So he brought the cam¬ 
paign to a close by concluding a treaty with the Sultan of Bengal. 

It is worthy of note that it was Sultan FIruz who took the 
initiative in opening overtures for peace. He chose as his envoy 
one of his Bengali officials named Haibat Khan two of whose sons 
were employed under the Sultan of Bengal. Haibat ably conduct¬ 
ed the negotiations and a treaty was concluded on the basis of 
political status quo. Sikandar acknowledged the cession of the 
country to the west of the KusI to Sultan FIruz, who in his turn 
waived the claim of Zafar Khan to Sonargaon, and sealed the treaty 
by conferring upon Sikandar a golden crown valued at 80,000 tankas 
in a formal ceremony of investiture. According to ‘Aflf, FIruz had 
demanded and Sultan Sikandar readily agreed to assign Sonargaon 
to Zafar Khan, but the scheme fell through as Zafar Khan declined 
the offer on the ground that “he and his family were so happy and 
secure under the government of Delhi.” This can only be taken 
as an ill-concealed attempt to save the face of Sultan FIruz. 20 
Nobody can fail to perceive that this second invasion of Bengal 
by Firuz, like the first, was a failure, as he could not achieve the 
object for which he had undertaken the expedition. The formal 
recognition of Sikandar as an independent ruler by Sultan Firuz 
marks the last attempt by the Sultans of Delhi to reassert suzerainty 
over that province, and for nearly two centuries Bengal was left in 
peace without any interference from the imperial court. 

A Sanskrit inscription 2021 on a pillar at the entrance of a temple 
at Panchadharala in the Vizagapatam District of the Andhra Pra¬ 
desh records that King Choda II of the Kona-mandla (Godavari 
Delta) “set about in aid of the harassed Sultan of Panduva, van¬ 
quished the Emperor of Dilli (Delhi), and gave the goddess of victory 
together with twenty-two elephants to the king of Utkala (Orissa).” 
As the grandson of Choda II ruled in A.D. 1403, it is reason¬ 
able to conclude that Choda II helped the Sultan of Bengal against 
Firuz Shah Tugluq when the latter had invaded Bengal, Pandura be¬ 
ing obviously by the Sanskrit form of Pandua, the capital of 
the Sultans of Bengal. It is difficult to say whether the help 


202 


BENGAL 


was rendered during the first or second expedition of Flruz. It 
would appear from the Sanskrit inscription that King Choda II of 
m1 a. was a feudatory of Orissa and probably supplied a 
contingent on behalf of his overlord. So the help was really given 
by the ruler of Orissa, and this may be one of the reasons why Firuz 
invaded Orissa before he returned to Delhi after his second expedi¬ 
tion in A.D. 1359, as mentioned above. 2013 

The prosperity of Sikandar’s reign is evidenced by the many 
architecutral remains of his age, such as the mosque at Adlna, 
built by the Sultan in A.D. 1368, which ranks as one of the most 
famous monuments of the Muslim rule in India. But the last years 
of Sikandar’s life were embittered by palace intrigues. He had 
seventeen sons by his first wife and only one by the second. The 
latter, suspecting that his father’s ears were poisoned against 
him by his step-mother, fled to Sonargaon and openly revolted 
against his father. He conquered Sonargaon and Satgaon and the 
long-drawn contest was finally decided in his favour in a pitched 
battle near the capital city in which Sikandar was defeated and 
killed (1390-91 A.D.). 

5. THE SUCCESSORS OF SIKANDAR 
(i) Ghiyas-ud-din A‘zam Shah. 

The successful rebel prince ascended the throne under the title 
of Ghiyas-ud-din A‘zam Shah. 21 According to the Assam Buranjis, 
A‘zam Shah led a military campaign against Kamata when its king 
was engaged in hostilities with the neighbouring Ahom king. In the 
face of the Muslim invasion the two Hindu kings made up their quar¬ 
rel and drove the Bengali army beyond the Karatoya. 

Meng-tsau-mwun (Naraimekhala), the king of Arakan, being 
expelled from his kingdom took shelter in the court of A‘zam who 
made an unsuccessful effort to restore him to his throne. A’zam main¬ 
tained friendly relations with Khvaja Jahan, who founded the in¬ 
dependent kingdom of Jaunpur. According to the Arakanese chro¬ 
nicle, the next king of Jaunpur, Ibrahim, invaded Bengal. The 
attack was, however, successfully repulsed with the new tactical 
methods of war introduced by the fugitive king of Arakan who lived 
in the court of Pandua at that time. 

To A‘zam Shah belongs the credit of having opened up the old 
contact between India and China. A friendly correspondence with 
the Celestial Emperor was followed by the despatch of envoys from 
Bengal in A.D. 1405 and 1409. The Chinese Emperor received the 
envoys cordially and sent presents for the Sultan and his wife. He 
also sent his own envoy to India to take back with him Buddhist 


203 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


monks to China. A Bhikshu named Mabaratna Dharmaraja travel¬ 
led to China in A.D. 1410-11 and revived the ancient cultural ties 
between the two countries. Mahuan, the interpreter attached to 
the Chinese embassy that visited Bengal in A.D. 1409, has left a very 
interesting account of the people of Bengal, particularly their dress, 
manufactures and pastimes, to which reference will be made later. 22 

Reference may be made to two anecdotes which throw interest¬ 
ing light on the character and personality of Sultan Ghiyas-ud- 
dln A‘zam Shah. Once he accidentally killed the son of a widow 
who complained to the qazi. The Sultan, being summoned to the 
court, humbly appeared and paid the penalty as decided by the 
qazi. At the end of the trial the Sultan told the qazi that if he 
had failed to do his duty he would have been beheaded. The qazi 
retorted with a smile that if His Majesty had not submitted to his 
orders he would have scourged him. Another story runs to the 
effect that the Sultan composed the first line of a verse in honour 
of his three favourite concubines, but unable to complete it; appeal¬ 
ed to the famous poet Hafiz, who not only supplied the second line 
to the distich but also sent another ghazal to the Sultan. 

According to the very late authority, the Riydz, Ghiy!as-ud- 
din was murdered by Raja Ganesa, to whom reference will be made 
later. But the earlier authorities like Nizam-ud-dln and Firishta 
do not refer to any such event, and we may well believe that the 
Sultan died a natural death, after a long reign, in A.D. 1410. 

(ii) Saif-nd-dln Hamzah (A.D. 1410-12) 

Ghiyas-ud-din A‘zam Shah was succeeded by his son Saif-ud-din 
Hamzah Shah whose coins are dated 813 and 814 A.H. He therefore 
probably ruled from A.D. 1410 to 1412. The Chinese sources, how¬ 
ever, suggest that he ruled till A.D. 1420, But, as the next three kings 
regularly issued coins in 816, 817 and 818 A.H., it is difficult to 
accept the Chinese version, unless we accept the suggestion that 
there were rival claimants ruling simultaneously in different parts 
of the kingdom. 23 But we have no evidence in support of such an 
unusual state of things. The only fact known about Saif-ud-din is 
that he continued the friendly relation with the Chinese court. 

(iii) Shihab-ud-din Bdyazld Shah (A.D. 1413-14) 

Shihab-ud-din Bayazid Shah, the son and successor of Saif-ud- 
din Hamzah Shah, continued the friendly relation with China and 
once sent a giraffe to the Chinese Emperor with a letter written on a 
golden leaf. The animal, unknown in China, aroused great curiosity 
in the country.

(iv) ‘ Ald-ud-din Ftruz Shah ( A.D . 1414-15) 

Shihab-ud-din Bayazid Shah issued coins in 816 and 817 A.H. 
Coins were issued by his son ‘Ala-ud-din Firuz Shiah in 817 A.H. 
from Mu‘azzamabad and Satgaon. It is not unlikely, therefore, that 
‘Ala-ud-din, exasperated with the ascendancy of Raja Ganesa at his 
father’s court, set himself up as an independent monarch in East and 
South Bengal. It is, of course, equally, or even more, possible 
that the death of the father and the accession of the son took place 
in course of the year 817 A.H. In any case we find a new monarch, 
Jalal-ud-din Muhammad, issuing coins in 818 A.H. (A.D. 1415-16), 
bringing to an end, for the time being, the rule of the Ilyas Shahi 
dynasty. In order to understand the nature of this revolution and 
the course of events which brought it about, it is necessary to go 
back a little. 


6. RAJA GANESA 

During the reigns of the successors of Sikandar Shah occurred 
an event, almost unique in character in the annals of Muslim rule 
in India, namely the successful usurpation of royal authority by a 
Hindu chief. Unfortunately, though the main fact is beyond all 
doubt, the details of this Hindu interregnum are not known with 
any definiteness. The reconstruction of the history of the period 
also offers many difficulties, and has consequently given rise to a 
number of problems and theories. 24 These need not be discussed 
here in detail, and only a brief resume of the main incidents must 
suffice. 

The name of the Hindu usurper is written by Muslim historians 
as Raja Kans or Kansi, but some Hindu sources give it as Ganesa, 
and this is now regarded as the real name. He was a local zamindar 
in North Bengal (of Dinajpur or Rajshahi according to different 
traditions) and is referred to in a contemporary Muslim source as 
a member of a very old zamindar family of 400 years’ standing. 

Ganesa came into prominence during the reign of Ghiyas-ud- 
din A‘zam Shah. As noted above, according to the Riydz, a Muslim 
chronicle written in A.D. 1788, Sultan A‘zam Shah was treacher¬ 
ously killed by Ganesa, but this is not corroborated by any other 
source. In any case we know that the Sultan was succeeded by his 
son, Saif-ud-din Hamzah Shah, and the latter by Shihab-ud-dm 
Bayazid Shah, as mentioned above. But all our main sources indi¬ 
cate that Saif-ud-din was a very weak ruler, and the real power 
was wielded by the nobles, generals, and the influential members 
of the government. It appears that Ganesa became the most power¬ 
ful among these nobles and played an important political role after 


205 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the death of Ghiyas-ud-din A‘zam Shah. Firishta says that Ganesa 
“attained to great power and predominance during Shihab-ud-din’s 
reign and became the de facto master of the treasury and kingdom”. 
This is probably true, but we possess different versions of the subse¬ 
quent course of events. According to Firishta, on the death of 
Shihab-ud-din, Ganesa usurped the throne, while the Riyaz repre¬ 
sents Ganesa as having attacked and killed Shihab-ud-din and 
seized the throne. On the other hand, according to the Tabaqdt-i - 
Akhari, it was only after Shihab-ud-din’s death that Ganesa acquired 
'domination’ over Bengal for seven years; and after his death his son 
turned Muslim and took the title of Sultan Jalal-ud-din. The plain 
implication is that Ganesa was really a king-maker, and wielded 
the chief power, but did not crown himself as a king, and placed his 
own son on the throne after conversion to Islam. Evidently he was 
the head of a strong political faction at the court consisting of both 
Hindus and Muslims, and he sought to placate the latter and main¬ 
tain his power by converting his son to Islam. 

The Riyctz, which represents Raja Ganesa as having crowned 
himself king of Bengal after killing Shihab-ud-din, gives a long 
and circumstantial narrative of his reign which may be summed up 
as follows: 

“Raja Ganesa subjugated the whole kingdom of Bengal. He 
oppressed the Muslims, slew a number of them, and his aim was 
to extirpate Islam from his dominions. Thereupon the great saint 
Nur Qutb-ul-ATam appealed to the Sharqi ruler, Sultan Ibrahim, 
to save Islam. The Sultan accordingly invaded Bengal with an 
army. Thereupon Raja Ganesa waited on the saint and asked for 
his forgiveness and protection. The saint agreed to intercede for 
him provided he adopted Islam. Raja Ganesa agreed, but his wife 
having objected to this course, his son Jadu, a boy of twelve, was 
converted by the saint, re-named Jalal-ud-din, and placed on the 
throne. At the request of the saint, Sultan Ibrahim returned to his 
kingdom and died shortly after. As soon as Ganesa heard this news, 
he set aside his son and himself ascended the throne a second time. 
He again began to oppress the Muslims and even had the son of 
the saint murdered by his agent. At that very moment Ganesa also 
died ‘and passed to hell’. Jalal-ud-din, who was reconverted to 
Hinduism by his father, had refused to re-embrace Hinduism. Ac¬ 
cording to some account, he was in prison but slew his father with 
the help of some servants. The rule of Ganesa lasted for seven 
years.” 

The account given in the Riyaz is substantially corroborated by 
three letters written by a saint of Jaunpur named Hazarat AshralT 


206 


BENGAL 


Jahangir Sinnani. 24a One of these gives the purport of the letter 
which Nur Qutb-ul-A‘lam wrote to the Sharqi ruler, Sultan Ibrahim 
of Jaunpur. It begins with lamentations over the sad plight of 
Islam brought about in Bengal by the infidel king Kans (Ganesa) 
who has usurped the throne. He then urges upon Sultan Ibrahim to 
invade Bengal without delay. “The fire of infidelity is raging 
in Bengal and you are keeping your sword in your sheath”, says he. 
He concludes: “Don’t sit at rest for even an hour on your throne. 
Come and overthrow this infidelity by your sword.” 

What followed may be briefly described on the authority of 
these letters and other evidences. Sultan Ibrahim invaded Bengal 
and Ganesa fled. Ibrahim put on the throne the son of Ganesa who 
was converted to Islam and then returned to Jaunpur. Ganesa 
now again appeared on the scene and became the de facto, if not 
also dc jure , ruler of Bengal. Though Nur Qutb-ul-A‘lam laments 
over this fact in a letter to his son, he did not evidently invoke the 
aid of the Sultan of Jaunpur as he did before. 

The statement that the Riydz, vouched for by Firishta, that 
Ganesa actually ascended the throne, is discredited by some modern 
historians on numismatic evidence. For, while no coin of Raja 
Ganesa has actually come to light, we have coins of the Muslim 
rulers, mentioned above, regularly issued up to 817 A.H. and also 
those of Jalal-ud-din, the son of Ganesa, dated 818, a few of 819 A.H. 
and again regularly from 821 to 835 A.H. 

So far no coin of Jalal-ud-din of 820 A.H. has come to light, 
and this gap has given rise to a very interesting theory. For two 
series of coins issued by a king called Danujamardana-deva in Saka 
1339-40 and Mahendra-deva in Saka 1340 (also probably 1341) have 
come to light. The following equivalents of dates have been re¬ 
garded as of great significance in tracing the sequence of events. 

A.H. 820 (for which we have no coins of Jalal-ud-din) 
=February 18, 1417, to February 7, 1418, 

Saka 1339=April 1416 to April 1417 
Saka 1340=April 1417 to April 1418 
Saka 1341==April 1418 to April 1419 

A.H. 821 (for which we have coins of Jalal-ud-din) 

—February 8, 1418 to January 27, 1419. 

On the basis of this sequence of coins Dr. N. K. Bhattasali 25 
formulated an ingenious theory about the history of Raja Ganesa 
mainly on the lines of the Riyaz’s narrative. According to him 
Ganesa assumed the title Danujamardana-deva on ascending the 


207 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


throne in A.D. 1417, and ruled for a short period of less than two 
years, after which his son again occupied the throne in A.D. 1419. 
This view is accepted by many scholars. 26 

Dr. Bhattasali further held che view that Mahendra-deva was 
the title assumed by the son of Ganesa after his reconversion to 
Hinduism and before his second conversion to Islam (after his 
father’s death) when he again took the name Jalal-ud-dln. This 
view is, however, not accepted even by those who favour the identi¬ 
fication of Ganesa with Danujamardana-deva. Some of them hold 
that after the death of Ganesa, the Hindu party in the court raised 
his second son to the throne under the title Mahendra-deva, who 
was soon ousted by his renegade elder brother Jalal-ud-dln. 27 

Recently a writer 28 has urged the view that Ganesa never 
actually ascended the throne, but was the de facto ruler for seven 
years during the reigns of the puppet king ‘Ala-ud-din Firuz and his 
own son Jalal-ud-dln who succeeded ‘Ala-ud-din Firuz immediately 
after his death. The same writer regards Danujamardana-deva and 
Mahendra-deva as local chiefs in East and South Bengal who as¬ 
serted independence during the troubles caused by the usurpation 
of Ganesa and the invasions of Ibrahim Shah Sharqi. Although this 
view cannot be lightly set aside, the theory that Ganesa was identi¬ 
cal with Danujamardana-deva seems to be the most satisfactory 
hypothesis offered so far, though it cannot claim to be anything more 
in the present state of our knowledge. 

But whatever view one might take regarding the theory of 
Dr. Bhattasali, the fact remains that Raja Ganesa, a Hindu chief 
wielded royal authority either as a de facto or de jure king for 
some time and succeeded in passing the inheritance to his family. 
This reveals the strength of the Hindu chiefs at the time, a con¬ 
clusion which gains additional force if Danujamardana-deva and 
Mahendra-deva are regarded as local rulers of East and South 
Bengal, w r ho asserted independence and maintained it for more than 
two years. The revival of Hindu monarchy was, of course, no more 
than a passing episode, but it gives us a glimpse of the political 
situation in Bengal, of which we have no other evidence or even 
any vague indication. Incidentally, the letter of the saint Nur 
Qutb-ul-Aham and the acceptance of Ganesa’s son as king by the 
Muslims as soon as he was converted to Islam illustrate the strong 
repugnance of the Muslims to live under a Hindu ruler. They also 
indicate that the cleavage among the people in Bengal was more 
on religious than on racial or political lines.

7. THE HOUSE OF RAJA GANESA 

*» • 

Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Shah (A.D. 1415-1431) 

Though we possess but a vague picture of Raja Ganesa as the 
ruler of Bengal, all authorities agree that he was succeeded by his 
son who had assumed the title Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Shah on 
his conversion to Islamic faith. 

The very fact that he ruled in peace for a long time after the 
troublesome period extending over more than ten years shows that, 
though belonging to a Hindu family which ousted the dynasty of 
Ilyas Shah, he enjoyed the confidence and received the support of 
the clerical party and the Muslim nobility. Jalal-ud-din ruled with 
absolute authority over the whole of Bengal from the KusI river in 
the north-w 7 est to Chittagong on the south-east, and from Fathabad 
and Satgiaon in South Bengal to the border of the Karatoya in the 
north-east. Few facts of his reign are known from the Persian 
chronicles. Coins alone indicate the extent of his dominion, and the 
monuments give us an idea of the increased wealth and prosperity 
of the country under his sway. 

His coins issued in 821 A.H. (A.D. 1418) from Fathabad, gene¬ 
rally identified with Faridpur town, show that this region was con¬ 
quered and brought under the Muslim rule during his reign. If 
Ganesa alias Danujmardana-deva extended his authority over 
Chittagoang, Jalal-ud-din Muhammad, as his successor, consolidated 
his authority over it and annexed to it a portion of Tipperah. A 
curious type of his coinage, having on the reverse the figure of a 
lion with the forepaw raised, resembles the type that was prevailing 
in the contemporary state of Hill Tipperah, and it has been rightly 
argued that this type w T as adopted in order to make the currency 
acceptable to the people of a portion of Tipperah conquered by the 
Sultan. But the issue of this type of coinage may not unreasonably 
be taken as a clear indication of the temporary hold of the Bengal 
Sultan over the whole state of Tipperah. Jalal-ud-dln’s contempo¬ 
raries Mukuta-Manikya and Maha-Manikya on the throne of. 
Tipperah, if the account of the Rdjamdld is to be believed, were 
feeble rulers, and the submission of any of these tw T o kings to the 
authority of the Bengal Sultans is quite plausible. A coin issued 
from a new mint-town read as ‘Rotaspur’ by Lane-Poole would 
favour the view of Jalal-ud-din’s extension of authority over 
Rohtasgarh in South Bihar. As Dr. Dani has pointed out, such an 
assumption requires further proof. It may, however, be said that 
Rohtasgarh in the 15th century lay within the sphere of the autho¬ 
rity of the autochthonous Chero tribe. Though situated in South 
Bihar it was an almost inaccessible place, and presumably beyond 

209 


D.S.—14 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the sphere of the Sharqi king’s authority. Rhotasgarh, as attested 
by the Gaya inscription of Asokachalla-deva, was connected with 
Bengal as late as the 12th century A.D., and an extension of Jalal- 
ud-din’s foothold over this strategic outpost to counteract invading 
armies from the west was quite possible. 

Firishta applauds him by saying that “he upheld the principles 
of justice and equity and became the Naushlrwan of the age,” This 
remark is corroborated by the evidence of Sanskrit works, the 
Smriti-ratnahdra and the Pada-chandrikd and refutes Buchanan 
Hamilton’s account of his having persecuted the Hindus. 

According to the Pdda-chandrika, the commentary on the 
Amarakosa, he promoted a Brahman named Brihaspati Misra of 
Kulingram in the present Burdwan district to the position of 
Sarvabhauma-Pandita (Court-Pandita). This Sanskrit scholar wrote 
commentaries on the Meghaduta, Kumdra-sambhava, Raghuvamsa, 
Sisupdlavadha, Amarakosa, and composed a digest on Hindu rites 
and ceremonies called the Pada-chandrikd. Whether he was a 
teacher of Jalal-ud-din in his boyhood or not, the Sultan lavished 
gifts and honours on him. According to the interpretation of a 
Sanskrit sloka by D. C. Bhattacharya, another Hindu, Sri Rajyadhara 
was raised to the position of an army commander. 29 Another Hindu, 
Visvas Rai, son of Brihaspati, is mentioned as having been a minister 
to Gaudesvara who was no other than Sultan Jalal-ud-din. 

Visvas Rai and others are described in a passage of the Pada- 
chandrikd as so many gems on the crest of king’s (Jalal-ud-din’s) 
minister. They had composed valuable works on all the different 
branches of learning. Under Jalal-ud-din Muhammad, Flruzabad- 
Pandua became a populous and flourishing town and it is recorded 
in the Ming-she that a Chinese, bearing the name of Cheng-ho, 
visited this city twice in his sailing craft, once in A.D. 1421-22 and 
again in A.D. 1431-33. The city of Gaur, representing the old capital 
of Lakhnawati, began to be repopulated in his time. Sultan Jalal- 
ud-din himself contributed to its development by constructing build¬ 
ings and sardis. 

Originally a Hindu, but converted into Islam, Jalal-ud-din 
ruled Bengal roughly from A.D. 1415 to 1431. He extended the 
frontiers of the kingdom of Bengal, and kept up overseas 
communication with China which perhaps stimulated the growth of 
Chittagong as an entrepot of trade. The coins issued from 
Mu'azzamabad, near Sonargaon after the lapse of two decades, and 
the new mint-town of Fathabad presumably indicate their growth as 
ports, consequent on the expansion of river-borne trade.

The singular fact about this monarch is that though a neo- 
Muslim, he was free from bigotry, which is usually the characteristic 
of such persons. His mortal remains are buried in the superb 
mausoleum, EkhlakhI tomb in Pandua, which is regarded by Cunning 
ham as a very fine specimen of Muslim architectural style in Bengal 
in the pre-Mughul age. 

(ii) Shams-ud-din Ahmad Shah (A.D. 1431-35) 

Jalal-ud-dln Muhammad was succeeded by his son, Shams-ud- 
din Ahmad Shah, who ruled for a short period, from A.D. 1431 to 
1435. According to Firishta, he followed the liberal policy of his 
father and was renowned for justice and charity. The only im¬ 
portant event that is known of his reign was the invasion of his 
kingdom by Ibrahim Shah Sharql of Jaunpur. Ahmad Shah, unable 
to withstand him in the field, applied to Shah Rukh, the son of 
Timur, in Herat, seeking his intervention. The Bengal envoys 
rounded the entire coast of India, in a seafaring vessel, and Shaikh- 
uMslam Karlm-ud-dln Abul-’l Mukarim JamI was sent by the king 
of Herat with a message to the Sharql king, forbidding such an 
aggression. 30 Ahmad Shah kept up the friendly intercourse with 
China and a Chinese embassy visited Bengal in A.D. 1431-32. 

Ahmad Shah’s reign was abruptly terminated by his assassi¬ 
nation at the hands of two of his nobles, Shadi Khan and Naslr 
Khan, in A.D. 1436. It has been surmised that the Sultan’s murder 
was precipitated by the outbreak of a “sort of rivalry between 
the Hindu and the Muslim nobles”. 31 Such an inference is far¬ 
fetched and rests on not very solid ground. 

8. THE RESTORATION OF THE ILYAS SHAHI DYNASTY 

(i) Nasir-ud-dln Mahmud Shah (A.D. 1437-59) 

After the assassination of Shams-ud-din Ahmad Shah, Shadi 
Khan and Naslr Khan fell out with each other and were overthrown 
one after the other. A member of the Ilyas Shah! dynasty now 
ascended the throne under the title of Nasir-ud-din Mahmud in 
841 A.H. (A.D. 1437-1438). 32 A large number of inscriptions be¬ 
longing to his reign refer to the construction of public works and 
generally indicate an era of peace and prosperity. This was partly 
due to the fact that he was freed from the menace of the Sharql 
rulers on the western front on account of their long-drawn struggle 
with the Lodi Sultans. But there were military campaigns on other 
fronts. The kings of Orissa held a large part of Western Bengal, 
and probably extended their frontier to the Bhagirathi during the 


211 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


troubles of the second decade of the fifteenth century. King Kapi- 
lendra-deva of Orissa is referred to in an inscription, dated A.D. 
1447, as Gaudesvara (Lord of Gauda or West Bengal). He also claims 
to have defeated “Malika Parisa”. This has been taken by some to 
refer to the Muslim Sultan of Bengal, and by others to Mallikarjuna, 
the king of Vijayanagara. Another inscription of Orissa refers to 
the defeat of two Turushka kings, one of whom has been identified 
with Nasir-ud-din Mahmud. 33 

There was also fighting on the Arakan front during his reign. 
All Khan, the successor of Meng-tsau-mwun (Naraimekhala) men¬ 
tioned above as having taken shelter with Sultan Ghiyas-ud-dln 
A‘zam Shah, initiated the policy of pushing his frontier towards the 
north. He annexed Sandowy and Ramu and his successor, Baswpyu 
(Kalim Shah, A.D. 1459-82), took possession of Chittagong in 1459 
which remained usually in Arakanese hands until the Mughul con¬ 
quest and occupation of the place in A.D. 1666. In one direction, 
however, the frontier of Bengal was extended, for the Bagerhat 
region of the Khulna district was conquered by Khan Jahan to 
whom the local tradition gives the credit of the first Muslim coloni¬ 
zation of this area. 34 An inscription on his tomb at Bagerhat records 
his death to have occurred in 863 A.H. (A.D. 1458-9). 

The transfer of the seat of royalty to Gaur probably took place 
during his reign and it was perhaps necessitated by a change in the 
course of the river on which the old capital Pandua stood. Mint- 
towns and inscriptions of his reign, scattered all over the country 
from Bhagalpur to Bagerhat, testify to his extensive sway lasting 
until A.D. 1459. As noted above, the KusI had been the frontier of 
the kingdom of Bengal under the early Ilyas Shahls, but the inclu¬ 
sion of Bhagalpur within Mahmud Shah’s territory shows that the 
western frontier had been advanced further west under him. 

(ii) Rukn-ud-din Bdrbak Shah (A.D. 1459-74) 

Rukn-ud-dm Barbak Shah, who peacefully succeeded his father 
on the throne, w 7 as a powerful ruler. During his reign the frontiers 
of Bengal were extended in different directions for which popular 
tradition gives the credit to Shah Ismafil GhazI, a popular saint of 
North Bengal. He waged war with the Hindu kings of Kamata on 
the north-eastern and Gajapati Kapilendra, king of Orissa, on the 
south-western frontier. The career of this warrior saint is nar¬ 
rated in a work entitled the Risdlat-us-Shuhadd compiled by Plr 
Muhammad Shattari in A.D. 1633. 35 It appears from this work as 
well as the Madldpanp, the chronicle of the temple of Jagannatha 
at Puri, that he carried on his military operations against Orissa 
from his base at Mandaran, near Arambagh in Hughli district and 


212 


BENGAL 


that he was the master-spirit directing the operations of the Bengal 
army in the long-drawn struggle against Orissa. 36 Shah Ismahl 
also distinguished himself in fighting with the king of Kamata which 
was separated from Bengal by the Karatoya. It is stated that the 
GhazI contested the Kamata army at Santosh in Dinajpur district 
and sustained defeat. 36a The account of his death in A.D. 1474, 
owing to the intrigues of Bhandasi Rai, as given in the Risdlat, is a 
fable, for the saint lived long enough to wage war against Gajapati 
Prataparudra-deva in the first quarter of the 16th century. 

The Surma valley (Sylhet) was first conquered in 703 A.H. 
(A.D. 1303-4) by Sikandar Khan GhazI, but it appears to have 
slipped from Muslim control after the reign of Fakhr-ud-dln 
Mubarak Shah, some time about A.D. 1351. The Hatkhola inscrip¬ 
tion of 863 A.H. (A.D. 1458-59) shows that Sylhet was reoccupied 
by the Muslims under Rukn-ud-dln Barbak Shah. The Arakanese 
had seized Chittagong during Nasir-ud-dln Mahmud’s reign, but if 
w*as reconquered by Barbak, as he is referred to as the reigning 
king in the RastI Khan inscription of 878 A.H. (A.D. 1473-74). 

Fathabad (generally indentified with Faridpur town) had form¬ 
ed an integral part of Jalal-ud-dln Muhammad Shah’s kingdom but 
the netwvork of rivers and channels still kept most of the Barisal 
district outside the pale of the kingdom of Gaur. Military activity 
is indicated by the inscription of Ulugh-i-Xqrar Khan, mentioned as 
the shiqcldr of Jor and Barur, in the Purnia district and West Dinaj- 
pur. King Yakshamalla of Nepal is said to have conquered MIthila. 37 
If this account be taken as correct, Iqrar Khan’s activity might be 
due to a clash with the Nepalese forces. 

Barbak Shah’s reign was remarkable in the history of 
medieval Bengal and the stir caused in the dormant life of this 
country was reflected in the vernacular work, Sri-Krishna-vijaya, 
composed by Maladhar Basu, who was awarded the title of Gunaraj 
Khan. The prosperity of the kingdom was evinced by additions to 
the palace at Gaur, the digging of an underground channel for sup¬ 
ply of water inside the palace, and many laudatory phrases about 
the Sultan’s personality and character. 

(iii) Shams-ud-dm Yiisuf Shah (A.D. 1474-81) 

Rukn-ud-dln Biarbak was succeeded by his son Shams-ud-dm 
Yusuf Shah who ruled until A.D. 1481. He is described as a learned 
and virtuous man and an efficient administrator, but hardly any¬ 
thing is known about his reign. His coins do not bear the mint- 
names but the distribution of his inscriptions from Gangarampur 
in Dinajpur district to Sylhet, and from Bandar town (opposite the 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


port of Narayanganj) and Mirpur, about seven miles north of 
Dacca, to Pandua in the Hughli district, indicate the extent of his 
sway. Similarly the buildings erected in his reign indicate the 
prosperity of the times. He was the builder of the Jaml‘ Mosque 
at Darriasbari in A.D. 1479 and perhaps also the founder of the col¬ 
lege which stamped its name upon the locality. 38 Cunningham and 
Creighton have also ascribed to him the erection of three other 
superb buildings at Gaur, on the evidence of inscriptions, discover¬ 
ed in the neighbourhood, bearing his royal title. These are 
(1) Chamkatti mosque, so called for its use by a body of monks who 
used to gash their skin ( cham ), with a knife; (2) Lotton Masjid 
which, according to Francklin, “is unsurpassed for elegance of style, 
lightness of construction and tasteful decoration in any part of 
Upper Hindustan”; and (3) the Tantipara mosque, so called for its 
situation in the weavers’ quarter of Gaur. 

(iv) Jaldl-ad-dm Fath Shah (A.D. 1481-87) and the 
end of the Ilyas Shahl Dynasty. 

Yusuf was succeeded by Sikandar, probably his son, but Jalal- 
ud-dln Fath Shah, a son of Sultan Nasir-ud-din Mahmud, ascended 
the throne after deposing Sikandar Shah on the ground that he was 
afflicted with lunacy. About this time the body of Abyssinian 
slaves, first employed by Rukn-ud-dln Barbak as palace guards, 
grew very powerful and insolent. The Sultan took steps to curb 
their power and, as a result, was assassinated by the commander 
of the palace-guards, Sultan Shahzada, who ascended the throne 
under the title of Barbak Shah. Hardly had six months elapsed 
when he was supplanted by the Abyssinian commander of the army, 
Amir-ul-Umara c Malik Andil, who assumed the sceptre under the 
title of Saif-ud-din Firuz in A.D. 1487. Thus ended the rule of the 
Ilyas Shahl dynasty which forms a brilliant chapter in the history 
of medieval Bengal. 

9. ABYSSINIAN RULE 

The accession of Saif-ud-din Firuz led to the rule of the Abyssi- 
nians at Gaur for a period of six years. Saif-ud-din was an able 
ruler and the inscriptions testify to his sway from Sherpur in 
Mymensing District in the north to Satgaon in the south. According 
to Ghulam Husain Salim, he had great sympathy for the poor and 
opened the treasury for them. The Firuz Minar at Gaur has been 
attributed to him simply on the ground that it bears his name. But 
the precarious nature of his position and the short tenure of his 
power are strong arguments against this view.

BENGAL 


Nasir-ud-dln Mahmud, who succeeded FIruz in A.D. 1490, is 
stated by Firishta to have been a son of Jalal-ud-dln Fath Shah. 
This is more likely than the description of him by Nizam-ud-dln as 
the son of FIruz, for the extant coins do not mention his royal 
descent. He was very young and the administration was carried on 
by the regent, Habash Khan, an Abyssinian, who was shortly killed 
by another Abyssinian, named Sldl Badr. Sldl Badr, who assumed the 
regency, had the boy-king killed with the help of the palace-guards 
and ascended the throne under the title of Shams-ud-dln Muzalfar 
Shah (A.D. 1491). He is described as a tyrant whose violence and 
cruelty alienated the nobles as well as the common people. It 
was mainly due to the ability and wisdom of his wazir, Sayyid 
Husain, that he could maintain his rule for three years. But his 
ruthless massacre of the nobility and his exhorbitant demands of re¬ 
venue precipitated an armed rising which was aggravated by the 
disaffection of the soldiers caused by the reduction of their pay. 
The wazir, Sayyid Husain, secretly sympathized with the rebels 
and ultimately put himself openly at their head. The rebels be¬ 
sieged the citadel where the Sultan had shut himself with a few 
thousand mercenaries. The siege dragged on for four months and, 
according to Firishta, the Sultan lost his life in course of a desperate 
sally from the citadel. But according to Nizam-ud-dln, he was 
secretly assassinated by Sayyid Husain with the help of the parks. 
Thus ended the dark period of Abyssinian rule in Bengal. 

It is worthy of note that while these phantom and tyrannical 
rulers succeeded one another in quick succession, the people, both 
Hindu and Muslim, looked upon the palace intrigues and revolu¬ 
tions with complete indifference. Indeed the complacence with 
which the people submitted to the rule of the puppet Sultans 
appeared so strange to the outsiders that Babur made the follow¬ 
ing comment in his Memoirs: “There is indeed this peculiarity of 
the royal office itself that any person who kills the ruler and occu¬ 
pies the throne becomes ruler himself. The amirs , wazirs, sol¬ 
diers, and peasants submit to him at once and obey him. The 
Bengalis say ‘we are faithful to the throne, we loyally obey who¬ 
ever occupies it.’ 39 It was not till Sultan Muzaffar inaugurated a 
veritable reign of terror that the Bengalis cast off their lethargy 
and rose against the tyrant 

10. ‘ALA-UD-D1N HUSAIN SHAH (A.D. 1493-1519) 

The origin and early life of Sayyid Husain are involved in 
obscurity and have given rise to many legends. 40 According to some 
accounts, he was a born Arab who had recently settled in Bengal. 
According to local traditions, he was a native of the Rangpur district 


215 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


in north Bengal (now East Pakistan). Several stories, however, 
associate him with a village named Chandpara in Murshidabad 
district. 

The stages by which Husain came to occupy the post of chief 
minister of Muzaffar Shah are not known to us. He showed re- 
markable wisdom and prudence in discharging the duties of his 
high office, but as he could clearly apprehend the doom that was 
sure to overwhelm the tyrannical ruler, he joined the rebels and 
led them to victory. Thereupon the popular choice naturally fell 
upon him, 41 particularly as no member of the House of Ilyas Shah 
seems to have survived the Abyssinian rule, and he ascended the 
throne under the title ‘Ala-ud-din Husain Shah, probably in 
A.D. 1493. His long reign of more than a quarter of a century 
ushered in a new era of peace and prosperity which offered a strik¬ 
ing and welcome contrast to the troublesome period that preceded it. 

Husain gave evidence of his firmness immediately on his acces¬ 
sion to the throne. He issued strict orders to the victorious soldiers 
to desist from pillaging the capital city, but as they continued to 
plunder, he sternly put them down by having executed twelve 
thousand of them. The search for the pillaged articles led to the 
discovery, among other things, of 13,000 gold plates, which indirect¬ 
ly reflects the wealth of the country. It was a long-standing 
practice of the Bengali upper class to take their food in gold 
plates, and Firishta remarks that the greater the display of them 
by an individual on days of festivity, the greater was the esteem. 42 

After the restoration of order in the capital, Sultan Husain took 
steps to consolidate his position. He disbanded the paiks who, by 
the strength of organization and solidarity in their ranks, had be¬ 
come, like the Turkish janissaries, the masters of the palace. 

He next dismissed the large body of Abyssinians who had filled 
the high posts in the administration, and expelled them from the 
country. He appointed Sayyids, Afghans, Turks and, the scions of 
the old aristocracy of the land in their place and, supported by 
them, restored order and security in the country. 

‘Ala-ud-din Husain Shah’s reign forms an epoch in the history 
of independent medieval Bengal. It was a reign of long duration 
during which the Sultan, by his liberal policy, administrative effi¬ 
ciency, and territorial conquests developed the prosperity of the 
country, a fact amply attested by the monuments erected during 
his time. The internal peace and security, the facilities for trade 
and commerce, and the opportunities opened to the indigenous 
aristocracy for military operation against the Mongoloid races 
living on the eastern frontier of Bengal and the Gajapati king of 


21(3 


BENGAL 


Orissa, infused a new spirit among the people of the province which 
was reflected in the contemporary vernacular literature. 

The embarrassing pre-occupation of Sultan Husain was the 
adjustment of his relation with the Sultans of Jaunpur and Delhi. 
About the time of Sultan ‘Ala-ud-dm Husain’s accession, inter¬ 
minable fighting between the Sultans of Jaunpur and the Lodi 
overlords of Delhi had practically caused an eclipse of the Sharql 
power which was then confined only to Bihar. In A.D. 1495, Sultan 
Sikandar Lodi led his army into this stronghold of the Sharql king, 
who implored the protection of the Bengal Sultan. ‘Ala-ud-dm 
Husain, who was watching this development, promptly responded 
by deputing a force under his son Daniyal against the Afghan army. 
The two forces met at Barh, about 30 miles east of Patna. It is a 
testimony to Husain’s armed strength that Sultan Sikandar halted 
the advance of his army in the face of the Bengali opposition, and 
concluded a treaty of friendship on terms of territorial status quo 
and guarantee of non-aggression into each other’s territory. Accord¬ 
ing to this arrangement, the country to the west of Barh passed 
under Sultan Sikandar’s authority, while the country east of it, 
including Mungir and South Bihar, remained under Sultan ‘Ala-ud- 
dm Husain’s occupation. 

During the period A.D. 1200-1493, the Muslim Sultanate of 
Bengal had gradually extended up to the hill ranges on the eastern 
frontier. The annexation of a large portion of Bihar and the influx 
of the disbanded Jaunpur soldiery that followed the dissolution of 
the Sharql kingdom, now infused a new vigour to the Bengal 
Sultanate. Sultan Husain’s first target of attack was the Kamata- 
Karnrup kingdom which had long been a great bulwark against 
Muslim penetration in the north-east. Nilambara, the king of 
Kamata, fell out with his minister, who thereupon came to the court 
of Gaur and incited the Sultan to a war against his old master. 
Husain fell in with this idea and, according to a popular tradition, 
the war was carried into the Kamata territory by Shall Isma‘il 
Ghazl. The capital city was well fortified, but the Muslim army 
gained admission into it by a ruse, took king Nilambara prisoner, 
and pillaged the city. This was followed by the advance of the 
Muslim army, and the whole kingdom as far as Ha jo in the Kamrup 
district was permanently annexed. The whole operation lasted 
presumably from A.D. 1499 to 1502 when the conquest of this 
large stretch of territory was publicly recorded by Sultan Husain 
in an incription at Malda. 43 

The Kamata-Kamrup expedition was followed by that against 
Jajnagar-Orissa whose frontier extended as far as the river Saras- 


217 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


vatl, embracing within its fold practically the whole of Midnapore 
and part of the Hughli district. Gajapati Kapilendra and his 
successor Prataparudra were mighty kings whose forces constantly 
menaced the enemy and carried on intermittent skirmishes on the 
long frontier along the river Sarasvatl which, though now dried 
up, carried the volume of the water of the Ganga in those days. 
According to the Madlapanp, the chronicle of the Jagannatha 
temple, Shah Isma‘il Ghazi issued out of his base at Mandaran in 
Arambagh district about 1508-9 and swept onward in a lightning 
campaign to Puri, raiding Jajpur and Katak on the way, and destroy¬ 
ing many Hindu temples. The resounding victory was celebrated 
by the issue of coins stamped in the name of Jajnagar-Orissa. At 
the news of the sudden burst of the Muslim army, Gajapati Pratapa¬ 
rudra returned from the campaign in the south and drove back the 
invading force until he reached Mandaran near Arambagh. The 
fortress was besieged by the exultant Oriya army, but they failed to 
take it owing to the treachery of an officer named Govinda 
Vidyadhara. Sultan Husain’s lightning raid was a brilliant success. 
His forces, however, had to beat a hurried retreat from Orissa and 
any modification in the Bengal-Orissa frontier proved to be a task 
beyond his strength, in spite of his increased strength and resources. 
Hostilities were intermittent along the border throughout the reign 
as would be borne out by the account of Chaitanya’s journey to 
Orissa, when he had to cross the Ganga at Sri Chhatrabhog with 
the aid of the local frontier official, Ramachandra Khan, in A.D. 1509. 
On his return journey four years later, Sri Chaitanya found the 
frontier disturbed as before. It appears that Sultan Husain’s success 
here was limited to maintaining the status quo against the great rival 
Prataparudra. 

In the segment of the eastern frontier abutting on Tippera, also, 
the Sultan achieved very little success. A section of the Mongoloid. 
people known by the name of the Tiperais, who had originally dwelt 
in the recesses of the Agartala hills, had spread across the alluvial 
plains along the bank of the Gumti until the whole country from 
Agartala to the Meghna was dominated by them. These people had 
been drawn into close contact with the Muslim power, immediately 
after its establishment in Sonargaon, and we may easily infer that 
the primary need of defence induced Fakhr-ud-dln to build the high¬ 
way from his capital to Chandpur. During the 14th and 15th cen¬ 
turies hardly a glimpse of the Bengal Sultan’s relation with these 
people is available, excepting the casual indication of Sultan Jalal-ud- 
dln Muhammad’s sway over a portion of the Tipperah kingdom. Sul¬ 
tan Husain made strenuous efforts to conquer this hill kingdom. 
According to a late chronicle, the Rajamdla, he despatched his army 


218 


BENGAL 


on four successive occasions, but the hill people fought heroically and 
do not appear to have yielded ground at all. The first expedition 
is said to have been an abject failure. The second achieved some 
initial success by advancing beyond Comilla and seizing the fort of 
Meherkul, but the Tiperai general, alleged to be Rai Chaichag, 
annihilated the Bengali force in course of its advance towards the 
capital, Rangamati, by a novel stratagem. The way lay across the 
Gumti which had to be forded. Rai Chaichag dammed the river at 
a place higher up the ford. As soon as the Muslim army, deceived 
by the dry bed of the river, began to cross it, the dam was cut off, 
upon which the roaring water swept away the horses and decimat¬ 
ed the bulk of the army. The third expedition shared a similar 
fate. The fourth expedition was distinguished by an engagement 
near the Kailargarh fort, with perhaps indecisive result. 

The net result of Husain Shah’s repeated expeditions cannot be 
precisely determined. The reference in the Sonargaon inscription 
of A.D. 1513 to Khawas Khan, as sar-i-lashkar (commander) of the 
country ( zarriin) of Tripura and wazlr of Mu‘azzamabad, has been 
taken by some 44 to signify that at least a part of Tipperah was 
annexed. But the title may as well refer to his role as the com¬ 
mander-designate of the forces mobilized against Tipperah. 

Husain Shah also sent military expeditions against Arakan. It 
appears that the Arakanese, acting on their own interest, had helped 
Raja Dhanya-Manikya in his struggle against Sultan Husain in the 
closing phase of the war, and gained possession of Chittagong by 
expelling the Bengali officers. In other words, Tipperah war be¬ 
came merged in that with the Arakanese. The conduct of the 
operation was assigned to Paragal Khan 4 ' 5 who advanced from his 
base on the Feni river. Hostilities appear to have lasted from 
A.D. 1513 to 1516. After Paragal, his son ChhutI Khan assumed 
charge of the campaign against the Arakanese which continued until 
Chittagong was wrested from their control. 

The Arakan campaign was probably the last military expedi¬ 
tion during the reign of Husain Shah who died in A.D. 1519. His 
reign is a memorable chapter in the history of medieval Bengal. 
After a period of troubles and turmoils he not only restored peace 
and prosperity in the country, but also extended the frontier of his 
kingdom in all directions. By his military exploits he added to his 
dominions a portion of modern Bihar and Assam, and recovered 
Chittagong from the Arakanese. According to the Portuguese De 
Barros, Arakan was a vassal of Bengal about this time, and this may 
mean a temporary assertion of suzerainty. 


219 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


In spite of almost continual fighting, the reign of Husain Shah 
is noted for many works of public utility and witnessed a remark¬ 
able development of Bengali literature to which reference will be 
made later. It was during his reign that Chaitanya preached his 
religion which ushered in a new era of social and religious reform 
among the Hindus in Bengal. The liberal attitude of Husain Shah 
towards the Hindus, which will be discussed elsewhere in detail, 
was an important factor in this renaissance of Bengal. Husain 
possessed a remarkable personality and his sense of justice, affability, 
and kindness made such a deep impression that a Hindu writer 
of the time described him as an incarnation of Krishna. 

Viewed as a whole, it may be said, without much exaggeration, 
that under Sultan Husain Shah, Bengal enjoyed such a spell of 
peace, prosperity, and all-round progress as she had not done before 
under any other Sultan. His reign may justly be looked upon as 
the most glorious in medieval Bengal. 

11. NUSRAT SHAH (A.D. 1519-1532) AND HIS SUCCESSORS 

On Sultan Husain’s death, the crown passed on to his eldest 
son Nusrat Shah, who followed the vigorous policy of his father and 
attempted to achieve the expansion of Bengal’s frontier in the east 
and west. Sultan Nusrat’s reign coincided with remarkable changes 
in the political set-up of northern India. In the early years of his 
reign the coalescence of the Afghans in eastern India against 
Sultan Ibrahim Lodi favoured his aggressive designs. According 
to Ghulam Husain Salim, he conquered Tirhut. In A.D. 1526 the 
Afghan supremacy was overthrown and the Mughuls established 
themselves in their place. The Mughul conquest of Delhi and Agra, 
followed by the dislodgrnent of the Afghans from their strongholds 
in the Doab, presented to Sultan Nusrat the problem of defending 
his kingdom against the Afghans driven eastward by Babur at the 
head of an army deemed invincible. The important political role 
played by Sultan Nusrat after 1526, ending with the treaty of peace 
concluded with Babur, can only be understood in the context of the 
Mughul conquest of India, and will be discussed in the next volume. 

Nusrat, as the heir to his father’s conquest in Kamata-Kamrup, 
carried on an active warfare in the eastern front, and invaded the 
Ahom kingdom of the Upper Brahmaputra valley in 1527. He was 
however defeated on all fronts by the Ahoms who pursued the 
Muslim troops as far as the Burai river. According to the Ahom 
Buranjis, the Ahoms took the offensive in A.D. 1529 and advanced 
along the Brahmaputra towards Hajo, the Muslim headquarter in 
this region. The Bengalis suffered the first reverse in a naval action 
at Temani (Trimohini), but they recovered from it and attacked the 


220 


SIND 


Ahom post at Singiri under their general Bit Malik who was 
defeated and driven back with heavy loss. After Sultan Nusrat’s 
assassination in 1532 the military operations were conducted by 
Turbak who captured the Ahom posts of Singiri and Sala, but the 
Ahoms got the better of him in two successive engagements, one on 
the Dikrai river in Sibsagar District and the other on the Bharali 
river in Tejpur District. In the stormy times that followed Nusrat’s 
assassination, the conquests in Assam and Kamata territory slipped 
away, and the two kingdoms pursued their own affairs without any 
interference from Bengal for nearly a century and a half. 

Nusrat was a great patron of Bengali literature, and his reign 
is memorable for a number of noble edifices erected during that 
period. Chief among these is the Great Golden Mosque (Bara Sona 
Masjid), built in A.D. 1526, which, on account of its dimensions, is 
reckoned as the largest of the ancient monuments in Gaur. In¬ 
crease of wealth as a consequence of the overseas trade was also 
reflected in the building of mosques at important ports and marts, 
e.g. at Satgaon in 1529, Sonargaon in 1523 and Mangalkot, on the 
bank of the Ajaya, in 1524. 

Sultan Nusrat lost his life at the hands of an assassin in A.D. 1532 
upon which his son ‘Ala-ud-din Firiiz seized the throne. He was 
supplanted shortly after by his uncle, Ghiyas-ud-din Mahmud Shah 
(A.D. 1533-38), the son of ‘Ala-ud-din Husain Shah, who was the last 
representative of the line of independent Muslim Sultans of Bengal. 
He was overthrown after a short reign by the Afghan genius Sher 
Khan Sur as will be described in the next volume. He has been 
condemned as having caused “the extinction of Bengal’s independ¬ 
ence by his incompetence.” Sultan Mahmud appears to have been 
a gay, pleasure-loving monarch. According to the Portuguese account, 
his harem contained ten thousand women. In such a decadent atmo¬ 
sphere he might have lost his soldierly qualities and thereby become 
unfit for parrying blows with Sher Khan Afghan. But whether his 
general policy, namely, that of alliance with the NuhanI chief of 
Bihar, and opposition to Sher Khan Sur, was unsound, can only be 
judged in the context of the history of Sher Khan which will be 
discussed in the next volume. 

F. SIND 
1. The Sumras 

Reference has been made above to the domination of the 
Saffarids (A.D. 872-903) in Sind and the rise of two separate States, 
namely, Multan and Mansurah, after the fall of that dynasty. Both 
of these had to accept the suzerainty of the Samanids who, as 


221 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


mentioned above, replaced the Saffarids as the dominant power in 
this region, but had themselves to yield to the Ghaznavids towards 
the end of the tenth century A.D. 1 

As noted above, Sultan Mahmud established his authority 
over Multan in A. D. 1010, 2 and it is likely that he also established 
his supremacy over Mansurah or Sind proper. According to the 
Tdrikh-i-Ma'suml the Sumras rebelled during the reign of his son 
Ma‘sud and placed a man of their tribe, also called Sumra, on the 
throne. This is the first definite reference to the Sumras who are 
known to have ruled in Sind for a long period. Unfortunately very 
little is known either about their origin or of their history. It has 
been suggested that they were Paramara Rajputs, but of this we 
have no authentic evidence. It is generally assumed, from the 
names of the later rulers of this dynasty, that the Sumras were 
Muslims. It is, however, very likely that they adopted their new 
faith at a later date; in any case, their conversion must have been 
a slow process. 

Ibn Batutah states of the Samiras, that is the Sumras, that 
“they do not eat with anybody nor can anyone look towards them 
when they are eating; nor do they marry among people other than 
their own, and no one marries in their fold.” 3 When Mahmud 
Begarha first invaded Sind to relieve the Sindhi Muslims from 
persecution by the Hindus, he came across Sumras and other tribes 
who were Muslims but knew little of Islam or its rules, and were 
wont to intermarry with and live as Hindus. 4 It is also interesting 
to note that the name of the last Sumra king, Hamir, was usually 
borne by a Hindu. 

The total region-period of the Sumras is given as 143 (lunar) 
years (A.D. 1300-1439) in the Tankh-i-Tahiri, but according to other 
authorities, it was 500 or even 550 years. 5 They certainly ruled till 
the middle of the fourteenth century A.D., and as we hear of them 
in the reign of Ma‘sud they must have ruled for a period of at least 
three hundred years. It is not, however, unlikely that they ruled 
for five hundred years as stated by Abu-’l Fazal and Nizam-ud-dm, 
for they might have established their power during the confusion 
that must have followed the Saffarid conquest of Sind. On the 
other hand, we do not know the name of any Sumra chief preceding 
the ruler of that name who successfully rebelled against Ma‘sud. It 
is probable that he was the real founder of the dynasty which was 
named after him. 

Sumra consolidated his position by marrying the daughter of a 
powerful chieftain named Sad, and was succeeded by his son Bhun- 
gar, who enjoyed a reign of 15 years. His son Duda, who extended 


222 


SIND 


his sway up to Nasrpur, died in 485 A.H. (A.D. 1092), and was 
succeeded by his minor son, Singhar. Singhar reigned for 15 years, 
during which period he seems to have conquered a part of Cutch. 
As he had no son, his wife Hamun took charge of the government 
after his death. Then followed a period of internal strife, after 
which one Pithu, a descendant of Duda, established himself as king. 

According to the Jagaducharita of Sarvananda, Pithadeva of 
Para (the peninsula on the north-east side of the Runn of Cutch 
which is still called Parkar) destroyed the whole of Cutch and 
reached Bhadresvara; after demolishing the ramparts of the city, he 
returned to Para. Ultimately the Chaulukya king Bhimadeva II 
(A.D. 1178-c. 1241) sent an army against Pithadeva who fled, and 
later died of excessive grief. 6 

Btihler identified this Pithadeva with the Sumra chief Pithu. If 
Biihler’s identification is accepted, the reign of Pithu cannot be 
placed earlier than the last quarter of the twelfth century A.D. 7 

Pithu was succeeded by one Khaira who, in his turn, was suc¬ 
ceeded by one Khaflf or Hafif, during whose long reign of 33 years 
the people are said to have been happy and content. It is during this 
reign that the Sammas are first mentioned. Khaflf appears to have 
been succeeded by Pithu’s son, ‘Umar, who ruled first 40 years. He 
was succeeded by his son Duda II, who died after a reign of 14 
years. 

Our two main authorities differ very widely regarding the 
successors of Duda II. While Mir Ma‘sum mentions only four kings 
ending with Armil, ‘All Sher Qani gives a long list of twelve kings 
ending in Hamir whose reign-periods exceed a total of more than 
two hundred years. As we know from a contemporary source 
that the name of the last king of the Sumra dynasty was Hamir 
Duda, the list of ‘All Sher Qani appears to be more authentic, but 
when he says that the Sumras were extirpated in a fight against 
Ala-ud-din, he is evidently wrong and probably makes a confu¬ 
sion between ‘Ala-ud-din Khalji and Muhammad bin Tughluq. In 
any case there is no doubt that the Sumras were succeeded by the 
Sammas in the sovereignty of Sind about the middle of the four¬ 
teenth century A.D. 

2. The Sammas 

All the kings of the Samma dynasty bore the title Jam, be¬ 
cause they claimed to have been descended from Jamshid. But 
there is hardly any doubt that this legendary origin is fictitious. 
It is interesting to note that there was another tribe in Sind, called 
the Thathwas(?) who also claimed descent from Jamshid, and this 
led to their quarrel with the Samma kings. 8 


223 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Lists of kings of the Samma dynasty are given by Nizam- 
ud-dln, Abu-’l Fazl, Firishta and Mir Ma‘sum. The names of the 
kings and their regnal periods, as given by the four authors, do 
not agree, the initial date for the beginning of the Samma rule is not 
stated, and the discrepancy makes it difficult to construct an 
exact chronology of the Samma chiefs. 9 Prof. Hodivala has 
pointed out that a fairly correct list can be made out on the basis 
of the following three or four fixed dates or epochs and two points 
of contact between provincial and imperial history, which can be de¬ 
termined with tolerable certainty. 10 


Accession of Jam ‘Unar c. 736 A.H. 

A.D. 1335 

” Fath Khan 801 A.H.

A.D. 1398 

” Nanda 866 A.H. 

A.D. 1461 

Death of ” Nanda 914 A.H. 

A.D. 1508 

By fitting these points into the framework of the names and re¬ 

gnal periods given in the lists, Hodivala suggested the following 

chronology: 


Name of the king 

A.D. 

Jam ‘Unar 

1335-1339

,, Banhbina

,, Salah-ud-din (usurper)

„ Flruz 

1508-1527 

The first part of this proposed chronology is, 

however, not free 


from difficulties. For, from the Munshat-i-Mahru it appears that 
the second and the third kings, namely, Junan and Banhbina, 11 the 
brother and son respectively of the first king, ‘Unar, were joint 
rulers. We also learn from the same work, that Hamlr Duda Sumra 
was still in Sind, though “the plant of his existence had been 
afflicted by the violent wind of calamities”. Flruz Shah was how¬ 
ever, helping Hamlr, apparently to set him up against Banhbina, 


224 


SIND 


as the latter in alliance with the Mongols had attacked Gujarat and 
the Punjab on several occasions. ‘Ain-ul-Mulk Mahru, the governor 
of Multan, was therefore writing to Flruz Shah’s governor of Sind 
to strengthen the position of Hamir, who had been granted a posi¬ 
tion and pension by Flruz Shah. Flruz had also entrusted Hamir 
to the charge of Malik-ul-Umara‘ Rukn-ud-dm Amir Hasan, the 
brother of the governor of Gujarat, to whom ‘Ain-ul-Mulk’s letter 
was addressed. ‘Ain-ul-Mulk hoped that “the position of Hamir 
Dtida will be strengthened (by the governor of Gujarat) as is desired 
by His Majesty (Flruz Shah), and both the territories of Gujarat and 
Sind will be freed from the menace of Banhbina (bin) ‘Unar, 
Otherwise nothing can prevent these handful of damned people 
from bringing infidels (Mongols) into the territories of Islam when¬ 
ever they like and looting and carrying off as slaves the subjects 
and the Dhimmis of Dar-ul-Islam.” This is the last, however, that 
we hear of Hamir, for in the letters that follow, Hamir is never again 
mentioned. From this it may be presumed that Hamir was the 
last Sumra king, as stated by ‘All Sher Qani. 

It appears from the letters of Mahru, that either Jam Junan 
and Banhbina were ruling jointly or had divided the kingdom 
amongst themselves. Jam Junan was loyal to Sultan Flruz, while 
Banhbina, as has been noted above, was creating trouble by raid¬ 
ing the imperial domains with Mongol help, from practically the 
beginning of Flruz Shah’s reign. Being afraid of reprisals, Banhbina 
once wrote a letter to Mahru justifying his (Banhbina’s) conduct, 
in reply to which Mahru wrote a stinging answer, which contains 
the interesting information that Sultan Flruz Shah had married 
Banhbina’s daughter. 

In spite of the remonstrances of Mahru, Banhbina did not change 
his ways so that Sultan Flruz, as noted above, was obliged to lead a 
campaign against him into Sind, which probably lasted from the end 
of A.D. 1363 to the first half of A.D. 1367. 12 Firuz carried to Delhi 
both Jam Junan and Banhbina, and several muqaddams and zamin- 
ddrs of Sind. Jam Junan’s son and Banhbina’s brother, Tamaehl, were 
left to rule jointly at Tattah, in return of a payment of four lakhs of 
tankas and a promise to send several lakhs every year with horses 
and other valuable things. 

Jam Junan and Banhbina were kept comfortably in their 
honourable captivity at Delhi, but very soon Tamaehl, the brother 
of Banhbina, broke into rebellion. Jam Junan, who had always 
been loyal, was therefore sent to Sind, and he managed to capture 
Tamaehl and sent him to Delhi. Jam Junan continued to rule at 
least up to May 1380.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


After the death of Sultan FIruz Shall (A.D. 1388), his successor 
Ghiyas-ud-dln sent Banhbina to Sind, probably because Jam Junan 
had died in the meantime. But Banhbina died on his way to 
Tattah. The Sammas probably took advantage of the weakness of 
the Delhi Sultanate during this period and declared their 
independence. 

Not much is known of the kings whose list is given above. 
Some of these usurped the throne and one was selected by the 
nobles. During the reign of Nanda, the last king but one, Shah Beg 
Arghun came from Qandahar in A.D. 1493, and occupied the fort 
of Sewl. Nanda managed to recover the fort, but, later, Shah Beg 
sent another army which not only reconquered Sewi, but captured 
the forts of Bhakkar and Sehwan also, and this time Nanda failed 
to recover his possessions. 

During the reign of Nanda, Mahmud Begarha of Gujarat had to 
come to the aid of the Muslims of southern Sind, who were said 
to have been persecuted by the Hindus. Mahmud’s mother was 
a daughter of Nanda, and Mahmud came to his grandfather’s aid 
in A.D. 1472, when it was reported that 40,000 rebels had risen 
against the latter. According to Firishta, these rebels were Shiah 
Baluchis, and according to the author of the Zafar-ul-Wdlih, they 
were pirates, skilled in archery, who lived on the sea coast owing 
allegiance to none. The rebels dispersed on hearing of Mahmud’s 
approach. Nanda sent Mahmud a letter of thanks with valuable 
gifts and his daughter, who was married to Qaisar Khan, the refugee 
prince of Khandesh, who was staying in Gujarat. 

Nanda died after a reign of 62 years, 13 and was succeeded by his 
son FIruz, but the real power passed into the hands of Darya Khan, 
the wazrr. A relation of FIruz, named Salah-ud-dln, attempted to 
seize the throne, but being unsuccessful fled to Gujarat to seek help 
from Sultan Muzaffar with whom he was related through marriage. 
Muzaffar gave Salah-ud-dln some help, and Darya Khan also joined 
him. FIruz fled away and Salah-ud-dln ascended the throne with¬ 
out any opposition. Later, however, Darya Khan changed sides, 
deposed Salah-ud-dln and restored FIruz. 

Salah-ud-dln again received help from Sultan Muzaffar of 
Gujarat and in 920 A.H. (A.D. 1514) once more turned FIruz out of 
Sind. FIruz then went to Shah Beg Arghun, with whose help he 
fought and killed Salah-ud-dln and his son and ascended the throne 
for the third time. But again he was dethroned. Shah Beg Arghun, 
who had been driven out of Qandahar by Babur, in his turn, 
expelled FIruz and occupied Sind. FIruz retired to Gujarat, and 
giving his daughter in marriage to Sultan Bahadur of Gujarat be-

MULTAN 


came one of his amirs. With the accession of Shah Beg, the rule 
of the Arghuns, a Mughui clan, began in Sind and their history 
will be related in the next volume. 

G. MULTAN 

Reference has been made above 1 to the Muslim kingdom of 
Multan and the strategy by which its rulers succeeded in averting 
the danger of conquest by the Pratlharas. Its subsequent history 
is obscure, but its ruler Shaikh Hamid Lodi maintained friendly 
relations with Amir Sabuktigin of Ghazni. But as Abu-’l Fath Daud, 
the grandson of Hamid, had adopted the heterodox doctrine of the 
Qarmatian sect, Sultan Mahmud, the great champion of orthodox 
Islam, determined to punish him. He led two expeditions against 
Multan in A.D. 1005-6 and 1010, and established his authority over 
that country. With the decline of the power of the Yaminis, Multan 
asserted independence, and again the Qarmatians seized power and 
held it till it was conquered by Mui‘zz-ud-din. After the death of 
Qutb-ud-din Aibak, Multan fell to the share of Nasir-ud-din Qabacha, 
who defended it successfully against a Mongol attack in A.D. 1227, 
but lost it to Iltutmish, as related above. 1a 

Multan was at this time the western frontier of the Delhi 
Sultanate, and had to bear the brunt of repeated Mongol attacks. 
The situation was further complicated by the marauding operations 
of Saif-ud-dln Hasan Qarlugh, an officer of Jalal-ud-dm Mangbarni, 
whom the latter had left in India. 

Situation changed rapidly after the death of Iltutmish. Hasan 
Qarlugh is said to have sent his son, Nasir-ud-din to Raziyya, but 
does not seem to have gained any diplomatic advantage. Imme¬ 
diately after the accession of Ma‘sud (A.D. 1242), Kablr Khan, the 
governor of Multan, rebelled and not only gained complete control 
over that province, but conquered Uch also. Ma‘sud was unable 
to dispossess him, and his (Kablr Khan’s) son, Abu Bakr, succeeded 
him shortly afterwards. 2 After Abu Bakr’s death, Hasan Qarlugh 
was able, after a series of attempts, to conquer Multan in A.D. 1245, 
whence he issued coins in the name of his master, Jalal-ud-dln 
Mangbarni. 3 

A Mongol invasion early in 1246, saved Multan for the 
Sultanate, for, with the approach of the Mongol army, Hasan 
Qarlugh fled from Multan to lower Sind. Ulugh Khan, later Sultan 
Ghiyas-ud-din Balban, drove the Mongols out of India, and occupied 
Uch and Multan without any opposition. Next year the Mongols 
again invaded India and besieged Multan, when the saint Shaikh 
Baha-ud-dm Zakariya induced them to leave on payment of 
1,00,000 dinars. 


227 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The repeated Mongol raids forced the Sultans of Delhi to send 
strong governors to Multan, and Balban sent his eldest son, 
Muhammad, as the governor there. Muhammad died in his post 
while repulsing a Mongol raid early in A.D. 1285. 4 This incident 
has been immortalized by the elegy written by the poet Amir 
Khusrav who was taken prisoner by the Mongols after the prince’s 
death but managed to escape soon after. However, in spite of the 
Mongol raids, Multan continued to be a province of the Delhi 
Sultanate. 

As has been related above, Timur, before leaving India, ap¬ 
pointed Khizr Khan the governor of Multan, which was thus in¬ 
cluded in the kingdom of the Sayyids. During the reign of Mubarak, 
successor of Khizr Khan, Amir Shaikh ‘All of Kabul seems to have 
invaded Multan more than once, but was forced to retire by 
Mubarak. 15 After the assassination of Mubarak, the affairs of the 
provinces fell into disorder, and either in A.D. 1434 or I486, 6 his 
successor Muhammad came to Multan to visit the tombs of the 
saints. 

“In A.H. 841 (A.D. 1437-8)”, states Nizam-ud-dln, “news was 
brought that owing to the turbulence of a band of Lankahs there 
was disturbance in Multan”. Multan, however, continued to acknow¬ 
ledge the suzerainty of Delhi till 847 A.H. (A.D. 1443-4), when there 
being no regular governor, 7 the people of Multan chose as their 
ruler Shaikh Yusuf Zakariya QuraishI, guardian of the tomb of the 
famous saint Baha-ud-dm Zakariya (A.D. 1182-1267), mentioned 
above. 73 

The Shaikh applied himself to the task of government but, 
before long, fell a victim to the wiles of Ray Sahrah, the chief of 
the Lankahs and ruler of Sewl and the surrounding territory. 8 
Sahrah beguiled the simple Shaikh by giving him his daughter in 
marriage, and then began to visit Multan regularly on the pretext 
of visiting his daughter. One night Sahrah introduced his followers 
into the city by a clever ruse, and expelling the Shaikh, seized the 
government of the country. Thus, after a rule of two years, Shaikh 
Yusuf had to leave Multan and seek shelter at Delhi. He was well 
received there and his son ‘Abdullah married the daughter of Buhlul 
Lodi. 

Sahrah became the king of Multan under the title of Qutb-ud- 
dln. He proved to be an able and good ruler, and the people, satis¬ 
fied with his government, rendered him willing allegiance. He died 
in A.D. 1460 after a reign of 16 years, and was succeeded by his son 
Husain. 


228 


MULTAN 


Husain also proved to be an able ruler. He conquered the 
fort of Shor (Shorkot, Jhang district, Punjab), and Kot Karor, and 
brought the country around it as far as the fort of Dhankot under 
his possession. Meanwhile, Shaikh Yusuf persuaded Buhlul Lodi 
to send an expedition against Multan under Buhlul’s third son, 
Barbak Shah, and Tatar Khan, the governor of the Punjab. As the 
invading army was marching towards Multan, Husain’s brother, 
who was the governor of Kot Karor, rebelled against him and 
assumed the title of Sultan Shihab-ud-dln. Husain first proceeded 
against his brother, reduced Kot Karor, and imprisoned Shihab-ud- 
dln. He then turned against Barbak Shah and Tatar Khan who had 
reached near the city of Multan, but had not yet been able to invest 
it. Husain crossed the Sindhu during night and entered the fort; 
the next morning he made a sally and the Delhi army fled after a 
brief encounter. 

On the death of Buhlul (A.D. 1489), Husain sent letters of 
condolence and congratulation to his successor Sikandar. This led 
to a treaty, by which the parties agreed to respect each other’s 
boundary. Husain also sent an embassy to Sultan Muzaffar of 
Gujarat, with whom he maintained friendly relations. 

During Husain’s reign, two nobles from Sind, Jam Bayazld and 
Jam Ibrahim, being forced to leave their country by Jam Nanda, 
came to Multan. Husain allotted to Jam Bayazld the fief of Shorkot 
and to Jam Ibrahim, Uch. 

When Husain became old, he placed his son Flruz on the throne 
and retired. The old wazir, Tmad-ul-Mulk Tawalak, continued in 
his office, but unfortunately, Flruz suspected the wazir’s son of dis¬ 
loyalty and had him murdered. To avenge his son’s death, Tawalak 
poisoned Flruz soon after, and Husain, stricken with grief, had to 
ascend the throne again, and take over the charge of administration. 
It was, however, impossible to forgive Tawalak, and with the help 
of Jam Bayazld, Husain had him arrested and executed. Bayazld 
then became the wazir, and received the guardianship of Mahmud, 
the son of Flruz. Shortly after, Sultan Husain died (August 31, 
1502) and was succeeded by Mahmud. 9 

Mahmud was a profligate young man, favouring low company; 
Jam Bayazld was provoked into open rebellion, and received help 
from Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of the Punjab. 9a The two 
armies encamped near the Ravi, but before any engagement took 
place, negotiations were started and settlement was effected on the 
basis of the river Ravi being recognized as the boundary between 
the territory of the two parties; that is, Bayazld got all the territory 
from Shorkot up to the Ravi. 10 


229 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


A few years after the conquest of Qandahar, Babur bestowed 
Multan and the adjoining territories on Shah Husain Beg Arghun 
of Sind, who thereupon invaded Multan. Mahmud sent emissaries 
to Shah Husain, but before anything could be effected, died of colic. 
It was suspected that he was poisoned by Langar Khan, one of his 
officers, who soon after joined Husain and helped him to subjugate 
several cities. 

Other nobles, however, remained true to the dynasty, and raised 
Mahmud’s infant son, Husain II, to the throne; but Mahmud’s 
son-in-law, Shuja‘-ul-Mulk Bukhari, became the wazir and the de 
facto ruler. Taking advantage of the situation, Shah Husain Arghun 
besieged Multan, which was bravely defended for more than a year. 
But at last food ran short, and the people suffered terrible priva¬ 
tions augmented by the misgovernment of the inept Bukhari and 
the follies of his trusted officers. Finally, in A.D. 1525 11 (932 A.H.), 
Shah Husain Arghun stormed the city, and all its residents from 
the age of seven to seventy, who escaped the sword, are said to have 
been taken into captivity as slaves. 

After a brief stay at Multan, Shah Husain Arghun left it in 
charge of one Khvaja Shams-u-dln with Langar Khan as his assis¬ 
tant. But soon Langar Khan managed to remove the Khvaja and 
took possession of Multan, where he was able to restore order to 
some extent. 

After the death of Babur, when the Punjab fell to the share 
of Kamran, he summoned Langar Khan to wait upon him. When 
Langar Khan came to Lahore, Kamran bestowed on him the terri¬ 
tory of Babal in exchange for Multan, which, thus, again became 
an appendage of Delhi. It passed into the hands of Sher Shah and, 
after the restoration of the Mughul power, became a Mughul 
province. 

H. SOUTH INDIA 

I. THE P ANDY A KINGDOM 
• • 

At the close of the thirteenth century A.D. Maravarman Kula- 
sekhara Pandya ruled over a rich, prosperous and extensive king¬ 
dom which included, besides the Pandya kingdom proper round 
about the capital city Madura, the greater part of the South Indian 
Peninsula. 1 As noted above, it was during the reign of ‘Ala-ud-dln 
Khalji that the Delhi Sultanate made the first attempt to conquer 
this Hindu kingdom in the far south, but the invasions of Malik 
Kafur 2 were more of the nature of plundering raids than serious 
attempts at annexation. The same may also be said of the later 
invasion under Khusrav. 3 These invasions resulted in the plunder 


230 


SOUTH INDIA 


of wealth and desecration of temples and images of Hindu gods, 
and inflicted untold miseries upon the people which are reflected 
in contemporary inscriptions. 4 

Unfortunately, at the time of the first Muslim invasion, the 
country was suffering from the inevitable effect of a war of succes¬ 
sion between two sons of Kulasekhara Pandya, namely, VIra Pandya 
and Sundara Padya. The position was rendered more serious by 
the fact that Sundara Pandya, defeated by his brother, sought the 
protection of the Muslim invader. This action of Sundara has been 
regarded by some as the direct cause of Kaffir’s invasion, but this 
may be doubted. The probability is that the Pandya prince did not 
go to Delhi court for help, as is generally believed, but fled to Malik 
Kaffir when he was actually in the south. 5 The extent to which he 
received any help from the Muslims is also uncertain. There is no 
positive evidence to support the view that Sundara was placed on 
the throne by Kaffir who left a garrison at Madura to protect him. 3 

In any case there remained no trace of Muslim influence in 
the Pandya country after the departure of Kaffir, and epigraphic 
evidence shows that the two Pandya brothers and their successors 
continued to rule over the country. 7 But the fratricidal war and 
the Muslim invasion had undermined the strength and solidarity 
of the Pandya ruling family and paved the way for the rise of new 
powers. The first to take advantage of the situation was Ravi- 
varman Kulasekhara, ruler of Kerala, whose territory had somehow 
or other escaped the invasion of Kaffir. He defeated both the 
Pandya rivals and established his authority over the Cholas and the 
Pandyas. Some time about A.D. 1312-13, he crowned himself on the 
banks of the Vegavatl, which has been identified by some with a 
river near Kanchl and bv others with the well-known river of that 
name in the Madura District. But Kulasekhara certainly advanced 
as far as Kanchl, and probably defeated another king named VIra 
Pandya who was forced to seek refuge in Konkan, and then in 
the forests. 8 

Soon, however, VIra Pandya managed to raise a force and seems 
to have gained the alliance of Hoysala VIra Ballala III and one 
VIra Udaya Marttandavarman; a rebellion also broke out in Kerala. 
The combination of these circumstances forced Ravivarman to retire 
from the northern part of Pandya empire, though he clung to its 
southern part for about two years more. 9 

But the unfortunate country was not destined to enjoy peace. 
Shortly afterwards, the Kakatlya Prataparudra sent an expedition 
under Muppidi Nayaka to invade the south. Faced with this cala¬ 
mity, the five Pandyas namely VIra, Sundara, Vikrama, Kulasekhara 


231 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


and Parakrama, joined their forces and faced the enemy in a battle 
just outside Kanchl. But Prataparudra, who had by this time joined 
his army, emerged victorious, captured Kahchi and placed it under 
his own governor. Vira Bandy a and Sundara Bandy a attempted to 
drive out their enemy, but were again defeated. 

The evils of the system of co-regents, namely, the joint rule of 
a number of members of the ruling family, also made themselves 
felt. At a time when the Pandyas could only be saved by a strong 
united opposition, internecine quarrels broke out among the co¬ 
regents, particularly between Vira Pandya and Parakrama Pandya 
in which the latter was joined by Vira’s son, Samudra Pandya. As 
usually happens, the feudal chiefs took advantage of the weakness 
and disunion of the central government to throw off their yoke. 
Kulasekhara, belonging to the family of the Sambuvarayas of North 
Arcot, who had been feudatories, successively, of the Cholas and 
the Pandyas, continued his allegiance to Vira Pandya till about 
A.D. 1317-8, and then declared his independence. Another feuda¬ 
tory, who also probably followed in his footsteps, was a member of 
the illustrious Chola Imperial family. He was Semapillai, the son 
of Rajendra III, who issued inscriptions in the old Pudukkottai 
State. 10 The invasion of Khusrav Khan 10a further hastened the 
process of disintegration. 

Though shorn of the empire the Pandyas continued to rule in 
South India. Sundara Pandya ruled till A.D. 1319, or probably 
1320, 11 while Vira Pandya issued inscriptions from the Ramnad 
district till A.D. 1341. 12 It was during the latter’s reign that the 
Muslims obtained a firm footing in South India; for, as noted above, 
during the reign of Sultan Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq, his son Ulugh 
Khan, the future Muhammad bin Tughluq, conquered Madura in 
A.D. 1323, and made it the headquarters of the Muslim province 
in this region, known in Muslim history as Ma‘bar. The history 
of Ma c bar will be dealt with in the next section of this chapter. 
But it is necessary to point out that the establishment of Ma‘bar did 
not mean the extinction of the Pandya rule, even in the neighbour¬ 
ing districts of Madura, Ramnad and Tanjore. Maravarman Kula¬ 
sekhara, probably the younger brother of Sundara Pandya mentioned 
above, is known to have ruled till A.D. 1346, and his epigraphic 
records prove that his rule extended to all the districts from 
Tinnevelly to Tanjore. Inscriptions of Jatavarman Parakrama 
Pandya, whose rule covered the period from A.D. 1315 to at least 
1347, are found in the Tinnevelly, Madura, Ramnad and Tanjore 
districts as well as in the old Pudukkottai State. One Maravarman 
Vira Pandya issued an inscription in the Ramnad district in A.D. 1364, 
the 31st year of his reign, and probably ruled till A.D. 1380. The 


232 


SOUTH INDIA 


records of another king, Maravarman Parakrama Pandya, who ruled 
from A.D. 1335 to 1352, are found in the districts of Ramnad, 
Tanjore, South Arcot and Chingleput. One Jatavarman Parakrama 
Pandya exercised authority in the Ramnad district, the old 
Pudukkottai State and as far as Nagercoi! in the southern extremity 
of the Peninsula from A.D. 1357 to 1380. 13 It would thus appear 
that the Muslim principality of Ma‘bar was a tiny State which could 
not oust the Pandyas from their homeland. The establishment of 
Muslim authority in this region was resisted not only by these 
Pandya rulers, but also by the Hoysala king VIra Ballala III. Ma‘bar 
thus led a precarious existence till it was finally swept away by the 
powerful Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagara in the third quarter of 
the fourteenth century A.D. But even after this the Pandyas conti¬ 
nued to rule, and we know the names of at least three rulers, two 
of whom bore the name Parakrama, and another, Jatavarman Kula- 
sekhara, who ruled respectively from 1367 to 1387, 1384 to 1415 
and 1395 to 1411. All their records were, however, found in the 
Tinnevelly district, and it seems that their authority was restricted 
to this region in the extreme south of their homeland. 14 

II. MA‘BAR 

The Tughluq Sultans of Delhi were not destined to enjoy for 
long their southernmost province of Ma‘bar. As mentioned above, 15 
a rebellion broke out in Ma‘bar in A.D. 1334 and Sultan Muhammad 
was unable to suppress it. Jalal-ud-dm Ahsan Shah, who headed 
this rebellion and established the independent Sultanate of Madura, 
was probably the kotwdl of Ma‘bar though Ibn Batutah, who had 
married his daughter, describes him as the governor of the 
province. 16 Jalal-ud-din could not reign in peace as the Hindus 
took advantage of his rebellion to liberate this region from the yoke 
of the Muslims. Ekambaranatha, one of the Sambuvarayas, mention¬ 
ed above, rose against the Muslim rulers and, with the help of Vira 
Ballala III and Kapaya Nayaka, wrested the northern parts of the 
country. 17 Ibn Batutah does not give any details of the reign of 
Jalal-ud-din, but merely says that he was killed after a reign of five 
years, and was succeeded by one of his amirs , namely, ‘Ala-ud-din 
’Udaiji. According to Ibn Batutah, ’Udaiji, after he had ruled for 
a year, set out on an expedition against the Hindus and returned 
with immense booty. Next year he again defeated the Hindus and 
“massacred very many of them”, but as he incautiously raised his 
helmet to drink water, was pierced by an arrow and died instantly. 18 
It may be presumed that the first two Sultans of Ma‘bar had to fight 
against the Hindu chiefs mentioned above as well as the Pandya 


283 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


rulers who, as noted above, exercised authority in various parts of 
South India, including territories adjacent to Madura. 

After the death of ’UdaijI his son-in-law, Qutb-ud-din, was 
raised to the throne, but was killed after a reign of forty days. 
Ghiyas-ud-dm Muhammad Shah Damaghani, a son-in-law of Jalal- 
ud-din Ahsan Shah, then ascended the throne. During his reign 
Ibn Batutah visited Ma‘bar and has left an eye witness’ account 
of the revolting man-hunt and mass execution practised by this 
ruler. The Sultan, Ibn Batutah relates, entered a jungle with his 
soldiers one night and all the Hindus who had taken shelter there 
were captured. Next morning all the male prisoners were impaled 
on stakes which they had been forced to carry the previous night. 
“This done, their women were slain along with their children, their 
hair being tied to the stakes; they were left there in the same 
condition. Afterwards, the camp was pitched and they took to cut¬ 
ting down the trees of another part of the forest, and they treated 
in the same manner the next batch of Kafirs (i.e. Hindus) whom 
they had captured. This was a hideous thing which I have never seen 
being indulged in by any king. On account of this, God hastened 
his death”. 19 

Probably such unheard of cruelties perpetrated on the Hindus, 
added to the general desire to liberate the country from the Muslims, 
spurred to action the Hoysala king, Vira Ballala III, then over 
eighty years of age. He invaded Ma‘bar and besieged Kannanur, 
one of the strongest forts held by the Muslims. Ibn Batutah has 
left a graphic account of the fight. The Muslim army met him in 
battle in the outskirts of the city of Konnanur, 20 but he routed 
them and they withdrew to Madura, leaving Ballala free to besiege 
Konnanur. After the siege had lasted for ten months, the garrison 
was left with little food, and Vira Ballala promised them safe-con¬ 
duct if they capitulated. The garrison then proposed that they 
should get permission from their Sultan and this was allowed by 
Ballala. But the messenger of the besieged army returned with 
reinforcement from Madura which fell upon the besieging army 
when it was off its guard. The Hoysala army was routed and its 
king taken prisoner. Damaghani at first treated Ballala kindly and 
wrested from him all his riches, elephants and horses promising 
to release him. But after he had stripped him of all his possessions, 
he killed and flayed him. Vira Ballala’s skin was then filled with 
straw and hung on the wall of Madura where Ibn Batutah saw it 
suspended. Shortly after, Ghiyas-ud-dm Damaghani died as a re¬ 
sult of taking an overdose of aphrodisiac. A few days earlier his 
only son and wife had died of cholera which was then raging in an 
epidemic form at Madura. 


234 


SOUTH INDIA 


Ghiyas-ud-din was succeeded by his nephew, Nasir-ud-din, who 
was once a domestic servant in Delhi. One of his first acts on com¬ 
ing to the throne was to murder his cousin, the son of his paternal 
aunt, and to marry his widow, the daughter of Ghiyas-ud-dm 
Damaghani. 

Ibn Batutah, whose account is the only source for a connected 
history of the Sultans of Ma‘bar, left the country shortly after the 
accession of Nasir-ud-din, and no definite information about the 
history of Ma‘bar subsequent to his departure is available. 

There is, however, no doubt that the royal dynasty came to 
an end during the next decade. When Firuz Tughluq ascended the 
throne he sent a farman to Ma‘bar. But instead of submitting to 
the authority of Delhi, Ma‘bar sought help from the BahmanI king 
to maintain her independence. Agents from Ma‘bar came to 
Daulatabad and took back with them Qurbat Hasan Gangu whom 
they placed on the throne. In some manuscripts of ‘Afif’s Tdrikh- 
i-FTruz Shahl, which alone mentions this episode, the first part of 
the name, Qurbat, is written as Qurba or Qarib; meaning ‘relative’; 
‘kinsman’, and it is thus quite likely that the newly elected king of 
Ma‘bar was not named Qurbat, but was a relative of Hasan Gangu 
Bahmani. Howsoever that may be, the new king was a worthless 
debauchee and the people got disgusted at his conduct. Taking 
advantage of this, a neighbouring chief, Bikan, invaded Ma‘bar with 
a large army. The king was captured and killed, and the whole 
of Ma‘bar came under the sway of Bikan. 21 

There is no doubt that ‘Afif here refers to the conquest of 
Ma‘bar by Bukka, the king of Vijayanagara, which will be described 
in Chapter XII. According to ‘Afif, Ma‘bar, at this great crisis, 
appealed to Firuz Tughluq for help. But the Sultan reminded the 
ambassadors of the past attitude of Ma‘bar towards the Delhi 
Sultanate and politely refused any help on the ground that his army 
was very tired after the expedition to Gujarat. This would indi¬ 
cate that the invasion of Ma‘bar by Vijayanagara army, resulting 
in the death of Qurbat Hasan Gangu and the conquest of his king¬ 
dom, took place not long after the Gujarat expedition of Firuz in 
A.D. 1363-4. 

Afif’s account is corroborated by other evidences. According 
to the Telugu Jaimini-Bharatam, a work of the late 15th century, 
Saluva Mangu, a general of Kumara Kampana, son of Bukka, who 
led the expedition against Ma‘bar, put to death the Sultan of 
Madura. The exploits of Kampana are also graphically, though 
somewhat romantically, described by his consort GahgadevI in her 
celebrated work, Madhumvijayam or Kampardyacliaritam. She 


235 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


proudly relates how her valiant husband killed the Sultan in a duel 
after the Muslim army had taken to flight. 

Afif’s statement that the whole of Ma £ bar was conquered and 
annexed by Vijayanagara, shortly after A.D. 1364, after the death 
of Qurbat Hasan Gangu, requires some modification in the light of 
numismatic evidence. We possess a series of coins issued by ‘Adil 
Shah, Fakhr-ud-dln Mubarak Shah, and £ Ala-ud-dm Sikandar Shah 
with dates ranging between A.D. 1356 and 1378. The testimony 
of these coins has been rejected on the ground that except for the 
fact that these coins were discovered in South India there is nothing 
to indicate that the Sultans mentioned in these coins ruled over 
Ma £ bar. 22 But the sequence of dates in the series of coins, their 
find-spots and the absence of any other Muslim dynasty ruling in 
this region about that time certainly favour the theory that the 
coins were issued by the rulers of Ma‘bar. If we accept this view 
we may easily identify Qurbat Hasan Gangu with Fakhr-ud-dln 
Mubarak Shah w 7 hose coins cover the entire period from 760 A.H. 
to 770 A.H., year by year, with the exception of years 762 and 
766 A.H. 23 It would thus appear that he certainly ruled between 
A.D. 1358-9 to 1368-9. This fits in fairly well with what £ Afif says 
about Qurbat Hasan Gangu and also with the Vijayanagara sources. 
There is some apparent conflict between the testimony of coins men¬ 
tioned above and the general assumption of the historians of Vijaya¬ 
nagara that Ma‘bar was annexed after the campaign of 1370. This 
view is supported, among others, by the statement in the Madu~ 
raittala Varaldru, a fifteenth century chronicle of Madura, that the 
place was under Muslim sway from A.D. 1324 to 1371. 24 But this 
is not irreconcilable with the issue of the coins by £ Ala-ud-dm 
Sikandar Shah in 779 A.H. (A.D. 1377-8). It merely indicates that 
even after the loss of the major part of their dominions, some time 
about A.D. 1370, the Muslim Sultans continued their resistance for 
about a decade more. The very fact that Ma £ bar sent for help to 
FIruz Tughluq even after the death of Qurbat Hasan Gangu and the 
conquest of Ma £ bar by Vijayanagara, proves that some sort of resist¬ 
ance was still continued by another Sultan. 

It should be noted in this connection that the date of Kam¬ 
il ana’s expedition or more probably a series of expeditions against 
Ma £ bar is not definitely known. Some scholars have placed them 
during the interval between A.D. 1343 and 1355-6, 26 while others 
concluded that Kampana’s expedition took place after A.D. 1378; 28 
it has also been suggested that Kampana led his expeditions bet¬ 
ween A.D. 1361-3 or about A.D. 1364. 27 

While it is not possible to arrive at a definite conclusion on 
this point, it has to be admitted that there are indications that 


236 


SOUTH INDIA 


Kampana gained his famous victory over the Ma‘bar Sultans in 
A.D. 1370. 28 In an inscription, dated A.D. 1371, Kampana’s gene¬ 
ral Goppana claims to have slain the Tulushkas, and two inscriptions 
show Kampana ruling a portion of Ramnad district in A.D. 1371 
and 1374. 29 

It is, however, possible that Kampana’s victory was the culmi¬ 
nation of a war which was started by his grandfather, Sahgama. An 
inscription claims that Sahgama, the father of Bukka, had defeated 

“. Pandya, the proud lord of Madhura the fierce valorous 

Turushka, the king Gajapati and others.” Even after due allowance 
is made for the exaggerations from which this type of literature 
is never free, it is evident that Sahgama gained some success 
against the Sultans of Ma‘bar, and it is possible that he took up 
arms after the tragic death of Ballala III. 30 

It would thus appear that ever since the foundation of the 
Sultanate of Madura, it had to carry on a prolonged fight with the 
neighbouring Hindu States. The second Sultan died in course of a 
battle against them. Next, Ylra Ballala made a gallant attempt to 
conquer Ma'bar but failed. It is probable that Sahgama had started 
the war against the Sultan and gained some notable success. 
Ultimately his grandson Kampana took up his unfinished task and 
destroyed the power of the Sultanate of Ma‘bar. Though Kampana 
had probably broken the back of the Muslim power in the south by 
A.D. 1370, or even a little earlier, the last Sultans seem to have main¬ 
tained a feeble struggle against Vijayanagara till A.D. 1377-8. 31

that date assumed the royal title (Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey

B. KHANDESH 

1. Thalner, 75° V E., 22° 21’ N., Kuronde, 73° 28’ E., 21° 18’ N. According to Sir 
Denison Ross, the name of the founder of the principality of Khandesh was 
Malik Ahmad, who was called Malik Raja and Raja Ahmad. Having joined 
Bahram Khan Mazandaram in his unsuccessful rebellion against the Bahmani 
king, Malik Ahmad fled and established himself at Thalner (CHI, III, 294). But 
Sir Denison has not given any reference for this version, and I have not been 
able to find any. Dr. H. K. Sherwani, also, has not been able to verify this 
statement (The Bahmanis of the Deccan, p. 109, f.n. 55). I have, therefore, 
followed the version of Firishta (Briggs, IV. 280-327) which has been followed 
by later writers and gives the most detailed account of the origin of Khandesh 
as an independent State. 

[According to the Ain-i-Akbari, Malik Raja fell on evil days when he was 
in Bldar. So it is likely that he began his career there. In the account of the 
rebellion of Bahram Khan the name of Malik Raja does occur, but there were 
two contemporary noblemen bearing the name Ahmad, and it is quite likely 
that Ross confused one of them with Malik Raja. I am indebted for this in¬ 
formation to Prof. Abdur Rashid.—Ed.] 

2. According to Firishta (Briggs, IV. 283) the name of Malik Raja’s younger son 
was Iftikhar. Ross gives the name as Hasan (CHI, III. 296). 

3. Firishta (Briggs, IV. 298). Ross writes that ‘Adil Khan II “carried his arms 
as far as Jharkhand, the modern Chota Nagpur, from which circumstance he is 
known as Jharkhandi Sultan ” (CHI, III. 313). As usual, Ross does not reveal 
his source, and it is not possible to check this statement. It is, therefore, safer 
to follow Firishta. 

4. Firishta gives the date of his death as Rabi-ul-Awal 14, 909 A.H. which falls in 
A.D. 1503. Ross gives the date as A.D. 1501 (CHI, III. 313). There is similar 
discrepancy of two years in the reign-period of his successor. 

5. Sir E. Denison Ross, possibly following the Mii~’dt-i-Ahmadi, has referred to 
‘Adil Khan III as Alam Khan and states that after coming to the throne he 
assumed the title of ‘Adil Khan (CHI, III. 313-314). This is, however, at 
variance with Firishta (Briggs, IV, 303-4) and Nizam-ud-dln (TA, III. i, 282). 

6. Nizam-ud-dln refers to MIran Muhammad as ‘Adil Khan (TA, III, i, 344) but 
this seems to be a mistake. 


C. MALWA 

1. According to Sir W. Haig, “Dilavar Khan never assumed the style of royalty” 
(CHI, III, 349). But both Nizam-ud-dln (TA, III, ii, 468) and Firishta 
(Briggs, TV, 169-70) definitely state that Dilavar declared his independence and 
assumed the paraphernalia of sovereignty. 

2. For a discussion of this date see Nizam-ud-dln, op. cit. 467, f.n. 6. 

3. This victory of Allada is referred to in several contemporary works and in¬ 
scriptions. For detailed reference and discussion see N. Venkataramanayya: 
The Gajapati Bhanudeva IV, PIHC, XIII (1950), 161. The Muslim historians 
do not refer to this incident.

5. For this lake see Imperial Gazetteer, VIII, p. 121. Bhojpur is situated in 28° 6' 
N., and 70° 38' E. Sir W. Haig, following Briggs, describes the Hindus as 
robbers and does not mention the destruction of the lake. He adds that after 
this Hushang built the town of Hushangabad. But there seems to be no autho¬ 
rity for this statement. 

6. As regards the date of Muhammad Shah’s death and that of Mahmud Khaljl’s 
accession, there is a conflict between the numismatic evidence which places 
both in 840 A.H. (A.D. 1436-7) and the account of the contemporary writer, 
Shihab-i-Hakim, according to whom Mahmud ascended the throne on 29 Shaw- 
wal 839 (May 16, 1436). However, Muhammad Shah’s gold coin, bearing the 
date 840 A.H. to which Wright has referred, appears to be a posthumous one 
which was presumably issued by the supporters of the Ghurld line to which 
Muhammad Shah and his two predecessors belonged. Wright has similarly 
catalogued three coins of Mahmud Khaljl I with the dates 877, 878 and 883 A.H. 
although Mahmud died in 873 A.H. The practice of issuing posthumous coins 
was also repeated in the case of Husain Sharql who died in 905 A.H., but coins 
issued in his name in 906, 907, 909 and 910 are available. 

Wright has probably not consulted the contemporary work Ma‘asir-i- 
Mahmud Shahi the evidence of which ought to be considered reliable with 
regard to the rise to power of Mahmud Khaljl who was its author’s patron.

7. In CHI, III. 354, the city is called “Shahr-i-Nau” and it is stated that it is not 
now traceable. Though in some MSS. the place is called “Shahr-i-Nau”, in 
one MS of TA, it is called “Shahr-i-Narwar”, and Briggs calls it Narwar, in 
his translation of Firishta (IV, p. 205). Narwar is a well-known place, and it 
is situated on the river Sind, about 50 miles to the SSW. of Gwalior.

8. Ranapura Temple Inscription, 11, 17 and 26. Prakrit and Sanskrit Inscriptions

defeated and captured Sultan Mahmud in 1437 (H.B. Sarda Maharana Kumbha 
p. 51). But the evidence for such a conclusion does not appear to be convincing. 

9. “One large figure (image) in particular, representing a ram, and formed of solid 
marble, being consumed, the Rajputs were compelled to eat the calcined parts 
with pan, in order that it might be said that they were made to eat their gods” 
(Briggs, Tr. of Firishta, IV, 209). Nizam-ud-dln also relates the same incident. 
(TA, III, ii. 513-14). 

10. TA, III, ii, p. 525. The reading of Ajmere is doubtful. Elsewhere Nizam-ud-dln 
writes Ambar, (TA, III, 232). 

11. The Kumbhalgarh inscription (quoted by H. B. Sarda, Maharana Kumbha, p. 84) 
states that Kumbha “vanquished the Haras and received a tribute from them.” 

12. CHI, III. 361. 

13. Sir Wolseley Haig does not mention this battle at all though it is corrobo¬ 
rated by Firishta, and has been rightly criticised by Dr. B. Prasad (TA, III, 
ii, p. 529-30 f.n.). Firishta’s statement that Kumbha concluded peace by 
paying a large amount in gold and specie, when compared with Nizam-ud-dln’s 
version, shows what little value is to be placed on such accounts of repeated suc¬ 
cesses and victories of Muslims against a particular Hindu kingdom without any 
tangible result. The contemporary Rajput inscriptions, claiming success against 
the Muslim invaders, is deserving of at least as much credit as the later Muslim 
chronicles, and there is no good ground to believe the latter and reject the 
former, as is usually done by European historians. 

14. According to Sir Wolseley Haig, Nizam-ul-Mulk Ghurl was assassinated by the 
BahmanI king Humayun Shah, whereupon his relatives induced Mahmud to 
invade the Deccan. But both Nizam-ud-dln and Firishta state that the instiga¬ 
tor was Nizam-ul-Mulk Ghurl himself. Tabataba merely says “at the instiga¬ 
tion of the Ghurls” (BK, 90). 

15. According to Tabataba the districts of Ahmedabad and Mahur were retained by 
the Bahmanls and only Kherla was ceded to Malwa (BK. 100). Sir W. Haig 
writes that under the treaty “Mahmud’s possession of Kherla was confirmed but 
the integrtiy of Berar, with that exception, was maintained.” (CHI, III, 359). 
But Nizkm-ud-dm states that Berar as far as Ellichpur was ceded to Malwa 
(TA, 538).

16. The name is Shaikh Muhammad Far mail in the MSS. of the TA and in the litho¬ 
graph edition of Firishta, but the lithograph edition of TA. and the CHI . 
(III. 360) have Shaikhzada Muhammad Qarmali. 

17. According to both Nizam-ud-din and Firishta, Mahmud died on Ziqiadah 10, 
873 which is May 26, 1489. Sir W- Haig, without giving any reference, writes 
that Mahmud died on June 1, 1469. For the date of Mahmud’s death, see n. 9 
under D. Jaunpur.

This is corroborated by the unpublished Raima! Raso quoted by H. B- Sarda 
( Maharana: Sdnga, p. 60) who describes the genesis of the quarrel. 

19. According to Nizam-ud-dln (TA, III, 353 and 612) the fort fell on 9th Sha‘ban, 
937 A.H. The year 937 A.H. corresponds to A.D. 1530-31 so that it cannot be 
A.D. 1528 as given in (the translation of) the TA.

135, 157).

The date of Husain Sharqi’s first major attack on Delhi is disputed. Nizam- 
ud-din has mentioned the year 1473, but he also says that Buhlul simultaneously 
sent appeals for help to Mahmud Khaljl of Malwa, notwithstanding the fact 
that Mahmud I had died four years earlier ( Tabaqat-i-Akbari . Vol. Ill, p. 284). 

Haig, in an attempt to correct Nizam-ud-din, writes that Buhlul sent his 
agents to Mahmud II of Malwa who, however, ascended the throne in 1511, 
about 22 years after Buhlul’s death. (CHI, III, pp. 231). 

‘Abdul Haqq writes that it was during the progress of Husain’s invasion of 
Delhi that Mahmud Khalji I of Malwa died (May 3 1469). The invasion had, 
therefore, been launched probably some time between March and May 1469- 
(This discussion of the date of Husain Sharqi’s attack on Delhi is by Dr. Hamid- 
ud-din.—Ed.).

as to justify the pious Sultan’s unprovoked attack on another Muslim State.” 
HBS, 84 (Ed.). 

7. According to the Riydz, Qadr Khan was appointed governor of Lakhnawati 
after the death of Nasir-ud-din Ibrahim. But the contemporary ‘Isaml says that the 
latter accompanied Muhammad Tughluq in his expedition against Kishlu Khan, 
which did not take place before 728 A.H. (A.D. 1327-8). (Ed.).

9. Thomas read the date of a coin of Fakhr-ud-din as 737 A.H. and therefore

THE SUCCESSION STATES OF THE DELHI SULTANATE 


placed the death of Bahram Khan in that year. Nelson Wright places the revolt 
of Fakhr-ud-dln in or about A.D. 1338 (739 A.H.). The death of Bahram Khan 
is given in HBS as 738 A.H. in one place (p. 89), and 739 in another (p. 98). (Ed.). 

10. According to ‘Aflf, Ilyas Shall defeated and killed Fakhr-ud-dln after the first 
invasion of Bengal by Sultan Firuz and conquered Sonargaon. He makes no 
reference to Fakhr-ud-din’s son and successor (HIED, III, 304). According to 
the Tdrikh-i-Mubarak Shahl, Muhammad Tughluq invaded Bengal in 741 A.H. 
(A.D. 1340-1) and killed Fakhr-ud-dln. Both these statements are proved to 
be wrong by the fact that Fakhr-ud-din issued coins till 750 A.H. and Xkhtiyar- 
ud-din GhazI Shah issued coins from Sonargaon in 750 and 753 A.H. The latter 
was probably the son of the former though there is no definite proof of this. 
(Ed.).

11. The date usually assigned to Shams-ud-dm Ilyas Shah, namely 743-758 A.H., 
has been given up, as a closer examination of his coins in the Indian Museum 
corroborates Mr. Shams-ud-dm Ahmad’s reading of the dates 740 and 780- 
The reign of Ilyas Shah therefore covers the period A.D- 1339 to 1358-9 (vide 
the Supplementary Catalogue by Shams-ud-dm Ahmad to Vol. II of the Cata¬ 
logue of Coins in the Indian Museum). 

12. As noted above, ‘Izz-ud-dln Yahya, the governor of Satgaon, in south Bengal, 
joined the governors of Kara and Lakhnawati in an expedition against Fakhr- 
ud-dln of Sonargaon in A.D. 1330. But after this Yahya passes from our 
view. According to Ibn Batutah, Fakhr-ud-din fitted out ships from the port 
of Sadkawan in his campaign against Lakhnawatl ( 1BH , 235 ff.). Sadkawan has 
been identified by some with Satgaon and by others with Chittagong (for the 
controversy cf. HBS, 100, f.n. 1). In case we accept the first identification we 
must presume that Fakhr-ud-dln succeeded in annexing south Bengal and this 
view r is supported by the fact that nothing more is heard of Yahya. On the other 
hand, as ‘Ala-ud-din ‘All Shah of Lakhnawatl issued coins tili 743 A.H. (A.D- 
1342), and Fakhr-ud-din’s successor ruled in Sonargaon till A.D. 1352, it is most 
reasonable to hold that Ilyas Shah established his power in Satgaon in 740 A H. 
(AD- 1339-40), the earliest date found on the coins issued by him. (Ed.). 

13. For full details cf. Ch. XIIX-D, III, 

14. According to Baranl, whose view has been adopted by later writers, Firuz left 
Delhi on 10 Shawal, 754 A.H. (November 8, 1353) and returned to Delhi on 12 
Shaban 755 A.H. (September 1, 1354). But the detailed accounts of Firuz’s 
march, given by ‘Aflf, makes it difficult to believe that the whole military 
operation lasted only ten months. Accordingly it has been held by some that 
Firuz spent about two years in this campaign (HBS, 105-6). ‘Aflf alone gives 
full details of both the campaigns of Firuz against Bengal, but his account is 
obviously of a partisan character, and he tries to gloss over the discomfiture of 
his patron and assigns specious grounds for discomfiture as will be noted 
below. (Ed).

18. ‘Aflf says that. Zafar Khan was received with extraordinary honours- “On 
the first day he received 30.000 tankas to get his clothes washed. His title, 
Zafar Khan, was confirmed and a sum of 4 lacs of tankas granted to him and 
his friends. One thousand horses and large numbers of footmen were assigned 
to him. He was first appointed deputy-roaHr, and subsequently became wazlr”. 
‘Aflf distinctly says that Sultan Firuz undertook the expedition to Bengal “for 
avenging the claims of Zafar Khan”. ‘Aflf further adds that preparations for 

241 


D.S.—16. 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


this campaign were began even during the lifetime of Ilyas, who out of fear, 
retreated to Sonargaon, and then we are told that “the inhabitants of that place 
were instant (sic) in their supplications to Sultan Firoz Shah for relief from 
. the tyrant”; (HIED, III. 304-5). (Ed.). 

19. HIED, III. 308. As mentioned above, the same motive, according to ‘Afif, per¬ 
suaded Firuz not to storm the citadel of Ekdala in the first expedition (Ibid. 
296-7). It could not have been unknown to Firuz that the ignominy of Muslim 
women was an inevitable consequence of military campaigns, and if therefore 
this consideration weighed with him in not pressing the campaign to a victo¬ 
rious conclusion, he should not have undertaken the campaign at all. At least 
after his experience of the first campaign, he should not have undertaken the 
second. The same argument applies to the aversion of Firuz to the annexation 
of Bengal, as mentioned by ‘Afif. (Ed.). 

20. If the argument advanced by Zafar was sincere, why, one might pertinently 
ask, was the campaign undertaken at all? What about avenging the claims of 
Zafar Khan, which, according to ‘Afif, was the sole motive of Firuz in under¬ 
taking this campaign? (Ed.).

21. The extreme known dates on Sikandar's coins are 758 and 792, and A‘zam Shah’s 

earliest coin bears the date 793 (A.H. which commenced on 9-12-1390 A.D.). 
A‘zam Shah therefore probably ascended the throne in 1391 A.D. The date 
of A‘zam Shah’s accession is given as A.D. 1389, and again some time between 
793 and 795 A.H. (A.D. 1390 and 1393) in HBS, pp. 114 and 116. (Ed.). 

22. The accounts of Mahuan and other Chinese envoys of this period have been 
translated by Dr. P. C. Bagchi in the Visvabharati Annals, I. 101 ff. 

23. This was the theory of Dr. Bagchi (op, cit. 108-9). He held that while Ghiyas- 
ud-dln (died A.D. 1411) and his son Saif-ud-dln (A.D. 1412-21) ruled in one 
part of the kingdom, Shihab-ud-dln (A.D. 1409-14) and Jalal-ud-dln (1414-31) 
ruled in another part. He further identified Shihab-ud-dln with Raja Ganesa, 
to whom reference will be made later. 

24. These have been very fully discussed, with reference to authorities, by Dr. A. H. 
Dani in JRASBL XVIII (1952), 121 ft. and by Sukhamay Mukhopadhyaya in 
his Bengali Book Bdhglar Itihdser duso vachhar (1956). The earlier discussion 
of the subject cf. The Coins and Chronology of the Independent Sidtans of 
Bengal by N. K. Bhattasali, and HBS, 120 ff.

7. This leads to a difficulty because, according to Mir Ma'sum, after the death of 
Singhar in A.D. 1007, his wife ascended the throne and then followed a strife 
at the end of which Pithu became king. But this difficulty is not insurmount¬ 
able, for either Hamun, the queen of Singhar, or Pithu—whose regnal periods 
are not mentioned—might have enjoyed long reigns or the internal strife lasted 
for a very long time, so that it is not improbable for Pithadeva to have been 
on the throne during the early years of the reign of Bhima II.

9. Practically no two accounts of the Samma dynasty agree among themselves, 
although the differences are not great. The reason for this discrepancy is that 
with the exception of Nizam-ud-dm none of our authorities were able to find 
a written history of Sind following the death of bin Qasim. We have there¬ 
fore followed Nizam-ud-dln’s version (TA, III, 773 ff.).

5. At least up to A.D. 1422 ‘Ala-ul-Mulk was the governor of Multan. In that 
year news came that Shaikh ‘All was preparing an invasion, whereupon Muba¬ 
rak Shah removed ‘Ala-ul-Mulk and appointed Malik Mahmud Hasan as gover¬ 
nor of Multan. (TA. I, 305). In A.D. 1426, Malik Mahmud Hasan was 
transferred and Malik Rajab Nadira sent to Multan (ibid, 308). Malik Rajab 
Nadira died in 1428 after which Mubarak again sent Malik Mahmud Hasan to 
Multan conferring on him the title of ‘Imad-ul-Mulik (ibid, 311). In 1431, he 
was removed from Multan and Malik Khair-ud-dm KhanI received Multan as 
his fief. Commenting on this Yahya bin Ahmad states: “But this act of trans¬ 
fer was imprudent and inconsiderate, as some insurrection broke out in Multan, 
an account of which will be given in the following pages” (TMB, 231). But 
no account of insurrection is given. Shaikh ‘All came in A.D. 1431, to help 
Pulad at the latter’s request. This time Shaikh ‘All was defeated near Multan 
and forced to turn back, but the governorship of Multan was transferred from 
‘Imad-ul-Mulk to Khair-ud-dln (ibid. 315). Soon after Sheikha Khokhar start- 


243 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ed his operations and beseiged Lahore, and taking advantage of the situation 
Shaikh ‘All advanced and captured Talambah (on the left bank of Ravi, 52 miles 
north-east of Multan, identified as Malli conquered by Alexander, where he 
crossed the R'avi; ibid, 313, f. n. 3; 316). This time Mubarak Shah advanced 
and Shaikh ‘All fled to Kabul. 

6. According to Nizam-ud-din, 838 A.H. (A.D. 1434 TA, I. 326). According to 
Firishta (Briggs) 840 A.H. (A.D. 1436), I. 536- 

7. Briggs, IV. 380. Firishta probably means that the Governor was not appointed 
by the Sultan of Delhi. 

7a. According to some authorities,. Shaikh Yusuf was never appointed governor of 
Multan, and it was conquered, not by Qutb-ud-din, but by his father, Budhan 
Khan SindhI, chief of the Lankah tribe, in A.D. 1437. (See Appendix A at 
the end of this chapter.) 

8. I have adopted the spelling of the proper names as found in the TA, which 
differs from those found in the CHI. 

9. The date of Sultan Husain’s death is doubtful; even Nizam-ud-din (TA, III, ii, 
80) could not ascertain the date definitely. But the reading 980 A.H. accepted 
in the translation of the TA, is impossible, as, according to Nizam-ud-din, 
Husain succeeded his father in 865 A.H.; neither is 940 A.H. likely. I have 
therefore accepted the reading 908 A.H. found in the lithograph ed. of the TA 
and followed by Sir Wolseley Haig (CHI, III, 504). Firishta (Briggs, IV, 391) 
also gives the year of Husain’s death as 908 A.H. 

9a. Jam Bayazid acknowledged allegiance to Sikandar Lodi, who thereupon sent 
him help. Am (text), I, 555, Tanqlh-ul-Akhbdr, I.O. MS. f. 233b, Mir’at-i-Jahdn

10. TA, III, ii, 803; Firishta (Briggs), IV, 395. 

11. According to Sir Wolseley Haig, Multan fell to Husain Arghun in A.D. 1528, 
but both Nizam-ud-din and Firishta (op. cit.) quote one Maulana, Sa‘dullah 
Lahori, who was at Multan during its fall and states that it fell in 932 A.H. 
(A.D. 1525). Nizam-ud-din, makes it clear that Babur “took possession of the 
Punjab in the year 930 A.H. and marched towards Delhi,” that is, before the 
battle of Panipat. It is known that after conquering Lahore, Babur instructed 
his generals to help ‘Alam Khan in his projected attack on Delhi which never 
took place. Probably Nizam-ud-din is referring to this abortive invasion. 
Babur is most unlikely to have bestowed Multan to the Arghuns after the battle 
of Panipat. (But Dr. Hamidud Din points out that according to the Tanqlh-ul - 
Akhbar, I.O. MS. f. 2331, Ain (text) I, 555, Muntdkhab, Hasan Khaki, Eton 
MS. f. 158b, Ma’dsir-i-Rahlml, I, 283, Shah Husain Arghun captured Multan

son was left to safeguard the interests of Kulasekhara is not clearly stated, but 
seems quite likely” (Kulasekhara is obviously a slip for Sundara Pandya). 
K. A. N. Sastri, however, observes that our authorities “do not suggest that 
Malik Kafur’s invasion of Ma‘bar was either caused by these differences (between 
the two brothers) or undertaken in the interest of one of the parties and on 
an appeal from him.... There is thus no reason to suppose that Sundara 
Pandya was restored to the throne of Madura and that a Muhammadan garri¬ 
son was left behind in the city for his protection” (op. cit. 207-8).

another contemporary writer, definitely asserts that Jalal-ud-dm was the 
kotwal of Madura and that he usurped the government of the province after 
murdering the officers who were in charge of the administration (Futuh-us- 
Salatin, p. 449). This is also partially corroborated by Yahya (N. Venkataram- 
anayya, The Early Muslim Expansion in South India, 123, f.n. 50). In judging 
the comparative value of the evidence respectively of Ibn Batutah and ‘Isami, 
we must make due allowance for the natural desire or tendency of the former 
to exaggerate the importance and status of one whose daughter he had married.

19. IBH. 227-8. In the passage quoted, Ibn Batutah has referred to the persecuted 
people as Kuffdr (plural of Kafir) which Dr. Husain has translated as ‘enemy’. 
But as Ibn Batutah does not refer to any battle or any hostile action, it is 
not easy to understand why the normal meaning of Kafir should not be ac¬ 
cepted here. Dr. Husain, also, has not assigned any reason for interpreting 
it differently. It therefore seems preferable to follow Defremery and San- 
guinetti’s translation where the word kafir has been translated as ‘Plindub 
(Voyages DTbn Batutah, Text and translation by C. Defremery and B. R. 
Sanguinetti Paris, 1922, IV, 192). There is no doubt that Ghiyas-ud-din 
DamaghanI was hunting out peaceful people who might have taken shelter 
in the forest to escape from his clutches. Therefore, to describe them as 
enemies seems inappropriate. Hence I have taken the word Kafir used by 
Ibn Batutah in its normal sense to mean the Hindus. It seems that Gangadevi 
refers to this inhuman act when, lamenting on the condition of Madura after 
Muslim occupation, she writes: “I very much lament for what has happened 
to the groves in Madhura. The cocoanut trees have all been cut and in their 
places are to be seen rows of iron spikes with human skulls dangling at the

Appendix to Chapter X 


THE ORIGIN OF THE LANKAHS 

Some of the well known writers, including Nizam-ud-dln, ‘Abbas 
Sarwani and Mir Ma‘sum, hold the view that the Lankah dynasty 
of Multan was founded by one Rai Sahra who hailed from Rapri 
(Rapar in Mailse tahsil of Multan) or Sewi (modern Sibbi near 
Quetta) and overthrew Shaikh Yusuf QuraishI whom the people of 
Multan had raised to power in the reign of the Sayyid Sultan, 
‘Ala-ud-dm ‘Alam Shah. [The date stated by them is A.H. 847 
(A.D. 1443) although ‘Alam Shah succeeded his father Muhammad 
Shah in A.H. 849 (A.D. 1445). See above p. 137 n. 28]. They give, 
however, divergent and often conflicting accounts of the various 
Lankah rulers as well as of their chronology and this renders their 
statements incredible (TA, III, 522, Tuhja-yi-Akbar ShahT, Camb. 
MS. fol. 2., Tdrlkh-i-Sind by Ma'sum, ed. Da’udpota, 148). 

However, before ousting Shaikh Yusuf QuraishI from Multan 
in A.H. 849 (A.D. 1445) Rai Sahra, according to the TA and the 
Tdrlkh-i-Sind, had held discussions with the Shaikh during which 
it was revealed that Buhlul had by then occupied Delhi, an event 
which actually took place in A.H. 855/A.D. 1451. This would also 
contradict the other statement that Shaikh Yusuf went to Delhi to 
seek Buhlul’s help in recovering Multan. CHI (III, 503) has also 
ignored the date of Buhlul’s accession while stating that Shaikh 
Yusuf was banished in A.D. 1440 to Delhi where he was well 
received by Buhlul. Rai Sahra, who had assumed the title of Sultan 
Qutb--ud-dln, died, according to the TA, in A.H. 865 (A.D. 1460) after 
a reign of 16 years. In Firishta (II, 628) and the Mafdsir-i-Rahimi 
(I, 268) the date of his death is given as A.H. 874 (A.D. 1469), but 
the account of the latter is confused as it agrees simultaneously with 
the TA in respect of the date of Rai Sahra’s accession as well as the 
duration of his reign. 

A further probe into the question, however, discredits the view 
that Shaikh Yusuf QuraishI ever became the ruler of Multan. The 
statement of the TA and the Tdrikh-i-Sind that the affairs of Mul¬ 
tan were neglected during the latter part of the Sayyid period and 
that in the absence of a duly appointed governor, the people chose 
Shaikh Yusuf QuraishI as their ruler, is belied by the contemporary 
account of the TM (231) according to which Sultan Mubarak Shah 
went to Multan in A.H. 836 (A.D. 1432) about 9 months before his 
death. It was probably during this visit that he bestowed the 
governorship of Multan on Khan-i-Khanan whom the Tdnkh-i-Haqql 
has described as his brother. Again, Sultan Muhammad Shah set 
out for Multan in A.H. 838 (A.D. 1434) (TM, 243) and is believed to 
have confirmed Khan-i-Khanan in his appointment. Three years 
later, in A.H. 841 (A.D. 1437), Budhan Khan SindhI, chief of the 
tribe of Lankahs, marched from Uchh, and after overthrowing Khan- 

246 


THE ORIGIN OF THE LANKAHS 


i-Khanan established himself as Sultan Mahmud Shah. He reigned 
for 17 years, and in A.H. 858 (A.B. 1454) was succeeded by his 
son, Qutb-ud-dm, whose reign lasted 16 years till A.H. 874 (A.D. 
1469). The latter was followed by Sultan Husain Lankah who occu¬ 
pied the throne of Multan for three decades. This account, which ap¬ 
pears to be most acceptable, is given in the Tdnkh-i-Haqql (Camb. 
MS. pp. 128-9) and is supported by Nur-ul-Haq’s Zubdat-ut-Twankh 
Lindesiana MS. fol. 257. Through the copyist’s error, the date of Mah¬ 
mud Shah Lankah’s death is written as A.H. 850 (A.D. 1446) al¬ 
though the length of his reign is correctly described as 17 years). 
Abu-’l Fazl has also corroborated the account of the Tdrlkh-i-Haqql 
from the accession of Mahmud Shah Lankah onwards, but his earlier 
references to Rai Sahra and Shaikh Yusuf Quraishi are incorrect. 
( Am-i-Akbarl, text I, 554. See also M.ujmal-i-Mujassal A.S.B. Cal¬ 
cutta MS. fol. 215b wherein the account of the TA. as well as of 
Tdrlkh-i-Haqqi is reproduced.) 

It will be seen, therefore, that Qutb-ud-dln was the second 
Lankah ruler and not the first one as described by Nizam-ud- 
dln, Mir Ma’sum and even by Firishta who otherwise correctly assigns 
to him a reign of 16 years ending in A.H. 874 (A.D. 1469). It may also 
be observed that Rai Sahra is rather an unusual name and the prefix, 
Rai, suggestes a Rajput origin whereas the Lankahs, according to 
Firishta, were Afghans. 

The error into which Nizam-ud-dln, Mir Ma’sum and some other 
writers have fallen, is probably due to the fact that Buhlul gave his 
daughter in marriage to Shaikh Abdullah, son of Shaikh Yusuf 
Quraishi. This has apparently led these writers to assign to the 
Shaikh a political role as well. There is no doubt that Buhlul as a 
pious Muslim held in great esteem the Muslim saints (see above 
p. 152 n. 9d.) and he must have gladly married his daughter to the 
son of Shaikh Yusuf who happened to be a descendant of the renown¬ 
ed Muslim saint, Shaikh Baha-ud-dln Zakariya Quraishi of Multan. 
This is confirmed by ‘Abdul Haq as well as by another contem¬ 
poraneous writer, GhausI Shah Han, but neither of them refers to 
Shaikh Yusuf Quraishl’s elevation to the throne of Multan. (See 
Akhbar ul-Akhydr p. 209, Gulzdr-i-Ahrdr, Lindesiana MS. fol. 124b, 
A.S.B. Calcutta MS. fol, 64b.)

CHAPTER XI 


THE BAHMANI KINGDOM 

1. THE ORIGIN OF BAHMAN SHAH 

Reference has been made above 1 to the successful revolt in 
the Deccan, in A.D. 1345, during the reign of Muhammad Tughluq, 
and the accession, two years later, of an amir, named Hasan Gangu 
bearing the title Zafar Khan, to the throne at Daulatabad as Abu-’l 
Muzaffar ‘Ala-ud-dm Bahman Shah. 

As usually happens, various stories were current regarding the 
early life and family history of the parvenu king. Even at the time 
when Firishta wrote, there v/ere too many of them and the one that 
he gives as the most credible may be summarised as follows: 

“Hasan, a native of Delhi, was a servant of a Brahman named 
Gangu. Once Hasan, while tilling the field, chanced to discover a 
copper pot full of gold coins, which he carried to his master. Im¬ 
pressed by his honesty, the Brahman brought the fact to the notice 
of the Sultan, who appointed him to the command of one hundred 
horse. The Brahman, who was an astrologer, prophesied his future 
greatness, and made him promise that if he ever became a king he 
would assume the title Gangu.” 

Tabataba and Nizam-ud-dm, the authors respectively of Burhdn- 
i-Ma’dsir and Tahaqdt-i-Akban, both of whom wrote earlier than 
Firishta, give credit to the story that Hasan was descended from 
the hero Bahman, son of Isfandiyar, and therefore the dynasty is 
called Bahman!. Firishta disbelieves the story and makes an empha¬ 
tic assertion to the following effect: “If has been asserted that he 
was descended from Bahmun, one of the ancient kings of Persia, 
and I, the author, have even seen a pedigree of him so derived, 
in the royal library at Ahmudnuggur; but it was probably only 
framed, after his accession to the throne, by flatterers and poets, for 
I believe his origin v/as too obscure to admit of being traced. The 
appellation of Bahmuny he certainly took out of compliment to his 
master, Gungoo, the bramin, a word often pronounced bahmun. The 
King himself was by birth an Afghan.” It is to be noted that though 
neither Tabataba nor Nizam-ud-dm refers to the Brahman episode, 
the latter as well as Yahya, an earlier authority, calls the king Hasan 
Gangu or Kanku. The attempt to explain away Kanku as a scribe’s 
corruption of Kaikaus is hardly satisfactory. 2 The story given by 


248 


THE BAHMANi KINGDOM 


Firishta, therefore, cannot be dismissed off-hand as ‘absurd’, 3 nor 
is it incompatible with epigraphic and numismatic evidence, as many 
have held. The title Bahman Shah is mentioned in the Gulbarga 
Mosque Inscription and is also found on the coins of the dynasty. 
It seems to be the most appropriate appellation which the courtiers 
of ‘Ala-ud-dln could suggest to him, taking info consideration the 
king’s sense of gratitude to the Brahman, Gangu, and the identity 
of the Persianized form, Bahman, of the caste name Brahman, with 
the name of the great Persian King Bahman, son of Isfandiyar. In 
Gulbarga there is, to this day, a street called Baihmanipura, where 
the majority of the residents are Brahmans, and some of them 
describe themselves as descendants of Gangu. 3a On the whole, it 
seems much safer to leave open the question of the origin and early 
history of Plasan and the real significance of the dynastic appella¬ 
tion Bahmani. The story of Firishta cannot be set aside or even- 
regarded as less probable than the descent from an ancient Persian 
hero. In any case we may reasonably hold that Hasan w T as born in 
humble life and was by his own efforts elevated to the throne. 

The dynasty he founded became famous in history as the 
Bahmani dynasty and it ruled the Deccan for the next two hundred 
years. 

2. THE GULBARGA PERIOD (1374-1422) 

Soon after the ceremony at Daulatabad, Bahman Shah selected 
Gulbarga as his capital. It remained the seat of the Bahmani 
government till about 1425 when, during the reign of Ahmad Shah 
Vali (1422-1436), the capital was shifted to Bidar. A great city 
grew in place of the old provincial town of Gulbarga with palaces 
for the Sultan and the grandees of his court, mosques, bazars and 
other public buildings. Situated centrally in the new kingdom, 
Gulbarga was able to command its Marathi, Kannada and Telugu 
areas effectively. 

The first task of Bahman Shah was to impose his sovereignty 
over the many dissident elements that had grown up in the Deccan 
during the period of upheaval preceding his elevation to the throne. 
He sent his first expedition towards the Nasik area to drive out 
the remnants of the Tughluq army in the Deccan and to show the 
flag of the new dynasty to the Hindu chiefs of Baglana. His armies 
are said to have gone as far as the Dangs 4 beyond Baglana. Another 
expedition was directed to places near the capital, such as Akalkot, 
Bhum and Mundargi. “Each of the zamlndars of that district 
(Mundargi) who submitted to his rule he left in undisturbed posses¬ 
sion of his feudal lands.but any who disputed his authority, 


240 



THE DELHI SULTANATE 


their country and goods were plundered, and they and those under 
them put to death”. 5 Isma‘Il Mukh, who had abdicated in favour 
of Bahrnan Shah, was given a jtigir near Jamkhandi in the hope 
that he would subdue that area and bring it under submission. But 
Narayana, a Hindu chieftain of this area, succeeded in turning 
Isma‘11 against his king. This disaffection was shortlived, as, soon 
after, Isma‘11 was poisoned by the Hindu chief. The vigorous mea¬ 
sures taken by Bahrnan Shah for the punishment of Narayana also 
enabled him to consolidate his rule in the present Bijapur district. 
The Sultan then turned his attention towards Karhad and Kolhapur 
and the passes leading to the Konkan ports of Dabhol and Khare- 
patan. It may be noted that the ports on the Konkan coast and 
the roads and passes leading to them were controlled by Gulbarga, 
and that much of the Konkan territory did not come into Bahmani. 
possession till Mahmud Gavan organized campaigns for this purpose 
in the next century. In the north-east, the territory up to Mahur 
(19° 49' N and 77° 58' E) was brought under Bahmani sway, and in 
the south, portions of western Telingana including the strong fortress 
of Bhonglr (17° 31' N and 78° 53' E) were occupied. These expedi¬ 
tions also resulted in considerable material benefit by way of tri¬ 
butes in cash, jewellery and elephants and helped the Sultan in 
building a strong army. Thus was the newly created kingdom 
consolidated. 6 

Bahrnan Shah’s dominion had two Hindu neighbours, which, 
like itself, had emerged on the break-up of the Tughluq empire. 
One was Warangal, under Kapaya Nay aka, 7 on the south and south¬ 
east, and the other, Vijayanagara, a more modern but more powerful 
State than Warangal, on the south and south-west. This proximity 
of two powerful Hindu kingdoms to an equally powerful Muslim 
kingdom explains the chronic warfare of the next hundred years 
that characterizes the history of the Deccan. The Bahmani kingdom 
was determined to advance as far south as Madura, the limit of the 
Tughluq empire, and the Hindu kingdoms were as determined to 
prevent this advance. 

Bahrnan Shah led his first campaign against Warangal in 1350 
when he compelled its ruler Kapaya Nayaka to cede to him the 
fortress of Kaulas (18° 50' N and 77° 80' E) as the price of peace, 
and imposed on him an annual tribute. Henceforward, all wars bet¬ 
ween the Bahmanls and Warangal can be traced either to Kapaya’s 
neglect to pay the stipulated tribute or to his demands for the resto¬ 
ration of Kaulas. According to Firishta, Bahrnan Shah invaded the 
Carnatic, but it is doubtful whether it brought him into conflict with 
Vijayanagara itself. But the war certainly began in the next reign. 


250 


THE BAHMANI KINGDOM 


Bahman Shah created an aristocracy by bestowing titles like 
Khan and Malik on the majority of his officers, while the more in¬ 
fluential and powerful among them were decorated with special 
distinctions like Qutb-ul-Mulk, Khvaja Jahan etc. The highest title 
was AmIr-ul-Umara‘ and this was given to Isma‘11 Mukh in recog¬ 
nition of the royal position he had occupied. The dignity of a royal 
court and royal palace also demanded many officials or diwans, and 
so positions of treasurer ( khazan ), superintendent of elephants 
(shahnah-i-fll) , keeper of the seals (daivat-dar) , lord chamberlain 
( sayyid-ul-hujjdb ), royal taster ( chashritgir ) etc. were created and 
bestowed on trusted servants. 8 Two other positions were the royal 
secretary ( dabir ) and constable of the city ( hajib-i-qasabah ) which 
in course of time were conferred upon persons with the rank of a 
minister rather than upon ordinary court officials. 

The Sultan found a ready made pattern of administration which 
he could adopt. Two years before the Deccan became indepen¬ 
dent, Muhammad Tughluq had divided it into four shiqs. Bahman 
Shah accepted this idea and continued to have four divisions to each 
of which he appointed a governor with an appropriate title. He, 
however, discontinued the term shiq for these divisions. 9 

*‘Ala-ud-dIn Hasan Bahman Shah died in A.D. 1358 at the age 
of 67 and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Shah. 

*The reign of Muhammad Shah saw the beginning of that long- 
drawn struggle with Vijayanagara which continued, with intervals, 
till the final breakdown of the latter kingdom. According to Firishta, 
the king’s father, ‘Ala-ud-din Hasan, “sent a considerable force into 
the Carnatic” which returned with a rich booty exacted from “several 
rajas”. In the absence of any specific reference to Vijayanagara, 
it can only mean a successful raid into the borderland between the 
two kingdoms. The actual war between the two newly founded 
succession states of the Sultanate broke out in the reign of Muham¬ 
mad Shah. It was a defensive war which Muhammad had to wage 
against the combination of the two Hindu States of Vijayanagara 
and Telingana. It may be pointed out that the rivalry between the 
BahmanI kingdom and Vijayanagara was primarily due to those 
political and economic factors which led, even in the Hindu period, 
to age-long struggles between the powers who occupied the two 
sides of the Krishna-Tungabhadra line such as the Chalukyas and 
the Fallavas, the Rashtrakutas and the Cholas, etc. 

*The ruler of Telingana, Kapaya Nayaka, formally demanded 
the fortress of Kaulas which ‘Ala-ud-din Hasan had wrested from 
him; while Bukka, the king of Vijayanagara demanded the Krishna- 
Tuhgabhadra-doab, presumably on the ground that it had always be- 


251 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


longed to the southern State. As these two demands were presented 
almost simultaneously, there was hardly any doubt in the mind 
of Muhammad, that the two Hindu States had entered into an alli¬ 
ance against him, and this was really the case. 

* After temporizing for some time, Muhammad Shah not only 
refused the demands but made counter-demands upon the two Hindu 
kings. Thereupon Kapaya sent his son Vinayaka Deva with a large 
army to seize the fortress of Kaulas, while Bukka sent twenty 
thousand men to his help and invaded the Raichur dodb (A.D. 1362). 
The allied force was defeated near Kaulas and Kapaya, being pursued 
up to Warangal, was forced to buy peace by offering a large amount 
of money and over twenty-five elephants. Soon after this agree¬ 
ment was reached, quarrel broke out again and Muhammad Shah, 
by a surprise attack on Palampet, seized the young prince Yinayaka 
and put him to death with barbarous cruelty. In course of his re¬ 
turn, the Sultan suffered a great deal from the guerilla tactics of 
the enemy. He was himself wounded and of his 4,000 soldiers only 
1,500 returned with him. Next year Muhammad Shah received a 
report from the secret service, instituted by him at Delhi, that 
Kapaya, enraged at the death of his son, had approached Firuz 
Tughluq for assistance against him. He immediately invaded Telin¬ 
gana (A.D. 1363) with a large army. Kapaya was unable to with¬ 
stand the force and concluded a treaty by paying a large amount 
of money and ceding Golconda which was fixed as the perpetual 
boundary between the two kingdoms. Kapaya also presented a 
turquoise throne which henceforth was used as the royal throne of 
the Bahmanls. This account is based almost entirely upon Firishta, 
and it is difficult to say whether we may accept it as unvarnished 
truth. As will be shown later, in the chapter on Yijayanagara, 
Firishta gives a similar account of the successive victories won by 
Muhammad Shah against that kingdom. But the terms of the treaty 
which ended the war clearly indicate that Muhammad Shah had to 
concede all the major demands of Bukka. The cession by Kapaya 
of the fortress of Golconda is an undoubted fact, and indicates his 
discomfiture in the war. On the other hand, according to Firishta 
himself, when Muhammad Shah began the campaign he was 
“resolved on the entire conquest of Telingana”, 9 * and yet he con¬ 
cluded a treaty, fixing Golconda as the perpetual boundary between 
the Bahmanl kingdom and Telingana. This certainly indicates that 
perhaps the small Hindu principality of Telingana did not fare as 
badly as Firishta would have us believe. Equally doubtful is 
Firishta’s statement, that being reproached by the ambassadors of 
Yijayanagara for indiscriminate massacre of Hindu women and 
children, Muhammad Shah “took an oath, that he would not, here- 


252 


THE BAHMANI KINGDOM 


after, put to death a single enemy after a victory and would bind 
his successors to observe the same line of conduct” 9 ’ 0 But Firishta 
exceeds all limits when he observes: “From that time to this, it has 
been the general custom in the Deccan to spare the lives of prisoners 
in war, and not to shed the blood of an enemy’s unarmed subjects”. 90 
The account of Firishta himself gives a direct lie to this statement. 

The last campaign in Telingana lasted for about two years and 
was immediately followed by a protracted war with Vijayanagara 
which will be described in the next chapter. After this campaign 
was over Muhammad Shah reigned in peace and prosperity. He 
turned his attention to the improvement of administration and 
consolidation of authority over his extensive kingdom till his death 
in A.D. 1375. Muhammad Shah indulged in wine and other vices, 
but a story is told how in deference to the wishes of a pious shaikh, 
Muhammad Shah abjured the use of wine in public and ordered the 
closure of distilleries in the kingdom. This enforced temperance 
proved to be a shortlived reform and seems to have passed away 
towards the close of the Sultan’s reign. The reign of Muhammad 
Shah marks the beginning of an independent Deccan architecture to 
which reference will be made later. He was also the first to organize 
the artillery and to use it in fights against Vijayanagara. 9 * 

Muhammad I was succeeded by his son ‘Ala-ud-dln Mujahid 
(1375) whose short reign is chiefly remembered for his Gargantuan 
appetite and physical prowess which earned him the sobriquet of 
‘halawant’. The chief event of his short reign of about three years 
was his campaign against Vijayanagara as will be related later. 
While returning from this campaign, Mujahid was murdered by his 
cousin Daud 9e (1378) who then ascended the throne. Within about 
a month, however, Mujahid’s partisans avenged his death by 
assassinating Baud, and setting on the throne Baud’s brother, 
Muhammad II, in preference to Baud’s son, Sanjar, who was blinded. 

The king of Vijayanagara took advantage of these political 
troubles to wrest a large slice of territory on the western coast, in¬ 
cluding the port of Goa. But barring this, the long reign of Muham¬ 
mad II was on the whole peaceful, and he put an end to palace 
and court intrigues and the regicide atmosphere that had grown in 
the capital. The Sultan was, however, no match for his rival, the 
king of Vijayanagara, who consolidated his authority in the eastern 
regions in defiance of him, as will be related later. Muhammad Shah 
II was essentially a man of culture, and he tried to attract to his 
kingdom men of piety and erudition. He made Fazullah Anju, one 
of the learned divines of the time, Sadr-i-Jahdn or Chief Justice 
and Minister for Religious Endowments, and invited the great Hafiz 


253 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to his court. But the poet, on being caught in a storm on embarka¬ 
tion at Ormuz, decided to abandon his voyage. He sent an ode to 
the king instead, for which a rich present was returned to him by 
the royal patron. The Sultan himself was a very learned man and 
was nick-named Aristotle by his subjects. With learning he com¬ 
bined an abiding interest in the welfare of his subjects. When his 
kingdom was ravaged by a famine he made prompt and efficient 
arrangement for the transport of grain from Gujarat and Malwa and 
its distribution among Muslims only at cheap rates. He established 
orphanages in various centres in the kingdom tv/o of which were at 
the Konkan ports of Chaul and Dabhol. 10 

Muhammad II died in April 1397, and was succeeded by Ghiyas- 
ud-din. Malik Saif-ud-dln Ghuri, the powerful and able Bahmani 
minister who had rendered distinguished and loyal services to the 
new dynasty since the reign of its founder and had a large share 
in setting up the Bahmani administrative machinery, died the very 
next day after Muhammad II. A Turkish faction now raised its 
head in Gulbarga under the leadership of Taghalchln, an unscrupul¬ 
ous adventurer. The king had incurred Taghalchin’s wrath by re¬ 
fusing to appoint him to the governorship of Gulbarga and to the 
position of Vakil-us~saltanat rendered vacant by the death of Saif- 
ud-din Ghuri. Unfortunately, the king, infatuated by the beauty 
of Taghalchin’s daughter, put himself in his power and was seized, 
while alone, and blinded (June 1397). Taghalchln then raised to 
the throne Ghiyas-ud-din’s younger half-brother as Shams-ud-dln 
Daiid Shah. He had won over to his cause the young king’s mother, 
who had been a maid-servant of Ghiyas-ud-din’s mother, and with 
her support he became the regent of the kingdom. This degradation 
of the royal family and the dominance which the upstart Taghalchln 
had acquired, excited the wrath of the late king’s cousins Firuz and 
Ahmad, who were married to his sisters, daughters of Muhammad II. 
In the palace revolution that now followed Taghalchln was over¬ 
powered, Shams-ud-din was deposed, and Firuz Khan ascended the 
throne as Sultan Taj-ud-dln Firuz Shah on November 16, 1397. 
Ghiyas-ud-dln, the blinded and deposed king, who had been kept 
in confinement at Sagar, was brought to Gulbarga, and Taghalchln 
was produced before the monarch whom he had so basely treated. 
The blind Ghiyas-ud-din with a sword struck at Taghalchin and 
slew him. 11 

*Firuz Shah had an eventful reign of tweny-five years (1397- 
1422). It was marked by three distinct campaigns against Vijaya- 
nagara in 1398, 1406 and 1417. In spite of Firishta’s grandiloquent 
description of the brilliant successes of Firuz in his first campaign 


254 


THE BAHMANI KINGDOM 


culminating in the siege of Vijayanagara, the silence of other Muslim 
chroniclers seems to indicate that FIruz did not probably invade the 
Raichur dcab, far less advance up to the capital city Vijayanagara. 
The campaign does not seem to have brought any conspicuous suc¬ 
cess on either side, as will be related later. 

*But far more important were the two subsidiary campaigns 
waged by FIruz. The first was against the Gond Raja Narsing Rai 
of Kherla, about four miles north of Betul in Madhya Pradesh. 
According to Firishta, he had invaded Berar at the instigation of the 
neighbouring Muslim rulers of Malwa and Khandesh, and on the 
advice of the Raja of Vijayanagara. After concluding treaty with 
Vijayanagara, FIruz proceeded against Narsing who offered a stub¬ 
born resistance but not having received any help from outside, as 
he hoped, offered submission. 

*Far different was the state of affairs in Telingana where the 
two rival factions, the Vernas and Velamas, were actively supported, 
respectively, by the rulers of Vijayanagara and the BahmanI king¬ 
dom. Here, again, Firishta speaks of the uniform success of FIruz, 
but in reality he could achieve very little. At first when the main 
army of FIruz was occupied on the banks of the Krishna fighting 
against Vijayanagara, the forces of the latter won complete victory 
in Telingana. After the conclusion of treaty with Vijayanagara and 
the submission of Kherla, FIruz advanced in full force to Telingana. 
He obtained some successes at first, but was forced to retreat when 
Kataya Verna’s lieutenant, Allada Reddi, defeated the BahmanI com¬ 
mander, ‘All Khan. 

*Firishta’s account of the second BahmanI campaign against 
Vijayanagara begins with a romantic love episode of Devaraya, and 
ends with his daughter’s marriage with the Muslim Sultan, which 
was a unique event in those days. But the omission of all reference 
to this marriage by Nizam-ud-dln, and a very different account of 
the whole campaign by a still earlier author throw doubt on the 
entire account of Firishta about the success of FIruz. 

The third campaign (A.D. 1417-20) centred round the siege of 
the fort of Pangal by FIruz and ended in his total discomfiture by 
the army of Vijayanagara. FIruz, being defeated, escaped from the 
field, and his territory was laid waste with fire and sword. Thus the 
net result of the long-drawn struggle between the BahmanI king¬ 
dom and Vijayanagara was a stalemate. The status quo was main¬ 
tained and the Raichur doab, the bone of contention, remained in 
possession of Vijayanagara. 

The defeat and discomfiture of FIruz weighed so heavily on his 
mind, and undermined his prestige to such an extent that the forces 


255 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


of unrest once again reared up their head. Added to this was the 
rift between him and the famous Khvaja Glsu Daraz, the saint 
openly declaring that the Sultan’s brother, Ahmad, should be the 
next ruler instead of Hasan, the son of FIruz. Attempts were made 
by two courtiers of FIruz to imprison Ahmad Khan, but the partisan¬ 
ship shown towards him by the saint influenced the army which 
declared for Ahmad. The royal force was defeated by Ahmad and 
he besieged the capital. The old and sick FIruz was carried into 
the battlefield, but he swooned, and the citadel surrendered. FIruz 
realized his position and wisely offered the throne to his brother, 
himself abdicating. Ahmad ascended the throne at Gulbarga on 
September 22, 1422, and on October 2, FIruz died. 

FIruz was an enlightened ruler, but not a rigid Muslim. 
Though fond of wine and music, he delighted in holding learned 
discourses with philosophers, poets, historians and other learned 
men whom he gathered round him. He encouraged the pursuit of 
astronomy and built an observatory near Daulatabad. He construct¬ 
ed the new city of Flruzabad on the Bhima and occasionally used 
it as his capital. He devoted much attention to the two principal 
ports of his kingdom, Chaul and Dabhol, which attracted trading 
ships from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and poured into the king¬ 
dom articles of necessity and luxury not only from Persia, Arabia 
and the African coast, but also from Europe. It is said that he was 
an accomplished linguist and a good calligrapher, and that he used 
to copy sixteen pages of the Qur'an every four days. Though nomi¬ 
nally an orthodox Sunni, he was not averse to make use of the 
license, given by later theologians, for contracting many temporary 
marriages. He thus collected a large harem consisting of women 
of many nationalities and it was his boast that he could speak to 
each of them in her own tongue. 

3. BAHMANI ADMINISTRATION 

The reign of FIruz Shah Bahmani saw the end of the Gulbarga 
period of the dynasty. In spite of regicides and internal troubles 
this was a period of expansion, consolidation and struggle against 
external powers which began soon after Zafar Khan had founded 
the Bahmani kingdom. The Bahmani administrative system was 
modelled on the Islamic pattern. The king was the supreme power 
in the State. He was ruler, judge, administrator, military leader, 
sometimes even preacher and leader of public worship. Plis duties 
were as all-embracing as his authority. The king was the shadow 
of God on earth. But only Mujahid Shah Bahmani (1375-78) seems 
to have claimed this distinction. 12 


256 


THE BAHMANi KINGDOM 


Bahman Shah, the founder of the dynasty, was content to 
acknowledge the theoretical supremacy of the ‘Abbasid Caliphate; 
he had a black canopy over his throne in the ‘Abbasid fashion 13 and 
on his coins he styled himself as “right hand of the Caliphate”. 14 

Though in theory the king’s authority was unlimited, in practice 
he depended on the advice of his ministers in deciding questions of 
State policy. The chief duty of the ministers was, of course, implicit 
obedience to the king’s wishes. They were responsible to him in 
the smallest matters and held office during his pleasure. 

The chief minister was called vakil-us-sultanat. All orders 
issued by the king passed through him and bore his seal. The 
minister for finance was the arntr-i-jumla. The wazlr-i-ashraf was 
in charge of external affairs. Two other ministers were the wazlr-i - 
kull and the peshwa with somewhat undefined duties. The sadr-i- 
jahan was the chief judicial authority and was in charge of reli¬ 
gious matters and religious endowments. 15 There were various other 
junior ministers like the nazir and the kotwdl 16 on the civil side 
and qiir beg-i-maisarah (commander of the left wing) and the qur 
beg-i-maimanah (commander of the right wing) on the military 
side. 17 

The provincial administrative system of the Bahmanis owes its 
origin to the founder of the kingdom. ‘Ala-ud-dln Bahman Shah 
had divided his kingdom into four divisions, each of which was en¬ 
trusted to an officer. During the reign of his son Muhammad, these 
divisions were named tarafs, and the officers in charge of them, called 
tarafdars . 18 These provincial governors were supreme in their res¬ 
pective divisions. “They collected the revenue, raised and com¬ 
manded the army and made all appointments both civil and military, 
in their provinces”. 19 Naturally they tended to become powerful. 
But during the early days of the Bahmanis, they were held in check 
by the strong personality of the king himself, who, every year, 
spent some time in touring the various divisions and in supervising 
the administration of his officers. Moreover the tarafdars could be, 
and were indeed, transferred from one province to another. 20 The 
BahmanI kingdom slowly grew in extent and in the reign of 
Muhammad Shah III (Lashkari) reached its furthest limits. Mah¬ 
mud Gavan, the famous minister of Muhammad Shah Lashkari, re¬ 
divided the kingdom into eight sarlashkar ships. 21 This arrange¬ 
ment and the system of transfers were intended to control the power 
of the tarafdars. But they failed to cure the evils which were further 
accentuated by civil war. 

Usually one, and some time more, of these tarafdars were also 
ministers at the BahmanI court. Mahmud Gavan was the vakil-us~ 

257 

D.S.—17 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


sultanat to Humayun Shah (1458-1461) and also tarafdar of the 
Bijapur division. Similarly during the succeeding reign, Khvaja 
Jahan, who was vakil to Nizam Shah BahmanI (1461-1463), was also 
the governor of Telingana; and Mahmud Gavan, who was made both 
amir-i-jumla and ivazir-i-kull, was retained in charge of Bijapur. 22 
Each of the tarafddrs was, ipso facto, a military officer and held the 
rank of a commander of 2,000 horse. 23 

The sub-division of a taraf was known as sarkar, which in its 
turn was further divided into parganas. A pargana consisted of a 
certain number of villages, the village being the smallest unit of 
administration. 

4. THE BID AH PERIOD (1422-1538) 

Ahmad Shah BahmanI, the successor of Firuz and famous in 
history as the Vali or saint, seems to have shifted the BahmanI 
capital from Gulbarga to Bidar some time about 1425. 24 After the 
conquest of Warangal, the BahmanI kingdom extended in the east 
and Bidar was the most central point for this augmented dominion. 
The three linguistic areas of the kingdom converged on this city; 
it had moreover a far better climate than Gulbarga and strategi¬ 
cally a far stronger situation. But there was perhaps a political 
motive behind this change to which reference will be made in the 
chapter on Vijayanagara. 

Almost immediately after his accession, Ahmad Shah decided 
to carry out the unfulfilled wishes of his brother, and declared war 
on Devaraya II of Vijayanagara. Firishta, in his usual manner, 
describes how the BahmanI king forced Devaraya II to sue for peace 
by laying his country waste and besieging his capital. The Raja 
of Warangal, who had joined Devaraya II and then deserted him, 
soon paid the penalty for his folly. After the close of his campaign 
against Vijayanagara, Ahmad Shah marched towards Warangal in 
1425. The Raja was defeated and slain, and Warangal was finally 
annexed to the BahmanI kingdom. 

It was during Ahmad Shah’s reign (1422-1436) that the BahmanI 
kingdom first came into conflict with the kingdoms of Malwa and 
Gujarat w T hich like itself had risen out of the Tughluq empire. In 
the conflict against Malwa, Ahmad Shah carried the victorious 
BahmanI flag into that dominion and overawed it with his might so 
that during the rest of his reign there was no further trouble bet¬ 
ween the two kingdoms. 

Ahmad’s conflict against Gujarat was of his own seeking. He 
took sides with a Hindu chieftain of the Gujarat kingdom who had 
risen in revolt against his overlord, the Sultan of Gujarat, and had 


258 


THE BAHMAN! KINGDOM 


come to Ahmad Shah Vail via Khandesh. In A.D. 1429, Bahmani 
troops were sent to help the rebel and they raided the Nandurbar 
district of the Gujarat dominion only to be expelled from there and 
to be driven out of Khandesh back into Bahmani territory. Next 
year (1430) another Bahmani army, under Khalaf Hasan Basrl, was 
sent to occupy the island of Salsette. It encamped on the Mahim 
creek with the Gujarat army facing it on the opposite (Bandra) side. 
But this attempt to occupy Gujarat territory also proved futile. In 
this campaign we see the beginning of the Deccani-pcLrdes! rivalry. 
The Deceani officers under Khalaf Hasan treacherously quitted his 
camp with the result that the Gujaratis were able to gain an easy 
victory over Khalaf Hasan. It was most probably in this campaign 
that the islands of Mahim and some territory south of it were 
annexed to the Gujarat kingdom. The hostilities against Gujarat 
made Ahmad seek the alliance of Khandesh which was achieved by 
the marriage of the Sultan’s son, ‘Ala-ud-dln, with the daughter of 
Naslr Khan Farruql. 

After the death of Ahmad Shah Vail his son, ‘Ala-ud-din Ahmad, 
who succeeded him, built a magnificent dome over the grave of his 
father on the outskirts of the new capital. The ceiling and walls 
of this tomb were decorated with paintings composed of calligraphic 
devices or floral designs. The colours of these paintings, especially 
of those on the ceiling, are still fresh and bright as if they were 
done only a few years ago. These paintings are considered unique in 
India for their beauty and elegance. From one of the inscriptions 
in the tomb we get the correct date of Ahmad Shah’s death, 29th 
Ramzan, 839 (April 17, 1436). A very interesting practice connect¬ 
ed with this tomb is that an annual fair is held near it, in honour, 
of the Vail, by the priests of the Lingayat sect, a ceremony which, 
legend claims, started when the tomb was built. 

The reign of ‘Ala-ud-dln Ahmad (1436-1458) opened with a 
campaign against Vijayanagara, and there was another struggle in 
A.D. 1443-4. Both were confined to the Raichur doab and will be 
described later. ‘Ala-ud-dln Ahmad subdued the chiefs of the 
Konkan region. In the year of his accession an army was sent 
against the Raja of Sangamesvar (17° 16' N and 73° 33' E) who not 
only offered submission but gave his beautiful daughter in marriage 
to the Sultan. This lady, known to history as Pari-chehra or Zlba- 
chehra (Fairy face), was the Sultan’s favourite queen, and the cause 
of much jealousy and annoyance to the first queen, the daughter 
of Naslr Khan of Khandesh. Naslr Khan, partly instigated by his 
daughter and partly encouraged by the Sultans of Gujarat and 
Malwa, declared hostilities against his son-in-law and marched with 


259 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


an army into his dominion. Khalaf Hasan BasrI was once again 
entrusted with the charge of the Bahmani army which consisted 
exclusively of pardesis . With the defeat at Mahim due to the 
treachery of the Deecanis, still fresh in his mind, Khalaf Hasan 
was able to persuade the king and the Deccani Vakll-us-Sultanat 
Miyan Minullah to agree to such a step. He inflicted a defeat on 
the Khandeshis on the battlefields of Berar and drove them back 
into their territory. But this new policy of exclusion rankled in the 
minds of the Deecanis, and finally led to the massacre of the pardesls 
at Chakan, as will be described in the next section. 

The last years of ‘Ala-ud-dm Ahmad’s reign were marked by 
the rebellion of his brother-in-law, Jalal Khan, who proclaimed him¬ 
self as king of Telingana (1455). The Sultan himself marched against 
the rebel who took refuge in the fortress of Nalgonda (17° 3' N and 
79° 16' E) and sent his son, Sikandar, towards Malwa to beseech 
the help of that kingdom. Sikandar gained support of Mahmud 
Khalji of Malwa by representing that ‘Ala-ud-dm Ahmad was 
dead and disorder had broken out in the Bahmani dominion. 
‘Ala-ud-dm at this juncture placed Mahmud Gavan in charge of 
the siege of Nalgonda, and proceeded to the north to meet the 
danger created by the conduct of Sikandar. Mahmud Khalji, finding 
that he had been misled by false information about the death of the 
Bahmani Sultan, relinquished his campaign and retired to his king¬ 
dom. Mahmud Gavan secured royal pardon both for Jalal Khan 
and his son and their rebellion was over. This is the first occasion 
when Mahmud Gavan, the great Bahmani minister and one of the 
greatest figures of medieval India, comes first into notice. He had 
arrived at Dabhol in 1453 as a merchant and finding his way to 
Bldar and attracting royal notice, had been enrolled in Bahmani 
service and entrusted with the siege of Nalgonda. In this very 
first task Gavan had acquitted himself creditably; his rise henceforth 
at the Bahmani court was rapid. 

‘Ala-ud-dm Ahmad’s reign is notable for the large hospital he 
established in his capital early during his reign. A number of vil¬ 
lages were endowed to this institution from the revenues of which 
were paid the cost of medicine and food of the patients and possibly 
also the salaries of the staff. Both Hindu and Muslim physicians 
were employed in this hospital 26 and it can be inferred from this 
that it was open to patients irrespective of caste and religion. In 
this connection it may be mentioned that for about the last four 
years of his life the Sultan suffered from a festering wound in one 
of his shins, and, if the account of the Marathi Gurucharitra written 
in c. A.D. 1550 is to be believed, the Sultan got some relief from the 
ministrations of Nrisimha Sarasvati, famous in his time as a saintly 


260 


THE BAHMANI KINGDOM 


person and revered by people to this day. It is said that the Sultan, 
despairing of cure for his ills, as a last resort went to the SvamI 
who himself visited the royal patient in his capital and cured him. 
Some of the present day scholars attribute the death of the king 
to his wound, but neither Firishta nor Tabataha make any state¬ 
ment to that effect, and the latter merely states that the Sultan 
died in Jamadi 1, 862 A.H. (April, 1458). 

The short reign of Humayun (1458-1461) was marred by con¬ 
stant unrest and rebellions in the kingdom and among its Hindu 
vassals. The stern and ruthless attempts of the Sultan to put down 
these forces of disorder seem to have earned for him the sobriquet 
Zalim (cruel) at the hands of Firishta. This chronicler records the 
most horrid deeds of cruelty perpetrated by Humayun. 26a Nor 
does the author of the Burhan-i-Ma’dsir spare the king. But the 
picture of his reign as given by both these chroniclers appears to be 
overdrawn, when we read the sentiments of the minister Mahmud 
Gavan towards his royal master as expressed in his letters. 26 

Humayun’s son and successor, Nizam Shah Bahmani, a boy 
of eight years, also had a short reign of about two years during 
which the administration of the kingdom remained in the hands of 
a council of three consisting of the Queen-mother, assisted by two 
of the ablest men in the Bahmani Court, Mahmud Gavan and Khvaja 
Jahan Turk. The Queen-mother herself was one of the few remark¬ 
able women that have appeared in the ruling dynasties of medieval 
India. Though she did not appear in public, she kept herself in 
close and constant touch with her colleagues of the council from 
whom and from her personal agents she received daily reports of 
the affairs of the kingdom. She directed that her son, the boy king, 
should sit every day in the hall of audience and preside over the 
royal darbdr so that he should gain full knowledge of current affairs 
and familiarity with the details of administration. The Council of 
Regency also declared a general amnesty in favour of those who had 
been imprisoned during the harsh rule of Humayun, a wise measure, 
the credit for which goes mainly to Mahmud Gavan. 

While the internal condition of the kingdom was being thus 
strengthened by the Council of Regency, the king of Orissa, Kapi- 
lendra, in the belief that a State ruled by a child was likely to prove 
weak in war, made an alliance with the king of Telingana and 
marched against the Bahmani kingdom. He made his way to the 
very outskirts of the capital Bldar, but the military leadership of 
Mahmud Gavan and Khvaja Jahan triumphed and the invaders were 
repulsed. Hardly had this affair ended when Malwa made war on 
the Bahmani kingdom Mahmud Khali I, the Sultan of Malwa, 


261 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


marched through the northern territories of BahmanI dominion and 
occupied Bidar from which the king had been removed to FIruzabad. 
In this distress Mahmud Gavan appealed to Gujarat for help and 
Mahmud Begarha marched with an army to the Deccan. The com¬ 
bined efforts of the BahmanI forces and the Gujarat allies resulted 
in the enemy withdrawing towards Malwa. Next year (1463) 
Mahmud Khaljl again invaded the BahmanI dominion, but retreated 
when he heard that Gujarat was ready once again to help the 
Deccan kingdom. 

Young Nizam Shah BahmanI died on July 30, 1463, on the very 
day of his marriage, and was succeeded by his younger brother 
Muhammad Shah III (1463-82). The Council of Regency, which had 
guided the affairs of the BahmanI kingdom during the earlier reign, 
continued to function till 1466. Khvaja Jahan Turk had about this 
time come under suspicion of disloyalty, and in that year the Queen- 
mother contrived his murder in open court. Mahmud Gavan was 
now appointed Vakil-us-Sultanat (Deputy of the kingdom) or the 
Prime Minister, and he remained in supreme authority till his 
murder in 1481. During the fifteen years that Mahmud Gavan was 
at the helm of administration, he successfully fought against Orissa 
and Vijayanagara and enlarged the boundaries of the kingdom from 
Orissa to Goa. His most important military achievements were the 
conquest of Hubli, Belgaum and Bagalkot which brought the whole 
of the former Bombay-Karnatak under BahmanI sway, the com¬ 
plete subjugation and consolidation of the Konkan, and the occu¬ 
pation of the important port of Goa. This port, which was jealous¬ 
ly guarded by the Vijayanagara kings, had for long been coveted 
by the Bahmanls, and is described by Gavan himself as “the envy 
of the islands and ports of India”. The Sultan himself showed great 
military leadership in all these campaigns which earned for him 
the title Lashkarl . 

* . x ' i'* 

These new conquests enriched the resources of the kingdom and 
Athanasius Nikitin, the Russian traveller who visited Bidar about 
1470, describes it as “the chief town of the whole of Muhammadan 
Hindustan”. The nobles and people of the city and its buildings 
gave him an impression of great luxury, well-being and wealth. 
Nikitin describes the royal palace as wonderful to behold, and on an 
‘Id day he saw the Sultan in a dress studded with precious stones and 
with a large diamond in his head-dress, riding on a charger with 
a golden saddle. To this wealth of the city, Gavan added the dig¬ 
nity of scholarship by founding a madrasah or school equipped with 
a library and housed in a glittering building with glazed tiles on 
its outside. But Gavan and his administrative reforms had excited 
the envy and jealousy of the Deccanis which finally culminated in 


262 


THE BAHMANi KINGDOM 


his murder. Before proceeding further it is necessary to discuss 
fully the causes and results of this base and melancholy tragedy. 

5. PARTY STRIFE IN THE BAHMANi KINGDOM 

As stated above, Hasan, the founder of the Bahmani dynasty, had 
divided his kingdom into four provinces, which, under his successors, 
were known as tarafs and were placed under governors known as 
tarafdars. These provincial governors enjoyed great powers. In 
their respective dominions they were supreme. The tarafdari system 
worked smoothly as long as it had behind it the momentum of a 
strong personality,—either of the king himself, or of an able minister 
like Mahmud Gavan. But when it became rigid and the tarafdars 
acquired local prestige, it became difficult to cope with its separa¬ 
tist tendencies. 

The progress of these centrifugal forces was further accentuated 
by the fact that, about the middle of the fifteenth century, the 
ruling Muslim aristocracy had split itself into two rival groups, the 
Deccanis and the pardesis or ‘foreigners’. The Deccanis were the 
domiciled Muslims. No doubt they had originally come from out¬ 
side the Deccan, but a stay in the Deccan extending over gene¬ 
rations had changed their manners, ways of living and outlook oh 
life, and had even altered their complexion. The descendants of 
the Muslims whom Hasan, the first Bahmani king, entertained in 
his service, had also, a century later, become natives of the country, 
and had no longer any extra-territorial interests. Many of them 
had native blood in their veins, for a number of Muslim invaders 
originally coming into the Deccan had married women belonging 
to the country. This class also contained Hindu converts to Islam. 
Fathulliah ‘Imad Shah, the founder of the ‘Imad Shah! dynasty of 
Berar, and Ahmad Nizam Shah, who established the Sultanate of 
Ahmadnagar, were both originally Brahmans. Naturally, there¬ 
fore, the Deccanis looked upon their native land as their particular 
preserve, and viewed with suspicion every foreigner entering the 
Deccan as a future rival and a possible competitor for a position at 
court and a place in the king’s favour. 

The pardesis, as their name implied, were not natives of the 
Deccan; year by year they came into the country from abroad in 
increasing numbers. The Bahmani kings made it a matter of policy 
to employ these pardesl adventurers freely in their army, and a 
continuous supply of foreigners, mostly soldiers, poured into the 
country. A number of pardesis came for trade and, like the traders 
of a later age, found it to their advantage to take part in the politics 
of the country. To those soliders of fortune from Persia, Turkey, 


263 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Central Asia, Arabia and Afghanistan, the Deccan in those days was 
the land of adventure and promise, a land where valour was recogniz¬ 
ed and statesmanship rewarded. 

From the very beginning of the Bahmani kingdom, the 
‘foreigners’ wielded considerable influence in the politics of the 
country. Bahman Shah himself had persuaded many Afghan and 
Mughul amirs —fresh recruits in the Tughluq service from abroad— 
to join his standard. This policy was continued by his successors, 
who, by their patronage, attracted and ensured a continuous supply 
of ‘foreigners’. Mujahid Shah Bahmani (1375-78), in particular, 
showed a conspicuous preference to Persians and Turks. 27 It was 
this policy of preference and exclusion that created in the Deccanis 
a feeling of grievance and ill-usage. 

At first the ‘foreigners’ were few in number and the Deccanis 
did not feel their competition. But with the lapse of time the 
former gained in strength and formed a distinct party. This also 
checked the process of assimilation. When, at first, the pardesls 
were few in number, they intermarried with the native Deccanis and 
were soon merged into the bigger community. But with the growth of 
the pardesl party the ‘foreigners’ became conscious of their separate 
entity and this hindered the process of assimilation. Thus came into 
being the two distinct parties—the Deccanis and pardesls. As a rule 
the pardesls were more energetic and enterprising than the native- 
born Deccanis. They were employed in preference to their less ac¬ 
tive and hardy rivals, and seldom failed to acquit themselves well. 
Many rose to the highest offices in the State to the great annoyance 
of the native Deccanis, who found themselves surpassed in the battle¬ 
field as well as in the council chamber. This resulted in recrimina¬ 
tions and quarrels, and ultimately brought about the internecine 
struggle which followed and weakened the power of the Bahmani 
kingdom, and utimately led to its dissolution. 

Moreover, the ill-feeling between the parties created by oppos¬ 
ing interests was complicated by religious differences. A majority 
of the ‘foreigners’ were Shiahs, while most of the Deccanis were 
Sunnis. Ahmad Shah Vail showed preference for the Shiah creed, 
donated money to Shiah holy places, and invited Shiah saints to 
his court. 28 Yusuf ‘Adil Khan and Sultan Qull, two of the pardesl 
provincial governors, who in the later Bahmani period declared their 
independence, were Shiahs, whereas their two Decoani colleagues, 
Fathullah Tmad-ul-Mulk and Ahmad Nizam-ul-Mulk, were Sunnis. 
The religious factor brought to the side of the Deccanis one class 
of foreigners, the Abyssinians, who were mostly Sunnis. In compe¬ 
tition with the fair, handsome, cultured pardesls from Persia, Turkey, 


264 


THE BAHMAN! KINGDOM 


etc. the dark-skinned, illiterate, unprepossessing Abyssinians were 
at a great disadvantage and were treated with contempt by the 
fair pardesis. The religious factor and the contempt shown towards 
them by the other foreigners had the effect of throwing the 
Abyssinians into the arms of the Deccanis. Thus, in the feuds that 
followed between the Deccanis and pardesis, the former party com 
sisted of the Deccanis and Abyssinians, while the latter was composed 
of Turks, Mughuls, Persians and Arabs. 

Towards the close of the fourteenth century, the Deccanis rea¬ 
lized that they were being gradually displaced from power and place 
by their successful rivals, the pardesis, and waited for an opportunity 
to gain the upper hand at the BahmanI court. This came during 
the latter half of the reign of Ahmad Shah Vali (1422-36) when the 
king suffered a decline alike in his mental and in his physical powers. 
By well-calculated flattery, judicious self-praise, and subtle insinua¬ 
tion against their rivals, the Deccanis manoeuvred themselves into 
the Sultan’s favour. During A.D. 1430-31, the BahmanI army 
was defeated on three successive occasions by the Gujaratis. Khalaf 
Hasan, the pardest minister who had been honoured with the title 
of Malik-ut-Tujjcir 29 by Ahmad Shah, attributed these reverses to 
the cowardice and treachery of the Deccanis. But the latter seems 
to have convinced the king of the incompetence of his pardesT 
adviser. The result was that the Deccanis were raised to power, 
and the administration of government was entrusted to a member 
of their faction, Miyan Minullah DakhanI, who was invested with 
the title of Nizam-ul-Mulk. 30 

On coming to power, the Deccanis openly manifested their de¬ 
sire to suppress the foreigners, and in 1446 treacherously massacred 
a large number of them. In that year an army of Deccanis and 
pardesis was sent against Raja Sahkar Rao Shirke, a chieftain with 
his headquarters at Khelna in south Konkan. The Raja of Sanga- 
mesvar, who earlier had professed submission to the BahmanI 
Sultan, made common cause with the Shirke. These two stalwarts 
once again showed that the spirit of the Konkan was yet unsubdued. 
The invaders, lured by them into the fastnesses of the hilly tracts 
of this region, suffered a crushing defeat with the result that the 
survivors retreated to the fort of Chakan (18° 45' N and 73° 32' E). 
Taking advantage of this, the Deccanis, “who from olden times had 
been deadly enemies of the foreigners”, misrepresented this affair 
to the Sultan, ‘Ala-ud-din Ahmad Shah, and ascribed the defeat to 
the treacherous and inefficient conduct of the Konkan campaign 
by Khalaf Hasan and his pardesi colleagues. The only punishment 
for the foreigners, the Deccanis averred, was extirpation. The 
Sultan, not knowing the perfidy, concurred with the nobles that the 


265 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


surviving foreigners should be put to death. 31 The unfortunate 
pardesis were lured out of Chakan and slaughtered, victims of their 
rivals’ jealousy. 

After the massacre of Chakan, a few foreigners, who, with great 
difficulty, effected their escape, represented to the king the decep¬ 
tion which had been practised on him and gave him the correct 
version of what had taken place. Inquiries were set on foot which 
exposed the duplicity of the Deecanis and their desire for the 
extermination of the foreigners, with the result that they were 
severely punished and degraded in the court and the ‘foreigners’ re¬ 
gained their ascendancy. 32 

6. MURDER OF MAHMUD GAVAN: THE DISSOLUTION OF 

THE BAHMANi KINGDOM 

The massacre of Chakan had set the final seal on the bitter 
mutual hatred between the Deecanis and the pardesis that had been 
steadily increasing for fifty years. Matters at length had gone too 
far; compromise was now unthinkable, and each party wanted to 
destroy and uproot the other. In 1481, by a perfidy reminiscent of 
the massacre of Chakan, the Deccani party contrived the murder 
of one of the greatest statesman in the history of India, Khvaja 
Mahmud Gavan, the pardesi minister of Muhammad Shah Bahmam 
III (Lashkarl). The false accusation and violent death of this up¬ 
right minister constitute one of the tragedies of medieval India. 

The Khvaja, who in the reign of Muhammad Shah III (1463- 
1482) had risen to the highest office in the State, was by birth a 
Persian. He was honoured by the king with the title of Malik 
ut-Tujjar, and he and his followers were permitted to take preced¬ 
ence at court over Hasan Nizam-ul-Mulk Bahri, the leader of the 
Deccani party and tarafdar of Telingana. With the welfare of the 
kingdom at heart and with a strict sense of justice, Gavan tried 
to maintain the balance between the Deecanis and pardesis by an 
equal division of offices between the rival parties. But Hasan 
Nizam-ul-Mulk was jealous of the position of Gavan and was wait¬ 
ing for an opportunity to overthrow the popular minister. 

Mahmud Gavan initiated many reforms. He subdivided each 
of the four main divisions into two and framed regulations for their 
government which curtailed the powers of the provincial gover¬ 
nors. 33 These excellent reforms were made for administrative effi¬ 
ciency, but became extremely unpopular among the Deecanis and 
caused widespread resentment against their originator. The crafty 
and unscrupulous Hasan instigated his followers to put an end to 


266 


THE BAHMANI KINGDOM 


the author of these reforms. So a number of Deccanis, although they 
owed their high offices entirely to Gavan, entered into a conspiracy 
against their patron and hatched a nefarious plot for his destruc¬ 
tion. Yusuf ‘Adil Khan, the right-hand man of Gavan, having been 
dispatched on an expedition to Telingana, the field was left clear 
for the conspirators. A forged letter with the minister’s seal, pur¬ 
porting to invite the King of Orissa to invade the kingdom, was 
suddenly unearthed, and Mahmud Gavan, thus falsely accused, was 
put to death by the order of Muhammad Shah 34 (April 5, 1481). 
This great crime was the immediate cause of the dissolution of the 
BahmanI kingdom. The pardesi amirs refused to stay in the capital, 
and returned to their provinces without the formality of obtaining 
the king’s permission. Even responsible members of the Deccani 
party openly expressed their disapproval of the conspirators and 
joined the camp of Yusuf ‘Adil Khan. Deserted by the foreigners 
and some of the Deccanis, the king was forced to throw himself 
into the arms of the conspirators. Hasan Nizam-ul-Mulk was 
exalted to the dignity of Malik Naib and all the affairs of the king¬ 
dom were placed in his hands.. But Muhammad Shah could not 
forget that he had shed innocent blood; he tried to drown his re¬ 
morse in wine and died from its effects within a year of his minister’s 
death, crying with his last breath that Gavan was tearing out his 
heart. ! •» 

i : • i • ■ - | • • 1 *%' U 

Muhammad’s son and successor Mahmud (1482-1518) being a 
minor authority remained in the hands of Malik Naib. On the 
eve of the coronation ceremony, when all the amirs had gathered 
in the capital, the crafty Deccani formed a plot to assassinate Yusuf 
‘Adil Khan and to extirpate his followers. But the foreigners were 
put on their guard by some of their well-wishers in the opposite 
camp. For no less than twenty days Bldar was a scene of conflict 
between the rival factions and when peace was restored, Yusuf 
‘Adil Khan agreed to retire to Bijapur and Malik Naib was left at 
the helm of affairs in the BahmanI capital. 36 

The regency of Malik Naib did not last long. He was disliked 
by some of his followers for his share in the murder of Mahmud 
Gavan, and his subsequent policy towards the foreigners made him 
intensely hated by a section of the Deccanis. The usual intrigues 
followed and Malik Naib, fleeing for safety, was put to death by 
the Abyssinian governor of Bldar. 36 Thus the Deccani minister 
shared the fate of the great pardesi noble whose death he had so 
basely contrived. 

Once again the swing of the pendulum brought the pardesls 
to power. Once again their rivals conspired to destroy the influence 


267 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 

which they still possessed, going to the length, this time, of form¬ 
ing a conspiracy to murder the king and to place another prince 
of the royal family on the throne. 37 They suddenly attacked the 
royal palace one night in October 1487, but were repulsed by the 
valour of the Turk! guard. The king assembled his foreign troops 
and next morning ordered the conspirators to be put to death. 
The slaughter lasted for three days and the foreigners took a terrible 
retribution on the Deccanis for the wrong they had suffered. 

* After these events, Mahmud Shah took no interest in the 
affairs of State and the responsibility of government passed into the 
hands of Qasim Band, a TurkI amir of Sunni persuasion. The power 
and prestige of the BahmanI kingdom were gone for ever, and the 
provincial governors refused to acknowledge the authority of Qasim 
Barid. The defection of Malik Ahmad Nizam-ul-Mulk, the son of 
Malik Naib, started the process of disintegration. Two expeditions 
were sent against him, but they were of no avail. He had the full 
sympathy of Yusuf ‘Adil Khan of Bijapur and Fathullah Tmad-ul- 
Mulk of Berar. In June 1490, Ahmad assumed independence in the 
city of Ahmadnagar founded by and named after him. 38 His col¬ 
leagues, Tmad-ul-Mulk and Yusuf ‘Adil, soon followed suit, with 
the result that by the end of that year the BahmanI king had defi¬ 
nitely lost his sovereignty in reality, if not in name. For the three 
governors, though exercising full autonomy, still kept up the 
pretence of nominal allegiance to the phantom Sultan, and did not 
exercise the sovereign’s prerogatives of issuing coins and reading 
the Khutba in their own names. 

* Mahmud Shah BahmanI continued to reign as a nominal 
sovereign till A.D. 1518, Even in this helpless state he rallied round 
him all the amirs of the kingdom with a view to prosecuting the 
war against the “infidels” of Vijayanagara. In the year 907 A.H. 
(A.D. 1501), it was resolved at Bidar that “once in each year the 
whole of the amirs and wazirs should come to the royal court, and 
join in a jihad against the idolaters of Vijayanagar, and, hoisting 
the standards of Islam, should use their utmost endeavours to eradi¬ 
cate the infidels and tyrants”. 39 In pursuance of this resolution, 
Mahmud Shah exhausted the resources of the decaying BahmanI 
kingdom by launching expeditions against Vijayanagara, and brought 
repeated disasters upon it, as will be related in the chapter on 
Vijayanagara. 

*The sentiments of unity or fellow-feeling among the nobility 
of the BahmanI kingdom did not, however, extend beyond the com¬ 
mon desire to extirpate the idolators of Vijayanagara. There were 
continual dissensions and struggles among themselves which were 


268 


THE BAHMANI KINGDOM 


mostly caused by the desire to get hold of the person of the nominal 
sovereign. The Bijapur forces captured Gulbarga and drove away 
its governor, who fled to Bidar. Qasim Barld received him cordially 
and led an army accompanied by the Sultan against Bijapur. But 
the royal army was routed and the Sultan was taken prisoner by 
Kamal Khan, the de facto ruler of Bijapur. The Sultan was confined 
to his palace and a Bijapur! noble was appointed to keep close guard 
over him. But this enhancement of the power of Bijapur brought 
about a combination of other nobles against that principality. There 
were also factions and dissensions in the Bijapur court as a result 
of which Kamal Khan was assassinated. 

* These forces of disintegration were at full work when Mahmud 
Shah died in A.D. 1518. He was succeeded by four kings who 
were kings in name but really puppets in the hands of Amir Barld, 
son of Qasim Barld, who was in control of the Bahmani capital. 
With the death of Kalimullah, the last of these titular kings, some 
time in A.D. 1538, the Bahmani dynasty came to an end, and the 
kingdom was split into five independent Sultanates, namely, the 
‘Adil Shahi of Bijapur, the Qutb Shiahi of Golconda, the Nizam 
Shahi of Ahmadnagar, the Barld Shahl of Bidar, and the Tmad 
Shahi of Berar.

25a. Firishta records that after Humayun’s rebel-brother Hasan was captured, he 
(Humayun) had stakes set up on both sides of the market and brought there 
elephants and various wild beasts; cauldrons of scalding oil and boiling water 
were also kept ready. Humayun, sitting on a balcony, first ordered his brother 
to be thrown before a ferocious tiger who tore the unfortunate prince into 
pieces. The rest of the rebels were then put to death in various manners, 
some being flayed by scalding oil or boiling water. The female members of 
the family of some of the principal rebels were “dragged from their houses, 
were violated and ill-treated in the public square by ruffians, in a manner too 
indecent to relate. Tortures were now invented by the King, who inflicted on 
both young and old of both sexes torments more cruel than ever entered the 
imagination of Zbhak and the tyrant Hijjaj. About seven thousand persons, 
including females and servants, none of whom had the most distant concern 
in this rebellion, besides the menials, such as cooks, scullions and others, were 
put to death.’’ (Briggs, II, 462-3.). 

Tabataba also states that Hasan was thrown to a tiger and adds: “After 
that Sultan Humayun Shah opened the hand of tyranny and oppression, and 
overthrew the foundations of mankind with the sword of injustice, and used 
to murder whole families at once.” (BK, 87) Tabataba adds that on the death 
of Humayun the following chronogram was composed giving the date of his 
death: 

“Humayun Shah has passed away from the world. 

“God Almighty, what a blessing was the death of Humayun. 

“On the date of his death the world was full of delight. 

“So ‘delight of the world’ gives the date of his death.” 

(Zuq-i-jahdn which means ‘delight of the world’ is equivalent to 586, the 
Hijra year of Humayun’s death. BK, 88). It should be noted that Mahmud 
Gavan owed his high position to Humayun and served under his son, so that 
he had very good reasons for referring to that monarch with respect. (Ed.)

CHAPTER XII 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 

1. THE FOUNDATION 

Reference has been made above to the growing Hindu resistance 
against Muslim aggression in Deccan and South India during the 
reign of Muhammad Tughluq, 1 and of his policy of subduing it by 
appointing, as governors, renegade Hindus who once held positions of 
authority in those regions. The policy, as we have seen, failed in 
Warangal, but succeeded in Kampill. The two fugitive brothers from 
Warangal, Harihara and Bukka, who became ministers in the old 
Hindu kingdom of Kampill but were taken captive by Muhammad 
Tughluq and embraced Islam, were entrusted by the Sultan to res¬ 
tore the Muslim authority in that region. In spite of reverses and 
failures at the beginning, they ultimately succeeded in their task as 
has been mentioned above. Their subsequent conduct, however, be¬ 
lied the expectations of Muhammad Tughluq, and in view of the 
obscurity surrounding it and the important consequences which 
followed, the whole matter requires a somewhat detailed conside¬ 
ration. All the relevant facts are not known with absolute certainty 
and widely different views have consequently been held on the sub¬ 
ject; but the following appears to be the most reasonable recon¬ 
struction of the chain of events leading to the foundation of the king¬ 
dom of Vijayanagara. 

The victories of Kapaya Nayaka and Ballala III and the libe¬ 
ration of the Andhra and Dravida countries appear to have affected 
the province of Kampill profoundly. The spirit of independence 
must also have stirred the minds of the people there, and made 
them restive under the rule of their Muslim governor. Harihara 
and Bukka, who must have followed closely the course of the war 
of independence, realized that it was impossible for them, under 
the changed circumstances, to maintain the authority of the Sultan 
in the province. They had, however, no desire to follow the example 
of Malik Maqbul, the governor of Tiling; nor did they consider it 
wise to declare their independence and set up a Muslim dynasty 
at Kampill. Hemmed in on three sides by the two powerful Hindu 
kingdoms of Karnataka and Andhra, and with no prospect of getting 
any help from Delhi, the chances of establishing an independent 
Muslim State on the banks of the Tungabhadra were remote. They 
decided, therefore, to throw in their lot with their Hindu subjects. 


271 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Islam, which they were compelled to embrace, sat lightly on them, 
and they still cherished fondness for the faith of their fathers. 
Under the influence of sage Vidyaranya, whom they accepted as 
their guide both in temporal and spiritual matters, they came to 
believe that it was their duty to renounce Islam and champion the 
cause of the ancient Hindu dharma. Their path was not free from 
obstacles. The Hindu society was chary in re-admitting within its 
fold those who were forced to embrace Islam. Moreover, they were 
treated with suspicion on account of their connection with the 
Musulmans. They, however, got over these difficulties with the 
help of Vidyaranya, who arranged for their reconversion to Hindu 
religion. He convinced Vidyatlrtha, his own guru and the chief 
pontiff of the Advaita-matha at Sringerl, that the reconversion of 
his disciples was necessary for saving the Hindu dharma, and secur¬ 
ed his approval. Harihara and Bukka were then taken back to 
Hinduism; and to mitigate any suspicion that might still lurk in 
the minds of the people, it was declared that Harihara was not rul¬ 
ing the kingdom in his own right but as a vicegerent of the god 
Virupaksha to whom it actually belonged. To lend colour to this 
declaration, Harihara was persuaded to adopt the name of the god 
Sri Virupaksha as his sign manual with which he had to sign all 
the state documents. Harihara was crowned in A.D. 1336 as the 
king of the new kingdom of Hampi-Hastinavati; and to comme¬ 
morate the event he laid the foundations of his new capital, Vijaya- 
nagara, on the same day. la 

2. HARIHARA I (A.D. 1336-1356) 

At the time when Harihara I, son of Sahgama, declared his in¬ 
dependence and celebrated his coronation, he was the master of a 
kingdom extending from Nellore in the south-east to Dharwar and 
Badami in the northern Karnataka. His position, however, was not 
yet secure, as he was surrounded by powerful neighbours who were 
not well disposed towards him. His kingdom marched in the north¬ 
east and the north along the frontiers of the nascent Andhra confede¬ 
racy which Kapaya Nayaka, after his final victory over the army 
of the Sultan of Delhi, was attempting to convert into a kingdom. 
Though Kapaya had no grievance against Harihara, he was an ally 
of Ballala III, recently discomfited by Harihara on the battlefield. 
Moreover, Prolaya Verna, an important member of the confederacy, 
who was driven out of the lower Pennar valley, his ancestral home, 
by Harihara and his brothers, was not certainly friendly to them. 
The struggle between the Rayas of Vijayanagara and the Reddis of 
Addanki and Kondavidu, which was terminated by the absorption 


272 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 

of the territories of the latter by the former, seems to have com¬ 
menced already. In the north-east, on the further bank of the 
Krishna, lay the territory, which still remained under the authority 
of the Sultan of Delhi. Qutlugh Khan, the governor of Devagiri, 
who was entrusted with the administration of this province, was an 
able officer; he was naturally expected to make an effort, as soon 
as possible, to recover the lost Deccan possessions of the Sultan. 
More dangerous than Qutlugh Khan was Ballala III, the king of 
Karnataka, whose territories bounded Harihara’s kingdom on the 
west and south. Ballala was not a friend of Harihara; he cast 
greedy eyes on this small State on the Tungabhadra, the conquest 
of which had been one of his long-cherished ambitions. He led 
several unsuccessful attempts to subjugate it in the days of Kam- 
pilldeva but could make no headway against that doughty warrior. 
The revolt of the Andhras against Muhammad bin Tughluq, and 
the consequent dissolution of his empire in the south gave him 
another chance; but the astute statesmanship of Vidyaranya 
not only frustrated his attempt, but revived under a new dynasty the 
old kingdom of Kampill. However, he did not give up his designs. 
His preoccupations with the affairs of the Tamil country and his 
entanglements with the Sultan of Madura left him no time to make 
a fresh effort to overthrow Harihara, but he was expected to renew 
his attempt the moment he settled with the Sultan of Madura. 
Harihara’s first task was to consolidate his position, and organize 
his kingdom for effective defence. It was an age when the 
security of a kingdom depended on the strength of its 
forts. Anegondi, his capital, was, no doubt, perched on the 
top of a hill in a mountainous tract on the northern bank of the 
Tungabhadra; but it was not impregnable. It fell easily into the 
hands of the enemy twice within a decade; it was captured by 
Muhammad bin Tughluq in A.D. 1327, and by the Chalukya chief 
Somadeva some four or five years later. Harihara wanted to shift 
his capital to a place much more inaccessible to an enemy, where 
he could take refuge in times of danger. Acting upon a suggestion 
of Vidyaranya, he selected the opposite bank of the river in the 
neighbourhood of the temple of Virupaksha, surrounded by the 
Hemakuta, the Matanga, and Malayavanta hills. He laid the founda¬ 
tions of the new capital which he called Vi jay a or Vidyanagara, 
on the auspicious occasion on which he celebrated his coronation. 
The hills were linked together by strong walls of Cyclopean masonry 
and a deep ditch surrounded them. According to one of the Kdla- 
jndnas, it took full seven years to complete the construction. Harihara 
shifted to his new capital, when it was ready for occupation, and 
administered the kingdom from his palace on the Hemakuta hill. 

273 


D.S,—18 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Vijayanagara was not the only fortress built by Harihara. To 
safeguard the kingdom from any possible attack by the armies of the 
Delhi Sultan from Devagiri, he strengthened the fortifications of the 
old Chalukyan capital Bad-ami, and posted there a strong garrison 
under a capable officer. He also made the famous fort of Udayagiri 
in the Nellore district the headquarters of his eastern province, 
and entrusted its administration to his younger brother Kampana. 10 
He appointed his second younger brother, Bukka, his Yuvaraja and 
co-regent and placed him in charge of the fortress of Gooty in the 
Anantapur district to keep a watchful eye on the activities of 
Ballala III and protect the western frontier. Having completed his 
arrangements for the defence of the realm, Harihara next turned 
his attention to internal administration. Two important measures 
adopted by him to increase the resources of his dominions and im¬ 
prove the character of local administration deserve special notice. 
He encouraged the farmers to cut down the forest and bring fresh 
land under cultivation by leasing it to them on easy terms. He 
divided the country into sthalas, nddus, and slmas and created a 
hierarchy of officials to collect the revenue and carry on the local 
administration. These measures increased the income of the State 
and improved the character of local government. 

The reign of Harihara I marks the beginning of a great era of 
conquest and territorial expansion. The small kingdom which at 
the beginning comprised a few Telugu and Kannada districts had 
grown considerably in size and was fast developing into an empire 
during the last years of his reign. This was due mainly to the 
conquest of the Hoysala kingdom which seems to have commenced 
after A.D. 1338 during the last years of Ballala III. A few border 
incidents between the forces of Bukka and Ballapa Dandanayaka, 
the chief minister and commander-in-chief of Ballala III, soon deve¬ 
loped into a general conflict which seems to have gone from the 
first against the Hoysalas. Some time after A.D. 1340, Bukka wrest¬ 
ed from Ballala the important fortress of Penugonda in the Ananta¬ 
pur district to which he shifted his headquarters from Gooty. This 
was a valuable acquisition, as it served him later as a convenient 
base of operations against the Hoysala kingdom. The success of 
Bukka was not due to the weakness of the Hoysala military force. 
Ballala III w 7 as, as stated already, preoccupied with the affairs of 
the Tamil country. Not satisfied with the liberation of Tondai- 
mandalam and the establishment of Sambuvaraya on the throne of 
Kanchi, he set out on an expedition to conquer the entire south and 
bring it under his hegemony. This naturally involved him in a 
conflict with the Sultan of Madura (Ma‘bar), and all his attention 
was absorbed in prosecuting war against him. Ballala, therefore, 


274 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


was not able to take effective steps to check the aggressions of 
Vijayanagara, and as a consequence lost some territory along his 
eastern frontier. What might have happened, had Ballala succeeded 
in his enterprise against Madura it is not possible to surmise. The 
course of events in the south, however, took an unexpected turn, 
quite favourable to Vijayanagara, by the sudden disappearance of 
the enemy who was blocking her path of expansion. Though 
Ballala was successful at first in his war against the Sultan of 
Madura, disaster fell upon him towards the close of A.D. 1342. The 
Sultan of Madura, under the cover of a truce which Ballala granted 
him, suddenly made a treacherous attack on his camp, destroyed 
his army, and having taken him prisoner murdered him after extort¬ 
ing from him all his wealth. 10 

This disaster sounded the death-knell of the Hoysaia monarchy. 
Though Virupaksha Ballala or Ballala IV, the son of Ballala III, 
was crowned king in June, 1343, he was utterly helpless and had 
no power to maintain his authority. The flower of the Hoysaia 
army was annihilated in the campaign of Ma‘bar; his treasury was 
emptied in the vain hope of purchasing the liberty of his father; and 
many of the nobles including the commander-in-chief, Ballappa 
Dandanayaka, deserted him like rats in a sinking ship and joined 
the king of Vijayanagara. Therefore, when he was attacked by the 
armies of Vijayanagara, he was unable to offer any effective resist¬ 
ance, and was obliged to abandon his kingdom and seek safety in 
flight within three months after his coronation. ld The flight of 
Ballala IV was not, however, followed by the immediate submis¬ 
sion of the Hoysaia dominions to Vijayanagara. Though abandoned 
by their king and some of the leading nobles, local chieftains in vari¬ 
ous parts of the kingdom stoutly opposed the invaders; and it was 
not until A.D. 1346 that Bukka could reduce them to subjection. 
The conquest of the Hoysaia kingdom w^as the most notable military 
achievement in the reign of Harihara I. There was great jubilation 
in Vijayanagara. To commemorate the victory, a grand festival 
under the aegis of Vidyatirtha was celebrated at Sringeri in 1346, 
which w^as attended not only by Harihara and his brothers but also 
by all the chief generals and noblemen of his court. 

The conquest of the Hoysaia kingdom seems to have involved 
Harihara I in war with two of his neighbours. The Kadambas who 
were ruling the small kingdom of Banavasi on the coast of Konkan, 
incurred his displeasure, probably on account of the shelter which 
they offered to Ballala IV in their territory. Marapa, one of Hari- 
hara’s younger brothers, set out from Kalasa in the Kadur district in 
A.D. 1347, and having defeated the Kadamba king and annexed his 
territories, established himself at Chandragutti in the Shimoga 


275 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


district. More important than this was the expedition against the 
Sultan of Madura. The circumstances under which Harihara had 
to send an army against Madura are not quite clear. It is, however, 
certain that he embarked on this expedition to rescue the Sarnbu- 
varaya who seems to have been defeated and taken prisoner by the 
Sultan. Two armies were despatched simultaneously in A.D. 1352-3 
against the Sultan, one from Udayagiri in the east coast under Prince 
Savanna, son of Kampa I, and another from Mulbagal in the Kolar 
district under Kurnara Kampana, son of Bukka I, with instructions 
to unite on the frontiers of Madura and compel the Sultan to set 
the Sambuvaraya at liberty. The Vijayanagara generals success¬ 
fully accomplished the task with which they were entrusted. The 
Sultan of Madura was defeated and taken prisoner and the Sambu¬ 
varaya was freed from captivity and re-established upon his throne. 

Though the victory of Vijayanagara was complete and the road 
to Madura was open and undefended, the Sultanate was perhaps 
saved from destruction by the activities of ‘Ala-ud-dln Hasan 
Gangu or Bahman Shah, the ruler of the newly founded BahmanI 
kingdom, who was hostile to Vijayanagara from the beginning. The 
BahmanI Sultan, himself a rebel against Delhi, appears to have 
claimed some sort of suzerainty over Vijayanagara. His claim was 
rejected with scorn and as a consequence the relations between the 
two kingdoms were always strained. As mentioned above, Firishta 
credits Bahman Shah with some conquests in the Karnatak, though 
he does not refer to any conflict between him and the king of Vijaya¬ 
nagara. Bahman Shah’s success, probably over some local chiefs, 
must have been a source of anxiety to Vijayanagara. It seems that 
Harihara I had to give up for the time being his designs over the 
Sultanate of Madura and devote his attention exclusively to the 
defence of his northern frontier. 

The latest known date of Harihara is A.D. 1356. 2 As he is not 
mentioned in the records of the subsequent years, he probably died 
in the course of the same year. Harihara’s reign was a period of 
great political activity. Though he did not directly participate in 
the wars, he took keen interest in organizing the defence of the 
realm. He w T as a great administrator; and with the help of his 
trusted minister, Anantarasa Chikka IJdaiya, he laid the foundations 
of a strong and stable system of civil administration which, with 
few modifications, lasted until the very last days of the empire. 

r 3. BUKKA I (A.D. 1356-1377) 

Harihara I died without issue; and Bukka I succeeded him as 
the sole sovereign of the kingdom. The first step which he took 


276 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARa 


after assuming control of the State was to unify the kingdom and 
strengthen his position. Harihara I had entrusted the administra¬ 
tion of some of the outlying provinces to his younger brothers, who, 
though they acknowledged his supremacy, regarded themselves as 
virtual masters of the territories under their control. Kampana I, 
the Governor of Udayagiri, died about A.D. 1355, and on his death, 
his two sons, Savanna and Sangama II, divided the province bet¬ 
ween themselves, as if it were their family property. Marapa, who 
conquered in A.D. 1347 Male-nadu and Banavasi, became its first 
governor, and most probably he was succeeded by his sons, Sovanna 
and Hariappa. Though the arrangement was working satisfactorily 
at the time, Bukka I realized that it contained the seeds of disinte¬ 
gration which w r ould, in course of time, lead to the disruption of 
the kingdom and defeat the purpose for which it was founded. To 
check the power of his nephews, and bring them more effectively 
under the control of the central government, Bukka appointed his 
own sons as the governors of the provinces and made them respon¬ 
sible for the maintenance of the royal authority. Bhaskara Bhava- 
dura was made the governor of Udayagiri, Kumar a Kampana of 
Mulbagal and Padaividu, Virupanna at first of Penugonda and later 
of Araga, and Chikka-Kampana, Mallapa, and Harihara (II) of the 
Hoysala-rajya. 

The affairs of the Tamil country soon engaged Bukka I’s atten¬ 
tion. Rajanarayana Sambuvaraya, whom Harihara I had restored 
to the throne in A.D. 1353, ruled the country undisturbed until 
A.D. 1359-60. Either because he had asserted his independence or 
for some other reasons not known, Bukka sent a military expedition 
against Rajanarayana who was not able to hold his own. Raja¬ 
narayana died in the early stages of the war; Venrumankondan II, 
his son and successor, held out for some time, but was ultimately 
killed in A.D. 1360. With the death of Venrumankondan, the 
shortlived kingdom of the Sambuvarayas came to an end and Vijaya- 
nagara became the mistress of the Tamil country extending as far 
south as the southern Pennar and the Kolladam rivers. 

Shortly after this Bukka was involved in a war with the Bah- 
manis. On the death of ‘Ala-ud-dln Hasan Gangu (A.D. 1358), his 
son, Muhammad Shah BahmanI I, ascended the throne. His posi¬ 
tion, on the throne, however, was not quite secure. Dangers 
threatened him on every side. Some of his nobles were disaffected 
towards him, and were ready to make trouble for him. Bukka I 
and the king of Telingana, with whom he seems to have entered 
into an alliance, sent Muhammad Shah an ultimatum threatening 
war in case he failed to satisfy their demands. The former claimed 


277 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


that the forts of Raichur and Mudgal with their dependent terri¬ 
tory extending as far as the river Krishna should be returned to 
him. The latter similarly demanded that the fort of Kaulas with 
the dependent territory which ‘Ala-ud-din Hasan had unjustly 
wrested from him should be restored to him. Muhammad Shah, 
after temporizing for a time, declared war on the Hindu kings. 
Bukka I immediately despatched twenty thousand men to support 
his ally, and invaded the Krishna-Tungabhadria-dodb with a large 
force. 

The account of the war given by Firishta is inaccurate and 
one-sided. According to him, Muhammad Shah I defeated Bukka I 
on every battlefield, chased him from place to place, and when at 
last Bukka crept back into his capital, the Bahmanl Sultan lured 
him out of his stronghold and, having crushed him in a battle, 
dictated to him the terms of peace which he had no option but to 
accept. Though some of the facts mentioned by Firishta might be 
true, the Vijayanagara army did not fare so badly in the war as 
he would have us believe. They contended with the Bahmams on 
equal terms, and struck blow for blow. In the end, the Bahmani 
Sultan had to sign a treaty which left Bukka I master of the whole 
of the Krishna-Tuhgabhadra-dodb excepting some mcihals on the 
southern bank of the Krishna which were to be governed jointly by 
the two monarchs. 3 The terms of this treaty, to which Firishta 
himself alludes indirectly, clearly show that the war ended practi¬ 
cally in a victory for Vijayanagara. As the war had commenced on 
account of the refusal of Muhammad Shah I to recognize the river 
Krishna as the boundary between Vijayanagara and the Bahmanl 
kingdoms, and as the river Krishna, according to the terms of the 
treaty, was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms, though 
a few mahals on the southern bank of the river were subjected to the 
joint authority of the two governments, it is obvious that Bukka I 
got the better of his rival. 

The Bahmanl war came to an end in A.D. 1365. Shortly after 
this Bukka I was engaged in a war with Kondavidu. Very little 
is known about the causes and incidents of this war with the Reddi 
kingdom. Prolaya Verna, the founder of the kingdom, died in 
A.D. 1355 and his successor Anapota or Vira-Anapota was defeated 
by Bukka. The Reddis lost Ahobalam and Vinukonda with their 
dependent territories which were permanently annexed to the king¬ 
dom of Vijayanagara. 

When the affairs of the northern and eastern frontiers were 
thus settled to his satisfaction, Bukka I turned his attention to the 
south. The overthrow of the Sambuvarayas and the annexation of 


278 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


Tondaimandalam had brought Vijayanagara directly into contact 
with the Sultanate of Madura. A clash between the two kingdoms 
was inevitable; and the miserable plight to which the Hindus were 
reduced by the Muslim rulers of Ma‘bar loudly called for interven¬ 
tion. Most of the Hindu shrines were destroyed; good many of 
them were converted into mosques. The people were killed by 
hundreds and thousands; their properties were confiscated; religious 
practices were forbidden; cows were butchered; and terror reigned 
supreme. Bukka, as the head of a Hindu State which was founded 
specially to protect the Hindu society and re-establish the Hindu 
dharma, could not remain indifferent, and launched an attack some 
time about A.D. 1370. He entrusted the supreme command of his 
army to his son, Kumara Kampana, who had been governing the 
Tamil districts of the kingdom as his viceroy since the overthrow 
of the Sambuvaraya in A.D. 1360-61. 

The army set out about the beginning of A.D. 1370 from Gingee 
in the South Arcot district and inflicted a crushing defeat on the 
forces of Madura at Samayavaram near Srirangam. Kannanur- 
Kuppam, the chief stronghold of the Musulmans in this region, fell 
into the hands of the invaders who, after having restored god 
Srlrahganatha at Srirangam and Hoysalesvara at Kannanur-Kuppam 
to their respective shrines, marched against Madura. A severe 
engagement took place somewhere between Trichinopoly and Madura 
in which the Sultan was defeated and killed. The death of the 
Sultan, however, did not put an end to the war. Some of his follow¬ 
ers appear to have shut themselves in the capital and declined to 
submit. Kumara Kampana laid siege to Madura, and took it by 
storm. Thus ended the Sultanate of Madura after a brief but bloody 
existence of nearly forty years during which the Hindus of the 
country were subjected to inhuman tyranny. 3a 

With the conquest of Madura, the whole of South India, extend¬ 
ing up to Setubandha Ramesvaram, came under the sway of Vijaya¬ 
nagara, and it thus rapidly grew up into an empire. The conquered 
territory, together with the remaining parts of the Tamil country, 
was placed under Kumara Kampana who proved as great an admini¬ 
strator as he was a soldier. Unfortunately, however, he died pre¬ 
maturely, about the beginning of A.D. 1374, plunging the kingdom 
in grief. His death brought the question of succession to the fore¬ 
front. Bukka I had several sons who distinguished themselves on 
the field of battle as well as in the civil administration of the king¬ 
dom, but he chose as heir-apparent and successor, Harihara II, his 
son by queen Gaurambika, a prince who took little or no part in 
the affairs of the kingdom until the time of his selection. The rea- 


279 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


sons which prompted Bukka to nominate Harihara as his crown 
prince, ignoring the claims of his more distinguished sons and grand¬ 
sons, are not quite apparent. 

Bukka I did not long survive his son Kampana and died in 
A.D. 1377. He was one of the greatest monarchs of the age, and was 
the real architect of the Vijayanagara empire. He v/as a great 
soldier and achieved conspicuous success on the field of battle, speci¬ 
ally against the Muslims. In an age marked by religious bigotry 
and fanaticism, special reference must be made to the policy of 
tolerance adopted by Bukka I in dealing with the religious sects 
in his kingdom. Taking advantage of the dispute between the 
Vaishnavas and the Jainas, he issued an edict, copies of which were 
set up in important centres, proclaiming that from the standpoint 
of the State, all religions were equal and entitled to protection and 
patronage. The policy of religious concord, indicated in this edict, 
was followed by all his successors. All religious communities of 
the kingdom including the Jews, Christians and Muslims, looked 
upon the Raya as the guardian of their religious rights and privileges. 

Bukka I took an active interest in the revival of the Vedic 
dharma. He assumed the title of V edamdrgcL-pratishthdpadza or the 
establisher of the path of the Vedas, and gathered together all the 
scholars learned in the Vedic literature. Having placed them under 
his kula-guru, Madhavacharya-Vidyaranya and his famous brother 
Sayanaeharya, he commanded them to compose fresh commentaries 
and expounded the meaning of the Vedas and the allied religious 
texts. He also encouraged Telugu literature and was a patron of 
Nachana Soma, the greatest Telugu poet of the age. 

4. HARIHARA II (A.D. 1377-1404) 

Bukka I died about the beginning of February, 1377, and 
Harihara II immediately ascended the throne. His authority, how¬ 
ever, does not seem to have been acknowledged in all parts of the 
kingdom at once. There were insurrections in Konkan and other 
provinces. A wide-spread rebellion broke out in the Tamil country, 
in which the chiefs of Tundira, Chola and Pandya countries were 
involved. It is not unlikely that the sons and some of the officers 
of Kumara Kampana, who were dissatisfied with the late king’s 
arrangements about succession, should have made a common cause 
with the rebels. Harihara II, however, succeeded in putting down 
the rebellions and enforcing his authority. His son, Virupaksha or 
Virupanna Udaiyar, whom he appointed as the viceroy of the Tamil 
country, put down the rebels with a stern hand and brought the 
Tamil country back' to subjection by the middle of A.D. 1377. 4 It 


280 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


was probably on this occasion that Virupanna Udaiyar crossed over 
to the island of Ceylon and exacted tribute from its ruler. 

A greater danger than the internal disturbances threatened the 
stability of Harihara’s position on the throne. The Bahmani Sultan 
invaded his kingdom in large force. Muhammad Shah I died in 
1375, and was succeeded by his youthful and warlike son, Mujahid 
Shah. He sent an envoy to the court of the Raya demanding the 
abrogation of the treaty of A.D. 1365, and the recognition of the 
Tuhgabhadra as the southern boundary of his dominions. Hari- 
hara II naturally turned down this demand, and Mujahid invaded 
the Vijayanagara kingdom by way of reply in the spring of A.D. 1377. 

Firishta has given an elaborate account of this war, but most 
of the incidents described by him are not noticed by other Muslim 
historians; and even in places where they refer to them, their narra¬ 
tive differs from his in important respects. According to Firishta, 
the Raya of Vijayanagara, whom, by the way, he calls Krishna Raya, 
massed his troops on the bank of the Tuhgabhadra, somewhere in 
the neighbourhood of Adoni, but took to flight at the approach of 
the Sultan’s army. Mujahid thereupon laid siege to Vijayanagara, 
and though he achieved some measure of success at first, he was 
obliged ultimately to raise the siege. On his way back he besieged 
Adoni, an important fort, guarding the road from Gulbarga, for nine 
months. His attempts to capture the fort, however, ended in failure, 
and while returning to his capital, having achieved nothing in the 
war, he was assassinated in his tent (A.D. 1378). Of the three im¬ 
portant events of this war described by Firishta, the first two, namely, 
the flight of the Raya and pursuit by Mujahid, and the siege, by the 
latter, of the city of Vijayanagara, are not mentioned by other 
Muslim historians. Though the flight of the Raya and pursuit by the 
Sultan may be dismissed as exaggerated, there is nothing improbable 
in his attempt to besiege Vijayanagara. The invasion, even taking 
Firishta’s account at its face value, must be regarded as an inglorious 
failure. The war, however, did not come to an end with the defeat 
of Mujahid Shah at Adoni and his retreat towards his kingdom. It 
had an interesting sequel which is not noticed either by the Muslim 
historians or modern scholars who have dealt with the subject. The 
defeat of the Bahmani army at Adoni and the subsequent assassina¬ 
tion of the Sultan on his way home presented a great opportunity 
to Harihara II for retaliation. The Bahmani kingdom was defence¬ 
less and there were dissensions in the royal family. Harihara II 
took full advantage of the situation and invaded Konkan and North¬ 
ern Karnataka at the head of a large army. Though the details of 
the campaign are not definitely known, two or three incidents stand 


281 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


out clearly. Madhava mantrin, who was in charge of the Banavasi 
country, defeated the Turushkas, captured the port of Goa and re¬ 
duced the seven Konkanas to subjection (A.D. 1330). The Turushkas, 
from whom Madhava mantrin wrested Goa and the neighbouring 
territories, must have been the officers of the Bahmani Sultan. 5 It 
must have been during the campaign in which Madhava mantrin re¬ 
duced the sapta-Kohkanas that the important ports of Chaul and 
Dabhol on the coast of Northern Konkan were acquired by Harihara; 
and the possession of these ports, besides Goa, must have made him 
master of the entire west coast of the Deccan. 6 

Harihara II, now firmly established on his throne, next sought 
to make himself the lord of the east coast so that he might establish 
his control over the eastern as well as the western sea. The idea of 
the conquest of the east coast was not new. Bukka I, it may be re¬ 
membered, attacked the Reddi kingdom of Kondavidu which blocked 
the expansion of Vijayanagara towards the sea, and seized some out¬ 
lying districts of Kondavidu betv/een A.D. 1365 and 1370. The ap¬ 
pointment of Devaraya as the governor of Udayagiri in A.D. 1370, 
however, marks a new epoch in the relations between Vijayanagara 

and Kondavidu. He resolved from the first to annex the Reddi terri- 
• • • • • 

tories and pursued his object with unwavering zeal. The internal 
dissensions in the kingdom of Kondavidu, on the death of king 
Anavema in A.D. 1382-3, gave him an excellent opportunity to attack 
the Reddi dominions, and he occupied at once the Addanki and the 
Srisailam districts adjoining the Vijayanagara frontier. The occupa¬ 
tion of the Reddi territories, especially the district of Srisailam which 
abutted on the kingdom of Rachakonda, brought in its train another 
war with the Velamas and their ally the Bahmani Sultan. 

After the death of Anapota Reddi of Kondavidu, the Velamas 
had seized Srisailam and the neighbouring territory. Their king, 
Anapota Nayadu I, is even credited with having built steps to the 
Srisailam hill. Anavema Reddi, the younger brother and successor 
of Anapota Reddi, dislodged the Velamas from Srisailam and recon¬ 
quered the lost territory. After the death of Anavema, the Velamas 
naturally desired to re-establish themselves in this region; but the 
prompt action of Devaraya baulked them of their prey. The Velama 
ruler Anapota Nayadu I appealed to his ally, the Bahmani king 
Muhammad Shah II, for help and prepared himself for war. To 
counteract the warlike activities of Anapota Nayadu, Harihara II 
despatched an army under the command of his son Immadi Bukka, 
against the Velamas. The army penetrated as far as Warangal, and 
defeated the Muslim cavalry at Kottakonda, a fort to the north-west 
of Warangal. 


282 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


The Velama king did not, however, give up the hope of conquer¬ 
ing Srlsailam, With the help of the Bahmani Sultan Muhammad 
Shah II, in A.D. 1390-91, he attacked ‘Udayagiri-rajya’, that is the 
province governed by Devaraya. The last-named made a counter¬ 
move by invading the Bahmani kingdom. The Bahmani forces accom¬ 
panied by the Yelamas seem to have made an attack upon Udayagiri, 
but Ramachandra U-daiya, the son of Devaraya, whom he left in 
charge of his capital and province, is said to have subjugated hostile 
kings and vanquished by his skill the Musulman king. 7 Though the 
final result of the war is not known, the Velamas did not achieve 
their object and the Bahmani Sultan won no victories which the 
Muslim historians could boast of. 

The conflict was renewed seven years later (A.D. 1398), when 
Harihara II planned another attack on the Velamas and their ally 
the Bahmanis. He evidently took advantage of the confusion fol¬ 
lowing the usurpation of the Bahmani throne by FIruz Shah to in¬ 
vade that kingdom, and captured the fort of Sagar. According to 
Firishta, FIruz not only recaptured the fort, but crossed the Krishna, 
looted the camp of his enemy, besieged Vijayanagara, laid waste 
the surrounding territory, and compelled Harihara II to buy peace 
by payment of a large sum of money. Though according to the 
terms of the treaty, the boundaries of both the kingdoms remained 
as thev were, Firiiz is said to have directed Fulad Khan to assume 
the government of the Raichur dodb, which, as shown above, be¬ 
longed to Vijayanagara. Other Muslim authorities do not refer to 
the invasion of the dodb or the siege of Vijayanagara. They all, 
however, ignore the part played by the Velama allies of the Sultan, 
as well as the reverses sustained by him. The Muslim accounts of 
the sweeping victories of FIruz Shah are contradicted by Hindu 
sources, both literary and epigraphic. An inscription at Pangal, in 
the Nalgonda district of the old Hyderabad State, clearly proves that 
an expedition sent by Harihara II against the Velamas defeated 
them as well as their Bahmani ally near that place, almost at the 
very time when, according to Firishta, FIruz was dictating a most 
humiliating peace treaty to his enemy. This treaty, however, practi¬ 
cally recognized the status quo. On the whole, the fact seems to 
be that in spite of some initial successes gained by FIruz, he was 
ultimately forced to retreat and lost some territory to the north of 
the doab. 

The last years of the reign of Harihara II were peaceful, un¬ 
disturbed by foreign invasions or internal troubles. He fell ill in 
the latter part of A.D. 1403 and died on August 16, 1404, having 
ruled for a period of twenty-eight years. During his reign of nearly 


283 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


three decades, the kingdom extended in all directions, and assumed 
the proportions of a mighty empire. His conquest of the west and 
east coasts made him the master of many ports through which 
flowed the wealth of Europe and Asia into his dominions. In the 
internal administration of the kingdom, he followed in the footsteps 
of his father. Though he entrusted the government of some of the 
provinces such as Mangalore, Barakur, and Goa on the west coast 
to his nobles, he appointed only his sons as governors of the impor¬ 
tant provinces in the interior and the east coast. As already noted 
above, Virupaksha succeeded his uncle Kumara Kampana as the 
viceroy of the Tamil country. Immadi Bukka, the heir-apparent, 
became the governor of Araga and Koysala regions, and Devaraya I, 
the most capable of Harihara’s sons, assumed the government of 
Udayagiri, the premier province of the empire. Though this 
arrangement worked efficiently in the lifetime of Harihara, it foster¬ 
ed disintegrating tendencies which led immediately after his death 
to the outbreak of the first civil war in the Vijayanagara history. 

On the death of Harihara II, the succession to the throne was 
disputed. His three sons Virupaksha I, Bukka II, and Devaraya I 
laid claim to the throne, and attempted to take forcible possession 
of it. Though the struggle for succession lasted for two years, much 
is not known about the course of events during the period. Viru¬ 
paksha I appears to have crowned himself immediately after the 
death of his father, but his rule came to an end after one year. He 
was probably overthrown by Bukka II who proclaimed himself king. 
He, in his turn, yielded place to Devaraya I, who ascended the throne 
in A.D. 1406 and ruled for sixteen years until his death in A.D. 1422. 

5. DEVARAYA I (A.D. 1406-1422) 

Devaraya I, who emerged victorious from the war of succession, 
ascended the Diamond Throne, and celebrated his coronation on 
November 7, 1406. His reign was a period of incessant military 
activity, and during the sixteen years of his reign he was, more or 
less, continuously engaged in waging war with the BahmanI 
Sultans, the Velamas of Rachakonda and the Reddis of Kondavidu. 
In spite of the powerful forces arrayed against him, he not only 
held his own but succeeded in increasing the extent of his kingdom 
by the annexation of fresh territories. 

Immediately after Devaraya’s accession his kingdom was in¬ 
vaded by Firuz. Besides the Velamas, the traditional allies of his 
family, the Sultan secured also the friendship of Peda Komati Verna, 
the Reddi king of Kondavidu. Apart from the frequent encroach¬ 
ment by Vijayanagara on the Reddi territory, Peda Komati Verna 


284 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYA NAGARA. 


resented the family and political alliance into which Harihar II 
entered with his rival Kataya Verna who had usurped the govern¬ 
ment of Rajahmundry. The Sultan invaded the dodh with the main 
body of his army, while his Velama and Reddi allies, supported by 
a strong contingent of his troops, attacked the Raya in the eastern 
provinces of his kingdom. Devaraya massed most of his forces 
in the dodb to check the advance of the Sultan, and left the eastern 
provinces comparatively weakly defended. 

According to Firishta, Firuz Shah marched unopposed to Vijaya- 
nagara, and made an unsuccessful attempt to take the city by storm. 
Though wounded and repulsed, the Sultan lay encamped in the en¬ 
virons of the city and harried the country-side. Devaraya sued for 
peace, but the Sultan demanded, in addition to other treasures, the 
hand of the Raya’s daughter in marriage, and the cession of the 
fort of Bankapur as the price of peace. Devaraya agreed to the 
Sultan’s conditions: a treaty was concluded, and marriage performed; 
and the Sultan returned triumphantly to his capital. The account 
of Nizam-ud-dln is in close agreement with that of Firishta, but he 
does not refer to Firuz Shah’s demand for the hand of, and his 
marriage with, Devaraya’s daughter. Tabataba, however, gives an 
entirely different account of the expedition from which it would 
appear that the Sultan’s campaign was confined to Bhanur and 
Musalkal, places situated in the Deodrug taluk in the north-west of 
the Raichur district, from which he returned to his capital, having, 
of course, reduced them to subjection. In view of the conflicting 
evidence of the Muslim historians it is difficult to form a correct 
estimate of the events of the campaign. Nevertheless it is hard 
to believe that Firuz could reach the city of Vijayanagara without 
any opposition. Nor is it at all likely that Devaraya would have 
agreed to a humiliating treaty, especially when he succeeded in re¬ 
pulsing the Sultan’s attack on his capital and compelled him to 
retreat to a respectable distance from it. In the absence of corro¬ 
borative evidence of a more trustwortlty character, one would also 
hesitate to believe that Devaraya offered the hand of his daughter 
in marriage to Firuz Shah as the price of peace, a fact stated only 
by Firishta. 

More reliable information is available about the war in the 
east. The Sultan’s army, accompanied by his Velama and Reddi 
allies, appears to have descended on Udayagiri and obtained several 
notable victories. But what happened after these victories is not 
definitely known. One important result of the expedition was the 
Reddi occupation of Pottapi-nadu and Pulugula-nadu in the south¬ 
east of the Cuddapah district, which continued for seven years until 


285 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


their final expulsion by Devaraya I in A.D. 1413-14. The victory 
of the allies was, however, not complete; for they failed to dislodge 
Devaraya from Pangal which in his hands became a standing menace 
to the safety of the Velama kingdom. 

Reference has been made elsewhere 7a to the dissensions in the 
kingdom of Kondavldu. On the death of Kurnaragiri Reddi in A.D. 
1402, Peda Komati Yema, his cousin, succeeded him at Kondavldu; 
while Kataya Yema, the brother-in-law and minister of the late king, 
made himself master of the northern districts of the Reddi kingdom 
with the city of Rajahmundry on the Godavari as his capital. Peda 
Komati Verna, however, allied himself with the Yelamas, and 
Kataya Yema was driven out of his capital. It is true that Devaraya 
I, who was related to him by marriage alliance, was his friend; but 
so long as he was engaged in the war with Firuz Shah and his 
allies, could not be expected to render any help. Kataya Yema 
was, therefore, obliged to bicle his time and look forward to the 
termination of the war. When at last Devaraya successfully re¬ 
pulsed his enemies and consolidated his power, Kataya Yema paid 
a visit to Vijayanagara in A.D. 1410 and solicited his help. Deva¬ 
raya, who fully realized the value of an independent Reddi State 
on the Godavari as a counterpoise against the Rahman! Sultan and 
his allies, promised help, and promptly despatched troops to enable 
him to recover his power. 

The Vijayanagara army arrived at their destination none too 
soon. The situation was indeed grave. Peda Komati Yema had 
already invaded the Rajahmundry kingdom and crossed the Goda¬ 
vari. Encouraged by the arrival of help from Vijayanagara, Kataya 
Yema took the field and inflicted a crushing defeat on Peda Komati 
Verna at Ramesvaram and put him to flight. But the arrival of 
Firuz Shah and the Bahmani army changed the situation. He won 
a number of victories, and Kataya Verna was killed in one of these 
battles. On hearing of these disasters, Devaraya sent reinforce¬ 
ments. Doddaya Alla, the Commander-in-Chief of Kataya Verna, 
rallied his late master’s forces, and within a short time scored some 
success against the enemy. 8 

The war, however, did not come to an end. It moved west¬ 
wards from the delta of the Godavari to the Velama dominions on 
the north bank of the Krishna; and the Bahmani Sultan and the 
Raya of Vijayanagara, who had hitherto played a subsidiary role, 
became the chief combatants. As noted above, the fort of Pangal 
or Nalgonda-Pangal, as it was known to Firishta, was in possession 
of the Rayas of Vijayanagara since the time of its conquest in 
A.D. 1398 by Bukka II. It was considered the strongest and most 


286 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


celebrated fort in that region and commanded the route from Vijaya- 
nagara to the Godavari delta. Flruz Shah, who realized the strate¬ 
gic importance of the fort, resolved to wrest it from Devaraya and 
sent his forces in A.D. 1417 to capture it. According to one autho¬ 
rity, Devaraya attempted to intercept the expedition but was de¬ 
feated and driven away. The siege lasted for two years, but it 
defied all attempts to take it. The besiegers were reduced to great 
straits on account of famine and pestilence which devastated their 
camp. Devaraya gathered together fresh forces, and having secured 
the help of a number of Hindu chiefs including the Velamas, sur¬ 
rounded the besieging force. The garrison, which had bravely held 
out for two years, encouraged by the distressed condition of the 
Muslim army and the arrival of the succour from Vijayanagara, 
sallied out of the fort and fell upon the camp of the enemy. Caught 
between the two Hindu armies, the Bahmanl forces were cut to 
pieces and the Sultan fled precipitately from the field. Devaraya I 
took full advantage of his victory and re-established his authority 
over the entire Krishna-Tuhgabhadra-dodb. 9 

Devaraya’s intervention in the affairs of the kingdom of Rajah- 
mundry brought in its train war with the king of Orissa. 
The Gajapati Bhanucleva IV, for some reasons unknown at present, 
invaded the kingdom of Rajahmundry. To drive away the Gajapati 
and protect his ally, Devaraya had to despatch a military expedition 
to the Godavari delta. Before fighting could actually begin bet¬ 
ween the Gajapati and the Raya, Doddaya Alla, or Aliada as he 
was more commonly known to his contemporaries, brought about, 
by means of his skilful diplomacy, a friendly understanding bet¬ 
ween the two rulers and persuaded them to return peacefully to 
their respective kingdoms. Though war was thus averted, its signi¬ 
ficance cannot be underrated. For it opens a new chapter in the 
history of the foreign relations of Vijayanagara, and marks the begin¬ 
ning of that rivalry between the Gajapatis and the Rayas which was 
to involve the whole of the east coast into a war lasting for nearly a 
century and quarter. 

The remaining years of Devaraya’s reign were peaceful. The 
kingdom was undisturbed by wars. Devaraya probably spent his 
last years in retirement, seeking diversion in the company of the 
learned whom he greatly cherished. He was a great organizer of 
armies. For a period of 50 years (A.D. 1372-1422) during which 
he participated in the administration of the kingdom, he endeavour¬ 
ed to increase the efficiency of his army. He was the first king 
of his familv to realize the value of cavalry which contributed

their final expulsion by Devaraya I in A.D. 1413-14. The victory 
of the allies was, however, not complete; for they failed to dislodge 
Devaraya from Pangal which in his hands became a standing menace 
to the safety of the Veiama kingdom. 

Reference has been made elsewhere 73 to the dissensions in the 
kingdom of Kondavidu. On the death of Kurnaragiri Reddi in A.D. 
1402, Peda Komati Yema, his cousin, succeeded him at Kondavidu; 
while Kataya Verna, the brother-in-law and minister of the late king, 
made himself master of the northern districts of the Reddi kingdom 
with the city of Rajahmundry on the Godavari as his capital. Peda 
Komati Verna, however, allied himself with the Velamas, and 
Kataya Verna was driven out of his capital. It is true that Devaraya 
I, who was related to him by marriage alliance, was his friend; but 
so long as he was engaged in the war with Firuz Shah and his 
allies, could not be expected to render any help. Kataya Verna 
was, therefore, obliged to bide his time and look forward to the 
termination of the war. When at last Devaraya successfully re¬ 
pulsed his enemies and consolidated his power, Kataya Verna paid 
a visit to Vijayanagara in A.D. 1410 and solicited his help. Deva¬ 
raya, who fully realized the value of an independent Reddi State 
on the Godavari as a counterpoise against the Bahmani Sultan and 
his allies, promised help, and promptly despatched troops to enable 
him to recover his power. 

The Vijayanagara army arrived at their destination none too

vari. Encouraged by the arrival of help from Vijayanagara, Kataya 
Verna took the field and inflicted a crushing defeat on Peda Komati 
Verna at Ramesvaram and put him to flight. But the arrival of 
Firuz Shah and the Bahmani army changed the situation. He won 
a number of victories, and Kataya Verna was killed in one of these 
battles. On hearing of these disasters, Devaraya sent reinforce¬

rity, Devaraya attempted to intercept the expedition but was de¬ 
feated and driven away. The siege lasted for two years, but it 
defied all attempts to take it. The besiegers were reduced to great 
straits on account of famine and pestilence which devastated their 
camp. Devaraya gathered together fresh forces, and having secured 
the help of a number of Hindu chiefs including the Velamas, sur¬ 
rounded the besieging force. The garrison, which had bravely held 
out for two years, encouraged by the distressed condition of the 
Muslim army and the arrival of the succour from Vijayanagara, 
sallied out of the fort and fell upon the camp of the enemy. Caught 
between the two Hindu armies, the Bahmanl forces were cut to 
pieces and the Sultan fled precipitately from the field. Devaraya I 
took full advantage of his victory and re-established his authority 
over the entire Krishna-Tungabhadra-dodb. 9 

Devaraya’s intervention in the affairs of the kingdom of Rajah- 
mundry brought in its train war with the king of Orissa. 
The Gajapati Bhanudeva IV, for some reasons unknown at present, 
invaded the kingdom of Rajahmundry. To drive away the Gajapati 
and protect his ally, Devaraya had to despatch a military expedition 
to the Godavari delta. Before fighting could actually begin bet¬ 
ween the Gajapati and the Raya, Doddaya Alla, or Allada as he 
was more commonly known to his contemporaries, brought about, 
by means of his skilful diplomacy, a friendly understanding bet¬ 
ween the two rulers and persuaded them to return peacefully to 
their respective kingdoms. Though war was thus averted, its signi¬ 
ficance cannot be underrated. For it opens a new chapter in the 
history of the foreign relations of Vijayanagara, and marks the begin¬ 
ning of that rivalry between the Gajapatis and the Rayas which was 
to involve the whole of the east coast into a war lasting for nearly a 
century and quarter. 

The remaining years of Devaraya’s reign were peaceful. The 
kingdom was undisturbed by w r ars. Devaraya probably spent his 
last years in retirement, seeking diversion in the company of the 
learned whom he greatly cherished. He was a great organizer of 
armies. For a period of 50 years (A.D. 1372-1422) during which 
he participated in the administration of the kingdom, he endeavour¬ 
ed to increase the efficiency of his army. He was the first king 
of his family to realize the value of cavalry which contributed 
greatly to the success of medieval armies. By purchasing on a large

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


barga, near Vijayanagara frontier, to Bldar, situated in the hilly 
tract farther north in the interior of his dominions, is not without 
significance. Ahmad Shah’s war on Vijayanagara did not perhaps 
end as favourably to the Sultan as the Muslim historians would 
have us believe. Some unrecorded Vijayanagara attack on Gulbarga 
probably compelled the Sultan to remove the seat of his govern¬ 
ment to a safer distance. That the war did not end in an absolute 
victory for the Sultan is made clear by an epigraph from South 
Kanara district dated A.D. 1429-30, which refers to the defeat of 
the large and powerful Turushka cavalry by Devaraya II. 13 As 
there was but one war between Vijayanagara and the BahmanI 
kingdoms in the time of Ahmad Shah (A.D. 1422-1436), Devaraya 
II’s victory over the Turushkas mentioned in the record must have 
been won during the Bahmani invasion of A.D. 1423. 

Two other victories against the rulers of Andhra and Orissa 
are attributed to Devaraya II in the epigraph cited above. There 
is reason to believe that these two kings were allies and that Deva- 
raya IFs victories over them were not independent but interconnect¬ 
ed events. Although Devaraya II might have been prompted by a 
desire to chastise the Velama ruler for his treachery in the recent 
Bahmani war, he had weightier reasons to launch an attack upon 
the Velamas. For they had joined the Gajapati Bhanudeva IV, in¬ 
vaded the coastal Andhra country, and established themselves there 
having dispossessed the nobles and officers of Vijayanagara whom 
they found in that region. For a period of about five years the 
country remained under their sway, and it was not until A.D. 1428 
that Devaraya II succeeded in dislodging them. 

Very little is known about the events of this war. Bhanu¬ 
deva IV led an expedition to the south, and from the side of the 
Velamas, Linga, the Chief of Devarakonda, joined him. They 
attacked at first the Reddi kingdom of Rajahmundry. Allada, who 
with the help of Devaraya I had revived the power of Kataya 
Verna’s family in A.D. 1417, died in A.D. 1422 or a little later; and 
his second son Virabhadra, who married Anitalli, Kataya Verna’s 
daughter and heir, was crowned king of Rajahmundry. He was 
assisted by his elder brother, Verna, who became, on account of his 
great skill both as a general and an administrator, the real ruler 
of the kingdom. Verna inherited none of the moderation of his 
father, Allada, but followed vigorously the policy of expansion into 
Orissa favoured by Kataya Verna and the early Reddi kings of 
Kondavidu. Bhanudeva probably undertook the expedition to the 
south only to check the growing aggression of the Reddis of Rajah¬ 
mundry but, v/ith the successful prosecution of the war, he seems 


290 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 

to have not only extended the field of his operations but also con¬ 
templated the annexation of the coastal Andhra country to his king¬ 
dom. Though Yema and Virabhadra might have held their own 
against Bhanudeva, they were helpless against the combined forces 
of the Gajapati and the Velamas. They were therefore obliged to 
submit to Bhanudeva IV, acknowledging him as their sovereign and 
overlord. After the subjugation of the Rajahmundry kingdom, 
Bhanudeva IV cast his eyes upon the territories of the erstwhile 
kingdom of Kondavldu. Racha Verna was assassinated in A.D. 1424, 
and the kingdom was left without a ruler. Though some of the 
Vijayanagara officers and nobles seized large parts of the country, 
the Raya was not yet able to enforce his authority effectively, owing 
to the invasion of the Bahmani Sultan. Bhanudeva, therefore, 
crossed the Krishna, and having, with the help of Linga, over¬ 
powered the Vijayanagara nobles and officers, made himself the 
master of the country. 

As soon as Devaraya II freed his kingdom from the Muslim 
invaders, he launched an attack on the Gajapati and the Velamas. 
Though the incidents of this war are lost more or less in obscurity, 
the results are definitely known. The territories of the old Red$i 
kingdom of Kondavldu were reconquered and incorporated with 
the empire of Vijayanagara, and the power of the Reddis of Rajah¬ 
mundry, which was in abeyance between A.D. 1424 and A.D. 1427, 
was completely restored. 

For six or seven years after the conclusion of the war with 
the Gajapati, the kingdom of Vijayanagara enjoyed peace undisturbed 
by any foreign wars and internal disorders. With the death of the 
Bahmani Sultan Ahmad Shah and the accession to the throne of his 
son ‘Ala-ud-dln II, however, the tranquillity of the kingdom was 
broken, and Devaraya II became once again involved in wars with 
the Bahmani Sultan. Two wars are recorded by the Muslim histo¬ 
rians, one in A.H. 839 (A.D. 1435-36), and another in A.H. 847 
(A.D. 1443-44). Both wars were confined to the Krishna-Tunga- 
bhadra -doab and centred round the forts of Mudgal and Raichur. 
In the first war ‘Ala-ud-din was certainly the aggressor, but the 
conflicting accounts of the Muslim historians are hard to reconcile. 
The discrepancies, which throw doubt on their veracity, seem to be 
the result of an attempt to cover the failure of the Sultan’s invasion 
and convert defeat into victory. Taking all facts into consideration, 
it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that Sultan ‘Ala-ud-dln IBs 
invasion of Vijayanagara was a failure. 

The second war broke out, as stated already, in A.D. 1443. 
The causes of this war are thus described by Firishta: Devaraya II, 

291 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


having instituted in A.D. 1437 an inquiry about the causes of his 
frequent defeat in the wars with the BahmanI Sultans, was told 
that it was due in the first place to the inferior quality of the horses 
in his army, and secondly to the excellent body of the archers in 
the service of the BahmanI Sultans. To improve the fighting quality 
of his forces, he enlisted in his service Muslim archers to give in¬ 
struction to his Hindu soldiers; and having soon mustered two 
thousand Muslim and sixty thousand Hindu archers, eighty thousand 
cavalry and two hundred thousand infantry, he invaded the Bah¬ 
manI kingdom with the intention of conquering it. This is very 
far from the truth. There was no need for Devaraya II to institute 
a special enquiry about this time; for Muslims were entertained in 
the service of Vijayanagara monarchs at least from the time of 
Devaraya I; 14 and there were as many as ten thousand Turkish 
troopers in the employ of Devaraya II as early as A.D. 1430, six 
years before the accession of ‘Ala-ud-dln II. The real cause of the 
war was not Devaraya’s determination to conquer the BahmanI 
kingdom, but the desire of Sultan ‘Ala-ud-dln II to take advantage 
of a misfortune that befell Devaraya II, and exact from him a 
large sum of money. Fortunately, the evidence of a contemporary 
Muslim writer, who was present at the time of the outbreak of 
this war in Vijayanagara, enables us to find out the truth, and get 
one more evidence of the totally unreliable character of Firishta’s 
account of the BahmanI-Vijayanagara struggle. 

In A.D. 1443, while Abdur Razzak, the Persian ambassador, was 
sojourning in Calicut, one of the brothers of Devaraya II, having 
invited the king, the prince, and nobles of the kingdom to a feast 
in a palace which he built, massacred all who attended the function. 
Though Devaraya II did not accept the invitation on account of indis¬ 
position, the treacherous brother paid him a visit in the royal palace, 
obviously to persuade him to go to the feast, and finding him alone, 
stabbed him with a poignard in several places. Believing that the 
king was dead he then appeared on the portico of the palace and 
proclaimed himself king. Meanwhile, Devaraya II recovering con¬ 
sciousness dragged himself on to the portico, and commanded the 
people not to recognize the traitor but to seize him and put him 
to death. A crowd of people, who had assembled in the palace, fell 
upon the prince and slew him on the spot. This unfortunate inci¬ 
dent, which involved the slaughter of all those who had any name 
or rank in the State, naturally created chaos and confusion. But 
it also roused the cupidity of the BahmanI Sultan who demanded 
the payment of seven lakhs of vamhas and threatened to invade 
Vijayanagara in case his demand was not met. Devaraya II re- 


292 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


fused to comply with the Sultan’s demand; and as a consequence 
war broke out between the two kingdoms. 

Firishta gives an elaborate account of this war and furnishes 
details not known from other sources. According to him Devaraya II 
invaded the doab, captured Mudgal, and plundered the Sultan’s 
territory as far as Sagar and Bijapur. The Sultan came against 
him with an army of 50,000 horse and 60,000 foot. Three severe 
engagements took place between the main forces of the Sultan and 
the Raya. In the first battle, which was obviously fought under 
the walls of Mudgal, Devaraya II was victorious, and the Sultan 
sustained heavy losses. In the third battle, which was also fought 
under the walls of Mudgal, the eldest son of Devaraya II was killed; 
and the forces of Vijayanagara fled panic-stricken into the fort. A 
treaty was concluded according to which Devaraya agreed not to 
molest the Sultan’s territories in future, and to pay annually a 
stipulated tribute. 

Though Firishta’s account of the war is generally accepted as 
genuine, its authenticity is not above doubt. The Muslim historians, 
who describe at some length the terms of the treaty, are silent 
about Mudgal, which was one of the most important strongholds 
in the Krishna-Tungabhadra-dodb and was wrested, according to 
Firishta, from the Sultan by Devaraya at the beginning of the war. 
If the Sultan left the fort in the possession of the Raya even after 
the conclusion of the treaty, it is certain that notwithstanding 
his boasted victories he could not retake it. At the very time when 
Devaraya II is said to have sued for peace with the Sultan, his forces 
were engaged in a victorious campaign in the east coast against the 
powerful king of Orissa. Having a powerful army flushed with 
victory in the east coast in reserve, it is absurd to suppose that 
Devahaya II would have sued for peace and concluded a treaty with 
the Sultan, who was not even strong enough to retake the fort of 
Mudgal which belonged to him. There is also reason to believe 
that the authority of the Sultan did not extend as far south as the 
Krishna-Tungabhadra -doab; for according to a Persian epigraph of 
the Sultan, the boundary (obviously southern) of his kingdom passed 
through the village of Halsangi in the Indi taluk of the present 
Bijapur district. 15 Having regard for these facts, it is not unreason¬ 
able to suppose that Firishta’s account of the war is, as usual, gross¬ 
ly exaggerated and one-sided, and must be utilized with great caution 
in the reconstruction of Vijayanagara history. 

Two other expeditions which Devaraya II had undertaken about 
this time deserve mention. At the time when Abdur Razzak arrived 
in India in November 1442, Lakkana Dannaik, the Diwdn and 


293 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Commander-in-Chief of Devaraya II, is said to have gone on a naval 
expedition to the frontier of Ceylon. The expedition which must 
have started some years earlier, as it is referred to in inscriptions 
as early as A.D. 1438, was completely successful. The Ceylonese 
were defeated and compelled to pay tribute; and Lakkana re-estab¬ 
lished the power of the Raya over the southern ocean. 

Devaraya II was also called upon to intervene once again in 
the affairs of the kingdom of Rajahmundry. The Reddi rulers, Allaya 
Verna and VIrabhadra, embarked on a policy of aggression and 
conquest, and by constant encroachments on the territories of the 
Gajapati pushed forward the frontier of the kingdom to the shores 
of the Chilka lake. Bhanudeva IV was succeeded by the Gajapati 
Kapilendra, one of the most powerful and ambitious monarchs that 
ever sat upon the throne of Orissa. Kapilendra, who was determin¬ 
ed to put an end to the Reddi aggression, formed very early in his 
reign an alliance with the Velamas, the inveterate foes of the 
Reddis, and seems to have launched an attack upon the kingdom of 
Rajahmundry in A.D. 1443, taking advantage of the preoccupation 
of Vijayanagara with the invasion of the BahmanI Sultan. Deva¬ 
raya II did not, however, leave his allies in the lurch; he sent a 
strong army under Mallappa Udaiyar to drive away the Gajapati 
and re-establish the power of the Reddis firmly in the Godavari 
delta. Here, as in the case of the expedition against Ceylon, no 
information about the incidents of the campaign has come down to 
us, though there is no doubt about its ultimate result. Kapilendra 
was defeated and was compelled to return to his kingdom. Mallappa 
Udaiyar remained for some time at Rajahmundry to restore, in 
accordance with the instructions of his master, the power of the 

Reddis. 16 
• • 

Though Devaraya II ruled for nearly two years more after the 
eastern campaign, no more wars seem to have disturbed the peace of 
the kingdom. According to an epigraph at Sravana Belgola, he died 
on Tuesday, May 24, 1446, after a rule of 25 years. Devaraya II 
was a great monarch. He was the master of an extensive empire 
which extended from the river Krishna to Ceylon and from the 
Arabian sea to the Bay of Bengal. Besides the taxes collected from 
his dominions, he gathered much revenue from the numerous ports 
of his empire. His fleet scoured the seas, and levied tribute from 
Quilon, Ceylon, Pegu and many other countries. He had under him 
one thousand war elephants and an army of eleven lakhs of men. 
Although Devaraya II was frequently at war with enemies, he found 
time to patronize men of letters in Sanskrit and vernaculars and re¬ 
warded them by liberal grants of land and money. He loved to 

294 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


organize literary and philosophical debates in his court and presided 
over them personally. Devaraya promoted fine arts and adorned 
his capital with new temples. 

8. VIJAYARAYA II (A.D. 1446-47) and MALLIKARJUNA 

(A.D. 1446-65) 

The political situation at Vijayanagara immediately after the 
death of Devaraya II is not definitely known. Though it is gene¬ 
rally assumed that his son, Mallikarjuna, succeeded him on the 
throne, there is reason to believe that Vijaya II, more commonly 
known as Pratapadevaraya, younger brother of Devaraya II, ascend¬ 
ed the throne and ruled for a short period. 17 It is evident from 
literary and epigraphic evidence that both Vijaya II and Mallikar¬ 
juna for some time ruled the empire simultaneously. How Vijaya II 
came to be dispossessed of it cannot, however, be ascertained at 
present. He was probably obliged to come to terms with Malli¬ 
karjuna, as a result of which he had to renounce his claim to the 
throne and retire to his estate, where he continued to rule until at 
least A.D. 1455. 18 

The reign of Vijaya II, short as it was, is important on account 
of an attempt made by him to put down ministerial corruption and 
purify the administration of the empire. The ministers of the state 
used to exact presents and collect certain communal taxes in exor¬ 
bitant manner which caused considerable distress in the kingdom. 
Vijaya II resolved to put an end to the practice, and issued orders 
accordingly. As the reign of Vijaya II came to an end soon after 
the issue of this edict, it is not likely that his attempt to reform 
the administration produced any permanent result. 

Mallikarjuna was probably a mere youth at the time of the 
death of his father. He is also spoken in the inscriptions as 
Mummadi Devaraya (Devaraya III) or Mummadi Praudha Devaraya, 
(Praudha Devaraya III). 19 Mallikarjuna was a weak monarch, and 
his accession marks the beginning of the decline in the fortunes of 
the Sahgama dynasty. The rivalry between the Rayas and the 
Gajapatis of Orissa for the possession of the coastal Andhra country 
came to a head; and in the struggle that ensued, the Raya lost 
considerable territory besides the coastal Andhra for which the 
fights began. 

According to the contemporary playwright, Gangadasa, the war 
began with the joint attack of the Gajapati and the Bahmani 
Sultan. 20 This took place probably in A.D. 1450, for in that year 
Mallikarjuna is said to have won a victory over the Mussulmans. 
Though Kapilendra, the Gajapati king, is said in one of the records 

295 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


of his grandson, Prataparudra, to have levied on this occasion a 
heavy tribute from the Karnata king, the statement is not supported 
by any other evidence. No trace of Gajapati rule is found any¬ 
where in the Telugu country during the next four or five years, and 
Mallikarjuna’s authority was recognized until A.D. 1454-55 in the 
coastal region including the old kingdom of Kondavldu. The silence 
of the Bahmarii historians on the subject coupled with Mallikarj una’s 
claim of victory over the Muslim forces, seems to point to the same 
conclusion. Mallikarjuna, therefore, appears to have succeeded in 
repulsing the invaders, as stated by Gahgadasa, and maintaining his 
hold over the whole extent of his empire. 

The Gajapati invasion of Vijayanagara kingdom began, how¬ 
ever, in right earnest four years later. Between A.D. 1450 and 
1454 Kapilendra reduced the Reddi kingdom of Rajahmundry, and 
sent an army under his cousin Ganadeva across the Krishna into 
Kondavldu province of the Vijayanagara empire. The expedition 
was completely successful. Vijayanagara armies were defeated and 
driven out of Kondavldu; and the important forts of Kondavldu, 
Vinukonda and Addanki together with territories dependent on 
them passed into his hands. For four or five years there was com¬ 
plete lull. Kumara Hamvlra, one of Kapilendra’s sons, was appoint¬ 
ed the governor of Kondavldu in the place of Ganadeva, and was 
commissioned to invade and conquer Vijayanagara territories. 

~ . . . o 

Hamvlra was a great warrior and capable general. He led a 
grand army in A.D. 1463 into the southern provinces of the empire 
and was ably assisted by his son Kumara Kapilesvara Mahapatra. 
The Orissan army seems to have met with little or no opposition 
and captured almost all the important forts on the east coast; 
Udayagiri, Chandragiri, Padaividu, Kahchi, Valudulampatti-Usavadi; 
Tiravarur and Tiruchchirapalli rapidly fell one after another. The 
expedition was a grand success and Hamvira won great glory by 
his advance up to the Kaverl. Kapilendra evidently intended to 
annex the whole territory, for he appointed his grandson Kapilesvara 
Mahapatra governor of the extensive area and also made other 
administrative arrangements. But, for some reasons not known at 
present, the Orissan forces were obliged to retrace their footsteps 
within two years. They lost all the forts which they had conquered 
with the exception of Udayagiri in the Nellore district. Thus though 
the expedition caused considerable confusion, it did not lead to any 
permanent result, so far as Orissa was concerned. But it had a 
considerable effect upon the political and economic condition of 
Vijayanagara. The loss of the two strategic forts of Kondavldu and 
Udayagiri, together with their dependent territories, weakened the 


296 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


empire; and the failure to offer successful opposition to the Oriyas 
lowered the prestige of the Raya. 

Mallikarjuna did not long survive the disastrous Gajapati inva¬ 
sion, and died about the middle of A.D. 1465. The end of Malli¬ 
karjuna was not probably peaceful. Tradition preserved in the 
Srivaishnava work Prapannamritam states that his own cousin Viru¬ 
paksha II assassinated him together with the members of the royal 
family and usurped the throne. This is not unlikely; for, though 
Virupaksha II was the cousin of Mallikarjuna, he could not have had 
any claim to the throne, as the latter had a son to succeed him. 
Whether Virupaksha had actually murdered his cousin or not, there 
can be no doubt that he laid violent hands upon the throne and 
took forcible possession of the empire. 

9. VIRUPAKSHA II AND THE FALL OF THE 
SANGAMA DYNASTY (A.D. 1465-1485) 

Though Virupaksha succeeded in establishing himself on the 
throne, he was not able to enforce his authority over the empire. 
The eastern seaboard extending from the Gundlakamma to the 
KaverT, the southern Karnataka, and the bulk of the Western Andhra 
districts, were under the sway of the Saluvas who nominally 
acknowledged his overlordship, but governed their possessions virtu¬ 
ally as independent princes. The successors of Mallikarjuna seem 
to have retired to the banks of the Kaverl in the south, and ruled over 
parts of the Tanjore, South Arcot, Trichinopoly, Coimbatore, Salem 
and Madura districts in their own right, without any reference to 
the authority of Virupaksha. Similarly, on the west coast the 
Tuluva and the Konkan! nobles, who were busy with their local 
feuds, paid little or no attention to his behests. His authority was 
thus confined mostly to Karnataka and portions of the Western 
Andhra country, although he seized the Diamond Throne of the 
Rayas of Vijayanagara. 

The first few years of the reign of Virupaksha II were unevent¬ 
ful. With the death, however, of the Gajapati Kapilendra in 
A.D. 1470, 20a the political conditions in the Deccan began to change 
rapidly. The Bahman! Sultan, who was held in check until that 
time by the fear of an attack from the Gajapati, invaded Vijaya¬ 
nagara possessions in Konkan on the west coast. Muhammad 
Shah III, at the instance of his Prime Minister, the famous Mahmud 
Gavan, sent him at the head of a large army. The first target of his 
attack was Sankara Rao of Khelna. The fort was impregnable and 
Mahmud Gavan succeeded in capturing it after two years, more by 
judicious distribution of bribes than by prowess. Next he planned 


297 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


an attack on Goa both by land and sea, and succeeded in making him¬ 
self master of the place before Virupaksha could think of concert¬ 
ing measures for its defence. The loss of Goa was indeed a severe 
blow to Vijayanagara. As the principal port on the west coast, 
it commanded the trade with Western Asia, Africa, and Europe which 
brought much money into the treasury. The loss of the port cut 
off not only a lucrative source of income to the State but also the 
traffic in horses which was essential for keeping up its military 
strength. Virupaksha did not easily reconcile himself to the loss of 
Goa. He made at least two attempts to recapture the port. Some 
two years after the loss, Birkana Ray (? Vira Kanna Raya), the ruler 
of Belgaum, with the help of the chief of Bankapur, attacked Goa 
at his instance. On hearing this, Sultan Mahammad Shah III, 
accompanied by Mahmud Gavian, marched at the head of a vast 
army and laid siege to the fort of Belgaum. Though Birkana Ray 
offered stout resistance for sime time, he was ultimately obliged 
to submit and enter into the order of nobility of the Bahmani court. 
With the defeat of Birkana Ray, the expedition against Goa 
collapsed, and the Bahmani Sultan kept his hold on the city. Ano¬ 
ther attempt was made in 1481. Immediately after the execution of 
the great minister and the consequent confusion in the Bahmani 
kingdom, Virupaksha sent an expedition against Goa to drive away 
the Bahmani garrison and recapture the port. Muhammad Shah, 
who was at that time in Belgaum, directed Yusuf ‘Adil Khan to 
march with his force to rescue the garrison, and he appears to have 
been successful in repelling the Vijayanagara attack. The success 
of ‘Adil Khan at Goa opened the way for an invasion of Vijaya¬ 
nagara possessions in Tulu-rajya. Gopradana Kesarl (Go Faridun 
Kaisar Khan), the Sultan of Bidire, sent an army under his com¬ 
mander Nijam-ud-dTn Maluka (Malik NTzam-ud-dm) against the 
territories of the chiefs of Nagire and Honnavur in the Tulu-rajya. 
The results of the expedition are not definitely known. The Nagire 
chiefs appear to have been successful in driving back the Musul- 
mans. As a consequence of the operations of Mahmud Gavan in 
Konkan and the west coast, Virupaksha II lost not only the sea¬ 
board of northern Konkan but also the bulk of northern Karnataka. 

• • 

The death of Kapilendra plunged the coastal Andhra country 
into the throes of civil war, and offered an excellent opportunity for 
the Raya of Vijayanagara to win back his lost dominion; but Viru¬ 
paksha did not rise to the occasion. He failed to take advantage 
of the situation to recover the prestige of his government and the 
affection of his subjects. His failure, however, provided Saluva 
Narasimha, one of the prominent noblemen of his kingdom, a splen- 

298 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


did opportunity to emerge as the saviour of the kingdom, and the 
custodian of the power of the Rayas. 

Saluva Narasimha was the eldest son of Saluva Gunda, the 
chief of Chandragiri in Chittoor district. He seems to have succeeded 
to the family estate about A.D. 1456. At the time of his succession, 
his authority could not have been great, though besides his family 
fief of Chandragiri, he seems to have held an estate in the neighbour¬ 
hood of Nagar, in the Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot district. 
The weakness of the central government at Vijayanagara subsequent 
to the defeat of Mallikarjuna at the hands of Ganadeva in 
A.D. 1454, and the loss of the Kondavldu-riajya enabled him to 
enlarge his territory. The frequent attacks of the Gajapati on 
Vijayanagara culminating in the invasion of 1463, created anarchy 
and confusion in the kingdom. The assassination of Mallikarjuna 
and the usurpation of the throne by Virupaksha II gave a further 
impetus to the forces of disintegration; and the nobles and the 
captains, though they outwardly acknowledged the supremacy of 
the Raya, acted pretty much as they liked. It must have been dur¬ 
ing these years of anarchy that Saluva Narasimha laid the founda¬ 
tions of his power. He had already made himself master of Chittoor, 
the two Arcots, and the Kolar districts by the beginning of Viru- 
paksha’s reign. His power was so great that Mallikarjuna’s young 
son, Rajaisekhara, sought refuge at his court. 

Saluva Narasimha resolved very early in his career to free his 
country from the yoke of Orissa. The illness of Kapilendra and 
the outbreak of dissensions among his sons subsequent to his death 
in A.D. 1470 gave him the opportunity he was waiting for. He 
appears to have begun his campaign against the Gajapati in 
A.D. 1469, and after defeating the Oriya force captured the fort 
of Udayagiri which was the southern gate, as it were, of the coastal 
Andhra country. The progress of his expedition was checked at 
this stage by an invasion of the Chola and Tondaimandalam countries 
by the Pandya chief Bhuvanaikavira Samarakolahala at the head 
of the Chevulapotu (Lambakarna) forces who are said to have 
established themselves in the land of the Tigulas, (i.e. Tamils). Nara- 
sirhha expelled the invaders and pursued them as far as Ramesvaram, 
where he received presents sent by the Buddhist king of Ceylon and 
the rulers of other islands. He then proceeded in a south-westerly 
direction and reached Anantasayanam (Trivandrum) where he stayed 
for some time, conducting operations against the Gurukarnas (i.e. 
Lambakarnas) who probably lived somewhere in the neighbourhood. 

Having thus settled the affairs of his southern territories by 
chastising the Pandyas and their Lambakarna allies, Saluva Nara-

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


simha returned to resume the campaign against Orissa, where im¬ 
portant changes had taken place in the meantime. Muhammad 
Shah Bahmani had become master not only of Telingana but also 
of the coastal Andhra country. But partly by diplomacy and partly 
by military victories, Saluva Narasimha completely achieved his 
object. He conquered the whole of the coastal Andhra country to 
the south of the Krishna, captured the port of Masulipatam, and 
took possession of the fort of Kondavldu in A.D. 1480. He thus 
came into possession of the country between the Vijayanagara and 
the Bahmani territories in the east coast and became the greatest 
and most powerful of all the rulers of Telingana and Vijayanagara. 

The acquisition of Kondavldu involved Saluva Narasimha in a 
war with Bahmani Sultan, who not only captured this fort but even 
advanced as far as Kanchi and sacked it. But the murder of 
Mahmud Gavan, which shortly followed, changed the triumph of the 
Bahmanls into a veritable disaster. As mentioned above, in 
chapter XI, this was brought about by a false accusation against 
the minister by his enemies. But a different version of the affair 
is given by Sakhawl who wrote about it between A.D. 1481 and 
1497. He knows nothing about the forged letter of Gavan to the 
king of Orissa. According to him the Sultan was away from the 
Khvaja for seventeen days on a campaign in Narsing’s country. 
Taking advantage of this opportunity, some of Sultan’s favourite 
ministers came to the Khvaja and warned him that Narsing’s army 
would make a night attack upon his camp. He therefore took neces- 
saiy precautions, and made immediate preparations to ward off the 
expected attack. The ministers of the Sultan then returned to him 
and informed him that the Khvaja was making preparations to 
attack the Sultan himself. The latter thereupon summoned the 
Khvaja to his presence and ordered his execution. This is the 
account of Sakhawl. What probably provoked the Sultan to order 
the immediate execution of the Khvaja was an incident which 
happened near Kandukur where the Khvaja was encamped. Isvara, 
the commander-in-chief of Saluva Narasimha’s army, attacked the 
Sultan’s cavalry and destroyed it in a fierce battle. This, coupled 
with the defensive measures concerted by the Khvaja, appears to 
have convinced the Sultan that Gavan was actually in league with 
his enemies. He therefore immediately ordered, without hesitation, 
the execution of the great minister. However that may be, Muham¬ 
mad Shah lost all the spoils of his Kanchi expedition and was morti¬ 
fied by his defeat at the hands of the infidels. It was probably to 
recover his prestige that he sent an expedition under Yusuf ‘Adil 
Khan and Fakhr-ul-MuIk against Saluva Narasimha from his camp 
at Kandukur, and himself marched in person on Masulipatam and 


800 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


its dependent territory still under Narasirhha’s rule. Though the 
Sultan succeeded in capturing Masulipatam, the expedition led by 
Yusuf £ Adil Khan and Fakhr-ul-Mulk ended in a disaster. 

The Vavaha-purdnam mentions a number of places which Saluva 
Narasimha's commander-in-chief, Isvara Nayaka, conquered on be¬ 
half of his master. Of these, Udayadri (Udayagiri) and Nellore 
must have been reduced to subjection during his campaign against 
the Gajapati in A.D. 1469-70. Amuru (Chingleput) and Kovela (i.e. 
Srlrangam), as well as Bonagiri and Chenji, mentioned in the 
Jciimim-Bharatcim, must have been conquered during his southern 
campaign in A.D. 1470. Kongu-Dharapuri (Coimbatore), Kundani 
(Salem), Seringapatam or Srirangapatnam, Nagamangalam, and Ban¬ 
galore as well as Penugonda (Anantapur) and Gandikota (Cuddapah), 
must have been brought under his control in his campaign against 
the nobles and Nayaks, who refused to acknowledge his authority, 
between A.D. 1481 and 1485. Special mention must be made of the 
chiefs of Ummattur who offered stubborn resistance to Saluva Nara- 
siriiha and his successors. They held sway over a large part of 
the southern and eastern Mysore districts and were masters of the 
two island fortresses of Srlrangapatnam and Sivansamudram in 
the Kaverl. Devanna Udaiyar, Nanjaraja and Vira Somaraya, who 
ruled at this time, acknowledged no overlord, but issued charters 
in their own right as independent princes. To make himself 
master of the upper Kaveri valley, Saluva Narasimha had to crush 
them. It was in this connection that he conquered Nagamandala 
(Nagamangala), Srlrangapatnam and Bangalore. Another powerful 
enemy whom he overthrew at Penugonda about this time was the 
Turushka who allied himself with a powerful Sabara chief called 
Pikkillu. Who Pikkillu was and why he joined the Turushkas 
are matters on which no information is available at present. The 
Turushkas were no doubt the Bahmanl soldiers whom Muhammad 
Shah had despatched from Kandukur under the leadership of Yusuf 
‘Adil Khan and Fakhr-ul-Mulk, In the encounter with Narasimha’s 
forces they were defeated and sought safety in flight; and Pikkillu 
lost his life. 

Saluva Narasiiiiha thus became the virtual master practically 
of the whole of the Vijayanagara empire. The measures concerted 
by Virupaksha II to check the growth of his powers are not known. 
The Portuguese chronicler Nuniz, who wrote about the middle of 
the sixteenth century, gives little credit to Virupaksha for anything 
good. He was a bad king sunk in vice, and the vast kingdom which 
he seized began to fall to pieces. He was murdered about the end 
of A.D. 1485 by one of his sons, who, however, renounced his right 


301 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to the throne in favour of his younger brother, Padearao i.e. Praudha 
Devaraya. 

Praudlia Devaraya, who thus obtained the kingdom from his 
elder brother, was a grown up prince who had been associated with 
his father in the administration of the empire since A.D. 1471. He 
was a feeble dissolute prince utterly unworthy of the throne which 
he was called on to occupy. He is said to have been totally indifferent 
to the affairs of the State; but even if he were different in his 
character, he could not have prevailed against such a powerful 
vassal as Saluva Narasimha. The character of Praudha Devaraya, 
however, provided a pretext to Saluva Narasimha to seize the throne 
for himself in the interests of the empire. The time was propitious. 
All the important vassals were subdued and the political affairs in 
Orissa and the Bahmani kingdom were such that there was no fear 
of intervention from these quarters on behalf of Praudha Devaraya. 
Therefore Saluva Narasimha resolved to seize the opportunity. At 
first he won over the nobles to his side by offering them valuable 
presents; and when he felt sure of their support, he sent his army 
under Narasa Nay aka, the son of Is vara Nay aka, to Vijayanagara 
with instructions to expel Praudha Devaraya from the capital and 
take possession of the throne and kingdom in his name. Narasa met 
with no opposition; and when he entered the capital, Praudha Deva¬ 
raya fled from it, and took refuge in a foreign country. With the 
flight of Praudha Devaraya, the rule of the Sangama dynasty came 
to an end. Saluva Narasimha soon followed Narasa Nayaka to the 
capital, and celebrated his coronation about the close of A.D. 1485. 

10. SALUVA NARASIMHA (A.D. 1485-1490) 

Like most usurpers, Saluva Narasimha found that it was easier 
to capture the throne than to enforce his authority in the kingdom. 
The captains and the chiefs who lent him support in seizing the 
crown were unwilling to submit to his yoke; and consequently, he 
was obliged to fight against his erstwhile supporters and friends. 
Among these the Sambetas of Peranipadu in the Gandikota Sima 
and the Palaigars of Ummattur and Talakadu in the Hoysala -mjya 
deserve special mention. Sambeta Sivaraja offered stubborn resist¬ 
ance, but, as the fortifications of his headquarters Maddigundala 
could not withstand a sustained artillery attack, the fort fell and 
Sivaraja perished with most of his followers at the hands of the 
enemy. 

Narasimha had also to carry on a prolonged fight against the 
Palaigars of Ummattur and Sangitapura who held sway over the 
Mysore district and Tulu-nadu respectively. Though he appears to 


302 


the kingdom of vijayanagara 

have succeeded in imposing his authority over Tulu-nadu during 
the last years of his reign, the chiefs of Ummattur remained un¬ 
subdued until the time of his death. 

The collapse of the BahmanI power in Telingana after the death 
of Muhammad Shah III in A.D. 1482, and the preoccupation of 
Saluva Narasiriiha with preparations for the usurpation of the 
throne of Vijayanagara, left the field open for the ruler of Orissa, 
Purushottama Gajapati, who took full advantage of the situation. 
He seized the coastal Andhra country up to Vinikopda in the Guntur 
district as early as A.D. 1484-85, and then attacked the fort of 
Udayagiri some time after Narasiriiha had usurped the throne. The 
attack was completely successful. According to some accounts, 
Saluva Narasimha, who was in the fort at the time, was taken 
prisoner, and he had to surrender it to the Gajapati as the price of 
freedom. Whether Saluva Narasimha was taken prisoner by Puru¬ 
shottama cannot be verified, but about the loss of Udayagiri, there 
is hardly any room for doubt. 

Saluva Narasimha died early in A.D. 1490. His services to the 
kingdom of Vijayanagara can be hardly over-estimated. It is true 
that he expelled the old dynasty and usurped the throne. But it 
is possible to construe his action in a more favourable light and to 
regard the act of usurpation as due not so much to his ambition 
to sit upon the Diamond Throne as to a desire to protect the Hindu 
kingdom and thereby save the Hindu dharma from the neighbour¬ 
ing Muslim kingdom. With this end in view he befriended the Arab 
merchants and purchased the best horses in the market to improve 
the condition of his cavalry, which, under his successors, contri¬ 
buted a great deal to the military glory of Vijayanagara. He also 
transformed the peace-loving farmers of Vijayanagara into a nation 
of warriors, and taught them how to contend on equal terms with 
the Muslims and the Oriyas on the field of battle. In short, it may 
be said that Saluva Narasiriiha infused fresh vigour into the body 
politic and rescued the State from destruction. 

11. NARASA NAYAKA (A.D. 1490-1503) 

As Saluva Narasiriiha had only two sons who were too young 
to govern the kingdom, he appointed, at the time of his death, his 
minister Narasa Nay aka as the guardian of the princes and the re¬ 
gent of the kingdom, with instruction to hand over the kingdom, 
after the princes had attained majority, to the one whom he consi¬ 
dered more worthy to rule. But, on the death of his master, 
Narasa Nayaka placed on the throne Timma, the elder son, who 
had been holding the office of Yuvardja under his father. As Timma 


303 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


was too young to shoulder the burdens of the State, Narasa Nayaka 
became the real ruler of the kingdom. 

The task that developed upon the shoulders of Narasa Nayaka 
was by no means light. Saluva Narasimha had no time to consoli¬ 
date his position and establish his power firmly at Vijayanagara. 
Though most of the nobles and subordinate chiefs submitted to his 
authority, they showed no disposition to acknowledge the supremacy 
of his sons and allow themselves to be governed by the protector. 
Besides, he had to reckon with the two eternal foreign enemies of 
the kingdom, the Bahmani Sultan and the Gajapati. 

By dint of numerous military campaigns Narasa Nayaka re¬ 
stored the integrity of the kingdom, and the enemies whom he had 
conquered during the thirteen years that he governed the empire 
are enumerated in all the records of his descendants. We learn 
from them that he not only subdued Cher a, Chola, Bandy a and other 
localities in South India, but also defeated the Gajapati, and took 
Adil Khan a prisoner. These claims had a good foundation. 

Reference has been made above to the complete collapse of the 
authority of the Bahmani king about the time when Saluva Nara¬ 
simha died. The king Mahmud Shah was a mere tool in the hands 
of his Prime Minister Qasim Barld, and powerful nobles like Ahmad 
Nizam-ul-Mulk and ‘Adil Khan behaved like independent rulers in 
their own domains. Qasim Barld, jealous of the growing power of 
‘Adil Khan, entered into an alliance with Bahadur Gilani, the ruler of 
Konkan, and Narasa Nayaka, who made a simultaneous attack on 
Bijapur. Narasa Nayaka marched into the Krishna-Tuhgabhadra 
dodb and captured the forts of Raichur and Mudgal. Adil Khan 
was forced to buy peace by ceding these two forts, but as soon as 
he was free from other troubles, he tried to recover them and de¬ 
clared war against Vijayanagara. Narasa Nayaka composed his 
quarrels at home, of which Adil Khan hoped to take advantage, and 
marched with a powerful army to oppose the invader. 

In a battle that took place in the course of the campaign, Adil 
Khan sustained a severe defeat and was obliged to seek shelter 
under the walls of the fortress of Manava. Narasa, who followed 
hard upon his heels, invested the fort and shut out all egress and 
ingress. Realizing his own helpless condition, Adil Khan resolved 
to get rid of him by means of treachery. He invited Narasa and 
the king, as well as the nobles and officers of their court, for a peace- 
conference, and when they arrived, he treacherously attacked them, 
and succeeded in putting most of them to death. Narasa Nayaka 
and his young master effected their escape, but apprehending 


304 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


trouble from his rivals in the capital, Narasa, hurried to Vijaya- 
nagara and left ‘Adil Khan free to subdue the dodb. 

The Gajapati king Prataparudra also led an expedition against 
Vijayanagara and advanced up to the Pennar, but he seems to have 
been defeated and driven back. Narasa Nayaka is credited with 
victory over the Gajapati in all the Tuluva records; and, as the 
boundaries between the two kingdoms remained unchanged, 
Prataparudra’s invasion does not appear to have produced any mate¬ 
rial results. 

But Narasa had numerous internal enemies and they were scat¬ 
tered all over the empire. They included many of the ministers of 
the king and nobles, as well as the dependent chiefs subject to his 
authority. A certain minister, who was not well disposed towards 
Narasa Nayaka, slew king Timma and proclaimed that at the 
instance of the protector his master had been slain, no doubt ex¬ 
pecting that the protector would be put to death for that act of 
treason. To clear himself of the accusation, Narasa immediately 
placed on the throne the younger son of Saluva Narasimha called 
Immadi Narasimha or Dhamma Tammaraya. The new king, how¬ 
ever, turned against the protector and began to show marked favour 
to his rival. Narasa found it difficult to remain in the capital. He, 
therefore, repaired to Penugonda on the pretext of going on a hunt 
and, having gathered forces, marched upon the capital and invested 
it. Immadi Narasimha was obliged to sue for peace and accept him 
as the guardian of his person and the protector of the empire. 
Narasa Nayaka entered the city in great triumph, and his authority 
was established more firmly than ever. In order to prevent the 
king from causing him embarrassment in the future, Narasa, under 
the pretence of securing his safety, kept him under custody at Penu¬ 
gonda and governed the kingdom as if he were its master. 

Next, Narasa Nayaka had to undertake an expedition against 
the chiefs and nobles in the southern provinces. On the death of 
Saluva Narasimha the chiefs of the Chola, the Pandya and the Cher a 
countries seem to have asserted their independence. Narasa 
-defeated them all, captured Madura, and proceeded to Ramesvaram 
at the head of his army. These victories secured him effective con¬ 
trol over the Tamil provinces of the empire. He next turned his 
attention to Western Karnataka, where the Palaigars of Ummattur 
and their allies had raised the standard of rebellion. He captured 
the island fort of Seringapatam, the most important of the rebel 
strongholds, and the Heuna or Hoysala chief, who was the leader 
of the rebels, was taken prisoner. The fall of Seringapatam and the 
capture of its ruler broke the back of the rebellion, and Narasa’s 

305 

D.S.—20 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


authority was as firmly established in Karnataka as in the Tamil 
country. 

Narasa Nayaka was the cle jacto sovereign of Vijayanagara 
during the nominal rule of the sons of Narasimha. He was called 
the rakshdkartd (protector) and svaml (Lord); he held the offices of 
the senadhipati (commander-in-chief), the mahcLpradhiina (Prime 
Minister), and the karyakarta (agent) of the king. The adminis- 
stration of the empire was carried on by him in the name of the king. 
He assumed the royal titles, sat upon the Diamond Throne, and 
was spoken of as Svami (the lord), a form of address usually re¬ 
served for the king. Though Narasa Nayaka imprisoned the king 
and usurped the kingdom, he kept up appearances. The usurpation 
of power by him was justified, as in the case of Saluva Narasimha, 
by the exigencies of the situation. The work, left half accomplished 
by Saluva Narasimha, was continued by him; he practically restored 
the ancient boundaries of the kingdom by reducing to subjection 
all the rebellious chiefs who asserted independence during the last 
days of the Sahgama kings. He found the State in convalescent con¬ 
dition, imparted fresh strength to the body politic, and left it in 
full vigour, pulsating with new life. Narasa died in A.D. 1503, be¬ 
queathing the king and the kingdom to his eldest son, Vira 
Narasimha. 

Narasa Nayaka was a munificent patron of letters, and several 
distinguished scholars and poets flourished at his court. Like all 
his descendants, he fondly cherished Telugu; he invited several 
eminent poets to his court, encouraged them to compose poems, and 
rewarded them richly by liberal grants of land and money. The 
Telugu literature which was intimately connected with the Vijaya¬ 
nagara court since the days of Harihara I and Bukka I, and w 7 as 
fostered by Saluva Narasimha, received a fresh impetus from Narasa 
Nayaka and bloomed forth in great splendour in the time of his more 
illustrious sons. 

12. VIRA NARASIMHA (A.D. 1503-1509) 

Narasa Nayaka v/as succeeded by his eldest son Vira Narasimha 
as the regent of the kingdom. Though the king, Immadi Narasimha, 
was now a prince grown up in years and capable of managing his 
own affairs, the new regent showed no inclination to lay down his 
office and retire into the background. He was, on the contrary, 
resolved to set aside the king and usurp the throne. Feeling that 
the existence of Immadi Narasimha was an impediment to the 
success of his schemes, he caused his ward and master to be 
assassinated in the fort of Penugonda where he was confined, and 


306 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


proclaimed himself king in A.D. 1505. Immadi Narasimha was an 
unfortunate prince whom fate dealt with unkindly. The death of 
his father and elder brother, when he was still too young to grasp 
the reins of government, placed him at the mercy of ambitious men 
who from the beginning plotted against him and ultimately com¬ 
passed his death. He chafed in vain against circumstances but 
gained nothing by it except loss of freedom and death. With him 
ended the brief rule of the Saluva monarchs at Vijayanagara yield¬ 
ing place to a new line of kings under whom the empire rose to great 
magnificence and power. 

Vira Narasimha ruled as the king of Vijayanagara for five 
years. His rule was a period of turmoil. His usurpation of the 
throne evoked much opposition, and the whole kingdom is said to 
have revolted under its nobles. He, however, subdued most of them 
and compelled them to acknowledge his sovereignty. The names 
of all the enemies conquered by him have not come down to us; 
but the most important of them are mentioned in the inscriptions 
and contemporary Telugu literature. 

The first that demands attention was Kacha or Kiasappa U$aiya, 
the chief of Adavani (Adoni), whose authority seems to have ex¬ 
tended from Adavani on the Tungabhadra to Penugonda in the 
Anantapur district. Kacha was not by himself a dangerous enemy, 
but his alliance with Yusuf £ Adil Khan and the possible friendship 
with the rebellious Palaigars of Ummattur made him formidable. 
Ever since his treacherous attack upon Narasa Nayaka in A.D. 1490, 
Yusuf ‘Adil Khan had been making attempts to bring the whole of 
the Krishna-Tungabhadra-dcdb under his sway. At his instance 
the BahmanI king Mahmud Shah persuaded all the assembled nobles 
of his court to join him and wage a religious war on the infidels of 
Vijayanagara. The first jihad, in accordance with the compact of 
Bldar, as it was called, took place in A.D. 1502, the last year of the 
regency of Narasa Nayaka. The Muslim army met with little or 
no opposition. Mahmud Shah conquered the dodb with its two 
famous strongholds, Raichur and Mudgal, and handed over the con¬ 
quered territory to Yusuf £ Adil Khan. The acquisition of the dodb 
Whetted the appetite of £ Adil Khan for more territory, and the 
usurpation of Vira Narasiriiha and the consequent rebellions of the 
nobles against him, offered a suitable opportunity for realizing his 
object. He entered into an alliance with Kasappa Udaiya, the 
governor of the important fort of Adavani on the Tungabhadra, and 
marching at the head of his army into the Vijayanagara territory 
laid siege to the fort of Kandanavolu (Kurnool). The object of 
Adil Khan was probably to capture Kandanavolu, and then effect- 


307 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ing a junction with Hasappa Udaiya at Adavani, proceed against 
Vijayanagara itself along the Tungabhadra valley. ‘Adil Khan, how¬ 
ever, failed to achieve his object. The Arevidu chief, Ramaraja I, 
and his son Timma, whom Vira Narasimha sent against ‘Adil Khan, 
inflicted a crushing defeat on him, and as he was retreating 
hastily towards Adavani, destroyed his forces again in a battle some¬ 
where in the neighbourhood of that fort and expelled him from 
Vijayanagara territory. They next invested Adavani fort and took 
possession of it. Vira Narasirhha, who was immensely delighted to 
see the defeat and destruction of his enemies, bestowed Kandanavolu 
and Adavani on the Arevidu princes as fiefs, and decorated Timma 
with the anklet of the heroes. 

Vira Narasimha next turned his attention to the subjugation of 
the rebels in the Karnata and Tulu districts of the empire. He at 
first besieged the fort of Ummattur but failed to take it. He then 
proceeded against Seringapatam, but the enemy sallied out of the 
fort and inflicted a defeat on the royal forces with the help of the 
chiefs of Ummattur and Talakadu. Vira Narasimha’s attempt to 
force the Karnataka rebels to submit to his authority thus ended in 
total failure. He was, however, completely successful in dealing 
with the rebels on the west coast. Having crossed the Ghats, Vira 
Narasimha reduced the whole of Tulu-nad to subjection and took 
possession of all its ports. He next began to concert measures to 
renew his campaign in Karnataka, but before he could complete 
these preparations, he fell ill and died, leaving the task of complet¬ 
ing his work to his successor. 

Though Vira Narasimha was continuously engaged in warfare 
throughout the short period of his reign, he found time to improve 
the efficiency of his army by introducing certain changes in the 
methods of recruitment and training of his forces. To improve the 
condition of his cavalry, he offered tempting prices to horse-dealers 
and attracted them to Bhatakal and other Tuluva ports which he 
had conquered. The monopoly which the Arab and Persian 
merchants had enjoyed heretofore was effectively broken by the 
Portuguese who bore no love for the Muslims. Vira Narasimha 
sent one of his ministers to Almeida, the Governor of the Portuguese 
possessions, and concluded a treaty with them for purchasing all the 
horses that they imported from abroad. He also recruited all effi¬ 
cient candidates, irrespective of caste or creed, as troopers and 
trainers. Vira Narasimha infused warlike spirit among his subjects 
by encouraging all kinds of military exercises. Men of every social 
rank and profession became thoroughly war-minded, and cowardice 
was condemned as the most disgraceful thing among the Raya’s sub- 


308 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


jects. They delighted in military exercise and flocked to the 
standards of the Raya to fight against the Muslims. 

Vira Narasimha took keen interest in the welfare of the ruyats. 
He was ready to listen to their grievances and alleviate their distress 
as far as possible. One of the important reforms which he intro¬ 
duced to lighten their burden was the abolition of marriage-tax. 
He was only a pioneer in this respect. The reform which he timidly 
introduced only in one or two localities was made applicable to 
almost the whole of the empire by his more illustrious younger 
brother and successor. The credit of initiating this popular reform, 
however, belongs really to Vira Narasimha, though this fact is 
ignored by historians. 

13. KRISHNADEVARAYA (A.D. 1509-1529) 

On the death of Vira Narasimha, his half-brother Krishnadeva- 
raya ascended the Diamond Throne. His coronation was celebrated, 
in all probability, on the Sri-Jay anti day of Saka 1432, correspond¬ 
ing to August 8, 1509. Krishnadevaraya did not succeed to a peace¬ 
ful kingdom. Though Vira Narasimha is said to have destroyed 
all the rebellious chiefs and confiscated their estates, some of the 
Palaigars were still at large, and the authority of the central govern¬ 
ment was by no means effective. Moreover, the Gajapati was still 
in possession of the eastern districts of the empire; and though 
the BahmanI kingdom had ceased virtually to exist, the Muslim 
pressure on the northern frontier had lost none of its old vigour. 
Yusuf ‘Adil Khan, the founder of the ‘Adil Shahl dynasty of Bijapur, 
had been persistently attempting to extend the boundary of his 
kingdom at the expense of the Raya. 

(i) Expedition against the BahmanI kingdom 

At the very outset of his reign, Krishnadeva was involved in 
war with his neighbours in the north and the north-east. The 
BahmanI Sultan, Mahmud Shah, in pursuance of the compact of 
Bidar, and probably at the instance of Yusuf ‘Adil Khan, declared 
a jihad on the infidels of Vijayanagara towards the end of 
A.D. 1509; 21 and he was joined by all the chiefs and nobles who 
nominally acknowledged his supremacy. 

The BahmanI Sultan marched from his capital at the head of 
a vast army accompanied by Malik Ahmad Bahrl, Nurl Khan, Khvaja 
Jahan, ‘Adil Khan, Qutb-ul-Mulk, ‘Imad-ul-Mulk, Dastur-i-Mamalik, 
Mirza Lutfullah and other nobles of lesser importance. When the 
Muslim army arrived at Dony on the Vijayanagara frontier, their 
progress was checked by the Vijayanagara forces. A fierce engage- 


309 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ment took place in which the Bahmani forces suffered a crushing 
defeat. The Sultan himself was wounded and his nobles and captains, 
unable to face the victorious enemy, beat a hasty retreat towards 
Kovelakonda. Krishnadevaraya did not, however, give up the fight; 
he pursued the retreating Bahman! army and forced it to fight 
another battle in the environs of Kovelakonda, which resulted once 
again in a victory to Vijayanagara. The battle of Kovelakonda, was 
more disastrous in its consequences than Dony to the Bahmani 
kingdom. Yusuf ‘Adil Khan who, since the declaration of virtual 
independence, had been fomenting trouble for Vijayanagara, was 
killed in the fight, and the infant state of Bijapur was thrown into 
confusion and disorder. 

Taking advantage of the anarchic conditions prevailing in Bija¬ 
pur, Krishnadevaraya invaded the Krishna-Tungabhadra-dcab and 
captured Raichur (A.D. 1512). He then advanced on Gulbarga, and 
captured the fort after a short siege, having inflicted a severe 
defeat on Barld-i-Mamalik and his allies, who were holding the 
place. He next set out for Bidar in pursuit of Barid, and having de¬ 
feated him once again in battle, captured the fort. Krishnaraya 
then restored Sultan Mahmud Shah to power, and assumed, in com¬ 
memoration of the act, the title of Yavana-rdjya-sthdpan-dchdrya. 
This was not a whimsical step. Krishnaraya was not only a great 
general but a skilful politician. He set the Sultan at liberty and 
restored him to power, because he wanted to weaken his Muslim 
neighbours by throwing an apple of discord in their midst. He 
knew that so long as the shadow of the Bahmani monarchy persisted, 
there would be no peace among the Muslim rulers of the Deccan. 

(ii) Subjugation of Ummattur 

Krishnadevaraya next set out on an expedition against the 
Palaigar of Ummattur, who defied his predecessor and was ruling 
the upper Kaveri valley as an independent prince. The strength 
of the Palaigar lay in his possession of the forts of Seringapatam 
and Sivansamudram, which, situated on islands between two 
branches of the Kaveri, were considered impregnable. Gahgaraja, 
then ruling the principality, anticipated trouble, transferred his 
headquarters to Sivansamudram, and strengthened it further by col¬ 
lecting forces and stocking it with ammunition. 

Krishnaraya’s campaign against Ummattur lasted for nearly 
two years. He first laid siege to the fort of Seringapatam and 
destroyed it; next he proceeded against Sivansamudram and invest¬ 
ed it for more than one year. Unable to withstand the siege longer, 
Gangaraja abandoned the fort and, while fleeing to a place of safety, 
was drowned in the Kaveri. Krishnaraya then captured Sivan- 


310 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


samudram and dismantled its fortifications. He subdued the terri¬ 
tory under the sway of the rebel chief and constituted it into a new 
province with Seringapatam as its headquarters, and having 
made the necessary arrangement to carry on the administration 
returned in triumph to his capital. 

(iii) War with Orissa 

Krishnaraya now felt strong enough to declare war upon the 
Gajapati who had conquered two provinces of Vijayanagara, 
namely, Udayagiri and Kondavldu, which Krishnaraya’s predecessors 
failed to recover. Krishnaraya’s war against Orissa falls into five 
definite stages. 

(a) The war opened with an attack upon the fort of Udayagiri 
in the month of January, 1513. Prataparudra sent a large army to 
relieve it, but Krishnaraya inflicted a severe defeat on the Oriyas 
and pursued them as far as Kondavldu. He now tried to capture 
the fort of Udayagiri by escalade, but failed on account of its in¬ 
accessibility. It could only be reached by a narrow road which 
allowed only one man to pass at a time. As rocks and boulders pre¬ 
vented large bodies of men from approaching the fort, Krishnaraya 
cut the rocky hills and broke down many boulders so that the 
narrow road, which had hitherto been the only means of approach, 
was greatly widened to enable his men to reach the fort. As a 
consequence of these operations, the Vijayanagara forces surrounded 
the fort and erected a wall of circumvallation around it. The Oriyas 
could hold out no longer and surrendered the fort which was lost 
to them for ever. 

(b) After the fall of Udayagiri, Krishnaraya returned to 
Vijayanagara, while the army marched into the Kondavldu province, 
burning the villages and pillaging the country-side. The Oriya 
garrisons stationed in various places abandoned their posts and 
fled in panic to Kondavldu. The forts of Kandukur, Addanki, 
Vinukonda, Bellamkonda, Nagarjunakonda, Tangeda and Keta- 
varam fell rapidly one after another into the hands of the 
Raya. Having completed the subjugation of the forts and 
the territories dependent upon them, the Vijayanagara army pro¬ 
ceeded at last against Kondavldu and laid siege to it. Kondavldu 
was a strong fortress with lofty battlements perched on the top of 
a hill. Owing to the natural strength of the fort, and concen¬ 
tration of Oriya noblemen and their troops in it, Saluva Timma, 
the Vijayanagara general, could not reduce it to subjection, even 
after three months. It was at this stage that Krishnadevaraya 
arrived at the place. The siege operations were pushed on vigor- 


311 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ously. The fort was surrounded and egress and ingress were com¬ 
pletely blocked. Krishnaraya ordered several nada-chcipparams i.e. 
wooden platforms to be constructed, and when they were ready, he 
caused his soldiers to be mounted on them so that they might stand 
on a level with the defenders and fight with them. Krishnaraya’s 
forces demolished the walls of the fort in some places, and ulti¬ 
mately captured it by escalade. A large number of Oriya noblemen, 
including Prince VIrabhadra, the son and heir of the Gajapati, and 
one of his queens, were captured and carried away as prisoners of 
war to Vijayanagara. The fall of Kondavidu was followed by the 
conquest of the coastal region up to the Krishna. 

(c) The army advanced to Bezwada on the Krishna and laid 
siege to the fort. Krishnaraya having joined the army once again, 
the pressure on the fort increased, and, unable to hold out, the 
defenders delivered the keys into the hands of the Raya. He next 
proceeded against Kondapalli situated on the north bank of the river 
at a distance of about ten miles to the north-west of Bezwada. While 
Krishnaraya was engaged with siege operations, the Gajapati 
Prataparudra advanced against him with a large army with the 
object of attacking him in the rear while the garrison of the fort 
would engage him in the front. Krishnaraya left a part of his forces 
around the fort and, with the bulk of the army, marched against 
the Gajapati. While Krishnaraya was attempting to cross a small 
river in the neighbourhood, the Gajapati attacked him but, in the 
engagement that ensued, he sustained severe defeat and sought 
safety in flight. Krishnaraya then returned to his camp under the 
walls of Kondapalli, and captured it after a siege lasting for two 
months. 22 

(d) The capture of Bezwada and Kondapalli was a prelude to 
the conquest of Telingana and Yengi, both of which now formed 
part of the kingdom of the Gajapati. The Velama chiefs dominated 
Telingana in the 14th and 15th centuries, but a certain Shitab Khan 
(i.e. Sltapati) of Bhogikula, who had recently conquered it from 
the Muslims, probably with the help of the Gajapati, was ruling 
over the region. Instead of marching along the coast towards 
Rajahmundry, Krishnaraya turned westwards and reduced at first 
all the forts in the Nalgonda and Warangal districts. Reaching the 
Godavari he turned towards the east and marched along the banks 
of the river towards Rajahmundry. The Gajapati made one more 
attempt to check the progress of the invader. The Vijayanagara 
army had to pass through defiles in the hills. Shitab Khan, at the 
instance of the Gajapati, occupied the passes with 60,000 archers, 
and attacked the invaders fiercely. Krishnaraya commanded his 
cavalry to climb the hills on both the sides and attack Shitab Khan’s 


312 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


men from behind. This manoeuvre produced the desired result. Un 
able to resist this unexpected attack, Shitab Khan’s men fled in con¬ 
fusion, pursued by Vijayanagara forces, until they took refuge in a 
neighbouring fort. Krishnaraya left 30,000 infantry to guard the 
passes and marched forward with his remaining forces. He reached 
Rajahmundry which he captured without difficulty. Then he reduced 
the whole of Verigi to subjection, and having established his autho¬ 
rity in all the cities of the land, he proceeded towards Simhachalam, 
devastating the country all along the route. He set up a pillar 
of victory at Potnur, offered worship to God Simhadrinatha, and 
leaving behind his army there, returned to Vijayanagara. 

(e) Notwithstanding the series of defeats suffered by him, 
and the consequent loss of territory, the Gajapati was not inclined 
to come to terms. Krishnaraya therefore resolved to conquer 
Cuttack, the Gajapati’s capital, and his army advanced to the city. 23 
According to the Rciyavachakam, which gives a fairly detailed ac¬ 
count of the expedition, the Gajapati was induced by a wicked 
stratagem to sue for peace. According to Nuniz, what induced the 
Gajapati to ask for peace was the suicide of his son and heir Vrra- 
bhadra who was in captivity at Vijayanagara. However that may 
be, a treaty of peace was at last concluded in A.D. 1518, according 
to the terms of which, the Gajapati gave his daughter in marriage 
to Krishnadevaraya, and obtained from him in return all the territory 
north of the Krishna conquered by him during the war. Thus 
ended one of the most brilliant episodes in the military history of 
India in the 16th century. 

(iv) War with Quit Qutb Shah of Golkonda 

The defeat and discomfiture of the Gajapati brought into 
prominence a new enemy, the Qutb Shah! ruler of Telingana. QulT 
Qutb Shah was no friend of the Hindus of Karnataka; he was am¬ 
bitious and was desirous of making himself the master of Telugu 
country. While Krishnaraya was busy with his Orissa war, he at¬ 
tacked some of the forts, specially Pangal and Guntur in the Vijaya¬ 
nagara frontier, and conquered them. After his defeat at the hands 
of Krishnaraya, the Gajapati lost his power and prestige, and Quli 
Qutb Shah took advantage of it to wrest from Shitab Khan, men¬ 
tioned above, Warangal, Kambhammet and other forts in his pos¬ 
session. Next he invaded the coastal region, took possession of 
Kondapalli, Ellore and Rajahmundry and compelled the Gajapati to 
cede to him the whole of the territory between the mouths of the 
Krishna and Godavari. After this conquest he could not resist the 
temptation of making inroads into the Vijayanagara territory. Tak- 


313 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ing advantage of the departure of Krishnaraya to Chatuir in order 
to subdue the chief who was in revolt for fifty years, Qull Qutb 
Shah marched at the head of an army to Kondavidu and laid siege 
to the fort. Saluva Timma, whom Krishnaraya had appointed the 
governor of the place, was absent at Vijayanagara, and Nadindla 
Gopa, his nephew, who was in charge of the place, was not able to 
repel the enemy. As soon as Krishnaraya returned to his capital, 
he despatched Saluva Timma, with 200,000 men to Kondavidu to 
drive away the invader. On his arrival at Kondavidu, Saluva Tim¬ 
ma defeated the Qutb Shahi army and took the commander, Madar- 
ul-Mulk, and his officers prisoners and sent them to Vijayanagara. 
He remained in the province for some time, making arrangements 
for its defence and administration, and then returned to the 
capital. 24 

(v) War with Bijdpur 

It has been mentioned above, that Krishnadevaraya captured 
the fort of Raichur from Xsma‘11 ‘Adil Khan in A.D. 1512 during 
his minority when Kamil Khan was the regent of the kingdom. 
Xsma‘11 did not, however, reconcile himself to the loss of the fort 
and, together with it, the mastery over the Krishna-Tuhgabhadra- 
doab. Therefore, when he came to power after the overthrow of 
Kamal Ivhan, he took advantage of Krishnadevaraya’s preoccupation 
with the Orissan and other wars on the east coast, and invaded the 
dodb and captured Raichur. 25 In A.D. 1520, as soon as Saluva 
Timma returned to the capital from Kondavidu, he set out at the 
head of a large army and laid siege to Raichur. Isma‘11 ‘Adil Khan 
hastened towards the dodb with all his forces, crossed the Krishna, 
and established himself in an entrenched camp near the village of 
Gobbur. A fierce engagement took place in which the Bijapurls 
sustained a crushing defeat; large numbers were massacred .and 
many were drowned in the river while attempting to escape. Isma‘Il 
‘Adil Khan fled precipitately from the field, abandoning his camn 
and war equipment to be plundered by the victorious Vijayanagara 
forces. 

The defeat and flight of ‘Adil Khan from the battlefield did 
not end the war. The Bijapur garrison, defending the fort of 
Raichur, did not surrender, but held out obstinately, protected by 
the strong fortifications of the city. Krishnaraya, however, persisted; 
and with the help of a band of Portuguese musketeers in his service, 
he succeeded in making a breach in the outer fortifications. There 
was dismay in the city and people rushed into the citadel for refuge. 
The commandent of the fort, who came out to pacify the people, was 


314 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


shot dead while inspecting the breach caused by the enemy; and on 
the death of their leader the garrison submitted and surrendered 
the fortress. 

As soon as Krishnadevaraya returned to Vijayanagara after 
the capture of Raichur, an ambassador of Isma‘Il ‘Adil Khan arrived 
at his court, protesting against the unprovoked attack, as he term¬ 
ed it, upon his master’s kingdom and requesting that all that had 
been taken from him in the recent war, including the fort of 
Raichur, might be restored to him. Krishnaraya promised to comply 
with ‘Adil Khan’s request, provided that the latter would pay homage 
to him by kissing his feet. On being informed of this, the ‘Adil 
Khan agreed to do so, and it was arranged that the ceremony should 
take place at Mudgal on the frontier between the two kingdoms. 
But when Krishnaraya reached Mudgal, he did not find Isma‘il 
‘Adil Khan there. Enraged at the slight put upon him, Krishnadeva 
crossed the frontier and advanced upon Bijapur to chastise him. 
‘Adil Khan fled from his capital in panic; and Krishnaraya entered 
his enemy’s capital without opposition, and occupied the royal palace 
for several days. Though it was not Krishnaraya’s intention to 
sack Bijapur, the city was considerably demaged by his troops. o The 
Bijapurls, in desperation, drained the two tanks supplying water 
to the city; and owing to the scarcity of water, Krishnaraya was 
obliged to retire from the city and return to his kingdom. 

Isma‘11 ‘Adil Khan made another attempt to come to an under¬ 
standing with the Raya; but the treachery of Asad Khan Lari, the 
lord of Belgaum, whom he had chosen as his ambassador, frustrated 
his attempt. Asad Khan, who volunteered to go on the mission to 
secure the ruin of his rival Salabat Khan who was in „ captivity at 
Vijayanagara, told the Raya that the failure of ‘Adil Khan to meet 
him at Mudgal, as arranged by the former ambassador, was due to 
Salabat Khan’s machinations. Krishnadevaraya, believing the 
treacherous ambassador, ordered Salabat’s execution. After accom¬ 
plishing his real object, Asad Khan fled secretly from the Raya’s 
camp, lest his treachery should be discovered. Krishnaraya, in¬ 
censed at the conduct of ‘Adil Khan’s ambassador, marched at the 
head of his army into the Bijapur kingdom, burning and plundering 
the country-side as he proceeded. He captured FIruzabad and 
Hasanabad, but, when he arrived at the city of Sagar, his way was 
blocked by a large army. A great battle was fought, the Bijapurls 
suffered a crushing defeat, and a terrific carnage ensued. Two other 
sanguinary battles were fought, one at Shorapur, and another at 
Kemba, both in the Gulbarga district, and the Bijapur armies 
suffered defeat. At last Krishnadevaraya reached Gulbarga, and 


315 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


laid siege to the ancient capital of the Bahmams for the second time. 
The enemy troops once again gathered strength and attacked the 
besiegers, but were again defeated. The city was soon captured and, 
in the words of Nuniz, it was destroyed and the fortress was razed 
to the ground. 

Krishnaraya’s victory over Isma‘Il ‘Adil Khan was complete. 
He was personally inclined to continue the war against ‘Adil Khan, 
but, on the advice of the Council of Ministers which he considered 
wise and prudent, he resolved to give up hostilities and return to 
his kingdom. Before he started upon his return march, he placed, 
on the ancestral throne, the eldest of the three sons of Sultan 
Mahmud Shah II, whom ‘Adil Khan had kept in confinement in the 
fort of Gulbarga; and took the other two with him to Vijayanagara 
where he kept them in safety, bestowing an annual pension of 
fifty thousand gold paradaos on each of them. This step was prompt¬ 
ed by motives of policy. The continuance of the Bahmani monarchy, 
even in a shadowy form, was a source of potential danger to the 
stability of the new Deceani Muslim states; and if ‘Adil Khan or 
any other Muslim ruler of the Deccan imprisoned or made away 
with the prince whom he set upon the throne, he held the other 1 
two in reserve to make use of them, as he deemed fit, in any new 
situation that might arise in the future. 

(vi) Rebellion of Saluva Timma (Jr.) 

With the close of the Gulbarga campaign, Krishnaraya’s foreign 
wars came to an end. He would have ruled in peace during the 
remaining years of his reign, but for an untoward incident which 
led to the outbreak of a rebellion in the eastern provinces of the 
empire. Krishnaraya had no male issue for a long time. At last, 
TirumaladevI, his chief queen, gave birth to a son called Tirumala- 
deva-Maharaya in A.D. 1518-19. After his return from Gulbarga, 
Krishnaraya, who was already advanced in years, desirous of ensur¬ 
ing the succession of his young son after his death, abdicated the 
throne, and having crowned the young prince, assumed the office 
of the Prime Minister and carried on the administration in the 
name of the prince. This young prince unfortunately fell ill after 
a reign of eight months and died. After the death of the prince, 
Krishnaraya learnt that the death of his son was due to poison 
administered to him by Timma Dandanayaka, son of his great 
minister Saluva Timmarasa. In his anger, Krishnaraya believed that 
the report he heard about the death of his son was true; he seized 
Timmarasa, his son Timma Dandanayaka, and his younger brother 
Saluva Gundaraja, and immured them in prison where they remain- 


316 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


ed for three years. At the end of the period Timma Dandanayaka 
escaped from prison and, having repaired to Gooty or Kondavldu 
where his cousins Nandendla Appa and Gopa were ruling respec¬ 
tively as governors, set up the standard of rebellion. Krishnaraya 
could not easily suppress the rebellion. The royal forces appear to 
have suffered some reverses. At last Rayasam Ayyaparasa, one of 
the King’s ministers who was sent against him with a large army, 
defeated Timma Dandanayaka and carried him away to Vijaya- 
nagara as a prisoner. Krishnaraya then ordered that Saluva Timma- 
rasa, and his son Timma Dondanayaka should be blinded and sent 
back to their prison. The king’s orders were promptly carried out. 
Timma Dandanayaka died; and his father and younger brother both 
languished in prison. 

(vii) Selection of Achyuta as Successor 

The problem of succession seems to have engaged the attention 
of Krishnadevaraya during the last years of his reign. Though he 
had a son, eighteen months old, and a nephew, the son of his elder 
brother, VIra Narasimha, he passed over both of them because he 
considered that neither was fit to sit upon the throne. Of his two 
half-brothers, Ranga and Achyuta, the former predeceased him, 
leaving behind a son called Sadasiva. He ignored Sadasiva, and set 
free Achyuta from his prison at Chandragiri and selected him as 
his successor. Krishnadevaraya seems to have fallen ill about the 
end of A.D. 1529 and died soon after, deeply mourned by his sub¬ 
jects all over the empire. He was, according to his wishes, succeed¬ 
ed by Achyuta, whose coronation was celebrated early in the next 
year. 

(viii) Krishnadevaraya and the Portuguese 

Krishnadevaraya maintained friendly relation with the Portu¬ 
guese. He found it advantageous to cultivate their friendship, be¬ 
cause it enabled him to secure horses for his army without which 
he could not have waged war successfully on the Bahmani king¬ 
dom. The Portuguese, having defeated the Arab and the Persian 
merchants and destroyed the Egyptian navy, established virtual 
monopoly over the trade in Arab and Persian horses on which de¬ 
pended the strength of the medieval Indian armies. 26 It was of 
utmost importance that Krishnadevaraya should obtain their good¬ 
will and persuade them to sell him all the horses which they im¬ 
ported from abroad. The Portuguese, on their side, were equally 
anxious to secure Krishnaraya’s favour so that they might obtain 
facilities for trade in the numerous towns and cities of the empire. 
With the accession, therefore, of Krishnadevaraya, there ensued a 


317 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


period of intimate intercourse between Vijayanagara and Portugal, 
and large numbers of Portuguese travellers, merchants and adven¬ 
turers flocked to the Hindu capital and sought favours from the Raya 
and his courtiers. In spite of his desire to cultivate the friendship 
of the Portuguese, Krishnadevaraya never lent support to their poli¬ 
tical designs. Though he congratulated Alfonso d’ Albuquerque on 
his conquest of the fort of Goa from the ruler of Bijapur, he de¬ 
clined to enter into an alliance with them against the Zamorin of 
Calicut. When in A.D. 1523, the Portuguese conquered the main¬ 
land near Goa, he sent a small force under his minister Saluva 
Timma against them. The expedition was a failure, and Saluva 
Timma, being repulsed, had to beat a hasty retreat. Krishnaraya 
was not unaware of the fighting qualities of the Portuguese. Why 
he sent against them only a small force, quite inadequate for the 
purpose, is far from clear. Krishnaraya probably had no intention 
to wage war seriously on the Portuguese. He seems to have des¬ 
patched the expedition not so much to effect any territorial con¬ 
quest as to notify his protest against the Portuguese aggressions on 
the mainland. The short interlude of war, however, was soon for¬ 
gotten, and as soon as the war clouds lifted away, normal relations 
of friendship were resumed. 

(ix) Krishnadevaraya as a warrior and general 

Krishnadevaraya was famous both as a warrior and general. He 
believed like most of his contemporaries, that the proper place of 
a monarch on the battlefield was at the head of his forces. His 
prowess was well known; he led his armies personally, fought in 
the front line of the battle, and won the respect of his friends and 
foes alike. He was a great general, who knew how to win victories 
under the most discouraging circumstances. He knew no defeat. 
Whenever he took the command of his armies in person, he was 
uniformly victorious, and he invariably swept away the forces 
arrayed against him on the battlefield. His triumphant armies 
entered the capitals of his enemies, and planted the boar-standard 
on the battlements of Cuttack, Bidar, Gulbarga and Bijapur. His 
success must be ascribed to his capacity for organization and the 
extraordinary skill which he displayed in leading his forces. He 
showed amazing resourcefulness in overcoming obstacles besetting 
his path. He smashed rocks and boulders for making a road for 
his soldiers to reach the fort of Udayagiri, set up movable wooden 
platforms around Kondavidu to enable his men to fight on an equal 
footing with the garrison defending the fort, cut canals to drain the 
waters of a river swollen with floods to seize the stronghold of the 
rebel chief of Chatuir, and put to the sword his own soldiers who 


318 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


turned their backs on the enemy at Raichur, and converted a disaster 
into a brilliant victory. But even more than his personal bravery 
or his skilful management of troops, what enabled him to over¬ 
throw hostile forces was the devotion and attachment of his soldiers 
to his person. Krishnaraya was accustomed, after the conclusion of 
every battle, to go about the battlefield, looking for the wounded; 
he v/ould pick them up and make arrangements to give them medi¬ 
cal help and other conveniences needed for their recovery. Those 
that specially distinguished themselves in the fight were placed 
directly under his supervision so that he might bestow particular 
attention on them and help them to regain their health as quickly 
as possible. The care with which Krishnadevaraya nourished the 
wounded soldiers and warriors did not go unrewarded. It won him 
the affection of the rank and file of his army. The soldiers as well 
as officers were prepared to throw themselves into the jaws of death 
in executing his commands. 

(x) Krishnadevaraya as an administrator 

In spite of his incessant military activities, Krishnadevaraya 
paid considerable attention to the civil administration of the empire. 
The field of the executive authority in a Hindu State was, of course, 
limited by the activities of the local and communal institutions. 
Nevertheless, the Raya and his ministers had much to do by way 
of check and supervision. The maladministration of the provincial 
governors and officials and the capacity of the Amarandyakas de¬ 
manded considerable vigilance. To redress the grievances of the 
ryots and punish the evil-doers, Krishnaraya, following the practice 
of his predecessors, was in the habit of touring the empire of 
Vijayanagara every year, when he came into personal contact with 
his subjects and listened to their complaints and petitions. He took 
considerable interest in constructing irrigation tanks and digging 
canals to provide water for agricultural operations. He also abolish¬ 
ed some of the vexatious taxes such as the marriage fee, and this 
gave immense relief to all classes of his subjects. He ordered 
deforestation in many parts of the country, and augmented the 
revenue of the State by bringing fresh land under cultivation. 

Krishnadevaraya was a great builder. Much of his building 
activity was confined to Nagalapur, a new town founded by him 
near Vijayanagara, where he built many beautiful mansions and 
temples. Besides some temples in the capital, he was also responsi¬ 
ble for the construction of many new structures in the provinces. 
The thousand-pillared mantapas and the raya-gopurams, which 
characterize the country-side in south India, were largely built 
during his reign. 


319 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


(xi) Krishnadevaraya as a patron oj art and letters 

Krishnadevaraya was a munificent patron of art and letters. 
All the famous artists were in his employ to decorate his palaces 
and temples. His fame as a patron of letters spread far and wide. 
He was known as the Andhra-Bhoja, and, true to his name, he 
never failed to load with presents the numerous scholars, poets, 
philosophers and theologians that flocked to his court in search of 
patronage. Though Krishnaraya extended his patronage to the 
writers in all languages, Sanskrit as well as the South Indian verna¬ 
culars, he specially favoured Telugu, and contributed much to the 
development of its literature. The Augustan age of Telugu lite¬ 
rature, which began with the accession of Saluva Narasimha, burst 
forth in full splendour in the reign of Krishnadevaraya, and his 
court became the centre of light and learning in the country. Him¬ 
self a poet, the author of the Amukta-malyada, one of the greatest 
poems in the language, he loved to surround himself with poets and 
men of letters. His literary court was adorned by a group of eight 
eminent Telugu poets called the Ashtadiggajas or the elephants sup¬ 
porting the eight cardinal points of the literary world. Apart from 
his great encouragement to the Telugu poets and men of letters of his 
day, Krishnadevaraya rendered an important service to the cause of 
Telugu literature which had far-reaching consequences. He creat¬ 
ed the ideal of a scholar-king, one of whose important duties was 
to protect poets and men of letters and foster the growth of language 
and literature. It was recognized ever since by all the Telugu 
monarchs that one of their principal duties as rulers was to patro¬ 
nize Telugu poets and learned men and encourage the growth of 
literature. As a consequence, notwithstanding the numerous poli¬ 
tical changes through which the country passed, learning flourished 
without hindrance, and Telugu literature became what it is at pre¬ 
sent, owing to the patronage of the generations of princes and chiefs 
who bore sway over the land.

APPENDIX 


Two problems in connection with the foundation of the king¬ 
dom of Vijayanagara call for a detailed notice. The first pertains 
to the national affiliations of the founders of the Vijayanagara 
empire. Scholars who had hitherto worked on this subject may 
be divided into two groups sharply opposed to each other. Some 
are of opinion that Harihara and Bukka, the founders of the empire, 
were refugees from Tiling, who fled from the court of their sovereign, 
Prataparudra of Warangal, when that monarch was taken prisoner 
by the armies of the Sultan of Delhi. They established themselves 
at Anegondi on the banks of the Tuhgabhadra, and with the help 
of a sage called Vidyaranya laid the foundations of a new city, 
Vijayanagara or Vidyanagara, on the opposite bank of the river. 
This view is based on tradition derived exclusively from Kannada 
sources. Though unsupported by direct contemporary evidence, it 
is not inconsistent and unworthy of credence. Others reject the 
tradition completely and hold that the founders of Vijayanagara 
were Karnatakas, subordinates of the Hoysala monarch Ballala III, 
who were posted to the northern marches of his kingdom to defend 
it against the attacks of Musulmans, a task which they are said to 
have discharged to the satisfaction of their master, and stood forth 
as the champions of the Hindu civilization. On the death of 
Ballala III and his son Ballala IV, they are supposed to have quietly 
ascended the vacant throne, and ruled the erstwhile Hoysala 
dominions without opposition. Though espoused with enthusiasm 
by some eminent South Indian epigraphists and historians, this view 
seems to be based not on facts but on gratuitous assumptions and 
false identifications which need not be discussed here. 

The account given in the Vidyaranya-Kalajndna and Vidyaranya 
Vrittanta may be summed up as follows: ‘‘Harihara and Bukka, 
who were in the service of the Kakatiya monarch Prataparudra as 
the custodians of the royal treasury, fled from Warangal to 
Kampill, when the army of the Sultan of Delhi carried their master 
away to his capital as a prisoner of war, and took refuge with 
Ramanatha, the heroic son of the Raya of Kampill. A few years 
later, when Sultan Muhammad captured Kampill, putting to death 
the Raya and his son, they were taken prisoners and carried 
away to Delhi. The Sultan impressed by their upright conduct, 
soon set them at liberty and, appointing them as rulers of Karna¬ 
taka, sent them over to the South with an army to suppress the rebel¬ 
lion of Ballala and take possession of the country from him. They 
crossed the river Krishna by means of boats, but suffered a defeat 
at the hands of Ballala whom they encountered somewhere on the 
southern bank of the river. They wandered southwards, and met 
the famous sage Vidyaranya at Hampi on the Tuhgabhadra. Follow¬ 
ing the advice of the sage they gathered together a force and, having 
defeated Ballala in battle, they established themselves at Anegondi 
and began to rule the kingdom of Karnataka.” An important detail

left out in these two works is furnished by Keladinripavijayam, 
according to which Harihara and Bukka, during their sojourn at the 
court of Kampillraya, contracted marriage alliances with the 
Kurubas, the tribe to which the Raya himself belonged. 

So much about tradition. The contemporary Muslim historians 
Ziya-ucL-cUn Baranl and ‘lsami brieliy aiiuae to wnat Happened at 
Kampili at ter its annexation by Munammad bin Tugbluq. A rela¬ 
tion ot tne Jtiaya of iAampiii, wiiom tne Sultan appointed tne governor 
ot the province, rose up In rebellion at the time of Kanya (jAapaya) 
Nayaka's attack on Warangal, and having apostatized from isiaim 
declared his independence; he then set out on an expedition ot 
conquest and reduced tiie whole of Karnataka from Gooti to Ma‘bar 
to subjection. This apostate, according to Firishta, was originally 
converted to Islam from Hinduism by Sultan Muhammad himself. 
Inscriptions of tlie period also throw considerable light on the sub¬ 
ject. The earliest record, which demands notice here, is an epi¬ 
graph dated A.D. 1314 from Gozalavidu in the Nellore district in 
the south of the Andhra coastal country, in which Bukka, one of 
the founders of Vijayanagara, is referred to as the ruler of the 
locality. Though this record does not mention any superior to whom 
he was subordinate, the date and the locality where it is found 
clearly indicate that he must have been a subject of the Kakatlya 
Prataparudra whose sway extended all over the east coast down to 
Kanchi in the Tondaimandalam. The inscriptions of Harihara’s 
reign show that he was ruling the territory comprising south-eastern 
Telugu country and the northern Karnataka as an independent 
monarch from A.D. 1336, and that his brother and co-regent, Bukka, 
defeated Ballala IV within a few months of the death of his father, 
Ballala III, in A.D. 1344, and annexed the Hoysala dominions to his 
new T kingdom. 

Now, taking into consideration the evidence of tradition, the 
Muslim historians, and the inscriptions, it may be stated that the 
founders of Vijayanagara were at first in the service of Pratapa¬ 
rudra of Warangal, and that when that monarch was defeated by 
Muhammad bin Tughluq and taken prisoner, they fled to Kampili 
and took refuge in the court of Kampilldeva. They were, however, 
captured by the Sultan after the sack of Kampili in A.D. 1326, and 
were carried away to Delhi where they were forcibly converted to 
Islam. On the outbreak of a rebellion in Kampili and the collapse 
of the provincial government, they were released by the Sultan from 
prison and sent with an army to Kampili to reconquer it from the 
rebels and rule the province as his deputies. This they successfully 
accomplished; but they did not long remain loyal to the Sultan. 
They came under the influence of Vidyaranya who persuaded them 
to renounce Islam, and throw in their lot with the Andhra nationa¬ 
lists who had just then succeeded, under the leadership of Kapaya, 
in expelling the Musulmans and re-establishing their national in¬ 
dependence. Harihara and Bukka then reverted to their ancient 
faith and, having declared their independence, assumed the leader¬ 
ship of the Hindus of Kampili in their fight against the Musulmans. 

The second problem concerns the origin of the city of Vijaya¬ 
nagara. The evidence on the subject is divergent. Tradition, 

322 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


embodied in the Vidydranya-Kdlajndna and works of this descrip¬ 
tion, attributes the foundation of tlie city to Vidyaranya, and Vidya- 
nagara, the alternative name by which the city was known, lends 
colour to the tradition. The inscriptions of Harihara I and his 
successors, which narrate the circumstances in which the city was 
founded, do not at all mention Vidyaranya in this connection. They 
refer either to Harihara I or Bukka i as the builder of the city 
of victory. 27 The conflicting character of the evidence has, no doubt, 
given rise to much speculation; and several theories have been put 
forward to explain the circumstances under which the city was 
founded. Tradition has been, as usual, rejected as utterly untrust¬ 
worthy, and Vidyaranya is treated as a person of no consequence. 
All the inscriptions which refer to the city as Vidyanagara are de¬ 
clared to be spurious, being forged by the wily monks of the Advaita- 
matha at Sringerl. The part played by Harihara I in the construc¬ 
tion of the new city is also discounted; and the credit of building 
it is exclusively given to Bukka I. Such a theory ignores the fol¬ 
lowing facts, clearly established by a careful examination of the 
contemporary records: 

(1) Vijayanagara was functioning as the capital of the new 
kingdom from at least A.D. 1344, some ten years before the death 
of Harihara I; (2) Bukka I was associated with his brother in the 
administration of the kingdom as his co-regent at least from 
A.D. 1344: and ( 3 ) Vidyaranya was the adviser, in spiritual as well 
as temporal affairs, of the first three kings of Vijayanagara, namely, 
Harihara I, Bukka I and Harihara II. It is highly improbable that 
Vidyaranya, Harihar I, and Bukka, who were responsible for the 
foundation and the government of the kingdom of Vijayanagara, 
should have built the new capital without consulting one another. 
On the whole the following seems to be the most logical inference 
from facts known so far on reliable authority: 

The idea that a new city should be built around the Hemakuta 
hill had originated in the mind of Vidyaranya. He commanded his 
royal disciples, Harihara and Bukka, to give material shape to the 
idea. They obeyed his command. Harihara entrusted to his brother 
the task of constructing the city. Accepting the orders of his guru 
and his sovereign, Bukka erected the new city. The testimony of 
tradition and inscriptions is not only not contradictory but comple¬ 
mentary. Vidyaranya supplied the idea; Harihara gave the neces¬ 
sary sanction; and Bukka carried it into execution. The city of 
Vidyanagara was thus built by all the three, Vidyaranya, Harihara 
and Bukka. 28

couplet must have been identical with Ballala IV, as there was no other person 
bearing that name at that time.

6. No other king of Vijayanagara is known to have conquered Sapta-Konkanas. 
This is corroborated by the evidence of Nuniz who states that Ajarao (i.e. 
Harihara II) ‘was always at war with the Moors; and he took Goa, and Chaul, 
and Dabull, and Ceillao, and all the country of Charamamdell’ (Sewell:

after repeated battles, Vijayanagara army from the dominions of the Sultan 
(Briggs, Ferishta, II, 391). This is, however, highly improbable; for in the 
first place, this fact is not mentioned by other Muslim historians; and secondly, 
the ill-will that existed between the brothers since the arrival of GIsu Daraz, 
and the Khan-i-Khanan’s designs upon the throne must have prevented him 
from lending a helping hand to the Sultan. 

10 . Gopinatha Row believes that Vijaya ruled for a period of six months (EL 
XV. p. 14), and Venkoba Rao agrees with him (ARE. 1921 , Part II, para. 48). 
Sewell assigns to him a very short reign of a few months (List. Ins. p. 214). 
Hayavadana Row is more liberal; he increases the period of his rule to two 
years. What is more interesting still is that he cites the evidence of a record 
of the reign of Devaraya II, dated S. 1325 (A.D. 1403-4) to prove that Vijaya 
died in that year (MYS. Gaz. New Edition, Vol. II, pt. iii, p. 1560). The 
record in question (EC, VIII. TL. 163) however has no bearing on the sub¬ 
ject. The donor of the grant registered therein was not Devaraya II but 
Vitthappa Dannayaka, one of his officers, who grants a village to Brahmans 
for the attainment to Sivaloka of his father. 

11. TA, III (Eng. Tr.), p. 44. This is in agreement with Firishta’s account 
(Briggs II, 400). Tabataba places the invasion before Khalf Hasan’s conquests 
in Konkan and the Sultan’s expedition to Kherla to help Narsing Raya (IA, 
XXVIII, 211). 

12. According to the Burhan-i-Ma’asir (BK, 51), Ahmad Shall transferred the 
capital of his kingdom from Gulbarga to Bldar, “in the month of Rajab in the 
second year of his reign (June, 1423)”; but Firishta states that Sultan Ahmad 
Shah laid the foundations of his new capital while returning from his Kherla 
expedition in 830 AH. (A.D. 1426) (Briggs II, 411). In the Tazkirdt-ul-Muluk 
of Rafi-ud-dl ShirazI, it is said that Ahmad Shah, who ascended the throne in 
830 A.H., founded in the very same year his new capital of Muhammadabad- 
Bldar (IA, XXVIII, 218). As Ahmad Shah’s accession took place in 825 A.H. 
(A.D- 1422), he must have shifted his capital from Gulbarga in that year. 
The latest date for the foundation of the new Bahmani capital is furnished by 
Nizam-ud-din Ahmad. Though he agrees 'with Firishta that Sultan Ahmad 
Shah built his capital while returning from his Kherla expedition, he assigns 
its foundation to 832 A.H. (A.D. 1428-29) (TA, Eng. Tr. Ill, 51-53). The evid¬ 
ence is thus conflicting. However as the dates furnished by the Burhdn-i- 
Ma’asir are more reliable than those of Firishta, I am inclined to accept A.D. 
1423 as the correct date for the foundation of the new capital.

Dakshina Suratrana and the Gajapati, both of whom were defeated on a former 
occasion by the latter, came together and invested the city of Vijayanagara. 
Now, the Gajapati who came with the Dakshina Suratrana to invest Vijaya- 


324 


THE KINGDOM OF VIJAYANAGARA 


nagara was Kapilendra. The defeat which he sustained at the hands of Deva¬ 
raya II was inflicted during Mallappa Udaiyar’s expedition in A.D. 1443-44. 
The presence of the Vijayanagara armies in the Godavari delta is indicated 
by an epigraph at Draksharamam dated A.D. 1444, and as the record registers 
a gift for the merit of Mallappa Udaiyar made by a Vira Balanja merchant 
guild at the instance of Allaya Verna and his brother Virabhadra, it is certain 
that he came there to help them ( SII . IV. 1375, Mac. Mss. 15-4-4, p. 164). 

17. 23 of 1905, 476 of 1921, 161 of 1906; EC, III, i, Srirang 107, all dated in A.D. 
1446-47 refer themselves to the reign of Vijaya II. He is also mentioned in 
the inscriptions of the time of Devaraya II. In A.D. 1441 he was holding 
some position of responsibility in the Kondavidurajya (ARE. 420 of 1915). 
Earlier he was ruling in the Rayadurga-rajya from his capital Penugonda. 
According to a copper-plate grant dated A.D. 1435, registering the gift of a 
village made by him to a Vaishnava scholar named Lakshmidhararya, he was 
a younger brother of Devaraya II and was known also as Devaraya, and his 
capital was the city of Ghanasaila (Penugonda). From the fact that the village 
granted was renamed as Pratapadevarayapuram after him, it is certain that 
Vijaya II was also known as Pratapadevaraya (MAR, 1921, Para 62). It is 
interesting to note that, according to the Srlsailam plates of Virupaksha II, 
his father, Pratapadevaraya, who was also younger brother of Devaraya II, 
obtained, from his elder brother i.e. Devaraya II, the Ghandrirajya (Sources, 
No. 26). From this it appears that Pratapadevaraya alias Vijaya, and Pratapa¬ 
devaraya, the father of Virupaksha, are identical. 

18. Further Sources, II, No. 68. 

19. This was probably due to the fact that his great-grandfather Devaraya I had 
the title Praudha prefixed to his name in some of his inscriptions. 

20. See Ch. XIII, B, Orissa, note 8a. for a different view. 

20a. It is generally held that the Gajapati king Kapilendra died in A.D. 1467 
when his son Purushottama ascended the throne (cf. Ch. XIII B). Dr. Ven- 
kataramanayya, the author of this Chapter, who has discussed this question 
at some length in PAIOC, VIII. 585-99, holds the view that Kapilendra ruled 
jointly with his son Purushottama till A.D. 1470 when he died. (Ed.).

Cuttack or not. For discussion of this problem see Further Sources, I, 209- 
211, and P. Mukherjee, Gajapati Kings, 93-95. (Ed.). 

24. A different account of this war is given in the Tdrikh-i-Muhammad Quli Qutb 
Shah, which was written some time after the death of the monarch in A.D. 
1611. This work is utterly unreliable, as it is contradicted by the inscriptions 
of Krishnadevaraya and other indubitable contemporary records. Some of the 
incidents mentioned in the Tdrikh-i-Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah might have 
been based on facts; but the chronology is false. The contemporary evidence 
of Nuniz has greater claim on our credence than the later chronicle.

27. One school of Vijayanagara historians, taking their stand on the statement of 
Firishta that Ballala III built the city, Bijangar. called after his son Bejan 
Ray, near his northern frontier on the way of the armies of Delhi, contend 
that Ballala III was the real founder of Vijayanagara. But, Firishta wrote 
his history in the beginning of the 17th century A.D. His account of Vijaya¬ 
nagara is not authentic and incorporates into it much of the gossip which he 
heard in the bazars of Bijapur. As he relates two stories totally opposed to 
each other about the origin of Vijayanagara, his evidence need not be taken 
into consideration in the present context.

CHAPTER XIII 


INDEPENDENT STATES DURING 
THE SULTANATE OF DELHI 

A. RAJPUT STATES 

The reign of ‘AM-ud-din Khalji (1296-1316) forms an important 
epoch in the history of the Rajputs. Within his lifetime nearly all 
those Rajput kingdoms that had been established on the ruins of 
the Pratlhara empire and had so long withstood the ravages of time 
were one after another annexed to the Sultanate. Thus, so far as 
the Rajputs were concerned, the medieval order might be said to 
have been brought to an end. In its extinction however it laid the 
foundation of the history of modern Rajputana. For, two important 
principalities were shortly founded in Me war and Mar war, which, 
with their offshoots, continued till the present century. It is im¬ 
portant to note that both of these States were ruled by dynasties 
that traced their origin to an earlier period. 

1. ME WAR 

The history of the Guhilaputras till the capture of Chitor by 
‘Ala-ud-dln Khalji in A.D. 1303 has been referred to above. 1 While 
the siege of Chitor was in progress the ruling prince Ratnasimha, 
who belonged to the elder branch of the Guhila family, was dethron¬ 
ed and another member of a junior or Sisodiya branch of the same 
family was proclaimed as the ruler. The prince who thus secured 
the throne in a very perilous moment was Lakshmanasimha, who 
had no other alternative but to die fighting with the enemy in 
defence of Chitor along with seven of his sons. Only one son, Ajaya- 
simha, was allowed to save himself by flight; but so precarious was 
his position that he had to hide himself in the Aravallis and main¬ 
tain a miserable existence. When he died (1314), his elder brother’s 
son, Hammlr, succeeded to his titles. la 

This prince was the real founder of the modern State of Mewar. 
Unfortunately his real history is shrouded in a mass of romantic 
tales. According to tradition, his father Arisimha married a low¬ 
born Rajput woman, who was blessed with extraordinary physical 
strength, and the issue was the hero, Hammlr. That this story has 
no basis in fact is clear from the evidence of Muhanote Nensi, the 
seventeenth century chronicler, who maintains that Hammir’s 


326 


MEWAR 


mother came from the royal Songira Chauhan family, as well as 
from the circumstance that a similar story is narrated in connection 
with another Rajput hero. Even the date of his accession is diffi¬ 
cult to determine from the existing records. But from several con¬ 
siderations it appears very likely that it took place about A.D. 1314, 
It is admitted in all available traditions that his uncle Ajayasimha 
lived for some time after 1303; and it is recorded by Firishta 
that among the incidents of the year 1314 was a vigorous effort 
made by the Rajputs to get rid of the Muslims in Chitor. From what 
we know of Ajayasimha, he could not have possibly made such an 
attempt in which probably are to be traced the hands of a more 
vigorous personality like that of Hammlr. 

Hammir’s initial attempt to oust the Muslims proved a failure 
but it was not wholly ineffective. Khizr Khan, who had been in 
charge of Chitor since 1303, left the place for Delhi and ‘Ala-ud-din 
sent Maldev Chauhan in his stead. According to the Muslim re¬ 
cords, which are generally supported by the Khyat of Nensi, 
Maldev’s administration in Mewar proved a success, so much so that 
on his death in 1321, 2 his son was allowed to succeed to his position. 
Nearly a year previously, the Khalji dynasty had come to an end 
being replaced by the Tughluqs. 

Meanwhile Hammlr did not remain idle. From the notices left 
in the inscriptions, it appears that he proceeded in the task of re¬ 
construction in a most statesmanlike way. The mountain strong¬ 
hold of Kelwara in the Aravallis was his principal headquarters. 
His first attempts were directed towards consolidating his autho¬ 
rity in the neighbourhood. In pursuance of this object he cap¬ 
tured the fort of Jilwara 3 which occupied a position commanding 
the narrow mountain defile that connects Mewar with Marwar across 
the Aravallis. He could now launch his attacks in either directions 
at his will and harass the Muslims both in the Mewar and the 
Marwar regions. The next step was the occupation of the fort of 
Idar in Sirohi 4 which strengthened his position still further. 

He was now in a position to undertake the crowning achieve¬ 
ment of his reign, the recovery of Chitor. Although the later in¬ 
scriptions make no direct mention of this incident, there is no doubt 
that this reconquest of Chitor also be attributed to him. For, 
all traditions unanimously ascribe it to Hammir j while in the 
Eklihgajl inscription of 1429, Hammlr is said to have made certain 
gifts in favour of a temple in Chitor implying thereby the accuracy 
of the traditional account. One may possibly find a clue to the 
silence of contemporary inscriptions in this respect from the facts 
connected with the incident itself. 


327 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


According to Col. Tod, while Maldev was governing Chitor on 
behalf of the Sultans of Delhi, Hammlr began to plunder at random 
the districts under his charge, so that Maldev considered it prudent 
to make an attempt to appease Hammlr by offering him his daughter 
in marriage. The latter accepted the offer and Hammir’s wife help¬ 
ed him to win over Maldev’s officers. Having thus prepared the 
way, it became easy for Hammlr to take the city by a surprise 
attack. Here, as elsewhere, romance is mixed up with facts. 
Maldev’s administration being successful, there was no question of 
his attempt to appease Hammlr by the prospect of matrimony. Again 
there is reason to believe that Hammir’s marriage had taken place 
long before Maldev was placed in charge of Chitor; for, the issue 
of this marriage, Kshetrasimha, died a centenarian about 1405. Al¬ 
though the details about the recapture of Chitor must be regarded 
as fanciful, the fact remains that it was due to treachery inside 
that the city was recovered, and not by any creditable deed of arms 
on Hammir’s part. 

The exact date of this incident cannot be ascertained. It seems 
possible however that it took place during that period of Muhammad 
bin Tughluq’s reign when the latter was involved in widespread 
rebellions in all parts of his empire, that is, after A.D. 1338. The 
story as narrated in the Annals further adds that after the loss of 
Chitor, Maldev’s son went to Delhi and returned to the attack on 
Hammlr with a large Muslim army led by the Sultan “Mahmud 
Khalji” personally. A most sanguinary battle took place at Singoli 
in which the Muslim army was defeated and the Sultan himself 
captured. He had to suffer imprisonment for three months in 
Chitor and was then released on his entering into a treaty with the 
Rana on humiliating terms, such as cession of a number of districts 
and payment of a large war indemnity. Dr. Ojha is inclined 
to accept this story as substantially true, although, in his opinion, 
the name of the Sultan has been given inadvertently as Mahmud 
Khalji in place of Muhammad Tughluq. Apart from the fact that 
the Muslim records make no mention of such an encounter, the 
story must be regarded as inaccurate on other considerations as well. 
The name of Hammir’s opponent, Mahmud Khalji, and the terms 
exacted from him are significant. It will be noticed later in con¬ 
nection with the reign of Rana Sanga (1509-1528), that the latter 
actually defeated and took Sultan Mahmud Khalji of Malwa 
prisoner and released him on the latter signing an ignominious treaty 
the terms of which resemble closely those said to have been ex¬ 
torted by Hammlr. It is clear, therefore, that later chroniclers gave 
Hammlr the credit of an achievement which really belongs to 
Sanga. 4a 


328 


MEWAR 


The uncertainty which clings to many of the activities of this 
hero of Me war also follows him to his death. There is no incon¬ 
testable evidence to fix the end of his life and reign. According to 
at least three different sources, he ruled for 64 years. If, as it has 
been assumed, he began his reign in 1314, his reign must have come 
to an end in 1378. Against this however there are two circum¬ 
stances. Firstly, there is a tradition in Mewar that Hammlr died in 
1364; and, secondly, Dr. Ojha claims to have noticed an inscription 
(which has not yet seen the light of the day) in which Hammir’s 
son Kshetrasimha is said to have been ruling in 1366. Of these 
the first argument is decidedly unacceptable, as the same tradition 
implies that Hammir’s reign began in 1301 which is improbable. 
With regard to the second, it may be said that until the inscription 
itself is published, it would be unsafe to base any theory on its 
contents. The chronology of the period A.D. 1303 to 1420 in the 
history of the Rajput states is extremely difficult to follow. The 
chronicles no doubt are rich in figures, but these are definitely in¬ 
accurate inasmuch as they hardly tally with the evidence of contem¬ 
porary inscriptions. The only way out of this difficulty is to follow 
the latter as well as all synchronistic data whenever available. 
(See Appendix). 

On Hammir’s death his son Kshetrasimha succeeded to the 
throne and ruled for more than a quarter of a century (c. 1378-1405). 
During his reign the work of reconstruction so well begun by his 
father continued uninterrupted, thanks largely to the political situa¬ 
tion prevailing in North India in this period. The Sultanate of 
Delhi had been steadily losing its power since the death of Firuz 
Shah in 1388 and the provincial governors became practically inde¬ 
pendent. The situation was made worse by the invasion of Timur 
in 1398. Thereafter, in place of one strong government North 
India was split up into nearly half a dozen States, each quarrelling 
with its neighbour for authority. It was, therefore, easy for the 
rulers of Mewar to carry on a policy of advancement. 

One of the earlier incidents of Kshetrasimha’s reign was a 
struggle with the Hadas of Bundi. The Hadas were a sub-section 
of the Chauhan clan of Rajputs, the term Hada being adopted after 
a leader bearing that name but coming from the Sohgira section 
of that clan. According to the Khyat of Muhanote Nensi, Hada 
Devisimha gave his daughter in marriage to Arisimha (father of 
Hammlr) and received from the latter the help of a band of soldiers 
by whose help he captured Bundi from an aboriginal people called 
the Minas. It had been already settled that if the venture proved 
i success, DevLsirhha was to acknowledge allegiance to the throne 
of Mewar- This was done. But shortly after, Mewar itself fell

into ‘Ala-ud-dln’s hands and it may be easily surmised that with 
their existence at stake the Me war chiefs were hardly able to en¬ 
force their authority on the Hadas. After the recovery of Mewar 
by Hammir (c. 1340) a clash between Hammir and the Hada sardars 
became inevitable, although for the time being, on account of 
Hammir’s many preoccupations, it was avoided. With the accession 
of Kshetrasiihha, Mewar turned to enforce its former authority over 
Bundi, No less than three inscriptions clearly mention that Kshetra- 
sirhha inflicted a defeat on the Hada sardars, destroyed their fort 
Mandalgadh and brought under his control the Hada lands. 6 

Following close upon this Kshetrasiihha came to be involved 
in a struggle with his neighbour Dilavar Khan Ghurl, ruler of Malwa, 
also known by the name of Ami Shah. 6 Although nominally sub¬ 
ject to Delhi, Dilavar was practically an independent ruler. The 
causes of this conflict are not mentioned, but we can surmise that 
in the steady growth of Mewar, Malwa must have discovered a 
potential enemy. A sanguinary battle took place near Chitor which 
implies that the Malwa ruler was probably the aggressor. Kshetra- 
siriiha however won a victory, thanks to the help given by his 
vassal, the Hada chieftain Mahadeva, as mentioned in the Menal in¬ 
scription of A.D. 1389. 7 

Mewar’s rise to prominence is indicated by the successful wars 
in the eastern and south-eastern frontiers as w'eil as those in the 
south-west. It has been noted already that early in his reign 
Hammir had forced the ruler of Idar (Jaitrakarna) to acknowledge 
him as his overlord. Oil Jaitrakarna’s death, his son, Ranamalla, 
succeeded in Idar but his restless activities brought him into colli' 
sions with Muzaffar Khan, the ruler of Gujarat. In this quarrel liana- 
malia appears to have came out successful. Immediately after, 
however, Kshetrasiihha undertook an expedition against Idar and 
captured Ranamalla. An inscription of A.D. 1460, 8 refers to this 
incident as follows: “Kshetrasiihha threw into prison Ranamalla who 
had been a vassal of Guzerat but who had brought to an end the 
pride of the !&aka ruler”. 

It was after this incident apparently that a second encounter 
between Dilavar Khan Ghuri alias Ami Shah and Kshetrasiihha took 
place. The causes are not clear but it is possible that Kshetrasiihha 
sought to take advantage of a quarrel then going on between Dila¬ 
var and his son (mentioned by Firishta) and take his revenge against 
the Malwa ruler for his attack upon Mewar early in his reign. 
The results were now entirely in favour of Mewar, for, Kshetra¬ 
siihha w T as able to make an end of his enemy once for all, as a 
number of inscriptions definitely maintain. 9

MEWAR 


Not very long after, Kshetrasimha died (c. 1405). According 
to a notice in Rana Kumbha’s commentary on Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda 
he is said to have died a centenarian. 10 He left behind seven legiti¬ 
mate sons besides a number of illegitimate ones, the most notable 
among these latter being Chacha and Mera. 

The eldest of Keshetrasimha’s sons, Lakshasimha or Lakha, suc¬ 
ceeded to the throne of Mewar at a fairly advanced age and ruled 
only for about 15 years till c. 1420. It will be shown later that 
simultaneously with the development of Mewar, another Rajput 
State had been founded by the Rathors in Marwar. Their leader 
Chunda (1390-1422), who was a contemporary of Lakha, thought 
that an alliance with Mewar would greatly help his advancement, 
and accordingly offered the hands of his daughter Hamsabai to 
Lakha’s son and heir, also known by the name of Chunda. The 
extant traditions maintain that the latter refused the offer but the 
old Rana proposed to marry the girl himself. The Rathor chieftain 
was unwilling to marry his daughter to the old ruler, specially as 
any issue born of her person would have no right on the Mewar 
throne. Lakha’s son Chunda now came forward and renounced his 
rights in favour of any issue that might be born of his father’s mar¬ 
riage with Hamsabai. The marriage took place and Hamsabai’s 
brother Ranamalla came to reside in Mewar. It is very likely that 
this incident happened at the beginning of Lakha’s reign; for, 
Ranamalla’s seems to have been the guiding hands in all the acti¬ 
vities of Lakha’s reign of which we have any record. 

One of the most important events of this reign was the dis¬ 
covery of silver and lead mines in a village called Jawar in the 
Magra district of the State. This placed the kingdom on a strong 
economic foundation without which it would not have been possible 
for Mewar to carry on the wars with the neighbouring States in 
the 15th and 16th centuries and at the same time rear up some of 
the most splendid monuments that the country can boast of. With¬ 
out, however, a wise economic policy the influx of bullion would 
have been a great hindrance to the development of the State. 
Fortunately, the guidance of the State was in capable hands. The 
Eklihgajl inscription of 1429 maintains that a better and more 
respectable system of weights and measures was introduced in place 
of the older ones. 11 As a consequence the kingdom attracted many 
foreign traders one of whom constructed that artificial lake near 
Udaipur which is known nowadays as the Pichhola lake. 

In those days help given to pilgrims was considered very meri¬ 
torious. Actuated by this idea the aged Lakha gave relief to the 
Hindu pilgrims that visited the sacred places of Gaya, Banaras 


331 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


and Prayag (Allahabad). These places were then included within 
the territories of the Sultan of Jaunpur who imposed severe taxes 
on such pilgrims, causing great inconvenience to them. The 
Eklihgajl inscription of A.D. 1429 distinctly mentions that Lakha 
gave away money frequently and unhesitatingly to give relief to 
the pilgrims for the taxes imposed by the Muslim sovereign. 12 

When Lakha died (c. 1420), his son Mokal (by the Rathor 
queen Hamsabai) succeeded 13 to the throne. The Mewar chronicles 
maintain that Lakha’s eldest son Chunda, true to his renunciation, 
refused the throne and was one of the first to own his allegiance 
to his younger brother, now sovereign of the kingdom. Chunda how¬ 
ever continued to look after the affairs of the State. This 
was disliked by Mokal’s mother who apprehended that Chunda 
might take advantage of the position to put Mokal out of the way 
and ultimate^ occupy the throne itself. Chunda felt highly morti¬ 
fied and determined to leave Mewar once for all. Having there¬ 
fore instructed his uterine brother Raghavadeva to look after Mokal’s 
interests, Chunda retired to Malwa along with his other brothers. 
On Chunda’s withdrawal, Harhsabai’s brother Ranamalla placed 
himself in charge of the affairs in Mewar, and, with the help of 
the Mewar army, secured possession over the throne of Marwar 
as well as the Muslim principality of Nagaur. During his absence from 
Mewar it was however attacked by the Sultan of Gujarat who ad¬ 
vanced as far as Jilwara. Rana Mokal went forward to meet the 
enemy but was killed by Chacha and Mera who accompanied him 
in this expedition. Mokal died in 1433 and left seven sons, the 
eldest of them being Kumbha. 

The sudden death of Mokal left the kingdom in a most difficult 
position both internally and externally. Within the State, one of 
the assassins of Mokal got himself proclaimed as the Rana and the 
newly acquired districts attempted to free themselves from the con¬ 
trol of Mewar. At the same time the Muslim rulers of Malwa and 
Gujarat also sought to take advantage of Mewar’s troubles. 

For once the alliance with the Rathors proved to be the safety 
of Mewar. When the news of Mokal’s death reached his uncle 
Ranamalla in Marwar, the latter at once came to Mewar with the 
Rathor army, expelled the usurper from Chitor and seated his grand¬ 
nephew Kumbha on the throne. As a result of a series of campaigns 
the conspirators were all crushed. Those who survived took shelter 
in Malwa. A war with the latter, therefore, followed and the 
Sultan of Malwa, having suffered a defeat, was compelled to turn 
the refugees out of his kingdom. The latter then fled to Gujarat. 
Ranamalla followed them there and forced the Sultan to expel them 


332 


MEWAR 


from that kingdom as well. Meanwhile, the Hadas of Bundi also 
had risen in insurrection but they were soon brought under control. 14 

Thus the difficulties of the first five years of Kumbha’s reign 
were surmounted with the help of Ranamalla whose influence 
naturally ruled supreme in Mewar. But this produced further 
complications. According to the Mewar chronicles, Ranamalla’s 
pretensions now knew no bounds. He behaved as if he were the 
Rana and it was believed that he would eventually secure possession 
of the Mewar throne. The Mar war chronicles, however, maintain 
that the Sisodiyas were aggrieved because all authority in the State 
was now vested in Ranamalla. Considering that the constitution of 
the Rajput State was tribal in character, an influence like that which 
was exercised by Ranamalla in Mewar was bound to be regarded as 
revolutionary. This explains why bad blood was created between 
the Sisodiyas and the Rathors. The assassination of Raghavadeva, 
younger brother of Chunda, made that ill-feeling stronger. The 
Mewar chronicles maintain that Raghavadeva had raised a protest 
against Ranamalla and was therefore done to death. On the 
other hand, the Marwar chronicles say that Raghavadeva was respon¬ 
sible for insurrections in the country, and, for the sake of law and 
order, he had to suffer the highest penalty that the law could give. 

The irritated Sisodiyas formed a conspiracy under the leader¬ 
ship of Chunda, who had been in Malwa for a long time past, and on 
an appointed day, some of the conspirators fell upon Ranamalla in 
Chitor and put an end to his life (1438). 

The Annals of Mewar speaks most disparagingly of Ranamalla 
and very highly of Chunda. The former is described as a mean con¬ 
spirator whose eyes were set on the throne of Mewar and who would 
certainly have got the same if the latter had not stood in the way. 
But judged from his actions, it will be found that there was no de¬ 
finite evidence to substantiate the charge of meanness brought 
against him. Rather, he served the Mewar darhdr loyally when it 
was in the midst of its greatest dangers. Again Chunda has been 
held up as a very pattern of filial devotion and fraternal loyalty. 
Modern writers have even compared him with Bhishma of the 
Mahdbhdrata fame for his renunciation of rights to the throne in 
favour of a younger step-brother that was not yet born. A careful 
examination of the events of his life will however dispel many of 
such ideas about him. It has been already noted that when his 
father Lakha married, he had already many sons, besides Chunda, 
by his former wife or wives. When Chunda renounced his rights, 
these devolved upon the next brother. But in this case all the sons 
of Lakha by his previous wives were debarred and the succession 


333 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


passed to an issue by the youngest wife (Hamsabai). It seems to 
have been a ease of disinheriting all of the former in favour of one 
by the latter. From this point of view, the credit that has long been 
given to Chunda loses much in weight. Again, Chunda, after leaving 
Mewar took shelter in Malwa which was then the hereditary enemy 
of Mewar. Besides, during the great troubles which followed the 
assassination of Mokal, Chunda made no attempt to look after the 
interest Gf Mokal’s son, Kumbha, who owed his crown to the much 
hated Ranamalla. 

The assassination of Ranamalla was an event of great significance 
in the history of Mewar and Marwar. For more than a quarter of 
a century the alliance between the Rathors and the Sisodiyas had 
been of great advantage to both the States. All this now came to 
an end and these two clans now entered into that feud which con¬ 
tinued for many centuries. 

In the course of the next seven years we find Mewar engaged in 
a war with the Rathors on the western front and the Sultan of Malwa 
on the south. The story of the latter struggle is given in the Muslim 
records, while some hints are thrown also by contemporary inscrip¬ 
tions. Almost every year the Muslim army would penetrate into 
Mewar, and after plundering portions of the country return to 
Malwa. The result of the war, however, was a drawn one; for, the 
position of the two States continued as before and both the parties 
commemorated their victories by erecting memorials-—the Sultan 
of Malwa at Mandu and Rana Kumbha at Chitor. The latter is the 
famous Kirtistambha or Jayastambha of Chitor built about A.D. 
1448. All this time the feud with the Rathors continued. Here the 
Sisodiyas seem to have been very successful at the outset. The 
whole of the Rathor land including the capital Mandor was occupied 
by the Sisodiyas, and garrisons were established at suitable places 
to hold the country under control. Ranamalla’s son and heir Jodha 
was compelled to leave the country. 

The next eight years were comparatively peaceful. This inter¬ 
val was spent by Rana Kumbha in the construction of a number of 
buildings, temples and forts. In 1456, however, the war broke out 
again. 15 In that year a dispute arose in Nagor or Nagaur (which had 
apparently been reoccupied by the Muslims after Ranamalla’s 
death) over the succession to that principality. One of the 
candidate solicited help from Rana Kumbha who promised the same 
on the condition that the former recognized allegiance to the latter, 
and as a token thereof the fortifications at Nagaur were dismantled. 
The terms were accepted and Kumbha seated his protege on the 
Nagaur principality. But no sooner had his object been gained than 


334 



MEWAR 


the latter refused to comply with the terms. Kumbha had, there¬ 
upon, to undertake a fresh campaign, but this time against his former 
protege. The latter now sought help from Sultan Qutb-ud-dln of 
Gujarat and having offered his daughter in marriage to the Sultan, 
secured the services of a Gujarat army. Kumbha, however, inflicted 
a crushing defeat on the enemy and captured Nagaur. The incident 
is described in a contemporary inscription in the following language: 
“In complete disregard of the ruler of Gujarat Kumbha captured 
Nagor”. 

In the winter of 1455-56, Sultan Qutb-ud-dln came out in the 
open and declared war against Mewar. The Gujarat army was 
divided into two parts. While one section, led by the Sultan in per¬ 
son, crossed the Aravalli hills and advanced as far as the fort of 
Kumbhalgarh, another section was despatched against Sirohi where 
a relation of the Rana was ruling. According to the Muslim records, 
the latter suffered a heavy defeat and the Sultan returned to Gujarat 
after entering into a truce with the Rana. The real situation was 
that on account of the failure of the Sirohi expedition, the Sultan’s 
communications with his kingdom were endangered and he was 
forced to enter into terms with the Rana. Thus the campaign was a 
failure. 

While engaged on the western frontier, the Rana had also been 
involved in a war in the south and the east. Sultan Mahmud Khalji 
of Malwa now sought to take advantage of the difficulties of Mewar 
in order to satisfy his old grudge against that State, but without 
success. Early in 1456, however, an offensive alliance against the 
common enemy was planned by the Sultans of Malwa and Gujarat 
and a treaty to that effect was solemnly signed at Champaner. Its 
objects are thus described by the Muslim historians: “To direct their 

efforts against Rana Kumbha.Mahmud should assail him on 

one side and Qutb-ud-din on the other.they would utterly 

destroy him . divide his country between them . all 

the towns lying contiguous to Gujarat were to be attached to the 
kingdom of Qutb-ud-dln, while the districts of Mewar and Aheerwara 
should be retained by the Malwa forces.” 16 

The odds against Mewar seemed to be overwhelming, specially 
as the Rathor leader Jodha took the opportunity to join the Muslims 
against her. At the same time, within the State, a strong faction 
under Kumbha’s younger brother Kshema was also in arms against 
the Rana. 

In accordance with the arrangement mentioned above, the 
Muslim armies took the field in the winter of 1456-57. Qutb-ud- 
dln occupied Sirohi, plundered the Kumbhalmer district and then 


335 






THE DELHI SULTANATE 


turned to Chitor. The Rana came out to give battle. According to 
one authority, the Rana was defeated and took shelter in the fort; 
but, according to another, the result was indecisive. All Muslim 
writers however mention that the Rana offered money to Qutb-ud- 
dm who thereupon withdrew to his own kingdom. The position of 
the Rana may be understood from the fact that he had been simulta¬ 
neously attacked by the Sultan of Malwa as well. The latter had 
devastated certain parts of Mewar and then attacked Ajmer without 
success. Thereupon he fell back on Mandalgarh where the Rana 
attacked him. The result of the battle is thus described by Firishta: 
“The Malwa officers persuaded their king of the necessity of retiring 
on account of their reduced numbers and the wretched state of the 

camp equipments. Thus the Sultan was induced to 

return to Mandu”. As Col. Briggs says, “The drawn battle men¬ 
tioned must be deemed a defeat”. 17 

No sooner had the enemies retired than Kumbha attacked them 
in his own turn. The districts of Sirohi and Nagaur were recover¬ 
ed from the Sultan of Gujarat, while some pillage at the cost of 
Malwa also took place. In 1457-8, therefore, the Muslim allies again 
took the field. Qutb-ud-din 18 , after capturing Sirohi, advanced as 
far as Kumbha! gar h, but being unable to take it by assault returned 
to his own kingdom. Muslim authorities admit that Mahmud 
Khalji’s campaign did not fare better. As mentioned already, while 
Kumbha was struggling against the Sultans of Gujarat and Malwa, 
he was involved in a war with the Rathors to which references will 
be made later. 

It is unfortunate that no detailed account of the above strug¬ 
gles is available from the Rajput point of view. Contemporary 
inscriptions and other records refer to them only cursorily, so that 
no connected story can be made out of the same. Thus the Kum- 
bhalgarh inscription of 1460 merely says: “Kumbha churned the 
ocean-like armies of the Sultans of Malwa and Gujarat.” In other 
words Kumbha claimed a complete victory over these two Sultans. 

By 1459, the most difficult period of Kumbha’s life was over; 
and the last ten years, in spite of the quarrel with his brother 
Kshema, seem to have been more peaceful. 

Kumbha was one of the greatest rulers of medieval India. When 
the records of his reign that lie scattered in more than sixty inscrip¬ 
tions and many other sources have been fully worked out into a 
comprehensive and connected account, Kumbha will be found to 
occupy a place in no way inferior to the greatest of the contemporary 
sovereigns, Hindu or Muslim. The most astonishing feature of his 
life was that though more than two-thirds of his reign were spent 


336 



MEWAR 


in warfare, he could still find time to devote to the cultivation of 
arts and literature as well. The erroneous belief that the Rajput 
ruler was a mere fighting animal is sure to be dispelled by a clear 
appreciation of this aspect of his achievements. A contemporary 
manuscript called the Eklingamahatmya credits him with proficiency 
in the Vedas, Smritis, Mimamsa, Upanishads, Vyakarana, politics 
and literature. This is fully supported by what is left of his own 
activities as a man of letters. He wrote a commentary on Jaya- 
deva’s Gltagovinda and an explanation of the Chandlsatakam. For 
his knowledge of dramatic art and literature he has been described 
as the new Bharata. He wrote four dramas in which he is said to 
have made use of four provincial languages. He was also highly 
proficient in music, and wrote three works on the science of music 
called Sarigitamga, Sangitamimamsti and Suraprabandha. Under 
his patronage his architect Mandana wrote a number of works some 
of which were on iconography, some on house-building and some on 
house decoration. The same Mandana’s brother, Natha, and his son 
Govinda also wrote a number of works on architecture. Consider¬ 
ing that most of his life was spent in warfare, it was but natural that 
he should take particular interest in strengthening the defences of 
the country. He is thus said to have built as many as 32 out of the 
34 forts in Mewar. He surrounded the citadel of Chitor with a 
number of bastions and built a cart-road with seven gates from the 
foot of the hill, on which the citadel stood, up to its summit. In 
1458 was laid the foundation of a new fort at Kumbhalgarh. Be¬ 
sides the defensive works, he was responsible for the construction 
of a number of temples and wells with arrangements for drawing 
water. Mention may be made of the Kirtistambha already referred 
to, and the temples of KumbhasvamI and Adivariaha. The temple of 
Ekliiigaji having been partially destroyed, Kumbha rebuilt it with 
the addition of an annexe called Kumbha-mandapa. The example of 
the ruler was imitated by the people. The beautiful Jain temples 
at Ranpur and Sirohi as well as the exquisite Sringar Chauri temple 
at Chitor were also executed in Kumbha’s reign, but by private 
individuals. 

The end of Kumbha’s life was very unfortunate. According to 
Nensi’s Khyat, which is supported by contemporary inscriptions, 
Kumbha became insane at the close of his life. One day, as he was 
seated by the side of a tank in Kumbhalgarh, his eldest son, Udaya, 
attacked him with a dagger and put him to death. Impatience 
to occupy the throne seems to have been the only cause of this nefa¬ 
rious deed. The parricide was not, however, allowed to enjoy the 
throne for long. The Rajput nobility in the State turned against 
him, and although according to custom every nobleman had to attend 

337 

D. S.—22 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the darbar on the accession of a new ruler to the throne, they re¬ 
frained from showing this customary respect to their ruler. Udaya 
must have found himself without a strong support in the State and 
sought to enlist in his favour the assistance of the neighbouring 
rulers by cessions of territories which made him still more odious to 
his people. The result was a conspiracy among the noblemen who 
proposed to depose him and place his younger brother Rayamalla on 
the throne. The latter, who had been placed in charge of the fort 
of Tdar, came to Chitor on the invitation of the noblemen, who, taking 
advantage of a timely absence of Udaya from the capital, took it into 
possession and proclaimed Rayamalla as their ruler. Udaya took 
shelter in Kumbhalgarh, but assisted by the noblemen Rayamalla 
soon captured it, Udaya saving himself by flight. 19 

The reign of Rayamalla covers a period of 36 years and falls 
into two parts. The first part comprises the period 1473-1500 and 
is connected with the consolidation of the State. The second part, 
comprising the last nine years, is mainly occupied with civil 
dissensions in the same. 

The brief reign of Udaya seems to have disorganized the whole 
State and naturally the first years of Rayamalla’s reign were spent 
in the task of bringing order out of the chaos. The troubles came 
from three quarters. In the first place there was a civil war. It 
has been already noted that Kumbha had a younger brother, Kshema, 
who was a lifelong enemy of the former. Kumbha’s death and the 
troubles of Udaya’s reign gave Kshema an opportunity to rouse him¬ 
self into action. But Rayamalla proved equal to the occasion. In 
a battle that took place at Dadimpur, Kshema was killed, and thus 
the trouble from that quarter was, for the time being, surmounted. 20 
Secondly, there was a renewal of the conflict with Mialwa. The 
contemporary Sultan of Malwa, Ghiyas-ud-dln Khalji (1469-1500) 
had inherited the quarrel with Mewar from his father, Mahmud 
Khalji. He now bestirred himself, specially as Mewar seemed on 
the verge of dissolution, and advanced as far as Chitor, where a most 
sanguinary battle took place. The Sultan was however defeated and 
Mewar saved. In this battle a hero, Gaura by name, displayed 
unique valour and killed a number of the enemy with his own hand. 
As a tribute to his memory, one of the bastions on the Chitor fort 
was named after him and four statues of the hero were set up 
at four prominent places on the same. 21 The third difficulty 
came from the aboriginal tribes some of whom took the oppor¬ 
tunity to rise into insurrection. But, as the contemporary 
inscription says, Rayamalla successfully carried his soldiers into 
their mountain strongholds and forced them to submit. 22 


338 


MEWAR 


For a second time the Sultan of Malwa returned to the attack 
of Mewar. The Muslim army led by a general called Zafar Khan 
advanced as far as Mandalgarh where Rayamalla met and defeated 
him. The above inscription says: “Rayamalla crushed the army 
of Zafar Khan near Mandalgarh and lowered the head of the Saka 
King Ghiyas, which had been raised in arrogance.” This was follow¬ 
ed by an invasion of Malwa. The Rajput army occupied the district 
of Kherwara and levied contributions from some parts of that 
kingdom. 

Hardly had peace and order been re-established in Mewar by 
these successes than it became the scene of a quarrel among the sons 
of Rayamalla. According to Col. Tod, Rayamalla had several sons 
of whom the first three, in order of seniority, were Sanga, Prithviraja 
and Jayamalla. Though heir apparent, Sanga declared that he 
would forego his birth-right and abide by the verdict of the Charani 
who lived in Nahra Magna. Accordingly, the brothers went there, 
accompanied by their paternal uncle Surajmalla. The Charani 
declared that the kingdom would belong to Sanga with a portion to 
Surajmalla. No sooner was this said than Prithviraja and Jaya¬ 
malla attacked Sanga and Surajmalla. Although severely wounded, 
the latter were able to save themselves by flight. A critical exami¬ 
nation of independent evidence reveals some interesting facts. 
Firstly, from the testimony of Nensi’s Khyat as well as contemporary 
inscription it appears that Prithviraja was the eldest of Rayamalla’s 
sons and therefore heir apparent to the Mewar throne. Secondly, 
Saiiga’s collaborator, Surajmalla, was the son of Kshema who had 
fought against, and died at the hands of, Rayamalla early in the reign. 
If the story of the civil war, which undoubtedly took place, is 
examined in the light of the above facts, it will be found that the 
struggle which Sanga made against Prithviraja in alliance with an 
enemy of his father was nothing but an act of high treason. It was 
all the more serious as there is evidence to show that very likely 
the rebels took the help of Naslr-ud-dln Khaljl of Malwa, and invited 
him to undertake a simultaneous invasion of Mewar. It was for¬ 
tunate for the State that it had the services of a strong man like 
Prince Prithviraja at its disposal. The enemies were defeated and 
Sanga was forced to leave the State. 23 

It looked as if the gravest danger to the State was over. Un¬ 
fortunately how T ever one bereavement after another clouded the last 
years of Rayamalla’s reign. First of all, Prince Prithviraja, who 
carried on the burden of administration in this period, met with an 
untimely death. 24 He had an altercation with his brother-in-law, 
the ruler of Sirohi, who, stung by an insult, poisoned Prithviraja. 


339 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The next brother, Jayamalla, now became the heir apparent. But 
he quarrelled with Rai Surthan of Badnor and died at the hands of 
one of the latter’s relatives. The death of two sons one after another 
came as a severe shock to the aged Rana who turned insane. The 
third of Rayamalla’s sons, Jayasiriiha by name, now received instal¬ 
lation as the heir apparent. But according to the Khyat of Nensi 
he was found incompetent and the noblemen were unwilling to have 
him as their ruler. They sent for Sanga, and having deposed Jaya- 
simha, gave him the crown, Rayamalla dying in the meanwhile. 

The new ruler Sanga was born in 1482. He was thus 27 when 
he ascended the throne in 1509, and he died at the age of 46 in 1528, 
after a reign of 19 years. Not only was Mewar now the most power¬ 
ful of the principalities in Northern India, it was even possible for 
its ruler to make an attempt on the imperial throne of Delhi. 
Several causes account for this unique position attained by Mewar. 
In the first place, since the accession of Hammlr, the kingdom had 
the good fortune to produce a succession of intelligent and strong 
rulers. It was also fortunate that on account of the timely dis¬ 
covery of valuable mines within the kingdom, the rulers did not lack 
the economic resources which are indispensable for all progress. In 
addition to this we have to remember that since the last quarter of 
the 14th century the central authority in Delhi had been gradually 
losing its position, and its power had been usurped by half a dozen 
provincial governments, none of which was strong enough to keep 
the rulers of Mewar under control. Above all, there was the per¬ 
sonality of the new Rana. 

That Sanga was ambitious is clear from the fact that even in 
his father’s reign he made a bid for the throne against his elder 
brothers. But he had also the cleverness to use all opportunities 
that lay in his way to realize his ambition. 

His reign of 19 years falls into two parts. The first 15 years 
were taken up with the consolidation of Mewar’s position. This 
was done by a number of successful wars against his neighbours. 
Shortly after his accession, Sultan Nasir-ud-din of Malwa died and 
a struggle for the throne took place among his sons. After a while 
one of them, Mahmud Khalji by name, secured the throne, mainly 
with the assistance of a Rajput chieftain, MedinI Rai. Naturally 
Medini Rai’s influence now ruled supreme in the State to the great 
dislike of the Muslim noblemen and of Mahmud Khalji. Ultimately 
Mahmud fled to Gujarat and appealed to Sultan Muzaffar of Gujarat 
who, thereupon, came and invested Mandu, the capital of Malwa, 
then occupied by Medini Rai’s son. Medini Rai himself turned for 
assistance to the Rana of Mewar and “represented that in Hindusthan 


340 


MEWAR 


there was no man better than him and that if he did not assist his 
own race who else was to do so?” The Rana consented to advance 
as far as Sarangpur, but said that afterwards he would act as 
circumstances would require. 

t i 

Accordingly, Sanga advanced to Sarangpur. Thereupon the 
Sultan of Gujarat, having sent a detachment of his army to intercept 
the Rana, pressed on the siege of Mandu which ultimately fell into 
his hands in 1518. Finding that there was now no necessity for 
further advance, Sanga retraced his steps to his own kingdom, 
accompanied by Medini Rai who entered the Rana’s service. Mean¬ 
while, after the occupation of Mandu and the fall of Medini Rai’s 
party in Malwa, Mahmud Khalji’s hopes revived, specially as the 
Sultan of Gujarat left a part of his army in Malwa to help him in 
case of difficulty. The idea of teaching the Rajputs a lesson now got 
the better in Mahmud’s mind and he attacked the district of Gagraun 
in 1519. But his expectations were completely belied. The Muslim 
historians themselves maintain that as many as 30 officers in the 
Muslim army were killed and the Sultan himself fell a prisoner into 
Sahga’s hands. He was then taken to Chitor where he had to stay 
for six months. 25 At the end of this period, he was allowed to return 
to his own kingdom after he had signed a treaty on the following 
terms:—(1) payment of a large war indemnity, (2) surrender of a 
gold cap and a belt which were considered as heirlooms by the 
Malwa ruling family, (3) despatch of a son of Mahmud Khaljl to the 
Mewar darbar as a pledge of the future good relation of the Malwa 
Sultan to the latter. In lieu of these terms Mahmud Khaljl was 
left in the possession of those parts of Malwa which belonged to him 
before the outbreak of the present war. 

While Sahga’s relations with Malwa were thus being brought 
to a conclusion in every way satisfactory to the Rana, those with 
Gujarat were also receiving his attention. Since the accession of 
Sanga, the two States were being gradually involved in a quarrel 
over the problem of succession on the throne of Sirohi and the 
troubles in Malwa. The relations with Malwa have just been 
described. In Sirohi two cousins claimed the throne and while one 
of them appealed to the Sultan of Gujarat for help, the other 
married a daughter of Sanga and naturally received his assistance. 

Thus indirectly, Mewar and Gujarat were being drawn into a 
position which was sure to lead to an open struggle; it was pre¬ 
cipitated by an insulting conduct on the part of an officer of Sultan 
Muzaffar of Gujarat. All Muslim historians maintain that in 1520, 
a Muslim officer in idar, incensed at the remarks of a wandering 
minstrel who had asked him to beware of Sanga, caused a street 


341 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


dog do to be named ‘Rana Sanga’ and kept it chained at the gates of 
Idar city. When the information reached the Rana, he immediately 
attacked Idar and plundered the country-side. He then with¬ 
drew into Mew^ar, proposing to undertake a large expedition as 
soon as possible. On this occasion he attacked Idar with his whole 
force and compelled the Muslim officer to take shelter in Ahmad- 
nagar. The Rana followed him there, and in a battle that took place 
near the gates of that city, the Muslim army was again defeated and 
Ahmadnagar fell into Sangla’s hands. 

These events led to a war between the kingdoms of Mewar and 
Gujarat. Sultan Muzaffar at first proposed to undertake personally 
an expedition against Mewar, and prepared a large army for the 
purpose in December, 1520. After some consideration, however, he 
changed his mind and sent the expedition in charge of an officer 
called Malik Ayaz who was to be helped by two other officers. In 
the spring of 1521, the army was set in motion and after plundering 
Dungarpur and Banswara laid siege to Mandasor which lay at the 
southern frontier of Mewar. Meanwhile, Sanga also had advanced 
to its relief and encamped with his army about 12 kos from the in¬ 
vested place. By this time Mahmud Khaljl of Malwa had also joined 
the Gujarat army in the hope of satisfying his vengeance against 
Mewar. 

As far as we can judge from the Muslim accounts of the Rana’s 
activities, it appears that he had three objects in view, namely, to 
strengthen himself by collecting reinforcements, to win over as 
many of the enemy as possible, and to take full advantage of the 
ill-feeling that prevailed among the Muslim officers. It was an open 
secret that the officers who had been sent to co-operate with Malik 
Ayaz were not in a mood to do so, as they looked upon the Malik’s 
appointment as commander-in-chief as an act of supersession of their 
just claims. But time was an essential factor for the achievement 
of Sanga’s threefold objects. Hence he began negotiations with 
Malik Ayaz who directed the Rajput agents to his sovereign, Muzaf¬ 
far. The real motive of the Rana may be gathered from the remarks 
made by Firishta:—“connected with the overtures there were cer¬ 
tain conditions which were extravagant”. 26 During the interval, 
Sanga collected a large army and won over Mahmud Khaljl by pro¬ 
mising to release the latter’s son kept as a hostage in Mewar since 
1519. 27 Meanwhile, the ill-feelings between the Muslim officers of 
Gujarat increased with the progress of time, so much so that when 
the negotiations fell through, they began to quarrel among them¬ 
selves as to which one of them should lead the first attack on Manda¬ 
sor. The bitterness among the Muslim officers reached such serious 


342 


MEWAR 


proportions that Malik Ayaz retired with his contingent from the 
campaign, which thus ended in failure. 

Naturally, Sultan Muzaffar felt deeply offended, and he planned 
another campaign against Mewar to be led by himself. 28 Accord¬ 
ing to the Muslim authorities, 29 when the news reached Sanga, he 
was so greatly unnerved that he despatched a member of his own 
family with valuable presents to appease the Sultan and concluded 
a treaty with him accepting all his terms. Unfortunately, the terms 
are not mentioned, and the general statement is hardly credible in 
view of the antecedents of Siahga. 29a 

The fact seems to be that the Rana was desirous of coming to an 
understanding with the Sultan, for about this time he came to be 
involved in a quarrel with the Sultan of Delhi which needed his 
freedom from entanglements elsewhere. In 1517 the throne of 
Delhi had passed to Ibrahim Lodi who was, however, faced by a 
rebellion led by his younger brother with the help of a number of 
noblemen in the kingdom. After two or three years of warfare the 
rebellion was crushed and the noblemen brought under control. It 
seems that Sanga took advantage of this situation to enhance his own 
position at the cost of the Sultanate. But as soon as Ibrahim’s hands 
were free, he undertook an expedition against the Rana who how¬ 
ever defeated the former in a battle near Dholpur. This failure, 
however, prompted the Sultan to undertake another expedition on 
a large scale. 30 Three of the best officers of Delhi were put in charge 
of a huge army which penetrated into Mewar, and Sanga came for¬ 
ward to meet it. While the Delhi army was within the Rana’s 
territory, Sultan Ibrahim, intending to punish one of the officers, 
Husain Khan, for the part he had taken in the late rebellion, sent a 
secret order to the chief commander, Mian Makan, to take the former 
into custody and despatch him to Delhi. Husain Khan suspected 
foul play and leaving the Muslim camp joined Rana Sanga along with 
his own adherents. Shortly after, the Rajput army attacked the 
enemy which was decisively beaten, Husain Khan remaining neutral. 
Many Muslim officers were killed and Mian Makan was compelled to 
take to his heels, closely pursued by the Rana’s men who drove him 
back as far as Bayana. According to one Muslim authority, this so 
alarmed Sultan Ibrahim that he advanced from Agra to the place 
in order to encourage his people. Immediately after the victory 
Husain Khan fell treacherously on a section of the Rajput army, and 
having captured a few elephants and horses made good his escape. 
These trophies he presented to the Sultan who took him back into 
favour. 

Sahga’s success against Ibrahim Lodi was the crowning achieve¬ 
ment of his career. It was the culmination of a series of successes 


343 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


against his neighbours, as a consequence of which the boundaries of 
Mewar were considerably extended. On the north they were 
pushed up as far as the Bayana river. In the east, Raisen, Kalpi 
and Chanderl were included within her territories. In the south, 
Dungarpur and Banswara were held by a vassal, and her frontiers 
ran far into the heart of Malwa. To the south-west, Sirohi was 
ruled by the Rana’s son-in-law. Even the chiefs of Mar war and 
Ambar, according to Tod, acknowledged his allegiance. But the 
significance of his successes was more than the mere annexations of 
lands, large as they were, would indicate. In getting the better of 
his rivals, Rana Sanga had secured for himself the leading position in 
Northern India, and, in inflicting a crushing defeat upon the occupant 
of the imperial throne at Delhi, he advanced a claim upon that throne 
itself. It marks the beginning of Mewar’s imperial ambition. During 
the years that followed (1523-28), Sanga sought to materialize this 
ambition both by diplomatic means and military efforts. 

It was probably after his success against Sultan Ibrahim that 
Sanga proposed to Babur a simultaneous expedition against Ibrahim 
Lodi. 31 Babur was to move against Agra from Kabul and Sanga 
from his own kingdom. Apparently Sanga was determined to 
bring about the annihilation of the Sultan and, to ensure it, invited 
Mughul help. But it is clear from Sanga’s later conduct that it was 
not his intention to admit Babur as a co-sharer in the assets of the 
Sultanate, which he hoped to secure for himself. 

Babur tells us that, in accordance with this arrangement, he 
left Kabul, conquered the Punjab and obtained a decisive victory 
over Ibrahim Lodi at Planipat (April, 1526). Yet Sanga showed no 
signs of accomplishing his part of the engagement. Sanga’s inacti¬ 
vity, which was the subject of complaint by Babur, was partly ex¬ 
plained by the fact that he was at the time involved in fresh troubles 
in Gujarat. But it was perhaps also due to other considerations if 
we may judge from his later conduct. He might have either thought 
that like previous Mongol invaders, Babur would leave the 
country after he had collected sufficient booty; or, that the Mughuls 
and the Lodi would fritter away their strength in a long struggle, 
making it easier for himself to establish influence over Delhi. It 
will be seen later that all such hopes, if there were any, were ulti¬ 
mately frustrated. 

In Gujarat, the Sultan, Muzaffar, lay on his death-bed and there 
was a scramble for succession among his sons. One of them, Baha¬ 
dur, unable to achieve his object, left Gujarat, came to Mewar and 
then went to Delhi. Meanwhile, Muzaffar died and his eldest son 
Sikandar Khan secured the throne. But more insurrections followed 


344* 


MEWAR 


till at last Sikandar was killed in 1526 and a younger brother pro¬ 
claimed Sultan by a party of noblemen led by ‘Imad-ul-Mulk. His 
supreme influence in the kingdom disgusted another party which in¬ 
vited Bahadur and offered him help to secure the crown. ‘Imad-ul- 
Mulk’s position was extremely precarious and he began to seek for 
outside help. Accordingly, he sent one agent to Rana Sahga pro¬ 
mising him a large sum of money in lieu of his assistance. Another 
emissary, despatched by him to Babur requesting him to send a 
force down the Sindhu 32 to help him, reached the Mughul Emperor 
after the battle of Panipat. 33 An interesting light on Sahga’s policy 
is thrown by Firishta, who mentions that “the communication (sent 
by ‘Imad-ul-Mulk to Babur) never reached its destiny having been 
intercepted by the ruler of Dungarpur”, v/ho, it will be remembered, 
was a vassal of the Rana. Apparently, Sahga had by this time found 
that Babur meant to stay in India and was thus to prove a great 
hindrance to his imperial scheme. It was therefore necessary that 
Babur must be crushed before he could strengthen his position still 
further with the help of allies in the country. Sahga’s policy was 
settled. He helped the exiled Gujarat prince Bahadur to secure the 
throne of Gujarat. 34 By this stroke of policy an alliance between 
Gujarat and Babur was prevented and its place taken by another 
set up between Mewar and Gujarat which continued to be the most 
deciding factor in the politics of western India for the next five 
years (1526-31). At the same time preparations for the encounter 
with Babur were sped up so that hardly six months had passed since 
the battle of Panipat when alarming news reached Babur of Sahga’s 
activities against him. 

The Rajput army was in fact marching rapidly in the direction 
of Agra. On the way a detachment was left to press the siege of 
Kandahat where a partisan of Babur held out, but the main army 
crossed the river Banganga and took the road to Agra. Babur also 
had been busy collecting his army, and by the end of February 1527 
reached Fathpur Sikri. Near this place skirmishes between the ad¬ 
vanced parties of both sides often took place, and, on one occasion 
a party of 1500 of Babur’s men was destroyed by the Rana’s soldiers. 
On the 16th of March, the Rajput army attacked the entrenched posi¬ 
tion of Babur near the village of Khanua. This proved to be the 
most fateful battle of the 16fh century in which the Rajput army 
suffered a complete defeat at Babur’s hands. According to Babur 
himself, the Rajput army numbered about 2 lakhs of soldiers “calcu¬ 
lated according to Hindu fashion”, while he had with him not more 
than 15,000 men. Smith thinks that Sahga had 80,000 horse and 
500 elephants. The defeat of the incomparably larger Hindu army 
by the smaller Muslim one has given rise to speculations ever since. 


S45 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Some attribute the Hindu defeat to the weakness of the Hindu 
soldiers as compared with the Mughul. Some again explain it by a 
treachery in the Hindu ranks, and Col. Tod refers to a tradition that 
Silhadi, an important Rajput general, stood aloof with his men while 
the battle was in progress. Neither of these views, however, appears 
to be correct. Babur himself admits that the Rajput was no mean 
adversary; while the treachery of Silhadi was only an invention of 
much later time. Actually, we find that Silhadi continued to help 
Mewar loyally long after the battle and was one of the trustiest 
officers of Sahga’s son and successor, Ratnasimha. 

The real causes of the Rajput failure may be gathered from the 
following circumstances. Firstly, there was consolidation and com¬ 
pactness in the Muslim army while there was lack of both in the 
Rajput army. Babur had with him only 15,000 soldiers, but the}' 
were all of one mind and determined to follow Babur to any ex¬ 
tremities. He did not allow the half-hearted Indian allies to stay 
with him but sent them to different places on one pretext or another. 
On the other hand, Sanga’s army was huge in shape but wanting in 
solidarity. Babur says that the Rana had “collected a rabble-rout 
of whom some wore the sacred thread on them (i.e. were Hindus), 
some had in their skirt the throne of apostasy (i.e. were Muslim)”. 
Besides, “the Rajas and Rais of high degree who obeyed the Rana 
in this battle as well as the governors and commanders who were 
amongst his followers in this conflict had not obeyed him in any 
earlier fight or out of regard to their own dignity been friendly with 
him”. Clearly, therefore, Sahga’s army was made up of two sections— 
Hindu and Muslim. The Hindu leader looked forward to the esta¬ 
blishment of his own power in Delhi, the Muslims to the re-establish¬ 
ment of the Afghan empire. Moreover, within the Hindu section, 
excepting the Sisodiyas, the other clans were, much against their 
clan interests, compelled for the time being to follow Sahga’s leader¬ 
ship. Their hearts were not in the task, and in fact when the battle 
was over, each of the different Rajput clans departed for its own 
home, as if they had been happily rid of a powerful overlord. Sanga 
failed to awaken a feeling of national unity in the minds of the 
huge host he led. It was his own personality that formed the only 
slender bond of union. Unfortunately, however, in the course of the 
battle he was wounded and had to be carried off the field, and with 
his departure vanished all hopes of success. 

Another no less important cause of Sahga’s failure was to be found 
in the tactics used by him in the battlefield. His object was to over¬ 
whelm the enemy by the sheer weight of numbers and with his 
elephants. As Babur says: “The Hindus moved forward relying 


346 


MEWAR 


on the mountain-like demon-shaped elephants”. But Babur had 
taken sufficient precautions against such tactics. He had caused 
trenches to be dug around his position, to strengthen which still 
more, strong carts had been placed in front of his line and chained 
with one another. Behind these defences he placed matchlockmen 
ready to ply the enemy with showers of bullets when they drew 
near. When, therefore, Sanga’s elephants came forward they were 
smitten by fire-arms and, while retreating, trampled upon the Hindus 
themselves. Into the gaps thus formed, Babur sent his mobile forces 
to convert the defeat into a rout. The battle of Khanua was the 
turning point in the history of India. It put an end to the dream 
of re-establishing a Hindu empire in Delhi and removed the chief 
obstacle to the foundation of the Mughul Empire in India. 

After the battle Babur advanced and took possession of Bayana. 
His plan of continuing the campaign against Safiga had to be aban¬ 
doned for the time being on account of the heat of the approaching 
summer. But as soon as the climatic condition was favourable, at 
the end of the year, Babur again set out in his campaign. His idea 
was to conquer the outlying possessions of Mewar such as Chanderl, 
Raisen, Bhilsa and Sarangpur, and then march against Chitor. Chan- 
deri was accordingly captured about the beginning of 1528, but be¬ 
fore the expedition could be further pursued, Babur found it neces¬ 
sary to postpone it. There was a rebellion in Bihar among the Af¬ 
ghan noblemen which had to be crushed before it assumed serious 
proportion. 

Meanwhile, Safiga had not given up everything for lost. From 
contemporary Rajasthani songs as well as Muslim records, it ap¬ 
pears that he was preparing for another contest with Babur. Abu-’l- 
Fazl tells us that the Rana even invested the fort of Irij where he 
was opposed by a Muslim general. Failing to take the fort, Sanga 
retreated to his own kingdom to die at the comparatively early age 
of forty-six. 

II. MARWAR 

The period which witnessed the gradual advancement of the 
Sisodiya State of Mewar also saw the establishment of the Rathor 
States of Mar war and Bikaner which, until recently, occupied a pro¬ 
minent position in Rajputana. The modern Rathors claim descent 
from the Gahadavalas of Kanauj and Rajput traditions almost uni¬ 
versally support this claim. But as Dr. Hoernle 35 pointed out long 
ago, this claim rests upon no strong foundation; rather, evidence 
indicates that there was no connection between the two. Firstly, 
the Rathors call themselves only by that name and never as Gahada- 


347 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


valas, while in the inscriptions of the latter family the only name 
used is Gahadavala. Secondly, the gotras of these two families are 
different. And, lastly, the Rathors intermarry with the Gahada- 
valas. No satisfactory answer to these arguments has been so far 
put forward, yet the tradition of a connection between the Rathors 
and the Gahadavala kingdom has been so strong that recently Ojha, 
while accepting practically the force of Dr. Hoernle’s contentions, 
has expressed the opinion that the Rathors must have been the des¬ 
cendants of Rashtrakutas of Badaun. 35a 

• • 

The clue to the solution of the problem is to be found in the 
inscription of Siha, 36 founder of the Rathor family of Mar war, dated 
A.D. 1273, where Siha is described as a Rathada. This inscription 
was discovered in a place called Bithu in Marwar. Very close to 
this place lies Sirohi where a pillar was erected in. A.D. 1241 37 by 
a person who calls himself Rathauda, and a piece of land granted in 
1217 38 by another person who describes himself as Rathauda of 
Hathiumdi. That the two last-named persons belonged to the same 
family is indicated by the similarity of the two surnames, Rathauda 
and Rathauda, as well as the fact that these two persons lived in 
the same locality. It is further to be noted that this family was 
known as Rathauda or Rathauda family of Hathiumdi or Hasti¬ 
kundi, a place which lay in the Bijapur district of Jodhpur and very 
contiguous to Sirohi. At Hastikundi again three inscriptions of a 
Rashtrakuta family were discovered containing dates a little over 
two hundred years earlier, showing that it ruled over that region 
during c. A.D. 915-c. 1000. 39 This family is known to historians as 
the Rashtrakutas of Hastikundi. Clearly enough, two descendants of 
this family set up the inscription of A.D. 1217 and A.D. 1241 respec¬ 
tively. The resemblance of the family surname Rathada with the 
designations Rathauda and Rathauda; the proximity of the places 
where the persons with these designations lived; and the nearness 
of time of the three prove that the three terms Rathada, Rathauda 
and Rathauda are only different forms of the same name. And since 
the two latter are decidedly descendants of the tenth century Rash¬ 
trakutas, the former must also be regarded as such. 

As in the case of all noted founders of dynasties, a mass of tra¬ 
ditions have gathered round the name Siha, and it is impossible to 
reconcile these traditions with one another. The only reliable in¬ 
formation is furnished by the Bithu inscription mentioned above, 
which says—“On Monday, the twelfth day of the dark fortnight in 
Karttika 1330 V. S., Rathada Slha, son of Sri Seta Kumara, died. 
May the bliss of Indra’s heaven be for Salanki Parvatl”. Salanki 
Parvatl became a Sati on her husband Siha’s death in A.D. 1273. 


348 


MARWAR 


/ 


The fact that even after his death the only description of Siha was the 
family surname Rathada, with no Maharaja or Raja added thereto, 
clearly indicates that in his life Siha had not been able to secure for 
himself an independent position. Hence all traditions about his 
conquests must be regarded as unreliable. 

Siha’s son was Asthan and the latter’s son Dhuhada. 40 An 
inscription of this last-named prince has been discovered at Tirsing- 
harin in the Pachbhadra district of the Jodhpur State. It is a memo¬ 
rial stone which shows that Dhuhada died in A.D. 1309 in the above- 
mentioned place. It is to be noted that while his grandfather died 
at Bithu, Dhuhada himself died in the Pachbhadra district which is 
very close to Kher, near the southward bend of the Luni. Now, 
tradition maintains that Dhuhada’s father Asthan took advantage 
of a quarrel between the Gohil chief of Kher and his Brahmana 
minister, and with the help of the latter expelled the former and 
made himself master of the place. It seems likely therefore that ii 
was Siha’s son Asthan who established the family in this new site. 

The history of the Rathor family in the fourteenth century is 
involved in obscurity. The Khyats 41 supply us with lists of princes 
who flourished in the family together with their dates and accounts 
of their activities. Thus, we are told that after Dhuhada, Rayapala, 
Kanhapala, JalansI, Chhado, Tido, Salkha and Mallinatha, each 
the son of the preceding one, occupied the Rathor gadi. But, it is 
impossible to make out a connected history of this period for several 
reasons. Firstly, the traditions cannot be reconciled with each 
other. Secondly, the dates given are demonstrably inaccurate. And, 
lastly, according to the above order of succession, seven or eight 
generations of princes ruled for only 80 or 90 years, which is some¬ 
what unusual. Hence, Ojha rejects the genealogy of the Khyats as 
inaccurate, and holds that possibly, rulers who are stated to have 
stood in the relation of father and son actually belonged to the same 
generation. 

Leaving aside details, the general features in the development 
of the Rathor principality are not, however, difficult to follow. The 
Rathor family, after it had been established in Kher, was guided by 
a natural impulse towards expansion. This involved it in a struggle 
with its neighbours, among whom were the Muslims and the Bhattis. 
By the first decade of the fourteenth century, the greatest of the 
Delhi Sultans, ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl (1296-1316) had conquered the 
whole of the eastern part of modern Mar war and Gujarat. It was 
about this time that the Rathors secured possession of Kher, but 
this petty State found itself encircled on three sides by the mighty 
Muslim power. A struggle for its very existence was thus inevitable; 


349 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


and if we study the accounts given in the Khyats we actually find 
many anecdotes regarding the struggle between the two. Thus of 
the Rathor princes of this period as many as five are mentioned as 
having encounters with the Muslims. Kanhapala, Jalansi and Tido 
died at their hands while Salkha and Mallinatha probably saved them¬ 
selves by accepting Muslim hegemony. It should be remembered 
that for the greater part of the fourteenth century (A.D. 1296-1388), 
the throne of Delhi was occupied by three prominent rulers—‘Ala- 
ud-din Khaljl, Muhammad bin Tughluq and Firuz Shah. It was 
impossible for the Rathor State to make any headway as long as the 
Sultans were strong. The decline of the Sultanate must have 
afforded a unique opportunity for expansion to the Rathors, and we 
find this to be actually the case. 

While in the south, east and north-east, the Rathors were con¬ 
fronted by the Muslims, the rising Bhatti state of Jaisalmer sought 
to prevent their advancement to the north-west. The records of 
Rathor activities mention struggle with the Bhattis as well. Thus, 
Kanhapala, Chhado and Tido are mentioned as having continued a 
feud against the Bhattis. 

It appears therefore certain that the fourteenth century was a 
period of struggles on all sides of the Rathor State and undoubtedly 
some of the Rathor princes died at the hands of the enemy. If all 
this be remembered we may possibly find an explanation of the 
circumstance that the average reign in this period was not more 
than 10 or 11 years. Besides, in addition to the external struggles, 
there were internal dissensions in the Rathor family. 

According to the Khyats , Tido died at Muslim hands, leaving 
two sons, of whom Kanhada succeeded to his father’s titles, while 
the other son Salkha received only an appanage. On Kanhada’s 
death, his son TribhuvansI was raised to the throne, but Salkha’s 
son Mallinatha contested the same. A feud between the cousins 
followed and Mallinatha, with Muslim help, secured possession of 
the Rathor principality. Its seat of power was now transferred to 
Me wo, close to Kher. The elder line was thus supplanted and autho¬ 
rity passed into the hands of Mallinatha who adopted the title of 
Rawal. 

With Mallinatha’s accession the Rathor principality definitely 
enters into an era of progress. The whole region on both sides of 
the Luni came into his hands and is still known by the name of 
Mallani. The Khyats indicate that though he had secured power 
with Muslim help, he was able later to renounce Muslim allegiance. 
His success against the Muslims is commemorated in numerous 
songs still current in Marwar which describe how he brought away 


350 


MARWAR 


perforce the daughter of his Muslim enemy. It should be remembered 
that after Flruz Shah’s death in 1388 the Sultanate of Delhi had 
fallen into weak hands and this was the most prominent factor that 
accounts for the Rathor success. 

According to the rules of hereditary succession, Mallinatha 
should have been succeeded by his own son. Such a son was there 
and his descendants are still to be met with in Marwar. But he 
was ousted by a junior member of the Rathor family just as Malli¬ 
natha had done with the descendants of Kanhada. Apparently the 
lesson of Mallinatha’s rise to power was too good to be lost upon 
other ambitious members of the family. Mallinatha had a younger 
brother named Viramjl who quarrelled with Mallinatha’s son and 
heir apparent, Jagmal, and was compelled to leave the State. There¬ 
upon he lived the life of an adventurer till his death in 1383 in a 
skirmish with the Johyas, according to an inscription of 1658. This 
Viramji had a son called Chunda with whom begins a new chapter 
in the history of the Rathors in Marwar. 

As usual the Khyats supply many accounts about Chunda, but 
the details and the dates are difficult to reconcile with each other. 
Yet the main features are beyond dispute. At his father’s death 

Chunda was a minor. He was then taken to his uncle Rawal Malli- 

• • 

hatha, who took him into favour and allotted a small jaglr for his 
maintenance. As time went on, Chunda consolidated his position and 
ultimately, when Mallinatha died, supplanted the latter’s son on the 
Rathor throne. Thus, once more the right of primogeniture was set 
aside in favour of higher capacity and attainments. The next 
important achievement of Chunda’s life was the capture of Mandor 
which had been for the last eight centuries 42 a seat of Pratihara or 
Parihar power. The Parihar ruler had been dispossessed of his 
principality by the Muslims some time ago. Now the Rathors and 
the Parihars combined and their joint efforts were crowned with 
success. Mandor was recovered and the Muslims driven away. But 
as regards the fate of Mandor, the Khyats do not agree. According 
to the Jodhpur version, the Parihar chieftain married his daughter 
to Chunda and handed over Mandor as dowry to his son-in-law; but 
according to the Bikaner tradition, Chunda killed the Parihar ally 
and made himself master of Mandor. Considering that the Jodhpur 
tradition is likely to pass over the shortcomings of its rulers, the 
latter version seems more acceptable. After the occupation of 
Mandor, Chunda transferred his capital here from Mewo. Within 
50 years, his grandson, Jodha, founded a new city within eight miles 
of Mandor. This city, called Jodhpur after its founder, continued 
till recently to be the capital of the Rathors of Marwar. 


351 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Chunda had also entered into a matrimonial alliance with the 
Sisodiya family of Mewar—an incident which shows that he possessed 
more diplomatic talents than are to be found in an average Rajput. 
From the accounts available, it appears that the initiative in this mar¬ 
riage alliance came from the Rathor darbar and that in order to secure 
the alliance of the iSisodiyas, the Rathor ruler did not shrink from 
marrying his young daughter Hamsabai to the aged Rana Lakha. 
It was a great diplomatic achievement, for henceforth the resources 
of Mewar were at the disposal of the Rathor family which was there¬ 
by able to establish its authority strongly in Mar war. Partly on 
account of this alliance, and partly due to the decline of the Delhi 
Sultanate, Chunda ventured into a policy of definite aggression. He 
attacked and for a time held the Muslim principality of Nagaur. He 
had however created many enemies on all sides by his restless acti¬ 
vity; so that the Mohils of Audint and the Bhattis of Pugal joined 
hands with the aggrieved Muslims and challenged Chunda. He was 
killed, according to the Khyats, in 1422, and the Muslims recovered 
Nagaur. 

Chunda had several wives and through them a numerous 
progeny. From the orthodox point of view, Ranamalla was the 
eldest of Chunda’s sons, but Chunda desired that the issue of his 
favourite wife should succeed him. Accordingly, he asked Rana¬ 
malla to renounce his rights in favour of his step-brother Kanha. 
Ranamalla followed the will of his father, left the State altogether 
and came to reside in Mewar where he received a jagir from his 
brother-in-law, Rana Lakha. Meanwhile, Kanha ruled Mandor and 
after his death his younger brother Sata succeeded. Sata was 
practically blind so that his son Narabad looked after the admini¬ 
stration. Sata had a younger brother, called Ranadhira, who after 
a quarrel with his nephew Narabad went to Ranamalla in Mewar 
and pursuaded the latter to return to Mandor. Ranamalla came at 
the head of the Mewar army and took possession of the Marwar 
throne from Sata. 

The above official version, however, cannot stand a close scru¬ 
tiny. Throughout the story Ranamalla is held up as an embodi¬ 
ment of filial respect like his contemporary, Sisodiya Chunda. 
Really, however, it is doubtful whether he had any rights to re¬ 
nounce. His acceptance of jdgir at the hands of Rana Lakha and 
his settlement in Mewar seem to indicate that he was not looked 
upon as having any claims on the Rathor throne. Besides, it has 
been said on his behalf that since his renunciation had been in 
Kanha’s favour, he was within his rights when he wrested the crown 
from Sata. This argument also must be regarded as hollow when 


352 


MARWAR 


it is remembered that Kanha left issues called Kanhavats. 43 If 
Ranamalla had been really a disinterested person, he should have 
taken up the struggle on their behalf and not made himself ruler 
instead. 

The truth is that after Chunda’s death, his sons who successively 
occupied the throne of Mandor were Kanha, Sata and Ranamalla. 
In ]ater times when the chronicles were compiled, the shortlived 
princes intervening between Chunda and Ranamalla were regarded 
practically as usurpers and a sort of legality was imparted on Rana¬ 
malla, the de facto ruler. 

Ranamalla seems to have secured the throne of Mandor in 1427. 
For the next 10 years he was the most influential person in Raj- 
putana as the strings of the policy of Marwar and Mewar lay in his 
hands. Ranamalla used this influence in undertaking an expedition 
against the Muslim ruler of Nagaur who had been partly responsible 
for the death of his father Chunda. It met with complete success. 
The Muslim ruler was killed and his lands occupied. As the expe¬ 
dition had been a joint one between Mewar and Marwar, the annexed 
lands were also divided into tv/o parts and to the share of Marwar fell 
Nagaur and adjoining districts. During the next few years, Rana¬ 
malla introduced in Marwar a number of salutary reforms in the 
system of weights and measures similar to those which had already 
been done under his influence in Mewar. But Marwar could not 
long profit by his presence. In 1432, his nephew Rana Mokal was 
killed. This brought Ranamalla again in Mewar and thanks to his 
endeavour Mokal’s son Kumbha secured the throne. The new ruler 
was young and not yet out of difficulties and therefore Ranamalla 
must have felt his presence in Mewar necessary. But his presence 
in and influence over the State raised against him the ill-feeling of 
the Sisodiya sarddrs who brought about his assassination in Chitor in 
1438, as mentioned above. 

At the time of Ranamalla’s death his son Jodha was also in 
Chitor, but his father had just managed to pass a note of warning, 
so that Jodha fled in hot haste towards Marwar, closely pursued by 
the Sisodiya sarddrs. Thus began that long feud between the two 
clans that lasted for centuries. 

Jodha could not at first make any stand against the Sisodiya 
invasion. Rathor lands were occupied and Sisodiya garrisons were 
established at important places to hold the country under subjec¬ 
tion. Jodha was compelled to take shelter in the thal or desert and 
from his hiding places sought to recover the paternal lands, but 
without effect. About this time however there took place a change 
in the inter-state politics in Western India, which offered an opportu- 

353

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


nity to the Rathor chieftain. The relations between Mewar and 
Malwa had become strained and ultimately led to an open war 
which began about 1443 and lasted till about 1448. After a truce 
of eight years, the war was renewed; but on this occasion 
the Sultans of Gujarat and Malwa were in alliance against Rana 
Kumbha of Mewar. This phase of the struggle lasted till about 1458. 

The Rathor Khyats maintain that Jodha obtained important 
successes against Mewar during this period. The Sisodiya sarddrs 
were driven away from one position after another. Thus Choksi, 
Kosano, Mandor, Sojhat, Merta and Ajmere fell into Rathor hands. 
Ultimately in 1459 he was able to lay the foundation of the modern 
city of Jodhpur. The Rathor Khyats naturally give all the credit of 
this success to their ruler Jodha and do not at all mention that 
the enemy was simultaneously involved in struggle with Gujarat 
and Malwa. But a study of the Muslim accounts along with those 
in the Rathor Khyats leaves no doubt that Jodha took advantage of 
Mewar’s struggles with the Muslim States and was in alliance with 
the latter against Mewar. It was a policy that was suggested by 
the circumstances. Besides, it is interesting to note that while Rathor 
Khyats maintain that on one occasion Jodha carried away the gates 
of the city of Chitor as trophies, the Muslim historian of Gujarat 
ascribes the same achievement to the Sultan of Gujarat. Hemmed 
in by the enemies the Mewar ruler was compelled to follow the 
policy of creating a division in their ranks. In 1458, therefore, 
a treaty was made with Jodha. According to the Mewar chronicles, 
it was through the intercession of the dowager Rani Hamsabai, who 
requested Kumbha not to put her grand-nephew Jodha to greater 
difficulties, that very lenient terms were offered to the latter. In 
the light of what has been said above this version cannot be regarded 
as embodying the whole truth. 

The first 20 years of Jodha’s reign (1438-58) form an interest¬ 
ing landmark in the evolution of the Rathor State which was gradu¬ 
ally assuming its modern shape. Throughout this period, but more 
specially during the next 30 years (1458-1488), another aspect of 
Rathor history also came more and more into prominence. This 
was the dispersal of the Rathor princes in various directions and 
the foundation of new principalities by them. Two factors helped 
this process—the extraordinary fecundity of the ruling family and 
the opportunities offered by the political situation of Western India 
in general and Rajputana in particular at that time. 

Jodha had seventeen sons and it was not possible to secure for 
each one of them an appanage within the State itself. Hence the 
younger princes sought to acquire contiguous lands and effect settle- 


354 


MARWAR 


ment therein. Thus one of his sons, Satal, captured the lands near 
Phalodhi and founded an estate called after him Satalmer. Another 
son, Bika, occupied Nagaur and founded the city called Bikaner after 
himself. Still another, Duda by name, occupied Merta and his 
descendants ruled there under the name of Mertia Rathors. It is 
difficult to ascertain how far these activities were due to the princes 
themselves or to the help rendered them by the central authority. 
Two facts are however clear. These princes occasionally received 
help from the central authority, especially in times of difficulty. 
Secondly, at least some of the conquests were made under the 
auspices of the central government which placed the conquered 
territories under the control of some members of the family. It 
seems clear that the bond between these daughter settlements and 
the mother-State was very uncertain and therefore caused troubles 
in the future. It was quite likely that these settlements might claim 
full independence or, on the contrary, the mother-State might 
insist upon a full authority over the former. For the time being, 
during the period of early development, these problems did not arise. 
But they were sure to arise in the future, and fifty years later they 
formed the most vital ones for the State. 

The necessities of Rathor family thus helped the develop¬ 
ment of the States; still it would not have been possible without 
the aid of contemporary political condition. The place of a strong 
Sultanate in Delhi was now taken by half a dozen smaller princi¬ 
palities which were all engaged in wars of aggression. To ambitious 
young men as the Rathor princes were, no situation could have been 
more welcome. 

During the next forty-four years (1488-1532), the throne of 
Jodhpur was occupied by three princes—Satal (1488-1491), Suja 
(1491-1515) and Ganga (1515-1532). Two important features mark 
the history of this period, namely, struggle for succession, and at¬ 
tempts made by the central authority to exercise control over the 
other branches of the family. 

The death of Jodha in 1488 was followed by a struggle among 
his sons for succession. This was due to several circumstances. 
Firstly, the rules of succession were not yet definitely fixed. Usu¬ 
ally the rule of primogeniture was followed, but it had not yet re¬ 
ceived universal acceptance. More often than not, actual possession 
of power counted far more than primogenitory rights. Probably in 
a struggling community like the Rathors, the growth of the State 
was helped by the acknowledgment of the successful leader as the 
lawful sovereign as well. Besides, the sardars possessed great 
powers in the State and any claimant who had the support of a 


355 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


strong group among them was almost sure to get the desired position. 
Hence the aspirants to the throne sought to enlist their support and 
in many cases, if not all, the successful canvasser was the successful 
candidate. But the most potent cause of succession troubles was 
to be found in the social custom by which every prince had a number 
of wives. The consequence was that there took place quarrels 
among the co-wives, each trying to get the throne for her son on 
the husband’s death. 

Of the seventeen sons of Jodha, the eldest, according to the 
Khyats, was Nibo who was the tikdyet or heir apparent. But Nibo 
died, leaving no issue, before his father. Unfortunately, the Khyats 
do not help us to form a clear idea about the order of Nibo’s brothers 
according to seniority. In an article discussing the situation, 
Dr. Tessitori maintains that in a Khyat, discovered in Phalodhi, it 
is mentioned that after Jodha’s death, the nobles were going to 
place the tikd on Joga but he was found demented. Thereupon they 
consecrated Satal instead who appears to have stood next by birth. 
Shortly afterwards, however, Satal died and Bika came to Jodhpur 
in the hope of securing the throne. The fact that being a stranger 
in Jodhpur for many years he came here and found a section of 
the people, including the commander of the fort of Jodhpur, ready to 
take up his cause, indicates that he stood next to Satal in seniority. 
But Bika s attempt failed and another brother, Suja, secured the 
the throne. In support of Suja’s claims the Jodhpur Khyats maintain 
that Satal had adopted Suja’s son Naro and the latter again re¬ 
nounced his rights in favour of Suja. It seems clear that from the 
point of view of heredity Suja had no claims upon the Jodhpur throne. 
But although he had no legitimate claim to the throne of Jodhpur 
by birth, it was rendered valid by election by the assembly of the 
nobles who had the power to set aside the law of primogeniture and 
legalize the succession of a younger son. 

History repeated itself when Suja died in 1515. Rathor Khyats 
maintain that Bagha, his eldest son, had predeceased him leaving 
two sons by different wives, Viramjl and Ganga. Normally the 
former should have secured the throne and on the eve of Suja’s 
death the nobles had met to put the tikd on him. But Ganga’s 
mother won them over and thus Viramjl was passed over in favour 
of Ganga. Viramjl, with the help of a section of the sardars, secured 
the district of Soj hat. 

Along with the struggles of succession and partly arising out of 
the same, attempts were constantly made by the central authority 
to maintain its control over the collateral branches of the ruling 
family. Of the offshoots of the Rathor family, the earliest and the 


356 


MARWAR 


most important was the branch at Bikaner founded by Bika, Jodha’s 
son. Naturally, we find that immediately after Jodha’s death 
Satal attempted to bring Bika under his control, but without success. 
Failing against Bikaner, circumstances helped Satal to pose as the 
overlord of another offshoot, Merta, founded by Jodha’s son, Duda. 
Merta, being threatened by the Muslim governor of Ajmere, was 
compelled to turn to Satal for help. The latter came with his army 
and inflicted a defeat on the Muslims, but he fell mortally wounded 
in the battlefield (1491). 

Suja occupied the district of Jetaran but gave it away as an 
appanage to one of his sons, while another received Phalodhi. Suja 
however failed to assert his authority over Merta and Bikaner. It 
is clear that the head of Jodhpur State was faced by difficult problems 
in its policy towards the collateral branches. The only method then 
known of holding new annexations was to leave them in the hands 
of members of the ruling family. But in nearly every case these 
tried to free themselves from their dependence upon the central 
authority, either in the same generation or in the next. 

The rise and development of the Rathor State of Marwar, as 
traced in the preceding pages, throws a flood of light on the peculiar 
characteristics of the medieval Rajput State. The Rathor kingdom 
was really a conglomeration of smaller units—each such unit being 
ruled by a chieftain or sarddr who belonged to the same clan as the 
head of the State itself. In other words, the ruling faction in the 
State belonged to only one particular clan. Not only in Marwar, 
but in the other Rajput States also the same peculiarity is noticeable. 
‘One clan one State’ may therefore be regarded as the most signi¬ 
ficant feature of the Rajput policy. 

Col. Tod found in the Rajput system an exact parallel to the 
feudalism of medieval Europe; and he has taken pains to point 
out that all the incidents that were to be found in the latter had 
also their counterparts in the former. There are certainly some 
superficial resemblances, due, no doubt, to the prevalence of similar 
conditions and problems. For example, in days of difficult commu¬ 
nication, the only practicable way of maintaining the authority of 
the State in the distant parts of the same was to vest almost 
sovereign authority in the local governors. But this did not consti¬ 
tute the essence of European feudalism. In it, the most fundamental 
idea was that the king was the sole landowner in the country, and 
the vassals could only be landholders. In medieval Rajputana, how¬ 
ever, the State belonged to the clan, the king being only the mouth¬ 
piece of the same. That this was the conception held about the 
Rajput kingship may be understood from the tribal organization of 


357 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the State as mentioned above, and the fact that whenever the king 
did anything against the interest of the State, the sardars could, 
and did, depose him, and select a person on the throne, even if he had 
no primogenitary claims in his favour. Even as late as the nine¬ 
teenth century this was the idea maintained about the position of the 
king vis-a-vis the clan. Col. Tod refers to a memorandum sent by 
the sardcirs of Marwar against their king Mansingh to the E.I.Co. 
in which occur the following words 44 :— 

“When our services are acceptable, then is he our lord; when 
not, we are again his brothers and kindred, claimants and laying 
claim to the land”. 

It is also interesting to note in this connection that in Europe 
the age of feudalism was followed by that of royal despotism which 
thrived on the theory of ‘divine right’. In Rajputana, it was not 
and could not be so. For, if the king claimed divinity, it was equally 
shared by the clansmen who and the king were sons of the same 
father. The term used in Rajputana to denote the clan including 
the king was “Bhayyad” or brotherhood. Again, since the king was 
the social head, it was not possible for others than legitimate mem¬ 
bers of the clan to be raised to the throne. In Europe, the bastard 
William, Duke of Normandy, could become the king of feudal 
England. But in Rajputana such a thing was unthinkable . 45 

At the end of our period, however, we notice a change gradually 
affecting the position of the Rajput king. From being the ‘primus 
inter pares he was slowly becoming the irresponsible head of the 
State. This was no doubt due to the influence of the Sultanate. 
For when the Sultans set up their authority over the Rajput 
States, they followed the policy of always supporting the local 
potentate; hence the power of the ruler of the Rajput State in¬ 
creased at the expense of the right of the clan. Lest one may think 
that some sort of popular government is indicated by the power of 
the clansmen over the State, it must be remembered that in every 
Rajput State the ruling clan was only a minority. The bulk of the 
people were non-Rajputs and did not belong to the ruling clan. The 
Rajput government was therefore that of a handful of people of 
one clan over many who had not the good fortune of being members 
of this privileged clan. 

The Rajput military organization also may be understood when 
the tribal foundation of the State is borne in mind. In warfare, 
the king was helped by the armies of the chieftains or sardars. But 
each chieftain was the leader of the men of his own sub-clan or sub¬ 
section of the clan. When the battle began, we find the members 
of each sub-section fighting under the banner of their own leader. 


358 


MARWAR 


The Rajputs fought on horseback. But he did not fight because 
he enjoyed any knights’ fee granted him by the sovereign of the 
State or his immediate leader, as in Europe. He fought because as 
a member of the clan he must support his clan, and it was as such 
that the State had to support him by giving him an appanage or 
otherwise. 

In military organization also a change was slowly coming over 
the Rajput idea. At the end of the period with which this chapter 
deals, we notice some attempts to introduce infantry by one or two 
prominent rulers, and thus to create an army of the ruler as opposed 
to an army of the clan. This also was no doubt due to the influence 
of the Muslim State. The effects of these attempts are however to 
be seen in the next period of the history of the Rajputs.

APPENDIX 

A note on the chronology of the period. 

The chronology of the Rajput kings in the fourteenth century, 
as followed in this chapter, differs from that of Tod and later writers 
such as Sarda and Ojha. All are agreed upon the names of the ruling 
princes and the order of their succession. The differences are about 
the dates to be assigned to the individual reigns. 

The reign-period of Hammir is given as A.D. 1301-1365. It has 
however escaped the attention of the distinguished writers that 
in A.D. 1303, when ‘Ala-ud-dm Khalji captured Chitor, Ratnasimha 
was the ruling prince. After Ratnasimha came Lakshmanasimha, 
followed by his son Ajayasimha, and, thereafter, the latter’s nephew 
Hammir. It is clear that there was an interval between A.D. 1303 
and the accession of Hammir. In this chapter A.D. 1314 (for reasons 
shown) has been accepted as the date of Hammlr’s accession. 
And, since our authorities assign to Hammir a reign of 64 years, his 
death may be placed at A.D. 1378. 

Sarda and Ojha, however, refer to an unpublished inscription 
which is said to have been inscribed in A.D. 1366 in the reign of 
Kshetrasimha, Hammir’s son. If the date is correct, Hammlr’s acces¬ 
sion could not have taken place later than A.D. 1302, provided the 
reign of 64 years assigned to Hammir be regarded as accurate. But 
we have seen that A.D. 1302 could not have been the date of 
Hammir’s accession. Hence we have either to discard the idea of a 
reign of 64 years for Hammir and accept the correctness of the 
inscription, or, admit the accuracy of a reign of 64 years and regard 
the date A.D. 1366 as inaccurate. Since, however, all authorities, 
without exception, assign to Hammir a reign of 64 years, this should 
be accepted in preference to the evidence of an inscription which 
has not been published and may not have been correctly deciphered. 
An instance of a mistake of a similar nature committed by scholars 
with regard to a contemporary inscription may be mentioned in 
this connection. Misled by Tod’s figures, Tessitori read the date in 


359 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the Kot-Solankia inscription of V. S. 1475, as V. S. 1445, and was 
long followed by later writers. ( A list of Inscriptions of Northern 
India by Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar, p. 105). 

Hammlr was succeeded by his son Kshetrasirhha to whom Tod 
assigns a reign of 8 years (A.D. 1365-1373). According to Sarda 
and Ojha, however, he ruled 18 years (A.D. 1364-1382). Kshtra- 
simha’s son and successor was Lakshasimha or Lakha who is credit¬ 
ed with a reign of 25 years by Tod (A.D. 1373-1398). Sarda asigns 
to him a reign of 15 years (A.D. 1382-1397) at p. 8, but 37 years 
(A.D. 1382-1419) at p. 22. Ojha accepts the last figure. There is 
thus much disagreement among the scholars about the dates of 
these princes which demand further examination. 

To fix the dates of these princes we may take the help of in¬ 
scriptions, where available, as well as the internal evidence of 
synchronism of these princes with others of their times for whom 
we have definite dates. 

So far as Kshetrasimha is concerned, we have only one inscrip¬ 
tion of his reign, dated A.D. 1389, mentioned by Tod (Vol. Ill, 
p. 1802). The Kumbhalgarh inscription of A.D. 1460 (verse 196 in 
the fourth slab) states that Kshetrasimha threw into prison Rana- 
malla of Ela (Idar) who had humbled the pride of Dafar Khan (Zafar 
Khan), ruler of Pattana (Anahilwad in Gujarat). According 
to the history of Gujarat, clashes between Zafar Khan and Rana- 
malla of Idar continued for nearly 3 years (A.D. 1394-1397) (Above, 
p. 155; Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. I, Pt. 2, 232-3; also Bayley 
History of Gujarat , 76 ff). The imprisonment of Ranamalla by 
Kshetrasimha apparently took place after A.D. 1397. In other words 
Kshetrasimha was alive even after A.D. 1397. Again, the same 
inscription, verse 202, also refers to Kshetrasimha’s struggle with 
Ami-Shah (Dilavar Khan Ghuri of Malwa) and says that the former 
“seized Ami-Shah just as a snake does a frog”. Firishta informs 
us that in A.D. 1405 Alp Khan, later known as Sultan Hushang 
Ghuri, poisoned his father Dilawar Khan and occupied the throne 
of Malwa. The cryptic remarks in the inscription, noted above, sug¬ 
gest that Rana Kshetrasimha had probably a share in the catastrophe 
that ended Dilavar’s life. This is to say that Kshetrasimha was alive 
in A.D. 1405, if not later. 

The dates for Kshetrasimha postulated in the chapter seem 
justified from other considerations as well. All relevant inscrip¬ 
tions devote a large space to Kshetrasimha and refer a number of 
achievements to his credit. Along with this may also be con¬ 
sidered the account given in the Rasikapriyd commentary of the 
Gitaciovinda written by Kshetrasimha’s great-grandson, Rana 
Kumbha, where Kshetrasimha is said to have died a centenarian 
(Introduction to the Rasikavriya, verse 9). All evidence thus points 
to a long and prosperous reign of Kshetrasimha. His reign mav be 
therefore said to have continued for 27 years (A.D. 1378-1405), if 
not more. 

Kshetrasimha was succeeded by his son Lakshasimha or Lakha 
of whose reign we have two inscriptions dated A.D. 1411 and A.D. 
1417 respectively. From what we know of him from Tod’s Annals 


360 


ORISSA 


of Mewtir as well as Muhanote Nensi’s Khyat, it appears that he was 
already advanced in years when he came to the throne. This isi 
quite in keeping with the fact, indicated above, that his father died 
at a very old age. Besides, both Mewar and Marwar records indi* 
cate that throughout a large part of Lakshasimha’s reign, Ranamalla, 
son of Rai Chunda of Mandor and brother of Hamsabai (whom 
Lakha married late in his life), enjoyed an important position in 
the court of Mewar, so much so that his hands could be traced in all 
notable activities of the reign. Now, according to some Marwar re¬ 
cords Ranamalla was born in A.D. 1392 (Reu —Bharat ke Pmchina 
Rajavamsa III, 140). Apparently he could not have played a signi¬ 
ficant part in his brother-in-law’s principality until he had attained 
the age of discretion. From this consideration also it appears that 
Lakha’s accession took place not very long before A.D. 1411, the 
earliest ascertained date of his reign. The death of Lakha took place 
some time between A.D. 1417, the last known date of his reign, and 
A.D. 1421, the earliest known date of his son and successor, Rana 
Mokal.

I. THE EASTERN GAnGAS 

With the death of Narasimha I in A.D. 1264, 1 the great days 
of the Gahga dynasty came to an end. Narasimha I was succeeded 
by his son Bhanudeva I, who died after an uneventful reign of 
fifteen years, leaving an infant son, Narasimha II. For the first 
twelve years of the reign of Narasimha II, the famous Vaishnava 
scholar, Narahari Tirtha, acted as the regent; he was a disciple of 
Ananda Tirtha, the founder of the Dvaita or the Madhva school of 
philosophy. After Narahari’s retirement from office, Narasimha 
took the management of the kingdom in his own hands (A.D. 1290). 
Narasimha II had a long but uneventful reign of twenty-seven years 
(A.D. 1279-1306). It was surmised by R. D. Banerji that he led a 
campaign against the Muslims of Bengal, but the view was based on 
an erroneous interpretation of one of Narasimha’s records. 2 

Narasimha II was succeeded by his son Bhanudeva II. The Puri 
Plates of Narasimha IV give him credit for a victory over a king 
named Gayasadina who has been correctly identified with the 
Tughluq Sultan, Ghiyas-ud-dln. There is, however, nothing to sup¬ 
port the contention of R. D. Banerji that “Bhanudeva II had fought 
with Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq during his campaign In Bengal”. 3 The 
reference is obviously to the invasion of Orissa by Ghiyas-ud-dm’s 
son Ulugh Khan during the reign of the former, to which reference 
has been made above. There seems to be little doubt that though 
the Muslim forces gained some successes at first, Bhanudeva II 
ultimately forced them to withdraw. In the days when one Hindu 


361 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


State after another was crashing beneath the hammering blows of 
the Muslim hosts, it was no mean achievement on the part of 
Bhanudeva II. It is significant that the Muslim historians make only 
a very brief or passing reference to this expedition. 

Bhanudeva II died in A.D. 1328. He was succeeded by his son 
Narasimha III, who had an uneventful reign of twenty-four years 
and was succeeded by his son Bhanudeva III. During his reign 
Orissa showed visible signs of decay which had probably already 
set in during the preceding reign. She now became the victim of 
a series of foreign aggressions, which brought ruin and misery 
upon her people. Shortly after the accession of Bhanudeva III 
Sultan Shams-ud-din Ilyas Shah of Bengal raided Orissa and carried 
away a rich booty including forty-four elephants. 4 Next, the 
country was invaded by Firuz Tughluq. The flight of king Bhanu¬ 
deva III, the occupation of his capital city by the Sultan, the massacre 
of the people, and the desecration of the famous temple of Jagan- 
natha at Puri, to which detailed reference has been made above, 5 
must have shattered the power and prestige of the royal family. 

But Orissa suffered no less from the aggressions of her Hindu 

neighbours, 6 particularly the Reddis of Kondavidu. 7 Their small 

but rich kingdom, situated in the fertile deltas of the Krishna and 

the Godavari, became at this period the buffer between Vijaya- 

nagara, Orissa and the BahmanI kingdoms as well as their coveted 

prize. War between the Reddis and Orissa seems to have started 

during the reign of Bhanudeva III, when the Reddi king Anapota 

(A.D. 1355-1364), after the conquest of the Krishna-Godavarl 

deltas, seems to have led an expedition against Orissa. Anavema, 

the successor of Anapota, added the territory up to Simhachalam 

in the Vizagapatam district, which thereafter became the boundary 

between Orissa and Kondavidu and the bone of contention between 

• • • 

the two kingdoms. 

Bhanudeva III was succeeded by his son Narasimha IV, some 
time about A.D. 1378. It was during his reign that Khvaja Jahan 
founded the independent principality of Jaunpur, as mentioned 
above. He tried to restore the lost authority of the Delhi Sultanate 
over the eastern regions. It is remarked by Nizam-ud-dln in this 
connection, that the “Ray of Jajnagar and the badshah of 
Lakhnaouti sent to him the presents and the tribute which they 
had every year sent to Sultan Firoz Shah”. 8 No previous historian 
has referred to any regular tribute sent by the king of Orissa, and 
possibly it refers to the annual present of elephants which were 
promised by Bhanudeva III when he submitted to Firuz, as men¬ 
tioned above. There is nothing to show that this promise was regu- 


362 


ORISSA 


larly kept, and in any case it means nothing more than a formal 
but meaningless recognition of the authority of the Sultanate. This 
is fully proved, if proof were necessary, by the fact that, in the 
chapter dealing specifically with the Sharqis and describing the 
territories over which Khvaja Jahan established his authority, 
Nizam-ud-din does not refer to Jajnagar or Orissa. 9 BadaunI says 
that Khvaja Jahan proceeded as far as Jajnagar and took posses- 
sion of it, but, as pointed out by Ranking, who edited and translated 
the text, it was probably a mistake for Jaunpur. 10 Firishta, like 
Nizam-ud-din, says that the ruler of Bengal was forced to pay 
tribute 11 but, unlike him, makes no reference to the payment of 
tribute by Orissa. We may therefore dismiss the idea that Jaunpur 
exercised any authority over Orissa. 

Major Raverty, in course of his discussion on the identity of 
Jajnagar, stated that “Sultan Firuz, BahmanI, entered it in 815 H., 
and carried off a number of elephants”. 12 He does not cite his 
authority, but probably relied on a passage of Firishta which has 
been translated by Briggs as follows: “In the year 815, the King 
went, on pretence of hunting, into the country of Gondwara, which 
he laid waste, and brought away near (sic) three hundred ele¬ 
phants” 13 . It is difficult therefore to accept the view of Raverty, 
and of others who have relied on him, that the BahmanI Sultan 
invaded Orissa and carried off a number of elephants. 14 

But whatever we might think of these raids, the growing power 
of the Reddis was a real menace to the safety and security of Orissa. 
For a time this danger seemed to be removed, for the Reddi king¬ 
dom was convulsed, first by a disputed succession, and next by 
Vijayanagara invasion. Taking advantage of this situation Nara- 
simha IV recovered some of his lost territories in central and south 
Kalinga. His success was, however, shortlived, for the Reddis soon 
became very powerful under their famous king Kumaragiri, who, 
in A.D. 1390, invaded Orissa and reached the shores of the Chilka 
lake. This must have dealt another severe blow to the power and 
prestige of the Ganga kings, though Kumaragiri’s raid did not pro¬ 
duce any permanent result of importance. 

Narasimha IV was succeeded by his son Bhanudeva IV in or 
some time before A.D. 1414. 15 In the meantime a serious civil war 
had broken out amongst the Reddis after the death of Kumaragiri 
in A.D. 1402. 16 He had placed the province of Rajahmundry under 
his brother-in-law Kataya Verna, and was succeeded at Kondavldu, 
the Reddi capital, by Peda Komati Verna. The two principalities 
of Kondavldu and Rajahmundry came into conflict after the death 
of Kumaragiri. Kataya Verna died in a battle, and taking advantage 


363 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


of the situation Bhanudeva attacked the kingdom of Rajah- 
mundry which was at that time administered by Allada, the 
general of Kataya Verna. Bhanudeva’s invasion seems to have in¬ 
duced Vijayanagara to send an army to help Allada. However, 
Allada soon managed to end hostilities with Orissa and thereafter 
skilfully maintained friendly relations with both Orissa and Vijaya¬ 
nagara, as recorded in an inscription of his son which claims that 
Allada had made friends with both Gajapati (Bhanudeva IV) and 
Karnata. (Vijayanagara). 17 

This alliance with the Reddi chief seems to have stood Bhanu¬ 
deva in good stead when, some time later, in A.D. 1422, he was 
treacherously captured by Sultan Hushang of Malwa, as mentioned 
above. According to Muslim historians, Hushang, being in urgent 
need of elephants, proceeded to Orissa in the guise of a trader 
in horses and other goods. When Bhanudeva, accompanied by a 
small retinue, came to visit the caravan, he was seized by Hushang 
and carried away, and was not released till after a number of valu¬ 
able elephants were presented to the treacherous Sultan. There are, 
however, good grounds to believe that the Muslim account does not 
contain the whole truth. Epigraphic as well as literary evidences 
seem to leave no doubt that Hushang was defeated by the Reddi 
chief, Allada, and according to one source, the latter caused the 
horses of the former to be plundered. Now, according to Muslim 
historians, Hushang took with him horses of different colours which 
the king of Orissa prized most; and Hushang is not known to have 
carried any other expedition in this region. It may be therefore 
surmised that the battle between Hushang and the Reddi chief 
Allada was connected with the treacherous attempt of the former 
to abduct Bhanudeva. It is not unlikely that Allada, as soon as he 
heard the news of Hushang’s treacherous conduct, hastened to the 
aid of Bhanudeva, and the defeat he inflicted upon Hushang had 
something to do with the release of Bhanudeva IV. In any case, 
Hushang’s raid had no effect on the power of Orissa, and Hushang 
was severely molested by Allada Reddi during his return journey 
to Malwa. 17a 

Allada died about A.D. 1423, and soon after his death Bhanu¬ 
deva invaded the Reddi kingdom. He seems to have been helped 
by the Velama chiefs of Telingana and conquered the whole of the 
coastal Telugu country. No records of the Reddis of Kondavldu for 
the period between A.D. 1425 and 1432, and the Reddis of Rajah- 
mundry between A.D. 1423 and 1428 have yet come to light, though 
before and after these dates their records are available in series. It 
has therefore been assumed, that during this interval the Reddi 


364 


ORISSA 


kingdom passed into the hands of Bhanudeva, and this is corrobo¬ 
rated by several kaifiyats of the villages in the coastal districts of 
the Telugu country. 18 

Bhanudeva, however, had soon to face the might of the Vijaya- 
nagara empire. He could no longer count on the support of his 
Velama allies as they had been crushed in the meantime by the 
Bahmani king. Bhanudeva at first fared very badly in his fight with 
Vijayanagara. A Vijayanagara inscription of A.D. 1429 states that 
Devaraya defeated the Gajapati, and another inscription at Simha- 
chalam shows, that by A.D. 1428 the Vijayanagara army had reached 
that place. Bhanudeva, however, probably recaptured the place, 
for one of his records found at Simhachalam is dated Saka 1352 
(A.D. 1430). 19 But some time before A.D. 1434 he was finally dis¬ 
lodged from this region by the Reddis. 20 While Bhanudeva was 
thus engaged in the south, a palace revolution had taken place 
against him. Taking advantage of his long absence from the capital 
and his reverses in the field, his ministers raised one Kapilendra to 
the throne (c. A.D. 1434-5). Bhanudeva must have felt unable to 
face this new calamity. According to the Gangavamsdnucharitara, 
the only available evidence, on hearing the news of the revolution, 
he expelled the chief of Gudari-Kataka and settled there. His last 
days were passed in this place, but nothing more is known of this 
unfortunate ex-ruler of Orissa. 21 

II. THE GAJAPATI KINGS OF ORISSA 

1. Kapilendra 

The dynasty established by Kapilendra is known as the Surya- 
vamsa, because the kings of the family claimed descent from the sun. 
They are also known as the Gajapati kings of Orissa, because all of 
them adopted that biruda (epithet). 

No reliable information is available about the ancestors or the 
early life of Kapilendra, and the circumstances which led to his 
accession are also far from clear. It seems that after his accession 
(c. A.D. 1434-35), Kapilendra had to overcome some opposition and 
adopted the popular measure of remitting taxes on salt and cowries. 
Soon after, he started a career of conquest which has made his name 
famous in the annals of Orissa. 

Kapilendra seems to have gradually extended his sway over the 
south, and conquered the Vishakhiapatam (Vizagapatam) district by 
A.D. 1443. Though his further attack upon Rajahmundry ended 
in failure during the reign of Devaraya II (1422-46), he succeeded in 
seizing the Godavari delta after his death. Between 1450-54 the 


365 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Orissan army reduced Rajahmundry, crossed the Krishna and cap¬ 
tured Kondavldu, as has already been mentioned above in Chapter 
XII. 

On the basis of a statement in the Gahgadasa-prabdpa-vildsarn, 
it is generally held that Kapilendra, allied with the BahmanI Sultan, 
attacked Vijayanagara, but was defeated by the young king Malli- 
karjuna. This statement is not supported by any contemporary 
evidence, and it is difficult to believe that Kapilendra allied himself 
with the Bahmanis, with whom his relation was far from cordial. 21a 

Kapilendra was also successful in his campaign against Bengal. 
It appears that he captured some territories in West Bengal to the 
west of the Ganga, including the fort of Mandaran (Hooghly district), 
though it seems to have been lost later. According to Nizam-ud- 
dln and Firishta, Jajnagar, that is Orissa, was twice invaded during 
this period by the rulers of Jaunpur. In A. D. 1444-45, Mahmud 
Shah is said to have reduced the province of Orissa and destroyed 
the temples and plundered its wealth. Husain Shah sent a large 
army against Orissa shortly after his accession. The king of Orissa, 
unable to resist, conciliated the invader with presents. 2113 It is also 
known that during the reign of Sultan ‘Ala-ud-dln Ahmad II (A.D. 
1436-1458) border skirmishes took place at Telingana between the 
forces of Orissa and the BahmanI empire. Though Tabataba main¬ 
tains that Sanjar Khan, the BahmanI general, “used constantly to 
take as prisoners the cursed people of the districts”, it appears that 
the BahmanI forces really gained very little success, for he states: 
“The Sultan (Ala-ud-dln Ahmad) himself used often to say: ‘Why 
does Sanjar Khan match himself in battle against the possessors of 
elephants?’ For at that time in the government of BahmanI Sultans 
there were not more than about one hundred and fifty elephants 
whilst those infidels had nearly two hundred thousand.” 22 

But a more serious clash between Orissa and the BahmanI 
empire came about 1458 when two BahmanI nobles rebelled against 
their Sultan, Humayun II, and received help from the Velama chief 
of Telingana, whereupon the BahmanI forces besieged Devarakonda 
(Nalgonda district), the stronghold of the Yelamas. The Velamas, 
reduced to extremities, appealed for help to Kapilendra, who sent 
his eldest son Hamvlra with a large army. Tabataba writes that the 
king of Orissa, “from greed of gain and for the defence of paganism, 
thought himself bound to assist the infidels of that fortress; so he 
sent a countless force with a hundred elephants to the assistance of 
the defenders of the fortress” (of Devarakonda). The BahmanI com¬ 
mander learnt in time of the advance of the Orissan army, but before 
he could extricate his troops from their unfavourable position, the 

366 


ORISSA 


Orissan army came upon them and the Velamas also sallied out 
Irom the fort. Caught between the two forces, the BahmanI army 
was routed, and the whole of their baggage, elephants and horses 
looted. The Musulmans were pursued to a distance of 3 jarsakhs; 
nearly six or seven thousand of their cavalry were killed, 
and a great number, besides, died of thirst in the deserts.” 23 Shortly 
afterwards, Hamvira conquered Warangal. 

Humayun Shah died in 1461 and was succeeded by his son 
Nizam Shah, a boy of eight. Taking advantage of the situation 
Kapilendra advanced into the interior of the Bahmani empire, 
plundering the country within a distance of ten miles from the capi¬ 
tal. Then his advance was checked by the Bahmani army and 
evidently Kapilendra was defeated; but the statement of Muslim 
historians that an advance guard of 160 horsemen routed the invad¬ 
ing Orissa army, flushed with victory, is hardly credible. 

Kapilendra next sent an army under Hamvira to conquer the 
Tamil coastal districts. Hamvira first captured Udayagiri, some 
time after A.D. 1463, and later, Chandragiri also fell into his hands. 
The Orissan army next took Kanchl by force, and in A.D. 1464 
reached the Kaverl. Kapilendra seems to have attempted the per¬ 
manent annexation of the newly conquered territories, but soon had 
to give up most of it, as has been stated above. 23a In A.D. 1464, 
Kapilendra advanced as far as Vijayawada (Bezwada), but returned 
from that place. Again in A.D. 1467 he reached the river Krishna, 
apparently in an attempt to reconquer the Tamil districts, but he 
died there, probably in February, 1467, though some place this 
event in A.D. 1470. 23b 

Kapilendra was the most powerful Hindu king of his time, and 
under him Orissa became an empire stretching from the lower 
Ganga in the north to the Kaverl in the south. But great as his 
military genius undoubtedly was, it was not matched by his states¬ 
manship. He failed to recognize the need and importance of an 
alliance with the Hindu ruler of Vijayanagara against the Muslim 
rulers of Bengal and the Deccan, and instead of measuring arms 
with them, he exhausted his resources in trying to conquer the out¬ 
lying provinces of Vijayanagara. He thereby left a legacy of 
hostility with Vijayanagara and two formidable Muslim enemies on 
his two other frontiers, which ultimately led to the downfall of his 
dynasty. 

2. Purushottama 

Before his death, Kapilendra had nominated his younger son, 
Purushottama, to succeed him. This enraged the valiant Hamvira, 


367 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


who was probably the eldest son of Kapilendra. Soon after his 
accession, Purushottama set out to recover the Tamil districts which 
were lost during the last years of his father’s reign. Purushottama 
advanced up to Kahchl, but returned without gaining any success. 
It was a dismal failure, but worse things were yet to come. 

In A.D. 1471, the discontented Hamvlra joined the BahmanI 
Sultan, and being assured of help to regain his throne, conquered 
for him the provinces of Rajahmundry and Kondavidu. But as soon 
as the conquests were over, the Bahmanls lost all interest in Hamvira, 
and he was only granted an asylum at Kondavidu. Some time later, 
the garrison at Kondavidu murdered their commander and delivered 
the fort to Hamvlra. According to Firishta, Hamvira then sent a mes¬ 
sage to Purushottama promising to surrender the fort of Kondavidu 
and its dependencies to him in exchange for Telingana. Thus 
assured, Purushottama advanced and captured Rajahmundry, but 
soon after gave it up in the face of a strong BahmanI attack which 
threatened to cut off his lines of communications with his capital. 
According to Firishta, the BahmanI Sultan, Muhammad III, then 
pursued the Orissan army and invaded Orissa, forcing Purushottama 
to purchase peace by surrendering twenty-five of his best elephants. 

Muhammad III next advanced against Hamvlra who, from the 
Kondavidu fort, had carried out depredations into the BahmanI terri¬ 
tory. Hamvlra surrendered the fort after a siege of five months. 
What happened to him after this incident is not known. Taking 
advantage of this situation Saluva Narasirhha recovered Udayagiri. 

Purushottama, however, took advantage of the rapid decline that 
set in in the BahmanI kingdom after the death of Mahmud Gavan 
in 1481, and of Muhammad III in the following year. He reconquered 
Udayagiri, and thereafter seems to have enjoyed peace till his death 
between April and September, 1497. 

3. Prataparudra and his successors 

Purushottama was succeeded by his son Prataparudra, the last 
great king of the dynasty. Shortly after his accession Prataparudra 
advanced with an army to conquer the south, but, after reaching the 
Pennar, abandoned the project for some unknown reason. However, 
after the accession of Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara (A.D. 1509), 
Prataparudra again proceeded to the south, presumably to adopt 
defensive measures, and stayed there at least up to October, 1510. 
Taking advantage of his absence, Sultan Husain Shah of Bengal in¬ 
vaded Orissa, captured Puri, and destroyed the idols in the Jagan- 
natha temple. 24 On receipt of the news, Prataparudra hurried 


368 


ORISSA 


north and Husain Shah retreated to Bengal where he took shelter in 
the fort of Mandaran (Hooghly district). Prataparudra besieged the 
fort but, due to the treachery of one of his generals, Govinda Vidya- 
dhara, was compelled to come to terms with Husain Shah. 

In A.D. 1513, Krishnadevaraya declared war upon the Gajapati. 
It was a protracted war lasting over five years of which a detailed 
account has been given above in Chapter XII. Krishnadeva invaded 
the southern part of Prataparudra’s empire and, after a siege of 
eighteen months, captured the fort of Udayagiri on June 9, 1514. 25 
Next year Krishnadeva again led a campaign against Prataparudra, 
which began with the capitulation of a number of fortified places 
in the Guntur District, and ended with the fall of Kondavldu. The 
fort of Kondavldu was captured by a vigorous assault on June 23, 
1515, and several princes of Orissa, together with a son and a queen 
of Prataparudra, were taken prisoners. By the end of the year 
Krishnadeva opened his third campaign against Orissa, captured 
Bezwada, and besieged the fort of Kondapalli which surrendered 
after a brief resistance. Prataparudra, according to Nuniz, advanc¬ 
ed against his enemy with a large force, but was defeated and put to 
flight. Krishnadeva completed this campaign by capturing Rajah- 
mundry. He advanced as far as Simhachalam and then returned to 
his capital; but his army advanced as far as Srlkurmam, where a 
pillar of victory was erected. 26 

Hostilities were brought to an end by a treaty concluded some 
time before August 8, 1519. 26a According to Nuniz, a contemporary 
writer, when the Orissan Prince, Vlrabhadra, who was taken pri¬ 
soner after the fall of Kondavldu, had committed suicide as he felt 
insulted at the court of Vijayanagara, Prataparudra became afraid 
for the safety of his wife, who was also a prisoner at Vijayanagara, 
and concluded peace with Krishnaraya. This account has been 
doubted by some, though on very insufficient grounds. 27 But it is 
quite likely that apart from sentimental grounds caused by repeated 
defeats, the precarious military position of Prataparudra was a great 
incentive to peace-efforts on his part. By this treaty he had to cede 
all the territories to the south of the Krishna. According to Nuniz, 
he had also to give his daughter in marriage to Krishnadeva. This 
marriage proved unhappy and the queen was neglected by her hus¬ 
band, 28 adding one more to the list of grievances of Prataparudra 
against the king of Vijayanagara. It is no wonder, therefore, that 
he should have made one more effort to settle accounts with that 
kingdom after the death of Krishnadeva, who had proved more than 
a match for him. There are some grounds to believe that imme¬ 
diately after the death of Krishnadeva he invaded the kingdom of 

369 

D.S.—24 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Vijayanagara, but was defeated and driven away, 29 although the 
evidence in support of it cannot be regarded as conclusive. 30 

Not long after Prataparudra had concluded the treaty with 
Krishnadeva, and probably before the death of the latter, he suffered 
the loss of Telingana which was conquered by Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk, 
the governor of Bahmani king, and, later, the founder of the indepen¬ 
dent Sultanate of Golconda. Qutb-ul-Mulk ultimately conquered 
the whole of the Krishna-Godavarl dodb, and as he died in A.D. 1543, 
probably the conquest took place during the lifetime of Pratapa¬ 
rudra, whose death took place about A.D. 1540. 31 

Thus from a purely military and political point of view the 
reign of Prataparudra was an inglorious one, and though the king¬ 
dom he left to his successor after his death was fairly big—almost as 
large as that of the Gangas at the height of their power—the sun of 
glory of the Gajapatis suffered an eclipse during his reign and may 
be said to have set at his death. He was succeeded by his son 
Kaluadeva who was murdered after a reign of about a year and a 
half, by Govinda Vidyadhara, whose treachery has been mentioned 
above. Kaluadeva’s brother Kakharuadeva, then ascended the 
throne, but was murdered by the same Vidyadhara after about three 
months. With Kakharuadeva the Suryavamsi dynasty came to an 
end, and the traitor Govinda Vidyadhara seized the kingdom. 

Whatever we might think of the political career of Prataparu¬ 
dra, he occupies a prominent place in the religious history of India 
on account of his close intimacy with Sri Chaitanya, the great 
Vaishnava saint of Bengal, who spent the last seventeen years of his 
life at Puri. There is no doubt that Prataparudra was greatly in¬ 
fluenced by the teaching of Chaitanya, but it is a moot point to 
decide whether, and if so how far, his political discomfiture may be 
attributed to this fact. R. D. Banerji has taken an extreme view in 
this matter, and even goes so far as to say that “Chaitanya was one 
of the principal causes of the political decline of the empire and the 
people of Orissa”. 32 As a concrete evidence in support of his view 
he has partially quoted a passage from the Chaitanya-mangala, a 
Bengali Vaishnava work, which possesses great interest for more 
reasons than one. Chaitanya visited Puri when Sultan Husain Shah 
of Bengal had already commenced his hostile activities against 
Orissa. Although this Sultan has been highly eulogized by several 
Bengali poets as an ideal king—one writer goes even so far as to say 
that he was the incarnation of Krishna—he possessed the bigotry 
and iconoclastic zeal which characterized the Muslim rulers in India. 
Chaitanya was fully aware of the oppressions committed upon the 
Hindus in Bengal during his reign and the destruction of images and 


370 



ORISSA 


temples by him in Orissa. According to the Vaishnava work refer¬ 
red to above, Prataparudra desired to chastise Husain Shah, and 
asked for the advice of Chaitanya. The latter dissuaded him on the 
ground that the Yavana invasion would ruin Orissa and the God 
Jagannatha would leave Puri (meaning that his temple and image 
would be destroyed). So Chaitanya advised Prataparudra to con¬ 
quer, not Bengal, but Kanchl. It is difficult to say how far this 
statement is true, and whether, as R. D. Banerji holds, “the advice 
of Chaitanya was sufficient to cause this cowardly and religiously- 
minded king to desist from a proper defence of his own territories.” 33 
It is to be remembered that Chaitanya asked Prataparudra not to 
invade Bengal, but never suggest that he should neglect the defen¬ 
sive measures against the invasion of Husain Shah. Nor is there any 
reason to suppose that Prataparudra did so. Today a Hindu might 
justly deplore the fact that the two great Hindu kingdoms of the 
first half of the sixteenth century should fight with each other in¬ 
stead of combining against their common foe, the Muslim rulers in 
their neighbourhood. But such attitude was not confined to reli¬ 
gious men, nor is it due to Vaishnava religion. For instance, when 
Krishnadeva expressed a desire to fight with the Muslim rulers, his 
ministers advised him to begin by destroying the power of the Gaja- 
pati king of Orissa. 34 The Vaishnava work, referred to above, winds 
up the account by saying that Prataparudra accepted the advice of 
Chaitanya, and, therefore, instead of Gauda, he invaded Vijaya- 
nagara. It may be reasonably doubted whether a Gajapati king of 
Orissa would at all require any such advice to urge him to the 
invasion of Vijayanagara, with which there was a hereditary and 
perpetual enmity. 

So far as evidence goes, Prataparudra ably carried on his ad¬ 
ministration and even continued his military activities for many 
years after he had met Chaitanya and come under his influence. It 
is, therefore, difficult to substantiate the charge that the influence 
of Vaishnavism was at the root of his military failure and the 
political decline of Orissa. Surrounded by powerful enemies on all 
sides, having to fight simultaneously on two distant fronts against 
the powerful rulers of Bengal and Vijayanagara, and menaced by the 
Bahmanls on the third, Prataparudra’s discomfiture admits of a natu¬ 
ral explanation, and we need not drag in Saint Chaitanya to cover 
his fault, if any. Of course, it must be admitted that he did not 
belong to the type of his two illustrious predecessors, so far as per¬ 
sonal ability and military skill were concerned, but that has been 
the case with most royal families, and the decline and fall of the 
Gajapati empire does not exhibit such unusual features as to call for 
any special explanation.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


In conclusion, reference must be made to another unjustified 
charge against Prataparudra made by several eminent Indian histo¬ 
rians, namely that he made a common cause with the Muslim rulers 
of Bijapur against the Hindu king of Vijayanagara. In this matter, 
again, R. D. Banerji takes an extreme view. “The acquisition of 
help” says he, “from a Musalman neighbour to fight with a Hindu 
adversary involved a moral and political degradation.” 35 The denun¬ 
ciation was based solely upon the names of two prisoners captured 
by the Vijayanagara army after the fall of Kondavldu, namely 

Rachuri Mallu Khan and Uddanda Khan. These were taken to be 

• • 

Muslim names, and the presence of two Muslim officers at Kondavldu 
was looked upon by both Krishna Sastri and S.K. Aiyangar as an 
indication of Gajapati’s alliance with the Muslim rulers of the 
Deccan. But, as Venkataramanayya has justly pointed out, “the 
name Mallu, though occasionally borne by the Mussalmans, is a 
common personal name among the Hindus of South India at that 
time; and Uddanda is a purely Hindu name and is never met with 
among the Muhammadans. Then about the appellation, Khan, there 
is definite evidence to show that some Hindu chiefs of this age 
styled themselves Khan”. 36 These facts are decisive in the matter: 
but even assuming that the two officers were Muslims, they hardty 
sustain the charge, for in that age the Hindu kings employed Muslim 
officers, and a large number of Muslim mercenaries were in the ser¬ 
vice of Vijayanagara. Even Furushottama Gajapati had some Muslim 
officers. 37 In view of all these considerations the unlucky king 
Prataparudra must be exonerated from the charge that some notable 
Indian historians have brought against him on rather flimsy grounds. 

C. KASHMIR 

I. END OF HINDU RULE IN KASHMIR 

The accession of Suhadeva seemed to augur well for the king¬ 
dom of Kashmir. After a period of anarchy and confusion, he united 
the whole kingdom under his authority and set up a stable govern¬ 
ment (A.D. 1301 )d Unfortunately a great calamity befell his king¬ 
dom. Kashmir was invaded by Dulucha, said to be the general of 
king Karmasena, 2 with 60,000 horsemen. Stiha tried to induce him 
to retreat by paying a large amount of money, and for this purpose 
imposed heavy taxes upon all classes of people, including the Brah- 
manas. But though this made him highly unpopular, his object 
was not served. Dulucha ravaged the country by fire and sword 
and inflicted indescribable miseries upon the people. Ultimately he 


KASHMIR 


was forced to quit the country on account of excessive cold, but took 
with him a large number of Kashmirians as slaves (vv. 152 ff.). 

While Dulucha was harrying Kashmir from the east, another 
enemy invaded it from the north. This was Rihchana, 3 the son of 
a Western Tibetan chief, who occupied a part of Kashmir and ob¬ 
tained enormous wealth by selling the people of Kashmir to the 
Tibetans. After the departure of Dulucha he tried to establish his 
authority over the whole kingdom, but was opposed by one Rama- 
chandra. Rihchana, however, killed Ramachandra by treacherous 
means and married his daughter Kotadevl. King Suhadeva steal¬ 
thily left the city, 4 and Rihchana made himself the undisputed 
master of the whole kingdom of Kashmir. This took place about 
A.D. 1320. 5 

Rihchana was an able ruler and soon restored peace and happi¬ 
ness in the hapless country. Jonaraja gives a detailed account of 
his wise administration and sense of justice, which made the people 
of Kashmir feel that the golden age had returned. Some of the old 
companions of the king, who had accompanied him from Tibet to 
Kashmir, hatched a conspiracy against him, and severely wounded 
him by a treacherous attack. The king, however, survived what 
appeared to the conspirators to be a mortal blow, and took terrible 
vengeance on the traitors. They were impaled “and the angry king 
ripped open by the sword the wombs of his enemies’ wives who were 
with child” (v. 244). But the wound inflicted on the head of the king 
w,as not completely healed, and he died, probably of its effect, after 
a rule of a little over three years. 5a 

It is generally assumed by the historians that Rihchana had 
embraced the Muslim faith and assumed the name of Sadr-ud-din. 
Jonaraja, however, does not refer to it. Some support to the tra¬ 
dition may be found in his statement that “the king asked Sri Deva- 
svami to initiate him in the mantras of Siva, but as he was a Bhotta, 
Devasvaml feared that the king was unworthy of such initiation, and 
did not favour him”. 6 But as this is not followed by any reference 
to the adoption of Islam by the king, it constitutes a very strong 
negative evidence against the popular tradition. This is further 
strengthened by the comment of Jonaraja, with reference to a later 
event in which Sahamera, a Muslim, played a prominent part, 
namely: “Strange that this believer in Alla became the saviour of 
the people”. 7 It is also to be noted that both Nizam-ud-dln and 
Firishta describe Rihchana as an infidel and expressly state that his 
queen Kotadevl embraced Islam after she had married Shah Mir 
after the death of Rihchana. Both these authorities look upon 
Shah Mir as the first Muslim Sultan of Kashmir. There is thus no 

373 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


valid reason to assume that Rinchana adopted Islam, in spite of 
popular traditions to the contrary. 8 

Sahamera, just mentioned above, was a foreign Muslim adven¬ 
turer who came to Kashmir, according to Jonaraja, in Saka 1235 
(A.D. 1313) and was greatly favoured by the king (vv. 150-51). 
Rihchana was highly pleased with him, particularly because he did 
not join in the conspiracy against him mentioned above. “He placed 
in his hands his son Haidar together with the child’s mother Kota 
for the purpose of bringing up the prince”. 9 According to Jonaraja, 
Haidar being very young, Sahamera, who did not feel strong enough 
to usurp the throne, bestowed it, along with queen Kota, upon 
Udayanadeva. 10 The new king was a pious orthodox Hindu who 
spent his time in bathing, penance and prayer, and gave all the 
golden ornaments in his treasury to God Vishnu. The king’s ad¬ 
ministrative ability was not, however, equal to his piety, and the 
queen seems to have exercised the real power and authority. When 
the kingdom was invaded by Achala, the king fled to Tibet, but the 
queen, by a foul stratagem, procured the death of the invader and 
saved the kingdom. Sahamera also played a conspicuous part in 
protecting the people during the troubles caused by Achala’s in¬ 
vasion, and thereby increased his influence so much that he showed 
but scant respect to king Udayana, who had returned after the death 
of Achala. Sahamera further strengthened his position by matri¬ 
monial relations with powerful chiefs in Kashmir, his military 
abilities, and his possession of extensive territories including some 
strong forts. 

In A.D. 1338, king Udayana died, and the queen Kota was 
placed in a great dilemma. Her elder son by Rinchana was under 
the influence of Sahamera, and the queen rightly feared that if he 
became king, Sahamera would rule the kingdom through him. Her 
younger son by Udayana was a mere boy. She kept the death of 
the king a secret for four days and then assumed the sovereign 
authority (vv. 299-302). Sahamera and other ministers obeyed her, 
but the queen was afraid of this Muslim upstart and placed her chief 
confidence on Bhatta Bhikshana (vv. 304-6). This enraged Saha¬ 
mera and he treacherously murdered Bhikshana. Although Kota 
displayed great ability in administering the affairs of the kingdom, 
she was no match for the wily Muslim. As Jonaraja says, she “was 
neither favourable to, nor angry with the powerful Sahamera”. 11 
In other words, she estranged Sahamera but did not take adequate 
precaution against him. The inevitable result followed. Taking 
advantage of the absence of the queen, Sahamera seized the capital 
and besieged the fort of Kotta where the queen had taken shelter. 


374 


KASHMIR 


He offered the queen to share the throne with him by becoming his 
wife, and she foolishly agreed (vv. 345-6). After spending one 
night with Kota, Sahamera imprisoned her in the morning and then 
imprisoned her two children also (vv. 347-9). Sahamera thus be¬ 
came the undisputed master of Kashmir and founded a Muslim 
dynasty of rulers about A.D. 1339. 12 The Muslim historians 13 call 
him Shah Mir, which was probably his real name, as Sahamera of 
Jonaraja is a normal transcription of Shah Mir. But some authorities 
call him Shah Mirza. 14 He assumed the title of Shams-ud-din Shah 
on ascending the throne. 


II. THE SHAH MIR! DYNASTY 
1. Shams-ud-din to ‘All Shah 

The accession of Shah Mir or Shams-ud-din marks the begin¬ 
ning not only of a new dynasty but also of the Muslim rule in 
Kashmir. For, whatever we might think of Rinchana’s conversion 
to Islam, his immediate successors were Hindus, and even his own 
queen does not seem to have abjured her old Hindu faith. 15 

Not much is known of Shams-ud-din’s career as a king. He 
seems to have been a strong and able ruler and succeeded in restoring 
order and reviving the prosperity of the kingdom after recent 
troubles. According to Jonaraja, he “assuaged the troubles of 
Kashmir and changed its condition (v. 352). 16 According to Firishta, 
“he took off the heavy imposts under which the people laboured, 
protected them from the annual exactions of Dlijoo, chief of Kash- 
ghar, and fixed the assessment of land at seventeen per cent on the 
gross produce.” 17 A luni-solar era, even now current in Kashmir, 
is believed by some to have been introduced by Shams-ud-din to 
commemorate the conversion of Rihchana to Islam in A.D. 1320. 18 
But, as noted above, there is a great deal of doubt about the conver¬ 
sion, and the association of either Rihchana or Shams-ud-din with 
the era is extremely doubtful, and certainly rests upon no reliable 
evidence. 

Shams-ud-din died after a short reign of three years, in A.D. 
1342, and was succeeded by his eldest son Jamshid. The new king 
was deposed by his brother ‘Ali Sher, probably within a few months 
of his accession. He, however, maintained a precarious existence 
somewhere in Kashmir, for nearly two years. 19 ‘Ali Sher ascended 
the throne under the name of ‘Ala-ud-din and reigned for more than 
twelve years. He transferred the capital to Jayapidapura, and his 
reign was on the whole peaceful, though a terrible famine inflicted 


875 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


great miseries upon the people. He passed an important social legi¬ 
slation abolishing the evil custom under which a childless widow, 
though unchaste, obtained a share of her husband’s property from 
her father-in-law. 20 

‘Ala-ud-dln was succeeded by Shihab-ud-din who was most 
probably his brother. 21 His long reign of nineteen years is a memo¬ 
rable period in the history of Kashmir. He had an insatiable 
thirst for military campaigns, and cared for neither wine nor women. 
He carried his victorious arms in all directions. He first went to 
the north which had never been conquered by previous kings and 
which was peopled by the Parasikas. He then defeated Govind 
Khan and conquered Udabhandapura (Ohind). The king of Sindhu 
was forced to come to terms with him by offering his daughter in 
marriage. He also defeated the Gandharas and the Srihgas and 
seized the town of Ashtanagara (eight cities situated close together 
on the eastern bank of the lower Swat river), 22 inhabited by the 
srotriya Brahmanas and Kshatriyas. Proceeding further, he seized 
Peshawar and, according to Firishta, advanced as far as the Hindu- 
kush mountains. These victories are said to have spread conster¬ 
nation as far as Ghazni and Kandahar. 

Shihab-ud-din then proceeded towards the south and reached 
the banks of the Sutlej. There he met Udakapati, ruler of Nagarkot, 
who had ravaged some of the estates appertaining to Delhi and was 
returning home. According to Nizam-ud-dm, Udakapati rendered 
homage to the Kashmir Sultan and surrendered to him the vast 
quantity of the booty which he was carrying with him. According 
to the same authority the ruler of Tibet also waited upon the Sultan. 
Jonaraja, however, simply says that Shihab-ud-din harassed Udaka¬ 
pati and it was the Sultan’s humility, not the prowess of Tibet, that 
saved that region from his attack. Later writers obviously exag¬ 
gerated his achievements; 23 but Shihab-ud-dln’s conquests do not 
seem to have permanently extended the boundaries of Kashmir and 
were probably more of the nature of military raids. Neverthe¬ 
less Shihab-ud-din’s reign represents, from the political and military 
point of view, the most glorious epoch in the history of the Muslim 
Sultanate of Kashmir. After a long interval Kashmir emerged as 
a great power and established her reputation as such outside her 
boundaries. One episode related by Jonaraja, if true, marks out 
Shihab-ud-din as possessed of a spirit of religious toleration which 
was seldom displayed by any Muslim ruler in India. Once when 
the treasury was empty, his minister suggested the easy expedient 
of melting the metal images of gods and converting them into coins. 
Thereupon the king admonished him in the following words: “Some 


376 


KASHMIR 


have obtained renown by setting up images of gods, others, by 
worshipping them, some by duly maintaining them; and I shall 
be eternally disgraced by demolishing them. King Shihab-ud-dln, it 
will be said, plundered the image of a god; and this bad renown will 
torment men in future.” 24 Jonaraja tells us that being advised by 
Hindu Khan he executed Sikandar Khan and his mlechchha fol¬ 
lowers for treason. 25 

The Sultan founded several towns one of which was named after 
him and another, after his favourite queen, Lakshml. Unfortunately 
he was bewitched by the beauty of Lasa, daughter of Lakshml’s sister, 
and married her. At her instigation the Sultan banished his two 
sons by Lakshmi, Iiasan and 'All, who took refuge in the Delhi 
court and distinguished themselves by their prowess. 26 Just before 
his death he evidently repented of his folly and recalled them, but 
as they did not arrive in time, he nominated his younger brother 
as his successor. The elder, Hasan, had started for Kashmir, but 
before he could reach his father the latter died, and his younger 
brother Hindal or Hindu Khan ascended the throne under the name 
Qutb-ud-dln (vv. 532-39). 

The new Sultan was generous enough to request Hasan to con¬ 
tinue his march, and received him cordially when he arrived at 
Kashmir. But as usually happens, evil-minded persons fomented a 
spirit of jealousy and hostility between the two. Hasan was induc¬ 
ed to plot against the Sultan, but the scheme failed and Hasan fled 
the country (v. 616). 

On the death of Qutb-ud-din about A.D. 1389, his infant son 
Sikandar ascended the throne. The queen-mother Subhata (v. 667) 
probably administered the kingdom as regent with the help of 
Uddaka, son of her maternal uncle (v. 655), and put down tumults 
and revolts with a stern hand. By her order Uddaka put to death 
even her own daughter and son-in-law, presumably for plotting 
against the king (v. 668). The king, wdien he attained majority 
and assumed the powers of administration in his own hands, was 
faced by the rebellion of Uddaka, mentioned above, who had con¬ 
quered Baltistan and then turned against his master. 263 The rebel¬ 
lion was put down. The king also obtained some military successes. 
He subdued the Shahi chief of Ohind and married his daughter Mera. 
During his reign Timur invaded India. According to Jonaraja, 
Timur was afraid of the king of Kashmir and presented him two 
elephants. But a more probable and detailed account of the friendly 
relation between the two is given by Firishta and Nizam-ud-dln. 

Sikandar’s reign marks a turning-point in the history of Kashmir 
from social and religious point of view. It appears that although 


377 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the rulers were Muslims the State was hitherto predominantly 
Hindu, and even the Muslim kings and peoples were not very ortho¬ 
dox in their belief. This is proved, among other things, by the 
Hindu names like Lakshml and Sobha borne by the queens, conse¬ 
cration of a golden ling a by the latter (v. 671), and the performance 
of a yajna (sacrifice) by Qutb-ud-dln to avert famine (v. 637). This 
was probably due to the paucity of Muslims in the country. But 
a great change took place during the reign of Sikandar. A large 
immigration of Muslims from outside flooded the country, and there 
seems to be little doubt that they brought with them that fanatic 
iconoclastic zeal which distinguished Islam in other parts of India, 
but from which Kashmir was happily free up to this time. This 
follows from the detailed account of Jonaraja from which the fol¬ 
lowing extracts are quoted: 

“The king had a fondness for the Yavanas.Many Yavanas 

left other sovereigns and took shelter under this king who was re¬ 
nowned for charity. Muhammada of Mera country became their 
(that is, ef the Yavanas) chief. The king waited on him daily, 
humble as a servant, and like a student he daily took his lessons 
from him. He placed Muhammada before him, and was attentive 
to him like a slave. As the wind destroys the trees, and the locusts 
the salt crop, so did the Yavanas destroy the usages of Kasmira. 
Attracted by the gifts and honours which the king bestowed, and 
by his kindness, the mlechchhas entered Kasmira even as locusts 
enter a good field of corn.” They occupied all the offices of the 
State and became friends of the king. 27 

Sikandar evidently learnt his lessons well, and his reign was 
disgraced by a series of acts, inspired by religious bigotry and icono¬ 
clastic zeal, for which there is hardly any parallel even in the annals 
of the Muslim rulers of India. His minister, Suhabhatta, who had 
abjured Hindu faith for Islam, and was “instructed by the 
mlechchhas, instigated the king to break down the images of gods”. 
Whether the king required any such instigation after the lessons 
he had learnt at the feet of Muhammada of Mera, cannot be defi¬ 
nitely said. In any case there cannot be any doubt that Suha- 
bhatta’s advice fell on willing ears. The result is thus described by 
Jonaraja: “The king forgot his kingly duties and took a delight day 

and night, in breaking images.He broke the images of 

Martanda, Vishaya, Isana, Chakrabhrit and Tripuresvara. 

There was no city, no town, no village, no wood where Suha the 
Turushka left the temples of gods unbroken.” 28 

But this was not all. An attempt was made to destroy the 
caste of the Brahmanas by force, and those who resisted it were 


378 





KASHMIR 


subjected to heavy fines. 29 The Muslim version of the activities of 
Sikandar is given in detail by Firishta who, of course, includes 
them among his “good institutions’". According to Firishta, Sikan¬ 
dar issued “orders proscribing the residence of any person other than 
Muhammadans in Kashmir; and he required that no man should 
wear the mark on his forehead, or any woman be permitted to 
burn with her husband’s corpse. Lastly, he insisted on all the golden 
and silver images being broken and melted down, and the metal 
coined into money”. 29a No one can fail to be struck with the con¬ 
trast between Kashmir under Shihab-ud-dm and Sikandar and note 
that much water had flown down the Vitasta during a quarter of 
a century. Firishta continues: “Many of the Brahmins, rather than 
abandon their religion or their country, poisoned themselves; some 
emigrated from their native homes, while a few escaped the evil 
of banishment by becoming Muhammadans. After the emigration 
of the Brahmins, Sikandar ordered all the temples in Kashmir to 
be thrown down.” Some temples were levelled with the ground, 
and in one case, we are told that Sikandar, who was personally 
present, did not desist till the building was entirely razed to the 
ground, and its foundations dug up. The Muslim historians inform 
us that for having broken the Hindu temples Sikandar got the title 
of Butshikan, or the destroyer of idols. Immediately after this 
Firishta remarks: “Among other good institutions of Sikandar was 
the prohibition of vending wine, and the relinquishment of all 
export duties.” 30 

It has been urged by some that it was not the Sultan but Suha- 
bhatta and other converts who were responsible for the religious 
persecution. 31 But, as Jonaraja has observed in this connection, 
it is an established rule, that the master is responsible for the 
fault of his servant. 32 Besides, the account of Firishta, quoted 
above, makes it clear that Sikandar was not as innocent in the mat¬ 
ter as is pretended by his supporters, for he personally supervised 
the demolition of temples and, in at least one case, he was not 
satisfied by merely razing a temple to the ground, but saw to it that 
its foundations were dug up. This one instance, if true, is sufficient 
to prove his personal zeal and bigotry. After all, it was not Suha- 
bhatta but Sikandar who was honoured by his co-religionists with 
the sobriquet Butshikan (destroyer of idols). 

Sikandar died in A.D. 1413 and was succeeded by his son Mir 
Khan who assumed the name ‘All Shah. The king, at the begin¬ 
ning of his reign, left the management of affairs in the hands of 
Suhabhatta who remained the Chief Minister till his death and con¬ 
tinued his policy of persecuting the Hindus. According to Nizam- 
ud-din, he perpetrated various kinds of oppressions and tyranny 


379 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


on the people, with the result that most of the Hindus left the 
country and some killed themselves. 33 Firishta writes: “That 
statesman (Suhabhatta), with all the zeal of a convert, persecuted 
the few Brahmins who still remained firm to their religion; and by 
putting all to death who refused to embrace Mohamedanism, he 
drove those who still lingered in Kashmir entirely out of that 
kingdom.” 34 

Jonaraja gives more details. He begins by saying that while 
Sikandar put some limits to the persecution of the Hindus, these 
were now exceeded and there was no restraint. What he probably 
means is that, while the religious bigotry in the preceding reign 
took the forms mainly of destroying temples and demolishing the 
images of gods, Suhabhatta now more violently persecuted the 
Brahmanas. He imposed a fine or inflicted punishment ( danda ) on 
the Brahmanas and forbade religious scarifices and processions 
( yoga-yatrcidi ). Lest the Brahmanas leave the country to avoid the 
oppression and maintain their caste, orders were issued that no one 
might leave Kashmir without a passport, so that Suhabhatta might 
torment the Brahmanas as a fisherman torments the fish after put¬ 
ting them in a net in river. In spite of the regulation, some left 
the country by unfrequented roads. As to the rest, some tried to 
save themselves by putting on Muslim dress, while others put an 
end to their lives by fire, poison, drowning, hanging and jumping 
from a precipice. In order to put a stop to Hindu learning, Suha¬ 
bhatta stopped the allowances of the Brahmanas, who had to move 
from door to door, like dogs, for food. It is interesting to note that 
Suhabhatta maintained that all these he did out of his regard for 
Islamic faith, and not out of any malice towards the Brahmanas 
(vv. 863-81). 

A series of rebellions, in which a son of Sikandar played some 
part, disturbed the reign of ‘All Shah, but all were suppressed. 
Later, the king left the country on a pilgrimage, leaving his brother 
Shahi Khan in charge of the country. But ‘All Shah’s father-in- 
law, the king of Jammu 35 , reproached him and induced him to re¬ 
turn with an army from Jammu. Shahi Khan w 7 as glad at his 
brother’s return, but was angry at the arrival of the foreign 
army with him. He returned the kingdom to his brother 
but left Kashmir with the Thakkuras and went to Jasrath, the 
chief of the Khokkaras (w. 928-31). The king asked him to re¬ 
turn, but he refused. Thereupon ‘All Shah led an expedition 
against Jasrath for having given shelter to his brother, but was 
defeated. His end is not known, but according to late accounts 
‘All Shah was captured by the Khokkaras and died at Chadura. 36 


380 


KASHMIR 


2. Zain-ul-‘Abidin to Nazuk Shah 

Shahl Khan ascended the throne in A.D. 1420 under the title 
of Zain-urAbidin. He is the greatest Sultan of Kashmir and 
some have even compared him to Akbar. 37 Under him the boundary 
of the Sultanate of Kashmir reached its greatest extent, the country 
became prosperous, and the Hindus were treated with a catholicity 
worthy of the great Mughul Emperor. 

The second part of the Rajataranghii was written by Jonaraja 
during his reign. We learn from this work that his suzerainty 
extended over Gandhara, Sindhu, Madra, and Rajapuri. He defeat¬ 
ed the king of Udabhandapura several times, though the latter was 
helped by the king of Sindhu. He also carried his victorious arms 
to Gogga country in Bhotta-desa (Guge in Ladakh), and to another 
place named Saya (probably Shell above Leh, on the Sindhu) where 
he saved a golden image of Buddha from the Yavanas (presumably 
his own soldiers). He was assisted in his campaigns by Jasrath, 
the Khokhar chief, who defeated the king of Madra named Maladeva 
and captured him, but released him by the order of the Sultan. 
Nizam-ud-dm also states that “Jasrat Khokkar, aided by the Sultan’s 
power, brought the whole of the Panjab into his possession although 
he could not conquer Delhi. Tibet and the whole country which 
is situated on the bank of the river Sind came into Sultan’s 
possession”. 38 

The Muslim chronicles refer to constant light of Jasrath with 
the ruler of Jammu, and mention that he defeated and killed in 
battle Raja Bhim of Jammu, who had all along supported the 
Sultans of Delhi. 39 We are further told that several times Jasrath 
was defeated and took refuge in the hills. Jonaraja also tells us 
that Zain-ul-‘Abidin gave shelter to Jasrath when he was hard 
pressed by the lord of Delhi (v. 1009). The beginning of hostility 
between Jasrath and the king of Jammu may be traced to the fight 
for succession between ‘All Shah and Zain-ul-‘AbidIn, and it is 
natural, therefore, that Zain-ul-‘Abidin would support Jasrath in 
the latter’s fight with the Sultans of Delhi, while the king of Jammu, 
whose son-in-law was deprived of his throne by Zain-ul-‘Abidm, 
would ally himself with the Sultans of Delhi. 

Jonaraja died in the 35th year of the reign of Zain-ul-‘Abidin, 
and his history was continued by his pupil Srlvara. Both these 
historians of Kashmir testify to the great qualities of the Sultan. 

The fame of Zain-ul- £ Abidin rests mainly on his peaceful acti¬ 
vities. He was a learned man, well versed in Persian, Sanskrit, 


381 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Tibetan and other languages. He had many Arabic and Persian 
works translated into the local language, and the Mahabharata and 
the Rdjataranginl into Persian. He was also a very successful 
administrator. He founded several new cities, built many bridges, 
and dug many irrigation canals which increased the prosperity of 
his subjects. He also prevented the local governors from exacting 
illegal cesses, and gave the peasantry much needed taxation relief. 
He himself took great pains to find out the truth in all complicated 
cases and obtained repute for his Solomon-like dispensation of 
justice. 40 

The Sultan’s household expenditure was met by the proceeds 
of the copper mines. He issued orders that merchants should not 
hide their commodities and should sell them at a small profit, and 
that rates of different commodities should be engraved on thin 
copper-plates and publicly shown in all cities. Whenever a robbery 
or theft was committed, the village headman was fined and this 
system is said to have prevented crimes. 41 

Zain-ul-‘Abidin tried by all possible means to undo the great 
wrongs that his two predecessors had done to the Hindus. Firishta 
has described his activities in the following words: “Preliminary 
to all other measures, he recalled the Brahmins who had been ex¬ 
pelled, and caused a general toleration of all religions to be publicly 
notified. Temples were again permitted to be built, and each indi¬ 
vidual worshipped his God agreeably to the faith in which he was 
educated”. 42 Jonaraja also says that the king restored the old 
usages destroyed (by the late kings) (v. 979), including the grant 
of stipends to learned Brahmanas (v. 1082). 

But the Sultan went still further. He stopped the practice of 
Hindu widows procreating sons by others (or remarrying) at the 
bidding of her husband’s kinsmen, and also the practice of disallow¬ 
ing the daughters with children, of persons dying without leaving 
any male issue, to perform funeral oblations, which, though con¬ 
trary to Hindu law, was followed by the covetous kinsmen of the 
deceased. It also appears that he stopped the killing of cows by 
means of poison, and passed some regulations about eating beef, 
but the sense of the verses is not quite clear (vv. 1079-81). Nizam- 
ud-din also says that the Sultan “took an agreement from the 
Brahmans, that they would not act in contravention of what was 
written in their books”. 43 All these evidently show that the Sultan, 
as before, imposed on the Hindus the personal law as laid down in 
their sdstras (scriptures). 

Zain-ul- £ Abidin was one of the most enlightened Muslim kings 
of India. His court was a meeting place of Hindu and Muslim 


382 


KASHMIR 


scholars, poets, and religious men. He was also greatly interested 
in music and other arts. 44 Nizam-ud-dln states that muskets were 
manufactured in Kashmir during his reign. 45 

His fame as a great ruler spread outside Kashmir. Buhlul 
Lodi, Mahmud Begarha, Mandalika, the last Hindu king of 
Saurashtra, and the king of Gwalior maintained friendly relations 
with him. Even the rulers of Mecca, Egypt, Gilan and Khurasan 
exchanged presents with him. 

The last days of this great monarch were embittered by the 
rebellions of his three sons, Adam Khan, Haji Khan and Bahram 
Khan, but he took energetic measures to crush them. He died in 
c. A.D. 1470, and was succeeded by his son Haji Khan under the 
title Haidar Shah. 

Haidar Shah was in every respect a contrast to his father. He 
was a notorious drunkard, and for some time left the administra¬ 
tion in the hands of a Hindu barber called Purna. 45a Puma tor- 

• • 

tured people in various ways including mutilation and impaling. 
The king also persecuted the Brahmanas and resumed the lands 
granted to them by Zain-ul-‘AbidIn. Taking advantage of the dis¬ 
content and confusion, Adam Khan made an attempt to seize the 
throne, but was killed in a fight with the Mughuls. 

Haidar sent an expedition under his eldest son, possibly to bring 
under subjugation the kings of Rajapuri, Madra and Khokkara who 
had probably declared their independence after the death of Zain- 
ul-‘Abidm. 

Haidar enjoyed a very short reign, a little over one year, and 
died as a result of injuries sustained when his feet slipped in a glass 
pavilion. 

On the death of Haidar Shah, his brother Bahram made an at¬ 
tempt to seize the throne, but his attempt was foiled by a minister 
called Malik Ahmad 46 who set up Haidar’s son Hasan as the king. 

Hasan established his capital at Nowshera. He was an indo¬ 
lent king and left the administration in the hands of the powerful 
nobles. Bahram Khan revolted but was defeated and taken captive. 
He was blinded and died as a result. 

The reign of Hasan was full of feuds among the nobles. A 
party, headed by his father-in-law, Sayyid Hasan, became very 
powerful. Three nobles, namely, Taj Bhat or Yarl Bhat, Nur Bhat 
and Malik Ahmad also became very powerful. i\ccording to Srlvara, 
Taj forced some feudatories of the kingdom of Delhi to pay tribute. 


383 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The king appointed Taj Bhat and Nur Bhat as the guardians of his 
eldest son, Muhammad, and second son, Hasan, respectively. Malik 
Ahmad, who was probably the father of Nur Bhat, joined hands 
with Sayyid Hasan, but shortly afterwards the Sayyid captured 
power and threw T Malik Ahmad and others into prison. 

Hasan v/as powerless to stop the evils, and was completely 
dominated by his wife, whose father was the leader of the ruling 
group. Hasan, however, revived all the liberal rules and regula¬ 
tions of Zain-ul-‘Abidin which had been abolished by Haidar Shah. 
He also turned his energies to erecting monuments, and his court 
historian, Sri vara, states that he (Srivara) has described these build¬ 
ings in another work lest it would increase the bulk of the present 
one, that is the third Rdjatarangim. 47 The queen and the nobles 
also erected many edifices and Srivara states that the queen built 
a masiiddm-ajiro-ddram, probably a mosque with a thousand doors. 

Hasan was also very fond of music and the historian Srivara, 
being an accomplished musician, was highly appreciated by the king 
who bestowed on him lavish gifts. 

A curious incident mentioned by Srivara is that “the King 
(Hasan) found that the dinar as of SrI-Toramana had ceased to be 
current and he gave currency to new coins (double dlndras) which 
were impressed with the figure of a serpent”. 48 

Before Hasan’s death, he requested his father-in-law, Sayyid 
Hasan, to set up the son of Adam Khan ( a son of Zainul-ul-‘AbidIn) 
on the throne. But the Sayyid paid no heed to the king’s request, 
and after Hasan’s death, which took place about A.D. 1484, set up on 
the throne the latter’s son, Muhammad, by his own daughter. 

The power and prestige of the kingdom, which had been rudely 
shaken during the reigns of Haidar and Hasan, collapsed altogether 
wdth the accession of Muhammad, a boy of seven. He is probably the 
only king known in history who lost his throne thrice, but managed 
to regain it every time, and died as a king after his fourth accession. 
He did not gain his throne even once by his own exertions, but 
owed it to the favour of the nobles who merely used him as a pawn. 
Two parties of nobles became very powerful at this time; the 
Muslim historians call them Chaks and the Makrls, but they are 
referred to as the Chakresas and Margesas in the Rdjatarangim. 
It is possible that the Margesas were hereditary guardians of the 
valleys or wardens of the marches, and that their official surname 
v/as Persianized into MakrI. Chakresa also may have been an occu¬ 
pational surname derived from some hereditary office, the nature of 
which it is difficult to determine now. However, these two families 


384 


KASHMIR 


dominate the history of Kashmir for the remaining period, till the 
Chaks establish themselves on the throne. 

It would be convenient to indicate here the relation of the suc¬ 
cessors of Hasan before describing the history of their reigns.

Srivara, the contemporary author, has left a detailed and vivid 
account of the earlier part of the reign of Muhammad and the 
sufferings of the people under the rapacious nobles. The Sayyids, 
who controlled the government, have been violently denounced for 
their misgovernment by Srivara, but it is apparent from his descrip¬ 
tion that the ministers and nobles who succeeded them were no 
better, and the people of Kashmir passed through terrible misery 
till the annexation of the province by Akbar. 

Within a few months after the accession of Muhammad, most 
of the Sayyid leaders were assassinated, and Jahangir Makri, who 
had been exiled in the previous reign by Sayyid Hasan, returned 
and captured power after exterminating the remaining Sayyids. 
Shortly afterwards, Fath Khan, the son of Adam Khan, invaded 
Kashmir. Fath Khan was helped by Hasan Khan, the son of Tatar 
Khan, the Lodi governor of the Punjab. The lord of Rajauri also 
helped Fath Khan, but the latter was defeated by Jahangir Makri. 
Soon there was a rising in Kashmir and Fath Khan again invaded 
Kashmir. Fath Khan conquered twenty-seven vishayas (districts) 
of Kashmir and, conquering Madra, gave it to the king of Rajapuri. 
The distress at this time was very acute and the miserable people, 
forced to eat the lotus-stalk, named the dish “Margesa-curry” after 

385 


D.S.— 25 


















THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Jahangir Makri (Margesa); half a pala of salt was sold for twenty-five 
dindras. 

Next year (A.D. 1486) Fath invaded Kashmir for the third 
time, and after several trials of strength, his army, led by Saifa 
Damara, completely defeated Jahangir, who left Kashmir and died 
in exile. Fath then ascended the throne but took good care of 
Muhammad. 

The victory of Fath Khan did not end the misery of the people. 
The foreign soldiery plundered the country while three new 
ministers, Musarajanaka or Somarajanaka, Haji Mia, and Ibrahim 
Makri shared the power of government. During this time Mir 
Shams, the founder of the Nur Bakshi sect, came to Kashmir and 
his preachings led to some trouble. 

Fath gradually lost all power, and was forced by his first two 
ministers to divide Kashmir into three parts, one for himself and 
the other two for the two ministers. Ibrahim Makri, however, 
challenged the power of this group, defeated them and installed 
Muhammad on the throne (A.D. 1495). But this restoration lasted 
only for about nine months, after which Fath recaptured the throne 
(A.D. 1496) and ruled for nearly twenty years. 49 About A.D. 1515, 
Muhammad and Ibrahim, re-inforced with a large army from 
Sikandar Lodi, attacked Kashmir, and in a battle, fought in the 
following year, so decisively defeated Fath that he fled from Kashmir 
and Muhammad again occupied the throne (A.D. 1516). 

This time KajI Chak became the chief minister of Muhammad 
and seems to have pacified Ibrahim by giving the latter the Siddha 
country with the title of Malik. There was, however, no peace in 
the country which had to suffer from several invasions, one of which 
was headed by Habib Khan, probably the son of Fath Khan. But 
soon the Chaks and the Makrls, who had so long been united, fell 
out and mustered troops. Muhammad changed sides but was ulti¬ 
mately driven out by the Chaks who set up his son Ibrahim on the 
throne in c. A.D. 1528. 

Ibrahim made KajI Chak his chief minister, and the defeated 
Abdal Makri went to Babur, who gave him one thousand soldiers. 
With this help Abdal Mlakri and Fath Khan’s son Nazuk Shah de¬ 
feated KajI Chak who fled away from Kashmir and Nazuk Shah 
was crowned king (c. A.D. 1529). Nazuk divided the kingdom 
among his ministers retaining a portion for himself, but after a 
reign of one year was dethroned. Muhammad then ascended the 
throne for the fourth and last time (A.D. 1530).

D. MINOR STATES 


I. ASSAM 

1. General Political condition 

Towards the close of the thirteenth century A.D., Assam pre¬ 
sented a confused picture of political disintegration. The old 
kingdom of Kamarupa continued under a new name and a new 
dynasty, and with its capital removed to Kamata or Kamatapura, 
situated a little to the south-west of the present town of Cooch 
Behar. The western limit of the kingdom was still, as of old, formed 
by the Karatoya river in Bengal, but the eastern frontier varied 
from time to time. Though at times it extended to the Barnadi, 
and thus included both Goalpara and Kamrup, these two districts 
were often ruled by a number of independent chiefs, known as Baro 
Bhuyas. At the extreme east of Assam, in the Upper Brahmaputra 
Valley, the Shan tribe, known as Ahoms, had consolidated their 
kingdom. They had not only subdued the primitive indigenous 
peoples, but had admitted many of them to their own tribe; their 
number was further increased by fresh immigration of the Shans 
from the north-east. 

Between these two kingdoms in the two extremes lay a number 
of principalities, the chief of which were those of the Chutiyas and 
the Cacharis. 

The Chutiya kingdom lay on both banks of the Brahmaputra to 
the east of the Subarnasri river in the north, and of the Disang 
river in the south. The Chutiyas are now to be found mainly in 
the Lakhimpur District and the adjacent parts of Sibsagar. They 
had come within the fold of Hinduism in remote past, but contain 
a strong admixture of Shan blood. They were ruling with their 
capital at Sadiya at the beginning of the thirteenth century A.D. 
when the Ahoms entered the province. There were frequent wars 
between the two until the Chutiyas were finally subdued by the 
Ahoms at the beginning of the sixteenth century A.D., as will be 
related later. The kingdom of the Cacharis lay to the south-west of 
the Chutiya kingdom. It extended along the south bank of the 
Brahmaputra as far as Nowgong in the west, and up to the valley 
of the Dhansiri river in the south, with an ill-defined boundary 
across the central hills of Assam. 

Between the Chutiya and the Cachari kingdoms in the east 
and that of Kamarupa on the west, the country was parcelled out 
among a number of petty independent chiefs called Bhuyas. As 
mentioned above, they were collectively known as Baro Bhuyas, 
and a strong ruler of Kamarupa could, and often did, establish his 


387 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


supremacy over them. But under a weak ruler the kingdom of 
Kamarupa often failed to exercise any effective control to the east 
of the Sangkosh river, and thus lay wholly outside the limits of 
modern Assam. It must, however, be said to the credit of these 
Bhuyas, that they acted in concert whenever their country was 
threatened by any Muslim invasion. 

2. The Kingdom of Kamata 

The chief interest of the history of Assam during the period 
under review centres round the two kingdoms of Kamata on the 
west, and Ahom in the east. The kingdom of Kamata (var. Kamta) 
is often referred to as Kamrup in Muslim chronicles. This is true 
to some extent only from the point of view of historical succession, 
but the centre of Kamata kingdom and sometimes even its boundary, 
lay outside Kamrup proper, and it is therefore better to designate 
the new kingdom as Kamata rather than Kamrup. 

The histoiy of Kamarupa, after the death of Vallabhadeva, 1 
who was on the throne in A.D. 1185, is very obscure, and the casual 
references to Muslim invasions in Muslim chronicles are all that 
is definitely known to us. Bakhtyar Khalji, Hisam-ud-dm Twaz 
Khalji 2 who had assumed independence in Bengal under the title 
Ghiyas-ud-dm Twaz, and Ikhtiyar-ud-diln Yuzbak Tughril Khan, 3 
also known as Mughis-ud-dln Yuzbak, invaded Kamarupa respec¬ 
tively in A.D. 1205, 1227, and 1257. The first of these campaigns 
ended in a veritable disaster as noted above. 4 No details of the 
second are known; it was probably a mere raid and no permanent 
results were achieved. The third began with phenomenal success 
and the Bengal Sultan occupied the capital without any serious 
opposition. But the ruler of Kamarupa took full advantage of the 
ignorance of the climate and topography of Assam on the part of 
the conquerors. Surrounded by water on all sides and bereft of 
supplies, Mughis-ud-din made a hurried retreat through the sub¬ 
montane tract, by way of the Dooars. He was assailed by the Hindus 
in a narrow pass, and though he fought bravely, he was mor¬ 
tally wounded. His army surrendered and his family fell captive 
into the hands of the Raja of Kamarupa. It was a veritable disaster, 
perhaps unparalleled in the annals of early Muslim history in 
India. 5 

Neither the Muslim chronicles, from which the above account is 
derived, nor the local traditions have preserved the name of this 
brave Hindu king who saved his country from the Muslim invaders 
by his daring and genius. It appears, however, from the detailed 


388 


ASSAM 


description of the campaign that he had still his capital on the 
Brahmaputra, at Gauhati, or its immediate neighbourhood. 

No further light is thrown on the history of Kamarupa by the 
Muslim chronicles till the rise of the kingdom of Kamata. Whether 
this event indicates nothing more than a mere shifting of the capi¬ 
tal, or the rise of a new kingdom under a new dynasty, it is difficult 
to say. But in either case we do not know the cause of the change 
or the circumstances leading to it. We are equally ignorant of the 
early history of this new kingdom. There are a number of legends 
and traditions, but it is difficult to extract any reliable history 
from them. One of these legends refers in detail to Durlabh Nara- 
yan, Raja of Kamata. Ke probably flourished at the end of the 
thirteenth century A.D. and his kingdom extended from the Kara- 
toya, in Bengal, to the Barnadi in Assam. About this time, or shortly 
afterwards, the kingdom was invaded by the Ahoms, and hostilities 
continued for some time. A treaty was however concluded, and 
the alliance between the two was cemented by the marriage of 
Bhajani, the princess of Kamata, with the Ahom king Sukhangpha. 6 

According to tradition, the southern part of the old kingdom 
of Kamarupa, including Mymensingh and Sylhet, was at this time 
under the rule of Dharina Narayan, a cousin of Durlabh Narayan. 
This area was invaded by the Muslim Sultan of Bengal, Sultan 
Shams-ud-dln Flruz, early in the fourteenth century A.D. The 
Muslim army overran Mymensingh District and then, crossing the 
Brahmaputra, occupied Sylhet. This probably took place in 
A.D. 1303. Starting from this base, the Muslim governor and Sultan 
Ghiyas-ud-dln Bahadur Shah conquered Tippera and Chittagong 
Divisions, and these were annexed to the empire of Muhammad bin 
Tughluq early in his reign (A.D. 1326-27). 7 Ilyas Shah invaded the 
Brahmaputra valley and pushed his conquests as far as Kamarupa. 8 
Whether this region acknowledged the authority of the Kamata 
kings or was ruled by the independent or semi-independent chiefs, 
called Bhuyas, is not known with certainty. Epigraphic evidence 
shows that in A.D. 1329 a petty Hindu chief had set himself up as 
an independent ruler in Kamarupa. 9 

The discovery of coins, dated 799 and 802 A.H. and thus be¬ 
longing to the reign of Ghiyas-ud-dln A‘zam Shah, in Cooch Behar 
and Gauhati, 10 prove his authority in Kamarupa. But whether it 
is an indication of the continuance of the Muslim authority since 
the conquest by Ilyas Shah, or is to be explained by the unsuccessful 
expedition of A‘zam Shah mentioned above, 11 cannot be determined 
with certainty. There is, however, no doubt that in spite of 
invasions by the Muslims from the west, and the Ahom king on 


389 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the east, Kamata again became a powerful kingdom, early in the 
fifteenth century, under the Khens, a primitive people who had 
imbibed Brahmanical Hinduism to a large extent. The names of 
the first two kings of this dynasty, Niladhvaja and Chakradhvaja, 
have been preserved only in legendary traditions. The third king 
Nilambara, was, however, undoubtedly a historical figure. He was 
a powerful king and ruled over an extensive territory including 
not only Goalpiara and Kamarupa in the east, but also Mymensingh 
and Sylhet to the south-east, which had been conquered by the 
Muslims. He is said to have constructed a high road from his capital 
Kamatapur (near Cooch Behar) to Ghoraghat on the Karatoya in 
the Rangpur District. The capital city, Kamatapur, at the time 
covered an extensive area whose ruins have been described by 
Hamilton. 

Reference has been made above to his fight with two Muslim 
Sultans of Bengal, Rukn-ud-dln Barbak Shah and ‘Ala-ud-din 
Husain Shah. There is hardly any doubt that Nilambara routed 
the Muslim host of Barbak, and the story of his later defeat by 
supernatural means, and his conversion to Islamic faith are 
merely ingenious attempt to hide the discomfiture of the Muslim 
army. 12 

Local traditions offer an explanation of the outbreak of war bet¬ 
ween Nilambara and Husain Shah. It is said that Nilambara killed his 
Brahman minister’s son for carrying on amorous intrigues with his 
queen. He then cooked the flesh of the dead and made his father 
eat it. The outraged minister left the kingdom under pretext 
of pilgrimage and proceeded to the court of Husain Shah. At his 
instigation Husain Shah sent a big army under Ismafil GhazI who 
besieged the strongly fortified city of Kamata. According to a local 
tradition the siege lasted twelve years, at the end of which the 
Muslim general gained entrance to the fort by means of treachery. 
Nilambara is said to have been captured and taken to Gauda, the 
capital of Bengal, but subsequently effected his escape. 13 

It is difficult to put much faith in the details of this story, but 
there are grounds to believe that Husain Shah gained a complete 
victory and annexed the whole of the Kamata kingdom as far as 
the Barnadi. Hajo, in Kamrup, became the headquarters of the 
Muslim Viceroy, a son of Husain, and gradually the Muslim autho¬ 
rity was established over the chiefs called Bhuyias. The conquest 
of Husain Shah, which extinguished the Hindu kingdom of Kamata, 
may be dated some time between A.D. 1498 and 1502. A little more 
than a decade later a new kingdom—that of Cooch Behar—arose 
out of its ruins. Its history will be described in the next volume.

ASSAM 


3. The Ahom Kingdom 14 

A short account has been given above of the foundation of a 
kingdom by the Ahoms in the north-eastern part of the province 
which still-bears their name (Assam), and its consolidation under 
the first three kings Sukapha, Suteupha, and Subinpha whose reigns 
cover the period from A.D. 1215 to 1293. 14a 

Subinpha’s son and successor Sukhangpha felt powerful enough 
to extend his kingdom at the cost of his neighbours, and launched 
a career of conquest and aggression. The kingdom of Kamata, the 
most powerful rival of the newly risen power, was his first object 
of attack. This trial of strength between the old and the new was 
decided entirely in favour of the latter. After prolonged hostilities, 
in course of which both sides suffered heavy losses, the two parties 
concluded an alliance to which reference has been made above. 

Sukhangpha died in A.D. 1332, and was succeeded by his three 
sons, one after another. The chief event during these three reigns 
(A.D. 1332-89) was a prolonged hostility with the Chutiyas. The next 
king, Sudangpha, ascended the throne in A.D. 1397, after an inter¬ 
regnum of eight years, during which the nobles carried on the 
administration. He fixed his capital at Charguya near the Dihing 
river. The Buranjis or chronicles of the Ahoms, which form our 
principal source of information, have spread a halo of romance 
and mystery round the early life of this king. Though son of the 
third son of Sukhangpha, his mother was cast out and gave birth 
to him in the house of a Brahmana. The new king was for this 
reason known as the “Brahman Prinee’ , , and the Brahmana, who 
gave shelter to his mother, was made his chief adviser. Under the 
influence of this Brahmana and his sons, who also occupied high 
posts, the Ahoms, belonging to the Mongoloid Shan stock, came 
under the influence of Brahmanical Hinduism. The King was faced 
with a conspiracy of the Tipamis, but suppressed it by killing their 
leading chiefs in a treacherous manner. He tried to conciliate the 
Tipamis by marrying the daughter of one of the chiefs, but this 
brought on fresh troubles. For Tai Sulai, one of the Tipami lovers 
of this queen before her marriage, being caught in love intrigues 
with her, sought asylum with Surumpha, king of Mungkang. This 
led to a fight between the two kings, in which the latter was driven 
as far as the Patkai hills. Hostilities were concluded by a treaty 
in A.D. 1401 by which the Patkai Range w^as fixed as the boundary 
between the two kingdoms. 

Tai Sulai now took refuge with the king of Kamata, and so 
Sudangpha sent a military expedition against the latter. But 
though the king of Kamata refused to surrender the fugitive, he 


391 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


conciliated his powerful enemy by giving him his daughter Bhajani 
in marriage. According to some Buranjis, Ghiyas-ud-din A‘zam 
Shah took advantage of the war between Kymata and the Ahom 
kingdom to invade the former. But the two rulers of Assam com¬ 
bined against A‘zam and forced him to retire beyond the KaratOyaA 5 
Sudangpha now turned his attention to the subjugation of the re¬ 
calcitrant tribes who at last submitted to his authority. 

Sudangpha died in A.D. 1407 and was followed by two kings 
whose reigns were uneventful. The next king, Susenpha, who died 
in A.D. 1488 after a reign of forty-nine years, was involved in a 
war with the Tangshu Nagas which was renewed during the reign 
of his successor Suhenpha. In spite of some initial successes, the 
Nagas were ultimately defeated. Suhenpha was less successful in 
his war with the Cacharis who defeated the Ahom army at Dampuk 
on the bank of the Dikhu river. Suhenpha sued for peace and sent 
a princess to the Cachari King. Suhenpha was assassinated in 1493 , 
and his son Supimpha also probably shared the same fate four years 
later. His son Suhungmung ascended the throne in 1497 and as¬ 
sumed the Hindu name Svarga Narayan. This is an index of the 
gradually increasing hold of Brahmanical Hinduism upon this Shan 
royal family and the people. The new king transferred his capital 
from Charguya to Bakata on the Dihing. The Aitonia Nagas re¬ 
volted in 1504, but were defeated and forced to acknowledge the 
supremacy of the Ahom king and to pay him annual tribute. Eight 
years later the Ahom king annexed the Habung country. Then 
followed a prolonged war with the Chutiyas which lasted for more 
than ten years (1513 to 1523 ). In spite of occasional reverses, 
Suhungmung ultimately triumphed and annexed the whole of the 
Chutiyia country, which henceforth formed a part and parcel of 
the Ahom kingdom. To complete the assimilation between the two, 
three hundred Ahom families, with twelve chiefs, were settled in 
Sadiya, and another Ahom colony was set up on the banks of the 
Dihing. On the other hand, the royal family and the leading chiefs 
of the Chutiyas were taken to Bakariguri, and a number of Brah- 
manas, blacksmiths and other classes of artisans from Sadiya were 
settled in the Ahom capital. Early in 1527 , and again in 1529 , 
the Chutiyas made serious efforts to regain their independence, but 
the revolts were put down without much difficulty. 

In the meantime Suhungmung led an expedition against the 
Cacharis in 1526, and advanced into their country as far as Maiham 
or Kathkatia. The Cacharis obtained a temporary success and re¬ 
occupied the place, but they were forced to retreat, and closely 
pursued by the Ahoms. Though the Cacharis fought with courage 


392 


ASSAM 


and valour they sustained a decisive defeat. After a temporary 
truce, hostilities were renewed in 1531. Suhungmung advanced up 
to the Dhansiri river and, after defeating the Cacharis in several 
engagements, occupied their capital Dimapur. The Cachari king 
fled with his son, and a prince named Detsung, who had given his 
sister to the Ahom king, was set up on the throne. But Detsung 
having proved contumacious, an Ahom army again invaded Cachar 
and occupied the capital Dimapur. Detsung fled, but was seized and 
put to death. His death put an end to all resistance, and the whole of 
the Dhansiri valley and the Cachari territories north of the Kollang 
river in Nowgong District passed into the hands of the Ahom king. 

The most important event during the reign of Suhungmung 
was his fight with the Muslim State of Bengal. Unfortunately, the 
difference between the Ahom Buranjis and the Muslim chronicles 
makes it difficult to obtain a clear view of the whole episode in 
its true perspective. 

According to the Riydz-us-Salatin, ‘Ala-ud-dln Husain Shah 
followed up his conquest of Kiamata-Kamarqpa kingdom, men¬ 
tioned above, by an invasion of Assam. “The Raja of Assam, not 
being able to oppose him, relinquishing his country, fled to the 
mountains. The king (Husain Shiah), leaving his son with a large 
army to complete the settlement of the conquered country, returned 
triumphant and victorious to Bengal. After the withdrawal of the 
king, his son devoted himself to the pacification and defences of the 
conquered country. But when the rainy season set in, owing to 
floods, the roads and tracks became closed; and the Rajah with his 
adherents issued from the hills, surrounded the Royal army, engaged 
in warfare, cut off supplies of provisions, and in a short time put 
all to the sword”. 16 There is nothing improbable in the alleged in¬ 
vasion of the upper Brahmaputra valley by Husain Shah; it fits in 
well with the general policy of Muslim rulers to carry forward the 
banner of Islam into the country of the infidels wherever possible; 
also with the imperial ambitions and aggressive designs of Husain 
Shah narrated above. Besides, although the Riydz was a late 
compilation of the eighteenth century, it is corroborated by 
Shihab-ud-dln Talish who refers to the invading army of Husain Shah 
as consisting of 24,000 soldiers (horse and foot) and numerous 
ships. 17 

On the other hand, the Ahom Buranjis give the date of the 
first Muslim invasion of Assam as A.D. 1527, and their detailed 
accounts substantially corroborate the statement in the Riydz that 
in spite of some initial successes the Muslim invaders were com¬ 
pletely routed. 


393 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


As Husain Shah died in 1519, the invasion of 1527 must be 
credited to his son and successor, Nusrat Shah. It is, therefore, 
held by some historians 18 that the author of the Riyaz erroneously 
regarded the expedition against Kamata in 1498-1502, and that 
against Assam in 1527, as part of the same operations, whereas they 
were really undertaken by two different Sultans, Husain and Nusrat, 
with an interval of twenty-five years. This seems to be more rea¬ 
sonable than the view that the Ahom kingdom was invaded first by 
Husain Shah after he completed the conquest of Kamata (1498-1502), 
and next by his son Nusrat Shah in 1527 or 1529 19 For the Riydz 
mentions only one invasion of Assam, during the reign of Husain 
Shah, and does not refer to any such invasion by Nusrat. So either 
his account rightly applies to Husain’s reign, or may be regarded 
as a confusion with what took place during the next reign. But 
it would be illogical to apply it to both. 

On the whole, it seems much safer to follow the account of 
the Ahom Buranjis which have preserved a detailed account of the 
protracted military operations. It may be summed up as follows: 20 
In 1527 the Muslim army invaded Assam under the great wazlr, 
but was defeated on all fronts by the Ahoms who pursued it 
as far as the Burai river and captured forty horses and from twenty 
to forty cannon. In 1529 the Ahom king took the offensive and 
obtained some success. Two years later, the Muslims renewed 
hostilities and advanced up the Brahmaputra with fifty ships. But 
they were defeated by the Ahoms in a naval battle at Temani or 
Trimohani in Sibsagar District, a little below the point where the 
main channel of the Brahmaputra bifurcates into two to form the 
Majuli island, and lost their ships. The Ahoms now fortified two 
advance posts, one at Sala, on the bank of the Bharali, and another 
at Singiri, further down the Brahmaputra at its junction with a 
smaller river. A large Muslim force attacked Singiri, but was com¬ 
pletely routed and fled, being hotly pursued as far as Khagarijan 
(Nowgong). The Muslim commander Bit Malik was among the 
slain, and fifty horses, with many guns, fell into the hands of the 
Ahoms. In 1532 another strong Muslim force, led by Turbak, sta¬ 
tioned itself opposite Singiri, and was attacked by the Ahom army 
under the command of Suklen, son of the Ahom king Suhungmung. 
The prince was completely defeated and fell back upon Sala; eight 
of his commanders were killed, and he himself was wounded. 

The Muslim army advanced along the south bank of the 
Brahmaputra as far as Koliabar, opposite Tezpur, and halted there 
for the rainy season. In October the Muslims surrounded the fort 
of Sala, the headquarters of the Ahom forces led by Suklen, and 


394 


ASSAM 


defeated them on several occasions. But the Ahoms obtained a 
great naval victory at Duimunisila, in Nowgong District, a little 
above Koliabar, in March, 1533. According to the Buranjis, the 
Muslims lost twenty-two ships, a number of guns, and between 
1,500 and 2,500 soldiers. 

The two armies were now entrenched, face to face, on the 
opposite banks of the Dikrai river, near its mouth. After several 
months of inactivity the Ahoms took the offensive and defeated the 
Muslim army in several engagements ending in a complete rout near 
the Bharali. Turbak himself fell in the fight, and the Ahoms pur¬ 
sued the Muslim fugitives as far as the Karatoya river in Bengal. 
During the pursuit another Muslim general, Husain Khan, was 
caught and killed, and the victors captured 28 elephants, 850 horses 
together with a large number of guns, and a large quantity of gold 
and silver. 

The real status of Turbak has been doubted by Gait who thinks 
that he was a mere freelance or a local chief, and the army led 
by him was not the royal force, but a local levy. The only ground 
for this supposition seems to be the fact that, before returning 
from Bengal, the Ahom Commander sent an envoy, with presents, 
to the Sultan of Bengal at Gaur, and he returned with a princess 
for the Ahom king. But it is a very unusual conjecture, unsupported 
by any positive evidence, and belied, among others, by the fact that 
Turbak received re-inforcement before he entrenched himself on 
the Dikrai. Besides, the political condition of Bengal, after the 
assassination of Nusrat in 1532, sufficiently explains the complete 
discomfiture of the Muslim army, and there is no need to look for 
any other explanation. We should also remember that this was 
neither the first nor the last occasion, on which the Muslim invaders 
of Assam learnt, to their cost, that it was much easier to conquer 
than to retain this frontier province. 

It reflects great credit upon the Ahom king that, even while 
engaged in fighting with the Chutiyas and the Cacharis, as noted 
above, he could successfully resist the Muslim invaders. The 
credit is all the greater because the Ahoms were as yet unacquaint¬ 
ed with the use of fire-arms and fought against the Muslims, who 
possessed guns, with only swords, spears, and bows and arrows. 
But the Ahom king was quick to learn, and henceforth used the 
new weapon for subduing the unruly tribes. Guns were used 
against the Nagas who had rebelled in 1535 and 1536; in spite of 
some initial successes they submitted to the Ahom authority. 

The reign of Suhungmung forms an important landmark in the 
history of Assam. He extended the power of the Ahoms in all 


395 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


directions, and his valiant resistance to the Muslims gave immunity 
to Assam from further Muslim aggression for well-nigh hundred 
and thirty years. His reign is also remarkable not only for the rapid 
Hinduization of the Ahoms but also for the spread of a reformed 
Vaishnava doctrine associated with the name of Sahkaradeva. 

The great King had a tragic end. His last days were clouded 
by the defiant attitude of the crown prince Suklen. The latter was 
mightily offended when his father married three captive Cachari 
princesses whom he himself loved. Other causes of estrangement 
followed, till Suklen had his royal father assassinated in A.D. 1539. 
Thus died one of the greatest rulers of Assam,—the builder of the 
Ahom power,—after a glorious reign of forty-two years. 

II. MITHILA (TIRHUT) 

While the whole of the Gangetic valley was submerged by the 
flood of Turk-Muslim invasions, the small Hindu principality of 
Tirhut, the far-famed Mithila or Videha of old, bounded by the 
Himalayas on the north and the three rivers, the Kosi, the Gandak, 
and the Ganga respectively on the east, west and south, 1 kept it¬ 
self afloat like a tiny island in the sea. Though occasional floods 
submerged it from time to time, it always raised its head again, and 
remained, at the beginning of the fourteenth century, the last free 
stronghold of Hinduism in the vast stretch of land extending from 
the Sindhu to the Karatoya. 

Reference has been made above to the foundation of a new 
ruling dynasty in Mithila by Nanyadeva of Karnataka origin, in 
A.D. 1097. This family was ruling over Tirhut when the Muslim 
Turkish invaders swept over the whole of North India. 2 Tirhut was 
not altogether immune from their attack. 3 Apart from occasional 
plundering raids, Sultan Hisam-ud-dm or Ghiyas-ud-din ‘Iwaz Khaljl, 
who had assumed sovereign status in Bengal some time before 
A.D. 1225, is said to have received tribute from Bang, Kamrud and 
Tirhut. 4 But this vague claim is not supported by the account of 
any actual invasion. Another rebellious governor of Bengal, Tughan 
Khan alias ‘Izz-ud-dln Tughril, who had advanced into Awadh and 
seized the town, made an inroad into Tirhut and acquired much 
valuable booty, but no submission (A.D. 1243-4). 15 The political 
condition of Tirhut during the rule of such powerful Sultans as 
Iltutmish, 6 Balban, 7 and ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl 8 cannot be determined 
with certainty. 

Barring occasional raids and temporary occupation of parts, or 
even assertion of nominal suzerainty by some Sultans, Tirhut seems 


396 



MITHILA 


to have escaped the fury of Muslim attack. This is particularly note¬ 
worthy for two reasons. In the first place, though the principality 
lay on the way from Delhi or Awadh to Lakhnawatl, the Muslim 
forces seem to have systematically avoided it. Secondly, Tirhut 
was the refuge of orthodox Hinduism which it was the declared 
policy of Islam to stamp out, wherever possible. Tirhut seems to 
have possessed a charmed life. Arguments based on geographical 
factors have been advanced to explain the immunity of Tirhut from 
Muslim attack, 9 but they cannot be taken very seriously. But 
whatever might have been the cause, the Karnataka rulers of 
Mithila maintained their independence, while every other Hindu 
principality in the Gangetic valley crashed beneath the heels of 
Turkish cavalry. 

The Karnataka kings ruled in Mithila in an unbroken line of 
succession throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A.D. 
There are, however, slight discrepancies in the names of kings and 
order of succession as given by different authorities. The most 
reliable seems to be the list given above 10 on the authority of the 
inscription of Pratapamalla. The name of Bhupalasimha of this 
list is, how r ever, omitted in other sources, and Saktisimha appears 
as Sakrasimha in some of them. All the lists end with Harisimha 
(also written as Harasiihha) as the last ruler of this dynasty in 
Tirhut. The regnal periods vary in different lists. 

Next to Nanyadeva, Harisimha was the most important ruler, 
and his reign forms a landmark in the history of Tirhut. Unlike 
his predecessors, who are mostly shadowy figures of whom very 
little is known, certain broad facts about Harisimha are established 
on unimpeachable authority. He had his capital at a place called 
Simaramapura, 11 modern Simraon in Nepal, on the borderland just 
outside the north-eastern boundary of the District of Champaran. 12 
Three generations of able ministers, namely, Chandesvara, his father 
VIresvara, and his grandfather Devaditya, all served as Mahd - 
sandhi-vigrahikas (Minister of Peace and War) of Harisimha. 13 It 
is mentioned in contemporary literature that Chandesvara con¬ 
quered Nepal for his master, and performed the great religious gift 
of tuld-purusha (gift of gold of the donor’s weight) in November, 
1314 1 4 This gives us a valuable datum for fixing the lowest limit 
of the date of Harisiriiha’s accession. In view of the fact that 
Chandesvara, who served him in A.D. 1314, was preceded by his 
father and grandfather in the same post, we may assume that 
according to all reasonable probability, Harisimha ascended the 
throne during the eighties of the thirteenth century A.D., if not 

earlier. 


397 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


This is, however, opposed to the traditional account of Sakra- 
siriiha, who was the predecessor and father of Harisiriiha according 
to the Mithila tradition. The inscription of Pratapamalla, however, 
calls him Saktisiriiha and places a king Bhupalasiriiha between him 
and Harisimhadeva. It has been suggested by some that as neither 
the literary tradition nor any other evidence corroborates this, 
Bhupalasiriiha was the elder brother of Harisiriiha and probably 
never ascended the throne. 15 This gratuitous assumption has been 
rendered necessary by a Mithila tradition that Sakrasiriiha helped 
‘Ala-ud-din Khaljl “in his fight against Hammlra (Hambira) of 
Ranathambhapura”. 16 There are other traditions according to 
which the Muslims invaded Mithila in 697 A.H. (A.D. 1297-8) and 
arrested the King. 17 None of these traditions is, however, support¬ 
ed by Muslim chronicles or any other reliable evidence. As the 
invasion of Ranthambhor took place in A.D. 1300, Saktisiriiha must 
have been alive in that year, and if Bhupalasiriiha reigned between 
him and Harisimha—a statement occurring in a seventeenth century 
epigraphic record which we have no good grounds to disbelieve— 
Harisirhha’s accession has to be placed at the end of the first decade 
of the fourteenth century. This appears to be so improbable in 
view of what has been said above, that it seems more reasonable to 
disregard the local traditions and place the accession of Harisiriiha 
about A.D. 1280, possibly even earlier. 18 

There are several references in contemporary literature that 

Harisiriiha defeated the Muslims. “In the Dana-ratnakara Chande- 

• • 

svara is described as having rescued the earth flooded by Mleehchhas.” 
In a two-act comedy, Dhurta-samdgama, which was played in the 
court of Harisiriiha, the King is said to have conquered the Suratrana 
(Sultan). 19 These statements have been taken to refer to Hari- 
siriilia’s fight with Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq in A.D. 1324. But, if, 
as is generally believed, king Harisiriiha was defeated in that fight 
and forced to seek refuge in Nepal, the exulting references to 
victories over the Muslims can hardly apply to that episode. In 
any case, it is equally likely that Harisiriiha scored successes against 
the Muslims either during the last days of the Mamluk Sultans, after 
the death of Balban (A.D. 1287), or during the chaos and confusion 
that followed the death of ‘Ala-ud-din Khaljl (A.D. 1316). There 
is nothing to be surprised at the discomfiture of the Muslim forces, 
probably of a neighbouring locality, when the Delhi Sultanate was 
passing through a grave crisis, and it had a great repercussion on 
the provincial administration. 

Similarly the conquest of Nepal by Chandesvara, mentioned 
above, need not necessarily be referred to a time after the defeat 

398 


MITHILA 


of Harisimha by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq. According to the inter¬ 
pretation of the relevant passage by Monmohan Chakravarti, the 
tula-purusha gift, performed in A.D. 1314, followed upon the 
conquest of Nepal, and this seems to be a very reasonable view. 20 

If we accept the above reconstruction of the history of Hari- 
simha’s reign, we can easily understand why Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq 
directed his efforts towards the subjugation of Tirhut, not attempted 
by any other Sultan of Delhi before him. It is reasonable to infer 
that Mithila had so long escaped Muslim subjugation, mainly because 
it was regarded as an inoffensive petty Hindu State, not unwilling 
to bow down to a strong Sultan. But Harisimha took advantage 
of the temporary weakness of the Muslim rulers to hurl defiance 
at them and even scored some successes. Such occasional resurg¬ 
ence of the Hindu power must have been regarded as a source of 
grave peril to the Muslim domination in India, and the sagacious 
Sultan, Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq, had therefore every reason to regard 
the subjugation of Mithila as a major policy. 

Ghiyas-ud-din’s conquest of Tirhut in A.D. 1324-5 was, how¬ 
ever, hardly regarded as an important episode of his reign. Barani 
simply states, in a general way, that as soon as the Sultan reached 
Tirhut on his way to Bengal, “without the sword being called into 
requisition all the rais and ranas of the country made their sub¬ 
mission”. 21 The episode of Tirhut is altogether omitted in the 
Tdrikh-i-Mubdrak Shdlii, while Nizam-ud-din merely repeats the 
statement of Barani. Tsami is the first historian who gives a detail¬ 
ed account of the Tirhut expedition. After referring to the cap¬ 
ture of Sultan Bahadur of Lakhnawati and the arrival of the captive 
king with his brother Nasir-ud-din at the camp of Sultan Ghiyas- 
ud-din on the bank of the Kosi, Tsami proceeds: 

“Next day the Sultan started from the bank of the Kosi to¬ 
wards Tirhut. He secured two kings at one and the same time, one 
by war, the other by peace. 22 As soon as the king of Tirhut heard 
of the approach of the Sultan he took refuge in a forest. The impe¬ 
rial army reached the outskirts of the forest. The Sultan was very 
much surprised at the sight of the forest. It is said that he himself 
got down from his horse, and taking an axe in his hand cut down 
an old tree in order to clear the jungle. The soldiers, thereupon, 
cleared a passage for the army with the help of axes. In two or 
three days the passage was ready, and on the third day the imperial 
army reached the fort of Tirhut. It had seven deep ditches full of 
water. For two or three weeks the Sultan sent his soldiers to the 
right and the left with orders to attack the Hindus wherever 
gathered, and plunder them. After this he sent (Nasir-ud-din) with 


399 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


royal umbrella to Lakhnawatl. The Sultan left the valiant Ahmad, 
son of Talbaga, in Tirhut and, having started from the camp on the 
next day, reached the capital in one or two months”. 23 

A more detailed account is given by Firishta, who expressly 
says that it is derived from Tsami’s book, Futuh-us-Salatln. Yet he 
described the events following the siege as follows: 

“The King invested the place, filled up the ditches, and des¬ 
troyed the wall in three weeks. The Raja and his family were 
taken, and great booty obtained, while the government of Tirhoot was 
left in the hands of Ahmud Khan, the son of Mulik Tulubigha, after 
which the king returned towards Dehly”. 24 

It will be seen that the two accounts radically differ from 
each other. The earlier account, written by a contemporary, knows 
nothing of the fall of the fort and the capture of the king of Tirhut 
and his family. Moreover, he definitely implies that when the 
Sultan left for Delhi, he could not secure the submission of the king 
of Tirhut and left Ahmad behind to continue the siege. The two 
contemporary historians, Tsami and BaranI, and almost all the later 
writers, excepting Firishta, are silent regarding any success of the 
Muslim arms, not to speak of capturing the fort together with the 
king of Tirhut and his family. Tsami’s book, which alone is ex¬ 
pressly mentioned by Firishta as his source of information, contains 
nothing of the kind. It is legitimate, therefore, to conclude that 
the additional information supplied by Firishta is mostly a later 
concoction prompted by a desire to gloss over the failure of the 
Muslims to subdue a petty Hindu king. 25 

We may, therefore, hold that while the Muslim army overran 
the plains of Tirhut, its brave king Harisimhadeva successfully de¬ 
fended himself in his impregnable citadel in the dense forest of 
Nepal Terai. This not only explains why Muslim historians like 
BaranI, Yahya, and Nizam-ud-dln do not refer to the fight of the 
Sultan with Harisimha, but also the verse in the Dhurta-Samdgama, a 
contemporary two-act comedy played in the court of Harisimha, 
which exultingly refers to the victory of Harisimha and his ministers 
over the Muslim Sultan after a protracted and sanguinary fight. 26 

It may be noted in passing that the citadel, where Harisimha¬ 
deva was besieged by the Muslim forces, can hardly be regarded 
as his capital Simraon, although this is the generally accepted view. 
For no one, whose kingdom mostly extends over the plains, would 
think of fixing his capital city in a dense forest where no army 
could penetrate without cutting down trees on a vast scale. Indeed 
Tsami clearly says that the king of Mithila took refuge in a forest. 


400 


MITHILA, 


Such a statement would be inexplicable if he shut himself up in his 
own capital city. 27 

According to a well-known verse, Harisirhha entered the moun¬ 
tains after leaving his capital city in Saka 1245, on the 9th of 
Pausha, Sudi, Saturday. 28 This has been taken to refer to the flight 
of Harisimha and his conquest of Nepal after his defeat in the hands 
of Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq. But, as such, the date is inadmissible 
for two reasons. In the first place, it corresponds to December 7, 
1323, whereas according to the testimony of Muslim chronicles, 
Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq passed through Tirhut a year later in the 
cold season of A.D 1324. Secondly, 9th Pausha in Saka 1245, whe¬ 
ther we take it as current or expired, was not a Saturday. But 9th 
Pausha in Saka 1247 expired was a Saturday. This date, which 
corresponds to 14th December 1325, seems to be the correct one. 29 
As we have seen above, according to the contemporary Muslim 
chronicler TsamI, Plarisimha was besieged, but not defeated, when 
Ghiyas-ud-din left for Delhi towards the end of A.D. 1324 or the 
beginning of 1325. If we admit, on the authority of the Dhurta-samd- 
gama, that Harisiiiiha offered a stubborn resistance and even inflicted 
defeat upon the imperial army, the date 14th December, 1325, 
may be taken as a more probable date for Harisimha’s entry into 
Nepal after the end of the conflict. As we have seen above, there 
is no evidence that Harisimha fell a prisoner into the hands of the 
Muslims, as Firishta would have us believe. It is more likely that 
he successfully defied the Muslim forces in the impenetrable jungles 
of the Terai. But though Harisimha passed over the crisis, he knew 
full well that he was no match for the Sultan of Delhi, and could 
not resist his might in the plains. So he rightly concluded that he 
could maintain his independence only in the hills and jungles of 
Nepal. It has been assumed by the latest historian of Tirhut that 
Harisimha, after his defeat 4 ‘fled from Tirhut, invaded Nepal and 
settled down there for the rest of his life”. 30 It is very unlikely, 
though not impossible, that a king deserting his people and king¬ 
dom, and fleeing for his life, would be in a position to subdue a 
country like Nepal, whose geographical position and natural de¬ 
fences have enabled it to maintain its independence throughout the 
Muslim and even during the British rule. It is more reasonable 
to suppose that he had already conquered Nepal in the heyday of 
his power and glory, particularly as there are grounds for dating 
this event in or befoe A.D. 1314, as mentioned above. It is also 
not unlikely that the resources of Nepal enabled him to success¬ 
fully resist the Sultan of Delhi in the jungle, when he was forced 
to leave the plains of Tirhut before the invading Muslim army. What 
probably took place in A.D. 1325 was that Harisimha decided 

401 


n s —26 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to abandon his own kingdom and settle in Nepal which acknow¬ 
ledged his suzerainty. The traditional verse, mentioned above, also 
says that he entered (dvivesa or pravesa), not conquered, Nepal. 

However that might be, there is no doubt that after the con¬ 
quest of the plains of Tirhut by the Muslim forces in A.D. 1324-5, 
Harisimhadeva passes out of the history of that country, and hence¬ 
forth he and his family are associated with Nepal rather than Tirhut. 
Their fortunes and achievements in Nepal will be dealt with in 
connection with the history of that country. In the meantime we 
may pursue the history of Tirhut. 

For the time being Tirhut passed under the Delhi Sultanate. 
This is proved by the coins issued by Muhammad bin Tughluq with 
the mint-name Tughluqpur-urf-Tirhut, and the inclusion of Tirhut 
by Ziya-ud-dln Barani in the list of imperial territories paying regu¬ 
lar tribute during the early years of the reign of Muhammad. 31 
But the same writer indicates, though he does not expressly state, 
that Tirhut threw off the Muslim yoke before the end of the reign 
of Muhammad bin Tughluq. Attention may be drawn to the fol¬ 
lowing passage wdiich has not been noticed by the historians, 32 
describing the march of Firuz Tughluq towards Lakhnawatl in 
course of his expedition against Ilyas Shah, in A.D. 1353. 

“When Firuz reached Tirhut, its Hindu king (Ray) and other 
nobles attended his court and offered presents. The Sultan made 
suitable returns. The province of Tirhut now became as obedient 
to the Durbar, and realised Khar a j, as it did before. The Muslim 
soldiers did no harm to Tirhut. For the proper management of the 
State a ruler was appointed according to the rules of succession. 
Many provinces became organised and well administered”. 33 

It would thus appear that the period of anarchy and confusion 
during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq enabled Tirhut to 
assert its independence, but Firuz, on his way to Bengal, restored 
the authority of the Delhi Sultanate. He, however, did not incorpo¬ 
rate it in the Delhi Sultanate but left it under a Hindu King, who, 
in his opinion, had a legitimate claim to the throne. This fits in 
well with the fact that a new Brahmanical dynasty of local kings 
(as distinguished from the Karnataka family) ruled over Tirhut in 
an unbroken line of succession from about A.D. 1353 to about 
A.D. 1526, as will be shown later. But nothing is definitely known 
about the political condition of Tirhut during the quarter of a cen¬ 
tury that elapsed between the conquest of the plains of Tirhut by 
Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq in A.D. 1325 and the establishment of the 
new dynasty by Firuz Tughluq about A.D. 1353. 


402 


MITHILA 


One fact, more or less definitely established, is the invasion 
of Ilyas Shah, Sultan of Bengal. There is hardly any doubt that 
this formed part of the same expedition which led him far into the 
interior of Nepal in A.D. 1349-50. 34 It may be reasonably presumed 
that it was a daring raid for plunder and was not of much political 
importance, 3 3 save perhaps drawing the wrath of Firuz upon this 
ambitious rebel governor of Bengal. In any case this invasion took 
place long after A.D. 1325. 

There are several traditions testifying to the existence of a 
ruling Karnata family in Tirhut even after the departure of Hari¬ 
simha for Nepal in A.D. 1323 or 1325. Vidyapati tells a story in 
which Narasimhadeva of Karnata-Jcwla helped Muhammad, the 
Yavana king of Hastinapura, in his fight with Kafar-raja. The exist¬ 
ence of a ruler of Tirhut, named Nrisimha; is proved by a reference 
in a literary work Dtina-paddhati ; whose author Ramadatta; a cousin 
of Chandesvara, declares himself to be his minister. 3 ' 5 * If this story 
be regarded as true, we may presume that Muhammad bin Tughluq, 
like Firuz Tughluq after him, appointed a scion of the old ruling 
family, to which Harisimha belonged, the ruler of Tirhut under the 
suzerainty of the Sultan of Delhi. It is probably Nrisimhadeva, 
or his successor, who took advantage of the disorder in the empire to 
throw off the yoke of the Sultanate, and hence Firuz selected a Hindu 
ruler of Tirhut from a different family, thereby finally extinguish¬ 
ing the rule of the old Karnata family whose traditions and senti¬ 
ments made them unreliable feudatories. 

Reference is made in the Vamsavaiis of Nepal to Jayatsimha, 
a prince of Tirhut, belonging to the Karnata family, who played a 
leading part in the somewhat chaotic political condition of Nepal 
after A.D. 1330. 36 This also presupposes the existence of a Karnata 
family in Tirhut with real possession of, or pretended claim to, the 
throne. 

It will appear from the history of Nepal, discussed in the next 
section, that while Harisimha and his descendants were ruling as 
suzerains of Nepal, there were local dynasties actually wielding 
sovereign authority in the Nepal valley proper. It is not yet defi¬ 
nitely established, what portion of the kingdom was under the ac¬ 
tual sway of Harisimha’s family. It is not unlikely that .they had 
established themselves in the border-land between Tirhut and 
Nepal, the region where Harisimha resisted the might of the imperial 
Delhi army. 

All these scattered evidences make it likely that the members 
of the Karnata family played some part in the history of Tirhut 
till the arrival there of Firuz Tughluq, on his way to Bengal, in 


403 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


A.D. 1353. As noted above, on the authority of Barani, FIruz set 
up a new king on the throne of Tirhut who readily accepted the 
suzerainty of Delhi. This is supported by traditions of Tirhut which, 
though often vague, contradictory, and confusing, perhaps contain 
a kernel of truth. Reference may here be made only to a few tradi¬ 
tions preserved in the literary works of the famous poet Vidyapati, 
who flourished in the fifteenth century A.D. and graced the courts 
of several kings of Tirhut, including Sivasimha, the most well-known 
of them all. The historial references in Vidyapati’s literary works 
may be summed up as follows: 37 

In A.D. 1326 Harasimha (Harisimha) abandoned the kingdom 
of Tirhut and went into the Nepal jungle. The Emperor of Delhi 
then conferred the kingdom on Kamesvara Thakkura. The names 
of his descendants, so far as is necessary for our present purpose, are 
shown in the following genealogical tree:

FIruz Shah Tughluq deposed Kamesvara and gave the throne to 
his younger son Bhogisvara. He w T as a friend of FIruz, and was 
succeeded by his son Ganesvara. 

Ganesvara was treacherously killed in L.S. 252 (A.D. 1370) by 
Aslan, evidently a Muslim, who wanted to usurp the throne of 
Mithila. But the three sons of Ganesvara, namely Virasimha, Klrtti¬ 
simha, and Rajasimha, with the help of Ibrahim Shah, defeated and 
killed Aslan. As Virasimha also died in this battle, Ibrahim Shah 
made Klrttisimha, his younger brother, the king of Mithila. Else¬ 
where Vidyapati says that Ganesvara had two sons; Klrtti was the 
younger, but went to Delhi, and was given the kingdom by the 
emperor. 

Bhogisvara, on becoming king, had divided the kingdom 
with his brother Bhavasimha. Klrttisimha died childless and so did 
his brother, and the two kingdoms were thus united, after his death, 
under Sivasimha.

MITHILA 


According to the traditional account of Mithila, Kamesvara 
Thakkura founded the famous Sugauna dynasty of Brahmana kings 
who, as we shall see later, ruled in Tirhut till A.D. 1526. The royal 
family is also called Oinavara, from the name of their native village 
Oinl (in Muzaffarpur District). 38 

It would appear from Vidyapati’s account, quoted above, that 
Kamesvara ruled over Tirhut from A.D. 1326 till he was deposed by 
Firuz Tughluq. This is, however, very doubtful. For, elsewhere 
Vidyapati styles him merely as Rajapandita, and some scholars have 
expressed a doubt whether he at all became the king of Mithila 39 . 
It appears, however, from other evidences that he actually ruled over 
Mithila, though only for a very short period, from A.D. 1350 to 1353. 40 

Again, Vidyapati’s reference to the invasion of Tirhut by Aslan 
and his subsequent defeat by Ibrahim 41 cannot be reconciled with 
known facts of history, though desperate attempts have been made by 
several scholars to make it appear historical by amending Vidyapati’s 
text. M. Chakravarti seems to be right in rejecting the passage of 
Vidyapati as corrupt. 42 Again, the statement of Vidyapati that 
Kirttisimha, though a younger son, succeeded his father through the 
intervention of the Emperor of Delhi, cannot be reconciled with the 
other statement about Ibrahim, if we take him as the Sharqi ruler 
of Jaunpur. It is further contradicted by the fact that Vidyapati 
himself gives the title Mahdrdjadhirdja to the elder brother, 
Virasimha. 

As Vidyapati was very nearly a contemporary, we can only ex¬ 
plain away these contradictions and improbabilities by supposing a 
revision and corruption of the text in later times. Similarly the 
traditions recorded in various other books cannot be held as trust¬ 
worthy in all details, as they are often contradictory, and not sup¬ 
ported by any reliable evidence. It is not, therefore, possible to give 
a detailed account of the history of Tirhut during the reign of the 
Sugauna dynasty, and we may discuss it only in broad outline. 

Mention has been made above of the first king Kamesvara, 
the division of the kingdom into two parts after his death, his three 
or four (if we include Virasimha) successors, ruling over one part, and 
the reunion of the kingdom under Sivasimha, son of Devasimha, 
grandson of Bhavasimha (son of Kamesvara), who ruled over the 
other part. 

According to M. Chakravarti, however, there was no division 
of the kingdom and Bhavasimha succeeded Kirttisimha. 43 Others 
reconcile the two by admitting the division, but regarding Bhava¬ 
simha as the successor of Kirttisimha, the grandson of his brother. 44 
In this case, however, the reunion took place in the reign of Bhava-

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


simha, not Sivasimha, as postulated before on the authority of 
Vidyapati. It is unnecessary to describe in detail the reigns of these 
kings, 45 most of which were uneventful or troubled by internal 
dissensions and occasional invasion by the Muslims. But a great 
deal of importance attaches to the status of these kings vis a vis the 
Sultan of Delhi. It seems that they paid nominal allegiance, and 
perhaps even occasional tribute, to the Sultan, when he was strong 
enough to exact them. But under a weak Sultan both were refused, 
and in some cases the king of Tirhut even issued coins in his own 
name. The reign of Sivasiriiha, the greatest ruler of the dynasty, 
offers a striking illustration of the general state of changing political 
conditions after the disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate at the begin¬ 
ning of the fifteenth century A.D. Tirhut was now hemmed in between 
the two independent Muslim kingdoms of Bengal and Jaunpur. The 
Sharqi ruler of Jaunpur occasionally imposed his authority, taking, 
as usual, full advantage of disputed successions in which one party 
appealed to him for aid. In the concluding verse of the Purusha - 
parlksha, Vidyapati says that Sivasimha gained glory in a terrible bat¬ 
tle with the king of Gauda and with (him of) Gajjana. 46 The former 
undoubtedly refers to Bengal, and the latter, probably to Jaunpur. It 
is impossible to recover historical truth from the mass of legends re¬ 
corded by the famous contemporary poet Vidyapati, and his vague, 
general statements about the decisive victory of Sivasimha over the 
Muslims cannot be taken at their face value. An important evidence 
of Sivasimha’s general success and freedom from the Muslim yoke is 
furnished by the gold coins issued by him 47 

According to a tradition recorded by Mulla Taqyya, a courtier 
of Akbar and Jahangir, Ibrahim Sharqi, the Sultan of Jampur, 
while proceeding against Bengal to chastise Raja Ganesa 473 , was 
opposed by “Sheo Singh, the Zamindar of Tirhut who had rebelled 
against his father, Raja Deva Singh made an alliance with Raja 
Ganesa, and thus became an independent ruler of Tirhut.” Sheo 
Singh was defeated and taken prisoner and “the whole territory of 
Tirhut was again transferred to his father as a loyal servant of the 
Sultan”. Mulla Taqyya gives the date of this event as 805 ATI. 
(1402-3 A.D.). The date is obviously wrong as Ganesa came to 
power much later (about 1417 A.D.). It is, however, more likely 
that the Muslim ruler against whom Sivasimha fought was the Sharqi 
ruler of Jaunpur rather than the Sultan of Delhi. There may be 
some truth in Taqyya’s statement that Sivasimha was an inde¬ 
pendent ruler who felt powerful enough to challenge the Sultan of 
Jaunpur, as it tallies with the account given above. But his alliance 
with Raja Ganesa, rebellion against his father, and defeat and 
imprisonment by Ibrahim Sharqi, as alleged by Mulla Taqyya are 


406 


MITHILA 


not supported by any other evidence. As the date of Ibrahim’s 
invasion of Bengal, given by him is wrong, it is evident that Taqyya 
had no authentic account before him but relied mostly on current 
traditions. 4713 

Taqyya quoted an inscription on a mosque at Darbhanga 
recording its construction by the orders of Sultan Ibrahim 
in 805 A.H. (1402-3 A.D.). Probably this was done when Ibra¬ 
him came to Tirhut to punish the usurper Aslan as mentioned 
above. Taqyya might have been misled by this inscription not only 
to refer the later expedition of Ibrahim against Ganesa to this date 
but also to drag in the name of Sivasimha in that connection. 

Sivasimha’s copper-plate grant in favour of Vidyapati is drawn 
up in the grandiloquent style of the old Hindu Emperors, and is 
dated in La Sam 293, Sana 807, Samvat 1455, &aka 1321. 48 The 
mention of four different eras is unusual, but the existence of the 
Sana-era at that time may be doubted, as it appears to have been 
introduced by Akbar by the conversion of the lunar Hijra year to 
a solar one. On these grounds the grant has been regarded as 
spurious by some. 49 

The only authentic date of Sivasimha seems to be La Sam 291, 
known from a colophon of a manuscript. 50 If interpreted in the 
usual manner by taking A.D. 1119 as the epoch of the La Sam, it 
would be equivalent to A.D. 1410, but many instances are known 
where La Sam was counted with the initial year varying between 
A.D. 1107 and 1120. 51 

According to Vidyapati, Yavana forces attacked Sivasimha 57 
who, after his fight with the Muslims, became independent king of 
Tirhut in L. S. 293 or Saka 1324 (A.D. 1402). 53 His father Deva- 
sirhha had left the family residence of OinI and founded the city 
of Sivasimhapura, also known as Gajarathapura. When Sivasimha 
had been three years and nine months on the throne after his father’s 
death, he was conquered by the Musulmans and carried to Delhi. 
His wife, Lakhima, with Vidyapati, took refuge in Banaull which is 
close to Janakapura in Nepal. When no news of Sivasimha had. 
been received from Delhi for twelve years, Lakhima became sat! 54 
and Padmasimha, Sivasimha’s younger brother, came to the throne; 
but he reigned only for a year. He was succeeded by his widow 
Visvasa Devi, who reigned for twelve years. 

The genuineness of this passage may be doubted. As a matter 
of fact, different views are current regarding the order of succession 
after the death of Sivasimha. According to some, he was succeeded 
by his brother Padmasimha, after whom the sovereignty passed to 
Harasimha, a member of a junior branch of the family. 55 According 


407 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to others, Lakhima, the chief queen of Sivasimha, and Visvasa Devi, 
queen of Padmasimha, ascended the throne after the death of their 
husbands. 56 

Dhlrasimha, the grandson of Harasimha, is described as a great 
warrior and world-famous conqueror by Vidyapati in the opening 
lines of the Durgabhakti-tarangim , and his brother is credited with 
the subjugation of the lord of Pahcha-Gauda (Bengal). 57 One of 
his known dates is La Sam 321, which falls between A.D. 1428 and 
1441. 58 The Sultanates of Delhi, Bengal, and Jaunpur, as mentioned 
above, were then passing through evil days, being convulsed by 
internal dissensions and foreign wars. It is not unlikely, therefore, 
that Dhlrasimha took advantage of them to assert his independence 
and carry on raids against his neighbours. Bhairavendra or Bhairava- 
simha, the younger brother of Dhlrasimha, succeeded him. He had 
defeated the Lord of Pahcha-Gauda during his brother’s reign, and is 
said to have influenced Kedara Raya, the representative of the Lord 
of Gauda (Bengal). 59 He had the epithet Harinarayana and was the 
patron of Vachaspati Misra. Ramachandra, the son and successor of 
Bhairavendra, had the epithet Rupanarayana and ruled about A.D. 
1490. He is said to have met Sikandar Lodi as a friend and conquered 
Gauda. 60 The next king, Lakshmmathadeva Kamsanarayana, two of 
whose known dates are A.D. 1510 and 1513, is described as a great 
“warrior king” and the “king of kings”. It is evident that for nearly 
three quarters of a century kings of Tirhut were playing an important 
role in East Indian politics in the confused political situation of the 
country, and fought with the neighbouring rulers of Jaunpur and 
Bengal. After Jaunpur was annexed to the Delhi Sultanate and 
Sikandar Lodi advanced through Bihar in pursuit of Husain Sharql, 
he turned his attention to Tirhut (A.D. 1494-5). The ruler of Tirhut 
submitted peacefully and offered some lakhs of tankas as tribute and 
present. 61 Next year Sikandar Lodi concluded peace with Sultan 
Husain Shah of Bengal on the basis of status quo . Shortly after¬ 
wards Husain conquered Saran, as is proved by his inscription at 
that place dated A.D. 1503-4. 62 But as Saran lay outside Tirhut, and 
the Muslim invaders, as mentioned above, usually avoided Tirhut 
while proceeding towards Awadh and Delhi, the inscription does 
not prove the conquest of the whole of Tirhut by Husain Shah of 
Bengal, 63 particularly as Lakshmlnatha is known to have been ruling 
in A.D. 1510 or 1513. This view is further supported by the fact 
that Husain’s son and successor Nusrat Shah (A.D. 1519-32) sent a 
military expedition against Tirhut which subjugated the province. 
That the victory was complete is proved by the fact that Nusrat 
annexed Tirhut and appointed his two brothers-in-law to govern the 
province. According to literary evidence Lakshmlnatha died in 


408 


MITHILA 


A.D. 1526 With him the Hindu State of Mithila or Tirhut was 
finally extinguished. There were altogether about 15 rulers in the 
Sugauna dynasty who ruled from c. A.D. 1353 to 1526. 

During this period another family of kings ruled in the terri¬ 
tory, south of Nepal, on both sides of the Gandak, roughly corres¬ 
ponding to Gorakhpur and Champaran Districts. Two kings of 
this dynasty are mentioned in the colophons of manuscripts, namely 
Prithvisirhhadeva (A.D. 1434-35) and Madanasimhadeva, for whom 
we have got two dates, V. S. 1511 (A.D. 1453-54) and La Sam 339 
(A.D. 1446 to 1459). He was the author of the Madana-ratnapradipa. 
He is referred to as king Madanasimhadeva, son of king Saktisimha, 
and adorned by many birudas. One of these is Vipravdja which 
shows that he was a Brahmana. Another is Daityanarayana, which 
links him with the kings of the Oinavara line many of whom assumed 
titles ending in Narayana. It also shows that the king was of 
Vaishnava faith. This makes it probable that it was he who issued 
the series of coins, found in the region over which he ruled and bear¬ 
ing the legend “ Govmda-charana-pranava-madana” on the obverse 
and c Sri-Champakdranya’ on the reverse. On general grounds also 
these coins are to be referred to the 15th century A.D., and indicate 
the existence of a Hindu kingdom in the Champaran District. The 
three kings Prithvisirhha, Saktisimha and Madanasimha may be 
presumed to be its rulers. 64 

It has been suggested that these kings represent a branch of the 
Oinavara family which established a separate kingdom after the death 
of Sivasimha. 65 Curiously enough, the traditions and legends of 
Mithila, which refer to all sorts of possible and impossible historical 
events, are quite silent about them. 

S. Levi has suggested that these kings belonged to the family of 
Harisimha, evidently on the similarity of names of two kings, 
Madanasimha and Saktisimha, presumably successors of Harisimha, 
who, according to Chinese chronicles, ruled in Nepal respectively in 
A.D. 1387 and 1413. 66 The epithet bipra or Brahmana, however, 
goes against this view. 

Casual references are made to other kings in the same region. 
Thus an inscription of A.D. 1500, engraved on the Lauriya Nandan- 
garh Pillar of Asoka, mentions “ Nripa-Nardyana-suta-nripa Amara- 
simha”. 61 Whether Amarasimha, son of king Narayana, was a ruling 
chief of this region and, if so, whether he belonged to the dynasty of 
Champaran mentioned above,—all these and cognate questions cannot 
be answered at present. But it is not unlikely that there were many 
powerful feudatory chiefs in this region who occasionally declared 
independence whenever a suitable opportunity presented itself. 


409 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The survival of the small state of Tirhut, a tiny Hindu island in 
the Muslim ocean, must be regarded as an event of the highest im¬ 
portance from the point of view of medieval Hindu culture. As has 
been very rightly pointed out, “it gave refuge to a number of Pandits 
and students flying from the flames of foreign invasions that burnt 
up the neighbouring centres of learning”. 68 Sanskrit learning 
flourished under the patronage of the Hindu rulers in Mithila, such as 
it did nowhere else in Northern India during the seven hundred 
years that followed the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. 
Mithila School was not only instrumental in preserving the old 
Sanskrit works and traditions dealing particularly with laws and 
usages, but also contributed a great deal that was new, specially in 
the branch of Nyaya. A detailed account of all this will be given in 
the chapter on Literature. It will suffice here to state that during 
the period under review Mithila produced famous scholars like 
Chandesvara Thakkura and Vachaspati Misra, whose names are even 
now remembered all over India. Thus the contribution of the small 
State of Tirhut or Mithila to the preservation and development of 
Hindu culture, during the medieval age, exceeds far in importance, 
and gives a special value to, the annals of its political history. 

III. NEPAL 

According to tradition of Nepal, King Nanyadeva’s descendants, 
right up to Harisimha, ruled over Nepal in an unbroken line of succes¬ 
sion during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A.D. But, as men¬ 
tioned above, this is hard to reconcile with the fact that throughout 
the same period the Vamsavdtis of Nepal refer to indigenous kings 
ruling in unbroken succession. 1 The only possible explanation seems 
to be that the descendants of Nanya were really rulers of Tirhut, 
but maintained a sort of suzerainty over Nepal, the nature of which 
probably varied from time to time and cannot be precisely defined. 2 
The conquest of Nepal by Harisimha, to which reference has been 
made above, 3 may be regarded as a practical assertion of the 
suzerainty rather than a fresh conquest. 

This is supported by a local tradition to the effect that the 
chiefs and peoples of Bhatgaon welcomed Harisimha to the palace 
without any resistance. This is attributed to the power of the 
goddess Tulaja, the patron deity of Harisimhadeva. 4 But a less 
mysterious explanation may be found in the long-standing claim of 
suzerainty on the part of the king of Mithila. That the occupation 
of Nepal was not effected without some fight, appears clearly from 
the boast of Chandesvara that he was “victorious over all the kings 
of Nepal”. 


410 


NEPAL 


Levi drawn attention to the slight differences in the word¬ 
ings of this boast in two different works of Chandesvara. In the 
Kritya-ratndkara Chandesvara is an aggressive conqueror of Nepal. 
In the Kritya-chintamani, he is the heroic defender. 5 If the change 
is a deliberate one 5 the first may refer to the original conquest, and 
the second to the defence of the kingdom against the Muslims. 
No actual invasion of Nepal by any Muslim force at this period is 
recorded, but it is interesting to refer in this connection to a single 
coin bearing the name of ‘Ala-ud-din Khalji which was probably 
minted in Nepal. It has been inferred from this coin that the ruler 
of Nepal acknowledged the suzerainty of ‘Ala-ud-din, but this is very 
problematical. 54 

Not much is known about Harisimha’s rule in Nepal. The un¬ 
settled nature of the time is indicated by the invasion of Nepal, 
in A.D. 1328, by Adityamalla, the king of the Khasiyas of Western 
Nepal. 6 It is suggested by Levi that Harisirhha had probably by 
this time gone back to Tirhut where local dynasties, originating from 
him, ruled prosperously for a long time. 7 But, as we have seen 
above, 8 the Thakurs who ruled in Tirhut from about A.D. 1353 to 
1526, to whom Levi obviously refers, belonged to a local Brahmana 
family and do not claim any connection with the Karnata family to 
which Harisimha belonged. 

As a matter of fact the fate of Harisimha’s family after he set¬ 
tled in Nepal is a moot point to decide. Harisimha is mentioned 
in almost all the Vamsdvalts as the king of Nepal and is said to have 
ruled for 28 years. But there is no unanimity in the Vamsavalis of 
Nepal about his successors. Later chronicles mention three kings, 
as successors of Harisimha, and legitimate rulers of Nepal. 
These are: 9 

1. Matisirhha—15 years. 

2. Saktisimha—22 (27 or 33) years. 

3. :§yamasimha—15 years. 

All these are recognized as SuryavamsI kings of Bhatgaon. The 
official genealogy, as given in the epigraphic records of the Malla 
kings during the seventeenth century, however, completely ignores 
the above three kings, and none of them is referred to in any manu¬ 
script of Nepal. 

The later chronicles, however, not only give the names of these 
three kings, but also describe some incidents of each reign. The 
most interesting of these is the mention of diplomatic relations bet¬ 
ween them and the Emperor of China. For this enables us to check 
the veracity of these chronicles. The Chinese texts, according to 
Levi, leave no doubt that the Chinese Emperors sent embassies 


411 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to, and received embassies from, the successors of Harisimha men¬ 
tioned above, with slight variations in names, due, perhaps, to the 
error, either of the Nepalese or of the Chinese scribes. 9a It is thus 
definitely proved that at least during the period of diplomatic inter¬ 
course, namely between A.D. 1387 and 1418, the Chinese knew of no 
other kings in Nepal except the descendants of Harisimha. 

Nevertheless the Nepalese V arks avails have preserved a conti¬ 
nuous list of indigenous kings, many of whom must have been con¬ 
temporaries, ruling over petty States in addition to those of Patan 
and Bhatgoan. It is possible here to refer to a few leading rulers 
only. As mentioned above, 10 Jayarudramalla died in A.D. 1326, 
and this roughly coincides with the date of Harisimha’s conquest. 
Almost all the Vamsdvalis agree that Harisimha ruled over Nepal, 
but the political history after his death is given differently. Accord¬ 
ing to the later chronicles, after the reigns of Harisimha and his 
three successors mentioned above, Jayabhadramalia, the son-in-law 
of the last king Syamasimha, ascended the throne. He was followed 
by five kings, whose names end in Maila, the last one being Asoka- 
malla. The names of none of these are known from other sources. 11 

Some Vamsdvalis and the Introduction of Mudita-Kuvalaydsva 
mention Valliarasimha as the successor of Harisimha. Then follow 
three Maila kings ending in Asokamalla. 12 

In both cases Asokamalla was succeeded by Jayasthitimalla, 
with whose reign the history of Nepal again enters upon a firm 
ground which is never lost. 

Much important information regarding the period is supplied 
by a semi-Sanskrit Vamsdvali, discovered by Bendall in 1899, 13 com¬ 
posed towards the end of the fourteenth century A.D. It makes no 
mention of the invasion of Harisimha, and continues, without any 
break, the history of the indigenous Malta kings after Jayarudra¬ 
malla, who died in A.D. 1326. 14 The infant son of Jayarudra died 
a few days after his father’s death, and Nayakadevi, the daughter 
of Jayarudra, was married (after being crowned Rani according to 
another Vamsdvali) to Harichandra belonging to the royal family 
of . Banaras. Harichandra was poisoned, after some years, in 
A.D. 1335, and thereafter his brother Gopaladeva, accompanied by 
Jagatsimhadeva, described as belonging to Karnata family and a 
native of Tirhut, seized the person of Nayakadevi. The allies, who 
appear to have taken Bhatgoan and Patan, however, fell out and 
Gopala was beheaded by the followers of Jagatsimha (A.D. 1341). 
Jagatsimha seized the kingdom and married Nayakadevi, but was put 
into confinement, it is not mentioned by whom, after only a few 
days. Nayakadevi also died, ten days after giving birth to a daughter,

NEPAL 


RajalladevI (A.D. 1347). Mention is made of Pasupatimalladeva, 
but his connection with the above persons or incidents is not stated. 
Possibly he represented a rival line of kings and had some share 
in the imprisonment of Jagatsirhha, 15 for it is said, immediately 
after, that “by the consent of both royal families Jayarajadeva was 
made king in 467” (A.D. 1347, about five months before the birth 
of RajalladevI), and this “was subsequently ratified by general con¬ 
sent”. The two royal families were probably the Simhas and the 
Mallas. 16 Jayaraja, who was born in A.D. 1317, was the son of 
Jayananda, the successor of Anantamalla (A.D. 1279-1307) as men¬ 
tioned above, 17 and was succeeded by his son Jayarjuna. In the 
meantime RajalladevI had been married to Jayasthitimalla who 
eventually dethroned Jayarjuna and became ruler of Nepal. 

The historicity of Jayarajadeva is proved by both literary 
and epigraphic evidence. Manuscripts were copied during his reign 
in A.D. 1353-4, 1356, and 1361. 18 Far more important are two 
inscriptions, one dated A.D. 1357, at Patan, and the second, dated 
A.D. 1372, in the shrine of Svayambhunatha, about six miles from 
the temple of Fasupati at Kathmandu. 19 Both of these refer to 
the depredations, particularly burning and pillage of temples, 
caused by the invasion of Shams-ud-dln Ilyas Shah of Bengal. The 
second inscription specifically states that the invasion took place dur¬ 
ing the reign of Jayaraja in the year 470 20 of the Nepal era (=A.D. 
1350). The Varh&avali discovered by Bendall, mentioned above, 
also refers to this Muslim invasion during the reign of Jayaraja. 
It states that Jayaraja was forced, in A.D. 1348 and again in 1349, 
to draw upon the treasury of the Lord Fasupati. In 1349, 
“Samasadina, the Suratriana of the East, came to Nepal, broke Pasu- 
pati into three pieces and burnt the whole of Nepal”. 21 

The second inscription, 22 referred to above, clears up the 
mystery and obscurity that hitherto surrounded the history of Nepal 
at this period. It tells us that some time after the invasion of Ilyas 
Jayaraja died, being burnt in his house while asleep. He was suc¬ 
ceeded by his son Jayarjuna. At that time Jayasthitimalla was 
protecting the famous town of Kashthamandapa (Kathmandu). Men¬ 
tion is then made of Rajaharshamalla and his two brothers, who 
distinguished themselves by defeating the enemies. Rajaharsha¬ 
malla, with the consent of the two kings, like Indra and Upendra, 
rebuilt and decorated the Dharmadhatu stupa in the year 492 
(=A.D. 1371-2). 

It would thus appear that the internal dissensions were merely 
patched up for a time by the accession of Jayaraja, but the seeds 
of disunion were not rooted out altogether. A rival, Jayasthitimalla, 


413 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


established himself at Kathmandu, and whatever might have been 
his original status, there is hardly any doubt that by A.D. 1371-2 
he was practically recognized as an independent ruler. He is not 
only referred to as the moon of the Kshatriya ocean, but it is ex¬ 
pressly said that Raj aharshamalla had to take permission from the 
two kings, an expression which could only imply that like Jayar- 
juna, Jayasthitimalla also enjoyed sovereign status, at least de facto, 
if not de jure. It is only a short step from this position to the 
sovereignty of the whole of Nepal. The political situation in Nepal 
after the ruthless invasion of Ilyas Shah must have helped a strong 
adventurer to secure the throne. For, though the Muslim invasion 
was nothing but a raid, it destroyed the prestige of the ruling family 
and created a state of disorder where one could easily fish in 
troubled waters. Jayasthitimalla evidently based his claim to the 
throne upon the Karnata origin of his wife’s father Jagatsimha. But 
to increase this glory still further, Jayasthitimalla and his descend¬ 
ants traced their descent through the male line direct from Hari- 
siriiha, and the whole genealogy was transformed to substantiate 
this claim. 

Jayarjunamalla, who came to the throne after the Muslim in¬ 
vasion in A.D. 1349-50, is known from colophons of manuscripts to 
have been ruling from A.D. 1361 to 1382. He died in A.D. 1382, when 
Jayasthitimalla became the sole ruler. 23 According to the Vamsci- 
valis, he ruled for 43 years, and must have died at the end of 
A.D. 1395 or at the beginning of 1396. 24 

These dates, authenticated by unimpeachable evidence of 
manuscripts and inscriptions, raise an interesting problem. As we 
have seen above, there was diplomatic intercourse between China 
and Nepal between A.D. 1387 and 1418, and during this period the 
Chinese do not know of Jayasthitimalla and his successors, but 
only the descendants of Harisimha, mentioned above, as rulers of 
Nepal. 

There is a reference to a ruler named Jayasimha Rama in a 
manuscript copied in A.D. 1395-6, and in another document, thirty 
years earlier, along with Jayarjuna. There is also a casual mention 
of a person of the same name accompanying Jayasthitimalla in the 
procession of Matsyendranatha in A.D. 1387. 2,5 The royal name 
ending in ‘simha’ naturally recalls to memory the Karnata family 
of Harisimha, and indirectly corroborates the Chinese evidence that 
this family was not extinct in Nepal even at the beginning of the 
fifteenth century A.D. Perhaps, as Levi suggests, 26 the kings of his 
family lived at Bhatgaon as nominal suzerains, while the indigen¬ 
ous rulers, mentioned above, reigned at the other two capitals, 


414 


NEPAL 


Patan and Kathmandu, as their nominal vassals. In any case the 
Chinese evidence hardly leaves any doubt that, side by side with 
the indigenous rulers of Nepal, the kings of Karnata family, descend¬ 
ed from Harisimha, exercised an effective power somewhere in 
the Nepal valley and were recognized as the rulers of Nepal by the 
imperial court of China. 

Jayasthitimalla was a capable ruler. He restored the unity 
and prosperity of Nepal by thoroughly curbing the power of the 
feudal chiefs whose mutual dissensions had brought ruin upon Nepal 
by dividing it into two or more autonomous States. He was a 
patron of literature and introduced many social and economic re¬ 
forms. Among others, he fixed, by rule, the status of the different 
castes and classes, and made regulations about measures and weights. 
He assumed the titles Dayitanarayana and Asuranarayana. 27 

Jayasthitimalla had three sons who at first ruled conjointly 
after their father’s death, as is proved by colophons dated A.D. 1398 
and 1400. But in A.D. 1411 the manuscript of Siddhi-sdra, comsposed 
by the youngest, Jayajyotirmalla, gives his name alone, with impe¬ 
rial titles. An official inscription, dated A.D. 1413, shows that he 
was then the sole emperor. He ruled at least up to A.D. 1426-7. 
The assumption of imperial titles probably marks his virtual de¬ 
fiance of the imperial authority of Harisimha’s family. Jayajyotir¬ 
malla was a contemporary of Saktisimha of this family who, accord¬ 
ing to the Chinese chronicles, ruled between A.D. 1413 and 1418. 
These Chinese chronicles state that when the Chinese Emperor 
tried to renew the friendly intercourse in 1427 he got no response. 28 
This shows that some time between A.D. 1418 and 1427 Jayajyotir¬ 
malla, who had already assumed imperial titles, finally extinguished 
even the nominal pretensions of the Karnata family of Harisimha. It 
is to be noted that Saktisimha sent his presents to the Chinese Em¬ 
peror from Palamchok, to the east of Nepal valley proper. 29 Pre¬ 
sumably he had to leave Nepal before A.D. 1418. 

Jayajyotirmalla was succeeded by his son Jayayakshamalla, 
whose known dates range over more than half a century, between 
A.D. 1427 and 1479. The Nepalese chronicles refer to his victories 
all round, extending as far as Mithila, Magadha, Vanga and Tibet. 
These are no doubt hyperboles, but there may be some truth in the 
claim that he defeated the Gurkha chiefs and established his autho¬ 
rity over the whole of Nepal by subjugating the hill tribes and sub¬ 
duing the rebellious nobles of Patan and Kathmandu. 30 

Before his death (about A.D. 1480), he divided his kingdom 
among his three sons and one daughter, thus creating the four 
independent States of Bhatgaon, Banepa, Kathmandu and Patan. 


415 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Patan was shortly afterwards united to Kathmandu, and thus, to¬ 
wards the end of the period under review, Nepal was divided into 
three independent States, all ruled by the members of the same 
family, whose quarrels and dissensions paved the way for the Gur¬ 
kha conquest in A.D. 1768. 

E. MALABAR AND TP1E PORTUGUESE 

I. MALABAR 

The whole of the western coast of India, from Goa to Quilon, 
was outside the Tughluq Empire, and consisted of a number of small 
principalities, mostly Hindu. Ibn Batutah gives a short account of 
some of these States which he visited on his way to China in 
A.D. 1343-4. 1 

Ibn Batutah boarded a sailing vessel at Gandhar near the mouth 
of the Narmada, and after passing through a few harbours reached 
Sandapur, modern Goa. It was an island, surrounded by a creek, 
in the midst of wdiich were thirty-six villages and two cities, namely, 
the old one, built by the old Hindu rulers, and a new city built by 
the Muslims, when they first conquered it (pp. 176-7). 

Passing through a small island, probably Anjidiv, Ibn Batutah 
reached Hinawr (probably modern Honavar) inhabited by Muslims 
who were “powerful at sea” and “earned their living by maritime 
trade”. The ruler was a Muslim, Jamal-ud-dln Muhammad, but he 
acknowledged the suzerainty of a Hindu, probably the Hoysala 
king (pp. 179-80). 

Though Ibn Batutah speaks in a general way of the coast of 
Malabar—the pepper country—as extending from Goa to Quilon, it 
appears from his detailed description that Malabar proper was 
reached three days after he left Hinawr. 

Ibn Batutah found twelve Hindu States in Malabar. Some of 
them were very powerful, possessing an army of fifty thousand men, 
while others were very weak, and could not muster more than three 
thousand. Yet they lived in peace and amity. That the rulers were 
all Nairs follows from the statement that “the rulers in this land 
bequeath their sovereignty to the sons of their sisters and exclude 
their own children” (p. 183). 

Although the rulers were Hindu, there was a strong Muslim 
community in each State. Though they usually lived apart, they 
received very fair and liberal treatment and enjoyed perfect free¬ 
dom of worship which the Muslim rulers denied to the Hindus. In 
Fakanar (a place in South Canara) the thirty war-ships of the Raja 
were in charge of a Muslim commander. The ruler of Jurfattan, 


416 


MALABAR 


which has been identified with Cannanore, possessed many ships 
which went to Oman, Fars, and Yemen (p. 186). 

After a brief halt at Calicut, to which reference will be made 
later, Ibn Batutah proceeded by way of river to Quilon. On his 
way he passed through a Jewish settlement at Kunjakari living 
under a Jewish chief, but paying tax to the Hindu ruler of Quilon. 2 
This Hindu Raja held the Muslims in high regard, and they had a 
prosperous settlement under their own chief and judge, both of 
whom hailed from Persia (p. 193). 

II. CALICUT 

The most powerful chief in Malabar, during the 14th and 15th 
centuries, was the ruler of Calicut, called Zamorin. Reference has 
been made above 3 to the rule of the Perumals in Kerala and the 
last king of this dynasty, Cheraman Perumal. Various stories are 
current about his pilgrimage, after abdication and conversion to 
either Christianity or Islam. These traditions have little historical 
value, and were evidently circulated to explain the growth of Mus¬ 
lim and Christian settlements in Malabar about this time. 4 

The date of Cheraman Perumal is not definitely known, but 
most probably he flourished between A.D. 750 and 825. The end 
of the rule of the Perumals gave rise to a number of small princi¬ 
palities in Malabar, the most important of which was Calicut. Many 
traditions are current, tracing the line of the rulers of Calicut, 
called Zamorin, in an unbroken line of succession from Manavikra- 
man, the son of Cheraman Perumal and a Nair girl belonging to 
the family of the Eradis of Nediyiruppu. It is said that as this son 
could not succeed his father under the matriarchal system prevalent 
among the Nairs, Cheraman Perumal, at the time of his abdication, 
gave him, “as a special mark of regard and affection his sword and 
the small strip of territory on the coast which later on became the 
port of Calicut”. 6 

Whatever we might think of this story or of the traditional 
account of the kingdom in subsequent times, there is no doubt that 
it was the most powerful kingdom and the chief centre of trade 
in'Malabar as early as the beginning of the fourteenth century A.D. 

The riches derived from trade enabled the Zamorin to extend 
his authority along the Malabar coast from Cannanore to Cochin. 
The Hindu ruler of Cochin traced his descent from the Surya- 
Kshatriya clan to whom Cheraman Perumal is said to have given 
the country round Cochin when he divided his empire. In course 
of time the kingdom was split up among five branches of the dynasty, 
who formed a sort of federation, the oldest male member among 

417 


D.S.— 2 ? 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


all the branches taken together having the right to succeed to the 
nominal headship. This naturally gave rise to internal dissensions, 
full advantage of which was taken by the Zamorin of Calicut. By 
offering his help to one of the rival parties, he could easily estab¬ 
lish his political influence in Cochin, and in this way he conquered 
a large part of the region round Cochin and reduced the Raja to 
a state of vassalage. 6 According to the historical chronicles of 
Kerala, “the Cochin Raja paid an annual tribute to his suzerain 
(Zamorin), obtained his overlord’s recognition before his accession, 
sent contingents to the Zamorin’s army, and refrained from strik¬ 
ing coins and roofing his palace with tiles. He had to send all his 
pepper to Calicut, and the Christians were deprived of the right of 
navigation which was transferred to the Moors”. 7 This is partly 
corroborated by the Portuguese accounts 8 according to which the 
kingdom of Cochin, like Cannanore, was subject to the Zamorin, 
who often drove the king of Cochin out of his kingdom and restored 
him at his pleasure. The king of Cochin, we are further told, gave 
him every year a certain number of elephants and could not strike 
coins nor roof his palace with tiles. 

Ibn Batutah, who visited the city of Calicut no less than six 
times, and stayed there for nearly three months on his first visit, 
has left an account of its commercial importance. It was “one of 
the chief harbours of the country of Malabar, where people from 
China, Sumatra ( Jawa ), Ceylon (Saylcm ), the Maidive islands 
(Mahal), Yemen and Fars come, and here gather merchants from all 
quarters of the globe. And the harbour of Calicut is one of the 
largest in the world”. 9 The trade and commerce were in the hands 
of Muslims, mostly traders from Arabian ports. Ibrahim, a mer¬ 
chant from Bahrein, was the head of the merchants in this town 
and held the office of ‘Shah Bandar’ or ‘receiver-general of duties’. 
He was the chief officer in the customs house with whom foreign 
merchants and captains negotiated. The judge of Calicut was also 
a Muslim. Another Muslim, the ship-master Misqal, “possessed 
great riches and many ships for trading purposes in India, China, 
Yemen and Fars”. 10 

Thus, although the ruler was Hindu, the Muslims strongly 
dominated not only the commerce but also the politics of the king¬ 
dom of Calicut. The king gave absolute freedom of worship to the 
Muslims, though he forbade the slaughter of cows and the eating of 
beef. 11 The religious toleration, the good administration which 
guaranteed security and impartiality of treatment to all, and, above 
all, the friendly attitude of Zamorin to all foreign traders, were some 
of the causes that made Calicut the chief centre of trade in Malabar. 


418 


THE PORTUGUESE 


But these very virtues of the Zamorin proved his undoing on the 
advent of the Portuguese. 

III. the western trade 

In order to view the history of the Portuguese in India in its 
true perspective, it is necessary to make a few preliminary obser¬ 
vations about the maritime trade of India. Economic factors have 
often profoundly influenced the course of history, and sometimes 
even revolutionized it. The foreign trade and maritime activities 
of India, during the period under review, suddenly changed the 
course of history, not only of India but of the whole civilized world. 

Reference has been made in the preceding volumes to the mari¬ 
time trade carried on by the Indians since remote antiquity, both 
in the eastern and in the western seas. The rise of the Arabs as a 
great maritime power in tjie ninth century A.D. was the first direct 
challenge to the supremacy of the Indians in the Western Sea. An 
authentic account of the rivalry between the two maritime powers 
is not available. But the position in the fifteenth century A. D. 
may be summed up as follows: 12 

1. Indian owned ships, from Gujarat, Malabar, and various 
ports on the eastern coast, brought spices and other costly goods 
from Malacca, “then practically the sole entrepot for China and the 
Spice Islands”. On the west, Indian ships carried on trade with 
Hormuz in the Persian Gulf and various ports on the coast of East 
Africa, and pilgrim traffic to the Red Sea. The main centre of this 
trade was Gujarat, but Malabar and Konkan had also a large share 
in it in the fourteenth century A. D., as is proved by the detailed 
statement of Ibn Batutah. 13 A few junks from China still reached 
India, 14 but most of them stopped at Malacca. The junks of China 
were strongly built, 15 the timber being fastened by iron nails. The 
ships owned by Indians and Arabs (including Egyptians) were built 
mainly, if not exclusively, in India, but they were very frail as their 
heavy planks were made fast with cocoanut cordage and wooden 
pins. 

2. The Arabs exercised a strict monopoly in the trade from 
Malabar to the Red Sea. The eastern goods brought by Indian ships 
to Malabar ports, together with the Indian pepper and cinnamon 
from Ceylon, were carried in Arab ships to Jidda and Ormuz. They 
also shared with Indian ships the carrying trade between Gujarat 
on the one hand and Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and East Africa on the 
other. From Ormuz Indian wares found their way in smaller boats, 
more suited to the navigation, to Basra, where the trade routes 
divided; some caravans started for Trebizond, and others for Aleppo 


419 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


and Damascus. On the shores of the Mediterranean the goods were 
purchased by Venetians and Genoese for distribution over Europe. 
Jidda played the same role in the Red Sea as Ormuz in the Persian 
Gulf. To the north of Jidda navigation was hampered by reefs and 
shoals, and so goods were transferred to smaller boats that went to 
Suez* From Suez the merchandize crossed the desert to Cairo on 
camels, and thence went down the Nile to Alexandria. 16 

The most important consequence of this state of things was 
that the Arabs were almost the sole purveyors of the eastern spices 
which were much prized in Europe. They controlled the entire 
trade between India and Europe except the small volume that 
passed over land route, either from the north-west of India or from 

the head of the Persian Gulf. 

■ 

But the Arabs were also mere intermediaries. The goods 
carried by them to the Mediterranean ports were taken over by the 
Italian merchants, mainly from Genoa and Venice, who distributed 
them throughout Europe. 

The cost of transmitting wares from India to Europe was very 
heavy, due to the large number of transhipments and high duties 
imposed by the various authorities through whose jurisdictions they 
had to pass. It has been calculated that when the wares from 
Calicut (in Malabar) reached Cairo, the ruler of the place, by various 
devices, exacted nearly one-third of their price as his own dues. 17 

In spite of heavy expenses the mercantile houses of Genoa and 
Venice reaped enormous profits, as the Indian goods fetched a very 
high price in European markets. 

It could hardly be expected that the monopoly of Venice and 
Genoa in the profitable eastern trade would be looked upon with 
equanimity by the adventurous maritime nations like the Spanish 
and the Portuguese. The wonderful geographical discoveries by 
these two nations in course of the fifteenth century A.D. induced 
the Pope, Alexander VI, to regulate the enterprise into the unknown 
world by dividing it between them. He issued no less than four 
bulls for this purpose in A. D. 1493-94, by which the countries to 
the east of Europe were assigned to Portugal. 

By this time the Portuguese had not only explored the entire 
western coast of Africa but even proceeded beyond the Cape of Good 
Hope. The lure of capturing the eastern trade naturally turned 
their attention towards an all-sea-route to India. For this would 
enable them to import goods from that country at a much cheaper 
cost and, by one stroke, transfer to them the huge wealth hitherto 
flowing to Genoa and Venice. Thus it was that Vasco da Gama 
was commissioned to find out a direct sea-route to India from Portu- 


420 


THE PORTUGUESE 


gal via Cape of Good Hope. On July 8, 1497, 18 Vasco da Gama left 
Lisbon with three vessels, of a tonnage varying from 60 to 150, on 
this perilous undertaking. 

IV. THE PORTUGUESE IN INDIA 

On May 17, 1498, 19 the inhabitants of the small village of 
Capucad, eight miles to the north of Calicut, saw the strange spec¬ 
tacle of three sailing vessels at anchor manned by white-skinned 
peoples unknown to them. The rural folk were amused, perhaps 
a little bewildered, but little did they dream that these were harbin¬ 
gers of untold sufferings to them and to their country. 

These were the vessels which, under the leadership of Vasco da 
Gama, by mere accident, touched the land at a point lying within 
the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut, to whom reference has been 
made above. It was almost providential that da Gama had not 
anchored off Gujarat, for this principality was then ruled by the 
Muslims, who were the sworn enemies of the Portuguese, their most 
deadly rivals in over-sea trade. 

The Zamorin, as usual, welcomed the strangers and provided 
all facilities to them in Calicut which was then an important centre 
of spice-trade. 20 This alarmed the powerful Muslim traders of 
Calicut who, not unreasonably, concluded that once the Portuguese 
got a footing in Calicut, they would extend their activities to all 
other ports and thus bring irretrievable ruin upon the Muslim 
traders. They therefore sought by every means in their power to 
prejudice the mind of the Zamorin against the new-comers. One 
objection which they urged before Zamorin’s officers proved to be 
prophetic. The Portuguese, they argued, had not certainly under¬ 
taken this long and tedious journey from their distant home “for 
mere purposes of trade, of which, being a ^wealthy nation, they had 
no need, but only to spy out the country with the view of returning 
and conquering it by force of arms and plundering it”. 21 The 
machinations of the Muslim traders, aided by large bribes to the 
officials, brought about an estrangement between the Portuguese 
and the Zamorin, and the high-handed actions of the former almost 
precipitated a crisis. In a fit of anger the Zamorin ordered that 
the goods in the Portuguese factory should be seized, and Vasco da 
Gama, together with his companions who were already prisoners, 
should be killed. But the chief Brahmana (priest?) and other 
officers induced the king to rescind the order, and brought about a 
reconciliation between him and the Portuguese. So when Vasco da 
Gama left the Indian shore on August 29, 1498, he had collected 
valuable information regarding trade and the route, and esta- 


421 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


blished friendly relations with the ruler and Hindu population of 
Calicut. 

The successful venture of Vasco da Gama induced the king of 
Portugal to send a larger fleet of 13 vessels under Pedro Alvarez 
Cabral on March 9, 1500. Cabral had a series of adventures on the 
way and reached Calicut with only six vessels on September 13, 
1500. The Zamorin cordially welcomed him, and a treaty of peace 
and friendship was concluded between the two. Thereupon the 
Portuguese established a factory at Calicut, but the Muslim traders 
placed every possible obstacle on their way of successful trade in 
spices. Cabral complained to the Zamorin and, in order to hasten 
his decision, attacked and seized a Muslim vessel that was loading in 
the harbour. These irritated the Muslim traders who attacked the 
Portuguese factory, killed Ayres Correa, the factor in charge, with 
fifty-three of his men, and destroyed the whole building. In revenge, 
Cabral destroyed ten Muslim vessels and bombarded the town of 
Calicut for two days. He then set sail and reached Cochin, another 
Hindu State, whose relation with the Zamorin has been noted above. 
Cabral signed a treaty of friendship with the Raja of Cochin, promis¬ 
ing to conquer Zamorin’s kingdom for him, and established a 
factory. Here, too, the Muslim traders were actively hostile, but 
the Hindu Raja helped the Portuguese in every way, even to the 
extent of placing a guard over the factory building and allowing the 
Portuguese to sleep within the walls of his palace. When the fleet 
sent by the Zamorin to chastise the Portuguese was sighted near 
Cochin harbour in January, 1501, the Raja of Cochin warned them of 
the danger and offered assistance. The fleet of the Zamorin sailed 
away, chased by Cabral. While still at Cochin, Cabral received 
friendly messages of co-operation from the Rajas of Cannanore and 
Quilon. On his return journey Cabral visited Cannanore and re¬ 
ceived on board an ambassador from the Raja to the king of Portugal 
with presents and the offer of free trade in his kingdom. Thus the 
two great feudatories of the Zamorin sought to recover their indepen¬ 
dence with the help of the Portuguese. 

On the basis of the report submitted by Cabral, the Portuguese 
king now entertained the ambitious project, not only to divert all 
Indian trade to Portugal by curbing the Arab ventures, but also to 
plant the Christian religion in India. With these ends in view he 
despatched in 1502 a fleet of twenty ships under Vasco da Gama. 

As the first discoverer of the direct sea-route between Europe 
and India, Vasco da Gama occupies a unique place in the history of 
the modern world. But in his treatment of the Indians he may be 
described almost as a monster in the disguise of human form, a 


422 


THE PORTUGUESE 


worthy compeer of Sultan Mahmud and Tamerlane, though on a 
much smaller scale. 

When his fleet reached Anjidiv, south of Goa, he committed a 
horrible cruelty described as follows by a European historian: “A 
rich Muslim pilgrim vessel on its way to India from the Red Sea was 
intercepted by da Gama’s fleet, plundered and sunk; there were many 
women and children on board; but to these no mercy was shown; and 
we actually read that da Gama watched the horrors of the scene 
through a porthole, merciless and unmoved”. 22 

After halting at Cannanore for a few days, and renewing friend¬ 
ship with its king, da Gama proceeded to Calicut. The reputation 
of the Portuguese as a fighting power had reached so high that all 
the Indian and Arab ships had left the harbour, and the Zamorin, 
fearful of vengeance, sent a Briahmana as an envoy with the most 
conciliatory proposal. He sent twelve Muslims, who were guilty of 
outrages against the Portuguese during their last visit to the city, 
and a large amount recovered as fines for plundering the Portuguese 
factory. But da Gama was not satisfied, and made the expulsion of 
all the Muslims out of the country ‘a preliminary condition to peace’. 
This being refused, da Gama bombarded the city for an entire day, 
killing many people and causing great damages to the city. 

While still off Calicut, da Gama seized “a fleet of two large ships 
and twenty-two smaller vessels” which, laden with rice, had sailed 
from Coromandel. After having plundered the ships, da Gama 
“ordered his men to cut off the hands and ears and noses of all the 
crews. This done, their feet were tied together, and in order to pre¬ 
vent them from untying the cords with their teeth, he ordered his 
men to strike them on their mouths with staves and knock their teeth 
down their throats. They were then put on board, to the number of 
about 800, heaped one on the top of the other, and covered with mats 
and dry leaves; the sails were then set for the shore and the vessel 
set on fire”. 23 The refined cruelty reserved for the Brahmana envoy 
sent by the Zamorin has perhaps no parallel in the history of the 
civilized world. His hands and ears were cut off, and he was sent 
back with the severed limbs carefully packed and a letter telling the 
king to make curry out of them and eat it. 24 

It has been truly observed that “da Gama had no bowels of com¬ 
passion”. 26 But his lieutenants were worthy of the Captain. The 
friendly Raja of Cannanore having complained to da Gama against 
some Muslim ships leaving his harbour without paying the harbour 
duties and the price of goods, Vincente Sodre was sent to help him. 
Sodre at once decided to sink all the ships, but the Raja prevented 
this cruel deed. The Muslim owner of the ships, an inhabitant of 


423 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Cairo, settled all pecuniary claims to the satisfaction of the Raja, but 
as he was reported to have uttered some insulting words, Vincente 
Sodre “had him tied to the mast and flogged with a rope’s-end until he 
fainted. Having filled his mouth with dirt, and tied over it a piece 
of bacon, he sent him back to his ship with his hands tied behind 
him”. 26 


The Indians thus had a foretaste of the barbarous and inhuman 
cruelties which characterized the Portuguese almost throughout the 
period of their dominance in Indian waters. 

Vasco da Gama established a factory at Cochin and erected a 
defensive palisade at Cannanore. He then returned to Portugal, 
leaving Vincente Sodre with six vessels and a caravel to patrol the 
coast. The Portuguese could not save Cochin from the revenge of 
the Zamorin who overran the country, forcing its Raja and his Portu¬ 
guese friends to take refuge in an island. But in 1503 three 
Portuguese squadrons arrived in Cochin, one of them commanded by 
the famous Affonso d’Albuquerque. The troops of the Zamorin were 
driven away from Cochin, and peace was concluded between the 
rulers of Calicut and Cochin. It was on this occasion that the 
Portuguese built at Cochin their first fortress in India. 

In 1505, the Portuguese king adopted a new policy. Instead of 
sending annual expedition, and leaving a small garrison to protect 
the factories, he decided to appoint a Viceroy who would reside in 
India for three years. Francisco d’Alemeida, the first Viceroy, arrived 
in September, 1505, and made Cochin his headquarters. He strengthen¬ 
ed and rebuilt the fort there, and also erected forts at Anjidiv (south 
of Goa) and Cannanore. The former was shortly abandoned and 
the Portuguese troops were concentrated in Cochin and Cannanore. 
There were several clashes with Muslim trading vessels in which 
the Portuguese were uniformly successful. The Zamorin of Calicut, 
alarmed at the growing power of the Portuguese in Indian waters, 
made a serious effort to drive them away. “In March 1506, an engage¬ 
ment took place between a large fleet of Muhammadan traders, 
armed and equipped by the Zamorin, and a Portuguese fleet of four 
vessels, resulting in the capture of the largest Muslim ships and a 
veritable massacre of their crews, with no casualties among the Por¬ 
tuguese”. 27 

The intention of the Portuguese to settle in India permanently, 
so clearly revealed by the establishment of a residential Viceroy 
and a standing fleet, as well as the construction of forts, alarmed the 
Muslim rulers of Bijapur, Gujarat and other smaller States. The 
establishment of Portuguese supremacy in Arabian Sea had also 
seriously affected the interest of Arabia and Egypt by depriving 


424 


THE PORTUGUESE 


them of the duties levied on Indian goods. So when the Muslim 
rulers of India appealed to the Sultan of Egypt for aid, he readily 
agreed, and sent a fleet under Amir Husain who, in January 1508, 
severely defeated a Portuguese fleet, sent against it, off Chaul, in 
Konkan coast, less than twenty miles to the south of Bombay. The 
son of the Portuguese Viceroy, who commanded the fleet, lost his 
life. But next year, in February, 1509, the Viceroy Almeida avenged 
the death of his son by inflicting a crushing defeat on the Muslim 
fleet off Diu on the Gujarat coast. 

In November, 1509, Affonso d’Albuquerque succeeded Viceroy 
Almeida, under the lower title of Governor of India. 28 Earlier in 
the year the Portuguese had made an unsuccessful attack on Calicut. 
One of the first acts of Albuquerque was to carry out the specific 
instruction of the king of Portugal to destroy Calicut, for, said he, 
nothing he would undertake with greater pleasure than the destruc¬ 
tion of Calicut. The naval expedition arrived off Calicut on January 
3, 1510. The Zamorin was absent, as was already ascertained by the 
spies of the Raja of Cochin, and the town, which contained but few 
troops, was sacked by the Portuguese. But then the people drove 
away the Portuguese who sailed back. Albuquerque himself re¬ 
ceived two -wounds and a number of high officers were killed. 

The first achievement of Albuquerque was the conquest of Goa 
which belonged to the ‘Adil Shahl rulers of Bijapur. On March 4, 
1510, he occupied the defenceless city which offered little resistance, 
though he w r as forced to abandon it in the face of an attack by 
Yusuf ‘Adil Khan. But Albuquerque stormed the city in November, 
1510, strengthened its fortifications, and decided to make it his head¬ 
quarters. In order to increase its commercial importance Albu¬ 
querque took steps to force all ships to put into Goa. He also pro¬ 
vided all encouragement and facilities to traders, so that even Mus¬ 
lim traders in spices settled there. In order to have a substantial 
number of friendly people, he authorized a large number of Portu¬ 
guese to marry Indian wives, and encouraged them by allotting lands, 
houses and cattle. 29 

The Muslim Sultan had increased the taxes, but Albuquerque 
reduced it to the rate prevalent under Hindu rule. He further con¬ 
ciliated the Hindus by appointing them to government offices in 
larger numbers. He established a mint for the coinage of gold, silver, 
and copper money. 

The fall of Goa and the defeat of the Sultan of Bijapur made a 
profound impression on the Indian rulers. The Captain of the 
Egyptian fleet, who had been waiting at Cambay for reinforcements, 
now sailed back to Suez. The Muslim Sultan of Gujarat released 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the Portuguese prisoners and sent an ambassador to Albuquerque 
to conclude a treaty of peace by offering Diu to the Portuguese for 
erecting a fort. 30 The Zamorin also made friendly overtures, offer* 
ing a site within his kingdom for the construction of a Portuguese 
factory. This was established in 1511, but finally abandoned in 
1525. 

The greatest achievement of Albuquerque was the conquest 
of Malacca in 1511. It was a master-stroke of policy, designed to 
ruin the profits enjoyed by the Muslim rulers of Arabia and Egypt 
and the trade of Venice with them. The capture of Malacca was 
hailed with joy in Portugal, and the Pope celebrated it by a series of 
splendid ceremonies. 

Taking advantage of the absence of Albuquerque, the Sultan of 
Bijapur had sent a force under Pulad Khan, who seized not only the 
mainland territories of Goa but even the island itself. Pulad Khan 
then fortified himself in Benasterim, only six miles from the city of 
Goa, which commanded the principal passage from the mainland to 
the island of Goa. A new commander, Rassel Khan, with a large 
force and artillery, replaced Pulad Khan and besieged the city. As 
soon as Albuquerque returned to Cochin he made arrangements for 
the relief of Goa. He himself reached the place in October 1512 and 
after a gallant attack forced the Bijapur commander to surrender 
Benasterim and evacuate the island (1512). This victory enhanced his 
reputation and the Sultans of Bijapur and Gujarat again sent envoys 
to conclude peace. 

Albuquerque then proceeded to Aden and Jidda in 1513, and, 
apart from diplomatic success, obtained possession of Ormuz, an 
important centre of trade. He died in December, 1515, after an 
eventful career in course of which the power and reputation of 
Portugal were firmly established in the eastern countries. 

Four governors succeeded Affonso d’Albuquerque, the last of 
whom, Vasco da Gama, now sixty-four years old, reached India in 
September, and died in December, 1524. During the next five years 
there were three governors, the last of whom, Nino da Cunha, 
reached India in November, 1529. One of his first acts was to trans¬ 
fer the headquarters of the government from Cochin to Goa. This 
scheme had been originally proposed and highly favoured by Affonso 
d’Albuquerque, but was strongly opposed by a large section of the 
Portuguese officials in India. They sent a strong remonstrance to the 
king of Portugal against it, and even suggested the rendition of Goa 
to the Sultan of Bijapur in order to gain his friendship and co-opera¬ 
tion. Albuquerque sent a long reply, 31 answering all the arguments 
of his hostile critics. On receipt of this letter King Dom Manoel of

4. Above, p. 197, where Bhanudeva II is a printing mistake for Bhanudeva III. 
It is necessary to point out that the Muslim historians of this period refer to 
Orissa as Jajnagar, probably a corruption of Yayatinagara. The identification 
of Jajnagar was for long a matter of dispute, but there is now a general con¬ 
sensus of opinion that it stands for Orissa ( P1HC, IX. 215).

15. Tire date of Bhanudeva IV’s accession is still a matter of dispute. The latest 
known date of his predecessor, Narasimha IV, is A.D. 1402, and the earliest 
definitely ascertained date of Bhanudeva IV is A.D. 1414. An inscription 
found at Srikurmam equates the 3rd Anka year of Bhanudeva IV with a date 
in the Saka year expressed by the words sun (i.e. 12), arrow (5), and sea (4). 
Venkataramanayya read the date as 4512 and, referring it to the Kali era, 
placed the accession of Bhanudeva IV in A.D. 1409 ( JOR , XIX. 135-47). This 
was originally suggested by M. S. Sharma in The History of the Reddi 
Kingdoms . p. 189. But this view is opposed by D. C. Sircar (JOR, XXII, 
47 ff-), who further maintains, on good grounds, that king Bhanudeva men¬ 
tioned in the inscription is Bhanudeva III and not Bhanudeva IV. All that 
can be definitely said in the present state of our knowledge, therefore, is that 
Bhanudeva IV ascended the throne some time between A.D. 1402 and 1414.

Orissa were then looked upon as very useful from military point of view, and 
many Muslim rulers raided Orissa to secure them.

24. According to the Idupulupadu grant dated A.D. 1500, Vira Rudra, king of 
Utkala, defeated the king of Gauda. The earliest reference to Husain Shah’s 
invasion of Orissa is to be found in a series of coins issued in A.D. 1504-5- 
The latest reference is contained in the Velicherla plates of Prataparudra 
which state that the king of Gau$a fled on his approach. There were probably 
several invasions, or, more properly speaking, a series of border raids, culmi¬ 
nating occasionally in regular invasions, during the first decade of the sixteenth 
century A.D. It is probable that the state of hostilities continued beyond 1510. 
It appears from the biographies of Chaitanya that hostilities were in progress 
when he first went from Bengal to Puri in 1510, and again in 1513 or 1514 
when he returned to Bengal. Cf. HBS. 147-8; P. Mukherjee, The History of 
the Gajapati Kings of Orissa, 73-5. Mukherjee’s elaborate arguments to prove 
that Husain Shah’s invasion took place after October, 1510, is unconvincing. 

25. P. Mukherjee, op. cit., 78. An inscription at Hampi, dated January, 1510, 
describes Krishnadeva as “fever to the elephants of the Gajapati”. From this 
Venkataramanayya inferred that hostilities between the two had broken out 
before that date ( Further Sources, I 189). But, as P. Mukherjee rightly 
points out (op. cit. 77-8), such expressions need not be taken to imply actual 
war. The war certainly broke out in 1513, but barring the above inscription, 
there is no reference to any campaign of Krishnadeva against Orissa at an 
earlier date. Venkataramanayya also now evidently adheres to this view 
(cf. p. 311 above). 

26. According to Venkataramanayya, “after Krishnaraya’s return from Simhadri, 
the army which he left behind proceeded against Orissa, and after laying the 
country waste advanced upon Cuttack and sacked it” ( Further Sources, I. 211). 
This view, repeated on p. 313 above, is based upon both literary and epigraphic 
evidence. P. Mukherjee argues against it, pointing out that similar claims 
were put forward on behalf of other kings, and some Gajapati kings are said 
to have conquered the city of Vijayanagara; op. cit. 93-95. (Ed.).

convincing. Cf. Further Sources, I. 231.

son’s Edition. Other forms are Dalju, Zulchu and Zulquadr Khan (Sufi; 
Kashmir, 118). Some historians have assigned a Turkish, Mongol or Tatar 
origin to him. According to the RT, II, v. 152 (all the verses in this chapter 
including those in the notes refer to RT, Peterson’s Edition, unless otherwise 
mentioned), Dulucha was the chamupati (leader of the army) of Karmasena, 
but Abu-’l Fazl calls him Kalju, the commander-in-chief of the king of 
Kandahar (Ain, II. 383). 

3. The name of Rinchana is written in various forms such as Ratanju, Ranju 
Shah, Rechan, Renchan, Rainchan Shah, Ranjpoi and Ratanchan. Rinchana, 
used in the RT, II. (v. 158), seems to be the correct form. RT, II. (vv. 157 ff.) 
gives a detailed account of the family and early career of Rinchana. Accord¬ 
ing to this authority there was a simultaneous invasion of Kashmir by Dulucha 
and Rinchana (v. 168), but others differ. 


429 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Rinchana has been identified with king rGyal-bu Rin-c’en of Ladakh 
(Pandit D. R. Sahni and A. H. Francke, References to the Bhottas or Bhaut- 
tas in The Rajatarangini of Kashmir, IA, XXXVII, 187); but the identifica¬ 
tion, though probable, raises many difficulties and L. Petech rejects it (L. 
Petech: A Study on the Chronicles of Ladakh, 112. Issued as a supplement 
to IHQ, XV). 

4. After referring to the invasion of Rinchana, Jonaraja suddenly introduces 
“Ramachandra, the moon of his dynasty,” as having opposed the invader at 
every step (v. 198), but does not refer to Suhadeva any more. He then refers 
to the marriage of the invader Rinchana with “the queen Kota”, “the white 
lily ( kalha, kalpa, in Calcutta Edition) in the garden of Ramachandra’s house¬ 
hold” (v. 201). Dr. Sufi calls Ramachandra the commander-in-chief of Suha¬ 
deva and Kota, his daughter. There is no authority in the RT for the first 
statement, and the expression used by Jonaraja may mean that Kota was the 
wife rather than the daughter of Ramachandra. After stating all this the RT 
says that the king left the city (II, v. 202), but it is not quite clear whether 
he means Suhadeva or Ramachandra. 

5. The chronology of the kings of Kashmir, as adopted in this chapter, differs 
from that given in the CHI, III, Ch. XII, but generally agrees with the RT. 
The question has been fully discussed by the author of this chapter in JASL, 
XXII. 85. 

5a. The date of Rinchana’s death, as given in the RT, corresponds, according to 
Dr. Vogel, to Friday, November 25, 1323 (IA, XXXVII, 186, f.n.).

10. RT, II. vv. 255-7, Jonaraja does not state the relationship, if any, of Udayana 
with Rinchana or the old royal family, but refers elsewhere (v. 230) to 
Udayanadeva of Gandhara, who may be the same person. According to 
H. C. Ray ( DHNI , I. 179) Udayana was a relative of Rinchana, and according 
to Sufi (op. cit. 127-8) he was the brother of Suhadeva, but none cites any 
authority. It appears from the RT, II. vv. 256 and 261 that Udayana was 
the chief of the Lavanyas

15. Sufi has expressed surprise that Kota Rani, “being the wife of a staunch 

Muslim,... adopted a course which throws doubts on her adhesion to the 
Muslim faith” (op. cit., p. 127). Evidently he never even thought of the 

possibility that her husband Rinchana might not, after all, be a staunch 

Muslim.

19. Jonaraja says: “The king, now king only in name, died after having suffered 

troubles for one year and ten months in Kashmir” (RT, II. v. 387, Eng. 
Tr. 35). It is not quite clear whether this period is included in the total 

reign-period of twelve years assigned to ‘All Sher, or represents a period 

before he formally assumed sovereignty after his brother’s death. 

20. RT, II. v. 407; Eng. Tr. 37. 

21. Jonaraja does not mention the relationship between Shihab-ud-dln and ‘Ala¬ 
nd-din. According to Firishta, they were brothers (Briggs, IV, 458; also cf. 
TA, III, 640) and this view has been adopted in CHI, III, 278.

shows that Hindu Khan was the name of the king’s brother whom he ap¬ 
pointed his successor. Evidently his name, given as Hindal by Firishta and 
Nizam-ud-din, is a corruption of Hindu Khan or vice versa.

29a. Briggs, IV. 464-5. This is corroborated by RT, v. 765. 

30. Briggs, IV. 464-6 (Italics mine). It is to be noted that according to Firishta 
the rite of sati was stopped by Sikandar. But neither Nizam-ud-dln nor 
Jonaraja makes any reference to it. On the other hand the latter states that 
Suhabhatta had stopped the practice of cremating the dead bodies (w. 1317- 
18); and thus there was no occasion for sati. Though Zain-ul-’Abidln restored 
to the Hindus their right to cremate dead bodies, one should accept with utmost 
caution Sir Wolseley Haig’s statement with reference to Sikandar that “with 
many innocuous Hindu rites the barbarous practice of burning widows with 
their deceased husbands was prohibited”, and also his righteous exhortation 
that Zain-ul-‘AbidIn “might well have excluded from his scheme of toleration 
the immolation of widows” (CHI, III, 280-1). Sir Wolseley Haig does not cite 
any authority for his incredible statement: “The fierce intolerance of Sikandar 
had left in Kashmir no more than eleven families of Brahmans practising the 
ceremonies of their faith” (CHI, IH. 281). 

31. Sufi, op. cit. 148 ff. Sufi tries to minimise the enormity of the acts of the 
Sultan by pointing out that similar religious persecutions took place also in 
Europe about this time. But in spite of all these he admits that “one cannot 
entirely exonerate him (Sikandar) from the heavy responsibility of coun¬ 
tenancing the religious persecution practised by his ministers and officials 
...” (p. 149).

(RT, II, v. 924). But Nizam-ud-dln calls him the king of Jammu (TA, III, 
ii, 650). 

36. Some support for this statement is found in the Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi 
(Tr. by K. K. Basu, G.O.S., p. 200) which states: “.. .in the month of Jamadl- 
ul-auwal, 823 A.H. (May-June, 1420 A.D.), Sultan ‘All, King of Kashmir, 
who took his cohorts to Thatha, had on his way back been opposed by Jasrath, 
when the Sultan’s army was driven pellmell, a portion being still in Thatha, 
and a part only came out. Incapable of sustaining the attack, it made a 
stampede: Sultan ‘All was made captive, and his baggage and provisions were 
plundered.” Slightly different accounts of ‘All Shah’s hostility with Shahi 
Khan are given by different authorities.

muskets were manufactured in Kashmir at this time. Srivara states that gun¬ 
powder was introduced during this reign and has given a detailed description 
of fireworks, which he must have seen. For details cf. BV, XVI, 11. The 
question of the introduction of firearms in India will be discussed in chapter

7. For the status of Ghiyas-ud-dln Bahadur, see above pp. 193-5. According 
to 1 Alamgir-nama (p. 731), Muhammad bin Tughluq “sent 100,000 horsemen, 
well-equipped, to Assam, but the whole army perished in that land of witch¬ 
craft and not a trace of it was left.” No other Muslim chronicle refers to 
this expedition, and it seems to refer to the conquest of Ghiyas-ud-dln Baha¬ 
dur who, at least nominally, acknowledged the supremacy of Muhammad 
Tughluq, and may therefore be taken to act on his behalf. It may also be 
a confused echo of Muhammad Tughluq’s expedition against Quraehal men¬ 
tioned above, on pp. 73-4. But some historians have accepted it to be a 
historical fact (Gait, op. cit., 35; S. N. Bhattacharyya, A History of Mughal 
North-East Frontier Policy, p. 61). Bhattacharyya finds a corroboration of 
the expedition in the discovery of a number of coins of Muhammad Tugh¬ 
luq, dated 733-4 A.H. (A.D. 1332-4), in the Mymensingh District in Bengal. 
But this is satisfactorily explained by the conquest of this region by Ghiyas- 
ud-dln Bahadur. 

8. This is proved by a coin with the mint name “Chawlistan alias Kamrup” 
issued in 759 A.H. (A.D. 1357-8). Mr. Stapleton’s view that the expedition 
was directed against, and confined to, the north and east of the old course of 
the Brahmaputra in the Mymensingh District is not supported by any argu¬ 
ment sufficient to reject the evidence of coins, which proves an effective esta¬ 
blishment of Muslim authority in Kamarupa some time before A.D. 1357.

II. MITHILA 

1. This is the traditional boundary (Singh. 2-3; above, Vol. V, p. 47). The 
Purnea District lying to the east of the Kosi river is not included in Mithila, 
as envisaged in this chapter. 

2. Vol. V, 47-8. 

3. A great deal has been written regarding the relation of Tirhut with Muslim 
powers. Much of it is based on mere legends or vague general statements 
which are not supported by any reliable evidence. The confusion between 
Bihar and Tirhut, which were two separate States in medieval India, and the 
inclusion of Purnea in Tirhut are responsible for applying to Tirhut what 
merely applies to Bihar (modern South Bihar) or Purnea alone. All these 
references, which will be found in Thakur (391 ff.) and RKC (109-113), are 
omitted here. Even the treatment of legendary history is complicated by the 
fact that names of kings of Mithila, alleged to have been fighting with or 


432 


INDEPENDENT STATES 


allied to Muslim rulers, have been identified with different kings by different 
writers. Only those Muslim invasions or raids on Tirhut are referred to in 
this chapter which are based on some reliable evidence, but even all these 
cannot be regarded as authentic historical facts. It has been held, for example, 
in CHI (III, 260) that Muhammad Bakhtyar took possession of the south¬ 
eastern parts of Mithiia which is defined as the country west of the Mahananda. 
On the basis of this statement Thakur holds that Bakhtyar “not only con¬ 
quered but annexed Mithiia, at least its south-eastern parts” (p. 393), although 
he correctly takes Tirhut or Mithiia as the country bounded on the east by 
the river Kosi (p. 2). The whole theory seems to rest on the statement in 
Tabaqat-i-Nasiri that “Muhammad Bakhtyar led his troops towards the moun¬ 
tains of Kamrud and Tirhut”. This vague statement can hardly justify the 
theory of conquest, far less, of annexation. 

4. Baverty, 587-8. According to Badauni, Hisam-ud-dln “became possessed of the 
whole country of Tirhut and Bengala and Jajnagar and Kamrud” (Ranking’s 
Tr. I, 86). This shows what little reliance can be placed on later Muslim 
chroniclers who magnify a plundering raid or nominal suzerainty into com¬ 
plete conquest and annexation. It must be noted, however, that the simple 
statement in the Tabaqat-i-Nasirl, as quoted above, is reproduced in TA (I. 59) 
without any embellishment. Dr. K. R. Qanungo also takes an exaggerated 
view of the conquest of Twaz, though he does not refer to Badauni. The 
following statement, in HBS, p. 22, about the weak political condition of 
Tirhut which gave ‘Xwaz the opportunity of aggression against Tirhut is very 
misleading: “The old Karnataka kingdom of Mithiia was about this time 
breaking into fragments after the death of Arimalladeva and these princes in 
despair of holding their possessions in the plains hemmed in between the 
Muslim province of Oudh on one side and the territory of Lakhnawati on the 
other—were seeking compensation in the valley of Nepal. The ruler of Eastern 
Tirhut could not but come within the sphere of influence of Laknawati.” 
Arimalla was not a king of Tirhut, but of Nepal, and there is no evidence 
to show, either that Tirhut was broken into fragments, or that its rulers took 
any aggressive attitude against Nepal at this time or at any subsequent date 
before A.D. 1314. 

5. Raverty, 737; See also Vol. V. 141. 

6. No authority has been cited for the statement that “Iltutmish is said to have 
conquered portion of Mithiia” (RKC. 110). Further statements that follow 
are also not supported by any evidence. Firishta refers to Iltutmish’s expedi¬ 
tion against Bihar (Briggs, I, 208), but nothing about Tirhut which constituted 
a separate State. According to Prof. S. H. Askari there is an inscription of 
the time of Iltutmish in Tirhut (RKC, 110, f.n. 3), but no account of it has 
yet been published, 

7. It has been stated in the History of Bengal, Vol. II, that the first expedition 
sent against Bengal by Balban under Malik Turmati, governor of Awadh, 
advanced by way of Tirhut (HBS, 61). There is, however, no mention of 
Tirhut in BaranI’s account of the first expedition under Amir Khan, governor 
of Awadh, or in Firishta’s account of this and the second expedition under 
Tirmuny or Malik Turmati of Yahya. It is to be remembered that, generally 
speaking, the Muhammadans “on their way to Lakhanawatl marched from 
Oudh via Bihar, and did not try to pass north of the Ganges” (MC, 407). 

8. Thakur’s statement (p. 276) that ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl conquered the whole 
of Bihar, including Tirhut, is based on vague unreliable traditions, and his 
arguments do not bear a moment’s scrutiny (His reference to Firishta and 
Ain-i-Akbari seems to be wrong). The alleged supremacy of ‘Ala-ud-dln 
Khaljl over Nepal has been discussed in connection with the history of that 
country. 

9. MC, 407-8.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


18. Thakur, relying on Mithila traditions, places the accession of Harisirhha 
about A.D- 1303 or 1307 (p. 279), but M. Chakravarti places his reign in the 
last decade of the thirteenth century (p. 411), and R.K. Chaudhari plaecs 
his accession in A.D. 1285 (RKC, 113). The colophon of a MS. of Bhattikavya- 
tika gives the date La Sam 159 for Srimad-dharasimhadeva, who may be easily 
identified with Harisirhhadeva, also called Harasirhhadeva. As will be noted 
below, the initial date of La Sam era varies between A.D. 1107 and 1120. 
It is not, therefore, surprising that the astronomical details given in the colo¬ 
phon do not agree, if La Sam 159 is taken to be equivalent to A.D. 1279, 
on the generally accepted view that La Sam commenced in A.D. 1120. The 
colophon may, therefore, be taken to indicate that Harisirhha ascended 
the throne about A.D. 1279. (Petech, 195; Sastri, Catalogue, VII, p. 66, 
No. 5067). 

19. MC., 411., 

20. M.C., 411. The Varhsavalls of Nepal refer to the invasions of the country by 
Tirhut ruler in A.D. 1291 and 1311 (Petech, 103). 

21. HIED, III, 234. 

22. Evidently the two kings were Bahadur and Nasir-ud-din. 

23. This extract from ‘Isami’s Futuh-us-Saldtln, composed about the middle of the 
14th century A.D., is based on the Hindi translation of Rizvi ( TKB , I. 90). 
Professor R. K. Chaudhary informs me that there is a striking agreement 
between the account of Tsami and that given in an unpublished MS. of Bastin- 
ul-uns whose author accompanied Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq to Tirhut. The 
work was composed in the first year of the reign of Muhammad-bin-Tughluq. 
The MS. is now in the British Museum (Add. 7717). 

24. Briggs, I, 406-7. 

25. There are other instances of similar exaggeration by later Muslim chroni¬ 
clers, even in respect of Tirhut, as will be related later in connection with 
the conquest of that kingdom by Sikandar Lodi. 

26. MC., 411, f.n. It is somewhat disconcerting to find that Firishta’s account 
should be unanimously accepted, even after the discovery of Futuh-us-Salatin. 

27. The same argument applies to Firishta’s statement “that as the king was pass¬ 
ing near the hills of Tirhoot, the Raja appeared in arms, but was pursued into 
the woods” (Briggs, I, 406-7)- 

28. Levy, II, 224. For a slightly different form of the verse cf. AIOC , II, 564.

30. Thakur, 283-4. 

31. TKB, I, 37. HIED , III, 236, where instead of ‘early years’ we find ‘twenty- 
seven years’. It is to be noted, however, that Tirhut is not included in the list 
of 23 provinces constituting the empire of Muhammad bin Tughluq, unless 
Telinga, repeated twice, be taken as a mistake for Tirhut. It appears to be 
very likely, in the light of later events, that Tirhut was not incorporated in 
the empire as a province under a governor, but was left to its Hindu ruler on 
condition of paying tribute. For the list of 23 provinces, Cf. Thomas, Chronicles 
of the Pathan Kings of Delhi , p. 203, f.n. 1. For the coins of Muhammad bin 
Tughluq, cf. Rogers, Indian Museum Coins , Part I, p. 63, Nos. 12911-2. 

32. Presumably because it has not been translated by Elliot. 

33. TKB, II, 41 (Italics is mine). 

34. This will be discussed in the next section. 

35. There is no reason to suppose that Ilyas’s invasion to Tirhut had any more 
lasting result than that of Nepal- The statement in HBS, p. 104, that Ilyas 
Shah ‘conquered’ or ‘subjugated’ Tirhut is hardly borne out by Barani’s passing 
remark that Ilyas ‘invaded Tirhut’, as will be seen from the account given 
in this chapter. The detailed accounts of the conquest of Tirhut, its division 
into two parts etc. (RKC, 120), do not rest upon any reliable evidence.

40. Thakur, 295, 290- It is not a little curious that on p. 407, Thakur states, 
or rather reproduces, with approval, the statement in HBS, 103-4 that “the 
successors of Harisirhha held their court at Simraon, and Kamesvara, the 
nominee of Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq, at Sugauna.” This not only contradicts 
his two statements, namely: (1) “The Sultan of Delhi gave the kingdom to 


484

Kamesvara in c. 1353 A.D.” (p. 290); (2) that Kamesvara “ruled for a very 

short period and was probably deposed by Feroz Shah” (p. 295), but also 
his observations on p. 288 on the “tragic exit” of the Karnata family “from 
the political stage of Northern India” after Harisimsa’s flight to Nepal.

47. These coins were found in a village called Pipra in the Champaran District. 
They are described by R. D. Banerji who refers them to Sivasimha (Ann. Rep. 
Arch. Surv. of India, 1813-14, p. 248, pi. LXVII 13.). 

Thakur expresses doubts about the genuineness of the coins (pp. 319-20), 
but evidently on wrong presumptions- One of his grounds, namely the “ex¬ 
tensive find-spot” (sic) of Sivashhha’s coins, seems to be due to a misunder¬ 
standing of R. D- Banerji’s statement. 

47a. See above, p. 188.

48. For the text of the inscription with an English translation, cf. IA, XLIV, 190- 
91. The La Sam date is taken by some as 292 The Saka and Vikrama Samvat 
dates correspond regularly to 10th July, A.D. 1399. This corresponds to Fasli 
Sam 807, but not to La Sam 292 or 293 if its initial era is taken to be A.D. 1120 
or 1119 (Bhandarkar’s List No- 1470). But, as noted below, the epoch of the 
La Sam varies between A.D. 1107 and 1120. 

49. JASB, 1898, p. 96; MC., 421-2. 

50. M.C., 422. 

51. HBR, 237. As stated in the next sentence, La Sam 293 is made equivalent 
to Saka 1324, which would make A.D. 1109 as the starting date of the era. It 
is noteworthy that in the copper-plate grant mentioned above, La Sam 293 
is given as equivalent to Saka 1321. This pushes back the starting point of 
the La Sam by three years. For, even if we take the grant as spurious, the 
forger would be normally expected to give equivalent dates- 

52. MC., 421. 

53. IA, XVIII, 58. According to a Bayaz of Mulla Taqyya, a 17th century writer, 
Sivasimha rebelled against his father and occupied the throne. When 
Ibrahim Shah, the Sharql, Sultan of Jaunpur, proceeded against Raja Ganesa 
of Bengal (p. 206), Sivasimha, instigated by the latter, opposed Ibrahim and 
was defeated and captured by him who thereupon restored the dispossessed father 
of Sivasimha to his throne. ( Bengal Past and Present, Vol. LXVII, 36). This 
event probably occurred in A.D- 1415-16- The truth of this uncorroborated 
story may be doubted. 

54. I A, XVIII, 55. As an instance of the absolutely untrustworthy character of 
popular legends, on which the historians of Tirhut (Thakur, RKC) seem to 
have relied too much, reference may be made to one which gives a diame¬ 
trically opposite version. There is a legend about Vidyapati, that by an 
exhibition of his miraculous powers of seeing things which were happening 
at a great distance, he released Sivasimha who was taken captive by the 
Emperor of Delhi (IA, XIV, 189).

59. MC., 427, f.n. 4. 

60. Thakur, 335-6. But the conquest of Gauda seems merely a conventional 
phrase. 

61. Dorn writes, on the authority of Makhzan-i-Afghtina, that “Sikandar pro¬ 
ceeded to Sirhut (mistake for Tirhut) whose Raja, submitting, received him 
solemnly and offered some lakhs of Tankas as a tribute and present; for 
the receipt of which the Sultan left Mubarak Khan behind” ( History of the 
Afghans, p. 58). There was thus no conquest, and the concluding part of 
the passage clearly implies that there was no question of annexation. 
BadaunTs account, as usual (see f.n. 4 and 25), is misleading, for he remarks 
that “the Sultan proceeded to Tirhut and conquered it” (A.D. 1490) (Ran¬ 
king’s Tr. I, 416).

9a. Levi, 230 ff. An entirely different view is taken by Petech (Mediaeval History

aristocratic family founded by Aneka Rama (A.D. 1332-1356), whose son Jaya- 
sirhha Rama Mahatha (A.D. 1360-1396) assumed the status of “Lord Protector 
of the Realm” and, during the last decade of the fourteenth century, wielded 
far greater authority than the nominal king Jayasthitimalla, in Patan. Accord¬ 
ing to Petech “the Ramas must have told the imperial envoys that they were 
the sovereigns of Nepal, and that the Mallas were only their vassals” (op. 
cit., 210). Apart from the highly incredible nature of this assumption, it 
hardly fits in with the picture of Nepal under Jayasthitimalla which Petech 
himself has drawn (op. cit., 139).

A.D. 1178 and is known to have been ruling in A.D. 1180 (Itihdsa, a Bengali

that jizya was a secular tax, as some have argued ( IBH. , 192, f.n. 4), but 
merely shows that a Muslim writer was under the impression that everyone 
following a religious system other than that of the ruler had to pay a tax 
similar to the j izya, —a custom with which he was only too familiar.

CHAPTER XIV 


ISLAMIC POLITICAL THEORY, ADMINISTRATIVE 
ORGANIZATION, LAW AND LEGAL 

INSTITUTIONS 

I. THEORY OF STATE 

The political theory of Medieval Islam was based on the teachings 
of the Qur’an, the traditions of the Prophet, precedent, and Greek 
thought. The first three can be lumped together as Muslim theology 
which was expanded and developed by Muslim jurists, and which, 
so far as political notions and organization were concerned, defined 
their legal basis. The Greek philosophers provided the ideas which 
were put forward as the rational justification for the institutions 
adopted or developed by the Muslims. It inevitably followed that 
the philosophic interpretation also affected the attitude of the people 
towards the institutions. 

The Qur’an laid down only the broad principles of social life and 
political organization. It emphasized the need of solidarity and 
unity among all Muslims and condemned any attempt to break away 
from the organized community; it made it obligatory on all Muslims 
to obey constituted authority; it enjoined consultation for the pur¬ 
pose of administering the affairs of the community . 1 To prevent 
the misuse of power, it laid down that a man’s first obligation was to 
God and, therefore, no believer should obey an authority if its in¬ 
junctions transgressed the dictates of religion . 2 It is obvious that 
these teachings only enunciate the fundamental principles on which 
Islamic policy could be based, but they do not seek to bring into 
existence any well-defined institution. 

The Prophet, as the teacher and leader of his followers, gradual¬ 
ly found himself to be the head of a State. The process was slow and 
gradual, and the Muslims had time to develop a few institutions suited 
to their needs and ideals. Their attitude was essentially practical; 
in the light of their principles, they tried to administer their affairs. 
We find the Prophet consulting his immediate disciples informally 
on all mundane problems as they came up for solution; as new 7 tribes 
came into the fold of Islam, he appointed trusted Muslims to guide 
them in managing their affairs in accordance with Islam. This in¬ 
cluded the administration of law and the settlement of disputes. 



ISLAMIC POLITICAL THEORY 


Sometimes the collection of religious taxes was also entrusted to 
these deputies. 

The death of the Prophet confronted the Muslims with several 
problems of great difficulty. It was obvious that it would be suicidal 
for the young community to remain without an organization, but 
what was to be its nature? Who was to be the head of the Muslim 
State? Was it necessary to have a single head? How was he to be 
selected? Beyond the principles enunciated by the Qur’an, already 
mentioned, there was little to guide the community. The Prophet 
had abstained from nominating a successor or laying down any rules. 
Sectarian traditions to the contrary may be dismissed as later fabri¬ 
cations in face of the historical evidence that they were not advanc¬ 
ed at the time of election. Nothing, however, could be more natural 
than what actually happened. The leaders met in their usual 
assembly house and chose one, who, by his piety and eminence, 
seemed to be the natural leader. The most significant fact in the 
election is that the separatist tendency of the Ansar who proposed 
that there should be two Imams, one for the Quraish and the other 
for themselves, was ruled out because that would have divided 
Islam. The decision of the leaders, whose choice fell on Abu Bakr, 
was communicated to the people who confirmed it by giving alle¬ 
giance. The importance of this election in Islamic history cannot 
be over-emphasized. It provided the later jurists with a precedent 
on which they could base their theories of succession, not only to the 
caliphate, but also to kingship. The immediate significance, how¬ 
ever, did not lie in the method of election; the person elected was to 
exercise a deep influence on the subsequent history of the Muslim 
world. Certain Bedouin tribes refused to pay zakdt. They did not 
forsake their faith in Islam; in refusing to pay the legal taxes they 
were trying to revert to tribal anarchy; they wanted to break away 
from the central authority. This endeavour was considered an act 
of apostasy by the Caliph who, in spite of the critical nature of the 
situation, decided to wage a jihad against the rebels to bring them 
back to their allegiance. Pie thus re-emphasized the principle of 
the indivisibility of Islam . 3 A natural corollary was that the entire 
Muslim world should offer allegiance to a single head, who was 
called Imam or Khalifah . 4 This principle, however, received a rude 
shock, when the ‘Abbasids, having successfully revolted against the 
Umayyads, failed to establish their authority in the western ex¬ 
tremity of the Muslim world. The V/estern Caliphate thrived in 
north-western Africa and Spain, and did not own allegiance to the 
‘Abbasids. Similarly the Fatimid schism established itself in Egypt 
and carried on secret and open hostilities against the house of ‘Abbas. 
The activities of the Fatimids, however, strengthened the position 


430 



THE DELHI SULTANATE 


of the ‘Abbasids in the eastern lands of Islam where, because the 
Fatimid Caliphs had identified themselves with the Isma‘ili heresy, 
allegiance to the house of ‘Abbas came to be identified with ortho¬ 
doxy. The Sultans of Delhi recognized the suzerainty of the 
‘Abbasid Caliphs. Their names were read in the khutbah and found 
mention on the coinage. Even when the Mongols put an end to the 
Caliphate of Baghdad by executing Musta‘sim-billah, and the Muslim 
world was left without a Caliph, the khutbah and the coinage both 
continued to mention vaguely the leader of the Muslims, and the 
Sultans styled themselves his lieutenants. The only exception was 
Qutb-ud-din Mubarak Shah who claimed the Caliphate for himself . 5 
There is some inconclusive and controversial evidence to show that 
his father, ‘Ala-ud-din Khalji, also was styled a Caliph . 6 Muham¬ 
mad bin Tughluq established relations with the ‘Abbasid Caliphs of 
Egypt, who had been set up by the Mamluks after the downfall and 
dispersal of the ‘Abbasids at Baghdad . 7 The rise of the Mongol power, 
however, dealt a great blow to the claims of the ‘Abbasids. 

The Mongols destroyed the Caliphate of Baghdad, and when 
they themselves were converted to Islam they favoured the theory 
that every independent Muslim empire constituted a Caliphate by 
itself. The theory was not new; it had sustained the Western Cali¬ 
phate; it was the basis of the claims of Qutb-ud-din Mubarak Shah 
and possibly also of his father. But with these exceptions it did not 
find favour at Delhi until a descendant of Chingiz Khan, Babur, the 
first of the Indian Mughuls, established an empire in India. 

The position of the Caliph is generally misunderstood by non- 
Muslims. Muslim jurists as well as thinkers like Ibn Khaldun em¬ 
phasize that the Caliphate is a canonical necessity and, therefore, 
allegiance to a Caliph is demanded by the law of Islam . 8 This reli¬ 
gious character of the institution and its occasional divorce from 
political authority has sometimes created the misconception that the 
Caliph is an arch-priest, resembling the Pope. The parallel is mis¬ 
leading and erroneous. As there is no priesthood in Islam, there 
can be no arch-priest. The Muslims, as an organized community, 
have certain functions and responsibilities which have been 
defined by Shar c , the law of Islam. The basis of these respon¬ 
sibilities is canonical and hence it is a religious duty to discharge 
them. Yet all of them are not strictly of a religious character and 
some of them are social and political. The main purpose of organiz¬ 
ing the Muslims into a well-knit group is to create the environment 
which is necessary to cultivate a religious and normal life. It is, 
however, obvious that the creation of the proper environment in¬ 
cludes a large number of secular activities; indeed the very orga- 


440 


ISLAMIC POLITICAL THEORY 


nization of the Muslims into an independent and sovereign group is 
a political concept. The maintenance of the independence and 
sovereignty of the group is political activity. This function the com¬ 
munity discharges through its elected leader, the Caliph . 9 The 
Caliphate, therefore, is a political institution so far as its functions 
are concerned, though its basis and sanction are canonical. 

There is another aspect of the Caliphate which explains its 
nature. One of the main functions of the organized Muslim com¬ 
munity, according to the jurists, is “to enjoin the ordained and to 
prevent the forbidden,” or, in other words, the encouragement of 
virtue, both positive and negative. The Muslim code of ethics and 
gGod life is enshrined in Muslim Law or the Shar ‘. It is the duty of 
the community to enforce the law. This function also can be per¬ 
formed through an organ which has, at its command, the coercive 
power of the State. The enforcement of the law, therefore, is one 
of the primary functions of the Muslim State which was organized 
in the form of the Caliphate. The enforcement of law is a recog¬ 
nized function of all States, but in a Muslim State, the law being 
based on revealed principles and injunctions contained in the Qur’an, 
it has a divine origin and possesses a sacred character. Therefore, its 
maintenance is a religious duty. Once again, then, the Caliphate is 
a political institution, but it performs a duty which Muslims consider 
to be essentially religious. As the cohesive principle binding the 
Muslims is religious, and because they have been organized to serve 
the purpose of religion, all their institutions whose primary function 
is to maintain the religious nature of their organization are religious, 
even though their normal activities may be secular in nature. This 
would show that the Caliph was no priest. He might, in his capacity 
as the leader of the community, sometimes, take upon himself the 
duty of leading them in prayers, or he might delegate this duty to 
others, but he was not ordained in any sense of the word, nor did he 
have a privileged position in religion. He was the chief executive 
of a community organized on the basis of religion, and his election 
was a canonical necessity, but he had no religious authority. As 
the enforcer of the law, he had, in all controversial matters, to choose 
the interpretation which appealed to him as the best, but this autho¬ 
rity all lay organs entrusted with similar functions must possess. 
This is the basis of all judge-made law. 

Another principle, inherent in the position of the Caliph as the 
enforcer of the law, is its sovereignty. Being based on revelation, 
the law possessed a divine origin. It was not open to any individual 
to endeavour to alter it or to question its authority. It had to be 
interpreted and reinterpreted with changing conditions, and it was 


441 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 

i 

naturally expanded in the process of being applied to diverse and 
complex conditions of life. In this process, principles of jurispru¬ 
dence were borrowed and sometimes invented, but the authority of 
the fundamentals and even of interpretation on which unanimity 
had been achieved was never questioned. The Caliph, therefore, 
was subservient to the law. The Shar‘ was the sovereign; the 
Caliph was its servant and minister . 10 In all societies organized on 
secular basis, the law is the will of the sovereign; in Muslim society 
the sovereignty of the law was the primary principle. The Caliph, 
however, enjoyed great prestige as the chief enforcer of the Shar c . 
Throughout the Middle Ages, so great was the prestige of the Cali¬ 
phate that no potentate, however mighty, considered himself lawful¬ 
ly enthroned without the permission of the Caliph, who found it 
politic to vest authority in rulers and their successors so long as they 
were true to their allegiance . 11 

Philosophic justification for the canonical position was not long 
in coming. Indeed, at times it caught popular imagination to such 
an extent that jurists and thinkers alike considered it necessary to 
point out that whatsoever might be the attitude of philosophy the 
real sanction for the Caliphate was canonical. Their motive was 
sound; philosophical concepts change, but canonical law is firmly 
rooted in sanction and authority. For this reason, Muslim political 
thinkers seldom ventured beyond the realm of apology and justi¬ 
fication. They never struck a bold path, not even of suggesting 
better methods of organizing the community so that it might dis¬ 
charge its canonical responsibilities more efficiently. Perhaps, with 
more independent thinking, the principles of election and consul¬ 
tation could be translated into more democratic political institutions. 
They had considerable scope for growth among Muslims, whose reli¬ 
gious, social and economic systems would have nurtured demo¬ 
cracy. But it is, perhaps, unjust to expect men to rise above their 
environment. 

The line which political philosophers generally took in Medieval 
Islam was briefly this. The human mind finds itself in a state of 
conflict. On the one hand, man is a social animal, and human life 
can find fulfilment only in organized society. He, therefore, 
endeavours to build up and maintain social and political institutions. 
On the other hand, he is also swayed by purely selfish motives. 
There is something perverse in him that leads him to undermine 
the very institutions he has built, whenever he can thereby serve 
his own interests better. This conflict is eternal and is based on 
'two fundamental needs of humanity, which can be described as 
social and individual. As both the needs are real, and human life 


442 


ISLAMIC POLITICAL THEORY 


would become impossible if either of them is neglected, it is neces¬ 
sary to bring about a proportion between them. But, what is the 
proper method of adjusting the two to the benefit of humanity? 
Left to themselves men would not be able to bring about a proper 
adjustment between the two; hence an arbitrator is required. This 
arbitrator is the law revealed by God through His chosen servants . 12 
Certain perverse men, for reasons of selfishness, and others, because 
of ignorance, v/ould not obey the law; hence it is necessary to have 
one who would punish the criminals and lead the ignorant on the 
path of rectitude. Without such an enforcement of the law, social 
life w T ould be impossible. Hence the Muslim philosophers share 
with many others the dread of anarchy. They did not believe, as 
Rousseau did, in the existence of a free and happy society prior to 
the organization of the State. The nearest approach to Rousseau’s 
idea is found in the passage by Ghazzali where he speaks of the 
cities of the world living in a state of heavenly bliss before they 
were reduced to unwilling obedience and bondage by tyrants and 
wicked monarchs; but here he is hardly thinking of pre-political 
society . 13 The Muslim philosophers consider it impossible for a 
man to be happy in a state of anarchy. Rousseau’s hypothetical 
state of nature does not find favour with them. 

The dread of anarchy led the Muslim philosophers to emphasize 
the importance of the monarch. Ghazzali thinks of the State as a 
living organism and compares it to the human body. 13a In working 
out the details of the analogy he calls the monarch the heart of 
the system . 14 His existence is the primary necessity of social life, 
for without a ruler to guide the affairs of mankind, all order would 
vanish and the very existence of the human race would be en¬ 
dangered . 15 It is he whose sword cleanses the world of anarchy 
as well as of evil. Very great is his responsibility, for he will be 
questioned on the Day of Judgment regarding the condition of his 
people and about all acts of justice and injustice committed by him . 16 
Great too is the reward awaiting the just monarch, for he will find 
a place under the banner of the Prophet on the Day of Reckoning . 17 
Later writers, in spite of the protests of the jurists, insisted that 
the righteous monarch was ‘the Vicegerent of God and His Shadow 
on the earth ’. 18 This emphasis on the importance of the monarch’s 
position was greatly exaggerated by writers attached to the Mongol 
courts, and they, like Abu-’l~Faz!, evolved a theory of the righteous 
monarch being chosen by God and, as such, playing the role of the 
ideal philosopher king of the Greeks . 19 Such idealization of the 
monarch could not permit the growth of a philosophy demanding 
any popular share in ordering the affairs of the realm. The thinkers, 
who so eulogized the kingly office, thought that they had done their 


443 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


duty when they had pointed out to the monarchs their heavy 
responsibilities and painted the degradation of irresponsible and 
wicked monarchs in hues borrowed from the abysmal fire. 20 

How did the Sultan of Delhi fit into this picture? He owned 
a nominal allegiance to the Caliph, but, for all practical purposes, 
he was an independent ruler. The Caliph would have found it im¬ 
possible, except by stirring up rebellion, to bring the Sultans of 
Delhi under effective control. This was not the first time that such 
a situation had arisen; there had been rulers, other than the Sultans 
of Delhi, who could not be dislodged by the Caliphs if they wanted 
to do so. The jurists had legalized such a position by classifying 
governorship into three categories. The first of these was the ordi¬ 
nary governorship with limited powers where the authority dele¬ 
gated was carefully defined. The second was governorship with 
unlimited powers where all authority was handed over to the in¬ 
cumbent. The third was governorship by usurpation; such governors 
enjoyed the same authorities as the governors of the second cate¬ 
gory; the difference was in the method of their appointment. 
Governors by usurpation were potentates who had won dominions 
by their swords, and there was no alternative to giving them recog¬ 
nition. 21 The governors of the last two categories were required 
to rule in accordance with the law of Islam, to recognize the Caliph 
as their suzerain and to co-operate with him in defending the lands 
of Islam if required to do so. In their own dominions they were 
independent of any external control. 

II. ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION OF THE SULTANATE 

Inside his dominions the Sultan enjoyed the same authority and 
performed the same functions as the Caliph in his Caliphate. In 
this matter law and philosophy both recognized him to be the repre¬ 
sentative of the Caliph; in so far as the Sultan was vested with 
the powers of the Caliph, he had to perform the duties of the Caliph. 
Indeed the law did not distinguish between the two beyond the 
recognition of the inferior position of the Sultan and his duty to 
co-operate with the Caliph, and, for that, with other Muslim rulers 
in defending the frontiers of Islam. Hence all that has been 
hitherto said regarding the Caliph in connection with his prestige 
and duties applies also to the Sultan. 22 Philosophy also accords him 
the same recognition. 

a. The Sultan’s functions 

The Muslim jurists assign the following functions to the 
Sultan:— 

1. To protect the Faith as defined by 

2. to settle disputes between his subjects; 


444 


ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 


3. to defend the territories of Islam, and to keep the highways 
and roads safe for travellers; 

4. to maintain and enforce the criminal code; 

5. to strengthen the frontiers of Muslim territory against 
possible aggresion; 

6. to wage a holy war against those who act in hostility to 
Islam; 

7. to collect rates and taxes; 

8. to apportion the shares of those who deserve an allowance 
from the public treasury; 

9. to appoint officers to help him in his public and legal duties; 
and 

10. to keep in touch with public affairs and the condition of 
the people by personal contact. 23 

These functions, it will be noticed, arise from the Sultan being 
the chief executive officer of the Muslim community within his 
dominions. He had a responsibility towards his non-Muslim sub¬ 
jects as well which was carefully defined by Muslim law. On accept¬ 
ing the suzerainty of the Muslim empire and the payment of taxes, 
the non-Muslim peoples acquired the rights of protection, the main¬ 
tenance of their rites and worship, the observance of their social 
code and the enforcement of their personal law. 24 

The concentration of all executive authority in the hands of a 
single person has led unwary writers into painting the Sultans of 
Delhi as paragons of despotism; in actual practice their authority, 
like all political power, had serious limitations. The first was that 
he was subservient to the Shar‘ and, because he depended for active 
support mainly on Muslim soldiery, any open breach of the Shar 
would have had serious consequences. Besides, he could not interfere 
with the personal law of any group among his subjects, partly 
because of the legal reason that the monarch had no authority to 
do so, and partly because such interference would not be tolerated. 
The Muslims and Hindus alike considered it their duty to rebel 
against a monarch who prevented them from the exercise of their 
duties in the light of their religion. 25 The sovereignty of a single 
individual is a legal myth; every monarch has to depend on the 
active co-operation of a strong group and the passive support of the 
population. The Sultans of Delhi had to rely on the active support 
of the nobles who, for one reason or another, were willing to make 
common cause with them. 26 The monarch had also to ensure the 
co-operation of a fairly large number of ‘ulamd’, the learned theo¬ 
logians and lawyers, because of their influence with the Muslim 
population. Then there were the many public servants in various 


415 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


branches of the administration who put their experience and techni¬ 
cal knowledge at the service of the State. Nor could the ruler 
forget the cultivators of the soil, the Hindu peasants and tribal 
heads. 27 The ultimate force of the State consisted of the Muslim 
fighters who shed their blood for the glory of Islam. No monarch 
has alienated any of these elements with impunity or succeeded in 
his projects without their support. The hostility of the people 
seldom proved fruitless. 28 There is no sanction for unbridled 
tyranny except the timidity of the people, and the Indian populace 
during the Middle Ages was by no means timid or even forebearing; 
on the other hand, the people were mostly warlike, refractory and 
rebellious. Besides, those were the days of dense forests and limited 
means of communication, and the differences between an army and 
an armed rabble was proverbially very small. 

Reference has already been made to the fact that Abu Bakr’s 
election as the first Caliph was taken by the jurists of Islam as a 
precedent to be followed by the community. Two main aspects of 
that election are important. The elders did not even discuss the 
question of relationship to the Prophet, thus proving that considera¬ 
tions of legitimacy did not claim their attention. They also estab¬ 
lished “the principle of free election by the assembled community 
and its confirmation by general homage”. 29 This idea became firmly 
grounded in the minds of Muslim lawyers, and they laid down the 
same rules for the election of the Sultan. The majority of the 
jurists are of opinion that a monarch elected by the most influential 
men at the capital is entitled to the allegiance of the people, but 
they are not unanimous regarding the qualifications of these 
electors 30 The failure to work out a satisfactory method of general 
election resulted in mere logical quibbles about the minimum num¬ 
ber of electors, thus reducing the election to a mere formality. 
Generally the form of an election was maintained by the Sultans 
of Delhi. The nobles and the learned and most influential theo¬ 
logians at the capital agreed upon a candidate and proclaimed him 
the Sultan. Then a formal oath of allegiance was sworn by them 
and, later, by the populace. Of course this was often an election 
only in name, because the candidate had decided the issue by victory 
in battle or by overwhelming force; but it had the advantage of 
being legal and conforming to the wishes of the jurists and the 
people. I should not be forgotten that another force was at work; 
most of the Sultans were Turks and, in spite of their zeal for Islam, 
Turkish and tribal ideas still influenced their minds. The nobles 
did not always take hereditary rights into consideration, for not 
many Sultans were succeeded by their sons; but they did try to 
limit their choice to the ruling house. The changes in the dynasties 


446 


ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 


seem to have been fortunate, proving that they were not made with¬ 
out reasons of State. 

The right to dethrone a monarch is the logical corollary of an 
elective monarchy. Though some jurists hold that an election is 
so holy and binding that the electors could be released from their 
vows only by the sovereign himself, the majority of lawyers believe 
that the monarch could be deposed if he failed to carry out his 
trust. Injustice is considered to be a sufficient cause for dethrone¬ 
ment. All writers agree that a man suffering from mental or physi¬ 
cal disability cannot continue to be a sovereign. Great importance 
is attached to loss of power of judgment and eyesight. 31 The fact 
that a number of Delhi Sultans, mostly incompetent, were removed 
from the throne, shows that the monarch was not considered too 
sacrosanct to be touched if he proved himself useless to the State. 

The Sultans of Delhi maintained great splendour in their courts 
and processions which had a great utilitarian value, for it cap¬ 
tured the imagination of the people and impressed them with the 
majesty of their rulers. When the Sultan rode out in a procession, 
any suppliant could draw his attention by holding up a petition or 
crying aloud for protection. 32 The general audience was the occa¬ 
sion for the persecuted and the needy to claim the Sultan’s protec¬ 
tion. 35 It was in these public darbdrs that the monarch discharged 
the formal duties appertaining to his office. Matters requiring dis¬ 
cussion and deliberation or involving secrecy were dealt with in 
the council chamber where only those officers were admitted whose 
advice was required. 34 The private audience was less exclusive 
and was attended by the greater nobles and officers of the State. 35 
The more important members of the secretariat were also in 
attendance. 36 The bulk of State business w~as transacted here by 
the Sultan. 


b. The Household 

The diversity of the business and the requirements of a specta¬ 
cular ceremonial necessitated the attendance of a large number of 
officials of various ranks. They had to be carefully marshalled, the 
order of their precedence exactly defined, and even the manner of 
their salutation formally prescribed. The dignity of the monarch 
required that everything should work smoothly. All this required 
a big staff of officers, ushers and heralds. Besides, there were the 
Sultan’s bodyguards, his personal attendants, the palace guards, the 
staff required to serve the inmates of the royal palace, and a host 
of other workers. The entire organization was under the wakil-i 
dar who also supervised the payment of the allowances and salaries 


447 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to the Sultan’s personal staff. Almost equal in importance and 
rank was the amdr-i-hdjib who was also styled bdrbak. He was the 
master of ceremonies at the court. He and his assistants, the hdjibs, 
stood between the sovereign and his subjects, and nobody could 
enter the royal presence without being introduced by them. A big 
institution like the imperial household required a large commissariat; 
this was divided into departments called kdrkhdnahs whose tradi¬ 
tional number seems to have been thirty-six. The literal meaning 
of the word kdrkhdnah is a workshop; most of the kdrkhdnahs in 
the royal household were factories to manufacture articles for court 
use. The jam dark hdnah, for instance, turned out the best cloth in 
the empire. Muhammad bin Tughluq employed no less than five 
hundred workers in gold brocade and four thousand weavers of silk, 
who manufactured the cloth required by the household and for 
making the robes of honour which were so profusely bestowed. 37 
The kdrkhdnahs also manufactured arms, engines of war, armour 
and other fighting equipment. Royal stables also were counted 
among the kdrkhdnahs; there was a big organization under the 
akhurbek for breeding and maintaining horses not only for the 
Sultan’s household but also for his army. 38 The kdrkhdnahs catered 
not only to the needs of the royal husehold but also to the require¬ 
ments of the army and various departments of the State. The court 
also was the greatest patron of learning and fine arts and was 
instrumental in promoting culture. 

c. Ministers 

At the head of the civil administration was the zoazir. Under 
certain weak Sultans the wazir enjoyed almost unlimited authority, 
but this was exceptional. Under strong monarchs also he enjoyed 
great authority. The central finance office was his immediate con¬ 
cern, but he was also responsible for the other offices at head¬ 
quarters. 39 He appointed and superintended the civil servants, and 
organized the agency for the collection of the revenue; he also exer¬ 
cised complete control over the various channels of expenditure. 
His assistants examined all the accounts submitted by the various 
departments of the government; it was in his office that the state¬ 
ments were compared, checked and passed. The wazir took mea¬ 
sures—sometimes humiliating and unpleasant—to recover money 
illegally spent by local officials. All the requirements of the military 
department had to be referred finally to him; his office kept ac¬ 
counts, disbursed salaries and allotted assignments. His department 
paid the stipends to deserving scholars and men of learning, and 
distributed doles to the poor and the needy. No branch of public 
administration was outside his purview, and every subject from the 


448 


ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 


mightiest governor to the lowliest peasant in the land had dealings 
with him or his assistants. 40 The wazlr’s department was called the 
diwdn-i-wizdrat, and mainly dealt with finance. He was assisted 
by a na’ib wazir who acted as his general assistant. Next to him 
was the mushrij-i-mumdlik who was the accountant-general for the 
empire. The mustaufi-i-mumdlik was the auditor-general. Origi¬ 
nally the mushrif’s duty was to enter the accounts received from the 
provinces and the various departments, and the mustaujl audit¬ 
ed them. Copies of the statements of accounts were sent to 
the mushrij as well as to the mustaufi and this naturally resulted in 
unnecessary duplication of work, though there was the advantage 
that the accounts were checked by two different authorities. In 
Firuz Shah’s reign, however, the work was redistributed. The 
mushrij began to deal with income and the mustaufi with expen¬ 
diture. The mushrij was assisted by a nazir who supervised, 
through a large staff distributed all over the empire, the collection of 
revenue; he also audited the local accounts. Later a waqiif was add¬ 
ed to assist the mustaufi in the same way as the nazir assisted the 
mushrij 4 ^ 

There were three other main ministries, which, together with 
the dlwdn-i-wizdrat t were compared to four pillars supporting the 
vault of the State. The first of these was the dlwdn-i-risdlat which 
dealt with religious matters, pious foundations, stipends to deserving 
scholars and men of piety. This office was presided over by the 
sadr-us-sudur, who generally was also the qdzi-i-mumalik; in the 
latter capacity he controlled the department of justice. 42 The 
diwan-i-arz v/as the office of the ‘ ariz-i-mumdlik who was the con¬ 
troller-general of the military department. This ministry main¬ 
tained the descriptive rolls of horses and men. The c driz was the 
inspector-general of the forces, and he or his provincial assistants 
enlisted recruits and fixed their pay. 43 The third ministry was the 
diwdn-i-inshd which dealt with State correspondence. It was under 
the dabir-i-khds who was also the confidential clerk of the State. 
All the correspondence, formal or confidential, between the sovereign 
and the rulers of other States or his own tributaries and officials, 
passed through this department which employed a large number 
of dablrs who had already established their reputation as masters 
of style. 44 Another minister was the barid-i-mumalik who was 
the head of the State-news-agency. It was his duty to keep him¬ 
self informed of all that was happening in the empire; ubiquitous 
agents reported all news which had any significance or importance. 
The headquarters of every administrative sub-division had a local 
band who sent regular news-letters to the central office. This sys¬ 
tem assured the obedience of provincial and local officials and pro- 

449 


D.S.—29 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


vided a safeguard against the oppression of the people by local 
bureaucrats. 45 

The ministers were servants of the crown and responsible only 
to him. There was no question of the ministers acting as a team to 
resist the Sultan’s will. They enjoyed their authority in the capa¬ 
city of being experts and heads of well-organized bureaucratic 
departments. Generally a noble was appointed na’ib~ul-mulk or 
‘Lord Lieutenant of the empire’; his authority varied according to the 
character of the emperor. Sometimes it was an empty title; at other 
times it invested the holder with practically absolute authority. He 
was the head of the military organization and was entrusted with the 
government of the centrally administered areas. 46 

d. Finance 

The financial resources of the State were well defined. The 
main source of income was the State demand on agricultural pro¬ 
duce. The methods of assessment were sharing, appraisement or 
measurement; the last was based on a system of schedules of 
average produce for each sub-division to calculate the probable pro¬ 
duce in the area, brought under cultivation by each individual pea¬ 
sant which was measured. 47 The general rate of the State demand 
was a fifth of the gross produce, which was raised to a half under 
‘Ala-ud-din Khaljl. The proportion seems to have been reduced 
again to the original level after his death. Muhamad bin Tughluq 
made an unsuccessful effort to increase the rate of the demand again 
in the Doab. Babur raised the demand to a fourth of the produce, 
and that seems to have been the proportion until Akbar raised it to 
a third. A capitation tax called jizya was levied on the Hindus at 
the rate of ten, twenty or forty tankahs per annum according to the 
wealth of the assessee. 48 Imbecile old men, cripples, blind, and 
those who had not enough to pay the tax after defraying the cost of 
living were excused. Monks and priests, if they did not work to 
earn their living and devoted all their time to worship and devotion, 
were also exempt. 49 Jizya was charged in lieu of military service 
which was, theoretically, compulsory for all Muslims; therefore it 
was not charged from women and children or from government ser¬ 
vants. 150 There is evidence to believe that the cultivators also did 
not pay jizya . 51 The assessment must have been lenient because 
it does not seem to have brought any great income to the State. 52 
The other sources of income were the import duties, the State share 
in spoils of war, the imposts on mines and on treasure-troves if they 
contained coins of pre-Muslim days. The import duties ranged 
from 2\ to 10 per cent, the rate of demand under the other heads 
being a uniform twenty per cent. 153 Muslims paid a poor tax called 


450 


ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 


zakdt and were sometimes given the privilege of paying a tenth of 
the gross produce instead of the usual demand on the land which 
they possessed. 54 This, however, was a rare privilege. 55 

e. Assignment and Valuation 

The State, for the sake of convenience, often assigned the 
revenue of an area to an official instead of paying his salary in cash. 60 
This system required a careful valuation of the different areas so that 
the State might know the figures of estimated average produce. This 
was possible by maintaining schedules of average produce based on 
the figures of previous years. The system of paying salaries in the 
shape of assignments of revenue has led some writers to confuse it 
with feudalism; actually it was only a method of payment and did not 
confer any permanent rights to the assignee, whose assignment could 
be resumed or exchanged for another assignment by the State, which, 
during the Sultanate period, also kept its administration in its own 
hands. No assignment was permanent or hereditary. 57 Assign¬ 
ment and valuation provided the medieval equivalent of a modern 
budget, and the State, as a further safeguard, sometimes earmarked 
certain sources of income for specified purposes. 68 

f. The Army 

The army was administered by the ‘driz-i-mumalik whose duty 
was to keep up the strength and the efficiency of the forces and to 
provide equipment, horses and rations. 59 His office maintained the 
descriptive roll of each soldier; ‘Ala-ud-din Khalji introduced the 
system of branding horses. 60 The army was posted on the frontiers, 
in places of strategic importance, and also at such centres from which 
it could be easily moved to deal with rebellion or disturbances. 61 
The main army was the cavalry to which the utmost importance was 
attached; it w T as the lack of good cavalry in the armies of the Hindu 
rajas which resulted in their defeat and subjugation. Elephants also 
played an important part in the army of the Sultans. The Sultanate 
also maintained infantry which, however, played only a secondary 
part. The use of fire-arms was known, at least since the days of 
‘Ala-ud-din Khalji; 62 a corps of engineers was maintained to act as 
sappers and miners and to man the various siege engines known to 
the medieval world. 63 Every army had a corps of well-trained 
scouts and a unit of surgeons and ambulance. 64 Forts played an 
important part in the strategy of defence. State granaries and 
banjdras kept the army well stocked with provisions. 65 The battle 
array was simple; troops were divided into the centre, the two wings, 
two flanking parties, the vanguard, and the rearguard. In front 


451 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


stood elephants protected by iron plates, with towers on their backs 
carrying warriors and archers. The elephants were preceded by 
four lines of infantry and archers with gaps for the cavalry to ride 
out and give battle to the enemy. 66 It was considered politic to pre¬ 
vent the predominance of any single race in the army, and therefore 
the army of the Sultanate had Turks, Afghans, Persians, Mongols 
and Indians. 67 Hindu soldiers joined Muslim armies in large 
numbers since the days of Mahmud of Ghazni. Hindu soldiers help¬ 
ed Qutb-ud-din Aibak in his conquests. Throughout the history of 
the Sultanate they were employed in large numbers in various capa¬ 
cities in the army. 68 The army was organised on decimal basis, 
though later we hear of units of 50 and 150 as well. 69 

g. Social Services 

The department of religious affairs was under the sadr-us-sudur. 
It maintained the mosques and provided imams and preachers with 
stipends or grants in land. It also subsidized the educational system 
by giving grants to deserving scholars and teachers. 70 

Educational institutions were mostly founded by pious donors 
who left large endowments for their maintenance. Monarchs, 
nobles and traders vied with one another in promoting education, 
and the State helped the effort by its patronage of learning and 
scholarship. The result was that the colleges of India in those days 
were repositories of all that was best in the arts and sciences of the 
Middle Ages; the Sultanate of Delhi was the preserver of all that 
was left of Islamic culture and learning in the East after the Mongol 
cataclysm. Khusrav speaks highly of learning among the Hindus, 
particularly of their knowledge of science, mathematics and yoga. 11 
Hindu genius, sometimes under the patronage of Muslim rulers, 
sometimes quite independently, blossomed forth in a renaissance of 
literary and religious activity. The greatest contribution of the 
Muslim rulers was the encouragement of the contemporary verna¬ 
cular languages which broke the artificial barriers created by the 
insistence on Sanskrit as the medium of expression, and opened the 
flood-gates of literary and religious activity. Muslim poets and 
thinkers sometimes adopted the local languages for expressing their 
emotions and thoughts; Malik Muhammad JayasI is an outstanding 
example, and his Padumavati is still considered to be a classic in 
Hindi poetry. The royal court also patronized painting, music and 
architecture. 72 There also existed a number of hospitals in the 
capital as well as in other large cities. 73 The Sultans also disbursed 
large sums of money to the poor. 74 


452 


ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 


h. Provincial and local government 

The empire was divided into a number of provinces and tribu¬ 
tary states. The latter were free to manage their affairs so long as 
they did nothing prejudicial to the safety of the empire. They were 
particularly required to protect imperial officials and Muslims resi¬ 
dent in their territories and to maintain good standards of adminis¬ 
tration. It has already been mentioned that jurists classified gover¬ 
norships into two categories: those with limited powers and those 
with unlimited powers. For geographical reasons the Sultans gave 
unlimited powers to the governors of Bengal who were treated as 
semi-dependent monarchs. They were required to own allegiance to 
the Sultan of Delhi and to send him tribute, mostly in the shape of 
elephants. They were also expected to maintain good standards of 
administration, but they were left practically independent to manage 
their affairs. When the Sultanate was weak, sometimes even the 
formal allegiance was withheld. Other governors were under full 
control and their powers were well defined. A governor was the 
head of the provincial government and its chief executive officer; but 
his power was kept in check by the presence of the deputies of the 
central government in all the departments of provincial administra¬ 
tion, which was a replica of the organization at the centre. All the 
ministries at the capital had control over the corresponding depart¬ 
ments in the province. The governor’s military power was kept in 
check by the fact that the provincial military department was under 
the local c driz who was responsible to the c driz-i-mumdlih at the 
centre. 75 The organization of provincial administration was the 
same in Bengal, the only difference being that the provincial depart¬ 
ments were not under the supervision of the central government. 

i. Sub-divisions 

With the growth and development of the provincial administra¬ 
tion it was found necessary to divide the provinces into shiqqs which 
were put under shiqqddr s. 7 6 When the empire decayed and provin¬ 
cial dynasties were established, the shiqq emerged as a sarkdr , and 
the officer in charge of a sarkdr was called shiqqddr-i-shiqqdardn or 
the chief shiqqddr. The reason was that the shiqqddr had sunk to 
the position of a parganah official. The parganah was an important 
administrative unit, because it was here that the government came 
into direct contact with the peasant. The main officials were an 
‘arnil, later called a shiqqddr, a mushrif also known as amm or 
munsif, a treasurer, two kdrkuns and a qanungo. The ‘dmil was the 
chief executive officer and the head of the parganah administration. 
The mushrif was the chief assessment officer; the fact that he was 
also called amin (an honest repository of a trust) and munsif (a just 


453 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


judge) throws a great deal of light on the ideals of agrarian adminis¬ 
tration of the Sultanate, because the munsij was appointed to ad¬ 
judicate justly between the State and the peasant. The revenue 
was deposited with the treasurer. The karkuns were the registrars 
of the parganah; one of them maintained the books in Persian and 
the other in Hindi, hence one was called Fdrsi-nawls and the other 
Hindwi-nawis. The qdnunffo maintained the previous records of 
produce and assessment. 77 In addition to these, certain authorities 
mention a choudhrl who was appointed to represent the peasants 
and keep the administration informed of their condition and 
demands. 78 The village was the basic unit of administration. It 
was permitted to maintain its traditions of self-government. The 
Government, in permitting the village to enjoy the privilege of 
managing its own affairs, entrusted it with the responsibility of 
maintaining peace in the area under its control. The village dealt 
with the administration through its headman, and maintained an 
accountant, called patwari, to keep its records of cultivation, pro¬ 
duce, assessment and payment of the State demand. 79 The State, 
while welcoming and encouraging the co-operation of the headman, 
used circumspection in defining his relations with the villagers, be¬ 
cause headmen and influential sections of the village often tried to 
make the weaker peasants pay their share. ‘Ala-ud-dln Khalji gave 
strict orders that the villages should never be assessed as a whole, 
and that “the strong should not be allowed to shift their burden on 
the weak.” 80 The headmen, some of whom were hereditary, were 
given a small percentage on the revenue which they had helped in 
realizing. 81 The revenue administration had a large percentage of 
Hindu personnel, particularly in the local sub-divisions, because they 
possessed the necessary experience and knowledge of rural condi¬ 
tions. 82 


j. Means of communication 

In order to maintain regular and speedy communication between 
the different parts of the empire a regular postal system was organiz¬ 
ed. Ibn Batutah gives the following account of it from his personal 
experience: 

“In India the post is of two kinds. The horse-post called ulaq 
is run by the royal horses stationed at a distance of every four miles. 
The foot-post has three stations per mile; it is called dawa, that is 
to say, one-third of a mile. The mile (mil) is known among the 
Indians as kuroh. Now, at every third of a mile there is a well- 
populated village, outside which are three pavilions in which sit 
men with girded loins ready to start. Each carries a rod, two 
cubits in length with copper bells at the top. When the courier 


454 


ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 


starts from the city he holds the letter in one hand and the rod with 
its bells in the other; and he runs as fast as he can. When the men 
in the pavilion hear the ringing of the bells they get ready. As 
soon as the courier reaches them, one of them takes the letter from 
his hand and runs at top speed shaking the rod all the while until 
he reaches the next ddwa. And the same process continues till 
the letter reaches its destination. This foot-post is quicker than the 
horse-post; and often it is used to transport the fruits of Khurasan 
which are much desired in India. Placed in secure baskets the 
fruits are carried by the couriers who run at top speed till they 
reach the sultan. In the same way notorious criminals are trans¬ 
ported. Each is placed on a frame of wood and is carried on their 
heads by the couriers who go at full speed. Similarly, water 
for the sultan’s use is carried from the Ganges to Daulatabad 
when he resides there. The Ganges is the river to which the Hindus 
make their pilgrimage. It lies at a distance of forty days’ jour¬ 
ney from Daulatabad. When the news officers write and despatch 
the news of the new arrivals in the country to the sultan, they write 
out the news in full and vigorously, telling him the physical fea¬ 
tures, the garment, the number of the companions, servants and 
slaves and horses of the new-comer; they communicate further how 
he behaves on the march and at rest and his whole conduct, leaving 
out no pertinent detail whatever. When the new-comer reaches 
Multan, the capital of the province of Sind, he stops there till the 
issue of the royal orders for his coming and entertainment. There 
every person is honoured according to his deeds and conduct and 
ambition, no recognition whatever being made of his descent and 
parentage. ” 82a 

Elsewhere Ibn Batutah informs us that some time the postal 
superintendent ( malik-ul-bcind ) also acted as news-writer. In Mul¬ 
tan, for example, the former “used to write the news of that city and 
its dependencies to the sultan—the news concerning all its events 
and arrivals.” 82b 

k. Hindu Chiefs 

No description of the administrative organization of the Sulta¬ 
nate would be complete without the discussion of the power and in¬ 
fluence of the Hindu chiefs. A large number of powerful hereditary 
lords existed under the Gurjara-Pratlharas of Kanauj whose sway 
extended from the Himalayas to the Narmada. 83 These local chief¬ 
tains had been left much to themselves by the Rajput rulers. The 
tributaries had never been particularly amenable to control; their 
intransigence had, in places, been sanctified by tradition and a 
strange sense of honour; for instance, the Mawassi and Girassi chiefs 


455 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


in Gujarat “felt themselves bound in honour to withhold tribute till 
a body of soldiers appeared against them even under the British 
Government”. 84 The chiefs were mostly left in possession of their 
estates by the Muslim rulers. They were, however, almost always 
ready to withhold tribute and to create trouble; the slightest weaken¬ 
ing of the Government being a signal for revolt. The Sultans, 
however, succeeded in bringing them under control, partly by vio¬ 
lence, and partly by conciliation. Those who submitted were treat¬ 
ed generously and sometimes advanced to positions of responsibility 
and authority. 86 As they were not, except in extreme cases of 
rebellion, deprived of their domains, their potential power seldom 
decreased. The smaller chieftains were employed by the State to 
help the officials in the realization of the revenue. The khuts and 
the muqaddams, as these smaller chieftains were called, played an 
important part in the rural administration of the empire. 853 

III. LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS 

It has already been mentioned that Muslim polity was based 
on the conception of the legal sovereignty of the Shar‘ or Islamic 
law. No one was above the law, and all—the monarch and the 
subject alike—were subservient to it. This was so universally re¬ 
cognized that there are cases on record in which subjects have 
sued monarchs in ordinary courts of law. 86 The Shar‘ is based on 
the principles enunciated by the Qur’an and is composed of three 
important elements:— 

(i) The Qur’an; a clear injunction of the Holy Book has an 
over-riding authority on every other factor. 

(ii) The hadls or the traditions of the prophet. The Muslims 
hold that the Prophet was the best interpreter of the revelation 
contained in the Qur’an and, therefore, his sayings and actions are 
considered to be of vital importance. Muslim scholars have deve¬ 
loped an entire science of sifting trustworthy traditions from those 
which are considered to be forged or unreliable. Any tradition 
which has been reported by unreliable narrators, or is not in 
consonance with the principles enunciated in the Qur’an or with 
reliable traditions, is rejected. After careful research scholars have 
agreed upon a body of traditions which are generally held to be 
authentic. These traditions have played an important part in the 
development of the Shar‘, because wherever the Qur’an does not 
contain a clear injunction, the help of the hadts is invariably sought. 

(iii) Jjmaf or consensus of opinion. Wherever legal opinion 
is unanimous regarding the interpretation of a verse of the Qur’an 
or a tradition of the Prophet, it is generally not considered safe 


456 


LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS 


to differ. Unless the judge has very strong reasons to differ from 
an interpretation which has received universal approbation, he is 
expected to concur. 

It is apparent from this discussion that interpretation plays an 
important part in the development of the 8har‘ . Like any other 
system of law, the Shar‘ has always possessed a considerable amount 
of judge-made law, because in applying the principles of the Qur’an 
and the teachings of the Prophet to the complex need of a growing 
society, the lawyers and the judges had to interpret and reinter¬ 
pret them. In this way there grew up several well-defined schools 
of law in Islam, each with its own characteristics. Some of them 
were fundamentalists, others rationalists in varying degrees. The 
ShVah and Khdriji sects were founded as the result of political 
cleavage, but they developed their own schools of law. Orthodox 
Islam, generally called Sunnism, evolved four main schools of law, 
Hanbali, MalikI, Shafii, and Hanafi. Of these, the last two attained 
greater popularity. The first two are more fundamentalist and the 
Hanafi school gives greater importance to rational deduction than 
any other school. The four schools are called after their founders, 
all jurists of great eminence. The Hanafi school was greatly 
strengthened by the two immediate disciples of Imam Abu Hanlfah, 
one of whom, Imam Abu Yusuf, has left an important treatise on 
the law governing the State demand on agricultural produce and 
agrarian administration. 87 It was this school which had the largest 
following in India and the State was also guided by this system. 8S 
It may also be mentioned that the Hanafi school had the most 
liberal attitude towards non-Muslim inhabitants of a Muslim 
Empire. 89 

a. Law applying to the Non-Muslims 

The Shar ( recognized three broad principles regarding the res¬ 
ponsibility of non-Muslim residents in a Muslim State. They, by 
acknowledging the authority of a Muslim State, had not undertaken 
to give it active support; they could, therefore, discharge their 
responsibility by refraining from rebellion and paying a tax, called 
jizya. If they did render active support by joining the army or 
the civil service of the State, the individuals, co-operating in this 
manner, would be exempt from the tax. 89a Then, the personal law 
of Islam, or those portions of the Shar c which laid down duties of 
a religious nature for the Muslims, would not apply to them; under 
this head also came zakat, the poor-tax which every Muslim should 
pay. Thirdly the zimmi, as the protected and allied peoples were 
called, would be free to maintain their institutions, their forms of 
worship, 8915 their personal law and, if they so desired, their own 


457 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


organs to impose their personal law. It was, however, open to a 
zimmi to go to a Muslim court, if he expected to secure better 
justice there. In all cases where the litigants differed in religion, the 
case was taken to a Muslim court. When the two litigants belonged 
to the same religion, the court applied their personal law, and when 
the litigants happened to be non-Muslims, the court took the advice 
of men learned in that law. Wherever the litigants belonged to 
two different religions, even if one of them was a Muslim, the courts 
decided the cases on principles of equity. The Muslim State was, 
however, faced with one difficulty: it had to have a criminal code 
which could be applied universally. This difficulty was solved by 
Muslim jurists before the conquest of any part of India. They laid 
down that the Islamic criminal code was to be applied, but where 
it came into conflict with the moral notions of the zimmis, it should 
not apply to them, if such a procedure could be adopted without 
danger to the State or society. For instance, suicide was an offence, 
but the Muslims tolerated suicide by non-Muslims for religious pur¬ 
poses like satl, provided that it was not the result of coercion and 
previous permission of the government had been obtained . 90 It was 
also laid down as a principle that the punishment of criminal offence 
should be lighter for the zimmis, because it was not fair to expect 
them to have the same respect for the Islamic code as the Muslims 
had. It may be pointed out that the Islamic code was much less 
severe than any other code which had currency in that age. 90a 

b. The Laiv Courts 

The Sultan, as the enforcer of the law and the head of the 
State, exercised three functions. He was the arbitrator in the dis¬ 
putes of his subjects; he was the head of the bureaucracy; he was 
the commander-in-chief of the forces. In his first capacity he dis¬ 
pensed justice through the diwdn-i-qaza; in his second capacity, 
through the diwun-i-mazdlim; while he himself or his military com¬ 
manders sat as a court-martial to try rebels, though it was consider¬ 
ed necessary to obtain a ruling from qualified lawyers. The 
department dealing with rebels and those charged with high treason 
was later organized into diwdn-i-siydsat consisting of lawyers and 
inquirers into questions of fact . 91 Finally, the accused were pro¬ 
duced before the monarch, who heard the prosecution and the de¬ 
fence and, after consulting legal opinion, gave his decision. It was 
the monarch’s sole prerogative to order the execution of a criminal, 
and capital punishment could not be awarded without reference to 
him. Cases of capital punishment recommended by other courts 
were also referred to this department. Cases of complaint against 
any official of the State were heard in the mazdlim court. The mo- 


458 


LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS 


narch generally sat twice a week as a mazdlim court and was advised 
by the chief qdzl - 92 In the provinces, the governor, the dlwdn and 
the provincial qdzl constituted the provincial mazdlim court. 

The ordinary civil and criminal litigations were the charge of 
the qdzi-i-mumdlik , who had his deputies in the provincial capitals 
and a qdzl in each town of any considerable size. The chief qdzl 
was an official of great prestige and was chosen for his learning as 
well as piety. The qazl } s function was to find out facts and apply 
the law. He was responsible neither for summoning or bringing the 
accused or the witnesses to the court, nor for the execution of his 
decrees . 93 These functions were performed by another branch of 
the department of justice which was under the amir dad who also 
had deputies in the provinces and a dddbek each in towns where 
qdzls were posted . 94 The kotwdls, who were the heads of the police 
organization in every city, discharged the duties of courts of first 
inquiry in criminal cases . 95 The muhtasib was also connected with 
justice because he inquired into all open breaches of the law which 
did not come under the cognizance of the law courts and awarded 
the punishment if the guilt was not denied. If the accused denied 
the guilt, the matter was referred to a qazl’s court. The kotwal 
was responsible for the maintenance of public utilities, control of 
markets, and prevention of nuisance, and discharged many duties 
now performed by a municipal committee or the police . 96 The 
system of appeals from a lower court to a higher court existed . 97 
The monarch did not interfere with the duties of the qdzls whose 
independence was respected; he, however, could dismiss any qdzl 
who was found unworthy of his charge. In the villages and caste 
or guild brotherhood, the panchdyats worked successfully.

APPENDIX 


THE USE OF GUNS IN MEDIEVAL INDIA 

It has been urged that the gunpowder and cannon were known 
and used in India during the reign of Iltutmish (A.D. 1210-36). 1 
This view is based on the mention of kushk-anjir, as a weapon of 
war, in Adab-ul-harab was-shajdat , composed by Fakhr-i-Mudabbir 

at the beginning of the thirteenth century and dedicated to Sultan 
Iltutmish. A later work, Farhang-i Sharjndmd-i Ahmed Munyari, 
compiled in 864-79 A.H. (A.D. 1459-1474), says that ‘kushk-anjir’ 
means ‘perforator’ or an instrument ‘for throwing stones’, or a ‘stone 
or ball projected by the expansive force of combustible substances’ 
(ddriihd-i-atishin). This evidence, however, cannot be regarded as 
conclusive. For, without any independent corroborative evidence, 
we cannot attribute to kushk-anjir a sense or significance in the 
thirteenth century which was attached to it in the fifteenth, when 
guns were familiar instruments of war. 

A. Z. Nadvi has quoted extracts from Ziya-ud-dm Barani’s 
Tdrlkh-i-Flruz Shdhl to show that during the siege of Ranthambhor 
in 699 A.H. (A.D. 1299-1300) sang-i-maghribl was violently gushing 
out from the fort and a stone fell upon Nusrat Khan, who was 
severely wounded. He argues that sang-i-maghribl means western 
stone and refers to cannon. 2 Firishta, however, takes it to mean 
a stone thrown by manjanlq, Nadvi argues that ‘if it were so, then 
why did Barani use a different word from manjanlq with the name 
and use of which he was quite familiar’. He further points out 
that Muhammad bin ‘Umar Makki, who lived long in Arabia, took 
sang-i-maghribl in the sense of a stone cannon-ball, and that 
Tabaqdt-i-Bahddur Shdhl, written in the sixteenth century A.D., re¬ 
fers distinctly to cannon in the time of ‘Ala-ud-dm Khalji; one of 
these cannons was so heavy that it was drawn by 100 bullocks. But 
these arguments cannot be regarded as very convincing. 

We have definite evidence of the use of artillery in India in 
the fourteenth century A.D. Nadvi interprets a passage in Firishta 
to mean that the Raia of Vijayanagara brought several hundred 
cannon in the battlefield against Muhammad Shah Bahmani. 3 
Firishta says, on the authority of Tuhfat-ul-Muslirriin ( Tuhfat-us- 
salayln according to Briggs), that in this battle which was fought 
in 767 A.H. (A.D. 1365-6), the Bahmani king secured as war booty 
thirty hundred cannon (three hundred gun-carriages according to 
Briggs). Immediately after stating this Firishta says that shortly 
after this battle “the Bahmani king collected a train of artillery 
which had never till then been employed by the Muslims in the 
Deccan; he gave the command to Mookurrib Khan, son of Sufdur 
Khan Seestany, attaching to him a number of Toorks and Europeans 
acquainted with the art of gunnery”. 4 Firishta informs us that 
in the next battle with Vijayanagara, about eight months later, 
Muqurrab Khan used his artillery with great effect. Henceforth 
the artillery formed an important weapon in the wars of the Deccan.

USE OF GUNS 


There is no doubt that guns were in common use before the 
arrival of the Portuguese in India in A.D. 1498. Faria-e-Souza 
writes: “The Moors of Sumatra, Malacca, and the Moluccoes (those 
princes bearing the title of Moolk, that is, the several kings of the 
Deccan) were well disciplined and much better stored with artillery 
than we that attacked them in A.D. 1508”. 15 

Mahmud Begarha used artillery in naval battles. Bahadur Shah 
(Gujarat) made a collection of cannon of various designs. He em¬ 
ployed a Portuguese Muslim convert and a Turk called RumI Khan, 
who were great experts in the manufacture of cannon. RumI Khan 
had brought with him a big cannon known as Egyptian cannon. It 
is said that it w T as drawn by 300 men and innumerable buffaloes. 
It was made in Egypt in 937 A.H. (A.D. 1530). 6 Nadvi also cites 
many other instances of the use of guns in India before Babur 
employed them in the first battle of Panipat in A.D. 1526. 7 Babur 
says that the soldiers in Bengal were expert artillerists. 8

ISLAMIC POLITICAL THEORY 


89b. Under the Islamic law, twenty conditions, some of which were most humi¬ 
liating, were imposed on the Zimmls. These are given in detail by Shaikh 
Hamadam in Zakhirat-ul-Muluk, folios 94a-95a. Some of these conditions will 
be referred to in Chapter XVII C. These conditions were laid down by the 
Caliph ‘Umar and therefore go back to the beginnings of Islam. If the Zimmis 
infringed any of these conditions “they shall not enjoy security and it shall 
be lawful for Muslims to take their lives and possessions.” For an English 
translation of the passage, cf. Sources of Indian Tradition (Columbia Univer¬ 
sity Press, 1958), 490. All the Hindus were treated as Zimmis. That the 
Muslim rulers of India did not tolerate Hindu religious institutions and made 
it a regular practice to break idols and demolish temples (often raising mos¬ 
ques in their places) has been shown in the preceding chapters and also in 
Ch. XVII C. (Ed.). 

90. BaranI, 497. IBH, 21. 

90a- This is not supported by the barbarous practices such as burning alive a 
Brahmana referred to above on p. 104, which was declared to be in strict 
accordance with Islamic law. Ibn Batutah tells a gruesome story of a woman 
being put to an ordeal by water which he himself witnessed. The test pre¬ 
scribed by the ndib-us-sultan to determine her guilt was this: “Four pitchers 
were filled with water and tied to the hands and feet of the woman who was 
then thrown into the Jamna (Jim). But she did not drown, whereby it was 

proved that she was a kaftar . The naib-us-sultan then ordered her to 

to be burnt” (IBH, 165). (Ed.). 

This, as well as the most barbarous methods of punishment inflicted on 
the criminals as indicated above (pp. 83 , 84, 98), including mutilation, wit¬ 
nessed by Ibn Batutah, (IBH, 152), give us a realistic idea of the “medieval 
barbarism” that prevailed, or continued from old times, in spite of laws and 
institutions conceived on a high standard. (Ed.).

CHAPTER XV 

LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE 

A. SANSKRIT 

I. INTRODUCTION 

The same features that characterized the preceding period 
continue to operate during this age also. 1 Political conditions did 
not materially affect Sanskrit literature, and despite growing 
Muslim domination in parts of the country literary works continued 
to be produced. The creative period, however, had long been a 
matter of the past, there being little of intrinsic merit, though the 
production is immense and almost every branch of literature is re¬ 
presented. There is no originality. Works seem to be produced 
only for the learned; there is no contact with the masses. This 
period shows a growing tendency among the authors to write school 
texts. 

Considering that there was a close contact with the Muslims 
for several centuries it is rather strange that no influence of such 
contact is to be seen in the vast Sanskrit literature to any appre¬ 
ciable extent. 

Among the factors influencing Sanskrit literature of this period 
particular mention may be made of the Chaitanya movement of 
Bengal and Orissa which was productive of several works in drama, 
Champu , grammar, and other branches. The patronage extended by 
the Hindu rulers of Vijayanagara, Warangal, Gujarat, etc. resulted 
in the concentration of scholars to these regions and the produc¬ 
tion of standard works in different branches by the authors patro¬ 
nized in these courts. Stories of Rama and Krishna and of the 

• • 

heroes in the Puranas have always been the fountain-heads from 
which the poets and dramatists drew their subject-matter. During 
the period under review stories of Nala and Yayati seem to have 
been the most popular, and a number of works appeared having their 
themes based on the story of the Kddambari. 

The large number of royal authors and patrons of learning forms 
one of the main characteristics of this, as of the preceding age. 
Hammira, Kumbhakarna, Prataparudradeva, Kumaragiri or Vasanta- 
raja, Vemabhupala, Sirhhabhupala, Kataya Verna, Immadi Praudha- 
devaraya, Virupaksha, Saluva Narasirhha, Krishnadevaraya and 
Tippa Bhupala were some of the rulers who enriched Sanskrit lite¬ 
rature in several branches—Kavya, Nataka, poetics, dramaturgy, 
commentaries, music, etc. There were also large number of cele- 


464 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


brated polymaths like Viayaranya, Vamana Bhatta Bana, Venkata- 
natha or Vedanta Desika, and Uddanda who contributed works in 
Kavya, Nataka, Champu, philosophy, etc. Jains made a substantial 
contribution to Sanskrit literature during this period. Regional 
survey indicates that the bulk of production came from the South, 
followed by Bengal, Mithila and Western India. Kashmir recedes 
into the background. 


II. BELLES-LETTERS 

A. KAVYA 
(i) Mahakavya 

The Udararaghava of Sakalyamalla alias Maliacharya or Kavi- 
malla relates the entire Ramdyana story in a highly artificial style. 
Only nine of its eighteen cantos are available. 2 The poet was a 
contemporary of Sihgabhupala (c. A.D. 1330). Agastya, the court- 
poet of Prataparudradeva of Warangal, composed several works, 
among which may be mentioned the Prataparudra-yasobhushana , 3 
Krishna-charita (prose romance), and Balabharata, which summarises 
the whole story of the Mahabharata in 20 cantos, beginning with 
the origin of the Kuru line from the Moon. Coming from a learned 
family of poets, Vidyachakravartin III was the son of Vasudeva 
and grandson of Vidyachakravartin II, the author of Gadya-karnd- 
mrita. He was patronized by the Hoysala king Ballala III. His 
Rukmini-kalyana 4 describes the marriage of Krishna and RukminI 
in 16 cantos, the first giving the genealogy of the Hoysala kings be¬ 
sides a short account of the poet’s family. The extant nine cantos 
of Narakclsura-vijaya by Madhava, a poet at the court of king 
Virupaksha of Vijayanagara, describe the story of the conquest of 
Narakasura by Krishna. Vamana Bhatta Bana, son of Komatiyajvan 
and grandson of Varadagnichit, was a polymath, having composed 
Kavya, drama, bhdna, charita, sandesa, lexicons; etc. His versatility 
brought him the titles Shadbhashavallabha and Kavisarvabhauma. 
Born in the same gotra (i.e. Vatsa) as Bana, he thought he inherited 
his qualities and styled himself Abhinavabhattabana. His Nala- 
bhyudaya in eight cantos and Raghundtha-charita in thirty deal with 
the lives of the respective heroes. He flourished in the fifteenth 
century A.D. 

The Harivilasa of Lolimbaraja narrates the life of Krishna. 5 
The famous Durga festival has been described by Vidyapati in 1000 
verses in Durgtibhakti-tarangini. Ramachandra, son of Lakshmana- 
bhatta, composed in A.D. 1524, Rasikaranjana at Ayodhya which 
describes the erotic and ascetic sentiments at the same time. Of

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


similar nature is the Raghava-Pandava-Yadavlya of Chidambara, 
narrating simultaneously three stories of the RdmdyaV'a, Mahd- 
bharata and Bhdgavata. King Saluva Narasimha is said to have 
composed Rdmdbhyudaya in 24 cantos. 6 Sankara-vijaya by the 
polymath Vidyaranya, who played an important role in the history 
of Vijayanagara, 7 is supposed to contain the biography of the great 
Sankara. Divakara, at the court of Krishnadevaraya of Vijaya¬ 
nagara, wrote Pdrijdtaharana, Devistuti, Rasamanjari, and Bhdratd- 
mrita on the basis of the stories in the Mahabhdrata. Kirtiraja’s 
Nemindtha-mahdkdvya narrates the life of Neminatha in 12 cantos, 
while Dvydsraya-kdvya by Jinaprabha describes the life of Srenika. 
Somakirti wrote Saptavyasana-charita, Pradyumna-charita and 
Yosodhara-charita . Vdsudeva-vijaya by Vasudeva, 8 at the court of 
Manavikrama of Calicut, illustrates the grammatical aphorisms of 
Panini. Adventures of Krishna form the subject of Chaturbhuja’s 
Haricharita-kdvya composed in Bengal. 

Peculiar interest attaches to Kathdkautuka by Srivara, pupil 
of Jonaraja, which is an adaptation in 15 cantos of Yusuf wa Zuleikha 
by Jam! in Persian, and is probably the earliest instance of the 
utilization of Persian literature. Hebrew in origin, the story glori¬ 
fies Muhammad Shah of Kashmir. The work is written in easy 
Sanskrit poetry. The romantic Persian love-lyric has been amalga¬ 
mated with the Indian Saiva faith, the last canto being entirely dedi¬ 
cated to the praise of Siva. 

(ii) Historical Kdvya 

Srivara, mentioned above, was the pupil of Jonaraja who wrote 
the Dvitiya (second) Rdjatarangini. It is a continuation of Kalhana’s 
Rdjatarangini and brings the chronicle of the kings of Kashmir down 
to the time of the author’s patron Zain-ul-‘Abidin (A.D. 1420-70). 
Jonaraja, however, could not complete the history of his patron, as 
he died in the 35th year of his reign. Srivara continued the history, 
and his work, the JoAna-Rajataranginl or the Tritiya (third) 
Rdjatarangini covers the period 1459-1486. Raj avail-pataka, begun 
by Prajyabhata and completed by his pupil Suka, deals with the 
history till the annexation of Kashmir by Akbar (1586). 

Hammlra-kavya , by the Jain writer Nayachandra, describes the 
heroic deeds of Chahamana or Chauhan Hammira who bravely fought 
with the Muslims at Ranthambhor. 8a Jaitrasimha’s advice to his son 
Hammira on politics is very informing. A work of considerable 
importance for Gujarat history is the Gurugunaratnakara by Soma- 
charitragani, written in 1485, describing the life of Lakshmisaragani 
of Tapagachchha. Some historical interest attaches to the Jagadu - 


466 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


chcirita of Sarvananda, poem in praise of Jain layman who help¬ 
ed his countrymen during the disastrous Gujarat famine of 1256-57. 
Rajavinoda 9 of Udayaraja, a Hindu court-poet of Sultan Mahmud 
Begarha of Ahmadabad, deals in seven chapters with the life of the 
Sultan. Though Mahmud was notorious for his bigotry, the author 
depicts him as an orthodox king. 

Prasahgaratnavau of Pattubhatta or Potararya gives short 
accounts of princes from the great Vikramaditya to Simhabhupati, 
Raja of Pithapur. Rukmini-kalydna of Vidyachakravartin III, as 
already stated, contains the genealogy of the Hoysala kings. A his¬ 
tory of the kings of Vijayanagara from its foundation is given by 
Vidyaranya in his Rdjakdlanirnaya. Rajanatha II describes in 
Sdluvdbhyudaya the achievements of Saluva Marasimha and his 
ancestors. As there is no reference to Narasimha’s rule at Vijaya¬ 
nagara, the poem seems to have been composed about A.D. 1480. 10 

(iii) Shorter poems 

(a) Devotional. 

There are a number of stotras by the polymath Venkatanatha 
or Vedantadesika. Gita-Gaurisa by Bhanudatta, author of Rasa- 
tar angini and Rasomanjarl, appears to follow the model of Jayadeva’s 
Gitagovinda. On the lines of the Gitagovinda, again, king Purushot- 
tamadeva composed Abhinava-Gitagovinda. Stutikusumdhjali by 
the Kashmirian poet Jagaddhara, son of Ratnadhara, consists of 38 
hymns in praise of Siva. The poems of Nimai, later Gauranga and 
Sri Krishna Chaitanya, are outbursts of emotional devotion. Chai- 
tanya movement gave rise to Vaishnava lyrics in Bengal. Stavamdla 
is a collection, made by Jiva Gosvamin, of about 60 stotras and gltas 
composed by Rupa Gosvamin, an immediate disciple of Chaitanya. 
Among devotional stotras by Jains may be mentioned Jina- 
prabhasuri’s Chaturvhhsati-Jinastuti and several other hymns, and 
Jino.-stotra-ratna-kosa by Munisundarasuri. 

(b) Didactic. 

Dhanadaraja, like Bhartrihari, wrote three Satakas on Sringara, 
Nlti and Vairagya in A.D. 1434. Subhdshitanivi of Venkatanatha is a 
didactic poem like Bhartrihari’s Nltisataka. Containing 144 verses 
in diverse metres, it is symmetrically divided into 12 Paddhatis of 12 
verses each, dealing with the topics of pride, wickedness, servitude, 
nobility, tranquillity, etc. Dya Dviveda’s Nitimanjarl illustrates 
some 200 verses of maxims by tales taken from Sayana’s Rigveda- 
bhdshya. Slladuta, by Charitrasundaragani, is not a Dutakdvya as 
indicated by its name, but a didactic poem on the story of Sthula- 


467 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


bhadra, composed on the principle of Samasydpurana (taking one 
foot in each stanza from some standard work). 

(c) Erotic and Sandesa. 

Krishna!did of Madana relates Krishna’s separation from the 
Gopis in 84 stanzas in ycimaka style of Samasydpurana type, taking 
one foot from Ghatakarpara in each stanza. 

Of the imitations of the Meghaduta, which was responsible for 
a number of Dutakdvyas in the earlier epochs, there is an abundance 
in the period under review. Vehkatanatha or Vedantadesika, one of 
the polymaths of the period, wrote Hamsasandesa to vie with the 
Meghaduta. His son Varada or Nayanacharya, who vanquished in 
debate Sakalyamalla, was a great scholar and composed Kokila- 
sandesa and Sukasandesa. There is another Kokilasandesa by Ud- 
danda, a poet at the court of Manavikrama, the Zamorin, which is 
the message of a lover to his beloved at Calicut. 11 It is said to be 
in reply to a similar poem named Bhringasandesa or Bhramaraduta 
by Vasudeva, another poet at Manavikrama’s court. Vamana Bhatta 
Ban a has Hamsasandesa in imitation of Meghasandesa. Manodiita of 
Vishnudasa, said to be the maternal uncle of Chaitanya, is a pathetic 
appeal to Krishna with mind as messenger, and contains a description 
of Vrindavana. There are Hamsaduta and Uddhavaduta by Rupa 
Gosviamin. 

The Jain poets employed this form of poetry to serve religious 
purpose. In their Vijhaptipatras to their preceptors, conveying re¬ 
ports of their rainy season resorts, they dealt with philosophical doc¬ 
trines and employed Chetas, Manas, Bhakti and the like as messen¬ 
gers. Merutuhga’s Jain Meghaduta describes the life of Neminatha 
in four cantos. 

(iv) Anthologies 

Several important anthological works were composed during the 
period. The Sdrngadhara-paddhati, compiled in A.D. 1363 by Sarhga- 
dhara, son of Damodara, is an exhaustive work containing 4689 
verses in 163 sections. The number of authors and works cited 
amounts to over 300. 12 As preserving the works of South Indian 
authors, being a South Indian compilation, Suktiratnahdra of Surya 
Kalingaraja has a peculiar interest. It belongs to the fourteenth 
century. After the introductory Paddhatis its quotations are 
arranged into four Paddhatis dealing respectively with Dharma, 
Artha, Kama and Moksha. The polymath Vedantadesika wrote 
Suhhdshitanwi , 13 while Sayana, the celebrated commentator of the 
Vedas, composed Suhhdshitasudhdnidhi in 84 Paddhatis at the 


468 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


instance of king Kampa of Vijayanagara. It contains an account of 
Sayana’s family. There is the Subhdshitdvali of Kashmirian 
Srivara, pupil of Jonaraja, which cites from more than 380 poets. 
In subject-matter, arrangement and method of compilation the 
Padyavail of Rupa Gosvamin is different from the other anthologies. 
It contains 386 verses from over 125 authors. All the verses are 
devoted to Krishna and Krishnalila, and have been arranged in 
accordance with the various aspects of Krishnabhakti and the different 
episodes of the erotic career of Krishna. The arrangement of sections 
generally conforms to the rhetorical classification of the Vaishnava 
Rasasastra. 


(v) Women Poets 

Reference has been made in Chapter I to Madhurd-vijaya or 
Vira-Kampardya-charita by Gahgadevi, queen of Vlra-Kampana or 
Kamparaya, which described her husband’s victorious expeditions 
against king Champa of Kanchl and the Muslim chief of Madura. 
Abhirama KamakshI, wife of Rajanatha I, wrote Abhinavardma - 
bhyudaya in 24 cantos narrating the story of Rama in exquisite 
verse. Tirumalamba’s Varaddmbikaparinaya 14 deals with the love 
and marriage of Varadambika with her lover Achyutaraya of Vijaya¬ 
nagara in a highly artificial style. 

B. NAT AKA 

(i) Legendary themes 

Virupaksha, son of Harihara II of the Sahgama dynasty of 
Vijayanagara, wrote Nardyana-vildsa in five acts, and Unmatta- 
rdghava in one act, describing Rama’s lamentations on the loss of 
Sita. There is also another Unmattardghava, by Bhaskara, 15 called a 
Prekshdnaka, which in a single act depicts Rama’s search and mad¬ 
dening soliloquies on Slta’s transformation into a gazelle through 
Durvasas’ curse and her recovery with the aid of Agastya. The gene¬ 
ral plan is in imitation of the fourth act of the Vikramorvaslya. 

Parvatlparinaya by Vamana Bhatta Bana, sometimes wrongly as¬ 
cribed to Bana, is a dreary dramatization of the theme of Kumara- 
sambhava in five acts, dealing with the nuptials of Siva and Parvati. 
His other play Kanakalekha describes the marriage of the daughter 
of Viravarman with Vyasavarman, both Vidyadharas, born as human 
beings on account of a curse. The early life of Krishna has been 
dramatized by JIvarama in his Mumrivijaya, 16 while Krishna- 
devaraya’s Jdmbuvati-kalydna describes in five acts the story of 
Krishna’s recovery of the Syamantaka, his victory over Jambuvant, 
and his marriage with the latter’s daughter, Jambuvati. Krishna- 


469 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


devaraya’s TJshdparinaya and Prataparudradeva’s Ushdragodaya deal 
with the Usha-Aniruddha episode. 17 Saugandhika-harana is a one-act 
Vyayoga by Visvanatha, describing Bhima’s encounter with Hanu- 
mat and fetching Saugandhika flowers from Kubera’s lake. On the 
story of Arj una’s victory over Duryodhana and the Kauravas during 
their cattle-raid is based the Dhananjaya-vijaya-vyayoga of 
Kanchanacharya, son of Narayana. Virabhadravijaya by Arunagiri- 
natha II is a Dima describing the creation of Virabhadra and the 
destruction of Daksha’s sacrifice. 

(ii) Semi-historical Plays 

Vidyanatha’s Pratdparudra-kalydna 18 glorifies the poet’s 
patron, the Kakatlya ruler Frataparudra of Warangal. Gangddasa - 
pratdpa-vildsa of Gangadhara deals in nine acts with the struggle of 
Gahgadasa Pratapadeva, ruler of Champakapura (Cbampaner) and 
the poet’s patron, with Muhammad Shah II of Gujarat (A.D. 1443-51). 

(iii) Allegorical Dramas 

> 

Venkatanatha or Vedantadesika wrote Sankalpasuryodaya , an 
allegorical drama, in the manner of Prabodhachandrodaya. It is an 
answer to the latter and inculcates the Visishtadvaita philosophy. 
Ramanuja’s doctrines again figure in another allegorical drama 
V edantavilma or Yatirdjavijaya by Varadacharya 19 or Ammal 
Acharya which describes in six acts the triumph of Ramanuja. 
Bhartviharinirveda by Harihara represents Bhartrihari as desolated 
by his wife’s death through false rumour of his own death. Later, 
however, consoled by the Yogic teachings of Gorakshanatha, he 
attains indifference, so that after his wife is recalled to life he has 
no attraction either for her or for his child. The work is partly a 
didactic glorification of Hathayoga system of Gorakshanatha as a 
means of emancipation. 

(iv) Devotional Plays 

Vidagdha-mddhava (7 acts), Lalita-madhava (10 acts), and Dana - 
kelichandrikd (without acts division, called Bhdnikd) by Rupa 
Gosvamin, and Jagannatha-vallabha (5 acts) by Ramananda Raya are 
among the devotional plays on Krishnabhakti produced by the in¬ 
fluence of the Chaitanya movement. The first three illustrate the 
doctrinal aspect of the emotional Bhakti in terms of the old romantic 
Krishna legend, while the last work describes itself as a Sangita- 
ndtaka (musical drama) and contains Padavalis or songs in imitation 
of Jayadeva. Inspired by a great devotional fervour of a refined 
erotico-religious character as also by scholastic learning, their inte¬ 
rest is anything but literary and they can hardly be called dramas. 


470 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


(v) Erotic and Farcical 

Dhurtasawydgama is a Prahasana by Jyotirisvara Kavisekhara, 
son of Ramesvara, who wrote under Harasimhadeva 20 (c. 1320) of the 
Karnata dynasty of Mithila. The play relates the contest between a 
religious mendicant Visvanagara and his pupil Durachara over a love¬ 
ly courtesan Anahgasena, whom the Brahmana arbitrator Asajjati 
keeps for himself. Of the same type as the Dhurtasamdgama is the 
Somavalliyogdnanda of Arunagirinatha I, which in humorous vein 
ridicules the amorous overtures of an ascetic to a fallen married 
woman. Of uncertain date but dealing with a similar theme is the 
Hdsydrnava of Jagadisvara. The Kautukasarvasva of Goplnatha 
Chakravartin was written for the Durga festival of Bengal. It depicts 
a king Kalivatsala proclaiming free love to all and banishing all 
Brahmanas from his kingdom. 

The firing dr abhushana of Vamana Bhatta Bana is a Bhdna intro¬ 
ducing a Vita narrating his visit to the street of courtesans, inciden¬ 
tally describing the hetaera, ram-fights, cock-fights, boxing, a quarrel 
between two rivals, etc. Varadacharya, whose Veddnta-vilasa is 
noticed earlier, wrote Vasantatilaka or Ammal Bhdna containing des¬ 
criptions of magic shows, snake charmers and like, to rival Rama- 
bhadra’s firing dr atilaka or Ayya Bhdna f dealing with the amorous 
adventures of Bhujahgasekhara of Madhura. 21 

(vi) Social dramas and Court Comedies 

Mallikdmdruta, a Prakarana in ten acts by Uddanda, is a social 
drama of middle class life, following the plot of Mdlatirrvddhava in all 
details with improvements in some particulars. With its attractive 
language, melodious verse and speeches abounding in apt illustration, 
the drama has its own appeal. The Kadambarikalydna by Narasimha 
dramatizes the story of the Kadambari in eight acts. Its special fea¬ 
ture is the antarndtikd in the fifth act, which brings Kadambari in the 
presence of Chandrapida. Sathakopa in his Vdsantikaparinaya des¬ 
cribes the marriage of Ahobila Narasimha with a wood-nymph 
Vasantika. The Bhairavananda by the Nepalese Manika, son of Raja- 
vardhana and pupil of Nates vara, is a secular drama with Bhairava 
and Madanavatl, a celestial damsel cursed by a Rishi to become 
human, as hero and heroine. 

(vii) Irregular Plays 

The Subhadraparinaya on the well-known topic of the marriage 
of Subhadra, the Rdmabhyudaya , dealing with the conquest of Lanka, 
fire ordeal of Sita and return to Ayodhya, and the Pdndavdbhyudaya 
describing Draupadl’s birth and marriage, are the works of Vyasa 


471 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Sriramadeva (Ramadeva) of the fifteenth century, who was a pro¬ 
tege of Kalachuri kings of Rayapura. They style themselves as 
shadow plays, though in reality they do not differ from the ordinary 
plays. 22 

C. PROSE LITERATURE 
(i) Popular Tale: Romantic Tale 

' 

After the Brihatkathd, the next oldest collection is the Vetdla- 
pahchavimsati found in several independent versions, including the 
Kashmirian versions of the Brihatkathd by Kshemendra and Soma- 
deva, but not the Nepalese version. 23 Sivadasa’s version, in prose 
interspersed with verse, is noteworthy on account of considerable 
literary grace and narrative quality. Though a MS. of V etdlapancha- 
vimsati by Sivadasa is dated A.D. 1487, Hertel would not place 
Sivadasa much before A.D. 1487, so that he may be taken as pro¬ 
perly belonging to this period. Kshemamkara’s prose version, with 
verses at the beginning and end, which condemns the Simhasanad- 
vatrimsikd or Vikramdnka-charita, a collection of thirty-two tales of 
throne, belongs to this period. 

Bharatakadvdtrimsikd, of unknown date and authorship, con¬ 
sists of thirty-two tales ridiculing Bharatakas, who were probably 
Saiva mendicants. The inclusion of vernacular verses indicates its 
contact with the literature of the people. It may or may not be 
of Jain inspiration. The Kathdrnava of Sivadasa has stories of fools 
and knaves. The Purushapariksha of Vidyapati, who flourished 
under Sivasimha of Mithila towards the latter part of the fourteenth 
century, has moral and political tales for the instruction of children 
on the plan of Panchat antra. The tales indicate, in a simple and 
graceful style, what goes to constitute manly qualities. Some stories 
refer to historical persons and incidents. Bhuparikrama by Vidya¬ 
pati is a prose work describing Balarama’s journey round the earth— 
one of the earliest specimens of gazetteers. The Kathdkautuka of 
Srrvara, which renders in Sanskrit verse the Persian story, has al¬ 
ready been referred to. 

(ii) Didactic Tale 

Jain literature is specially rich in stories, but their main aim 
is to illustrate the tenets of the Jain faith—edification rather than 
entertainment. Champ aka-Sr eshthikathdnaka includes three tales 
one of which relates Ravana’s vain effort to avoid fate. The PJZa- 
gopdlakathdnaka of Jinakirti tells of a woman who accused a youth 
of outraging her modesty on account of his refusing her overtures. 
Both the Kathdnakas are of the nature of fantastic fairy tales. The 


472 




SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


Sarny aktvakaumudi, which is openly propagandist, illustrates by 
different tales how to obtain true religion ( Samyaktva ). The 
Kathakosa is a collection of popular tales in bad Sanskrit and Pra¬ 
krit verses. Somachandra, pupil of Ratnasekhara of Tapagachchha, 
composed in V.S. 1504 (=A.D. 1448) Kathdmahodadhi, which is a 
collection of 126 Jain stories. 

(iii) Prose Romances 

Prose romances subsequent to the seventh century are nothing 
but imitations of Subandhu and Eana. A deliberate but dreary copy 
of Bana’s Harsha-charita, the V emabhupdla-charita of Vamana 
Bhatta Bana, celebrates Vemabhupala or Viranarayana (A.D. 1402-20) 
who was the Reddi king of Kondavldu. The genealogy of this king 
is given from king Prolla, whose adventures culminate in his roman¬ 
tic marriage with princess Ananta, daughter of king Vikramasimha 
in Dakshinapatha. Our hero was the grandson of Macha, one of the 
five sons of Prolla. Verna’s expeditions in different quarters are 
then described. Agastya’s Krishna-char it a relates the life of 
Krishna based on the Bhdgavata. Merutmiga gives an account of 
some Jain saints in his Mahapurusha-charita. Charitrasundara’s 
Mahipdla-charita is a fairy tale. The battle at Srirangam between 
Hoysala Narasimha II and the combined armies of the Pandyas, 
Magadhas and Cholas, about a few years before Vlrasomesvara’s 
marriage and accession to the throne in A.D. 1234, forms the subject 
of Vidyaehakravar tin’s Gadyakarndmrita. The cause of the war 
between the PSndyas and the Hoysala king is traced to a mythical 
feud between Parasurama and Skanda. 

(iv) Champu 

The Champu form of composition appears to have been popular 
and largely cultivated in southern India. 8'rinivusavilasa-champu 
by Venkatadhvarin or Venkatesa tells the love story of a southern 
king Srinivasa. Written in two parts of five Uchchhvdsas each, the 
work imitates Bana’s alliteration and slesha with a vengeance. 
Anantabhatta (c. A.D. 1500) composed the Bharata-champu dealing 
with the Mahdbhdrata story in twelve stabakas. His nephew Soma- 
natha wrote the Vydsayogicharita-champu on the life of Vyasaraya. 
pdrijdtaharana-champu of Seshakrishna deals with the well-known 
legend of Krishna’s exploit. Chidambara, who comes shortly after 
the period covered by this volume, wrote the Bhdgavata - 
champu and the Pancha-kalydna-champu, the latter of which, at one 
stretch, relates the story of the marriage of Rama, Krishna, Vishnu, 
giva and Subrahmanya. A historical incident in the career of the 
Vijayanagara king Achyutaraya, dealing with his love and marriage 


473 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


with Varadambika, is narrated in a highly artificial Champu entitled 
Varaddmbikd-pariaaya by the woman poet Tirumalamba. Viru- 
paksha’s Chola-champu gives a fictitious account of the Chola king 
Kulottunga and his son Devachola, which is contrary to epigraphic 
evidence. * 

Like the Jain writers who employed Champu for religious pro¬ 
paganda, the Bengal Vaishnava school also wrote Champus relating 
to the Krishna legend. In his Muktacharita, Raghunathadasa, a dis¬ 
ciple of Chaitanya, indicates the superiority of Krishna’s free love 
for Radha over his conjugal love for Satyabhama. Following the 
Harivamsa and the Bhagavata Purdna, the early childhood and youth 
of Krishna are described in a rhetorical style in the much more exten¬ 
sive and artificial Gopdla-champu of Jiva Gosvamin, nephew of Rupa 
Gosvamin, and the Ananda-Vrindavana-champu of Paramananda- 
dasa-sena Kavikarnapura. The latter work deals with the early life 
of Krishna at Vrindavana, while Jiva’s work covers the entire career 
of Krishna, modifying the legend to suit the Vaishnava theology of 
Bengal of which it is a Siddhanta-grantha. 

(v) Prabandhas 

The Bhojaprabandha of Ballalasena (16th century) narrates 
interesting, though unauthentic, stories of the court of king Bhoja. 
It describes how Bhoja came to the throne, and then narrates a 
number of anecdotes showing such authors as Kalidasa, Bhavabhuti, 
Dandin and Magha as contemporaries! The Jain Prabandhas stand in 
a different category. Written in elegant prose, they freely introduce 
Prakrit and Apabhrarhsa, as well as Sanskrit, verses. They are semi- 
historical works professing to deal with historical and literary 
personages, but represent a motley collection of curious legends and 
anecdotes. Though not of much historical value, they have a charm¬ 
ing style and provide an interesting reading. The Prabandha- 
chintamani of Merutunga, completed in A.D. 1306, is divided into 5 
PrakdsaSj each containing several Prabandhas. It opens with the 
legend of Vikramaditya and Salivahana, followed by the story of the 
Chaulukya kings of Anahilwad, and the Paramara kings Bhoja and 
Munja. Then comes the account of the Vaghela kings Lavana- 
prasada and Viradhavala with their ministers Vastupala and Tejah- 
pala. In the last Prakasa are the stories of Siladitya, Lakshmana- 
sena, Umapati, Bhartrihari and others. Rajasekhara’s Prabandha - 
kosa, completed in 1348, is divided into 24 Prabandhas, and deals 
with seven royal and three lay personages, as also ten Jain teachers 
and four poets. 


474 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


III. RELIGIOUS AND PHILOSOPHICAL LITERATURE 

(i) Pur anas and Upa-Puranas 

But for the addition of very late interpolations to some of the 
minor Puranas, as Dr. Hazra calls them, such as the Varaha, Padma, 
Brahma, Skanda, Brahmavaivarta, and Bhavishya , the Puranas were 
free from the activities of revisers and interpolators during this 
period. Srldhara Svamin’s Bhagavata-Bhavartha-Dipika, the famous 
commentary on the Bhdgavata, was written during this period. Most 
of the Upa-Puranas had received their final form prior to this period. 
The Saura, Sdmba , and Devi received additional matter during this 
period. It is interesting to note that the Brahmavaivarta and Devi - 
Bhdgavata were subjected to additions owing to the activity of the 
scholars in Bengal. 

(ii) Dharmasastra — Commentaries, Nibandhas and Ritual Literature 

So far as the works on Dharmasastra are concerned, the period 
under review was but a continuation of that described earlier, viz. 
that of commentaries (tikas and bhashya s) and digests (nibandhas). 
The general tendency, however, was to write works more in the 
nature of digests dealing with all topics of Dharma. The following 
account gives a regional survey of the authors, belonging to Mithila, 
Bengal, other parts of Northern India, and the Deccan. Under each 
heading the authors have been dealt with in a chronological order. 

Mithila 

Most prominent among the Maithila writers on Dharmasastra, 
Chandesvara, son of Viresvara and grandson of Devaditya, was the 
chief judge and minister for peace and war of king Harisirhhadeva, 
mentioned above, who ascended the throne about A.D. 1280. 
Chandesvara’s Smritiratnakara is an exhaustive digest, dealing in 
seven sections with Kritya, Dana, Vyavahara, Suddhi, Puja, Vivada 
and Grihastha. As indicated by their titles, Krityaratnakara deals 
with various vratas and observances, Ddnaratnakara with gifts, 
Vyavahara 0 with judicial procedure, Suddhi 0 with impurity and 
purification, Puja° with worship, Vivada 0 with civil and criminal 
law in its eighteen divisions, and Grihastha 0 with duties of house¬ 
holders. Along with Vivadachintamani of Vachaspati, of which 
it formed the basis, the Vivadaratnakara is considered supreme 
authority in matters of Hindu Law in Mithila. Chandesvara’s Kri- 
tyachintamani discusses astronomical matters in relation to the 
performance of various religious ceremonies and Samskaras. His 
Rajanitiraindkara, to be considered later under “Polity”, was 
written at the command of the king Bhavesa or Bhavasimha. It 


475 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


thus appears that Chandesvara had a long literary career of over 
50 years and RdjaniUratndkara was probably his last production 
composed at a very advanced age. 

Another Maithila writer was Mahamahopadhyaya Harinatha, 
who wrote Smritisdra, hitherto available only in MSS., on several 
topics of Dharmasastra. Samskaras, rites on death, Sraddha, Praya- 
schitta, various titles of law and judicial procedure are the main 
topics found in the MSS. As Harinatha mentions Kalpataru and 
Harihara, and he is quoted by Sulapani, Misaru Misra, Vachaspati 
Misra, Raghunandana, Kamalakara and later writers, the period of 
his activity falls between 1250 and the last quarter of the fourteenth 
century. There is no reference to Harinatha in Chandesvara’s works, 
voluminous as they are, nor does Harinatha refer to Chandesvara. 
So they were probably contemporaries. 

The next Maithila writer was Rudradhara, son of Mahamaho¬ 
padhyaya Lakshmldhara and youngest brother of Haladhara, who 
wrote several works on Dharmasastra including Suddhiviveka , 
Srdddhaviveka, Vrata-paddhati and Varshakritya. The Suddhiviveka 
is an exhaustive treatise on purification dealing with all its aspects, 
while Srdddhaviveka contains full particulars about the Sraddhas. 
Rudradhara mentions, among others, the Ratndkara, the Smritisdra, 
and the Srdddhaviveka of Sulapani, indicating his posteriority to 
A.D. 1425. As he is quoted by Vachaspati and Govindananda and a 
MS. of his Vrata-paddhojti is dated L.S. 344 (c. A.D 1463), he is 
earlier than A.D. 1460. 24 

Misaru Misra, the celebrated author of Vivadachandra and 
Pad^drtha-chandrikd (on the Nyaya-Vaiseshika system), is the next 
Maithila v/riter. Vivadachandra, dealing with several titles of law 
and with procedure, and a recognized authority on Hindu Law in 
Mithila, was written at the command of princess LachhimadevI, wife 
of Chandrasiriiha, probably the younger brother of Bhairavasimha- 
deva of the Sugauna dynasty of Mithila. Misaru Misra quotes Chan¬ 
desvara and criticises him, and his patron Chandrasimha flourished 
about the middle of the fifteenth century, so that Misaru Misra be¬ 
longs to this period. 

Finally comes Vachaspati Misra, the doyen of Maithila Nibandha - 
kdras , who was the adviser in Dharmasastra of Maharajadhiraja 
Harinarayana and his son Rupanarayana. His Vivddachintdmani 
occupied a pre-eminent position of authority in Hindu Law in 
Mithila in the British Indian High Courts and the Privy Council. 
Vachaspati Misra was a voluminous writer, having about a dozen 
works with the title of chintdmani and several with tbe title of 
nirnaya. 25 As he refers to Chandesvara and Rudradhara, Vachaspati 


476 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


Misra was later than A.D. 1425, and as he is quoted by Govindananda 
and Raghunandana, he came before A.D. 1540. A MS. of his Suddhi- 
nirnaya was copied in Sam. 1416 (i.e. Saka 1416 = A.D. 1494-5). So 
it appears that Vachaspati Misra should be assigned to the latter 
half of the fifteenth century. 26 

Bengal 

From Mithila, we turn to the Bengal writers on Dharmasastra. 
Two of the famous Bengal triumvirate, viz. Sulapani and Raghu¬ 
nandana, belong to this period. Sulapani is the recognized authority 
on Dharmasastra in Bengal, next only to Jimutavahana. In his 
Dipakalikd, a short commentary on Yajnavalkya, which seems to be 
his earliest work, Sulapani holds somewhat archaic views on inherit¬ 
ance. Smritiviveka was intended to incorporate several vivekas, 
small treatises on different topics of Dharmasastra, of which fourteen 
are known to have been written. 27 Practically nothing is known 
about the personal history of Sulapani, and his date is uncertain. 
He names Chandesvara’s Ratndkara and Kdlamddhaviya, so that he 
is later than c. A.D. 1375, considering that some time is necessary 
for the latter, a work from Vijayanagara, to be authoritative in 

_ V _ 

Bengal. As Rudradhara, Govindananda and Vachaspati mention 
Sulapani’s works, he is earlier than c. A.D. 1460. 

Hailing from Bagri in Southern Bengal, Govindananda is the 
next Bengal writer on Dharmasastra during the period under review. 
He was the son of Ganapatibhatta and was styled Kavikankana- 
charya. His works are of particular interest to historians on account 
of numerous authors and works quoted therein. Ddnakaumudi , 
Suddhikaumudi, SrdddJnakaumudl and Varshakriyakaumudl, out of 
his several works, have been hitherto published. His Arthakaumudi 
is a commentary on the Suddhidtpikd of Srinivasa and Tattvdrtha - 
kaumudl on the Prayaschittaviveka of Sulapani. From the facts that 
Govindananda quotes Madanapdrijata, Rudradhara and Vachaspati, 
is quoted by Raghunananda, and his SudAhikaumudi examines inter- 
calarly months from 'Saka 1414 to Saka 1457 (A.D. 1492-1535), it has 
been inferred that his literary activity lay between A.D. 1500 and 
1540. 28 

Raghunandana, the last great writer of Bengal on Dharma¬ 
sastra and the third of the famous triumvirate, was the son of 
Harihara Bhattacharya and a pupil of Srmatha Acharya-Chuda- 
mani. Tradition credits him with being a student of the cele¬ 
brated Vasudeva Sarvabhauma along with Lord Chaitanya. He was 
called Smartabhattacharya or Srnarta on account of his thorough 
mastery over Smriti and his erudition evident in the Smrititattva 


477 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


which is an encyclopaedic work on the different branches of Dharma 
divided into 28 Tattvas. 29 It would not be feasible to give even a 
brief summary of the Tattvas; their very names indicate the subject- 
matter. Besides Smriti-tattva, Raghunandana wrote several works 
including Tirtha-tattva, Tripushkarasdnti-tattva, Dvddasaydtd-tattva , 
Gayd-Sraddha-paddhati, Rasaydtrd-padahati, and a commentary 
on the Dayabhaga. The commentary has been hailed as the best on 
the Dayabhaga by the Calcutta High Court and Bengal school respects 
his authority. However, his works are not in much vogue outside 
Bengal. If he was the fellow student of Chaitanya, he must have 
been born c. 1490. Raghunandana is quoted and criticised by Vira- 
mitrodaya and by Nilakantha which proves him to be earlier than 
1600. His mention of Madhavacharya, Sulapani, Rudradhara and 
Vachaspati places him later than 1500. MSS. of some of his works 
are dated about 1575 which fixes the later limit for him. His lite¬ 
rary activity lies between 1520 and 1570. 

Other parts of Northern India 

Several authoritative works on Dharmasastra and other topics 
were compiled under the patronage of king Madanapala of the family 
of Taka kings that ruled in Kashtha on the Yamuna. Madanapdrijdta, 
Smritvmahdrnava (or Madanamahdrnava ), Tithinirnayasdra and 
Smritikaumudi are the Dharmasastra works ascribed to Madanapala. 
The Madanapdrijdta, though ascribed to Madanapala, was really 
composed by the author of Subodhini, i.e. Visvesvarabhatta, son of 
Pedibhatta and Ambika, who was a native of Dravida country and 
migrated to north India after composing Subodhini. The Banaras 
school of Hindu Law looks upon Visvesvara as one of its leading 
authorities. In a simple and lucid style the nine chapters of the 
Madanapdrijdta deal respectively with Brahmacharya, Grihastha- 
dharma, Ahnikakritya, Samskaras, Asaucha, Dravyasuddhi, Sraddha, 
Dayabhaga and Prayaschitta, the chapter on Dayabhaga closely fol¬ 
lowing the Mitakshard. The Mahdrnava, which is ascribed to 
Mandhata, son of Madanapala, is mainly concerned with describing 
how various bodily diseases result from past evil deeds, and pre¬ 
scribing various rites and penances for the eradication of bad re¬ 
sults. Visvanatha, probably a paraphrase of the name of Visvesvara, 
appears to have composed the Tithinirnayasdra. The Smritikaumudi, 
whose author claims the authorship of Mahdrnava, exhaustively 
deals in four chapters with the dharma of the Sudra, discussing 
the kinds of Sudras, their adhikara for religious rites, marriage, 
observances, iSraddha and daily duties for Sudra. Besides these, 
Madanapala compiled several other works, famous among them being 
the Madananighantu to be described later. Madanapdrijdta and 


478 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


Maharnava mention Smritichandrikd and Hemadri’s Chaturvarga - 
chintdmani, indicating A.D. 1300 as the earlier limit for Madanapala. 
Since the Nrisimha-prasada, Narayanabhatta, ftaghunandana and 
Govindananda quote the Madanaparijata, they supply A.D. 1500 
as terminus ad quern. MSS. of Suryasiddhanta-viveka and 
Madananighantu compiled by Madanapala, which were respectively 
copied down in A.D. 1402-3 and composed in A.D. 1375, narrow 
down the literary activity of Madanapala to between A.D. 1360 and 
1390. 

Madanaratnapradipa or Madanapradipa, of which the vyavahara 
section has recently been published, was divided into seven sections 
{Uddyotas) called Samaya, Achara, Vyavahara, Prayaschitta, Dana, 
Suddhi and Santi. The work was composed under the patronage of 
king Madanasimhadeva, son of Saktisiihha, mentioned above, 29a who 
ruled over Gorakhpur-Champaran. Manuscripts of Amarakosa and 
Narasimhapumna were copied respectively in A.D. 1453-54 and La 
Sam 339 when Madanasimhadeva was ruling over Champakaranya- 
nagara and Gorakshapura, indicating c. 1425-1450 as the date of 
Madanasimha. Madanaratna confirms this date, as it mentions MiU 
akshara, Kalpataru and Hernadri (i.e. later than 1300) and is quoted 
by Narayanabhatta, Kamalakarabhatta, Nilakantha and Mitramisra 
(i.e. before 1500). Prataparudradeva 30 of the Gajapati dynasty, who 
ruled at Cuttack, invited an assembly of Pandits to compile a com¬ 
prehensive digest of civil and criminal law called Sarasvativildsa. 
The work occupies an important position, next to Mitakshara , in 
matters of Hindu Law in Southern India. As Prataparudradeva 
ruled from A.D. 1497 to A.D. 1540, the work belongs to the first 
quarter of the sixteenth century. 

Deccan 

Now we turn to works produced in the south. The polymath 
Madhavacharya, the brightest gem among southern writers on 
Dharmasastra, wrote several works of which Pardsara-Madhaviya and 
Kala-Madhava are most important. Written as a commentary on 
Pardsara-smriti, Pardsara-Madhaviya is a digest of civil and religious 
law, devoting about a fourth of its extent to Vyavahara on which 
original Parasara has no verse. The style is lucid, and lengthy and 
abstruse discussions are avoided. The work is held an authority 
on Hindu Law in Southern India. Kalanirnaya is an extensive trea¬ 
tise in five chapters on time, dealing with time and its nature; year, 
seasons, months, intercalary months, and religious acts allowed and 
forbidden in intercalary months; disquisition on tithi, nakshatra, 
yoga, karana, sankrdnti, eclipses, etc. 


479 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Finally we come to Nfisiihlw-prasada, another work hailing 
from the South, which is an encyclopaedia of Dharmasastra in twelve 
sections. 31 The work derives its title from the deity who is invoked 
at the beginning of each section. The author Dalapati, son of 
Yallabha and the pupil of Surya Pandita, was chief minister and 
keeper of records of Nizam Shah of Devagiri. The author’s master 
appears to be Ahmad Nizam Shah. As the Pamsara-Mddhaviya and 
Madanapdrijdta are relied on in Nrisbhha-prasdda, it is later than 
A.D. 1400, and as it is quoted in Dvaitanirnaya and by Nilakantha, it 
is earlier than A.D. 1575. Samvat 1568 or 69, which, appears at the 
end of several sections of the work, may be the date of its com¬ 
position or of copying of the MS. Thus the work appears to have 
been composed between A.D. 1490 and 1512. 

(iii) Philosophy 

Sarvadarsanasamgraha of Madhava, brother of Sayana, is the 
most famous of several critical reviews of philosophical systems 
written in India. It deals with sixteen different darsanas (systems) 
arranged from the point of view of error. First come the materia¬ 
listic Charvakas followed by Buddhism and Jainism, after which 
come six sectarian theologies, namely, four schools of gaivism, 
Ramanuja and Purnaprajha; then come Vaiseshika, Nyaya, Purva 
Mimamsa, a grammatical school ascribed to Banini, Samkhya, Yoga, 
and finally Vedanta. Madhava also wrote Jaimimya-nydya-mdld- 
vistara which is an exposition of the Mimamsa system in verse 
accompanied by a prose commentary. Earlier than Madhava is 
Parthasarathi Misra who wrote several works on Bhatta Mimamsa 
including Nydyaraindkara (a commentary on Kumarila’s Sloka - 
vdrttika), Sdstradipikd (an independent and popular manual on the 
Mimamsa system according to the Kumarila School), and Tantra- 
ratna. Nydyasudha or Rdnaka by Somesvara (c. 1400) is a commen¬ 
tary on Kumarila’s Tantravdrttika. 

In Vedanta, Madhava wrote Jwanmuktiviveka and Pahchadasi 
(partly written by Bharat! Tirtha) which follow and support 
Sankara’s views. Brahma-vidydbharana of Advaitananda (fifteenth 
century) is a prose commentary on Sahkara-bhashya, while Sada- 
nanda, the disciple of Advaitananda, wrote a brief outline of Advaita 
Vedanta in prose in his Veddntasdra which is a useful introduction 
to the philosophy. 

Vallabhiacharya in his Anubhdshya on the Brahmasutras pro¬ 
pounded the Suddhadvaita system or pure monism. According to 
Vallabha, Bhakti is both the means and the end; it is given by God; 

480 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


it comes by His grace. The teacher on earth is regarded as divine 
and receives divine honours. 

Sdmkhya-pravachana-sutra of Kapila has been assigned to the 
fourteenth century as the Sarvadarsanasamgraha does not refer to 
it and bases its account on the Sdmkhyakarikd. Vijnanabhikshu 3 la 
in his Sdmkhya-pravachana-bhashya endeavours to minimise the dis¬ 
tinction between Samkhya and theistic Vedanta which he regards as 
genuine Vedanta, while Advaita Vedanta is considered its modern 
falsification. Vijnanabhikshu also wrote Sdmkhya-sdra, Yoga - 
vdrttika, Yogasdra-samgraha and Vijnndndmrita, a commentary on the 
Brahmasutra. 

Vijnanabhikshu’s two works on Yoga are useful manuals. Criti¬ 
cising Vachaspati’s views on some points, Vijnanabhikshu attempts 
to bring the Yoga system nearer the philosophy of the Upanishads. 
Godavaramisra, the Rajaguru and Mantrl of Gajapati Prataparudra 
of Orissa, has written Yogachintdmani which is a compendium based 
on the principles and practices of Yoga as enjoined by Patanjali, 
Vyasa, Vaehaspati and Bhoja. 32 

Tattvachintdmani-vydkhyd by Vasudeva Sarvabhauma on 
Gangesa’s Tattvachintdmani is regarded as the first great work of 
the Navadvipa school. He was the Guru of the great Chaitanya, 
Raghunatha (author of Didhiti and Paddrthakhandana ), Raghunan- 
dana, the jurist, and Krishnananda, the great Tantrik authority. 
Laugakshi Bhaskara’s Tarkakaumudl is a symmetrical work like 
Sivddiiya’s Saptapadarthi, taking Nyaya and Vaiseshika principles 
as one whole based on Prasastapada’s treatise. Sankara Misra’s 
Upaskara on Vaiseshikasutras is a work of some importance. 

Vedantadesika (or Venkatanatha) was a prolific writer on many 
subjects, chief among his philosophical works being Sesvara- 
mlmdmsd, Nydya-siddhdnta and Tattva-muktdkaldpa; Tattva-tlkd and 
Tatparyachandrikd are his commentaries on Ramanuja’s Snbhdshya 
and Gitd-bhdshya respectively. The Scsvara-mimdmsd treats of 
Purva and Uttara Mimarhsa as parts of one whole, and argues that 
Karma cannot produce its fruits without the aid of divine agency. 

IV. TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE 

(i) Grammar 

Most of the works of this period are based upon the Ashtadhyayl 
of Panini. Riipamdld of Vimalasarasvati, which is not later than 
A.D. 1350, is the earliest and the simplest of the recasts of Ashta- 
dhydyl now extant. Ramachandra (c. A.D. 1400) has rearranged the 
material of Panini in his Prakriya-kaumudi, on which is based the 

481 

D.S.—31 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


famous Siddhdnta-kaumudi of Bhattoji Dikshita, who flourished bet¬ 
ween A.D. 1560 and 1620. Bhattoji is also credited with the author- 
ship of the Sabda-kaustubha. From the Siddhdnta-kaumudi sprang 
a little later smaller treatises like the Madhya-siddhdnta-kaumudi, 
the Laghu-kaumudl and the Sdra-kaumudi of Varadaraja (seven¬ 
teenth century), who is also supposed to have written the Girvuna- 
padamanjan. There is a Dhatuvritti ascribed to Madhava (fourteenth 
century), the brother of Say ana. 

In the Hemachandra school Hemahariisavijayagani put together 
a collection of about 140 paribhdshds or maxims of interpretation 
used in Hemachandra’s grammar and wrote a commentary on them 
called the Nydydrthamanjushd in V.S. 1515 (=A.D. 1458) at 
Ahmadabad. Gunaratnasuri, a pupil of Devasundarasuri, wrote 
Kriydratnasamuchchaya in V.S. 1466 (=A.D. 1409) on the use of 
conjugational peculiarities of the most important Sanskrit roots. 
Hemachandra school had but a short career. After the age of commen¬ 
tators in the fifteenth century it fell more or less into neglect, chiefly 
on account of lack of originality and the sectarian character of its 
founder and followers. 

In the Sarasvata school, the period subsequent to the stereo¬ 
typed form given to the system by Anubhutisvarupacharya was 
mainly of commentaries and sub-commentaries. During the period 
under review we get commentaries by Punjaraja, a minister to 
Ghiyas-ud-dln Khalji of Malwa (1469-1500), who also wrote Sisu- 
prabodha on Alamkara and Dhvanipradipa; Amritabharati, pupil of 
Amalasarasvatl, the earliest known MS of whose commentary 
Subodhikd is dated V.S. 1554 (A.D. 1497); Madhava, pupil of Srl- 
raiiga, the MS. of whose commentary is dated V.S. 1591 (A.D. 1534), 
and Chandraklrti, a Jain belonging to the Brihadgachchha of Nagpur, 
author of Subodhikd or Dipikd, who was honoured by Sahi Salum. 

The period witnessed the founding of the Saupadma school by 
a Maithila Brahmana, Padmanabhadatta, son of Damodaradatta, who 
gives his date as 1297 Saka era (=A.D. 1374) in his Prishodai'd- 
divritti. His work, the Saupadma , is based upon that of Panini (of 
which it retains most of the terminology) with the remodelling of 
a greater part of the rules and their rearrangement in a methodical 
form, each Sutra having a short explanatory note. Besides works 
on Unadis, Dhatus, Paribhashas, metrics, lexicography, etc., Padma¬ 
nabhadatta himself has written a commentary on his grammar called 
Supadmapahjikd. The influence of the Saupadma school is at pre¬ 
sent confined to parts of Central Bengal. 

The best of the recasts of Sakatayana grammar is the Prakri- 
yasamgraha by Abhayachandracharya. Modelled on works like 


482 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


Prakriyakaumudi it omits a large number of original sutras unneces¬ 
sary in a work for beginners, and amplifies a few others. Nanda- 
kisorabhatta wrote a treatise to supplement the Mugdhabodha of 
Bopadeva in A.D. 1398. 

The tendency of introducing religious elements in grammar, al¬ 
ready noticed in Bopadeva, 33 has been carried to the extremes in 
the two Vaishnava grammars called Harindmamrita, which make 
grammar the vehicle of religion. Rupa Gosvamin, the famous 
Vaishnava devotee of Chaitanya, is the author of one Harindmamrita, 
in which the names of Radha and Krishna and their acts are employ¬ 
ed, not merely by way of illustration, but as actual technical terms. 
The other Harindmamrita is by Jiva Gosvamin which differs but 
slightly from its namesake. These grammars are at present in use 
among the Vaishnavas of Bengal. 

Fifteenth century marks the most glorious period of commen¬ 
taries in the Bengal school of Panini. Narapatimahamisra wrote 
Nydsaprdkdsa, a commentary on the Nyasa • Nandana Misra wrote 
Nydsoddipand on the Nyasa and commented on the Tantrapradipa, on 
which Sanatana Tarkacharya wrote a gloss named Prabha and also 
Phakkikavrtti. Pundarikaksha Vidyasagara, one of the greatest 
scholars of Bengal, wrote an independent work Kdraka-kaumudi, 
and commentaries on Nyasa, Kdtantratikd 3 Kavyadarsa, Kavya- 
prakasa, Bhattikdvya etc. Srlmaii Misra has commentaries on all 
the three classical works of the Bengal school of Panini, viz. Nyasa, 
Anunydsa and Tantrapradipa . During the period under review there 
arose in Bengal a host of commentaries and supplements also to the 
Katantra grammar which is studied there most assiduously. 

(ii) Lexicography 

Out of the Ekaksharakosas, which are monosyllabic dictionaries 
and deal with words of only a single syllable, the following appear¬ 
ed during the period under review: Ekaksharanamamdld of Sudha- 
kalasa (14th century) and Ekdkshararatnamala of Madhava, son of 
Mayana and minister of Harihara, consisting of three Kdndas, Svara, 
Vyanjana and Samyukta. There is a bigger portion of homonyms 
and smaller of synonyms in the Bhuriprayoga of Padmanabhadatta, 
founder of the Saupadma school of Grammar, who composed his 
Prishodaradivritti in A.D. 1374. Out of the several works more or 
less based on the Abhidhdnachintdmani of Hemachandra was the 
Panchavarga-nama-sarhgraha of Subhasilagani (15th century), who 
also composed the Unddi-ndmamdld. The Sabdaratnakara of Mahipa* 
of which the homonymous section bears the title Anekartha- or 
Nanartha-tilaka, bears the date A.D. 1374. There is Ndmrtharatna- 


483 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


mala by Irupaga Dandadhinatha or Bhaskara who lived under 
Harihara II of Vijayanagara (14th century). Brihaspati Rayamukuta, 
a famous commentator on the Amarakosa, flourished during this 
period. Apparaya, at the court of Singabhupala (c. 1400) wrote a 
commentary on the Amarakosa. There is a difference of opinion 
about the identity of Vamana Bhatta Bana whose Sabdaratndkara 
has the homonyms and avyayas at the end. Sabdachandrika is also 
ascribed to him. Madanavinodanighntu, better known as Madana- 
pdlanighantu, composed by Madanapala in 1374, is an extensive work 
comprising about 2250 verses divided into 14 vargas. It is a compre¬ 
hensive dictionary of materia medica containing “the names of medi¬ 
cal drugs, the qualities of drugs and of dishes and of the flesh of 
various animals.” 

(iii) Poetics and Dramaturgy 

The period under review has been included by Dr. De under 
scholastic age, which was characterized by works showing systema¬ 
tic compilation and arrangements and by commentaries. The era 
of creative work and critical elaboration had already passed. The 
age of original or thoughtful writers was long gone by and it was 
succeeded by the age of commentators, interpreters, and critics. 
From this it was only a matter of time to degenerate into a host of 
manuals and manuals of manuals. 

(a) Poetics 

The Prataparudrayasobhushana by Vidyanatha consists of the 
usual three parts—Karikas, Vritti and illustrations, the last being 
composed by the author in honour of his patron Prataparudradeva, 
the Kakatlya king of Telingana. Its nine chapters deal respectively 
with Nayaka, Kavya, Nataka, Rasa, Dosha, Guna, Sabdalamkara, Artha- 
lamkara and Misralamkara, and cover the same ground as Visva- 
natha’s Sahityadarpana. Vidyanatha follows Mammata in general, 
but prefers Bhoja in the matter of Gunas and Ruyyaka in the matter 
of Alamkaras. Parinama, Ullekha, Vichitra and Vikalpa are the new 
Alamkaras mentioned by Vidyanatha which are not found in Mam¬ 
mata. Ratndpana by Kumarasvamin, son of the famous Mallinatha, 
is a good commentary on the Prataparudrayasobkushana. Malli¬ 
natha, who also flourished during the period under review, is well 
known for his commentaries on the five Mahakavyas. Bhanudatta, 
son of Ganesvara and a native of Mithila, is the author of two works 
on poetics, Rasatarangini and Rasamanjari. The former is divided 
into 8 tarangas and deals mainly with the various components of the 
Rasas such as Bhava, Vibhava, Anubhava, etc., and also with various 
Rasas and three kinds of Drishtis. The Rasamanjari is a smaller 


484 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


treatise dealing with the nature of the heroes and heroines, the 
Sattvika gunas, two varieties of Sringara, ten stages of Vipralambha, 
etc. All examples, except those with expressly contrary indications, 
are by the author. As he mentions Sringdraprakdsa, Sarasvatl- 
kanthdbharana, Kdvya-prakdsa, Gitagovinda and Rasaratnapradl - 
pika, Bhanudatta is not earlier than A.D. 1250. As a commentary 
on Rasamahjari by Gopala called Vikdsa was composed in A.D. 
1572, 34 the date of Bhanudatta appears to be between A.D. 1450-1500. 

Singabhupala, the author of the Rasdrnavasudhakara, was the 
son of Anapota and Annamamba of the Recharla dynasty. A versa¬ 
tile scholar, patron of letters and a profuse writer, he was called 
Sarvajna and was also known as Khadganarayana. Besides Rasdrna- 
vasudhakara he wrote a small drama Kuvalaydvali and a commen¬ 
tary on the Sahgitaratnakara of Sarhgadeva. 35 The Rasdrnava - 
sudhdkara, based on Sringdraprakdsa and Bhdvaprakdsa , is a com¬ 
prehensive and elaborate work dealing in its three vilasas, respec¬ 
tively with (1) the qualities, classification etc. of heroes and heroines; 
Uddlpana-vibhavas, Ritis and Gunas, dramatic Vrttis, etc.; (2) 
Vyabhicharibhavas, Anubhavas, Sthayibhavas, Rasas, etc.; and (3) 
the drama, its varieties, characteristics, etc. The Nataka^paribhasha, 
said to be a separate work on dramaturgy by Singabhupala, is but 
a part of Rasdrnavasudhdkara. It draws directly on Bharata, Rudra- 
bhatta, Dasarupaka and others. Visvesvara, a court poet of Singa- 
bhupala, wrote Chamatkdra-chandrikd on rhetorics, which has illus¬ 
trations in praise of Singabhupala, Vemabhupaia, generally known 
as Peda Komati Verna Reddi, who succeeded Kumaragiri on the throne 
in c. A.D. 1402 and bore the title Viranarayana, was a royal author 
and a patron of learning. 3153 He was the hero of Vemabhupdla- 
charita and patronized Srlnatha and Vamana Bhatta Bana. He wrote 
Sahitya-chintdmani (or -chuddmani) on poetics and Sahgita-chudd- 
mani on music. The former deals with Dhvani, gabdartha, Dhvani- 
bheda, Gmnblnutavydngya , Dosha, Guna and Aldmkdra in seven 
chapters. 36 

Son of Mahakavi Chandrasekhara and grandson of Narayana, 
both learned men and authors, Visvanatha held high offices in the 
court of the king of Orissa and bore the title Sandhivigrahika Maha- 
patra. Sahityadarpana, written in the form of Karika and Vritti 
like Kdvyaprakdsa is more simple and less controversial in style than 
the Kdvyaprakdsa and Rasagangddhara respectively. The first 
chapter discusses the definition of poetry followed by the definitions 
of a sentence and a word and the three powers of a word. There is 
a full disquisition on rasas, bhavas and other cognate topics in the 
third chapter while the next deals with the two divisions of Kavya 


485 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


(i.e. Dhvani and Gunibhutavyangya) and their subdivisions. The 
fifth establishes the existence of Vyanjana. The science of drama¬ 
turgy receives a full and complete treatment in the sixth chapter. 
In the next two chapters are considered respectively the Doshas and 
Gunas of Kavya. The four styles of composition are described in 
the ninth chapter, while Sabdalamkaras and Arthalamkaras are 
exhaustively dealt with in the concluding chapter. The date of 
Visvanatha falls between A.D. 1300 and 1380. The Sahityadarpana 
treats all the aspects of the science of rhetorics in a thorough-going 
and exhaustive manner in a simple and flowing style. The magni¬ 
tude of Visvanatha’s contribution to poetics, compiler though he was, 
has been lessened to a certain extent by the comparison of Sdhitya- 
darpana with the Dipika of Chandidasa, which shows that Visvanatha 
was considerably indebted to the latter especially with regard to the 
views which were hitherto held to be his own. Besides Sahitya- 
darparta, Visvanatha wrote a commentary on the Kdvyaprakasa , 
Rdghavavildsa-kdvya, Narasimha-vijaya-kdvya , Chandrakald-natika. 
Prdbhdvati-parvnaya , Kuvalaydsva-charita in Prakrit, Prasastiratna- 
vali, and a Karambhaka in sixteen languages. 37 

The famous commentator Mallinatha wrote a commentary 
Tarala on the Ekdvali of Vidyadhara. Kdvyaddkini of Gangananda, 
a court poet of Maharaja Kama of Bikaner (1506-1527), deals with 
doshas (poetical blemishes) in five chapters. He also wrote Karna - 
bhushana, a treatise on Rasa in five chapters, dealing with Vibhavas, 
Anubhavas, Vyabhicharibhavas, Sthayibhavas, and Rasas. 

The influence of Bengal Vaishnavism was felt in the domain of 
poetics also. Rupa Gosvamin’s V jjvala-nilamani attempts to place 
the Vaishnava doctrine of TJjjvala or Madhura Rasa in the garb and 
phraseology of the Rasa theory. Madhura Rasa is a phase of Bhakti 
Rasa, not of the Sringara Rasa. The Vaishnava theology speaks of 
five Rasas representing roughly the degrees of realization of Bhakti, 
viz. Santa, Dasya, Sakhya , Vdtsalya and Mddhurya, the last being 
also called TJjjvala or Bhakti-rasa~rdt, which forms the subject-matter 
of Ujjvala-nilamani. 

(b) Dramaturgy 

Besides the Rasdrnavasudhdkara and Sahityadarpana , works on 
poetics which deal exhaustively with dramaturgy, there were other 
works specifically written on dramaturgy during this period. 

There is an able discussion of Rasa and Abhinaya and their 
mutual relation in the Natdnkusam (c. 14th century). The first 
chapter of the Samgitardja by Kumbhakarna or Rana Kumbha deals 
with dramaturgy and dramatic expression, and the fifth with Rasa , 


486 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


where heroes, heroines, and sentiments are discussed. Though 
entirely lost at present, the citations from the Vasantarujlyam by 
Kumaragiri, a Reddi king who ruled the Telugu country towards the 
close of the fourteenth century, show that it dealt with principles of 
dramaturgy, Rasa and Sakunasastram. Following the dicta of 
Bharata and Rasasudhdkara and rejecting those of the Sdhitya- 
darpana as they were opposed to Bharata, Rupa Gosvamin’s Ndtaka- 
chandrikd treats dramaturgy in eight sections dealing with (1) the 
general characteristics of the drama, (2) the nayaka, (3) the divisions 
of the Rupaka, (4) elements in the action ( sandhi, pataka , etc.), and 
their classification, (5) Arthopakshepa and its divisions, (6) divisions 
of acts and scenes, (7) Distribution of dialects, and (8) styles of 
dramatic composition and adaptation to the several Rasas. Most of 
the examples have been taken from the Vaishnava works. 

(iv) Music 

Works on music may be called the special feature of this period, 
and these are found both from the north and the south. The inte¬ 
rest of the royalty was not confined to liberal patronage to musicians, 
but there were several works on music by royal authors, as we shall 
presently see. 

There were two well-known commentaries on Sarhgadeva’s 
SamgUaratnakara during this period. One was Sudhdkara by Singa- 
bhupala who has been referred to earlier. The other was Kaldnxdhi 
by Kallinatha of Sandilya gotra, son of NarayanI and Lakshmldhara, 
who was at the court of Immadi Devaraya of Vijayanagara. Accord¬ 
ing to Dr. Raja there is not enough evidence for a third commentary 
by Kumbhakarna. 38 Damoclara’s Sung itadarp ana follows Sarngadhara 
with additional matter taken from other sources. Sangitardja by 
Kumbhakarna 39 or Kumbha Rana, who ruled at Chitrakuta, is a volu¬ 
minous work containing five chapters of which the first and fifth, 
as already stated, related respectively to dramaturgy and poetics. 
The treatment of vocal music igita) and musical instruments ( vadya ) 
in the second and third chapters is thorough and exhaustive. The 
fourth chapter deals with dressing, gesticulation and dance ( nritya). 
Madanapala of the Gahadaviala dynasty, author of Madanavinoda- 
nighantu and a work on Dharmasastra, is said to have written 
Anandasanjtvana on singing, dancing, musical instruments, and 
vagas • Sangitopanishad by Sudhakalasa, a Jain and a pupil of Raja- 
sekharasuri, deals with music and dancing in six chapters, and also 
includes a commentary, the whole being completed in A.D. 1349. 

The polymath Vidyaranya has written Sangitasdra on music. 
Gopendra Tippa Bhupala of the Saluva dynasty of Vijayanagara 


487 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


wrote Tdladipika in three chapters on Marga and desl Talas. Svara- 
rdgasudhdrasam or Natyachuddmani is a learned treatise on music 
and dancing. The author Somanarya, who was probably identical 
with the Telugu poet Nachan Soman, follows Narada and frequently 
differs from Bharata. Dancing forms the major part of Matanga 
Bharata by Lakshmana Bhaskara (c. 14th century)- Lakshanadipikci 
by Gauranarya, son of Ayama Prabhu, who was the brother of 
Pot ana, the minister of Singaya Madhava of Recharla dynasty, is a 
general treatise on poetry, music and dancing. Sangitasuryodaya 
of Lakshmmarayana, who was the state musician under Krishna- 
devaraya of Vijayanagara, deals in five adhyayas, with Tala, Vritta, 
Svaraglta, Jati and Prabandha. 

(v) Metrics 

Popular like the Vrittaratnakara of Kedarabhatta 40 is the 
Chhandomanjarl of Gangadasa (between A.D. 1300 and 1500) 41 
which illustrates different metres by verses in honour of Krishna. 
Padmanabha, author of the Saupadma-vydkarana , wrote Chhando- 
ratna on metres. Numerous other works of very late date and of 
little importance are available. Of these the Vrittaratndkara-tikd 
composed by Narayana in A.D. 1545 may be mentioned. 

(vi) Erotics 

Numerous works of comparatively late origin are available on the 
subject of love, though there were several during the period under 
review. The Panchasdyaka by Jyotirisvara Kavisekhara, author of 
the Dhurtasamdgama, 42 epitomises in five parts all that is said in 
standard works on Kamasastra. Praudhadevaraya of Vijayanagara 
(15th century) composed the Ratiratnapradipikd in seven chapters 
which is an elaborate treatise on sexual pleasures. The Kdmasamuhci 
of Ananta, discussing almost all aspects of love, was written in 
A.D. 1457. 43 The Ratimanjan of Jayadeva (different from the 
author of the Gitagovind,a) and the Anangamanjafl of Kalyanamalla 
both belong to the sixteenth century. 

(vii) Medicine 

Vopadeva, son of the physician Kesava and protege of Hemadri 
(c. 1300), commented on the Sdrngadhara-samhitd, and wrote a 
Satasloki on powders, pills, etc. The use of opium and quicksilver 
in medicine and of pulse for diagnosis, which are referred to 
Persian or Arabic sources, are found in Sdrngadlnara. Rasaratna- 
samuchchaya, dealing with the science of Rasayana, elixirs, various¬ 
ly ascribed to Vagbhata, Asvimkumara or Nityanatha, has been 


488 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


assigned conjecturally to A.D. 1300. Rasendrasdrasamgraha by 
Gopalakrishna (fourteenth century) and Rasendrachintdmani by 
Ramachandra Guha (fourteenth century) are works on alchemy dur¬ 
ing this period. Trimalla, son of Vallabha, a Tailahga Brahmana 
who flourished between A.D. 1383 and 1499, wrote Yogatarahgim, 
a well-known collection of recipes, and P^asapradtpa, Pathydpathya- 
nighantu, V rittamdnikyamdld and Alamkdramnjari. Very late is 
the Bhdvaprakdsa (c. A.D. 1550) of Bhava Misra, and the Vaidya - 
jivana of Lolimbaraja. 

(viii) Astronomy and Astrology 

After the great Bhaskaracharya no one seems to have taken 
real interest in astronomy. His grandson Chahgadeva founded a 
school in 1205 to study his work, but it seems to have been inter¬ 
ested in astrology. Suryasiddhdnta-viveka or Vasanarnava by 
Madanapala is a commentary on the Surya-siddhdnta. Two works 
of not much importance are the Tithyddipatra of Makaranda 
(fifteenth century) and the Grahaldghava of Ganesa (sixteenth 
century). 

On an older astrological work is based the Vidydmddhaviya of 
early fourteenth century. More interesting than this is the Jyotir- 
vidabharana (sixteenth century), an astrological work wrongly 
ascribed to Kalidasa, the author of Sdkuntala, etc., which mentions 
the nine jewels adorning the court of Vikramaditya. Works on 
Muhurta gave auspicious moments for ceremonies, marriages, 
journeys, etc. Under the Arabic and Persian influence, however, 
were undertaken the later Tajikas like the one by Nilakantha (A.D. 
1587) in two parts—Samjna and Varsha-tantra. 

(ix) Polity 

There were not many works on the science of polity during this 
period. Mention may be made of Rdjamtiratndka.ra of Chandes- 
vara, 44 written at the command of king Bhavesa of Mithila. The 
book comprises sixteen chapters called tarangas, dealing with king, 
amdtyas, prddvwakas, sabhyas, forts, treasury, army, ambassadors, 
armies and spies, mandala , seven elements of state, heir apparent, 
etc. 


V. GENERAL REVIEW 

In concluding this survey, we may refer to some important 
contributions of this period to Sanskrit literature. The first thing 
that strikes one is the wonderful galaxy of celebrated commentators 
like Say ana, Mallinatha and Kataya Verna, who are the shining gems 


480 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


in Sanskrit commentary literature. There is nothing of note in 
Belles Letires except perhaps the abundance of Prabandhas and 
Sandesakavyas. 

There were outstanding productions like the Vwddachintdmani 
of Vachaspati Misra, Pavdsara-Madhaviya of Madhavacharya, and 
Smrititattva of Raghunandana in the Dharma-sastra literature. 
Special mention may be made of Madhava’s Sarvadarsanasamgraha, 
Raghunatha Siromani’s DIdhiti, the standard work on Navyanyaya, 
and the rise of the system of Vallabha Vedanta in the domain of 
philosophy. Important contributions were made to grammar, 
poetics and music. In grammar, the Saupadma system originated 
during this period; there were a number of well-known commenta¬ 
tors from Bengal; and Vaishnava grammars came to be written. The 
influence of Chaitanya was felt in grammar as well as in poetics. 
There were several important works on the science of music, which 
may be said to be the outstanding contribution of this period. 

B. SANSKRITIC 
I. LANGUAGE 

The date A.D. 1300 has been arbitrarily fixed, for convenience 
in discussing the subject, as the border line between Ancient and 
Early Medieval India and Late Medieval India. 

The first phase of Late Medieval India (1300-1526) roughly indi¬ 
cates the rule of Islamic States in North India prior to the estab¬ 
lishment of the Mughul power by Babur. With the foundation of 
the Mughul Empire about the middle of the sixteenth century A.D. 
we have the scond phase of Late Medieval India, the Mughul period, 
which covers the history of North India right down to the end of 
the 18th century, the Marathas gradually coming to the apogee of 
their power by the middle of that century. 

Before the close of the early medieval period, a great change 
had come over the greater part of Aryan-speaking India in the 
matter of its language. At the turn of the first millennium A.D., 
round about A.D. 1000, roughly most of the Aryan languages of 
India developed a new and quite a noteworthy phonetic character, 
which ushered in for most of them what may be described as the New 
Indo-Aryan stage in the development of the Aryan speech. Through 
the assimilation of consonant groups, Old Indo-Aryan changed into 
Middle Indo-Aryan shortly before the time of Gautama Buddha. The 
Aryan dialects of the North-West, corresponding to the Punjab and 
the Frontier Province, have always been a little conservative in the 
matter of sound-change, and while the rest of Aryan India (in the 


490 


SANSKRITIC LANGUAGE 


Ganga Valley and also in the regions to the south and south-west 
of the Gahga valley) had arrived at the characteristic Middle Indo- 
Aryan phonetic changes, by bringing about a general and wide¬ 
spread assimilation of conjunct consonants, the North-West resisted 
it. As we can see from the Asokan inscriptions, as late as the 3rd 
century B.C. the dialects of the North-West showed a great many 
Old Indo-Aryan characteristics, whereas in those of South-Western, 
Central, and Eastern tracts of Aryandom, the Middle Indo-Aryan 
habits were fully established. Through a series of changes begin¬ 
ning from roughly 600 B.C., the Aryan speech as a whole went on 
developing; and we have from 600 B.C. to A.D. 1000 a very note¬ 
worthy development of the Aryan speech. It is not necessary to 
enter into this linguistic history in detail. By A.D. 1000, the change 
which brought in the new stage, affecting most of the Aryan speeches 
of North India, was this: the double consonants or groups of a single 
stop followed by its corresponding aspirate, which had resulted from 
the assimilation in Middle Indo-Aryan of groups of diverse conso¬ 
nants of Old Indo-Aryan, were simplified—one consonant was 
dropped and as a compensation the previous vowel was lengthened. 
Thus Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) bhakta, tapta, Inasta, karma, sukla 
etc. became in Middle Indo-Aryan (Prakrit) respectively bhatta, 
tatta, hattha, kamma sukkha; and these underwent another great 
change round about A.D. 1000 when through the loss and compensa¬ 
tion mentioned above they became respectively bhdta, tata, hatha , 
kama and siika. 

A language does not change in a day. But we first note certain 
new tendencies, and then in the course of decades and centuries these 
tendencies go on gaining in power and affecting the language, which 
ultimately takes up a new form through these tendencies becom¬ 
ing well-established habits or linguistic characteristics. The trans¬ 
formation of the Middle Indo-Aryan into the New Indo-Aryan was 
not an abrupt one. From about the middle of the first millennium 
A.D., these tendencies were noticeable in the Middle Indo-Aryan, 
and then by about A.D. 800 we have a modification of the Middle 
Indo-Aryan or Prakrit into a definite Apabhramsa or late Middle 
Indo-Aryan, which represents the transition from the Middle to 
the New Indo-Aryan. While the changes were becoming established 
in the spoken language, the literary speech, which is generally con¬ 
servative in any country and has been particularly so in India, con¬ 
tinued to preserve the characteristics of an earlier age, so that we 
might say that Apabhramsa or the late Middle Indo-Aryan and the 
Early New Indo-Aryan coincided, throughout the greater part of 
Aryan India, from say A.D. 900 to A.D. 1300. During the first few 


491 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


centuries of the second millennium A.D., there is plenty of evidence 
that the New Indo-Aryan or Rhasha stage, with loss of one consonant 
and compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel, was already 
arrived at, but in the existing literary remains, it is largely the 
Apabhramsa speech, as current some centuries earlier, which was 
in general use. As we come towards A.D. 1300, the Apabhramsa 
characteristics get weaker and weaker, and the Bhasha or the New 
Indo-Aryan atmosphere becomes more and more firmly established. 
Already before 1300 we may say that the Modern Indo-Aryan 
languages had come into existence, and literary compositions in them 
had already started in some areas, though not everywhere. 

Round about A.D. 500 there were regional Prakrits which were 
the sources of the Modern Indo-Aryan languages: and we can think 
of these Prakrits mainly as:— 

1. An Eastern Prakrit or Magadhi; 

2. A Central Prakrit or Ardha-MagadhI; 

3. A Northern Prakrit, which may be called Khasa or Hima- 
lavan Prakrit; 

4. The SaurasenI Prakrit (the Midland Prakrit) as current in 
Western U. P. and parts of Eastern Punjab as well as of 
Rajasthan; 

5. Possibly a special Prakrit of Western Rajasthan, Saurashtra 
and Gurjara; 

6. A Prakrit embracing Northern and Western Punjab and 
Sind. This may be named Madra, Gandhara or Sindhu 
(Saindhavl) Prakrit; 

7. Possibly there was another Prakrit which was current in 
Malava. But it might have been just a variety of gaura- 
sem; and 

8. We have the Prakrit current in Maharashtra, which was at 
this time confined only to the northern districts of the pre¬ 
sent-day Maratha country. 

Then the Dardic Speech of Kashmir, not immediately descend¬ 
ed from Old Indo-Aryan, but rather from an intermediate group of 
Aryan speech standing in between Iranian and Indo-Aryan, was get¬ 
ting to be strongly influenced by the Prakrits of the plains of India. 

Round about A.D. 900, it would appear that these Prakrits had 
changed into the various Apabhramsas, for all of which we have 
not as yet been able to obtain specimens; there has been a great 
deal of loss of linguistic material in this connection. These Apa¬ 
bhramsas were: the Magadhi Apabhramsa, in several modified forms, 
current in Assam, Bengal and Orissa on the one hand and in Bihar 
and Eastern U.P. on the other; an Ardha-MagadhI Apabhramsa 


492 


SANSKRIT LITERATURE 


which was current in Kosala or Awadh and in the tracts to the 
south of that region right up to Maha-Kosala or the Chattisgarhi 
area. Connected with both Magadhl and Ardha-Magadhi Apa¬ 
bhramsa there was the intermediate Apabhramsa which seems to 
have been the source of the Halba dialect of Bastar. Then there 
was the Sauraseni Apabhramsa, the home of which was in Western 
U.P., and it influenced very largely the old Apabhramsa of Rajasthan, 
Gujarat and the Punjab, as well as Kosala, as it itself was being 
influenced by the Apabhramsa of the Punjab. Then we have a 
Punjab Apabhramsa which, in the eastern tracts of the Punjab, was 
strongly influenced by Sauraseni, while it remained purer in the 
west; we might call this Western Punjabi Apabhramsa the Kekaya 
Apabhramsa, from which the various Lahnda or Hindki dialects of 
Western Punjab originated. In Sind, the Western Apabhramsa be¬ 
came known as the Vrachada Apabhramsa. In Rajasthan we have 
the Rajastham-Gujamti Apabhramsa, to which the name of Nagara 
Apabhramsa may reasonably be given. Further south was the 
Maharashtrlya Apabhramsa. 

By the end of the Early Middle Xndo-Aryan stage, the above 
linguistic situation was further modified and we have the net and 
precise case of the Modern Indo-Aryan languages (Bhashias). The 
following Modern Indo-Aryan languages or groups of dialects had 
become established by 1300: 

(1) The Bengali-Assamese group, which appeared to have been 
almost virtually one language right down to A.D. 1500, although 
wide divergences in pronunciation and some innovations in grammar 
as well as vocabulary were creating a rift between the dialects of 
Bengal and the dialects of Assam, so that Assamese and Bengali 
finally came to be looked upon as distinct languages and not members 
of the same dialectal group, by A.D. 1500. 

(2) The Oriya language, which remained close to Bengali, but 
it had its own development as much as that for Bengali and Assamese. 

(3) Maithili: the speech of North Bihar—this became fully 
established by A.D. 1300. 

(4) Magahl: the speech of South Bihar, which was very close 
to Maithili, and although it had differentiated itself in many mat¬ 
ters, it did not create any literature except for a few compositions in 
very recent times. 

(5) Bhojpurl: this is an important language of Eastern India, 
and the oldest specimens that we have of this go back to the middle 
of the 15th century, in some of the poems of Kablr. 


493 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


(6) The Kosali dialects: these became differentiated later into 
its present-day descendants, Awadhi, Baghell and Chattisgarhi. Kosali 
appears to have been cultivated very early, and we have a Sanskrit 
work giving specimens of it—the Ukti-vyakti-prakarana, which is an 
attempt to teach Sanskrit through the Old Kosala speech and which 
goes back to the first half of the 12th century. 

(7) The Brajabhasha speech, with the connected Bundeli and 
Kanauji: this is current in Western U.P. and in parts of Raja¬ 
sthan and Madhya Pradesh; and because of its literary achievements 
Brajabhasha exerted a great influence on the dialects of Rajasthan 
and the Punjab. 

(8) Old Western Rajasthani, as a single speech, which later 
on, after A.D. 1500, became bifurcated into Western Rajasthani or 
Marwarl on the one hand and Gujarati on the other 1 (compare the 
case of a single Bengali-Assamese dialect-group differentiating itself 
into Bengali proper and Assamese proper after A.D. 1500, as noted 
above). 

(9) The SindhI speech derived out of the Old Vrachada 
Apabhramsa of Sind. 

(10) Finally, we have the incipient Punjabi language, mainly 
on a Western Punjabi basis. 

Then we have also Kashmiri as a Dardic speech, profoundly 
modified by Indo-Aryan, which was taking shape by 1300. 

Thus we have the following New Indo-Aryan languages well 
established by A.D. 1300: 

Assamese-Bengali, which may be taken as two languages, consi¬ 
dering that the political history of Assam and Bengal was quite inde¬ 
pendent of each other from very early times; Oriya; Maithili with 
Magahi as a wholly developed though connected dialect; Bhojpuri; 
Kosali or Awadhi, known also as Gahwari; Brajabhasha, with 
Kanauji and Bundeli, perhaps not yet fully differentiated; the Raja¬ 
sthani dialects, of which the most important was the Marwarl, 
largely used in literature; and Gujarati which went along with 
Marwarl; Marathi and the connected KonkanI dialects; and then 
Punjabi both Eastern and Western; and SindhI. 

Besides, there was a group of North Indian or Himalayan dia¬ 
lects, coming ultimately from Old Khasa Prakrit, of which we have 
no specimen until very late times. 

Excepting the Bengali-Assamese and Oriya on the one hand, 
and Marathi and Gujarati, as well as SindhI, and to some extent 
Punjabi, on the other, the speeches of the North Indian plains have 


494 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


had a very restricted literary employment during the last hundred 
years, and people speaking them have accepted, from the middle of 
the last century, and particularly from the beginning of the present 
one, a form of Western Hindi (the Khariboli speech of Delhi) as 
their language of education, literature and public life. This West¬ 
ern Hindi (Khariboli) has now acquired the generic name of Hindi, 
and at the present moment most of the languages classified above 
(e.g. Maithili, Magahi, Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Bagheli and Chattis- 
garhi, Brajabhasha with Bundeli and Kanauji, Malavi, Rajasthani) 
and the Central and Western Himalayan dialects in addition, are 
described as “dialects of Hindi.” But as a matter of fact, they are not 
dialects but independent languages, and were considered as such 
until about a hundred years ago. 


II. LITERATURE 

A. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS 

Just as the New Indo-Aryan languages which became estab¬ 
lished during this period were merely continuations of Old and 
Middle Indo-Aryan, so in the literature produced in them we have 
in a way a continuation of the traditions of Middle Indo-Aryan 
(Prakrit) as well as Sanskrit literatures. As in most early litera¬ 
tures, the subject-matter is mainly religious, largely Hindu or 
Brahmanical for the whole of North India, and to some extent Jain, 
as in Western India (in early Gujarati for example); in Bengal only 
we have survivals of Buddhist literature in its latest phases of the 
Mahayana school. The New Indo-Aryan literature started with in¬ 
heritances from Apabhrarhsa Prakrit and Sanskrit; and then, on the 
religious side, a Brahmanical revival, after the Turk! conquest and 
the cataclysm it involved during the 11th to 13th centuries had sub¬ 
sided, particularly in northern India, found its fullest expression in 
the literatures of the newly-born modern Indo-Aryan languages. 
There were also a number of local cults and religious movements 
(outside of the strictly Brahmanical movements based on Sanskrit 
scriptures) which were going strong. These were either submerged 
forms of Pre-Aryan religion which were rapidly becoming Brahma- 
nized, or were the effect of fresh developments within the Hindu 
fold, sometimes going counter to Brahmanical orthodoxy and Brah¬ 
manical claims of superiority; and these also were treated in the 
literature of North India of the period under review. 

The Indo-Aryan literature of the period 1300 to 1526 consists 
largely of great poems and of little lyrics; and they treated the 
heritage of ancient Indian myths and legends as well as philosophy, 


495 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


together with that of the local cults and creeds and of the new develop¬ 
ments mentioned above. On the whole, however, the atmosphere is 
that of the Vedanta, of the schools of Jnana, of Karma, of Yoga and, 
finally of Bhakti, among the great ideas and practices of Brahmanical 
philosophy and religion. Jain and Buddhist philosophy also had their 
places in the literature of some areas. The Rdmayana, the Maha- 
bhdrata and the Puvanas formed the general background of Early Indo- 
Aryan literature, just as the Bible , the Legends of the Saints and, 
later on, Graeco-Roman myths, legends, and history formed the back¬ 
ground of the early literatures of modern Europe. A knowledge of 
the ancient Indian background is thus indispensable for an apprecia¬ 
tion of the early medieval literature of North India. 

Cross divisions cannot be avoided in considering both subject- 
matter and treatment. A medieval French poet divided the 
subject-matter of French romance into three classes or groups: 

1. The Matter of Britain, 

2. The Matter of France, and 

3. The Matter of Rome, 

referring respectively to the Arthurian romances which evolved 
in Britain, the stories about Charlemagne and his circle which were 
largely French, and the classical world of ancient Rome and Greece 
which were available from Roman or Latin sources. Similarly, for 
early New Indo-Aryan literature, we see that on the side of story¬ 
telling—romances and narrative poetry—there were, to start with, 
two distinct Matter or Cycles in almost every linguistic area: 

1. The Matter or Cycle of Ancient India as preserved mainly 
in Sanskrit, and to some extent in Prakrit; and 

2. The Matter or Cycle of the province or linguistic area 
concerned, which may be called the Matter of Medieval India, which 
sometimes was found treated not in one language but in many, and 
was thus, in certain contexts, inter-provincial or pan-Indian. Some 
of the most distinctive or characteristic things in the different 
modern Indian literatures belonged to this Matter of Medieval India, 
which took shape from round about A.D. 1000 to 1300 or 1400. 

Then, from the 16th century onwards (which does not come 
within our purview), some of the North Indian languages like Hindu- 
sthanl or Hindi, and Bengali, Punjabi, and Sindhi, under the Muham¬ 
madan impact and inspiration, developed a new Matter or Cycle: 

3. The Matter of the Islamic World—Persia and Arabia; but 
as this belongs to a later period, we need not consider it here. 

Early literature in the modern Indian languages was either 
lyrical or narrative. The first deals, naturally enough, with love 


496 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


and other sentiments, or with religious devotion subjectively; and 
occasionally didactic and philosophical disquisitions and allegories 
as well as riddles would come under this, besides fragments of 
Spruche (subhashita ) literature. The second or the narrative type 
treated objectively mythical and traditional tales and themes from 
the Sanskrit epics and Puranas as well as stories from the lives of 
early medieval saints and heroes. In early Bengali literature these 
two types were respectively known as pada (lyric) and mangala 
(narrative or story, particularly of a religious implication or applica¬ 
tion). 

The Matter of Ancient India in early modern Indian literature 
need not detain us. This consists of adaptations or translations, 
which most languages show in verse, of the Rdmdyana , the Maha- 
hhdrata, the Bhdgavata and other Puranas, besides some of the other 
great books of Brahmanism, which formed the Bible of the Hindu 
masses all over the country. These translations or adaptations in 
the various languages kept the Hindu tradition alive among the 
people. The lives of the Jain, Vaishnava and other saints of ancient 
and medieval times also form part of this Matter of Ancient India, 
in so far as their inheritance goes back to times before A.D. 1000. 
The movement to translate or adapt, in the languages of the people, 
the Rdmdyana , the Mahdbhdrata, the Puranas and other texts of 
Brahmanical Hinduism, which we note all over India, may be looked 
upon as part of a sort of Hindu or Bramanical renaissance through 
a resuscitation of Sanskrit literature. This was noticeable, after 
the establishment of the Turk! rule, as a defensive movement for the 
Hindu religion, and this revival was noticed particularly from the 
15th century onwards. Later on, the Muslim rulers, both of Indian 
and foreign origin, also participated in this revivalistic movement, 
either as a matter of policy, or for literary and aesthetic satisfac¬ 
tion. The renderings of the Sanskrit epics, Puranas and other texts, 
which started immediately after things got settled down after the 
welter and turmoil of the Turk! conquest, now form a common in¬ 
heritance for the whole of Aryan India (and also for Dravidian 
India), and it is an inheritance of the most far-reaching importance 
in the literatures of modern Indian languages, forming the most effec¬ 
tive common platform for them all. 

The Matter of Medieval India consists of different cycles of 
romantic or heroic stories which had their origin from the time of 
the rise of the New Indo-Aryan languages and literatures. Thus 
we have in Bengal the cycle of stories relating to Lausena, the hero 
(in the Dharma-Mangala romances), of Bihula and Lakshmindhara 
and the Snake Goddess (in the Manasd-Mangala or the Padma 

497 

D.S.—32 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Pur ana poems), and of the merchant Dhanapati, his wives Khullana 
and Lahana and his son iSrlmanta, as well as to the stories of the 
huntsman Kalaketu and his wife Phullara (the Chandi-Mahgala 
poems)'; in Orissa we have stories about the kings of Orissa, particu¬ 
larly the highly romantic story of King Purushottama Deva and 
Princess Padmavatl, which originated in the 15th century; in the 
AwadhI area a number of romantic tales, which were treated specially 
by the early Muslim writers of AwadhI, beginning from the end of 
the 14th century, formed the most characteristic literary output of 
this speech; so in Rajasthan and the North Indian Rajput world, we 
have a series of noble stories of Rajput romance and chivalry which 
were treated in poems in Rajasthani (Diiigal or Middle Mar war!) and 
in Brajabhasha as well as in Bundell forms of Western Hindi. Pun¬ 
jabi also had its romantic stories; and in the Maratba country its 
ballads ( powddds ) relating to the heroes of the Maharashtrian 
national upsurge in the seventeenth century came later. 

Certain literary genres were well established in the North 
Indian languages. One is the Buraha-masiya poems describing in a 
series of pictures, so to say, for the twelve months of the year, the 
sufferings of the lovers pining through separation, or their happiness 
in the joys of union. Another is the Chautisd poems with initials of 
the lines consisting of the 34 consonants in the Indian alphabet com¬ 
ing one after the other, similarly describing the pangs or joys of sepa¬ 
ration or union, as well as the praise of the divinities. The Persian 
practice of putting in the name of the composer of a lyric at the end 
of it, as a sort of signature or seal of authorship, also came to be 
established in India during this period. But this medieval device 
has been abandoned in most of the languages, although poets of Urdu, 
Hindi and Punjabi still take pleasure in sporting a Takhallus or 
Upandm. 

Indo-Aryan literature during this period was fundamentally 
the literature of poetry, and prose was very rarely cultivated dur¬ 
ing these centuries. There are nevertheless certain prose works, 
particularly in early Rajasthanl-Gujaratl, which had a definite prose 
style established in the fourteenth century. Prose came in later 
in Assamese and in (Western) Punjabi, but it was very much restrict¬ 
ed in most of the other languages. 

The vast open plains of North India made possible, as in the 
earlier centuries, the passage of literary ideas, themes, and types 
from one corner of the country to the other, so that a story which 
originated in Bengal passed into the Punjab and Maharashtra, and 
vice versa. Sometimes compositions in the different languages 
travelled from one part of the country into another, and with some 


498 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


very little change they could easily be made to look like original 
compositions in another language. The basic agreement among the 
modern Indian languages made it quite an easy affair; and so long as 
they could understand what was intended to be conveyed, people 
did not mind—they were never sticklers about the purity of the lan¬ 
guage or dialect, its grammar or its vocabulary. 

The range of early modern Indian literature, however, was 
rather limited, if we compare it with that of the great classical 
literatures of the past, or with the modern literatures. But on the 
whole, this range was not in any way less wide than what we find 
in contemporary Islamic and early medieval European literatures 
(excepting, of course, the literature of science which characterized 
Arabic). The expansion of Indian literature in introducing various 
new types of subject-matter took place much later. 

The Apabhramsa tradition in literature was not abandoned 
entirely. Jain scholars particularly kept it up by composing newer 
and newer works in Apabhramsa, more as a literary or linguistic 
exercise than anything else. The Apabhramsa work on metre, which 
is also an Apabhrariisa anthology of lyric verses, namely, the 
Prakrit a-Paihg ala, was finally redacted towards the end of the 15th 
century, when we are in the broad daylight of the New Indo-Aryan 
languages. 


B. INDIVIDUAL WORKS 

We may next take into consideration some of the important 
works which were composed in the various new Indo-Aryan 
languages during the period 1300-1526. 

1. Hindi 

(a) Western Hindi 

The Khariboii form of Hindi, which has been accepted by the 
Indian Constitution as the Official Language of India, is one of the 
youngest of the Indian languages. As a matter of fact, it did not 
come into literary use in any appreciable scale before A.D. 1800, 
and its effective literary employment started only after 1850. But 
when we use, in a narrow and strictly scientific sense, the expression 
“Hindi literature”, we mean by it primarily the literature in Braja- 
bhasha and other Western Hindi speeches, particularly Brajabhasha, 
the most important form of Western Hindi prior to 1850. It is custo¬ 
mary to include in this expression Awadhl (Kosali) also, although 
Awadhi is genetically of a different Prakrit origin from Western 
Hindi. Then, again, we have to consider the mixture of various dia-

lects which was steadily developing as a literary language, being 
particularly in use among the wandering religious preachers ( sants 
and stidhus) who were in early medieval times moving all over Nor¬ 
thern India, preaching the special religious ideologies for which they 
stood—a kind of monotheistic mysticism, as in the case of a saint like 
Kabir and his followers; the doctrine of Bhakti through faith in Rama 
or Krishna, incarnations of Vishnu, as preached by other saints; and 
yoga practices with elements from other cults, such, for instance, as 
were preached by Natha-panthi Yogins, among whom the greatest 
teacher was Gorakha-natha. This composite sadhu speech, mainly on 
a Braja basis, with forms and words from the early speech of the 
Delhi area and of the Eastern Punjab, was also found in the writ¬ 
ings of the Sikh gurus of the Punjab. The devotional songs of Mira 
Bai, written originally in Rajasthani, as well as the mass of Rajput 
romances written in Dingal or Old Marwari, and other verses in 
Dingal, are also now considered as forming part of “Hindi 
Literature”. In recent years Bhojpuri, Maithill and Bihari speeches, 
as well as Garhwali, Kumaoni and other speeches of the Himalayas 
have been brought under the tutelage of Khariboli Hindi. 

During the period A.D. 1000 to 1300, Western Hindi and other 
speeches, as has been said before, were evolving out of Apabhramsa. 
The Apabhramsa literary tradition was still going strong, and writers 
would be using either the older type of language (Apabhramsa) or 
the new Indian vernaculars as they were developing, like Old Braja- 
bhasha, Old Awadhi, Old Bengali and the rest, at their choice. It 
was during this period of a kind of linguistic hesitancy, that the 
first drafts of great Rajput heroic romances like the Prithvirdja - 
rdsau, the Visala-deva-rasau, the Khumdna-rdsau, the Alha-Udal 
romance of Jaganik, and some other works took shape. These were 
in later centuries very much extended. They were mostly in vari¬ 
ous forms of Western Hindi, with a strong SaurasenI Apabhramsa 
background, and they stand at the base of what may be described 
as “Hindi Literature”, as also of Rajasthani literature. There were 
some great Saiva Yogins like Gorakha-natha (c. A.D. 1150), la who, in 
a way, represent a combination of various traditions. These old tradi¬ 
tions were later on (with some influence from Islamic Sufism) fur¬ 
ther developed by a poet-saint like Kabir. Kabir’s predecessors 
came into the field of Apabhramsa and New Indian literature prior 
to 1300. Their contributions also formed an important background 
for later Hindi literature. The Brahman scholars were busy, com¬ 
posing works in Sanskrit, both stories and philosophical works, as 
well as light poetry. But the full Brahmanical revival on the basis 
of translations from the epics and the Puranas was to come later.

SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


The first two centuries after the Turk! conquest and the esta¬ 
blishment of a Turk! ruling house in Delhi and elsewhere, were not 
conducive to the growth of literature. The conquest may be said 
to have proceeded with all its ruthlessness and destructiveness from 
the end of the 10th to the middle of the 13th century, and even 
later. By the middle of the 13th century, it was found that the Turk 
had come to stay, and the Indian Muslim as a distinct and a new 
element in the population came into being. The Indian Muslim, 
to start with, was a foreigner, and adopted India as his country, 
and then he took his wife from among the native people. Thus there 
came into being the strong group of mixed peoples, and this was fur¬ 
ther reinforced by conversions into Islam from among the Hindu 
masses, and in some cases from among the princely families also. 
The foreign element gradually became absorbed into the basic Indian 
element. The Turki conquistadores followed the method of violence 
in conquering and killing and looting and converting the Hindus. 
This did not prove effective—it only stiffened up Hindu resistance 
to the hated Turk and his religion. The Sufi preachers, on the 
other hand, moving among the Hindu masses and living among them, 
followed far different methods, and they were successful both in 
gaining converts to Islam and in obtaining a spiritual rapproche¬ 
ment w 7 ith the Hindus. The result of this was some new religious 
developments in India. The Turki way (Turkanah tariqah) failed, 
where the Sufi way (Sufiyanah tariqah ) succeeded. At the com¬ 
mencement of this period we find Amir Khusrav (1253-1325), who 
was a most remarkable person as a scholar, a mystic (Sufi) and a 
poet. His father was an immigrant Turk, a foreign Muslim, and 
his mother an Indian Muslim lady of Turkish origin. He was a 
finished Persian scholar and wrote a number of poems and romances 
in Persian, and he is looked upon as the greatest Persian poet of 
India. He knew Arabic, and was one of the earliest writers of Hindi 
as well; and he was fully alive to the importance of Hindi 
even in front of Persian and Arabic. He was very proud of his 
“Hindi” heritage, and it is just possible that by Hindi he meant 
Sanskrit also. But the actual mass of Hindi compositions attributed 
to him is quite small, consisting only of a few riddles and of maca¬ 
ronic verses giving a combination of Hindi and Persian words and 
phrases. These riddles are beautifully expressed in fine poetic Hindi. 
The manuscript tradition of the Hindi writings of Khusrav is not 
certain, and it is likely that the language has been to some extent 
modernized. But we can be sure that he was among the first writers 
to use the New Indo-Aryan Old Western Hindi, which was a Khariboli 
speech of Hindi mixed with Brajabhasha as a living language, and not 
the earlier Apabhramsa. Amir Khusrav is also the reputed author of 


501 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the Khaliq-Bafi , which is a brief dictionary, in verse, of Perso-Arabic 
and Hindi, and students of Persian used to get it by heart; this book 
did a great service in the spread of Perso-Arabic words among the 
people of North India, and so it helped to bring about the develop¬ 
ment of Urdu. 

A contemporary of Khusrav was the song-composer Gopal 
Nayak. Some of his Dhrupad songs, in Brajabhasha, are still cur¬ 
rent. After Amir Khusrav Khvaja Bandah-Nawaz Glsu-dariaz 
(1321-1422), a Muslim Sufi, who lived in the Daccan, was the first 
writer of the Dakhrii, or Deccan Hindi under Muslim Sufi inspiration. 
His book in DakhnI Hindi, the Mir’at-uWAshiqin, which is in prose 
and deals with Sufiism, and is replete with Arabic and Persian words, 
is looked upon as the earliest work in the Urdu form of Hind 1 !. 

Between A.D. 1300 to 1400, we do not find any other writer of 
Hindi, though compilation of Apabhramsa texts and their study, 
and literary endeavour in a mixture of Rajasthani and Apabhramsa 
as well as in Brajabhasha, appear to have continued in the courts 
of the Rajput chiefs of Rajasthan and North India generally. The 
Muslim princes had no use for Apabhramsa, and the impetus towards 
writing largely in the living languages of the day might reasonably 
have come from the Muslim aristocracy. There is, however, at least 
one poem in rather ornate Apabhramsa, the Sandesa-msaka, by a poet 
named ‘Abdur-Rahman (which name he has turned into Apabhramsa 
as Addahamana), who flourished in the South Punjab in the 12th or 
13th century. lb But Hindi literature during the 15th century is domi¬ 
nated by Kabir, or Sant Kabir Das, whose traditional dates of birth 
and passing away are 1399 and 1518, he being credited with a very 
long life of 119 years. 2 

Kabir is unquestionably one of the greatest saints and mystics 
of India and the world. Born in an Indian Muslim family of humble 
origin, of people who were weavers by profession, he is said to 
have received his spiritual initiation from Ramiananda, the saintly 
devotee of Vaishnavism, in the city of Banaras, which was also 
Kablr’s native place. Kabir was a religious mystic and saint, and 
his approach to God was through the path of knowledge as well 
as devotion, his God being an Absolute Being without an earthly 
incarnation and a personal form. This aspect of his teachings he 
got from the Natha-panth! tradition as preserved by the Yoga 
School of Gorakha-natha. But this approach to a God without attri¬ 
butes—a Nirguna Brahman —was suffused with a highly emotional 
quality of love also. Herein Kabir was influenced by two strains of 
religious perception—the Indian Bhakti or faith, and the Sufi ‘Ishq 
or love. 


502 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


The abandon of faith in and love of God was a new strain in 
Indian religious experience for which Hinduism is indebted to the 
Dravidian South. The Saints of the Tamil country, whether the 
Saivite Ndyanmdrs or Chittars (i.e. Siddhas), or Vaishnava Alvars 
or devotees, 3 who flourished roughly during the second half of the 
first millennium A.D., were distinguished by a deep and all absorb¬ 
ing love for God and a self-abnegation, whether God appeared to 
them in the form of Siva or in the form of Vishnu. This feeling 
of self-effacing love for the Deity as the only ultimate and effective 
means of realization forms the basis of the Bhakti school. In the 
Sri sect of the Tamil scholar and saint Ramanuja (c. A.D. 1050), this 
Bhakti for God in the form of Vishnu or his incarnations on earth 

like Rama and Krishna was inculcated. The Bhakti doctrine was 

• • 

brought to the North, and Ramananda, 4 probably a native of Bana- 
ras, was a teacher of the order of Ramanuja in the 14th-15th centu¬ 
ries, and he preached devotion to Vishnu in the form of Rama. 
From him Kablr evidently derived the Bhakti side of his spiritual 
personality. From the Sufis, to whom he had access, as one belong¬ 
ing to a Muslim group, he got his idea of romantic love for the 
Divine Being as a personal deity. But whereas with the Sufis God 
is the Great Beloved and man is the lover, it was different with 
Kablr. God, with Kablr, is the Supreme Male, the Purushottama 
in orthodox Hindu parlance, and human souls, are, as it were, the 
brides of God. This is in accordance with the traditions of the 
followers of Krishna in Hinduism. 

Kablr was a great apostle of the unity of faiths in the higher 
plane of true knowledge and of love of God. He preached to both 
Hindus and Muslims of his time the need to rise above the accidentals 
of the professed religion, and to think of the essentials which are 
the same everywhere. God he named both as Rama, the Hindu 
name (he made it clear that by Rama, which meant, “One in Whom 
we get joy”, Kablr did not mean, as most Hindus did, the incarna¬ 
tion of Vishnu, who came down on earth as Rama, as the son of 
Dasaratha and husband of Slta, but only the Supreme Being without 
any form) and as Rahim, the Muslim name (meaning “the Supremely 
Merciful One”). In Kablr we might say that the true spirit of 
Hinduism which is also found in Muslim Suflism, in seeking the 
essential Unity in the midst of Diversity, found a most beautiful 
expression. The poetic charm of Kablr’s mystic poems is ineffable. 
He is credited with a large number of works, all in verse, but among 
these the Bijaka or “the Seed Book” and the Bdnis or “Message 
Poems” are the most important. The ideology of Sikh faith of 
Guru Nanak (1469-1539) and his successors was basically of the same 


503 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


school of thought as Kabir’s, and quite a large number of Kabir’s 
poems have found a place in the Adi-Grantha of the Sikhs, which 
is a collection (made in 1604 by Arjun, the fifth Guru of the Sikhs) 
of devotional and mystic poems by the Sikh Gurus or teachers and 
by some others who preceded them and were represented as Bhagats 
(Bhaktas ) or lovers of God. 

Kabir belonged to the Bhojpuri area, being of Banaras, and 
the current mass of poems as attributed to Kabir probably do not 
represent the original language in which he wrote. Some poems 
by Kabir in pure Bhojpuri have been found; others, as it has been 
shown by Dr. Uday Narayan Tiwari, were originally composed in 
Bhojpuri, but their language was changed to a mixed speech com¬ 
posed of Brajabhasha, Khariboli and Awadhi which characterizes 
the bulk of his extant writings. His language may be said to be 
a composite speech in which Brajabhasha and the Delhi speech have 
joined hands, and this is the reason his writings could have universal 
popularity all over North India, from the Punjab to Bihar. 

Guru Nanak is to be mentioned with Kabir, although younger 
by three generations. He and his disciples carried on Kabir’s tradi¬ 
tion of the earlier Bhakti School in the Punjab; and Guru Nanak 
and his followers also had contact with the Muslim Sufis of the 
Punjab. The oldest of these Punjab Sufis, Baba Farld-ud-din Ganj- 
i-shakar (1175-1265) of Multan and Pak-Pattan, may be described 
as a true predecessor of Kabir, judging from the form and content 
of the two poems left by him which have a place in the Adi-Grantha 
and which are among the oldest compositions available in a kind 
of Hindi. 

Contemporaneous with Kabir (North India) as well as Guru 
Nanak (Punjab) and also with Chaitanya (Bengal), was Vallabha- 
charya (1479-1531). 5 Originally a Telugu Brahman from the Dec- 
can, he settled at Vrindavana, and became a great teacher of the 
Bhakti doctrine, and inculcated the worship of God in the form of 
Krishna. Through Vallabhacharya’s influence, a school of poets 
dealing with the story of Krishna with a devotional background 
developed in Vrindavana and Mathura, and they composed primarily 
in the Brajabhasha speech. The greatest of these Vaishnava poets 
of the Krishna cult in Brajabhasha was Suradasa, who probably 
flourished from c. 1483 to 1563 and whose floruit therefore goes be¬ 
yond the lower limit of the period under review. We need not dis¬ 
cuss his successors—the celebrated group of poets known as the 
Ashta-Chdpa of Mathura and Vrindavana. Mira Bal was another 
Vaishnava devotee—a poetess of the Bhakti School, and she lived 
round about 1492-1546. Her compositions (originally in Rajasthani, 


504 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


now largely changed to Brajabhasha and Khariboli as well as in¬ 
to Gujarati) mostly belong to the next period of Indian literature. 
This virtually exhausts most of the important literary compositions 
in Western Hindi up to 1526. 

(b) Kosall or Awadhi or the so called “Eastern Hindi” 

At the present moment there is very little literary endeavour 
in Awadhi or Kosall, and its speakers have mostly adopted the 
modern Khariboli or Standard Hindi as their language of education, 
literature and public life. But there are here and there a few 
apologists for Awadhi, and occasionally songs and poems are com¬ 
posed in it. But Awadhi has been one of the earliest New Indo- 
Aryan languages to be cultivated for literature. The oldest speci¬ 
mens of Awadhi we find in the Ukti-vyakti-prakarana of Damodara 
Pandita who flourished during the first half of the 12th century. 6 
He wrote this book to teach Sanskrit through his mother-tongue, 
which was a kind of Old Awadhi, about four hundred years before 
the time of Tulsidasa. This book gives quite an interesting number 
of Old Awadhi words and phrases as well as sentences and proverbs 
from Old Awadhi. After the Turki conquest, the Muse of Kosali 
was silent for two centuries, and then from the end of the fourteenth 
century literary compositions in Awadhi started again. The oldest 
fragments of a romantic poem called Chandayana in Awadhi, by a 
Muslim writer, Maulana Daud, goes back to 1370. These fragments 
relate to the story of the hero Lorik (or Lor) and the heroine 
Chanda, a popular romantic tale in North India during the medieval 
period, which travelled as far east as Bengal. 7 The Sufi tradition, 
which became established in India in the 14th century, found a 
series of writers mostly Muslim, who beginning with Maulana 
Baud, probably the first poet in this line, took successively a num¬ 
ber of romantic tales of medieval Hindu inspiration, and wove them 
into beautiful allegorical poems in Awadhi . The manuscripts of 
these poems in Awadhi are mostly in the Persian character, although 
their language is pure Awadhi; this is due to the strong Muslim 
Sufi atmosphere in which these compositions were made. There 
were three important poets in this tradition in the sixteenth century, 
who all used the early Awadhi language. The oldest was Kutban, 
who lived as a protege of the Sultan of Jaunpur in Eastern U.P. 
He was a disciple of the Sufi teacher of the Chisti order named 
Shaikh Burhan, and in A.D. 1501 he composed his Mrigdvati which 
has already been published. It is a pure Rajput romance, and the 
allegorical elements in it are slight. Another poet, Manihan, lived 
after Kutban, and his Madhu-Malatl (composed before 1532) has 
been found only in an incomplete form. Here in this poem is a 


505 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


greater play of fancy, more imagination and a deeper allegory of 
life than in Kutban’s work. In spite of its incomplete form, it is 
one of the best works of imagination written in North India. In the 
AwadhI tradition came a number of important poets after Manjhan, 
but they belonged to the period beyond 1526. 

2. Rajasthani 

The literature in Rajasthani is now being studied with deep in¬ 
terest and application by a number of Rajasthani scholars. The 
early literature of Rajasthani consisted of heroic ballads, songs, and 
dohds or couplets in an old form of Marwari, which was known as 
Dingal , and this language was not much different from the Gujarati 
of the present day. Hence we have to take up Early Rajasthani 
(specially Marwari) and Early Gujarati together. The period of this 
Old Western Rajasthani, as this common basis or source language of 
both Gujarati and Rajasthani has been called, comes down to about 
1550, and specific Rajasthani works in the late form of Rajasthani 
therefore belong to the period after 1550. The romantic and heroic 
poem Kdnhada-de Prabandha (see under Gujarati below) has been 
claimed equally by Rajasthani and Gujarati. Mira Bai, mentioned 
above, is claimed by Gujarati, Rajasthani and Hindi. She was a 
princess of a Rajput kingly house in Rajasthan, and her poems, as 
we have them, are mostly in Rajasthani. But their language has 
been altered to look like Hindi in the North and to approximate with 
Gujarati in the South. 


3. Himalayan Dialects 

The Himalayan dialects consisting of Early Nepali, which was 
confined to Western Nepal before the middle of the 18th century, 
Garhwali and Kumaoni, which might have been a single speech 500 
years ago, as well as the various Himalayan dialects of the Western 
group extending from Garhwal and Kumaon to Chamba and 
Kashmir, have not preserved any specimen which can be relegated 
to our period under review. 

4. Punjabi 

Punjabi at the present day is found in two forms: Eastern 
Punjabi which is now used primarily for literary purposes and runs 
close to Hindi, and Western Punjabi or Lahndi or Hindki dialects. 
While a literary speech has developed in the eastern Punjab during 
the last 200 years, Western Punjabi has not been so fortunate, and 
the language has split up into a number of dialects without any 
literary cohesion at the present moment, and W T estern Punjabi 
speakers, if they write Punjabi at all, now take to Eastern Punjabi. 


506 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


The oldest specimens of vernacular poetry written by a poet of 
the Punjab are two devotional compositions attributed to Baba 
Farld-ud-dln Ganj-shakar of Multan and Pak-Pattan. But the 
language is not Punjabi of any sort. Punjabi has always been 
dominated by the Midland Speech, both in its form and in its 
literary ideas. We do not have any authentic specimen of pure 
Punjabi literature, whether of West or of East Punjab, for the period 
under review. The oldest book that we have in Punjabi at the pre¬ 
sent day is a prose biography of Guru Nanak known as the Janam - 
Sdkhl, which is attributed to one of the disciples of Guru Nanak, 
namely Bala. This was supposed to have been written shortly after 
Guru Nanak’s death, about 1538. The Adi-Grantha was compiled 
first in 1604 by Guru Arjun, but here the language primarily is 
Brajahhasha mixed with Kosall, with occasional Punjabi forms in 
some of the poems. 


5. Sindhi 

Sindh! appears to have had a rich ballad literature of Hindu 
origin which perhaps goes back to Apabhramsa times. There is 
evidence for the existence of a version of the Mahabharata story and 
some Puranic tales in the Apabhramsa of Sind prior to A.D. 1000. 
Some of the most beautiful and most characteristic Sindhi ballads, 
like those relating to Dalu-Rai, to Udero-lal (the incarnation of 
Varuna, the god of the Sindhu river), and to heroes and heroines who 
belong to the Sumra dynasty dominant in Sind from about the 
eleventh (or somewhat later) to the fourteenth century (like king 
Bhungar and his sons Duda or Dodo and Chanesar i.e. Chandresvara 
—the latter is the hero of the beautiful ballad relating to his devoted 
wife Lila and to the maiden Kaunro who loved him, about whom 
there is a Persian poem going back to the days of Akbar), and to 
Momul and Rano, and similar other ballads undoubtedly go back to 
the period 1300 to 1526. 7a The Apabhramsa of Sind, namely the 
Vrachada Apabhramsa, is well known. Specimens of a few Sindhi 
words and verses are all that are available for our period. Yet 
modern Sindhi is one of the most archaic among the Indo-Aryan 
languages. The most outstanding writer of Sindhi is a Muslim Sufi 
saint, Shah Latlf, who died in A.D. 1748. 

6. Gujarati 

The literature of Gujarati, on the other hand, is something which 
presents quite an embarras de richesse . From the heyday of Apa¬ 
bhramsa literature Gujarati presents an unbroken literary tradition 
right down to our day, and the Jain writers had a very great place in 
the development of Gujarati language and literature. Gujarati 


507 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


literature in its earlier history could be conveniently divided into two 
periods: Old Gujarati period from about A.D. 1000 to about A.D. 
1450, and Early Middle Gujarati from 1450 to the Mughul conquest. 

Hemachandra, the erudite Jain scholar, saint and grammarian of 
Gujarat (1088-1173), collected over 100 couplets in the Apabhramsa 
of his time as the language which was used like the vernacular, and 
these are claimed by both Hindi (Brajabhasha and Khariboli) and by 
Marwarl, as well as by Gujarati, as specimens of their earlier forms. 
During the second half of the 14th century, Nemichandra Bhandari 
composed 160 gathas on the Jain faith on which two prose commen¬ 
taries in early Gujarati dating between 1550 to 1560 have been found. 
Folk tales current in Gujarat, Marwar and Malwa were written in 
early Gujarati prose during this age, and they were compiled in books 
called Baltivabodhas or “Instructions to the Youth”. Tarunaprabha, 
a Jain monk, composed one such Bdlavabodha about A.D. 1355 which 
is one of the oldest authentic works in Gujarati. 

Jain writers were not the only persons to cultivate the field of 
Old Gujarati literature. A number of old prose works and chronicles 
of Brahmanical origin are found, as well as some highly ornate poems. 
One such poem is the Vasanta-vildsa, a description of the spring, of 
unknown Brahmanical (non-Jain) authorship, which was composed 
about A.D. 1350. This book bears a close impress of the Glta-Govinda 
of Jayadeva, and it is a charming poem in both the mellifluousness of 
its language and the gorgeousness of its description. The Parsis who 
settled in Gujarat began to render their scriptures from Avestan and 
Pahalvi into Sanskrit in the thirteenth century, and then into Gujarati 
in the fourteenth century, as Gujarati had long before that become 
their home language. 

Among the Old Gujarati works may be mentioned poems like 
Ranamalla-chhanda, Ushd-harana, Sltd-harana and Prabodha-chintd- 
mani; and a work in ornate prose, the Prithvt-chandra-charitra of 
unknown authorship, composed before 1422, which is a sort of prose 
romance relating to a prince: it is a unique work of its kind. 

The Old Gujarati style or tradition in prose and poetry con¬ 
tinued right down to the beginning of the sixteenth century, a 
century and a half after a new tradition ushering in Middle Gujarati 
was established. Thus we have the Kanhada-de-Prabandha of 
Padmanabha, composed early in the sixteenth century, which 
describes the fight by the last Hindu king of Gujarat with the Mus¬ 
lims under ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl. From Delhi he came down and 
attacked Gujarat and conquered the province from Raja Karna (Karan 
Gahelo or Ghelo). 8 It is a spirited heroic tale which, because of its 
archaic language, is not so popular as it should be, although it has 


508 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


been rendered into modern Gujarati. Manuscripts of this work 
have been found both in Gujarati and Rajasthani, and it is also claim¬ 
ed as part of Rajasthani literature, scholars in Rajasthani having 
brought out a new edition of this work to match the earlier editions 
by the Gujarati scholars. 

Narasimha Mehta (1415-1481) ushered in a new era in Gujarati 
literature by introducing the Bhakti School which was then effect¬ 
ing quite a transformation of the literatures in the New Indo- 
Aryan languages. He was, like the other bhaktas , against the 
abuses of caste system which he wanted to break, and composed his 
devotional lyrics in honour of God conceived in the form of Krishna. 
He was the first great poet of Gujarat who still lives in the memories 
and in the lives of the Gujarati speakers. 

Narasimha Mehta was for Vedanta based on jnana or knowledge, 
and for bhakti or faith in God, and in his spiritual ideas he appears to 
have been influenced by both the North Indian poets and saints and 
the saints of Maharashtra like Jnanadeva and Namadeva (13th to 14th 
centuries A.D.). Narasimha Mehta’s religio-social work, through his 
lyrics, particularly in the Jhulana metre, is based on the teachings of 
the saint and sage VishnusvamI of Karnataka; and his literary-spiri¬ 
tual ministration preceded that of Vallabhacharya, who and his 
followers (fifteenth-sixteenth centuries) in Gujarat introduced the 
new Pushti-marga school of Vaishnavism. Considerably after Nara¬ 
simha Mehta was Mira Bai, the saint-poetess of Rajasthan who has 
been mentioned above. 

Bhalana (fifteenth century) wrote the story of Krishna, as in the 
tenth chapter of the Bhagavata Purdna, in short lyrics, in Gujarati 
and occasionally in Brajabhasha, showing a strong influence of his 
great contemporary, the Brajabhasha poet Suradasa. In the latter 
part of his work he followed the style of the earlier dkhydnas or the 
mythological narrative tales in Gujarati. 

Vallabha Mewado (sixteenth century) celebrated the Mother 
Goddess in her benign aspect. From the sixteenth century, the 
school of the Vaishnava saint Vallabhacharya, the founder of the 
Pushti-marga school of Bhakti, became a great force in Gujarati life 
and literature, and poets of this school began to manifest themselves 
in large numbers in Gujarat. 

7. Marathi 

The history of the Marathi language goes back to about A.D. 
1000. But the earliest writers, whose works are extant in more or 
less authentic forms, belong to the second half of the 13th century. 
Marathi is a Prakritic speech standing rather by itself, and the con- 


509 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


nected KonkanI dialects show some special features of agreement 
with the North Indian Aryan speeches. 

The death of Namadeva, in A.D. 1350, marks the end of a flourish¬ 
ing period of Marathi literature. 9 The next two centuries—a period 
of transition—are sometimes described as the dark period of this lite¬ 
rature. As noted above, there were since A.D. 1294 almost continuous 
fights between the Muslims and the Marathi speaking people, lead¬ 
ing to the gradual establishment of Muslim rule in Maharashtra. The 
country was suffering from war and famine, and steady literary pro¬ 
gress was not possible. The Mahanubhava sect, which at first became 
unpopular through some concessions granted to it by the new Muslim 
rulers of Maharashtra, gradually recovered some of its old prestige, 
and as all Hindu sects were suffering from Muslim apathy and hosti¬ 
lity, a rapprochement among them in a general adversity gradually 
took place. The honour paid to the mythical sage Dattatreya by the 
Mahanubhava sect spread also to the followers of the Viarakari 
school. Among teachers and writers of this age of transition were 
N'arasimha Sarasvatl and Janardana Svami, the master of Ekanatha, 
both of the Varakari sect. Poems of a devotional nature ascribed 
to them are still current among the people. A disciple of Narasimha 
Sarasvatl wrote in verse the history of the sage-god Dattatreya, 
known as the Guru-charita, and this work is held in great esteem 
by both Varakaris and Mahanubhavas. 

8. Bengali 

We now come to the modern Indo-Aryan languages of the East, 
namely Bengali, Assamese, Oriya } Maithili, Magahl and Bhojpuri. 
These are all descended from the old MagadhI Prakrit of Eastern 
India and possess some common traits. 

Among these Bengali is the language of the largest number and 
its modern literature is quite remarkable in quality as well as quan¬ 
tity. Reference has been made above to the oldest specimens of 
Bengali literature dating roughly from A.D. 1050 to 1200. 10 This 
is followed by a period of transition from 1200 to 1350, which is not 
represented by any authentic specimens of literature. It is, how¬ 
ever, very likely that the first drafts, so to say, of the great Middle 
Bengali narrative poems on stories specially connected with Bengal— 
what may be called “the Matter of Bengal”—were made during this 
period. The story of the deathless love of Bihula for her husband 
Lakshmlndhara, the adventures of Lausena, the story of the mer¬ 
chant Dhanapati and of his son Srimanta, and of Kalaketu and Phul- 
lara, were probably current in popular narrative poems sung by a 
special class of ballad-singers, whose performances continued for a 


510 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


number of evenings in succession. These formed the nucleus of the 
great Mahgala poems on the above stories which became established 
in Bengal by 1600. 

The first century and a half, after the advent of the Turks as 
a conquering people in Bengal and extension of Islamic power all 
over the province, did not allow any literature to develop. But 
after the return of peaceful conditions, when a more or less stable 
Muslim Government was established in Bengal and when the Brah¬ 
mans could pay greater attention to the old learning, a sort of early 
renaissance of Sanskrit studies and Brahmanical lore appears to 
have started in Bengal in the 14th-15th centuries. Probably the 
first great poet of Middle Bengali of whom we have some record and 
whose name and work are still well known among the people, was 
Krittivasa Ojha Mukhatl (born about 1399). He was probably the 
first and certainly the most popular poet to adapt the Sanskrit Rdmd- 
yana into Bengali (c. 1418). In place of the human and heroic Rama 
of Valmlki’s original Sanskrit epic, we have in Krittivasa’s work a 
gentle and compassionate incarnation of a living Deity to whom the 
loving faith of a simple people could easily reach. The poem of Krit¬ 
tivasa is mainly- narrative—it is not entirely saturated with the spirit 
of Bhakti such as we have in the next century after the advent of the 
great saint Chaitanya. The Krishna-legend was similarly taken up 
by Maladhara Basu, Gunaraja Khan, about 1473, in his Sri-Krishna- 
vijaya, which is based on the Sanskrit Bhagavata Parana. Here too, 
we do not as yet have the spirit of post-Chaitanya Bhakti, an abandon 
of faith in Krishna as incarnate God. The story of Bihula, who was 
widowed on the night of her wedding by snake-bite through the 
machinations of Manasa, the Snake-Goddess (who was inimical to 
Bihula’s father-in-law, the merchant Chandradhara),—how she flowed 
down the river in a raft with her husband Lakshmindhara’s body; 
how, after a series of adventures, she finally managed to propitiate 
the Gods including Manasa herself, and brought back her husband 
to life; and effected a reconciliation between Manasa and her father- 
in-law Chandradhara,-—is one of the greatest tales of wifely devo¬ 
tion and womanly courage through love, which the Indian imagination 
has produced. This story probably goes back to pre-Muslim times, 
and there is a tradition that the first poet to write on this theme was 
Kana-Haridatta, whose date is not known, but may be about A.D. 
1300. To the fifteenth century are attributed two poems on this 
theme by two different persons, Vijaya Gupta from the district of 
Barisal and Bipradasa Piplai of Baduriya Batagrama near Calcutta, 
The poem by Vijaya Gupta is perhaps not authentic, and cannot go 
back to the fifteenth century, in spite of the tradition. But Bipra- 
dasa’s work appears to have been composed about A.D. 1482. 


511 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


A great name in early medieval Bengali literature is that of 

Chandldasa, who is considered by many to be the greatest lyric poet 

of Bengal prior to Rabindranath Tagore. Over 1250 poems relating 

to the love of Radha and Krishna are current in the name of Chan- 

• • • 

dldasa. These are of diverse quality, and from both language and 
style as well as subject-matter, these cannot, all of them, be by one 
and the same person. As a matter of fact, the exact time when 
Chandldasa flourished is not known either. All that we know is 
that Chaitanya (1486-1533) used to find pleasure in singing or read¬ 
ing poems by Chandldasa, that they were sung to him as a sort of 
devotional exercise. Chandldasa was thus a predecessor (or may 
be an elder contemporary) of Chaitanya; in that case his date may 
be about A.D. 1450. Some would place him half a century earlier. 
The manuscript tradition of the poems of Chandldasa is faulty and 
not at all old. In 1916 was discovered a remarkable book which 
has been edited under the auspices of the Vanglya Sahitya Parishad 
(Calcutta) by the late Basanta Ranjan Roy, and has been carefully 
studied by a number of scholars. It is the Srl-Krishna-kirttana 
written by a poet who names himself at the end of each section as 
“Badu Chandldasa” or “Ananta Badu Chandldasa”. The script is old 
(although its antiquity has been disputed) and the language is cer¬ 
tainly older than anything discovered in Bengali, barring the Charya - 
padas. It was believed at first that the unique manuscript of the 
work belonged to the last quarter of the 14th century: now it is be¬ 
lieved that it may well be of the early sixteenth century. The story 
of Radha and Krishna’s love narrated here is certainly pre-Chaitanya 
in spirit and sentiments. There are in it translations of two songs 
from Jayadeva’s Gita-Govinda (end of the 12th century) and also 
passages which show imitations of that work. 

The Chandldasa question is a difficult problem, and this can be 
best solved by assuming that there were more poets than one named 
Chandldasa. Very probably there were three. These three Chandi- 
dasa’s appear to have been originally distinguished from each other 
by the sobriquets “Badu”, “Dvija”, and “Dina”. There was Chandl¬ 
dasa No. 1 known as Ananta Badu Chandldasa, the author of Sri 
Krishna-kirttana, who flourished before Chaitanya, may be about 
A.D. 1450, or even, possibly, 1400. He was responsible for a bare two 
dozen only 11 of the current 1200 and odd poems ascribed to Chandl¬ 
dasa, in addition to the Sri-Krishna-klrttana itself. He was a rather 
primitive and a pr e-Bhakti poet in his treatment of the theme. 
But there is genuine poetry and lyrical quality in many of the pass¬ 
ages in this work, which are worthy of a great poet. 


512 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


Chandidasa No. 2 probably had the sobriquet “Dvija” Chandi¬ 
dasa, and he may have lived shortly after Chaitanya. It was he 
who had composed those few poems on which a good deal of Chandl- 
dasa’s popularity as a poet now rests. In these poems Chaitanya’s 
longing for his God (which the poet possibly witnessed) appears to 
have coloured deeply his portrayal of Radha’s all-absorbing love for 
Krishna. Chandidasa No. 3 was probably the poet who called him¬ 
self “Dina Chandidasa”. He was rather a pedestrian poet, and was 
the author of more than eight hundred of the current Chandidasa 
poems. This “Dina Chandidasa” lived after A.D. 1600. There were 
also compositions by other unknown writers which have got into 
the Chandidasa corpus . The credulous public in Bengal has taken 
all these 1200 and odd poems in a lump as being by one Chandidasa 
and sentimentalizes over them. But “Badu Chandidasa” (No. 1) is 
certainly a great poet, and “Dvija Chandidasa” (No. 2) is perhaps 
equally great. It is these two poets, whose personalities were merged 
into one, and a third personality was also added later on, in an un¬ 
critical age of faith, leading to the creation of a single composite 
Chandidasa on whom the homage of Bengal as the greatest lyric poet 
of Early Bengali has been concentrated during the last 80 years. 

The fifteenth century was a great century in Bengal in its reli¬ 
gion and general culture and literature. The country was ruled by 
the Sultans of Turkish and Afghan origin, but they had become suffi¬ 
ciently Bengalized to support Hindu Bengali literature and to em¬ 
ploy the Hindus in responsible positions. One of the greatest Sultans 
of Bengal was Sultan Husain Shah (1493-1519), whose capital city 
was Gaud in Maldah District. The story of Raja Ganesa 12 shows 
how the nobility of Bengal had strengthened the Muslim aristocracy. 
Sultan Husain Shah had as his Private Secretary ( Dabir-Kkas ) and 
as his intimate minister ( Sdghir Malik) two Bengali Brahmans,; the 
brothers Rupa and Sanatana, who were well versed in Persian; 
and in Sanskrit. Later on thev became devoted followers of Chai- 
tanya and finally settled in Vrindavana to organize from there the 
Vaishnava Church of Bengal. Husain Shah was also an active patron 
of Bengali literature, and Paragal Khan and Chuti Khan, governors 
of Chittagong under Sultan Husain Shah and his son Sultan Naslr- 
ud-dln Nasrat Shah, had the Mahabhdrata rendered into Bengali 
verse, first by a poet called Kavlndra, whose very brief version of 
the Mahabhdrata was known as the Pdndava-Vijaya (or Vi jay a - 
Pdiidava) -kaiha, and secondly by Srikara Nandi. From the early 
fifteenth century, the tradition of telling in Bengali the Rdmdyana 
and the Mahabhdrata stories and the stories relating to Krishna 
continued down to the nineteenth century. 

513 


D.S.—33 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The Sanskrit scholars in Bengal were active during the fifteenth 
century, and an all-round cultural renaissance started from the end 
of the century. When Chaitanya came to preach the Bhakti cult 
through the figure of Krishna, the Puranas, the Mahtibharata and 
the Rdmayana were eagerly studied; renowned jurists like Smarta 
Raghunandana Bhattacharya, logicians like Raghunatha Sir omani, 
and poets like Chaturbhuja Misra (the author of the Haricharita , a 
kavya in Sanskrit on the story of Krishna) came to the field to 
strengthen the tradition of Sanskrit scholarship in Bengal. Social 
organizers like Devivara Ghataka established a set of social usages 
in matters of marriage among the Brahmans wTiich for the time 
being helped to keep the society intact against the onslaught of 
Islam. Colleges of Sanskrit learning sprang up everywhere, parti¬ 
cularly at Navadvipa, in Nadia district, in Vishnupur in Bankura 
district (even in Muslim times the centre of a strong Hindu princi¬ 
pality), in many a Brahman village along the Bhaglrathl or Hooghly 
river, in Vikrampur in Dacca district, in Rajshahi and Maldah 
in North Bengal, in Mymensingh, in Chittagong, and at places 
in Faridpur (like Kotalipara); in fact, almost wherever there were 
Brahmans and Hindus. Contacts wdth centres of Sanskrit learning 
and Hindu culture like Mithila, Orissa, Gaya, Banaras and Vrinda- 
vana were also established. 

Chaitanya, who flourished from 1486 to 1533, rode at the crest 
of the wave of the fifteenth century Brahmanical renaissance, and 
gave a new turn to Hinduism in Bengal through a reviving 
Vaishnavism with Krishna and Radha as symbols for the Divinity 
and its innate power of Bliss (Hladirii Sakti). The personality of 
Chaitanya is looked upon by many Bengalis as the greatest fact of 
Bengal’s cultural and spiritual life in late medieval times. Cer¬ 
tainly, through his advent there came an unprecedented impetus to 
the intellect and spirit of Bengal. His influence on his followers and 
devotees, from king to beggar, from Brahman to outcast and to 
Muslim, was something unsurpassed. During his lifetime, his fol¬ 
lowers took him as a perfect incarnation of the Deity, particularly 
in its aspect of Radha as its power of Bliss. Chaitanya was a great 
scholar, but he was also God-intoxicated. He left only eight Sanskrit 
verses and an eight-stanza hymn to Jagannatha or Vishnu. But what 
he is supposed to have taught is elaborated by the later Gaudlya 
or Bengali Vaishnava philosophy in the sixteenth and the two 
following centuries. Chaitanya lived his early life in Bengal, went 
on pilgrimage to the extreme South of India from where he brought 
some Sanskrit works, returned to North India by way of Western 
India (Maratha country), spent some time in Vrindavana and Bana- 


514 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


ras, and passed his last years at Puri in Orissa. He was thus an 
all-India figure, and he had the King of Orissa, Prataparudra-deva, 
as one of his devoted disciples. 

With Chaitanya’s advent and after his death, a number of bio¬ 
graphies, introducing a new genre in Bengali literature, were written 
in Bengal, relating both to Chaitanya and his followers. But these 
belong to the next period of the history of India. 

9. Brajabull 

During the sixteenth century, a form of an artificial literary 
language became established in Bengal as well as in Assam and, to 
some extent, in Orissa. It was the Brajabull dialect and we may 
consider it to be the result of a direct influence of Maithili lyric 
poetry on the literature of Bengal. Brajabull is practically the Mai¬ 
thili speech as current in Mithila, modified in its forms to look like 
Bengali, and at the same time influenced by reminiscences of the 
old Apabhraihsa and Avahattha traditions in Indian literature. The 
earliest Brajabull poem that we know of in Bengali literature is 
ascribed to Ramananda Raya, a disciple of Chaitanya in Orissa, and 
it goes back to the beginning of the sixteenth century. The story of 
Brajabull in Assam is given later. 

10. Maithili 

The literary use of Maithili would appear to have started in 
the same period as Bengali. According to tradition, Umapatidhara, 
a poet of the 12th-13th centuries, composed the Pdrijata-harana, a 
small drama in Sanskrit, in which the songs are in Maithili; but the 
authenticity and authorship of this work have been called into ques¬ 
tion. The earliest Maithili work that we have is the Varna-ratnd- 
kara n of Jyotirisvara Thakura, which was written about 1325. This 
is a work of set descriptions of various subjects and situations, to 
supply ready-made cliche passages to story-tellers and Purana- 
reciters in the vernacular. The Maithili Brahmans were great 
Sanskrit scholars, and at the same time they did not neglect their 
mother-tongue. The Varna-ratndkara is important, not only because 
it gives us specimens of pure Maithili prose of the early fourteenth 
century, but also because it is a store-house of information, conveyed 
through words, about the life and culture of early Medieval India in 
all their aspects. Jyotirisvara Thakura was also a great Sanskrit 
writer, and a Sanskrit farce and a treatise on erotics by him are 
well known. After Jyotirisvara, Maithili has for some decades no 
other specimen of literature worth mentioning. But a great poet, 
one of the greatest lyric poets of North India, came into being in 


515 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Mithila in the fifteenth century. He was Vidyapati Thakura, and 
although his floruit is not certain, he is believed to have lived bet¬ 
ween 1350 and 1450. He was an educated Brahman who composed 
several works in Sanskrit also, and some of these Sanskrit works 
like the Purusha-parikshd was very popular in North India. He 
wrote a historical poem, the Kirttilatd, in a dialect which he calls 
Avahattha, describing an episode in the life of one of the Hindu kings 
of Mithila, who was one of his patrons. The Kirttilatd , 14 which is 
a narrative poem with vivid descriptions of a town like Jaunpur, 
is composed mainly in a late form of Western Apabhramsa with 
vernacular influences, and this is known as the Avahattha speech. 
In some cases the Avahattha is mixed with pure Maithili. 

The lyrics of Vidyapati, treating the great theme of the love 
of Radha and Krishna, constitute an important landmark in the 
literature of Maithili, and are the glory of Early Maithili litera¬ 
ture composed largely within the period before 1526. These Radha- 
Krishna poems of Vidyapati took by storm the heart of Bengal also, 
and they were largely imitated by Bengali poets; and in their hands, 
as said before, the Brajabuli language developed as a half-way house 
between Bengali and Maithili. Vidyapati’s poems are not generally 
mystic or spiritual, but they give a very charming account of love, 
in the ordinary sense of the term. He has also to his credit a number 
of poems relating to Siva and Devi which are still sung in Mithila. 
The popularity of his love poems which were connected with Radha 
and Krishna has gradually established him in the imagination of the 
Bengal Vaishnavas as a great Vaishnava devotee and saint—a Maha » 
jana; but for this there is no evidence. 

11. Assamese 

Assamese is spoken along the valley of the Brahmaputra river. 
Numerically, Assamese is not important, but its literary output is 
quite respectable, showing the high culture of its speakers. 
Assamese is very like Bengali, and Early Assamese and Early Bengali 
at one time converged into one speech. The Charydpadas of Old 
Bengali have also been claimed for Old Assamese. 

The oldest Assamese writer seems to have been Herna Sarasvatl 
of late thirteenth century. He lived in the court of the king of 
Kama t a to the west of Assam State. 14a His Prahldda-charita, based 
on the Sanskrit Vishnu Pur ana, shows a finished Sanskritized style 
for Assamese. Hema Sarasvatl was followed in the court of the 
king of Kamatapur by two poets, Harihara Vipra and Kaviratna 
Sarasvatl, who rendered into Assamese verse episodes from the 
Mahdhhdrata (early fourteenth century). 


516 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


Kaviraja Madhava Kandali (fourteenth century) is the first 
great poet of Assamese. He flourished at the court of the king of 
Cachar in Eastern Assam. His work consists of a version of the 
Rdmdyana , and a narrative poem, Devajit, on Krishna as the Supreme 
Divinity. Madhava wrote in a very simple form of Assamese, not 
too Sanskritized, and quite racy of the soil. He anticipated the later 
Vaishnava renaissance in Assam in the fifteenth and the sixteenth 
centuries. 

Among the poets of the fifteenth century were Durgavara, who 
re-told the story of the Rdmdyana in songs (the Gzta-Rdmdyana ), 
and the poets Pltambara and Manakara, who composed a large num¬ 
ber of love songs centring respectively round the stories of Usha 
and Aniruddha of the Purana (the Usha-Parinaya by Pltambara) and 
of Bihula and Lakshmmdhara ( Bihuld-Lakhindhara ) of Manakara. 
Quite a mass of literature known as the Mantras or Magical Charms, 
of unknown authorship, is found in Assamese, and all these may go 
back to the period before 1500. These Mantras contained magical 
formulae against snake-bite, against ghosts and demons, against 
various kinds of diseases, and against thieves and evil-doers. 

The greatest period of Assamese literature was ushered in with 
the Bhakti movement inaugurated by the great Sahkaradeva, the 
Vaishnava religious reformer, saint and poet, who is said to have 
lived, like Kablr, for 119 years (from 1449 to 1568). The move¬ 
ment he started was of course the provincial Assamese form of a 
pan-Indian Bhakti movement, which thoroughly changed the face of 
Hindu society in Assam. In that province, Saktism or worship of 
the Mother Goddess, which might have been largely derived from 
the pre-Aryan Mongoloid peoples of Assam, appears to have been 
the dominant religion before the advent of Sahkaradeva. It had 
bloody sacrifices as an essential part of its ritual, hecatombs of goats, 
sheep, buffaloes, pigeons, and occasionally of human beings being 
the rule. The Great Mother was more dreaded than loved, and 
priest-craft, magic and Tantric practices distracted the people’s faith. 
Sahkaradeva, who belonged to the Kalita or a high non-Brahman 
caste, virtually changed the religious outlook of the Assamese peo¬ 
ple. He preached absolute faith in a God of Love, Vishnu or his 
incarnation Krishna, and his doctrine was known as the Eka-sarana - 
dharma, or the “Religion of seeking refuge in One”. Prayer and 
praise, apart from simple Bahmanical worship with flowmrs and 
harmless offerings, were taught by him as the best form of devo¬ 
tional exercise. Sahkaradeva’s ideas spread over the whole of Assam, 
and for this new faith he and his followers started to create the 
necessary literature in the language of the people. Late in life 


517 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


he received a great deal of support from the powerful Koch king 
of Western Assam and Northern Bengal, a prince of whose family 
took a daughter of Sankaradeva’s house to wife. Sahkaradeva’s 
hymns and other works formed the basis of evening prayers and 
evening service in all the villages of Assam, where the people gather¬ 
ed in the communal Nam-ghar or “The House of Praise” for com¬ 
munal worship through song and chant and reading. Among the 
more important works which Sankaradeva composed were the fol¬ 
lowing (he composed some 27 works in all): (1) the last canto of the 
Ramayana ;(2) some portions of the Bhagavata Purdna ; (3) Kirttana - 
ghoshci —probably his greatest work (this book gives in 30 poems, 
comprising about 2398 verses, some episodes from the story of 
Vishnu or Krishna and of their devotees; the poems are romance, 
parables and didactic literature, as well as song, all in one, and are 
greatly popular with the Assamese people); (4) Rukmmi-harana, a 
narrative poem depicting an episode of the life of Krishna in a 
charming style (this poem is also popular, quotations from it being 
current in the language like proverbs); (5) The Bhakti-pradipa, a 
devotional work; and (6) the Nimi-nava-siddha-samvdda. 

Sankaradeva also wrote a number of dramas, based on stories 
from the Puranas, known as Ankiyd Nat (One-act Plays). These 
dramas show Maithili influence; the prose and verse portions are 
not in pure Assamese, but in a mixture of Maithili and Assamese, 
or are in an artificial or composite Assamese-Maithill literary dia¬ 
lect, like the Brajabull of Bengal; and in Assam this speech is known 
as Brajavali. Like the miracle-plays of medieval Christendom, these 
plays helped to popularize the stories of the Puranas, and they are 
performed even now in the villages. The best known of these are 
the Rdma-vijaya , the Rdliya-damanci, the Pdrijdta-harana , the Ruk- 
mini-h.arana and the Patrii-pra&ada. Another new kind of poetry 
which Sankaradeva introduced into Assamese was the Bar-git ( Vara - 
gdta), devotional poems, sometimes ecstatic in an abandon of faith, 
sometimes contemplative and reflective, at times exhortatory and 
seeking to create a distaste for the world and the flesh by incul¬ 
cating love for God. These poems are immensely nopular, being 
frequently sung at the present day. There are other works by 
Sankaradeva which are very popular, but it is not necessary to 
describe them all in detail. 

The next great poet of Early Assamese was Madhavadasa (1489- 
1596), a disciple of Sankaradeva. His literary output was more or 
less on the lines of that of his master. But we need not discuss his 
works as mostly they fall within the period after 1526. Following 
Madhavadasa was Rama Sarasvati, another poet in the same line. 


518 


SANSKRITIC LITERATURE 


A word may be said about Assamese historical literature,—the 
Buranjis. This the Assamese language took over from the Sino- 
Tibetan Ahom speech, and the Ahom conquerors of Assam, who 
established their rule in Eastern Assam in the thirteenth century, 15 
appear to have had a good sense of history, and encouraged the 
writing of histories in their own language. The word Buranji is 
Ahom (Thai) in origin. But we cannot take up the study of this 
question as well as of Assamese prose, because these Buranjis came 
to be written in Assamese only from the seventeenth century 
onwards. 


12. Oriyd 

Bengali, Oriya and Assamese are sister-languages, and they have 
a very great resemblance with each other. Only during the six¬ 
teenth and seventeenth centuries Oriya fell tremendously under the 
spell of Sanskrit, and followed its own peculiar line of develop¬ 
ment, with greater and greater Sanskritization in the subsequent 
centuries. The oldest specimens of Oriya are found in some inscrip¬ 
tions, three of these being dated A.D. 990, 1036 and 1249. The last 
is very important, as we have in it a number of connected lines in 
Old Oriya. Some Oriya scholars, like those of Assam, regard the 
speech of the Charydpadas to be the oldest form of their language. 
The Maithils have also made the same claim. 

Orissa had virtually the same script as Bengal, Assam and Bihar, 
to start with, but in recent centuries this script has changed consi¬ 
derably, and acquired a different and characteristic form of its own. 

The history of Oriya literatue may be divided into the follow¬ 
ing periods: 

(1) Old Oriya, to A.D. 1300. 

(2) Early Middle-Oriya, from A.D. 1300 to 1500. 

Then we have Middle Middle-Oriya, and Late Middle-Oriya, 
bringing the history of the literature to 1850, and finally we have 
the Modern Oriya, after 1850. 

During the Old Oriya period, apart from the inscriptions men¬ 
tioned above we have the following works, and writings: 

The beginnings of the Mddala-Pdnji, or the palm-leaf chronicles 
of the temple of Jagannatha at Puri, go back to the 12th century, 16 
showing the very early use of prose in literary compositions. The 
authenticity of the oldest fragments so far available, however, has 
to be established. In the fourteenth century we have a poem, by 
Vatsadasa (Bachhadasa), the Kalasa-chautisd in 34 verses, the words 
in each verse beginning with a consonant letter as in the arrange- 


519 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ment of the Oriya alphabet. This deals with the marriage of Siva 
and Parvati—a work in poetic prose. Rudra-sudhd-nidhi, a romance 
with a religious (Yoga-Vedanta-Tantra) purpose, was composed in 
the fourteenth century by Narayanananda Avadhuta Svaml. Another 
important poet of the fourteenth century is Saraladasa, who may be 
described as the first great poet of Orissa. He wrote the Chandl 
Piirchia and the VUankd Rdmdyana, both extolling the Goddess 
Durga, and gave a brief version of the Mahdbhdrata in 700 verses, 
in which he omitted certain portions of the story and brought in a 
number of new stories and modifications. The language appears 
modern—but Oriya has not changed much in the course of the last- 
seven or eight centuries. In the fourteenth century, we find also 
evidence of a sort of early renaissance of Vaishnava Blnakti in Oriya 
literature. Markandadasa composed his Mahdbhdshya dealing with 
the Rama story, and the Kesava-koUi, a poem of 34 verses describing 
the grief of Yasoda, foster-mother of Krishna, at the latter’s depar¬ 
ture from Vrindavana to Mathura. This poem is got by heart by 
most Oriya people at the present day. 

Arjunadasa (early fifteenth century) wrote the Rdma-bibhd or 
“the Marriage of Rama”, the first long poem in Oriya. It is really 
a collection of lyrics on the sentiments of love, with some comic 
interludes. Other poets of the fifteenth century were Nilambara- 
dasa (he translated the Jaimini Mahdbhdrata and the PoAma Pur ana ), 
Mahadevadasa, Govindabhanja and Damodaradasa. 

Next we have the period of Jagannathadasa (sixteenth to seven¬ 
teenth centuries). It begins with the advent of Chaitanya from 
Bengal into Orissa for the first time in 1510. The king of Orissa 
(Orissa was at that time a great empire, extending from the frontiers 
of Bengal in the north to the Tamil country in the south and the 
Vijayanagara and Bahmani kingdoms on the west), Prataparudra- 
deva, accepted Chaitanya as his spiritual teacher, and a new period 
of Vaishnava revival brought in a new development of Oriya lite¬ 
rature. In Orissa, Chaitanya came to have a number of intimate 
disciples and friends—e.g. Raya Ramananda Dasa who followed 
pure Bhakti, and also the five religious teachers and poets who 
followed Bhakti with Jndna, namely Balaramadasa, Jagannatha¬ 
dasa, Yasovanta, Ananta and Achyutananda. Most of these writers 
had already been engaged in their literary labours before they met 
Chaitanya. Balaramadasa made a rendering in Oriya verse of the 
Rdmdyana (c. A.D. 1500), with matter incorporated from the various 
Purana sources, which is universally popular. He wrote other books 
likb a rendering of the Bhagavad-gita, and the Veddnta-sdra, and books 
like the Gupta-vdrtd, Bhdva-samudra or “the Ocean of Emotion”, 


520 



DRAVIDIAN LITERATURE 


and the Brahrrvdnda-bhiigola. Jagannathadasa was a close friend of 
Chaitanya, who gave him the sobriquet of Ati-bada or “Supremely 
Great”, because of his saintly character. He translated the Bhaga- 
vata Parana , which is perhaps the most popular book in the Oriya 
language. It is read every day in all Oriya villages in the Bhdgavata- 
ghara or Public Prayer House for reading the Bhdgavata and sing¬ 
ing or chanting prayers. Jagannathadasa introduced edifying 
stories from other sources into his Bhdgavata, and used a simple 
and easily read metre of nine syllables for his great work. He has 
largely been responsible for elevating the moral qualities of the 
Oriya people through this work, and a general eagerness to be able 
to read it has helped the cause of literacy in many parts of Orissa. 
Jagannathadasa composed a large number of other works in both 
Oriya and Sanskrit. The other four associates of Jagannathadasa 
were similarly responsible for a large number of religious works 
in Oriya, and it is not necessary to enumerate them. Achyutananda- 
dasa is credited with the composition of one thousand works. 17 

C. DRAVIDIAN 
I. TAMIL 

As the condition of South India was a good deal unsettled during 
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, literature in the Tamil country 
was rather In a bad way and the spurts of literary activity were 
spasmodic, uncertain and unequal. No single dominating figure like 
Karnhan adorns this epoch. None the less, this epoch has made its 
own characteristic contribution to Tamil literature and it has given 
us a few literary masterpieces, a good number of impromptu verses, 
and the echo of many faded old controversies. 

Villiputturar: What Kamban did to the Rdmdyana of Valmiki, 
Villiputturar sought to do in respect of the Mahdbhdrata —to bring it 
within the reach of the Tamil people. Diwan Bahadur V. Krishna- 
machariar thinks that Villiputturar must have flourished in the 
thirteenth century. 1 But a somewhat later date is more probable. 
Villiputturar, being a Vaishnava, was fascinated by the personality 
of the divine-human Krishna. He seems to have composed the Tamil 
Bharaiam on the suggestion of his royal patron, Alkondan, the Chera 
king. Although according to tradition, there were 6,000 verses in 
Villiputturar’s version, the poem, as it has come down to us, is in¬ 
complete and consists of only 4,351 verses. The latter portion has 
been done into Tamil by Ranganatha Kavirayar, and we have thus 
the whole of the Bharaiam in Tamil verse. 


521 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Villiputturar was well versed in Sanskrit, and used Sanskrit 
expressions freely in his version. He had before him, not only the 
Mahabharatci of Vyasa, but also the shorter Balabhdrata of Agastya 
Pandita and other versions of the great epic in the various Puranas. 
But it seems to be clear nevertheless that, “he had mainly in view 
the original Mahabharatci, obviously through the southern recension 
of the epic.” 2 

Villiputturar’s Bharatam is among the most popular poems in 
Tamil. The section devoted to Krishna’s embassy to the Kuru chief 
is justly famous and is even today repeated with fervour in the 
nooks and corners of the Tamil country. In description, charac¬ 
terization, dramatic vividness and verbal suppleness, the Tamil 
Bharatam is quite the equal of the Telugu version of Nanniah and 
Tikkanna and the Kannada version of Kumara Vyasa. It is not 
surprising, therefore, that Villiputturar is reckoned as one of the 
latter-day “Alvars” and venerated as such by the South Indian 
Vaishnavas. 

Arunagiri was in all likelihood Villiputturar’s contemporary. 
Tradition makes Arunagiri and Villiputturar the protagonists of a 
thrilling religious controversy. Be that us it may, Arunagiri was a 
god-intoxicated singer, whose Tiruppugazh is one of the perennially 
fascinating items in the repertory of Tamil devotional music. 
Arunagiri lived and laved in the glory of Muruga or God Subra- 
manya, who is his one inexhaustible theme in poetry and song. One 
verse from Arunagiri is here given for a sample, in Mr. J. M. Nalla- 
swami Pillai’s rendering: 

“O! Thou lover of the well adorned Devasena, 

O Muruga! With Thy kindly grace. 

The claims of desire are sundered in twain, 

And lo! that unspeakable joy was born”. 3 
Shorn of the music, however, and especially in the alien English 
garb, Tiruppugazh inevitably loses much of its magic and spiritual 
potency. 

Sivachariar: One writer, who stands rather apart, is Kachiappa 
Sivachariar, a Brahman of Conjeevararn. He was extraordinarily 
proficient in Tamil, no less than in Sanskrit, and his versatility was 
amazing. He composed the Kanda-purdnam , an elaborate work on 
the feats of God Subramanya. The work has maintained its place 
in the affections of Tamil ;§aivites, and is held in special veneration 
by the Tamil people of North Ceylon (Jaffna). It is a people’s hand¬ 
book of the philosophy of religion, although it is quite easy to look 
upon it primarily as a supernatural romantic epic with Subramanya 
and Valli for hero and heroine, and Sura for the villain who ulti- 


522 


DRAVIDIAN LITERATURE 


mately transcends his villainy and attains mukti. Sura-sambara or 
the destruction of Sura at the hands of Subramanya is one of the 
festivals in South India, and indeed Kanda-puranam, notwithstand¬ 
ing its many incredible stories, remains an important constituent of 
the popular culture of the Tamil people. 

Kalamekam: The most entertaining figure in Tamil literature, 
Kalamekam, whose original name was Varadar, occupies a position 
in Tamil analogous to that of a Lewis Corroll or an Edward Lear in 
English. Kalamekam lived a wild, unconventional and adventurous 
life, mixing freely, it would appear, with potentates and prostitutes 
alike. His metrical facility and verbal fluency were astounding, 
while his quickness of perception and innate sense of the ludicrous 
gave his impromptu verses an irresistible flavour and piquancy. 
His encounter with Adimadurakavi, the court poet, was on all 
accounts a thrilling affair. Pride and conceit collided against 
greater pride and more justifiable conceit, and extempore verses 
rained from Kalamekam’s lips as pour torrents of rain from heavy- 
laden clouds. Uncannily quick-witted, audacious, verbally supple, 
keen-eyed to spot out the ludicrous and the droll, Kalamekam 
appealed to his audiences at once, and threw his hearers into bouts 

-v 

of laughter. Matched against him, poor Adimadurakavi was like a 
heavy club pitted against a shining blinding rapier. Kalamekam 
is reported to have made the boast that within a mere trice he could 
roll out a thousand verses, like a downpour from a heavy massive 
cloud. Making due allowance for poetic exaggeration, Kalamekam 
seems to have been nearly as goood as his word. Of god, man and 
beast, of Kamban and Timmi, the Telugu courtezan and Ramayyan’s 
horse, of impossible people and incredible similitudes,—Kalamekam 
sang of them all with equal nonchalance and always with striking 
effect. Although he wrote some serious poems also, he is re¬ 
membered mainly in the context of the many episodes which 
quickened him to bright or biting song. Two other poetic persona¬ 
lities, who were probably Kalamekam’s later contemporaries, were 
the weaver twins—the Irattavar—one of whom was blind, and the 
other lame. They lived by begging, the blind carrying the lame 
on his shoulders. Both gifted with a turn for poetry, they put it 
to good account. As one began a verse, the other completed it with 
singular aptness. Their joint sustained work is a poem by name 
Ekambarandthar UM . 

Other poets: Venkatanatha (Vedantadesika), greatest among 
Ramanuja’s successors, was a versatile scholar and writer. His 
maior contributions were to Sanskrit literature, but he wrote his 
classic treatise, the Rahasyatrayasara, in a mixture of Tamil and 


523 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 

Sanskrit known as manipravdla. Besides he composed a number 
of Tamil songs, mainly of a devotional nature, and these are collec- 
tively known as the Desika-prahandham and are held in reverence 
by the South Indian Vaishnavites. Poyyamoli Pulavar, Virakkavir- 
ayar, Nirambalakia Desikar and Tolkappia Thevar were among the 
other well-known poets or poetic persons of the time. 

II. KANNADA 

The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were essentially a period 
of transition in religion as well as literature. The Jain writers were 
losing ground, the Vlrasaiva writers maintained their position of 
vantage, and the Vaishnava writers were registering their first title- 
deeds. The Age of Basava and Prabhudeva was left behind; the Age 
of Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa was yet to begin. In the mean¬ 
time, there was much significant activity in the realm of Kannada 
letters. 

As in the previous centuries, the Jain-Puranas continued to ap¬ 
pear at odd intervals. Thus Madhura wrote a Purana on the life of 
Dharmanatha, the fifteenth Tirthahkara, while a century later 
Mahgarasa and Santikiriti wrote Puranas on the lives of Nemi-Jinesa 
and Santinatha, the twenty-second and sixteenth Tirthahkaras res¬ 
pectively. Besides, the life-story of Jivandhara, a pious Jain king, 
was made the theme of no less than three poems in shatpadi metre, 
the authors being Bhaskara, Bommarasa and Kotesvara. 

The Basava-pumna 1 now started a parallel tradition in hagio- 
logy in Vlrasaiva literature. Bhima Kavi, the author of the Basava- 
purdna y seems to have made use of a Telugu work of that name. Com¬ 
pleted in the third quarter of the fourteenth century, the Basava - 
purana was popular from the very beginning and has exerted great 
influence on subsequent Vlrasaiva writers. The Basava-pumna is true 
to type, mixing as it does an ounce of fact with a pound of fanciful 
imagination, and numerous are the miracles attributed to Basava. 
True faith can lift mountains, and the genuine Siva-bhakia has 
nothing to fear in this world. While some of the episodes may raise 
a smile, the general ethical purport of the Basava-purana is beyond 
question. On being charged with misappropriation by his king, 
Bijjala, Basava is made to answer: 

“Will Tiamsa- swan, that’s free to drink 
Of the boundless Sea of Milk, 

Seek salt-sea water for its thirst? 

O Bijjala, bethink! 

Or will the lion feed on herbs? 


521 


DRAVIDIAN LITERATURE 

Will parrot throw away 

The mango’s luscious fruit, to eat 

Insipid jungle-nut? 

When these things hap, then may’st thou think 

The Siva-bhakta too 

May cast his heaven-born treasure down 

To steal man’s petty gold.” 2 

The poem abounds in such asseverations, and also anecdotes to 
illustrate and justify them. It served as a model to Shadakshara- 
deva’s Vrishabhendra-vijaya, nearly three hundred years later. 

Another Virasaiva-Purana, the P rabhulinga-lile, centres round 
the life of Ailama Prabhu, who was Basava’s contemporary and 
president of the Anubhava Mantapa that Basava established to 
propagate the Vlrasaiva religion and philosophy. Chamarasa, the 
author of the Prabhulinga-lile, is said to have composed this poem 
of 25 chapters and 1,111 verses in the course of only eleven days. 
Chamarasa was patronized by the Vijayanagara king, (Praudha) 
Devaraya II. As Chamarasa is described as the brother-in-law of 
Naranappa (Kumara Yyasa), who was a Brahman, it is likely that 
Chamarasa wrote the Prabhulhga-liie with the enthusiasm of a new 
convert. Of this work Mr. C. P. Brown writes: “It is an allegorical 
poem of considerable beauty, and is particularly attractive from the 
pleasing manner in which it describes the female sex. It is not only 
amusing but is written with such delicacy that any Hindu female 
might read it with gratification”. The Prabhulinga-lile has been 
translated into Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit and Marathi. 

As the Virasaivas held in great veneration the sixty-three 
purdtanas— -that is, the Tamil Saivacharyas, Appar, Sambandar, 
Sundarar, Kannappar and the rest, sixty-three in all—poems about 
them also appeared in Kannada. The most famous of these is Nija- 
guna iSivayogi’s Aruvattu-Muvara-tripadi, being an account of the 
sixty-three Tamil Saiva saints. This work was composed towards 
the close of the fifteenth century. Other Pur-anas composed during 
the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries include the Padmamja- 
purana (based on the life of one of Basava’s contemporaries, Kereya 
Padmarasa), the Revana-siddhesvara-kavya of Mallanna, and the 
Arddhya-charita (on the life of Panditaradhya) by Mallikarjuna Kavi. 

The Vlrasaiva writers composed also a number of doctrinal 
works during this period, especially during the fifteenth century. 
We may here mention in particular Mahalingadeva’s Ekottarasatas - 
thala, Lakkanna Dandesa’s Swatattva-chintdmam , Jakkanarya’s 
Nurondu-sthala, Tontada Siddhalinga’s Shatsihala-jhdndmritasdra, 


525 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Nijaguna Sivayogi’s Anubhavasara and Gubbiya Malianary a’s Bhava- 
chintdratna. 

Vaishnava Literature: The Vaishnava revival in South India 
began at the time of the Alvars. The work of the Alvars was conti¬ 
nued by Acharyas like Nathamuni, Yamuna, Ramanuja, Madhva 
and Venkatanatha. As in the Telugu country, so also in Karnataka, 
one important cause of the spread of the Vaishnava movement was 
the appearance of vernacular translations of Sanskrit classics like 
the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the Bhdgavata. Naranappa 
(Kumara Vyasa), who has been referred to above, composed about 
the middle of the fifteenth century a Kannada version of the Mahd - 
bhdrata, popularly called the Gadugina-Bhdrata. Of this work, 
Mr. D. V. Gundappa writes: 

“This is perhaps the grandest poem in the language.For 

vastness of conception, for vividness of portraiture, for the variegat¬ 
ed splendours of a colossal and complex drama, for the sweep of 
imagination that can reproduce for us the varying notes mixed in 
a mighty clash of human forces—avarice, indignation, pity, melan¬ 
choly, love, hate, scorn, irony, desperation, terror, heroism, nobility, 
envy, meanness, magnanimity, faith, hope—, for a sustained spiritual 
idealism and a kindly and manful attitude towards life, as well as 
for naturalness and freedom and vigour of style, this work stands 
supreme.” 

Kumara Vyasa completed only the first ten parvas of the Mahd- 
bhdrata, and the remaining ones were done into Kannada in the 
opening years of Krishnadeva Raya’s reign by Timmanna. Transla¬ 
tions of the Rdmayayia and the Bhdgavata , too, appeared in due 
course. Narahari (Kumara Valmiki) completed his Torave Rama - 
yana about the end of the fifteenth century, and Chattu Vithala- 
natha completed his Kannada Bhdgavata-purdna not long afterwards; 
but neither reaches the level of inspired excellence that is so natural 
to Kumara Vyasa. 3 

III. TELUGU 

The fourteenth century of the Christian era saw the downfall 
of the Kakatlya empire and the rise of a number of small principali¬ 
ties like that of the Reddis of Kondavidu. Errapragada, one of the 
trio of the Mahabharata poets, mentioned above 1 , was the court poet 
of Prolaya Verna, the earliest of the Reddi kings, who ruled over 
Kondavidu in the first half of the fourteenth century A.D. Erra- 
pragada’s first work was Ramayana in Champu form dedicated 
to Malla Reddi, the brother of Prolaya Verna. But it is now lost. 
After translating the portion of Aranyakaparva of the Mahabharata, 


526 





DRAVIDIAN LITERATURE 


left over by Nanniah, 2 he translated the Harivayhsa into Telugu, as 
it formed a sequel to the Mahabharata, and dedicated it to Prolaya 
Vema Redqli. He had a very great respect for the two early 
Mahabharata poets and tried to imitate them in every respect. He 
earned the title of Prabandhaparamesvara because of the Prabandha 
characteristics and the descriptive element which he has displayed 
in his last work, the Nrisimhapurdna. Nachana Somanadha was a 
junior contemporary of Errapragada, and happens to be his great 
rival. He was a great scholar and called himself “Sahiiya-rasa- 
poshana” in his translation of Uttara-Harivarhsa, which he took up 
again to show by contrast that his method of dealing with it would be 
more artistic and attractive than that of Errapragada. He took only 
some select portions of Uttara-Harivamsa in his work, and by his 
artistic descriptions, lively conversations, and beautiful imagery, 
converted the Puranic story into a work of art, leading the way for 
the Prabandha of a later age. He was a close follower of Tikkana 
and like him he dedicated his work to the God Hariharanadha, and 
contributed his mite to establish the Brahmanic faith and Dharma- 
dvaita in his country. 

The next 150 years (A.D. 1350-1500) may be said to be the age 

of Srinatha, since he happened to be the dominating personality in 

the literary field during that time. He belonged to the latter half 

of the fourteenth and the earlier half of the fifteenth century and 

had connections with various chiefs and ruling kings of his age. He 

was originally connected with the Reddi kings of Kondavidu, acting 

as an educational minister of Peda Komati Vema Reddi. After the 

• • • 

fall of the kingdom of Kondavidu he went round the country, visited 
various darbars of kings, took part in literary and poetic contests, 
and had the unique honour of Kanakabhisheka at the hands of Deva- 
raya II of Vijayanagara in his court. He began writing poetry in his 
early age and was already a master of his art in his early youth. His 
first work, and the first work of its kind in Telugu, was the translation 
of Salivahana Saptasati from Prakrit to Telugu; it is considered Gy 
many as a significant service to Telugu, though it is unfortunately not 
available now. He also translated the Naishadha-charita of Srlharsha 
into Telugu, which was generally considered a hard nut to crack. He 
had greater leanings towards Saivism, and translated Bhimesvara - 
purdnam and Rasikhandam, dealing with the kshetras or holy places 
connected with Saiva worship. His Haravilasa deals with the 
various stories connected with Siva. In his Palnati-Vlracharitra, 
Srinatha has stepped out of the field of classical poetry, and has trod¬ 
den into the field of historical romance. The story deals with the 
quarrels leading to a war among the local chiefs of Palnadu, and it 


527 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


was told in the appropriate desl metre of racy dvipada. Srinatha 
was a poet of unrivalled scholarship and had a great love for 
his country. He has not only described the various kshetras of the 
Telugu country with great devotion and enthusiasm, but also depict¬ 
ed the life and manners of the various parts of the country with a 
humorous touch all his own, in his Vidhinataka. Though he was 
greatly honoured by kings and dined with them in plates of gold, he 
had to lead a life of penury in the latter part of his life, as his 
fortunes also changed with the fortunes of the kings whom he 
served. Srinatha is considered as an epoch-maker in the history of 
Telugu literature, who led the way for the period of classical Pra- 
bandha in Telugu. 

Potana, another outstanding poet, was a great contrast to Sri¬ 
natha, both in the way of his life, as well as in his treatment of poetry. 
He was a self-made man and had a natural instinct for poetry. He 
was content to lead a simple life of a cultivator away from the bustle 
of kings and courts. He translated the Bhdgavata into Telugu and 
chose to dedicate if to Sri Rama, the human incarnation of God, 
whom he worshipped w T ith unfailing devotion. This Bhdgavata is 
one of the most popular works in Telugu literature, both on account 
of the liveliness of his narration and poetic diction, and of its power¬ 
ful appeal in rousing the sentiment of Bhakti or devotion. 

Another great poet, almost as great as Potana in the opinion of 
some, was his contemporary Pinavirabhadra, author of the Sringdra- 
Sakuntald, and the Jaimini-Bhdrata. 

A number of works, dealing with the stories connected with the 
exploits or deeds of great personages of old, were produced during 
this period. Jakkana’s Vikramdrkacharita deals with the stories 
connected with the King Vikrama. Bhojardjlya of Anantamatya 
deals with the stories of the King Bhoja. Navanddhacharitra of 
Gaurana describes the exploits of the Nine Nadhas or Saiva saints, 
and SivaliWvildsa of Nissanka Kommana deals with the various IIIas 
or sportive stories connected with Siva. Gaurana has adopted 
dvipada metre in his Navanddhacharitra, and the Harischandro- 
pdkhydna, which is his other work, was also written in dvipada 
metre. During the latter half of the fifteenth century, stories 
dealing with Kshetramdhdtmya seem to have attracted the attention 
of a good number of poets in Telugu. The Rukmdngadacharitra of 
Mallana, the Srlrangamdhdtmya of Bhirava Kavi and the Kdhchi - 
puramdhdtmya of Daggupalli Duggana may be cited as examples. 
Vennelakanti Suranna translated the Vishnu Purdna and the Vardha 
Purdna was translated by the two poets, Nandi Mallaya and Ghanta 
Singaya, who are also responsible for the rendering of the Sanskrit 


528 


DRAVIDIAN LITERATURE 


drama Prabodhachandrodaya, into Telugu in the form of a Pra- 
bandha. The Upanishadic story of Nachiketas was developed in 
Telugu by Daggupalli Duggana in a work called the Ndsiketup- 
dkhydna . The Vaishnavite influence in Telugu literature began to 
be felt during this period in the works of Tallapaka Annamacharyulu 
and his family, who composed thousands of songs or Sahklrtanas on 
the Lord Venkatesvara. Various other works in dvipada and other 
desl metres, were also written by them. 

Thus though the translation of the Puranas and the Purana- 
Khandas was going on as before, Kdvyas, short stories, mdhdtmyas 
and scientific works also supplied the topics for the poets during this 
period. All these seem to have marked the gradual transition of the 
Telugu poetry from the Pur ana to Prabandha, and have helped to 
usher in the classical period of Prabandha, which is also called the 
golden age of Telugu literature, during the memorable reign of 
Krishnadeva Raya. This will be discussed in the next volume. 

IV. MALAYALAM LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE 

Malayalam is today spoken by over ten million South Indians, 
largely concentrated in the State of Kerala and adjoining areas. 
It is the fourth of the Dravidian family of languages to attain matu¬ 
rity and chalk out a path for itself. As malai means ‘mountain’, 
the word ‘Malayalam’ obviously refers to either the people or the 
language or the government of the mountainous region. Till about 
a thousand years ago, Tamil was the language spoken in this region, 
doubtless with local variations. It is said that Malayalam as a dis¬ 
tinct language is not referred to in Tamil literature before the 
fifteenth century. 1 On the other hand, the Rama-charitam , which 
was composed in the fourteenth century, may be said to have inaugu¬ 
rated Malayalam literature just as Nanniah’s Mahabhdratam in¬ 
augurated Telugu literature. The fact is that dialectical and local 
peculiarities had already developed and stamped themselves in float¬ 
ing local songs and ballads. But these linguistic variations and 
phonetic peculiarities were at last gathered together and made to 
give a colouring to a sustained literary work, Rdma-charitam, there- 
by giving the new language a triumphant justification and a promis¬ 
ing lease of life. This, then, is roughly the story of Malayalam. 
Originally Malayalam was no more than a local dialect of Sen Tamil 
or Pure Tamil. Political isolation, local conflicts, the impact of 
Christianity and Islam, the arrival of the Nambudiri Brahmans a 
little over a thousand years ago, all created conditions favourable 
to an independent development of the local dialect. The Nambudiris 
grafted a good deal of Sanskrit on the local dialect and influenced 

529 


D. S.—*84 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


its physiognomy. Popular and religious songs were composed first. 
Presently, the phenomenal popularity of Kamban’s Tamil Ramdyana 
—it is said Kamban himself toured Kerala-desa and recited his 
Ramdyana before huge audiences—led in course of time to a similar 
version in the local dialect. Little by little, Tamil recognized the 
separate identity of Malayalam, and by the fifteenth century, the 
fact of separation is openly admitted. 


D. INDIAN CONTRIBUTION TO ARABIC LITERATURE 

Though Arabic is the language of the Qur’an, yet it failed to 
command the same amount of popularity in this country as Persian. 
After the Arab conquest of Sind, Mansur a, Daybul, and Multan 
were the first towns that became the seats of Islamic learning. Dur¬ 
ing the reign of Mas‘ud and other Ghaznavid Sultans, Lahore became 
the centre of Islamic culture and learning and produced many dis¬ 
tinguished scholars. It was during the reign of the Ghurls that 
the famous Shafi‘ite savant, Fakhr-ud-dln Muhammad bin ‘Umar- 
ar-RazI (A.D. 1150-1210) travelled to India. 1 During the rule of 
the Mamluk Sultans of Delhi, there flourished traditionists like 
Hasan as-Saghanl of Lahore (d. A.D. 1252), the Abbasid Ambassador 
to the court of Iltutmish and author of the Mashdriqu’l-Anwari’n- 
Nabaiviyyah and the lexicographical work ( Uddb? Great theo¬ 
logians and scholars like Ziya-ud-din Bayanawi 3 and QazI Mughls- 
ud-dln 4 flourished during the reign of the Khaljls. 5 

The great saint Nizam-ud-dln Auliya, the preceptor of Amir 
Khusrav, Hasan Dihlawi, Ziya-ud-din BaranI and other scholars 
lived during the reign of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khalji. It was during his reign 
that the erudite Egyptian theologian Shams-ud-dln came to India. 

Abu Bakr Ishaq, better known as Ibn Taj (died after A.D. 1335), 
was the son of Taj-ud-dm AbuT-Hasan of Multan. He wrote the 
Khulasatu Jaiudhiri’l-Qur’dn fl baydni Ma‘dni Lu9hati‘l-Furqdn and 
the Jawdhiru’l-Qur’an 6 on Qur’anlc literature, the Kitdbu’l Hajji- 
wal-Mandsik , 7 the Khuldsat-ul-Ahkdm bi S hard’ iti’l-I slam* and 
its abridged version Khulasatu Khuldsati’d-dm bi Shard’iti’l- 
Imani wa’i-Yaqin, on Fiqh, and the Zikr-uz-zikri’l-Akbar 9 and the 
Nisbatu Khirqati’t-Tasawwuf 10 on Islamic mysticism. 

Siraj-ud-din ‘Umar bin Ishaq al-Hindl (born c. A.D. 1314; died 
1372) was well-known for his profundity of knowledge in scholastic 
theology and jurisprudence. On account of his profound know¬ 
ledge in Islamic theology he was appointed QazI for some time at 
Cairo. 11 He figured as the author of several important treatises 


530

mostly on religious topics. He wrote the Zubdatu’l-Ahkam fi Ikhti-

his productions. 

Amir Sayyid ‘All b. Shihab-ud-dln bin Muhammad (A.D. 1314- 
1384), hailed from Hamadan. Jam! in his Nafahatu’l-Uns 19 has 
described him as an itinerant saint well-versed in both esoteric and 
exoteric learning. He wrote several treatises on Qur’anic subject, 
Hadis and Islamic mysticism. Some of these are Ar-Risalah fi’n- 
Nasikhi wa’l Mansukh, 20 as-Sab c in fi Fada’ili AmiVil-Mu’miriin, 21 
Mawaddatu fVl-Qurbd 22 Manazilu’s-Sdlikin 23 Sharhu’l-Asma VI- 
Husna, and Sharhu FususVl-Hikam. 

Sayyid Muhammad, son of Sayyid Yusuf Husaynl, better known 
as Glsu-daraz (A.D. 1321-1422), was one of the most popular saints 
in India. In 1412-13 he left for Gulbarga where he was held in 
great esteem by Firuz Shah Bahmanl and his successor Ahmad 
Shah. 24 The Sharhu’r-Risalati’l-Qushayriyyah 25 and ar-Risalatu fi 
Masd’ili RuyatVl-Ban Ta e ald 26 are written by him. 

The Shafi‘ite savant ‘All bin Ahmad Maha ? iml (d. A.D. 1431) 
of Arab extraction wrote the TabsinCr-Rahmdn wa Taystru’l-Mannayi 
(also known as Tafsir-i-Rahmani) 21 a commentary on the Qur’an. 
His Fiqh-i Makhdum! 28 is on Fiqh. 

Among the several works he wrote on various Sufi themes, men¬ 
tion may be made of the Mashra e iVl-Khusus ila Ma‘anVn-Nusus 
the Kashjwz-Zulamdt , the Istijla’u’l-Basar, the Nuru’l-Azhar, the 
Ta'ribu Lam‘dti’l-‘Iraqi and the Risdlatu’l-Wujud fi Sharhi Asma’i’l 
Ma‘bud. 

Sa‘d-ud-dln KhayrabadI (died A.D. 1477) wrote on Fiqh the 
Sharhu Usuli’l-Bazdavi and the Sharhu } l-Husdmi. The Risalatu’l - 
Makkiyyah on tasawwuf, and the philological works Sharhu’l- 
Kafiyah, Sharhu SharhVl-Jdmi and the Sharhu’l-Misbah are from his 
pen. 30 

Zayn-ud-din Abu Yahya b. Ali b. Ahmad al-Ma‘barI (A.D. 1468- 
1521) wrote many books on tasawwuf 31 The Hidayatu’l-Adhkiyd 3 
ild TariqVl'Auliyd, the Murshidu’t-Tulldb, and the Sirdju’l-Qulub 
are among his important works. 

Safl-ud-dln Muhammad, son of Abdur-Rahim al Hindi, (A.D. 
1246-1315) wrote the NhdyatiVl-Wusul ild e llmi’l-Usul 32 and the

FcL’iq ft Usuli’l-dm on Fiqh. Az-zubdan fi ‘Ilmi’l-Kaldm 33 on scholas¬ 
tic theology is another work by him. 

Qazi Shihab-ud-din, entitled a ‘Maliku’l-Ulama’, 34 (died c. A.D. 
1445), son of Shams-ud-dln, was born at Daultabad in the Deccan. 
After completing his studies at Delhi he went to Jaunpur where 
he was well received by Ibrahim Shah Sharqi. He was a distinguish¬ 
ed writer. On grammar he wrote al-Irshdd 35 and the SharhuV- 
Hindi 36 , a commentary on the Kafiyah. His Musaddiqu’l-Fazl is a 
copious commentary on Ka‘b bin Zuhayr’s famous panegyric Bdnat 
Su £ dd on Prophet Muhammad. He wrote the Sharhu Usuli’l-BazdawT 
on Fiqh and al- £ Aqa’idu’l-Islamiyyah 37 on Islamic dogma. 

Qazi Jamal-ud-dln Ahmad, better known as Bahraqu’l-Hazrami 
(d. A.D. 1522), a native of Hazramaut, was attached to the Court 
of Tabsimtu’l Hazrati’sh-Shdhiyyati’l’Ahmadiyyah bi Sirati’l-Haz - 
rati’n-Nabaiviyyati’l-Ahmadiyyah. 

The distinguished theologian Mu‘in-ud-din ‘Imran! 38 of Delhi, 
who flourished during the reign of Muhammad Tughluq (A.D. 1325- 
1351). was the author of several works on various subjects. The 
Hashiyaftala’t-Talwih 39 the Hdshiyah'ala’l’Husdmt 40 and the 
Hdshiyah £ ald Kanzi’d-Daqd’iq 41 are his works on Fiqh, while the 
Hdshiyatu’l-Miftdh 42 and the Hdshiyatu’t-Talkhis 43 are his philo¬ 
logical works. 

Sayyid Yusuf (A.D. 1388), the son of Sayyid Jamal-al-Husayni 
of Multan, lived during the reign of Firuz Shah Tughluq and was 
attached to the Royal College. His works, the Tawjihu’l-Kaldm ft 
Sharhi’l-Mandr and the Yusufl Sharhu Lubbi’l-Alabab ft ‘Ilmi’l- 
Frab 44 show his deep knowledge in Fiqh and grammar. 

Badr-ud-din Muhammad (b. A.D. 1424) of Egypt, better known 
as Ibn-ud-damamml, was the son of Abu Bakr al-Makhzumi al-Iskan- 
dari. After his pilgrimage to Mecca he came to Gujarat via Yaman 
in A.D. 1417. In Gujarat he wrote on grammar the TaTlquT- 
Fard’id, 45 a commentary on Ibn Malik’s work Tashilu’l-Fawd’id wa 
Takmtlu’l-Maqdsid,, and the Tuhfatu’l-Gharib, a commentary on Ibn 
Hisham’s M.ughni’l-Labtb 46 These were dedicated to Ahmad Shah 
of Gujarat. In A.D. 1422, he also wrote on his way to Ahmadabad 
(Gulbarga) al-Manhalu’s-Safi 41 a commentary on Muhammad b. 
Usman al-Balki’s work on grammar al-Wafi for Ahmad Shah Bah- 
mani. The Masdbthu’l-Jcimi‘fi Sharhi Sahihi’l-Bukhdri on Hadis is 
also from his pen. 

Safi bin Nasir, who lived during the reign of ‘Ala-ud-dm Khalji, 
wrote the Ghdyatu 3 t-Tahqiq 48 a super-commentary on Daulatabadi’s 
commentary on the Kdfiyah.

PERSIAN LITERATURE 


Khwaja Husain Nagurl (A.D. 1495), a descendant of QazI Hamld- 
ud-dln Nagurl, wrote the Nuru’n-Nabi on Qur’anic subject and the 
Sharhu’l-qismis-Thdlis Mina’l-Miftah on grammar. 

Ilah-dad of Jaunpur (A.D. 1525) wrote a commentary called the 
Hashiyah ‘ala Maddriki’t-Tanzil on the Qur’an and the Hashiyah 
‘ala Sharhi’l-Jami on grammar. 

It will be seen that during the period under review most of 
the authors who made any contribution to Arabic literature in 
India were Arabs and Persians or persons of Arab and Persian 
lineage. The contribution by the Indians themselves is rather small. 
Generally speaking, the works produced in India are on religious 
subjects, tasawwuj and grammar. They mostly comprise commen¬ 
taries on the Qur’an, Hadis, Fiqh and grammar. 49 

E. INDIAN CONTRIBUTION TO PERSIAN LITERATURE 

The invasion of India by Mahmud of Ghazni, though mainly a 
military movement, was not without its cultural importance in so 
far as it served to introduce Persian language and literature in 
India. Many poets and literati actually accompanied him in his 
campaigns. It was during his time that Abu Rayhan Muhammad 
al-Birunl, better known in Europe as Aliboron, came to India and 
made himself acquainted with Hindu learning. 

Under the Ghurlds, too, Persian language and literature thrived 
well. Taj-ud-dln Hasan, Rukn-ud-dln Hamza, Shihab-ud-din Muham¬ 
mad Rashid, poetically surnamed Shihab, NazukI of Maragha and 
QazI Hamid of Balkh were a few among the eminent poets and 
literati who shed lustre on the court of Muhammad Ghurl. 

The liberality of Qutb-ud-din (A.D. 1206-10) to the poets earned 
him the title of Lak-bakhsh (the giver of lacs 1 ). The sincere appre¬ 
ciation and patronage on the part of Iltutmish (A.D. 1211-36) at¬ 
tracted to his court poets and writers of the eminence of Khvaja 
Abu Nasr, poetically surnamed Nasiri, 2 Abu Bakar bin Muhammad 
Ruhani of Samarqand, 3 Taj-ud-dln Dablr 4 and Nur-ud-din Muhammad 
‘Awfi, the author of the earliest known memoir of Persian poets 
Lubdb-ul-Albdb and the Jawdmi-‘ul-Hikdydt wa Lawdmi- ur~ 
Riwdyat. 5 

Even the court of Nasir-ud-din Mahmud Shah (A.D. 1246-65) 
was graced by the panegyrist Fakhr-ud-dm Nunaki, poetically sur¬ 
named ‘Amid, 6 and the historian Minhaj-ud-din Juzajani, commonly 
known as Minhaj-i-Siraj 7 (b. A.D. 1193), the author of the Tabaqat-i 
Ndsiri, a general history from the earliest times to A.D. 1260.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The reign of the Sultans Ghiyas-ud-din Balban 8 and Mu‘izz-ud- 
din Kaiqubad as well as the period covered by the Khaljl and the 
Tughluq rule marked a new epoch in the history of Persian litera¬ 
ture in India. It was during their rule that eminent poets and 
writers like Khusrav flourished. 

The greatest Indian poet of Persian, Amir Khusrav, who had a 
precocious taste for poetry, was the youngest son of Saif-ud-din 
Mahmud, a Turk, who came to India during the early part of the 
reign of Sultan Nasir-ud-din Mahmud Shah (A.D. 1246-65). 

Amir Khusrav was born at Patiali near Delhi in A.D. 1253. At 
a very early age he “displayed an uncommon genius, a strong dispo¬ 
sition for study, and an aptitude for the acquirement of every science 
and even art, such as seldom has been witnessed”. His poetical 
genius was essentially lyric, though he tried his hand at all forms 
of poetry with remarkable success. He studied Sufi philosophy 
under the celebrated saint Shaikh Nizam-ud-din Auliya who was 
his spiritual preceptor. He was in the service of the Mamluk kings 
Ghiyas-ud-dln Balban and Mu‘izz-ud-din Kaiqubad; the Khalji kings 
Jalal-ud-dtn, ‘Ala-ud-din and Qutb-ud-din Mubarak Shah, and Ghiyas 
ud-din Tughluq. 

According to Amin Ahmad Razi, the author of the Haft Iqlim 
(The Seven Climes), Khusrav composed ninety-nine 9 works on differ¬ 
ent subjects. His Khamsa (Quintet), Panj Ganj, composed as a re¬ 
joinder to Nizami’s similar work, comprises the allegorical and 
mystical Matla-ul-Anwar (The Rising of the Lights) in 3310 verses, 
the two love-poems Shirin wa Khusrav in 4124 verses and Laila wa 
Majnun in 2360 verses, the A’ina-i Sikandari (The Mirror of 
Alexander) in 912 verses, and the Hasht Bihisht (The Eight Para¬ 
dises) in 3350 verses, dealing with the adventures of Bahram. This 
work earned him a monthly stipend of one thousand tankas for life. 
Reference has been made above to some of his compositions such as 
the Romance of Khizr Khan and Dewal Ram, composed in A.D. 1315, 
comprising 4200 verses, and the allegorical masnavi, Qirdn-us- 
Sa c dain (The conjunction of two Auspicious Planets). Nur-ul-Haqq, 
son of the celebrated divine ‘Abdul-Haqq of Delhi, wrote the Nur - 
ul- c Ain, a commentary on this masnavi. The Taj-ul-Futuh, a mas¬ 
navi poem, the Nuh Sipihr (The Nine Spheres) written in A.H. 718 
and dedicated to the Khalji Sultan Qutb-ud-din Mubarak, the Rasa } il 
Pjdz on prose composition, the Tughluq-nama, the Miftdh-ul-Futuh, 
the Afzal-ul-Fawd’id, the Tarikh-i-Dilhi and the Khaza y in-ul-Futuh, 
(a history of the reign of ‘Ala-ud-din Khalji) are some of his other 
works. 


534 


PERSIAN LITERATURE 


Khusrav died in A.D. 1325, as appears from the two chrono¬ 
grams e Adlm-ul-Misdl (the Unique) and the Tutiy-i-Shakkar Maqdl 
(The Sweet-spoken Parrot) contained in a poem by Shihab-i- 
Mu‘amma’I inscribed on the tomb-stone of the poet. 10 

Khvaja Najm-ud-din Hasan 11 of Delhi (b. A.D. 1253-54; d. 1326- 
27), son of ‘Ata’l Sanjarl, a friend of Amir Khusrav, was one of the 
court poets of Sultan ‘Ala-ud-din Khaljl. His lucid and charming 
Ghazals earned him the title of the ‘Sa‘dl of Hindusthan. 12 He was 
a favourite disciple of the celebrated saint Shaikh Nizam-ud-dln 
Auliya, whose utterances he recorded chronologically from A.D. 1307 
to 1322 under the title Fawcl’id-ul-Fu’ad which, according to ‘Abd-ul- 
Haqq, was the highest authority with the disciples of the saint. It 
is an authentic record of the instructive discourse on Sufi subjects 
delivered by the saint to his disciples. The historian Ziya-ud-dln 
Baranl, who was his contemporary, has spoken highly of his poetic 
gifts. The date of his death, as given by different writers, varies 
between A.D. 1307 and 1345. But according to Badaunl, when the 
citizens of Delhi were forced to move to the new capital Daulatabad 
about A.D. 1327 under the orders of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the 
poet went with them and died there. 13 

According to Firishta, other eminent poets of Persian who 
flourished during the reign of ‘Ala-ud-din Khaljl were Sadr-ud-dln 
‘All, Fakhr-ud-dln Qawwas. Hamld-ud-dln Raja, Maulana ‘Arif, 
Abdul-Haklm (‘Ubald Hakim) and Shihab-ud-din Sadr-nishin, all of 
whom had their divans . 14 

As noted above, Muhammad bin Tughluq (A.D. 1325-51) was a 
great patron of learning. It was during his reign that the great 
Moorish traveller Abu ‘Abdullah Muhammad, better known as Ibn 
Batutah, 15 came to India. 16 Ziya-ud-dln Baranl 17 (b. A.D. 1285), son of 
Mu’ayyid-ul-Mulk, was also attached to the court of Muhammad bin 
Tughluq for over seventeen years, but he lost the royal favour dur¬ 
ing the reign of Flruz Shah (A.D. 1351-88) due to the machination 
of his enemies and fell on evil days. He was a devoted disciple 
of saint Nizam-ud-dln Auliya and an intimate friend of Amir Khus¬ 
rav and Mir Hasan. He spent his last days in the composition of 
literary works. He died at a ripe old age and was buried close to 
the tomb of Nizam-ud-dln Auliya. According to the Siyar-ul-Auliya, 
he wrote the Sana-i-Muhammadl Saldtd-Kablr/Inayat-ncLma-i-llahl, 
Ma’dsir-i-Sa‘ddat and Hasrat-ndma. His Akhbdr-i-Barmakiydn giv¬ 
ing an anecdotical account of the Barmakids, was translated from 
the Arabic original in A.D. 1354 and dedicated to Flruz Shah. In 
A.D. 1357 he wrote the Tdrikh-i-Firuz Shdhl to which a detailed 
reference has been made above. 


535 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Attracted by the liberality of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq, 
Badr-ud-din Muhammad of Chach 18 (Arabicized Shash, also known 
as Banakit, modern Tashqand) came to India. For many years he 
was attached to the court of the Sultan whom he had panegyrized 
in his qasldas. His divan , containing chiefly qasldas, ghazals, qitfas 
and rubd ( ls , was lithographed at Lakhnau, in A.D. 1845. Lithograph 
editions of his qasldas were published from Kanpur (A.D. 1845) and 
Rampur (A.D. 1872). He also composed a Shahnama comprising 
about 30,000 verses, recording the expeditions of his patron. 

Tsami wrote in verse the Futuh-us-Salatln 19 on the model 
of Firdausi’s Shahnama dealing with the history of the rulers of India 
from the rise of the Ghaznavid dynasty to A.D. 1349-50. This work 
was dedicated to the founder of the Bahmanid dynasty, ‘Ala-ud-din 
Hasan Gangu (A.D. 1347-58). 20 

The successor of Muhammad bin Tughluq, his cousin Firuz Shah, 
was also a great patron of learning. This is attested by the fact that 
he granted annually one-third of a million pounds to learned men 
and pious endowments. He has left behind him the Futuhdt-i-Flruz 
Shdhl 21 in which he has recorded the edicts and ordinances, and 
works of public utility done by him 22 The poet Tzz-ud-din Khalid 
Khani, after collecting materials from the Sanskrit manuscripts 
found in the archives of the Jvalamukhi temple, wrote in verse his 
Dald’il-i-Firuz Shdhl on natural philosophy, auguries and omens 23 
He established many mosques, colleges, monasteries, etc. for the 
promotion of learning. 

Shams-i-Siraj ‘Afif 24 (d. A.D. 1398-99), following his precursor, 
Ziya-ud-din Barani, wrote the Tdrlkh-i-Flruz Shdhl, a history of the 
reign of Firuz Shah (A.D. 1351-88) in five parts, each comprising 
eighteen muqaddimas. It is a continuation of an earlier work of 
the same name by Ziya-ud-din Barani. It was edited by Maulavl 
Vilayat Husain in the Bibliotheca Indica series in A.D. 1890. 

Muhammad Bihamad Khani 25 wrote a general history, the 
Tdrlkh-i-Muhammadl, covering a period from the time of the Pro¬ 
phet to A.D. 1438-39. His father Bihamad Khan was in the service 
of Firuz Khan, the minister of Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq Shah II 
(A.D. 1388-89). In the latter part of his life the author, who was a 
soldier by profession, became a disciple of Shaikh Yusuf Budah 26 
(d. 1430-31) and led a saintly life. 

Yahya bin Ahmad of Sirhind compiled the Tdrlkh-i-Mubdrak 
Shdhl 21 for Mu'izz-ud-din Mubarak Shah II (A.D. 1421-34) of the 
Sayyid dynasty, to which reference has been made above. 27a 


536 


PERSIAN LITERATURE 


Being desirous of ascertaining his pedigree, Sayyid Mu‘In-ul- 
Haqq, son of Shihab-ul-Haqq, compiled the Manba-ul-Ansab , 28 a 
genealogical account of the Sayyids of Bhakhar in about A.D. 
1426-27, 

Ibrahim Qivam Faruql wrote a lexicon known as Farhang-i - 
Ibrdhlml 29 or Sharajndma-i-Ibrdhimi. Being a disciple of the cele¬ 
brated saint Sharaf-ud-dln Ahmad Muniarl, the author named his 
work Sharafndma-i-Ahmad Muniarl. This work has been mentioned 
as one of the sources of the later lexicographical works such as 
Tuhfat-us-Sa‘ddat, and Mu’ayyid-ul-Fuzala. It was compiled 
during the reign of Rukn-ud-dln Barbak Shah (A.D. 1459-74) of 
Bengal. 

Khvaja Mahmud Gavan, 30 the famous minister of the Bahmani 
kingdom and son of Shaikh Muhammad GllanI, came to India in 
A.D. 1455. Besides being a general and statesman he was an erudite 
scholar and poet. The Bahmani kings were all learned themselves, 
and were great patrons of learning. Among them Sultan Taj-ud- 
dln Flruz Shah (A.D. 1397-1422) stands foremost in learning. He 
took a keen interest in astronomy and ordered an observatory to 
be built at Daulatabad under the supervision of the eminent astro¬ 
nomers Hakim Hasan of Gllan and Sayyid Mahmud of Kazirun. 
But as ill-luck would have it, the work was never completed on 
account of the internal disturbances in the kingdom and the un¬ 
timely death of Hakim Hasan. Mahmud Gavan was on friendly terms 
with ‘Abdur-Rahman Jam! whom he once invited to visit the Deccan. 
He collected his letters in the form of a book called the Riyaz-ul-Inshd. 
He also wrote the Mandzir-ul-Insha on the art of literary composition 
and left a divan which is no longer extant. Mulla ‘Abdul Karim 31 
of Hamadan, who was attached to Mahmud Gavan, wrote a 
history of Gujarat called the Ma’asir-i-Mahmud Shahi, which 
Khvaja Nizam-ud-dln Ahmad mentions as one of his sources for his 
Tabaqdt-i-Akbarl? 2 

Fazlu’llah Zain-ul-‘AbidIn, entitled Sadar-i-Jahan, who was the 
son of Husain Ziya’I, flourished during the reign of Mahmud Begarha 
of Gujarat (A.D. 1458-1511). He wrote a general history known as 
the Tdrikh-i-Sadr-i-Jahdn covering the period from the earliest time 
to the 9th century A.H. The correct title of this history is not 
known. Incomplete manuscripts of this work are available in the 
British Museum. 33 

Mahmud Ayaz wrote the Miftdh-us-Surur-i-Adil Shahi 34 in 
about A.D. 1516, for his patron Yusuf ‘Adil Shah. This work deals 
with topics like sexual intercourse, peculiarities and properties of 
women, etc. 


537 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Muhammad bin Lad of Delhi compiled a valuable lexicon called 
the Mu’ayyid-ul-Fuzald 35 (Aids to Scholars). According to Bloch- 
mann it was written in A.H. 925 (A.D. 1519). This work, as claimed 
by the author, 36 is of great help for the study of Firdausi’s Shdhnama, 
Nizami’s Khamsa, Sanai’s poems and the divans of other classical 
poets. 

‘Abdullah bin Safi translated into Persian the Sanskrit work on 
farriery, Sdlihotra of Durgarasi, 37 by the order of the Bahmanid king 
Ahmad Shah I (A.D. 1422-36). The work begins with the “legendary 
account of the creation of the horse which is said to have been origi¬ 
nally endowed with wings.” 38 

Another treatise on the selection and treatment of horses was 
translated from the original Sanskrit Sdlihotra 39 during the reign of 
the Khaljl King of Malwa, Ghiyas-ud-dln (A.D. 1469-1500). It deals 
with the various breeds of horses, their blemishes, their diseases and 
cures, diet and food, etc. 

A treatise on Indian medicine called Ma‘dan-ush-Shija-i-Sikan- 
darl or Tibb-i-Sikandari 40 was compiled and translated from Sanskrit 
works by the Miyan Bhuvah, son of Khavas Khan. As Greek medi¬ 
cine was not suitable for Indian constitution, he wrote this work 
with the permission of Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1489-1517). 

Being prevailed upon by his friends, Mahmud bin Shaikh Ziya 
wrote a Persian dictionary called the Tuhfat-us-sa‘ddat Al in A.D. 
1510. The author dedicated this work to Sultan Sikandar Lodi and 
so it is also named Farhang-i-Sikandari. 

* Several Sanskrit works were translated into Persian,—a work 
on astronomy, as noted above, the Persian version of which, made 
by one ‘Azlz-ud-dln Khalid KirmanI was given the name of Dala‘il-i- 
Firuz Shdhi, and a work on music and dancing which was translated 
by ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Shams of Thaneswar. 42 The first masnavi in Hindi 
was also written during the Tughluq period. It contained the 
romantic story of Lorik and Chanda, adopted probably from a Sans¬ 
krit original. The work, which was dedicated to Juna Khan, son of 
the wazir , Khan-i-Jahan, became very popular, and, according to 
Badauni, a well known divine, Makhdum Taql-ud-dln Rabbani, used 
to recite verses from it while addressing the congregations for the 
Friday prayers. Other scholars were busy compiling theological 
works under the patronage of the kings of Jaunpur. Of these the 
names of Shihab-ud-dln Daulatabadi, the author of a Persian com¬ 
mentary of the Qur’an entitled Bahr-i-Mawwaj, who lived in the 
reign of Ibrahim Sharql, deserves special mention. He wrote several 
other works also and is reckoned among the foremost scholars of the 
pre-Mughul period. 


538 


PERSIAN LITERATURE 


*The period of Sayyid and Lodi kings (1414-1526) saw further 
development of the Muslim sciences, including philosophy. Many 
foreign scholars were attracted to Sultan Sikandar’s court on hearing 
the fame of his magnificence. Among them mention may be made of 
Rafi-ud-dln Shlrazi, an Iranian scholar of considerable repute. Philo¬ 
sophic studies were specially promoted in the capital by the arrival 
there of two scholars, Shaikh ‘Abdullah TulanbI and Shaikh ‘Azlzullah 
from Multan, who had already established a centre in the latter city. 
This was during the reign of Sikandar Lodi, in some respects the 
greatest of the Lodi monarchs and a generous patron of poets and 
scholars. He was himself a poet and wrote fairly elegant verses 
under the pen-name of Gulrukhl. Reference has already been made 
above to two works, based on Sanskrit originals, written during his 
reign. - 

*The greatest poet of the Lodi age was Shaikh Jamal-ud-dln of 
Delhi, entitled Shaikh Jamal! Kanboh, who had travelled widely and 
had met the great Persian master, Jam!, at Herat. He lived to see the 
fall of the Lodi kingdom and the installation, on the throne of Delhi, 
of Babur whom he has praised in some of his odes. He is the author 
of two well-known works, the Siyar-ul-Arifin and the masnavi, 
Mihr-u-Mcih. This period produced the well-known Sufi Saint, 
‘Abdul Quddus of Gangoh who incurred the displeasure of Babur by 
his support to the hapless Lodi king, Sultan Ibrahim, who died fight¬ 
ing in the fateful battle of Panipat in 1526. His tomb is counted 
among the most important Muslim shrines in India, and attracts a 
large number of visitors. 

Reference has been made above 43 to the literary contributions of 
the Sufis in India. Ibn Batutah reports in his Rehlah that he met 
different Sufis during his visit to Ceylon and India. 44 During the 
period under review Muslim saints made an important contribution 
towards the development of Persian language and literature in 
India. 

Sharf-ud-dln bu-‘AlI Qalandar (d. A.D. 1324) wrote the Maktu- 
bdt (Epistles), the Hikmatnama (The Book of Wisdom), the 
Hukmnama-i-Shaikh bu-All Qalandar (The Commands of bu- e All 
Qalandar), and the Masnavl-i-bii-All Qalandar. 

Khvaja Muhammad Imam 45 (d. A.D. 1335), the grandson of

ceptor Nizam-ud-din Auliya in his Fawd’id-ul-Fu’ad 46 (Profitable to 
the Heart). 

Ziya-ud-din BaranI (already mentioned before), also a disciple 
of Nizam-ud-dln Auliya and the author of the famous historical work 
Tdrikh-i-Firuz Shdhi, wrote his own mystical experience under the 
title of the Hasratndma (Book of Regret). 

Farid-ud-din 47 (d. A.D. 1351) wrote the Surur-us-Sudur (Plea¬ 
sure of Hearts), a collection of the sayings of Hamld-ud-din Naguri. 

Ziya-ud-din Nakhshabi 48 (d. A.D. 1350), the vicegerent of 
Shaikh Farid, was the author of the Silk-us-Suluk (The Mystic Path) 
and the Sharh-i-Du e d-i-Surydrii (Explanation of a Syrian Prayer). 

The authorship of the Addb-ut-Talibin (The Ways of the 
Seekers) and the Intibdh-ul-Mundin (The Awakening of the Disci¬ 
ples) is attributed to Nasir-ud-din C-hiragh-i-Dihli. 49 

The authorship of the Khair-ul-Majdlis (The Best of the Assem¬ 
blies), which contains a collection of the sayings of Nasir-ud-din 
Chiragh-i-Dihli, is ascribed to Hamid-ud-din Qalandar (d. A.D. 1367). 

Sayyid Muhammad 50 bin Mubarak Kirmani (d. A.D. 1368), a 
disciple of Nasir-ud-din Chiragh-i-Dihli, was the author of the Siyar- 
ul-Auliyd (Lives of Saints). 

Yusuf Gada (d. 1372), who also was one of the disciples of Nasir- 
ud-din Chiragh-i-Dihli, wrote the Tuhfat-un-Nasd’in 51 (A Gift of 
Admonitions) in A.D. 1351 for his son Abu-T-Fath. This work 
deals with the duties and observances of a Muslim. 

‘Abdul Muqtadir (d. A.D. 1389), who sat at the feet of the same 
illustrious saint, was the author of the Mandqib-us-Siddiqm 
(Virtues of the Confirmers of Truth) which contains an account of 
saints of the Chishti order. 

Shaikh Sharaf-ud-din Ahmad bin Yahya (d. A.D. 1381) of Mun- 
yar, a village in Bihar, was the disciple of Shaikh Najib-ud-din 
Firdausi. 52 He is said to have written many treatises on Islamic 
mysticism. Among them are the Irshad-us-Sdlikm wa Burhan-ul - 
c A^ifin 53 on the principles of Sufiism and the Fawd’id-i-Rukni 54 on 
Sufi Doctrines. Zain Badr ‘Arab! collected his epistles on Sufi 
topics under the title of Maktubat. 55 

Mir Sayyid Ashraf Jahangir Simnani 56 (d. circa A.D. 1436-37) 
was the author of two treatises on Sufiism, namely Bashdrat-ul- 
Muridtn (Glad Tidings for the Disciples) and the Maktubat 
(Epistles). 

Sayyid Muhammad, better known under his surname Gisu- 
daraz 57 (A.D. 1321-1422), was a favourite disciple of Nasir-ud-din

LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE 


Chiragh-i-Dihll, whose sayings he collected under the title of 
Jawdmi-ul-Kilam. Flruz Shah Bahmanl and his successor Ahmad 
Shah held him in great esteem. 58 

Shir Khan Bak (put to death in A.D. 1397-8), poetically 
surnamed Mas’ud, 39 was the disciple of Shaikh Rukn-ud-dln bin 
Shihab-ud-dln Imam. He wrote the Yusuf wa Zulaikhd , imitation 
of Jami’s work of the same name, and the Mir’at-ul-Arifin (Mirror 
of the Mystics). 

Sayyid Muhammad 60 bin Ja’far (d. A.D. 1486), who had the 
honour of being the chief disciple of Naslr-ud-dm Chiragh-i-Dihll 
wrote several treatises on religious subjects. On Sufiism he wrote 
the Bdhr-ul-Ma c dni (Ocean of Mystical Meanings), containing thirty- 
six letters dealing with various Sufi topics, and Asrdr-i-Ruh on 
the mysteries of soul. 61 

It will be seen that during the period under discussion the con¬ 
tributors to Persian learning in India were mostly Persians by 
nationality or persons of Persian origin. The foundation was never¬ 
theless well laid for a Persian literature—historical, literary and 
religious—which was destined to exercise a potent and appreciable 
influence on the contemporary and later languages, literatures and 
religious thoughts of India. 

The art of writing history, which Persian learning brought in 
its trail, proved fruitful in setting a good example to the country 
which, from this period onward, produced historical records in 
different parts and provinces.

2. De, HSU. 332; Krishnamachariar ( HCSL . 210) gives the number as 7.

4. Rukmimkalydna by Rajachudamani DIkshita pertains to the seventeenth 
century.

patronage of king Adityavarman (15th century), wrote the Ramakatha, 
Govindacharita and many other works. 

8a. Above pp. 85-6.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


15. If Vidyaranya mentioned in the play be identical with the famous scholar of 
Vijayanagara it can be assigned to the middle of the 14th century ( HCSL . 651). 

16. Visvarupa Krishnabhatta has written a drama Murarivijaya on the same theme 
0CC, I. 462; II. 106). 

17. The kings of Vijayanagara were authors of many works, and so were their 
court poets, the Dindimas. 

18. This short drama forms the third chapter of Prataparudrayasobhushana written 
by Vidyanatha in honour of his patron. 

19. E. V. V. Raghavacharya ( JVORI, II. 85 ff) places Varadacharya in the 14th 
century, while De would place him “in the latter half of the 17th and the 
beginning of the 18th century” (HSL. 487, fn. 3), and Krishnamachariar “in 
the latter half of the 18th century” (HCSL. 665). 

20. Chatter ji, POC, IV, 2. 556; De, HSL. 497. Keith (SD 261) identifies the king 
(wrongly named as Narasimha in some MSS) with Narasimha of Vijayanagara. 
See also Gode, SILH, I. 378. For the date of Harasimha see above, p. 398. 

21. Cf. Krishnamachariar, HCSL. 665 and 243. 

22. Among the very late dramas may be mentioned the HaTagaurlvivdha of 
Jagajjyotirmalla of Nepal, the Sridamacharita of Samaraja DIkshita, the 
J anaklparinaya of Ramabhadra DIkshita, the Adbhutadarpana of Mahadeva 
(depicting the happenings at Lanka in a magic mirror), the Anandasundarl of 
Ghanasyama and the Sringdramanjari of Visvesvara, both being of the Sattaka 
type, the Kautukaratnakara of Lakshmana Manikyadeva and the Dhurtanar- 
taka of Samaraja DIkshita, both being Prahasanas, the Saradatilaka of Sankara, 
and the Srihgarasarvasva of Nallakavi which are Bhanas of the usual type- 

23. For versions of the Brihatkatha, see Vol. V, p. 313 f. 

24. Rudradhara, who was a pupil of Chandesvara and the author of Kritya- 
chandrika, Vivddachandrika and Sraddhachandrikd, appears to be a different 
person. ( KHDS, I. 398). 

25. For eleven works with the title Chintamani and five with Nirnaya, see 
KHDS, I. 399-402. 

26. For the date of his two patron kings, see above, p. 407. This Vachaspati is 
often confounded with the great philosopher Vachaspati, author of Bhamatl 
and several philosophical works, who flourished in the ninth century (Vol. IV, 
p. 203 ff). Another Vachaspati, author of Smritisdrasamgraha, flourished in 
the latter half of the 18th century. KHDS, I. 405. 

27. Cf. KHDS, I. 394.

31a. The date of Vijhanabhikshu is given as second half of the sixteenth century 
and middle of the seventeenth, respectively, by Winternitz (GIL, III. 457) and 
Keith (HSL. 489) (Ed.). 

32. Cf. Gode, PO, IX. 11-19. 

33. Vol. V, p. 320. 

34. Not 1437 as wrongly interpreted by Stein and followed by some scholars. Cf. 
Kane, HSP. 296; also, Gode, ABORI, XVI. 145-7. 

35. Dr. Raja refutes the views of Krishnamachariar that the authors of Rasdrna- 
vasudhakara and the commentary on Sangltaratndkara were different, and that 
Visvesvara was the author of Rasdrnavasudhdka'ra. (Raja, Sangltarat'ivdkara, 
intr. xvii; Krishnamachariar, HCSL. 771). 

35a. For the Reddi Kings, see p. 363. 

36. Madras Catalogue. XXII, No. 12965, pp. 8708-10. Tanjore Catalogue (IX.

37. De, SP, I. 237; Krishnamachariar, HCSL. 773. 

38. Sangltaratnakara, intr. xi. HCSL. 853. 

39. Hammlra, who refers to Jaitrasimha as an earlier writer in his Sanglta-

Chapter XVI 

RELIGION 

A. General Review 

We have a fairly definite idea of the religious condition of India 
at the opening of the fourteenth century. Buddhism had practically 
disappeared, as a separate religious sect, from the land of its birth, 
and the hold of Jainism was confined to a narrow region in the west. 
Islam was yet confined to a number of scattered settlements in 
Northern India and a fringe of South Indian coast. The orthodox 
Brahmanism reigned supreme over nearly the whole of India, but 
it had ceased to be a homogeneous sect, and was practically a hetero¬ 
geneous compound of the relics of the various developments in the 
past to which reference has been made in the preceding volumes. 
One great peculiarity of Indian culture is that it adds to, but seldom 
altogether supersedes, the old institutions, and faithfully preserves, 
as far as possible, all relics of the past, even though they are hidden, 
or changed beyond recognition, by later growths. Leaving aside 
the minor sub-sects we still find the religion of the Vedic period with 
all its sacrificial rituals minutely preserved and even elaborated by 
the Mimamsa School, side by side with the powerful major sects of 
the Vaishnavas, Saivas, Saktas and Tantrikas (including Buddhist 
Sahajiyas), together with their sub-sects, and various other minor 
religious sects and popular cults mentioned in the preceding volumes. 

But the most characteristic feature of the religious evolution 
of the period was the prominence attained by a number of devotees 
who are generally labelled as saints or mystics. These medieval 
saints, who have shed a lustre on the age, possessed certain distinc¬ 
tive characteristics in common. They were non-sectarian in the 
sense that they were not affiliated to, or at least were not leading 
members of, any particular sect, and had no desire to establish a 
separate religious sect of their own. These saints were free from 
the bondage of any particular creed and had not blind faith in any 
sacred scriptures: they attained illumination by individual exer¬ 
tion through freedom of thought and self-culture. They did not 
observe any rituals or ceremonies, nor followed any dogma, and 
most of them severely denounced idolatry. They condemned poly¬ 
theism, believed in one God, and, what is more important, realized 
the unity of God invoked by various religious sects under different 
names such as Krishna, Rama, !§iva, Allah, etc. They believed in 


547 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


bhakti (love or devotion) as the only means of salvation, and gave 
a very comprehensive interpretation and profoundly psychological 
analysis of the conception of bhakti• This may be said to be their 
chief and permanent contribution to the religious thoughts of India. 
With them bhakti meant single-minded, uninterrupted and extreme 
devotion to God without any ultimate motive ( ahaituki ), growing 
gradually into an intense love. This love was akin to love of a man 
for dear and near ones, and is graded by some into clear categories 
by analogies with human relations, such as devotion of a servant 
to a master, love between friends, affection of a mother for a child, 
and lastly the all-absorbing passion of a lover for his beloved. Brah¬ 
man, the Supreme God, or ultimate reality, called as Rama, Hari, 
Krishna and by any other name or abstract idea, was the source of 
all joys or eternal bliss, and was conceived as the supreme beloved. 
God, it was maintained, does not live in a temple but in the heart 
of man, and the physical body was regarded as the abode of all 
truth. The realization of all this, and the approach to God through 
personal love and devotion alone, form the foundation of religious 
life. It is not, of course, an easy task, and requires purification of 
body and mind from all sins. All this is hard to achieve without the 
help of a guru or religious preceptor. But even a guru, however 
spiritually illumined he may be, cannot lead to salvation or final 
emancipation, which depends on the grace ( prasdda ) of God. For 
this purpose a complete self-surrender ( prapatti ) to Him on the part 
of the devotees is absolutely necessary. 

These saints took into account the whole personality of man 
and therefore did not unduly emphasize his rational faculty. Reli¬ 
gious truths and beliefs, they held, were not matters of pure reason 
alone, and a man’s passional and volitional nature must also be re¬ 
garded as a valid contributing factor. In any case it should not be 
“rejected or excluded so long as it is not in direct conflict with the 
rational instincts of man. 

These are, in brief, the essential principles preached by these 
saints, through simple aphorisms, parables, and maxims which 
brought home to even ordinary and uneducated persons the uni¬ 
versal truths which were considered more valuable than sectarian 
doctrines or scriptural texts. As a rule these saints preached 
through vernaculars, rather than Sanskrit, for they wanted to up¬ 
lift the masses. The same noble object led them to do away with 
the invidious distinctions of caste and bestow special care and atten¬ 
tion upon the degraded and depressed classes. 

The latitudinarianism, freedom of thought, and intense self- 
exertion in intellectual and spiritual spheres, which characterized 


548 


RELIGION 


the saints, undoubtedly generated in them a spirit of revolt and 
criticism, and no wonder that in spite of a frank recognition of 
their greatness, they or their followers were not always accorded a 
place within the orthodox fold. For this reason, if not for others, 
the followers of many of the saints were formed into close sects, 
against their avowed policy. Even when the followers of heterodox 
sects were accepted or tolerated, in course of time, by the orthodox 
section, they had to shed some of their characteristics, specially the 
heterodox views about castes or worship of images. Chaitanya’s 
Vaishnavism is even today a powerful factor in the religious life of 
Bengal; but the spirit with which the great leader embraced the 
Chandalas and Muslims and admitted them as his disciples, vanished 
long ago, and there is hardly any outward distinction today between 
a Vaishnava and an orthodox smarta Brahmana in Bengal. This has 
been the fate of the followers of most of the saints of Medieval 
India. The sect founded by Nlanak, though numerically small and 
confined to a narrow geographical area, is today the most powerful 
one that represents the idea of the medieval saints in this respect. 
It must be recognized, however, that it derives its importance, to a 
very large extent, from causes other than religious or spiritual. For 
the rest, the other great saints, whose followers have survived as 
separate entities, are represented today only by small scattered 
groups forming an insignificant element in the large body of Hindu¬ 
ism. These mystic saints have undoubtedly leavened the thoughts 
of India, but it is difficult to determine the nature and extent of 
their permanent influence on Hinduism. In any case, they failed 
to modify either the religious ideas and practices or the outward 
structure of the Hindu society to any appreciable extent. 

The one great factor which facilitated the assimilation or ab¬ 
sorption of the teachings of medieval saints was that their root lay 
deep into the soil of India. It would appear on a close analysis 
that there was nothing new in their fundamental conceptions. The 
belief in the unity of God, discarding of worship of images, and 
bhakti as the mode of salvation, were familiar concepts in India. 
The first two can be traced as far back as the time of the Rigveda, 
and have persisted throughout the ages side by side with a belief in 
the worship of a plurality of gods. This is best illustrated, in a prac¬ 
tical manner, by the fact that Raja Ram Mohan Ray, in the nineteenth 
century, placed his doctrine of unqualified monotheism, bereft of 
rituals and idolatry, on the foundation of the Vedas and Upanishads, 
and not on any outside philosophy and religious system. 

As to the cult of bhakti preached by the medieval saints, it was 
developed to a large extent by the Vaishnava sects during the early 


549 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


centuries of the Christian era, and formed an important element 
in their doctrines ever since, as has been shown in the preceding 
volumes. Some of the characteristic doctrines of the medieval saints 
are echoed in the Upanishads. The following passage, occurring in 
two separate Upanishads, may serve as an example: 

“That Self cannot be gained by the Veda, nor by understanding, 
nor by much learning. He whom the Self chooses, by him the 
Self can be gained. The Self chooses him (his body) as his own”. 1 

Here we find the doctrine of grace coupled with a disbelief in 
the efficacy of scriptures as a means to salvation. The Upanishads 
also describe Brahman as being of the nature of bliss and the source 
of all human joys. The doctrine of prapatti (self-surrender) is also 
echoed in the Gita (XVIII. 66) in which Krishna says: “Give up all 
religious paths, and take refuge in me alone. I shall deliver thee 
from all sins. Sorrow not”. The later Vaishnava literature—all 
earlier than the tenth century A.D.—not only develops and empha¬ 
sizes the doctrines of prasuda and prapatti, but also defines bhakti 
as of the nature of intense love for god. The different grades and 
categories of such love, as mentioned above, culminating in that of 
the lover for the beloved, form the theme of texts like Bhagavata 
Parana and a somewhat later text, Jayadeva’s Glta-Govinda (12th 
century A.D.). It is clear, therefore, that all the fundamental spiri¬ 
tual ideas of the medieval saints are expounded in the standard and 
well-known religious texts of the Hindus. Even the preaching in 
vernaculars and disregard of castes were the legacies of heterodox 
sects like Buddhism and Jainism. As a matter of fact the Sahajiya 
cult—the latest form of Buddhism—,which can be traced back to the 
tenth and eleventh centuries A.D., bears a very close resemblance 
to the medieval mysticism, both in its spiritual and social aspects. 
The medieval saints, therefore, cannot be said to have introduced 
any new tenet. But their credit lies in the fact that by their pre¬ 
cepts, and more by their examples, they placed the pure doctrine 
of bhakti on a high pedestal, above all rituals, ceremonies, and secta¬ 
rian faiths and beliefs, and emphasized the role of intense, uninter¬ 
rupted and unmotived love of God as the sole means of salvation. 
At a time when religious ideas tended to become dry, lifeless, and 
static, and rituals and ceremonialism took the place of spiritual en¬ 
lightenment, the teachings and personalities of the saints galvanized 
the inert masses. 

It must be understood, however, that the medieval mysticism, 
based upon bhakti , did not suddenly come into prominence during 
the period under review. Its origin can be traced to an earlier 
period, and the two great preachers of Maharashtra, Jnanadeva and 


550 


RELIGION 


Namadeva, are justly regarded as precursors of the great move¬ 
ment. As their social and religious views have been discussed in 
connection with the history of Marathi literature in the preceding 
volume, 2 they are not separately discussed in this chapter. But 
they rank very high as mystic saints of Medieval India. 

We find a parallel movement in Islam in the development of 
Sufiism, the origin and progress of which in India have been describ¬ 
ed above. 2a The Muslim mystics or Sufis were men of deep reli¬ 
gious feelings, who led ascetic lives and laid emphasis on the prac¬ 
tices of self-discipline as preparing the human for the intuitive know¬ 
ledge of God. They soon developed a loving devotion to God with 
an element of ecstasy, and belief in the immanence of God in the 
sense that “all is in God”. A further development is to be found 
in the doctrine of ‘fana’, the annihilation of the Self, which means 
the annihilation of human attributes through union with God. They 
believed in soul, a spiritual substance, different from the body but 
akin to the universal soul. These were regarded as heretic doctrines 
and many Sufi preachers had to sacrifice their lives for the sake 
of their faith, though they regarded themselves as devout Muslims. 

The Sufi doctrine was not only widely propagated in the Islamic 
world, but also further developed on Indian soil. Nizam-ud-din 
Auliya, to whom reference has been made above in connection with 
Muhammad Tughluq, was one of the greatest Sufis of the ChishtI 
order in India and a mighty spiritual force. He laid stress on the 
element of love as a means of the realization of God. The love of 
God implied, in his view, the love of humanity, and this ethical idea 
was strongly inculcated by him on the hearts of his disciples. His 
deep attachment to the idea of universal love is manifest from the 
following utterance: “O Muslims! I swear by God, that He holds 
dear those who love Him for the sake of human beings, and also 
those who love human beings for the sake of God. This is the only 
way to love and adore God.” 3 So the Sufis came to regard the service 
of humanity as part of mystic discipline. Some Sufis justified the 
pursuit of music, not sanctioned by orthodox Islam, on the ground 
that “a Sufi is a lover of God, and as such he stands in a different 
relation to God from others who are merely “ ‘dbd” or slaves. As 
music inflames the fire of love and helps in creating the supreme 
state of ecstasy it is permissible for those who have discretion.” 33 

The Sufis were devout Muslims who moved within the limits of 
Shar‘ (Law of Islam) and believed it as the true way to salvation. 
They however “attached an esoteric significance to the teachings of 
Qur’an” and regarded inward light or intuitive experience as of far 
more importance than dogmatic formalism of the orthodox type. 4 


551 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The orthodox Muslims depend upon external conduct while the Sufis 
seek inner purity. The orthodox believe in blind obedience to, or 
observance of, religious rituals, while the Sufis think love to be the 
only means of reaching God. 5 

The origin of medieval mysticism has formed a subject of keen 
and protracted discussion. Eminent European scholars like Weber 
held that the idea of hhakti as a means and condition of salvation 
was borrowed from Christianity. Similarly, Grierson regarded the 
monotheistic doctrine as a Christian idea. These are not regarded 
seriously by any scholar today. But the idea of borrowing is by no 
means dead, and Isliam is now substituted for Christianity as the 
source of both the ideas. 

As has been demonstrated above, the fundamental doctrines of 
the medieval saints, including hhakti in the shape of an intense love 
for, and a belief in, one God, have been deep-rooted ideas on Indian 
soil, and nothing but the strongest positive evidence should incline 
one to accept the view that the medieval saints were indebted to 
Christianity, Islam or any other source. The evidence of such a 
close contact with Christianity as may reasonably support the idea 
of borrowing from each other is entirely lacking. The question is 
more complicated in regard to Islam. The contact between Islam 
and Hindu religious ideas before the twelfth century A.D. was so 
few and far between, that the chance and possibility of mutual in¬ 
fluence in respect of philosophic views and fundamental religious 
doctrines are very remote indeed. The opinion of some scholars that 
§ahkaracharya’s monism was influenced by Islam would hardly com¬ 
mend itself to anybody. Things were, however, different from the 
thirteenth century onwards, when Islam established itself in India 
and dug its roots more and more deeply as centuries rolled by. There 
can be hardly any doubt that the impact of Islam was felt by the 
Hindus, and a class of Muslim thinkers was influenced by the rich 
heritage of thought in India. It is not, however, always easy to 
determine either the nature or the extent of the reciprocal influence, 

u *. ,. r . V" " ‘ - ' *• ti 

for, from the very nature of the case, positive or clear evidence is 
almost always lacking. 6 A comparison of the changes undergone 
by Hinduism and Islam by the end of the eighteenth century, when 
strong influence from the West began to modify their character still 
further, may perhaps give us some clear idea of the more or less 
permanent and substantial results of the mutual influence. Until 
such comparison is made, it is unwise to be dogmatic, one way or 
the other, even in respect of the period under review. 

There is a strong body of opinion in favour of the view that 
medieval mysticism in India was mainly the result of the impact of 


: 552 


RELIGION 


Islam. The protagonists of this view may be broadly divided into 
two classes, according as they regard the influence of Islam as the 
direct or the indirect cause. 

It has been urged, for example, that Ramananda, with whom 
the medieval mysticism may be said to begin, “must have acquired 
knowledge of Islamic ideas, and perhaps was unconsciously inspired 
by them”. 7 It is difficult either to prove or to disprove such a vague 
general statement. The same writer further observes that “the 
Bhakti movement of medieval India represents the first effective 
impingement on Hindu society of Islamic culture and outlook”. 8 
He admits that the “Bhakti cult was essentially indigenous” to India, 
but believes that “medieval Bhakti was radically new and basically 
different from old traditions and ideas of religious authority”. In 
particular he lays stress on the principles of “universal brotherhood 
and human equality”, 9 preached by Islam, and its “new social mes¬ 
sage of the worth of every human being in the sight of God”. 10 It 
is, however, to be pointed out that the brotherhood of Islam did not 
extend beyond its own fold and can, by no stretch of imagination, 
be regarded as universal, if we accept the ordinary meaning of the 
word. According to Muslim tenets, the non-believers or Kafirs oc¬ 
cupied a distinctly inferior position. Theoretically speaking, no 
religion or philosophy preached the universal brotherhood of man 
more eloquently than the Vedanta, which placed it on the funda¬ 
mental basis of the identity of all individual souls, all being identical 
with Brahman. Of course, there was no practical application of this 
doctrine in social life. But neither the theory of Islam, nor 
its practice, as regards the Hindus, could appeal to the latter as 
bringing a new message of equality of men. The Hindus of the 
medieval age could be under no illusion on this point when they 
were forbidden to perform their own religious rites in public, denied 
political and civic rights on equal terms, and when Islam, as the 
State religion, could impose its legal system upon them. It would 
be idle to pretend, therefore, that the equality or brotherhood of 
Islam could have any other effect than a willing conversion to that 
faith in order to escape the rigorous distinctions of Hindu society 
and religion. As regards “old traditions and ideas of religious 
authored’, the medieval saints could hardly find much difference 
between the orthodox Islam and orthodox Hinduism. 

It is therefore hard to believe that medieval mysticism could 
owe much to the direct influence of orthodox Islam. It has been 
suggested that the somewhat heterodox views, beliefs, and practices 
of the Sufi sect of Islam had great influence over the medieval saints. 
There are undoubtedly some striking common features between the 


553 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


two, in particular the stress on the approach to God through love, 
intellect and intellectual life being regarded not only as valueless 
but almost as a positive hindrance. Among other similarities may 
be noted (1) physical exercises like restraining of breath, (2) service 
and submission to pir or guru, (3) recitation of sacred words, (4) tole¬ 
ration of other religions, and (5) belief in union with the Supreme 
Being through love and bhakti. The general liberal and unorthodox 
attitude regarding rituals and ceremonies is also another point com¬ 
mon between them. It has been pointed out that not only in ideo¬ 
logy, but also in the poetic representation of the same, there is a 
general similarity between the poetry of the medieval saints and 
Sufi poets on the one hand and the Buddhist Sahajiyas on the other. 
It is therefore argued that medieval mysticism is a product of the 
reaction of Sufiism against the Sahajiya background. 

Though we must be cautious in making any dogmatic assertion 
of this kind, there is undoubtedly a great degree of plausibility in 
this view. It is hardly likely, from the very nature of the case, that 
orthodox Hinduism and orthodox Islam would act and react on each 
other, at least to any appreciable extent, and there is no tangible 
evidence of it. But the radical wings of the two are more likely to 
provide a common meeting ground, and such evidence as we possess 
seems to favour the view. One may therefore reasonably believe 
in a close contact between the two and their deep influence on each 
other, resulting in the evolution of what may be called medieval 
saints or mysticism. But it is not easy to determine in what way 
they affected each other, and how much each contributed to the 
result. In any case we have no reason to take it for granted that 
there was only one way traffic and Sufiism imposed itself upon 
Sahajiya. Nor is it necessary to exclude other factors, such as the 
normal evolution of religious ideas, in order to explain the rise and 
growth of medieval mysticism. 

This brings us to the views of another class of writers who trace 
the origin of medieval mysticism to the indirect influence of Islam. 
According to this view, the presence of such a strong proselytising 
religion as Islam was a serious challenge to Hinduism, which “in¬ 
spired the religious men of India also to seek more earnestly for the 
truths of their own faith”. 11 The position may be likened to the 
danger threatened by Christianity at the beginning of the nineteenth 
century. A class of reformers, beginning with Raja Ram Mohan 
Ray, arose among the Hindus, to avert this danger, by eradicating 
what they conceived to be evils in the religious ideas and social 
practices of the time. But they sought to purify from within, on 
the basis of what they regarded as pure forms of Hinduism. The 


554 


RELIGION 


stimulus was supplied by the impact of a foreign religion, but the 
reforms were based on Hinduism and not borrowed from Christianity. 
Something like this might have happened at the time of the first 
contact with Islam, and medieval mysticism may be viewed as an 
attempt of the same type though not of the same form, as was 
made by the Brahma Samaj and other reformist sects of the nine¬ 
teenth century. It is interesting to note that polytheism, idolatry, 
caste, etc., which were obvious targets of attack both by Islam and 
Christianity, formed the chief planks of reform both in the fourteenth 
and in the nineteenth century. 

This view has as much, if not more, to commend itself as any 
other view so far advanced to explain the origin of the medieval 
mysticism. It also serves to give us an idea of the result of the 
impact of Islam and Hinduism on each other. Brahmaism, in one 
aspect, was an attempt to establish a link between Hinduism and 
Western Society by removing such rules of caste as prohibited inter- 
dining and intermarriage. The social views of medieval saints may 
be looked upon as a similar attempt to bridge the wide gulf that 
separated the two great communities, Hindus and Muslims, inhabit¬ 
ing the same land. But the attempts of both ended in failure. The 
medieval mysticism, like Brahmaism of later days, hardly effected 
any breach in the citadels of either orthodox Hinduism or orthodox 
Islam. Both were restricted to an insignificant minority of the 
population and gradually languished as an effective instrument of 
reform. The analogy need not be pursued any further, but the well- 
known historic origin of the Brahma Samaj and its general course 
may offer suitable explanation of the rise and progress of medieval 
mysticism. 

In conclusion it may be pointed out that the role of both 
medieval mysticism and Sufiism in the history of Indian culture is 
often exaggerated beyond all proportions. Whatever might have 
been the value of either as a distinctive phase of Hinduism and 
Islam, from moral, spiritual and philosophical points of view, their 
historical importance is considerably limited by the fact that the 
number of Indians directly affected by them, even at their heyday 
which was shortlived, could not be very large. The number dwindl¬ 
ed very appreciably in course of time, and the two orthodox religions 
showed no visible sign of being seriously affected by this sudden 
intrusion of radical elements. They pursued their even tenor, re¬ 
sembling the two banks of a river, separated by the stream that 
flows between them. Attempts were made to build a bridge con¬ 
necting the two, but ended in failure. Even if there were any 
temporary bridge, it collapsed in no time.

B. SAIVISM. 

The rise of Vijayanagara gave a great impetus to Saivism. The 
early kings of Vijayanagara were ardent Saivas and, as mentioned 
above, they ruled the kingdom as vicegerents of their patron-deity, 
Virupaksha. 11 * Virupaksha was regarded by the Royal House of 
Vijayanagara as the “city-God and the empire-God”. The early 
king of Vijayanagara make obeisance to Virupaksha in their inscrip¬ 
tions. It is also on record that Harihara I and Bukka I were the 
disciples of one Kasivilasa Kriyaiakti, a Pasupata teacher. The 
Pasupata, it would seem, was not a bigot. He was well disposed to 
the teachers of Advaita and also to the followers of Vaishnavism. 
Immadi Bukka, son of Harihara, is said to have made a grant to the 
temple of Vidyasankara with the permission of Kriyasakti. Kriya¬ 
sakti himself seems to have made a grant of lands to the local Vishnu 
temple. 

In the course of the fifteenth century a gradual change took place 
in the religious convictions of the Vijayanagara house. The rulers 
developed a partiality for Vaishnavism, and came to be influenced 
more and more by the Vaishnava doctrine. The Saluvas were 
Vaishnavas, devoted to Nrisimha of Ahobalam and Vehkatesa of Tiru- 
pati. But they were not bigoted Vaishnavas; and Siva still had a 
share in their devotion. Narasimha, for instance, though a Vaishnava, 
observed the Sivaratri, and made a grant on that day in A.D. 1466. 

Under the Tuluva rulers, Vaishnavism gained further strength 

and there was an enormous increase in its influence. Krishna- 

• • 

devaraya introduced into Vijayanagara the cult of Vithoba, a phase 
of Vaishnavism that was prevalent in the Maharashtra country. The 
highly artistic nature of the shrine which he caused to be erected for 
the worship of Vithoba is evidence of his intense devotion to Vishnu 
in that form. And yet Krishnadeva, like his predecessors, was an 
eclectic in religion. His eclecticism was of a wider conception 
than that of any monarch on the Vijayanagara throne, and that 
he was warmly devoted to Virupaksha is established by the taste 
he has displayed in putting up his inscription at Virupaksha’s shrine. 
The red-slab record, the only one of its kind put up in this temple, or 
for the matter of that, in this part of the country, is sufficient testi¬ 
mony to this. At the top of this slab are cut the lihga, the bull and 
the universally appearing sun and crescent. That an inscription of 
this king, relating to Virupaksha, should be consigned to a red slab 
which is unique among inscribed slabs, shows that Krishnadeva was 
whole-hearted in his devotion to that God. Among his several acts of 
piety may be mentioned the substantial remission of certain items of 
revenue amounting to 10,000 pon which he made in 1517-18 in favour 


556 


RELIGION 


of the Siva and Vishnu temples in the Cholamandalam, and the 
northern gopuram of the Chidambaram temple which he built in 
1517. Of the poets who adorned Krishnadeva’s court, some were 
great 'Saivas; Timmana, the author of the Pdrijatiapaharanam, a 
Telugu work; Dhurjati, who worte the Rdlahasti-mdhdtmya; and 
Mallana, the author of the Rajasekharacharita. Duarte Barbosa 
gives expression to the spirit of tolerance and religious understand¬ 
ing that prevailed in Vijayangara in the following words: “The King 
allows such freedom that every man may go and live according to 
his own creed without suffering any annoyance, and without enquiry 
whether he is a Christian, Jew, Moor or Heathen. Great equity and 
justice is observed by all.” 

Virasaivism continued to spread in the Kannada country and 
even beyond its borders. Bhima Kavi composed the Basava-Purdna . 
The Prabhullnga-lile was written by Chamarasa, and the Sivataitva- 
chintdmani by Lakkana. Sripati Panditacharya, who is assigned to 
c. A.D. 1400, wrote a commentary, which is called the Srikarabhdsya , 
on the Vedantasutra, from the VIrasaiva standpoint. He calls the 
system which he expounds, Viseshadvaita. Guru-Basava, who 
flourished about A.D. 1430, was a great exponent of Virasaivism; 
seven of his works, which are held in high esteem, are called the 
Sapia-kdvyas. Another eminent VIrasaiva writer, Siddhesvara, lived 
about A.D. 1470. 

Among the Tamil poets who were ardent Saivas, the names of 
two may be mentioned. Arunagiri, author of the Tiruppugazh, 
who was patronised by Devaraya II and Kalamekam who had as 
his patron a provincial governor. 

C. VAISHNAVISM 
• 

1. Ramanuja’s School 

After the death of Vedantadesika in A.D. 1370, 12 his son Varad- 
acharya or Nainar succeeded as pontiff of the Vadakalai sect. But 
his death was followed by a period of disintegration in which there 
was no acknowledged head, till an erudite dclndrya named Adi 
Vana-Sathakopa Svarnl, whose original name was Srlnivasacharya, 
made Ahobila (Kurnul District) the centre of his activities and ralli¬ 
ed a large number of the scattered followers round him. He set up a 
number of local monasteries to popularize the works of Ramanuja 
and Vedantadesika and converted thousands. He declared himself to 
be the servant of Sri LakshmI-Nrisimha and carried his image. He 
gave some privileges to the lower classes in the temples and institu¬ 
ted a class of missionaries for the upliftment of hill tribes. It was pro¬ 
bably due to his influence that king Devaraya II of Vijayanagara was 


557 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


formally initiated into Vaishnavism. Another well known acharya 
was the famous Tolappa (orginal name Venkatanatha), who wrote 
several works on the observances and practices of the Vaishnavas. 
The most important of these, Saddchdra-Sangraha, is a digest of all 
the Smritis, regulating the life of an orthodox Brahmana. 

The rival sect, the Tehkalai, secured dominant position under 
Alagiyamanavala or Varavara Muni, the second in succession from 
Fillai Lokacharya. He returned to iSrirangam and established his 
influence over the orthodox managers of the iSrirangam temple to 
such an extent that the Thirty-Six Thousand or Idu was introduced 
formally as a subject of studies. His teachings and magnetic per¬ 
sonality, as well as organizing ability, made the Tehkalai the domi¬ 
nant sect from Mysore to Cape Comorin, and he came to be regarded 
as avatar a or incarnation of Ramanuja. A large number of impor¬ 
tant temples and monasteries in South India still maintain the popu¬ 
larity of the sect, which was mainly due to the use of the vernacular 
and more liberal social views. 

2. Other Vaishnava Teachers. 

a. Vis hnusvdmin. 

There was a Vaishnava philosopher named Vishnusvamin, who 
is said to have been the son of an amdtya of a Dravida chieftain 
owing allegiance to the Muslim monarch of Delhi. In Nabhaji’s 
Bhakta-mdla, Vishnusvamin is said to have been succeeded on the 
pontifical seat of his school by Jnanadeva (who wrote the Jndnadevi, 
the Marathi commentary on the Gitci), Namadeva, Trilochana, and 
Vallabhacharya. If this tradition is to be accepted, Vishnusvamin 
must have flourished about the second and third quarters of the 
thirteenth century. But some scholars refer him to the beginning 
'of the fifteenth century A.D. This date is more acceptable in view 
of the tradition that Vishnusvamin’s father was an amdtya of a Dra¬ 
vida chieftain owing allegiance to a Muslim ruler of Delhi. For the 
Muslim suzerainty did not extend to South India during the 
thirteenth century A.D. 

b. Vallabhacharya. 

Vallabhacharya, whose Vedantic theory was the same as that 
of Vishnusvamin, was the son of a Tailanga Brahmana named 
Lakshmana Bhatta who lived at Kankarava in the Telugu country. 
Vallabha is said to have been born in A.D. 1479. He lived for some 
time at Vrindavana and for some time at Mathura. Vallabha was 
specially devoted to the manifestation of Krishna caFed Sri-NathajI, 


558 


RELIGION 


and was the founder of the Pushtimdrga, or the path of divine grace. 
This school regards Krishna as the highest Brahman and the highest 
joy (paramananda). His body is said to consist of sat (existence), 
chit (intelligence) and dnanda (joy). Pushti is God’s grace 
(anugraha ) which enables one to attain the objects of life, while 
extraordinary pushti leads to bhakti which again conduces to the 
attainment of God. The sportive Krishna of the cow-settlement, 
with his mistress Radha, is the object of worship to the adherents 
of the Vallabhacharya school. Vallabha’s followers wear twelve 
gopichandana marks on their body to represent the twelve forms 
of Vishnu, such as a perpendicular mark on the forehead, the mark 
of a lotus on the bosom, that of a bamboo leaf on the arms, and 
others. They also print the various weapons of Vishnu on different 
parts of the body. Vallabha is referred to by them as the Achdrya, and 
his son Vitthalesa as the Gosvdmin . The gurus of the Valla¬ 
bhacharya sect, who are called Maharaja, are the descendants of the 
seven sons of Vitthalesa. Each guru has a temple of his own which 
the devotees have to visit for conducting worship. There is no 
common temple of worship for this sect. 

The worship of Radha along with, or in preference to, Krishna 
led to the debasement of Vaishnavism. In the early centuries of the 
Christian era, Krishna was conceived as having amorous dalliances 
with the cowherdesses. Later, Radha, who is not mentioned by 
name in the Harivamsa, Vishnu Purdna, and Bhdgavata Pur ana was 
conceived as his mistress. 13 Reference may be made in this con¬ 
nection to the sect of the Sakhlbhavas who affect to be women and 
dress themselves and act accordingly. Their goal is the realization 
of the position of the female attendants of Radha. 

c. Madhva School. 14 

Jayatirtha was the most important teacher of this school during 
the period under review, and he is usually regarded as the second 
great and outstanding personality of this sect after its founder. He 
was born in a Maratha family at Mangalved, 13 miles south of 
Pandharpur. He spent his life mostly at Malkhed and wrote a 
number of commentaries. It is said that he was invited to Vijaya- 
nagara by Vidyaranya. He must have, therefore, flourished during 
the first half of the fourteenth century A.D. 

The next important name is that of Vidyadhiraja. As the result 
of a split among his disciples, Kavindra and Vagisa migrated to 
Anegundi (Hampi) towards the end of the fourteenth century. 
There were altogether about eleven pontiffs during the fourteenth 
and fifteenth centuries.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


D. MYSTIC SAINTS 
1. Ramananda 

There are conflicting traditions about the time when Rama¬ 
nanda flourished. Bhandarkar suggested that he was born in A.D. 
1299-1300, and died in A.D. 1411. But if the tradition that his dis¬ 
ciple Kabir lived at the time of Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1489-1517) is 
genuine, even these dates must be regarded as doubtful. It seems 
better to refer Ramananda’s birth to the fourteenth, and his death 
to the fifteenth, century. He is said to have been born at Prayaga 
or Allahabad and to have studied the Visishtadvaita system of Rama¬ 
nuja at Varanasi at the feet of a teacher named Raghavananda. 
After some time he gave up some practices followed by orthodox 
Vaishnavas (e.g. taking food without being seen by anybody), and 
founded a new school of Vaishnavism based on the gospel of love 
and devotion. The most important reform attributed to him is the 
abolition of considerations of caste among his followers. He made 
no distinction between a Brahmana and a member of the lowest 
castes. He was himself a Brahmana, but had no objection to dine 
with members of the low castes if they were Vaishnavas. He took 
pupils even from the so-called degraded castes. According to 
tradition, his first twelve disciples were Asananda, Surasurananda, 
Sukhananda, Paramananda, Mahananda, Plpa (a Rajput ruling chief), 
Kabir (weaver), Bhavananda, Sena (barber), Dhanna (Jath peasant), 
Sri Ananda, and Ravidas (cobbler). Although a spirit of sympathy 
for the low castes was a feature of Vaishnavism, the earlier Vaishna¬ 
vas did not put sufficient emphasis on this point. Ramananda, how¬ 
ever, made it a fundamental tenet of his doctrine. The use of the 
vernacular instead of Sanskrit was another reform introduced by 
Ramananda. The third important reform attributed to Ramananda 
is the introduction, on a firm basis, of the cult of Rama and Slta in 
place of the worship of Krishna and Radha. Ramananda borrowed 
ideas from the various religious schools that flourished before him, 
but vitalized them with the love and devotion of his heart, and 
founded a new path of spiritual realization. It is this path which 
Kabir and others followed later and decorated with their lives and 
sayings. Ramananda may be said to have begun what is known as 
the religious renaissance in Medieval India. 15 

Ramananda occupies a unique place in the history of religion in 
Medieval India. Although brought up in the traditional school of 
Vaishnavism founded by Ramanuja, he gave an altogether new turn 
to it by his reforms, and was mainly instrumental in ushering in 
the new epoch of medieval mysticism to which reference has been 


560 


RELIGION 


made above. He has not left behind any written records of his 
new message, but his disciples and their successors embodied in their 
lives and teachings the new way of spiritual realization revealed by 
him. One of his songs, preserved in the Sikh scripture Granth 
Sahib , may be taken as the gist of his teachings. “I had an incli¬ 
nation to go with sandal and other perfumes to offer my worship to 
Brahman. But the guru revealed that Brahman was in my own 
heart. Wherever I go, I see only water and stones (worshipped); 
but it is Thou who hast filled them all with Thy presence. They all 
seek Thee in vain among the Vedas. My own true guru, Thou hast 
put an end to all my failures and illusions. Blessed art Thou! 
Ramananda is lost in his Master, Brahman, it is the word of the guru 
that destroys all the million bonds of action”. 16 

2. Kablr 

The most famous disciple of Ramananda was Kablr. His early 
life is shrouded in mystery. All that is definitely known is that 
he was brought up by a Muslim weaver named Niru. According to 
legends of uncertain date, he was the illegitimate son of a Brahmana 
widow. She cast off the infant to escape infamy, and the weaver’s 
wife found him and adopted him as her son. According to other 
legends, Kablr was really the son of the Muslim weaver. Wilson 
thought it improbable, if not impossible, that Kablr was a Muslim. 
Malcolm and Westcott are inclined to regard him as a Muslim by 
birth. 17 

The date of Kabir’s birth is not definitely known. According to 
legends, Sikandar Lodi, the bigoted Sultan, tried by various means 
to kill Kablr, but the latter was miraculously saved each time. 
Both Hindu and Muslim legends make Kablr a contemporary of 
Shaikh Taqqi; the former represent them as rivals, while the latter 
regard Taqqi as the Pir or religious guide of Kablr. Taqqi is said 
to have been the Pir of Sikandar Lodi also. So we may take Kablr 
as a contemporary of Sikandar Lodi, who ruled from A.D. 1489 to 
1517. This fits in with the tradition that Kablr died in A.D. 1518, 
and that Nanak met him about A.D. 1496, but not with the other 
tradition which places his birth in A.D. 1398. 18 

The way in which he became a disciple of Ramananda is des¬ 
cribed in the legends. It is said that Kablr lay down on the steps of 
the bathing ghat where Ramananda used to take his bath early 
morning every day. Ramananda, having stepped on him by 
accident, exclaimed Ram, Ram. Kablr took that as the mantra , and 
Ramananda, apprised of the whole fact, accepted him as his disciple. 
After that Kablr returned home and led a pious and saintly life. 

561 


D.S.—3 6 


THE DEIJ3I SULTANATE 


But he did not favour asceticism or mortification of flesh which he 
considered as useless. “If”, said he, “salvation is achieved by 
living on roots and fruits alone, birds’ and animals’ would be ideal 
lives.” He married and had two children, a son and a daughter. 
He led the life of a simple householder and earned his livelihood 
by his father’s profession of weaving. He himself wove cloth and 
took it to the market, even when he had numerous disciples and 
were held by them in the highest veneration. His usual place of 
residence was at Varanasi (Banaras). 

Of Kabir’s learning and scholarship we know very little. But 
he was conversant with the religious literature of the Hindus. The 
following short account is preserved in the Bhakta-mala of NabhajI 
which is generally regarded as an authentic source. 

“Kablr refused to acknowledge caste distinctions or to recog¬ 
nise the authority of the six schools of Hindu Philosophy, nor did he 
set any store by the four divisions of life (Ashram) prescribed for 
Brahmins. He held that religion without bhakti was no religion at 
all and that asceticism, fasting and alms-giving had no value if un¬ 
accompanied by worship (Bhajan, hymn-singing). By means of 
Ramainis, Shabdas and Sakhis he imparted religious instruction to 
Hindus and Muhammadans alike. He had no preference for either 
religion, but gave teaching that was appreciated by the followers of 
both. He spoke out his mind fearlessly and never made it his object 
merely to please his hearers.” 19 

Kablr made no distinction between Hinduism and Islam. 
“Kablr is the child of Allah and Ram”, he used to say, and made an 
earnest, though unsuccessful, effort to remove the differences which 
separated Hindus and Muslims. The Hindu and Muslim followers 
of Kablr are naturally prone to represent him as having derived his 
moral and spiritual truth more from the one or the other source. 
A western scholar, who has gone deeply into the study of this sub¬ 
ject, makes the following observations: “His favourite name for 
God is Rama. Like all his Vaishnavite predecessors he seeks re¬ 
lease from transmigration and opens the path to deliverance by lov¬ 
ing devotion. The ancient mythology provides him with frequent 
illustrations; the great gods of the venerable Triad, Brahma, Vishnu, 
Siva still perform their functions in the economy of existence. And 
Kablr has not studied philosophy for nothing; its language is often 
on his lips”. 20 

Kablr, however, was insistent on bringing home to the minds of 
his disciples that the difference between Hindus and Muslims is 
merely an artificial one. “In the beginning”, said he, “there was 
not Turk nor Hindu,—no race, no caste.” 


562 


RELIGION 


There is no doubt that Kablr had a large following both among 
Hindus and Muslims. It is said that when he died at Maghar in the 
district of Gorakhpur, there was a dispute among the Hindus and 
Muslim Kablr-panthis (followers of Kablr) as to the disposal of his 
body. The Hindus wanted to burn, and the Muslims to bury it. But 
when the sheet covering the dead body was removed, nothing was 
found but a heap of flov/ers. The Hindus took half of these and 
burnt them at Varanasi. The other half was buried by the Mus¬ 
lims at Maghar. 

Kablr did not codify his doctrine in the form of a book. He was 
fond of oral teachings in the shape of small poems. These are 
collected in the Bijaka (the Seed Book), the sacred text of the 
Kabir-panthis who all recognize it to be an authoritative expo¬ 
sition of their master’s teachings. It contains poems and songs in a 
great variety of metres. A current edition of this text contains 83 
Ramamis, 113 Shabdas, 33 poems of various kinds, and 384 Sdkhis. 
To these have been added 60 Sdkhis found in other editions. 21 The 
most important of these are Sdkhis (corruption of Sanskrit sdkshi t 
meaning evidence) or rhyming couplets bearing witness to the 
truth. 22 The fine rhythm of these enables one to easily remember 
them. The language of the Bijaka is said to be Hindi, then in vogue 
in the neighbourhood of Varanasi (Banaras), Mirzapur and Gorakh¬ 
pur. But it contains more than 235 words of Persian, Arabic and 
Turkish origins. 23 Reference has been made above to the Bdnls or 
“Message Poems” of Kablr. 

According to tradition, the Bijaka was dictated by Kabir himself 
to a disciple named Bhagawan Das. But some modern scholars hold 
that the oral teaching of Kabir was not reduced to writing till A.D. 
1570, that is, about half a century after Kabir’s death. The Bijaka is 
the first collection, and belongs to this period. It may be added, as an 
evidence of the authenticity of this work, that most of the sayings 
attributed to Kablr in the Adi-Grantha of the Sikhs, are also found 
in the Bijaka. 24 

The message of Kabir and the spirit of his teachings can be 
easily gathered from his poems which go straight to the heart of 
man and are even today well-known over a large part of Northern 
India. Some of these have been quoted in the Appendix, and a few 
passages are given below in order to give an idea of the views held 
by this great preacher. 

1. Sanskrit is the water in a well, the language of the people 
is the flowing stream. 

2. If by worshipping stones one can find God, I shall worship 
a mountain. 


563 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


3. If by immersion in the water salvation be obtained, the 
frogs bathe continually. As the frogs, so are these men, again and 
again they fall into the womb. 

4. If by wandering about naked, union with Hari be obtained, 
then every deer of the forest will become emancipated. If by shav¬ 
ing the head, perfection is obtained, the sheep is emancipated. 

5. O QazI, what book is expounded by thee; all such as are 
pondering on the book are killed; give up the book, adore Ram. 

6. A man may read many books before he dies and yet not be 
a Pandit; he is a Pandit who understands the two and a half letters 
which form the word ‘Love’. 

7. Be truthful, be natural; Truth alone is natural. Seek this 
truth within your own heart, for there is no truth in the external 
religious observances; neither in the sects nor in the holy vows, 
neither in religious garb nor in pilgrimages. Truth resides within 
the heart and is revealed in love, in strength, in compassion. Conquer 
hatred, and extend your love to all mankind, for God resides in all. 

8. The difference among faiths is only due to difference in 
names; everywhere there is yearning for the same God. Why do 
the Hindus and Muslims quarrel for nothing? Keep at a distance all 
pride and vanity, insincerity and falsehood; consider others the same 
as yourself, let your heart be filled with love and devotion. Then 
alone will your struggle be successful. Life is transitory, do not 
waste your time, but take refuge in God. He is within your own 
heart; so why do you fruitlessly search Him in holy places, in scrip¬ 
tures, in rites and ceremonials? 

9. Brother! From where have the two masters of the Universe 
come? Tell me, who has invented the names of Allah, Ram, Kesav, 
Hari and Hazrat? All ornaments of gold are made of a unique sub¬ 
stance. It is to show to the world that two different signs are made, 
one is called Nimdz while the other is termed Pujd. Mahadev and 
Muhammad are one and the same: Brahma and Adam are one and 
the same. What is a Hindu? What is a Turk? Both inhabit the 
same earth. One reads the Veda, and the other the Qur'an and the 
Khutba. One is a Maulana and the other a Pandit. Earthen vessels 
have different names, although they are made from the same earth. 
Kabir says: both are misled, none has found God. 

10. Ram, Khuda, &akti, !§iva are one. Then to whom do the 
prayers go? The Vedas, the Pur anas and the Qur'an are only diffe¬ 
rent manners of description. Neither the Hindu nor the Turk, 
neither the Jain nor the Yogi is cognizant of the secret. 


564 


RELIGION 


11. Allah and Ram are thy names. Thou art master full of 
mlsericorde. It is no use bending the shaven head to the ground; 
it is no use washing your bodies with water. The Hindu observes 
twenty-four fasts of EkadasI, while the Muslim observes his full 
month fast. If only one month is sacred, what about the other 
eleven months? 

12. Saints, see how the world has gone mad. If I fell them 
the truth they run after me to beat me. The world believes in false¬ 
hood. I have seen those who observed punctiliously all the religious 
practices and ceremonies. I have seen those too who take a bath 
every morning. They worship idols of copper and stone. They 
have become mad by the pride of their pilgrimages. The Hindu says 
that he worships Ram and the Muslim says that he worships Rahman. 
They die of disputing with one another. Both are ignorant of the 
secret. Kabir says: O Saints, listen! All this is due to error and 
ignorance! 25 

After the death of Kabir his disciples approached his son Kamal 
with a request to found a sect. Kamal, as a worthy son of his father, 
replied: “My father had striven throughout his life against all 
forms of sectarianism; how can I, his son, destroy his ideal and there¬ 
by commit his spiritual murder ? 25a This disappointed the disciples 
of Kabir, but could not prevent the rise of Kabir-panthi sects. Kabir’s 
Muslim disciples founded a monastery at Maghar, while his Hindu 
disciples likewise organized themselves into an order under the 
leadership of Surat Gopal. Many of his other disciples also founded 
separate sects. The seed of the message of the unity of Hari and 
Allah was not evidently sown on a fertile soil and did not sprout. 
Nevertheless the spirit of Kabir’s teachings did not die out, and 
was kept alive by his numerous disciples and followers. Their acti¬ 
vities, however, fall beyond the period under review, and will be 
treated in the next volume. 

3. Other disciples and follovjers of Ramananda. 

It is doubtful whether all the twelve disciples mentioned above 
were really initiated by Ramananda. Some of these were probably 
attracted by his ideas and teachings, but joined his order after his 
death. That was the case with Anantananda who founded a sect. 
His grand-disciple, Nabhia, an untouchable, was the author of the 
Bhakta-mdla or 'Lives of Devotees’ which is one of the most important 
source-books for the history of the medieval saints. 

Another famous follower of Ramananda, though not an actual 
disciple, was Sadna, a butcher by caste, two of whose songs are in¬ 
cluded in the Grantha Sahib. 


565 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Among the twelve disciples mentioned above, Ravidas occupies 
a high place on account of his exalted spiritual life and purity of 
heart. He is reputed to have been the spiritual guru of Jhall and 
Mlrabai, two queens of the &isodiya Rana family of Chitor. His reli¬ 
gious ideas followed the same lines as those of Kablr. 

We need not dwell at length on the other disciples of Rama- 
nanda, each of whom gathered round him a devoted band of fol¬ 
lowers. The monasteries founded by some of them still attract 
devoted pilgrims. 


4. Chahanya. 

Though differing in some respects from the views of Rama- 
nanda and Kablr, Chaitanya (an abbreviated form of the full name 
Krishna-Chaitanya) must be regarded as one of the greatest saints 
in Medieval India. His original name was Visvambhara (nickname, 
Nirnai), and he was born in February, 1486, in a family which had 
migrated from Sylhet (E. Pakistan) and settled in Navadvlpa or 
Nadiya in West Bengal. He studied in a Sanskrit tol and, after the 
death of his father, himself set up a tol • He married twice, as his 
first wife died shortly after her marriage. At the age of twenty- 
two Visvambhara visited Gaya to offer oblations to his deceased 
father. There he met a recluse named isvarapuri, who gave him 
Krishna-mantra. This changed the whole tenor of his life. He be¬ 
came veritably a god-intoxicated devotee. Wrapped in mystic and 
emotional experience, he incessantly uttered the name of Krishna, 
laughed, wept and raved, and not unoften fell into trances. A band 
of followers gathered round him, including two great devotees named 
Advaita and Nityananda, and with their co-operation he introduced 
some striking innovations in religious life. A new type of emo¬ 
tional and devotional songs, called kirtana , often consisting of merely 
recitation of the names of Hari and Krishna, and sung in chorus to the 
accompaniment of loud instrumental music, became the regular fea¬ 
ture of religious life. Huge processions of kirtana parties paraded 
the streets of Navadvlpa, with Visvambhara and his prominent 
followers at the head, singing and dancing wildly in a mood of 
ecstasy. Devotional meetings, the main feature of which was kirtana, 
were held almost daily in the house of pious Srinivasa, where strange 
scenes were witnessed of hysterical orgy of dancing and wild fits 
of ecstatic thrills. Men trembled, wept, and raved, while dancing, 
for hours together; this covered their body with copious perspira¬ 
tion, and in some cases brought on exhaustion ending in fits of un¬ 
consciousness or mystic trances. But whatever we may think of 
it, such emotional mode of worship, merely consisting in musical 


566 


RELIGION 


recitation of the names of Hari and Krishna, made this new cult of 
Vaishnavism highly popular among the masses. A section of the 
public got disgusted with the tumultuous scenes in public streets, 
and the Muslim governor prohibited the klrtana party. But Vis- 
vambhara adopted, what is called in our day, methods of civil dis¬ 
obedience or passive resistance. He openly defied the order till it 
was rescinded (by divine interference in the shape of a dream, as 
the scriptures would have us believe). 

Visvambhara was initiated as a sannyasin (ascetic) by Kesava 
Bharati in January, 1510, and adopted the name Sri Krishna-Chai- 
tanya, abbreviated into Chaitanya. His first idea was to settle at 
Vrindavana, the reputed scene of Krishna’s boyhood, as described 
in the Bhdgavata Purdna. But at his mother’s request he agreed to 
fix his permanent residence nearer home, at Puri. Here both Partapa- 
rudra, the Gajapati king of Orissa, and Vasudeva Sarvabhauma, a re¬ 
nowned Vedantist, are said to have become his followers, and the 
new cult obtained a firm footing. Later, Chaitanya made an exten¬ 
sive pilgrimage to South and West India (c. 1509-11), preaching his 
gospel all along his way. Shortly after his return he made a similar 
tour in North India, proceeding as a far as Vrindavana. The sacred 
sites of Vrindavana were deserted and forgotten. Their recovery 
by the Bengal Vaishnavas, at the instance of Chaitanya, and the 
conversion of the holy site into a great religious centre, must be 
regarded as one of the most important events in the history of 
Vaishnavism. The task was mainly accomplished by two highly 
placed Hindu officials of the Muslim ruler of Bengal, who met 
Chaitanya at Gauda on his way to Vrindavana and became his de¬ 
voted followers. They became celebrated under their new names 
Rupa and Sanatana, and settled at Vrindavana. From A.D. 1515 
till his death in 1533, Chaitanya remained at Puri. He spent his 
time in expounding his teachings, amidst frequent religious trances 
and divine ecstasies. During the last twelve years he was seized 
with an extraordinary degree of devotional fervour and passed in 
a state of continual frenzy, which is described in Vaishnava lite¬ 
rature as a state of divyonmdda or premonmada (madness of divine 
love). 26 

Like other medieval saints, Chaitanya laid stress on sincere and 
passionate love for God as the only way to salvation, but he was 
thoroughly saturated with the Radha-Krishna cult, and stressed the 
amorous episodes described in the Bhdgavata . There is no doubt 
that he was profoundly influenced by the passionate romantic poems 
of Jayadeva, and the melodious songs of Chandidasa, both based on 
the theme of the love of Radha and Krishna. According to Chaitanya 


567 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


School, Krishna took his birth as a human being (Chaitanya) in 
order to enjoy, through personal experience, the ardour of Radha’s 
passions for her beloved Krishna. As a matter of fact, probably no 
other religious saint carried to such an extent the emotional ap¬ 
proach to God as a lover to his beloved. But this love had nothing 
physical in it and Chaitanya put it on a high spiritual plane. Hence 
he took good care to guard against its degeneration into sensual 
amours. Any kind of social intercourse with women was forbidden 
to his followers, and Chaitanya refused to see the face of one of his 
most favourite disciples for no greater offence than having exchang¬ 
ed a few formal words with an elderly Vaishnava lady whose piety 
and virtue were well known to him. He did not lay great stress 
on knowledge, though a profound philosophy grew round his teach¬ 
ings in course of time. He laid down, by his precept and example, 
sincere zeal and devotion, and a passionate love for Hari or Krishna, 
as the only means of salvation; and elevated the simple recitation 
of the names of Hari and Krishna to the level of a high spiritual 
discipline as a sacred mantra. He emphasized universal love and 
brotherhood as the first step to the love of God. He was a mystic 
par excellence , and may even be said to have carried his mysticism 
beyond all rational limits; yet, though he did not care for rituals, 
he did not discard the sacred scriptures, or worship of images of 
gods, as utterly useless. In his attitude towards caste, also, he seems 
to have followed a middle path. He disregarded all distinctions 
of caste and creed so far as reilgious initiation was concerned, and 
one of his most favourite disciples was a Muslim devotee named 
Haridasa. But he is said to have approved of the latter’s conduct in 
not entering the temple of Jagannatha or taking his meals with the 
Hindu devotees. There are, however, incidents, in his authentic 
biography, which are not fully in consonance with this conservative 
attitude. There is, however, no doubt that his catholic spirit made 
no distinctions between the Brahmanas, Chandalas, and Yavanas 
(Muslims), and brought them all within the fold of his religion of 
love and charity. This liberal outlook, which formed an essential 
feature of Chaitanya’s sect, at least to begin with, was one of the 
most important reasons for its wide popularity among the masses. 

Chaitanya did not leave behind any regular organization to carry 
on his work, but as in the case of Kabir and others, several sects 
grew in course of time. The main sect, which flourished in Bengal, 
rapidly became very popular and exists even today. 

The descendants of Nityananda living at Navadvipa, and those 
of Advaita residing at Santipur, are the spiritual heads of the sect. 
There are several temples of this sect in Bengal and at Mathura

and Vrindavana. The followers of Chaitanya wear two white per¬ 
pendicular lines on the forehead, joined together at the bridge of 
the nose, together with a line continued up to the tip of the nose. 
They also wear a necklace of three strings of Tulasl beads and a 
rosary of the same. 


5. Ntinak 

Nanak, an elderly contemporary of Chaitanya, holds a unique 
place among the medieval saints of India. He cut himself adrift 
from all associations with prevailing sectarian religions, and al¬ 
though his approach to God was through love and devotion, he did 
not adopt the imagery or symbolism of Vaishnavism or any other 
creed. His was the first, and also the last, successful attempt to 
bring together the Hindus and Muslims in a common fold of spiri¬ 
tual and social brotherhood. The fact that it was not destined to 
spread beyond the confines of a narrow geographical region, merely 
demonstrates the almost insuperable difficulty involved in the task 
that he had undertaken, and the high place that must be given to 
him in the socio-religious history of India even for his partial suc¬ 
cess. The political achievements of Sikhism, the great sect which 
owes its origin to him, have largely over-shadowed its spiritual 
character, but it is this latter aspect alone with which the name of 
Nanak must ever be associated, and which therefore should engage 
our sole attention. 

Nanak was born in A.D. 1469 in a Khatri family, at Talwandi, 
now known as Nankana, situated about thirty-five miles to the 
south-west of Lahore. His father, Kalu, was an accountant in the 
village, and Nanak received his first education in the local school. 
But he was indifferent to study and preferred the retirement of the 
forest and the society of the religious men who frequented it. Kalu 
did not like the religious temperament of his son, and made Nanak 
study the Persian language so that he might be fit for the post 
which he (Kalu) then held. But though Nanak became highly profi¬ 
cient in Persian, his religious and spiritual tendencies grew more 
and more with his age. He also showed a marked disinclination 
to abide by religious customs and conventions such as putting on 
the sacred thread. Nanak married at an early age but could not 
be induced to do any useful work to earn his livelihood. It is said 
that he spent his time in carrying on discourses with the sadhus 
or saints, and composing religious hymns in praise of the one God 
whom he loved. Through these hymns he preached high ethical 
and spiritual doctrines by means of simple allegorical representa¬ 
tions. Thus when Nanak was asked by his father to turn his atten¬ 
tion to agriculture, he replied: “Make thy body the fields, good 


569 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


works the seed, irrigate with God’s name; make thy heart the culti¬ 
vator, God will germinate in thy heart, and thou shalt thus obtain 
the dignity of nirvdn”. When his father asked him to keep a shop, 
Nanak replied in a similar strain: “Make the knowledge that life is 
frail thy shop, the true Name thy stock-in-trade”. Once his father 
sent him with a sum of money to buy some articles of trade, but 
he gave the whole amount to some mendicants whom he met on 
the way. Jairam, who had married Nanak’s sister and held the 
post of a revenue officer at Sultanpur, took him there and secured 
the post of store-keeper for him. He did the work quite well for 
some time. But suddenly one day he disappeared in the neighbour¬ 
hood and is said to have the vision of God in a trance and heard a 
divine voice: “My name is God, and thou art the divine guru”. 

On his return from the forest after three days, he gave to the 
poor all that he possessed and left the world. He put on a mendicant’s 
garb and sought the company of religious men. He then announced 
that there was no Hindu and no Musulman. When questioned by 
the Muslim qazi, he replied: “Make kindness thy mosque, sincerity 
thy prayer carpet, what is just and lawful thy Qur‘an, modesty thy 
curcumcision, civility thy fasting, so shalt thou be a Musulman”. 
In this strain Nanak laid emphasis on the purity of character and 
conduct and a high ethical code, rather than any dogma or creed of 
any sect, as the sole means of salvation. He believed in one God, 
and love and constant meditation upon Him as the only way of re¬ 
ceiving His grace. He denounced the worship of images and all 
distinctions of caste and creed. He preached his catholic views 
through the hymns which he sang to the accompaniment of the 
rebek (a stringed musical instrument) played by Mardana, who be¬ 
longed to the tribe of hereditary minstrels called Dums, and came 
from Talwandi to become a servant of Nanak at Sultanpur. Accom¬ 
panied by his faithful attendant Mardana, Nanak is said to have 
undertaken wide tours all over India, and even beyond it to Ceylon 
in the south, and Mecca and Medina on the west. A number of 
miracles are attributed to him throughout his travels. He made 
quite a large number of converts during this journey and his name 
and fame spread on all sides. 

Nanak died in A.D. 1538 at Kartarpur in the Punjab. His Hindu 
and Muslim disciples wanted to dispose of the body according to 
their respective customs. But, as in the case of Kabir, when the 
covering sheet was removed next morning, the body had disappear¬ 
ed and there remained only two bunches of flowers deposited on his 
two sides by the respective groups. The Hindus erected a shrine, 
and the Muslims, a tomb, on the bank of the Ravi. 


570 


RELIGION 


Nanak had two sons, but their minds were insincere and they 
had rebelled and deserted him. So shortly before his death, he 
appointed Ahgad his successor. 

The hymns of Nanak have been preserved in the Adi-Grantha. 
In these he sang the glory of one great God, and man’s duty of 
meditating His name with a pure heart, bereft of all evil passions 
and desires for worldly good. One of his hymns contains the fol¬ 
lowing: “At God’s gate there dwell thousands of Muhammads, 
thousands of Brahmas, of Vishnus, of Sivas; thousands upon 
thousands of exalted Ramas. There is one Lord over all spiritual 
lords, the creator whose name is true”. 27 Nanak preached that reli¬ 
gious acts and austerities practised by the different religious sects 
were useless, and love and devotion to the one God is the only way 
of attaining His grace and blessings. “The real temple was the 
house in which the Lord’s praises were ever sung and the Lord’s 
name continually repeated”. Setting aside the Vedas and the 
Qur'an, he taught his followers to repeat the name of the infinite 
God who surpasses all conceptions. He stressed the role of guru 
whose guidance was of the utmost value in the development of spiri¬ 
tual life. 28 Nanak acknowledged Kabir as his spiritual guide 29 , and 
the following hymns, 30 like many others, closely echo the teachings 
of that great saint: 

I. Religion consisteth not in a patched coat, or in a Yogi’s staff, 
or in ashes smeared over the body; 

Religion consisteth not in earrings worn, or a shaven head, 
or in the blowing of horns. 

Abide pure amid the impurities of the world; thus shalt thou 
find the way of religion. 

II. Religion consisteth not in mere words; 

He who looketh on all men as equal is religious. 

Religion consisteth not in wandering to tombs or places of 
cremation, or sitting in attitudes of contemplation; 

Religion consisteth not in earrings worn, or a shaven head, 
or bathing at places of pilgrimages. 

Abide pure amid the impurities of the world; thus shalt thou 
find the way of religion. 

III. On meeting a true guru doubt is dispelled and the wanderings 
of the mind restrained. 

It raineth nectar, slow ecstatic music is heard, and man is 
happy within himself. 

Abide pure amid the impurities of the world; thus shalt thou 
find the way of religion.

O servant, where dost thou seek me, 

Lo, I am beside thee. 

I am neither in temple nor in mosque: 

I am neither in Kaaba nor in Kailash: 

Neither am I in rites and ceremonies, nor in yoga and renunciation. 

If thou art a true seeker, thou shalt at once see Me: thou shall 
meet Me in a moment of time. 

Kabir says, “O Sadhu! God is the breath of all breath”

1. 20. man na rangaye 

The Yogi dyes his garments, instead of dyeing his mind in the 
colours of love: 

He sits within the temple of the Lord, leaving Brahma, to worship 
a stone. 

He pierces holes in his ears, he has a great beard and matted locks, 
he looks like a goat: 

He goes forth into the wilderness, killing all his desires, and turns 
himself into a eunuch: 

He shaves his head and dyes his garments; he reads the Gita and 
becomes a mighty talker. 

Kabir says: “You are going to the doors of death, bound hand and 
foot!”

III. 2. jo khoda masjid vasat hai 

If God be within the mosque, then to whom does this world belong? 

If Ram be within the image which you find upon your pilgrimage, 
then who is there to know what happens without? 

Hari is in the East: Allah is in the West. Look within your heart, 
for there you will find both Karim and Ram; 

All the men and women of the world are His living forms. 

Kabir is the child of Allah and of Ram: He is my Guru, He is 
my Pir.

CHAPTER XVII 


SOCIAL LIFE 

A. HINDU SOCIETY 
1. Introductory 

The conquest of the major parts of North India by the Muslim 
Turks is the dominant historical event of the thirteenth century A.D., 
but its full effects were felt for the first time during the period under 
review. The conquest was attended by extensive settlements of the 
foreigners whose number was being increased by constant migra¬ 
tions from the Islamic lands as well as by occasional mass conver¬ 
sions of the indigenous people. Because of the inflexibility of their 
religious creed, which permitted no compromise with other faiths, 
the settlers remained (as their co-religionists still remain) a dis¬ 
tinct social unit, thus introducing a permanent cleavage of the 
Indian population along religious lines. The impact of militant 
Islam had as yet but little effect upon the age-old social life of the 
older inhabitants. Even the teachings of the saints and mystics 
of the fourteenth and later centuries, which formed one of the most 
characteristic developments of the time, left the Hindu society as 
yet practically unchanged. Indirectly, however, the new menace 
to the existence of the indigenous culture led to the production of 
a large number of Smriti Digests and Commentaries tending towards 
systematization of the old social and religious law. The somewhat 
different pattern of the social structure, envisaged in the historical 
records of the indigenous people of different regions of the time, 
bear the impress of this teaching. 1 

In so far as the social life of the vast majority of the Indian 
population following the indigenous faiths is concerned, the Smriti 
authorities therefore constitute, for the centuries of our survey, our 
basic authority. What distinguishes this period from the preced¬ 
ing one is the paucity of inscriptions such as those which helped 
previously to check the Smriti evidence in the precise context of its 
application to specific regions and dates. This defect is somewhat 
compensated by the rise of regional schools of Smritis with their 
respective authoritative Digests. Such, in the first place, is the 
school of Mithila of which the principal authorities for our period 
are the Grihastharatndkara and other works of Chandesvara (1300- 
70), the Vivadachintdmani and other works of Vachaspati Misra 


574 


HINDU SOCIETY 


(1425-90), and the Vivddachandra of Misarumisra (flor. c. 1450). 
Such, again, is the school of Banaras of which the Madana-ratna- 
pradipa, attributed to a chieftain in Gorakhpur area called Madana- 
sirhha and consisting of VyavaMravivekoddyota and other sections 
(composed between A.D. 1425 and 1450), and the Madanapdriydta of 
Visvesvarabhatta (composed between A.D. 1360 and 1390) are our 
authorities. Such is also the school of Bengal with the celebrated 
commentary, Dtpakalikd, on Ydjnavalkya-Smriti and other works 
of Sulapani (1375-1440) as our authority. Such, finally, is the 
Southern school having as its principal authorities, Pardsara-Smriti, 
with the gloss of the celebrated Madhavacharya (hereafter referred 
to as Pardsara-Mddhava ) and other works of the same Madhava¬ 
charya, otherwise called Vidyaranya (1300-1380), the Nrisimha - 
prasada consisting of the Vyavahdrasdra and other sections (com¬ 
posed between A.D. 1490 and 1515) of Daiapati, and the Sarasvati - 
vildsa (comprising Vyavahdrakdnda and other sections) of Pratapa- 
rudra (1497-c. 1540). 2 More indefinite in their application are the 
Smriti sections belonging to the late Purdnas like the Brihaddharma 
Pur ana. The picture which emerges from our survey of this vast 
and scattered material is that of conformity to the general pattern 
of the old Sinritis with some important developments which will 
principally form the subject-matter of this chapter. 

2. Social divisions and sub-divisions 

The social structure in the Smritis consists, as is well known, 
of four primary castes (the Brahmanas, the Kshatriyas, the Vaisyas 
and the Sudras) with diminishing rank and status, an indefinite 
number of the so-called mixed castes of varying status, and finally, 
of a group of despised castes coming at the bottom of the scale. The 
duties and occupations of these castes (specially of the Brahmanas 
and the Kshatriyas) are described at great length in these works. 
The Smritis likewise describe, under the head dhnika, the daily 
routine of the householder ( grihastha ) and the would-be householder 
(snataka ) belonging to the three upper classes. The picture is that 
of incessant toil devoted to religious practices and acts of piety. As 
a Smriti authority (Daksha quoted in the Grihastfiaratndkara , 134) 
observes: “From sunrise to sunset the Brahmana should not remain 
idle for an instant, and he should devote himself to his compulsory, 
occasional and optional duties, as well as other blameless occupa¬ 
tions.” 

The above rules are repeated in the Smriti commentaries and 
Digests of our period with occasional comments which will be 
briefly noticed here. As regards the Brahmana’s occupations the 
Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 425-26) first declares agriculture and so forth 


575 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to be of the nature of duties prescribed in the scriptures, on the 
ground that officiating at sacrifices and the like are of too rare an 
occurrence to furnish means of subsistence for householders in the 
Kali Age. Quoting in the next place a number of mutually con¬ 
tradictory texts about the lawfulness of the Brahmana’s occupation 
of agriculture, the author adjusts the difference in two alternative 
ways; they refer, we are told, to different degrees of distress (the 
Brahmana being held to be entitled to pursue agriculture through 
others in a time of slight distress, and in person at a time of grave 
distress), or else to different yugas or Age-cycles (the Brahmana’s 
pursuit of agriculture through others being declared to be his duty 
in times of distress in the other Ages and his principal duty in the 
Kali Age). The professions of trade and crafts, like that of agricul¬ 
ture, we are told elsewhere by the same authority (I, 435), belong to 
all castes, and the Brahmanas in particular are entitled to practise 
agriculture. In view of this clear and authoritative exposition of 
the normal occupations of Brahmanas, the ban on the modes of sub¬ 
sistence previously conceded to them in times of distress, which 
occurs in a list of forbidden practices of the Kali Age ( Kalivarjyas ) 
quoted with approval by the author in another context (I, 123-27), 
seems to be somewhat unreal. On the other hand, the prohibition 
in the same list of Kalivarjyas of the Brahmana’s living by non-accu¬ 
mulation of grain for the next day—a practice which is extolled in 
some of the Smritis as the most praiseworthy for a Brahmana— 
appears to be thoroughly in accord with the spirit of the age. The 
high eulogy of Brahmanas is accompanied in our present works, as 
in the Smritis , with strong denunciation of unworthy members of 
this order ( Pamsara-Mddhava, III, 158 ff.; Brihaddharma Purdna , 
III, 2. ff). 

As for the duties of the next two castes in the order of social 
precedence, it will be sufficient for our purpose to quote the obser¬ 
vations in the Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 390-97). Describing the duties 
of the king, after the Smriti standards, under the heads, ‘punishing 
the wicked’ and ‘cherishing the good’, the author takes great pains 
to justify the orthodox position that these constitute the distinctive 
duty of the Kshatriya. The title of king, it is argued after quoted 
texts, appertains to the Kshatriya, and the right to wield weapons 
for the purpose of protecting the people likewise belongs to him 
alone. 

In so far as the Smriti routine of the daily duties of the house¬ 
holder is concerned, a few comments of our authors call for notice. 
One who has studied the whole Veda, we are told in the Grihastha - 
raindkara (249), should repeat the same from the beginning, one who 


576 


HINDU SOCIETY 


has studied only a portion of the Vedas is to repeat the Purusha- 
sukta ( Rv X, 90) and similar texts, while one who has studied only 
the Gdyatri hymn is to repeat the Purdnas. The Pardsara-Mddhava 
(I, 292-93) similarly explains that one who is capable of performance 
of the Vedic rites should not be content with the rites prescribed 
in the Smritis, but one incapable of performance of the Vedic rites 
should perform those of the Smritis, and one unable to perform even 
the latter should follow good custom. These extracts, while illu¬ 
strating the characteristic tendency of the Smritis to adjust their 
rules to the varying capacities and inclinations of the people at 
different periods, are a reminder of the decline of Vedic learning 
and rites among the upper classes at this period. Of equal import¬ 
ance is the explanation in the Pardsara-Mddhava of the householder’s 
daily obligation of hospitable reception of guests. The praise of 
feeding friends along with condemnation of feeding enemies, as well 
as the prohibition of feeding the ignorant along with the injunction 
of feeding the learned which we find in the Smriti texts, we are 
told (I, 349-50), does not apply to guests arriving at the end of the 
Vaisvadeva offering (presenting to the fire before meals). In fact 
the mark of a guest is not his learning and so forth, but simply his 
arrival within the prescribed time-limit after that offering. The 
term ‘guest’, it is further explained (I, 352), excludes one of the 
same village arriving regularly on selected days, and is confined to 
an unknown man arriving on a sudden and suffering from the pangs 
of hunger. Furthermore, the reception of the guest with words of 
welcome, the customary offering for a respectable person, a seat and 
so forth, is the due of the Brahmana alone, while the Kshatriya 
and the rest are simply to be given food at the Brahmana’s residence 
(I, 353). These extracts illustrate the continuance of the old Smriti 
rule inculcating universal, though not indiscriminate, charity, some¬ 
what limited by the exigencies of caste. It remains to mention that 
the householder’s duty of hospitality to guests is impressively set 
forth in the Smriti sections of the late Purdnas (Brihaddharma 
Purdna, II. 5.34-36, 15.26-30; Brodimavaivartta Purdna, 84.1.ff.). 

As regards the duties and occupations of the Sudras our authors 
betray a twofold attitude. The complete dependence of the Sudra 
upon the Brahmana is reflected in such works as the Pardsara- 
Mddhava (I, 418-20), where we are told that the Sudra’s highest duty 
is the service of the Brahmana, as it ensures for him supreme bliss, 
along with his distinctive occupation; while, by contrast, the service 
of the Kshatriya and the Vaisya is his subordinate duty, as it secures 
for him merely his occupation. It is emphasized still more in the 
Brihaddharma Purdna (III, 4-5; 24-25; 31-32). On the other hand, 

577 

n. S .—>37 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


our authors tend to relax the strict Smriti rule forbidding dealings 
in certain classes of commodities by a Sudra engaged in trade in 
default of service, and they justify this by reference to different 
occasions as well as different grades of Sudras. The prohibition of 
the sale of five specified classes of commodities, we are told in the 
Grihastharatndkara (479-80), applies to the Sudra in normal times, 
but not in times of distress; the parallel set of prohibitions, the 
author further observes, refers to good Sudras and not to condemned 
ones: the Sudra does not become an outcaste even by selling meat, 
and so forth. The prohibition of the sale of salt and the like, we 
are told more briefly in the Parasara-Mddhava (I, 422-23), applies 
to Brahmanas engaged in trade in times of distress, but the Sudras 
incur no blame on that account, although they are forbidden in other 
texts to deal with liquors and meat. 

The older religious disabilities of the Sudras are repeated by 
our authors with a certain tendency to relax them within the nar¬ 
row canonical limits. The Sudras, according to the Brihaddharma 
Parana (III, 4. 15-32), must not practise the Vedic or the ordinary 
religious exercises, and he must not study the Vedas or the Puranas 
nor explain the sacred texts, but he may listen to recitations of the 
Puranas and study as much of the Agamas (Tantras) as is permitted 
to him by his guru: he must not utter mantras with the words 
svdhd and om. Discussing a hypothetical argument which questions 
the Sudra’s right to enter upon the householder’s life, the Pardsara- 
Mddhava (I, 537) concludes that the Sudra is so entitled on the 
ground of reference to him in the section on marriage and to his 
rights in the section on householder’s duties of the type of the five 
great sacrifices. Similarly discussing an argument which disquali¬ 
fies the Sudra for rites capable of being performed only by offering 
to the sacred fires, the Madanapdrijdta (231) concludes that when¬ 
ever the Sudra is allowed to offer oblations to the fire, he should 
perform the same in the ordinary fire, and that he should use only 
the mantra consisting of the single word namaskdra, as he is not 
entitled to use any other. 

As regards the Sudra’s social disabilities our authors’ views 
vary from comparative laxity to extreme rigidity. In the face of 
strong condemnation of eating food from a Sudra in a Smriti 3 the 
Grihastharatndkara (334) explains that the prohibition refers to the 
food of condemned Sudras, while the food of good Sudras may be 
eaten (the author slyly adds) for the purpose of gaining cows, 
lands, and so forth, but not otherwise. Referring to the permission 
even for Brahmanas to take the food of five specified classes of 
Sudras, the author further explains (337) that their uncooked food 


578 


HINDU SOCIETY 


may be eaten in normal times and even their cooked food may be 
taken in times of distress. This explanation is repeated by Sulapapi 
(on Yajnavalkya, I, 166). By contrast, the Parasara-Mddhava 
(HI, 305) mentions the penances of different grades which a Brah- 
mana, eating a Sudra’s food, must undertake according as he does 
it intentionally, or in a time of distress, or else unintentionally. The 
author expands this statement in another context (III, 379-80), 
where he explains that not only eating the Sudra’s food, but living 
in the same house with him, sitting in the same cart with Sudras 
engaged as agricultural labourers, and receiving religious instruc¬ 
tions from a learned Sudra whose sense of right and wrong has been 
developed by listening to the recitations of the Puranas and so 
forth, are to be avoided. The author likewise (III, 325) qualifies the 
Smriti permission to eat four varieties of the Sudra’s food by ex¬ 
plaining that it applies to the Kshatriyas and the Vaisyas at a time 
when they are tired by the toils of journey, and are unable to pro¬ 
cure food from other castes, and that the food in any case should be 
limited to just what is sufficient to save one’s life in times of distress. 
This is further qualified by the statement (III, 327) that for the 
above purpose the food of condemned Sudras, like that of Chandalas, 
should not be taken, while the food of good Sudras may not be 
avoided. The author concludes (III, 337) with clarification of the 
Smriti rule admitting the lawfulness of the food of certain specified 
classes of Sudras, although, somewhat inconsistently, he elsewhere 
(I, 123-27) quotes with approval the Kalivarjya text including the 
acceptance of food of five classes of Sudras in the list. The extreme 
limit of the Sudra’s social disability is reached in the Madanapdrijata 
(133) justifying by argument a quotation which requires purifica¬ 
tion by bathing with clothes on, for touching a Sudra. The diverg¬ 
ence of our authors’ views is reflected in two contradictory inter¬ 
pretations of Mann’s celebrated dictum about the natural as well 
as the divinely ordained servitude of the Sudra. On the one hand 
the Vivddaratndkara (146), applying the dictum to the general clause 
of law permitting four specified classes of Sudras to be released by 
the master’s favour, observes that the clause does not apply to the 
Sudra. Applying the same dictum to the clause which makes a 
Brahmana liable to punishment for enslaving men of the three upper 
classes out of greed, the author states that he who forcibly reduces 
a Sudra to slavery is exempt from punishment. On the other hand, 
the Vivtidachintamani (68), quoting the same dictum, observes that 
it is meant simply to deprecate the condition of the Sudra, for 
otherwise there would be no such dealings as the sale of Sudras and 
so forth (which are laid down in the Smritis).

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


At the end of this brief survey of the status of the four castes 
after our authors, we may notice their references to the discrimi¬ 
natory clauses, caste-wise, of the Smriti penal law. These clauses, 
which provide for punishment for the same offence committed by a 
Brahmana, a Kshatriya, a Vaisya and a SSudra on an ascending scale, 
are repeated often at great length in the Smriti Digests and Commen¬ 
taries of our period. Not only, however, was their operation neces¬ 
sarily restricted by the occupation of large tracts of the country by 
the arms of Islam, but our authors occasionally drop hints about the 
disuse of the old discriminatory clauses, as when the Vyavahara- 
vivekoddyota, concluding its chapter on defamation and assault, 
observes that although many other varieties of punishment have 
been laid down in the Smritis according to the differences of subject- 
matter under these heads, kings in these times are unable to put 
them into effect for fear of rousing popular discontent. 

Of more practical application than the above are our author’s 
references to the discriminatory clauses in the Smriti law of 
penances. The Madanaparijata (791-92), in the context of its state¬ 
ment of the penances for Bmhmana-murder, upholds a Smriti rule 
fixing the penances in the ratio of 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 for Brahmanas, Ksha- 
triyas, Vaisyas and Sudras, so as to make an inconvenient text 
(Sankha) yield the forced interpretation that the diminishing scale 
of penance 1 : J : i : J according to the order of the castes refers to the 
diminishing capacity of the individual sinner irrespective of caste. 
This is followed by the author’s clear and emphatic statement, on the 
authority of Vijhanesvara, that the rule fixing the penances for the 
Brahmana, the Kshatriya, the Vaisya and the Sudra in the diminishing 
proportions, as mentioned above, applies to other matters than the 
four specified crimes of violence. The ascending scale of penances, 
is likewise applied in respect of various sins in the Prayaschittasdra 
(30 and 36) and in Sulapani’s commentary on Yajnavalkya (II. 250). 
This is justified by the argument just stated that the descending 
scale of penances applies to matters other than the four crimes 
of violence (which are specified in the Prayaschittasdra (36)) as 
comprising homicide, theft, criminal assault on other men’s wives, 
and assault in general). Elsewhere (121), however, the Pmyaschitta¬ 
sdra prescribes the same penances for Brahmana, Kshatriya and 
Vaisya on the ground of silence of the texts about the descend¬ 
ing scale of the same. The Madanaparijata (869) neatly sums up 
its view by stating that the descending scale of penances applies to 
the minor sins, and the ascending scale to the mortal sins. 

In so far as the group of mixed castes is concerned, we may 
notice a short discussion in the Pamsara-Madhava (I, 512-13) about 


580 


HINDU SOCIETY 


the status of the anuloma castes, meaning those supposed to have 
sprung from the unions of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas with 
girls of inferior castes. Repeating the view of Manu, the author 
observes that the issue of a Brahmana by his married Kshatriya 
wife is similar to, but not quite the same as, a Brahmana, because 
of connection with his low-caste mother, and that the same is the 
case with the issue of such other unions. The view of Vishnu and 
Sahkha, assigning to the issue of anuloma marriages the caste of the 
mother, we are further told, refers to their acquisition of the duties 
of the mother’s caste, while they are proved on the contrary to form 
a separate caste by the fact that otherwise the superiority of the 
father would have no application. The above discussion proves the 
author’s position to be midway between the exceptional Smriti 
view elevating the issues of anuloma marriages to their father’s 
caste, and the ordinary view degrading them to the caste of their 
mother. 3 

As regards the despised castes our authors recapitulate the 
Smriti rules about their degraded status. The Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 
257-58) explains after quoted texts that one touching a Chandala 
at the first, the second and the third remove, should purify himself 
by bathing with his clothes on, while one doing so at the fourth 
remove should merely touch the water. Purification by bathing 
should be undertaken in both cases, when the touch is intentional. 
The Chandala, we are elsewhere (III, 387-88) told in amplification 
of the original text, should be kept at a distance of four yugas (the 
length being understood in the light of popular usage): one coming 
nearer without touching him should bathe with his clothes on: one 
touching him unintentionally should bathe and look at the Sun 
(by way of purification), and one doing so intentionally should per¬ 
form double this penance or some other act of purification. Explain¬ 
ing the detailed description in the original, the author elsewhere 
(III, 81-94) mentions the different penances to be undertaken by a 
Brahmana for conversing or sleeping on the same bed, or going in 
company with a Chandala, for looking at or touching a Chandala, 
for drawing water from a pond owned by a Chandala, for drinking 

water from a well wherefrom water has been drawn in a Chandala’s 

• • 

vessel, for unwittingly eating a Chandala’s food or living for some 
time in the same house with him, for association with a Chandala 
on a journey to a field or garden or another village, and lastly in 
the event of a Chandala’s entrance into the house even once. The 
author likewise mentions the similar but less severe penances for 
drinking water from the vessels of other despised classes such as 
washermen and so forth, and for association with them. 


581 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


A pattern of social structure, somewhat different from the 
above, prevailed in the different regions of the country according 
to the realistic accounts of this period. In the Hindu kingdom of 
Vijayanagara, for instance, there were, next to the Brahmanas, 
such important caste-groups as Chettis (merchants), VIra Panchalas 
(artisans), Kaikkolas (weavers), and barbers. There were besides 
immigrant castes from the north like the Tottiyars, the Saurashtras 
and the Reddis, whose influx resulted in degradation of certain indi¬ 
genous castes like the Kurumbars. The lowest caste consisted of 
the Dombaras (jugglers and soothsayers), Jogis, Maravaras, and so 
forth. The disputes between the various middle castes above men¬ 
tioned (and specially between the two great divisions of the right- 
hand and left-hand castes) made up much of the social history of 
those times. In so far as the Brahmanas were concerned, they were 
treated with the traditional high respect by kings and nobles alike. 
In agreement with the Smriti standards of the south, as mentioned 
above, the Brahmanas were employed on a variety of occupations, 
namely, as merchants and agriculturists, ministers and provincial 
governors, generals and commanders of fortresses. 4 A cross section 
of the social structure in the Vijayanagara Empire, which is but very 
imperfectly noticed in the Smritis, consisted of the great ministers 
and other officials, as well as the feudatories (amaranayakas) hold¬ 
ing charge of districts on condition of furnishing financial contri¬ 
butions and military contingents, on the one side, and the mass of 
the people on the other side. 5 

3. Slavery 

Slavery was fairly common, and the matter-of-fact way in which 
Ibn Batutah refers to the acquisition of slave-girls in lots, and their 
distribution as ordinary gifts or presents, throws a lurid light on the 
moral ideas of the time. A sort of communal spirit seems to have 
prevailed in this matter. The Muslims took delight in enslaving 
Hindu women en masse from the highest to the lowest rank, and 
many of them, including even those who once were princesses, 
were forced to entertain the Muslim court and the nobility with 
dance and music. Sultan Mahammad bin Tughluq made free gifts 
of them to his relations and the nobility, and sent as presents to the 
Chinese Emperor “one hundred male slaves and one hundred slave 
songstresses and dancers from among the Indian infidels”. On the 
other hand, according to Nizam-ud-dm, “even Musalmans and Sayyid 
women were taken by the Rajputs and were turned into slave 
girls. They were taught the art of dancing and were made to join 
the akhavas.” 5a 


582 


HINDU SOCIETY 


The Smriti authorities of this period repeat the clauses of law 
relating to slavery in the older texts under the familiar head of 
law called ‘non-rendition of service after making a contract to 
serve or obey.’ 5b It will suffice to quote here their comments on 
the rules for the emancipation of slaves. Expanding the Smriti clause 
on this point the Prdsara-Madhava, the Vivddachandra, the Vivada- 
chintdmani and the Vyavaharakanda observe that not only the four 
classes of slaves (one born in the household, one purchased, one 
acquired, and one inherited), but one who has sold himself to slavery, 
are released by the masters’s favour, the privilege being extended 
still further in the Vyavahdravivekoddyota so as to apply to all 
classes other than those who have fallen off from the monastic order. 
According to the Vyavahdravivekoddyota and the Vyavaharakdrida, 
five other specified classes of slaves are released simply by saving 
the master from imminent danger of his life, the Pardsara-Madhava 
extending this privilege to all classes of slaves. On the other hand, 
the Vivddaratndkara, Vivddachandra and the Vivddachintdmani 
limit the application of the equitable Smriti rule, requiring the 
master begetting a son on his female slave to release them both, 
by stating that this should be done when the master has no other 
son. Coming to the historical records we may state that slavery, 
to judge from the combined evidence of the contemporary inscrip¬ 
tions as well as foreign accounts, was a recognized institution in the 
Hindu Empire of Vijayanagara. 6 

A word may be said here about a disreputable class of women 
whom we had occasion to notice in the course of our survey of the 
preceding periods. From the combined testimony of a number of 
foreign observers (Abdur Razzak, Barbosa and Paes) and a Kanarese 
poem, we can estimate the large numbers and the affluence of the 
courtesans at the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. The combined 
evidence of inscriptions and foreign notices in the same area like¬ 
wise points to continuance of the institution of dancing girls in the 
service of temples. 7 

4. Mojrriage 

The elaborate rules, relating to marriage, in the Smritis are 
repeated, often at great length, by our authors with occasional com¬ 
ments, which will chiefly concern us here. Thus, in the first place, 
inter-caste marriages among the three upper classes are included 
in the list of forbidden practices of the Kali Age, quoted with ap¬ 
proval in the Pardsara-Madhava, (I, 123-27) and the M adanapdrij at a 
(15-16). This would tend towards the creation of strictly endo- 
gamous castes. In fact, however, our authors repeat and amplify 
the old Smriti rules of hypergamy. Summing up its explanation on 


583 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


this point after the canonical standards, the Grihastharatnakara (38) 
observes that girls of other castes ( jatis ) may be married (by a 
Brahmana) one after another in the regular ( anuloma ) order, that 
he becomes liable to censure by doing otherwise, and that the 
Smriti prohibition against marriage with a Sudra girl refers to a 
marriage where another wife (of a superior caste) is available, just 
as the Smriti condemnation of begetting a child on a Sudra wife is 
applicable when the same can be done on another wife. The hyper- 
gamous rule in the Smritis is justified by other authors on more 
worldly grounds. Referring to the texts which recommend a Brah¬ 
mana to marry Kshatriya and other girls in the anuloma order after 
his marriage with a girl of his own caste, the Madanapdrijdta (133-34) 
declares the latter type of marriage to be of the principal kind, and 
the former type to be the less desirable course. For it is a Smriti rule 
that among the two duties laid down for the married man, the first 
(namely, the sacrifices) can be performed only with a wife of the same 
caste, while the second (namely, sexual pleasure) can be enjoyed 
with any married wife. We have a more complete explanation in the 
Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 493-98). While girls both of the same and 
of different castes are suitable for marriage (with a Brahmana), we 
are there told, the former are praiseworthy, but if the Brahmana, 
after first marrying a girl of the same caste for the purpose of his 
religious exercises, feels sexual desire, he may marry girls of inferior 
castes in the respective (prescribed) order. The author next ad¬ 
justs two contradictory views, one condoning the Brahmana’s union 
with a Sudra girl, and the other requiring a Brahmana and a Ksha¬ 
triya to avoid her, by observing that they reflect the opinions of 
different authorities (as is illustrated by a text of Yajhavalkya), or 
else refer to different Age-cycles (as is proved by a text including 
inter-caste marriages of the three upper classes in the list of for¬ 
bidden practices of the Kali Age). 

The Smriti authorities of our period repeat the old exogamous 
rules forbidding marriages on the ground of sameness of gotra and 
pravara as well as of sapinda relationship between the parties to the 
match, and they extend the last relationship, after the great majo¬ 
rity of the older authors, to seven degrees on the father’s side and 
five degrees on the side of the mother. As regards the term sapinda, 
both the Madanapdrijdta' (129-133) and the Pardsara-Mddhava 
(I. 465-66) refer to its double interpretation signifying, after the 
school of the Mitdkshard, those who are connected together by hav¬ 
ing particles of the same body, and after the school of the Ddyabhaga, 
those who are connected because of the ball of rice or its leavings 
offered to the common ancestor at the Srdddha ceremony. But 
while the Madanapdrijdta quotes the former explanation, only for its 


584 


HINDU SOCIETY 


rejection in favour of the latter, the Pardsara-Mddhava, combining 
the two explanations, observes that one should marry a girl who is 
not a sapinda in both senses of the term. The Grihastharatnakara 
(8), by contrast, contents itself with quoting in part the classical 
exposition of Vijnanesvara (on Yajhavalkya, I, 52-53) in favour of 
the former interpretation. To complete our account, the Madana- 
pdrijdta (139-40) and the Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 467-68), as well as 
the commentary of Sulapani (on Yajhavalkya, I, 56), explain away 
the texts narrowing down the sapinda relationship still further to the 
third and the fifth degrees on the mother’s and the father’s side res¬ 
pectively. This is justified by the argument that the said texts apply 
to the issue of an adopted mother or father, or of step-mothers of 
different castes, or of asura and similar disapproved types of mar¬ 
riage, or else to Kshatriyas, and so forth. 

On the question of validity of the ancient South-Indian custom 
of marriage with the daughter of the maternal uncle (mdtula-sutd ), 
—which by the way disregards the Smriti rule of prohibited degrees 
of marriages as between cognates—our authors, like their predeces¬ 
sors, are sharply divided in their opinions. On the one hand, the 
Grihastharatnakara (8 and 10), while pointedly condemning mar¬ 
riage with the mdtula-suta, in the course of its explanation of a verse 
of Manu, quotes the text requiring one to perform a penance for 
marrying such a girl and to maintain her after separation. On the 
other hand, Dalapati, the author of the Sarhskdrasdra , la justifies the 
above custom on the ground of its mention in the Vedas. The strong¬ 
est defence of this custom, mostly after the arguments in the Smriti - 
chandrikd (I, 70-74), is found in the Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 469-73), 
where the author, in the course of a long and learned discussion, 
observes that the custom is justified by the combined authority of 
the Vedas, the Smritis and the customs of cultured men, and he con¬ 
cludes that it is lawful within its particular region, even in respect 
of asura and similar forms of marriage. 8 

The Smriti authorities of this period repeat the arguments of 
their predecessors for explaining the relative importance of the pro¬ 
hibitory rules about marriage. Where (as in the texts prescribing 
marriage with a girl who is not sapinda of the mother), we are told 
in the Madanaparijata (140-42), the injunctions and prohibitions 
have no visible merits and demerits, these can be deduced from the 
scriptures alone, and when a man disregards the same, the girl 
does not become a wife at all; where, however, the injunctions and 
prohibitions are laid down in view of their visible merits and de¬ 
merits (such as auspicious names of girls), their violation does not 
prevent the girl from becoming a wife, but it merely entails a 


585 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


penance. The same explanation is found in the Grihastharatnakara 
(28-29). It is, however, remarkable that the Madanapdrzjdta, after 
quoting a few exceptions to the general rule given above, winds up 
with the remarks that the final decision should be made in accordance 
with regional usage—a statement which is in complete accord with 
the spirit of elasticity of the Smriti rules in these matters. 

Long before this period, the Smritis had enjoined upon guardians 
of girls, under severe moral and spiritual sanctions, the obligation 
of giving them away in marriage before puberty, the age of the girl 
being specifically stated to extend to seven, ten, or, at the most, 
twelve years. The clear and emphatic repetition of this rule is found 
in the Pardsara-Mddhava. The author, in one place (I, 474), quotes 
the texts fixing the relative ages of the bridegroom and the bride 
as 30 and 12, 28 and 8, 30 and 10, 21 and 7, and more generally in 
the proportion of 3:1. Elsewhere (I, 481-82) the author, while 
commending, after the older writers, the guardian’s bestowal of a 
girl not yet of a marriageable age and in fact of an age without any 
sense of shame, explains away a text permitting a girl even after 
puberty to stay in her father’s house till her death rather than be 
given away to an unworthy husband. In yet another context (III, 
120-21) the author quotes the appropriate texts so as to emphasize 
the impurity of the girl reaching puberty in her father’s house, as 
well as that of the guardians failing to give her away before that 
time. Only at the end, he grudgingly allows, that the giving away 
and acceptance of a girl even at twelve years of age is not prohibi¬ 
ted, if she has not attained puberty at that time. Equally empha¬ 
tic is the view of the Madanapdrijdta (149-50). The author enjoins 
upon guardians, after quoted texts, the bestowal of a nagnikd (ex¬ 
plained alternatively as one too young to have any sense of shame in 
the presence of males, and as one who has not attained the age of 
puberty) even upon a worthless husband, rather than keeping the 
girl unmarried beyond her puberty. In accordance with other quot¬ 
ed texts the guardians are required, under strict social and religious 
sanctions, to give away the girl at eight, nine or ten years of age 
when she has not reached puberty. 

In contrast with the above clear statements, those of the 
Grihastharatnakara are singularly rambling and confused. Quoting 
the older Smritis the author explains (39) that the marriage of a 
girl, twelve or sixteen years old, with a bridegroom of thirty years 
of age is commendable, but that of a young girl with a bridegroom 
thrice her age is still more praiseworthy. Modifying the above 
statement in another context (47), the author observes that unlike 
the marriage of a sixteen-year-old girl with a thirty-year-old bride- 


586 



HINDU SOCIETY 


groom, which, though justified by the superior qualities of the hus¬ 
band, is still to be condemned, the marriage of a nagnikd (meaning a 
girl of ten years not knowing as yet how to wear clothes properly) 
is praiseworthy. The author ends, characteristically enough, with 
the forced interpretation of a Mahdbhdrata text so as to make it 
mean that a thirty-year-old bridegroom should marry a sixteen-year- 
old girl or else a nagnikd • In yet another context (83), the author 
quotes, without comment, a Purana text which prescribes diminish¬ 
ing periods of continence immediately after marriage according as 
the ages of the bride and the bridegroom are in the proportion of 
8 : 24, 12 : 30, 16 : 32, and as the bride’s age is 20 or more. 

In the event of a girl failing from various causes to get herself 
married before puberty, the Smritis permit her the privilege of self¬ 
choice ( svayamvara ) of her husband after a short or long period 
of probation. These rules are quoted by our authors with some 
slight explanations. Reconciling the older references to two dis¬ 
tinct time-periods, the Grihastharatnakara (42-43) states that the 
girl should wait for three years if her father or other guardians, 
in spite of their efforts, fail for some reasons to give her away, but 
she .should wait only for the expiry of her three monthly illnesses 
in the contrary case. A girl without guardians, we are told in the 
Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 483-84), may select a husband with the neces¬ 
sary qualifications before reaching puberty: even where there is the 
father or other guardian, the girl on reaching puberty should await 
their decision for a little while, and in case they are indifferent 
she should herself select her husband. Referring to the different 
time-periods prescribed by the authorities, the author further ob¬ 
serves, that while normally waiting for three years, she need wait 
only for the three months, as stated above, if a sufficiently qualified 
bridegroom is available. In the absence of other corroborative evid¬ 
ence it is not possible to ascertain how far these radical rules were 
still observed in actual practice. 

The eight forms of marriage known to the ancient Smritis, 
along with their estimate of the comparative merits and demerits 
of the same, are quoted with pedantic thoroughness by our authors. Sa 
It will be enough to mention here a striking defence of the disap¬ 
proved forms of marriage in the Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 489-90) and 
the Madanapdrijata (157). Replying to a hypothetical objection 
that dsura and the like marriages, in the absence of the ceremony 
of taking the seven steps ( saptapadl ) together, do not produce the 
relationship of husband and wife, the authors state that this cere¬ 
mony can be performed after the union, and therefore, the girl 
certainly becomes a wedded wife. 


587 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The old Smriti rules, permitting the revocation of marriage in 
certain special circumstances, are repeated by our authors. A girl, 
says the Madanaparijdta (150-53), may be given away to another 
bridegroom after the ceremony of selection ( varana ), but before that 
of saptapadi, in the event of detection of defects on either side, 
since the relationship of husband arises only after the last-named 
ceremony. The same rule applies in the case of a bridegroom dying 
before the saptapadi (the girl in this case being asked to be given 
away to the bridegroom’s younger brother or a man of the same 
gotra or any other man in the order of sequence), of a girl carried 
away by force but not married with the utterance of the sacred 
texts, of a bridegroom going away to another country after selection 
of the bride and payment of the nuptial fee (the bride in this case 
being required to wait for a specific period of time), and lastly, of 
a bridegroom wanting in the qualifications of family, character and. 
so forth. The author, however, qualifies his approval by stating that 
the practice of giving away the girl to the younger brother of the 
deceased husband, and so forth, like the one immediately mentioned 
before, is hateful to the people and as such should be followed in 
accordance with the regional usage. Referring to the same Smriti 
rules the Grihastharatnakara (48) explains that while the girl given 
away in any one of the first five forms of marriage can be given only 
once, one taken in marriage in accordance with the three other 
forms can be given away afresh to a worthier bridegroom. The cere¬ 
mony of selection, we are further told (54), is not sufficient for the 
creation of wifehood in the event of a fault being found in the bride¬ 
groom. We may quote, lastly, the author’s neat summary of Narada’s 
celebrated text enumerating fourteen classes of eunuchs, and ner- 
mitting revocation of marriage with them after short or long 
periods. When the defects of any one of these classes, we are 
told (33), are known beforehand, the girl should not be married to 
him: when the girl is married in ignorance of these defects, the 
man should be medically treated and the result should be awaited: 
when the man is proved to be beyond cure, the girl should be married 
to another, even though she had been given in marriage to the 
former. 

The lead of the canonists of the preceding period forbidding re¬ 
marriage of widows is followed by our authors. The re-marriage of 
girls, whether the marriage has been consummated or not, occurs in 
the list of forbidden practices of the Kali Age quoted with approval 
in the Pardsara-Madhava (I, 123-27), and that of girls whose mar¬ 
riage has not been consummated is found in the similar list of the 
Madanaparijdta (15-16). Consistently with this attitude the 
Pardsara-Madhava (I, 492-93, III, 44) interprets a number of texts. 


588 


HINDU SOCIETY 


clearly in favour of widow re-marriage, as referring to another 
Age-cycle. 

On the subject of the mutual duties of the husband and the 
wife, our authors repeat the old Smriti view with occasional com¬ 
ments. According to the Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 506) it is the hus¬ 
band’s duty properly to maintain his wives, irrespectively of their 
youth or old age, provided they are of good behaviour. The 
Grihastharatndkara (86) quotes a text making the husband liable 
to heavy punishment for abandoning his chaste and gentle wife, 
and compelling him to take her back. By neglecting to maintain 
his wife who has been given to him by the gods, we are told in the 
Vyavahdravivekoddyota (318), the husband becomes guilty of in¬ 
juring them: even the wicked wife should be given maintenance 
in the shape of bad food and so forth. The husband deserting his 
faithful wife, it is further declared (319), should be fined and com¬ 
pelled by the king to take her back, failing which the husband should 
be made to pay her one-third of his property if he is rich, and what 
is sufficient for her maintenance, if he is poor. On the wife’s part, 
she has, we are told in the Madanapdrijdta (190-96), the obligation 
of leading a life of studied dependence (she should not act independ¬ 
ently even in domestic affairs), of sobriety (she should be restrained 
in her dress and behaviour in the presence of superiors and she 
should avoid bad company), and above all of absolute devotion and 
loyalty to her husband: she should adopt a life of ascetic restraint 
during her husband’s absence abroad. The wife despising her hus¬ 
band on any account, such as poverty, explains the Pardsara-Mddhava 
(III, 30 and 34), commits great sin and, as such, is liable to the 
prescribed penance, while the wife, undertaking vows and so forth 
in disregard of service to her husband, should propitiate him and 
perform a penance at his dictation: the wife, undertaking a vow 
without the husband’s permission, is purified by the fact of fruit¬ 
lessness of her endeavour and is not liable to a separate penance. 

The specific moral as well as physical defects of the wife justi¬ 
fying her supersession by the husband, along with the time-lags for 
certain varieties of these defects, are repeated by our authors after 
the old Smriti law. The Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 508) somewhat re¬ 
laxes the strict Smriti rule on this point by stating expressly that 
out of the two kinds of supersession, the one meant for fulfilling 
the law in the shape of begetting a legitimate son and so forth is 
justified by the occasions mentioned, but the other which is intended 
for gratifying sexual passion needs no such occasion. Nevertheless 
we are told (509), that the husband, in the latter case, must propi¬ 
tiate the wife, failing which he should be compelled by the king 


589 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


to pay her one-third of his property, or to maintain her with food 
and clothing, according as he is rich or poor. The superseded wife, 
if she has not been given stridhana before, should get as much as 
is given to the newly married wife, and in the contrary case, she 
should get half of the same 8b or as much as would make their shares 
equal. 80 

The old Smriti rule, relating to the abandonment of women in 
special circumstances, is relaxed in one respect, and intensified on 
another point, in the Kalivarjya text quoted with approval in the 
Parasara-Mddhava (I, 123-27). On the one hand, it prohibits the 
abandonment of women of honoured relationship on the ground of 
sexual connection with men of low castes, although it is a fact that 
some Smriti texts (Vasishtha and Brihaspati) had expressly required 
women guilty of such connection to be abandoned. On the other 
hand, the above-mentioned text forbids social intercourse with 
women who have been polluted by rape and so forth, even after 
their performance of the prescribed penance, such women having 
been held previously (Vasishtha, Atri and Parasara) to become 
pure after penance and their own monthly illness. A complete 
explanation of the occasions justifying the abandonment of women 
is given in the Parasara-Madhava- While a couple, belonging to the 
despised caste and incapable of performance of the ceremony of 
marriage, incur no blame by mutual separation on account of dis¬ 
agreement (II, 324-25), a wife, taken in accordance with the cere¬ 
mony of marriage can be abandoned only for unchastity, for wanton 
character, and for other specified serious crimes. While the act of 
hating her kinsmen, to the point of applying poison or black magic 
and so forth against them, as well as of procuring abortion, makes 
the women equally liable to be cut off from conversation (III, 32). 
the latter act is incapable of expiation, and the guilty woman must 
certainly be abandoned. On the treatment of the abandoned women, 
our authors explain and expand the older views. Fallen women, 
equally with men, we read in the Madanapmjata (968), are to be 
abandoned in the event of their not performing the (appropriate) 
penance, and to be taken back after its performance, but there is 
this special rule that the women in the former case are to be allowed 
residence near the house as well as food and clothing. Neither 
death nor mutilation, according to the Vivddaratndkara (426) and 
the Pardsara-Mddhava (II, 325), is to be the lot of the abandoned 
woman. A woman abandoned for specified crimes, we read in the 
Pardsara-Mddhava: (II, 324-25), in the context just quoted, should 
be denied conjugal relations and participation in Vedic and Smriti 
rites as well as conversation and so forth, while one abandoned for 


590 


HINDU SOCIETY 


disease and the like should be denied conjugal relations alone. A 
woman guilty of proved unchastity, as when she becomes pregnane 
by her paramour in the event of her husband’s death or prolonged 
residence abroad, it is further observed (III, 284-90) by the same 
author, shall be banished to a foreign land; a woman of suspected 
unchastity, as when a Brahmana woman goes out to another village 
or country to live with a man who is not her guardian and to whom 
she has made advances of love, cannot be allowed to return to her 
residence; a woman going out wilfully to live in another village 
cannot be permitted to return to her kinsmen even after performing 
a penance, for the Smriti ban against the abandonment of women 
applies (only) to one who is repentant for her act and is entitled to 
penance for the same; a woman, angrily leaving her house herself 
and alone for being assaulted by her guardians for her faults, may 
return home within ten days without being liable to a penance, but 
a Brahmana woman returning home after these days of grace is 
incapable of penance and is to be abandoned, and even the house 
where she is given shelter becomes impure like that of the Chandalas. 

The Smritis, from the time of Brihaspati onwards, inculcate 
upon the widow, the obligation of self-immolation on the funeral 
pyre of her husband ( sahamarana, anumarana, or anugamana , com¬ 
monly known as sail ) as her alternative or else as her exclusive duty. 
The former view is repeated in the Madanapdrij at a (196-203). The 
author, it is true, explains that the injunction (after Harita) to per¬ 
form sahamarana is the general duty of all chaste wives, other than 
those who are pregnant or have infant children, down to the 
Chandalas. Where the husband has died abroad, it is further ex- 
plained, the Brahmana widow may certainly burn herself along with 
his bones, while a widow of another caste, failing to procure the 
bones, may burn herself with or even without any of his symbols. 
The author, again, offers a double defence of self-immolation after the 
Digests of the preceding period, namely, that the ban on Brahmana 
women (Paithmasi, Angiras and others) refers to their mounting a 
separate pyre, and that the Vedic passage forbidding unapproved 
suicide in general terms does not conflict with the Smriti text spe¬ 
cially prescribing suicide (to the widow) by entering the fire on her 
husband’s death. On the other hand, the author, after stating that 
self-immolation is an optional rite as being attended with the re¬ 
ward of heaven and the like, emphatically rejects the contrary view 
declaring it to be a compulsory rite, by pointing to Manu’s silence in 
this matter. This is followed, significantly enough, by a long quota¬ 
tion tending to show that the observance of the vows of widowhood 
likewise procures (for the woman) the reward of heaven and so 
forth. The view declaring self-immolation to be the widow’s 


591 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


exclusive duty finds its emphatic support in the Parasara-Madhava 
(III, 45-49). While great bliss, we are told by the author after the 
original text, attends the widow adopting a vow of chastity instead 
of contracting a second marriage, she earns still greater merit by fol¬ 
lowing her husband on the funeral pyre; in fact while the chaste 
wife, performing the ceremony, brings bliss both on herself and on 
her husband, the sinful wife is released from her sins by this act. This 
statement is accompanied by the double defence of the rite as above 
mentioned. The author concludes with the remark that subject to 
the usual restrictions all women are eligible for sahamarana. That 
the above discussions, involving the qualified or absolute sanction 
of self-immolation by the widow, must be interpreted in a limited 
sense, is proved by the fact that the same authors elsewhere (as we 
shall presently see) vindicate the widow’s right as the foremost 
heir of her sonless and divided husband, the author of Pardsara- 
Madhava taking the lead in this respect. 

The most authentic evidence of the prevalence of satl in differ¬ 
ent areas is furnished by the contemporary historical records. It 
is noticed as a peculiar custom of the Indians of Quilon on the 
Malabar coast by Friar Odoric (c. A.D. 1321-22), and of ‘India the 
Less’ (meaning Sind and the western coast as far as the north 
of Malabar) by Friar Jordanus (A.D. 1323-1330). We have eye¬ 
witnesses’ accounts of the performance of satl near Dhar in Malwa 
by Ibn Batutah (1342), and in the Vijayanagara Empire by Nicolo 
Conti and Duarte Barbosa in the beginning of the fifteenth and six¬ 
teenth centuries respectively. The two last-named writers testify 
to the large numbers of wives and female slaves who burnt them¬ 
selves along with their deceased husbands and masters in the Hindu 
empire. We have a striking reminiscence of the Smriti doctrine 
on this point in the statement of Odoric that women, with sons, 
were exempted from the performance of satl , and of Ibn Batutah 
that the custom was not obligatory, although highly esteemed. Ibn 
Batutah further adds that permission had to be obtained from the 
Sultan to burn the widow. 9 

55. Position of women 

The Smriti authorities of this period extensively quote the old 
doctrine of perpetual subjection of women as well as that of their 
lifelong tutelage under their male relations at successive stages of 
their lives. They quote likewise the corollary of these doctrines 
in the shape of the duty of the husband to guard his wife well by 
keeping her engaged in household work and so forth in the interest 
of the families of both and of their progeny. 9a Our authors repeat 


592 


HINDU SOCIETY 


in particular the religious disabilities of women (such as their dis¬ 
qualification for Vedic study and sacrament in accordance with 
Vedic mantras ) after the older texts. We may quote in this con¬ 
nexion the very characteristic explanation of the Pardsara-Mddhava 
(I, 484) and the Madanapdrijdta (37), that the division of women 
into two classes (after Harlta), namely, brahmavadinis or ‘students 
of sacred lore’ (who go through the ceremonies of upanayana or in¬ 
vestiture with the sacred thread, keeping the sacred fire, begging 
for alms within their own household) and sadyovadhus or ‘those 
who are married straightway’ (for whom, as the time for marriage 
draws near, the upanayana is performed somehow), belongs to a 
different time-cycle (Kalpa). 

The penalties for women under the Smriti criminal law, which 
include capital punishment with revolting cruelty for a number of 
serious crimes under the heads of violence ( sdhasa ) and adultery 
(strlsamgrahana) , are repeated by our authors. References are made 
simultaneously by them to the remarkably humane rule of Katya- 
yana that women are liable to half the fine payable by men, and that 
they are to lose a limb where the men are punished with death. In 
view T of the fact that the operation of the Smriti penal law was neceS' 
sarily restricted by the occupation of large tracts of the country 
by Muslim rulers, and that the above penalties are repeated by our 
authors without any serious comment, it may be surmised that their 
application at this period was largely a matter of academic interest. 

Of more practical importance than the above are our authors’ 
references (with a distinct tendency towards their lenient interpreta¬ 
tion) to the penance for women in the Smriiis. Thus the special 
rule, prescribing half the penance for women as compared with men, 
is applied to particular types of sins in the Pardsara-Mddhava (III, 
29 and 34) and the Prdyaschittasdra (32, 56, 64 and 75), although 
the Madanapdrijdta (891-92), by way of exception, makes the 
women liable to the very same penances as men for one of the 
mortal sins. Women are exempted from tonsuring the head accord¬ 
ing to a quotation in the Prdyaschittasdra (22), and from a longer 
list of such penances after a quotation in the Madanapdrijdta (870). 
Although women (of the three upper classes), conceiving as a result 
of illicit intercourse with a Sudra paramour, we are told in the 
Pardsara-Mddhava (III, 115-16), cannot be purified and must be 
abandoned, a woman doing so by connexion with a man of another 
caste is purified by penance; a woman guilty of unchastity, not re¬ 
sulting in conception, is purified by the appropriate penance, or even 
by her monthly illness, according as the sin is physical, mental or 
verbal. Elsewhere (280), the author, meeting the objection that a 

598 


D. S.— 38 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


woman having connexion with a Chandala cannot be purified by 
the observance of vows but must be abandoned, argues that like 
land contaminated by the residence of Chandalas and so forth which 
is reclaimed by the operations of digging (the soil), applying colour¬ 
wash (to the wall), and so forth, a woman in the above situation 
can be reclaimed by the performance of vows. To this the only 
qualification is that Brahmana women are purified by special 
penances. 

The most considerable development of our authors’ ideas on 
the present subject relates to the women’s property rights. Thus, 
in the first place, they amplify Yajnavalkya’s clause of law (I, 115) 
about partition of property by a father among his sons and wives. 
The father, says the VivticLaratnakara (65), should make his wives 
equal or unequal sharers, according as he gives equal or unequal 
shares to his sons. This is subject to the explanation that a wife, 
not receiving wealth from her husband or father-in-law (as 
strldhana), should receive as much wealth as would make her share 
equal to that of her son, and in the contrary case, a half share. 
Where the sons, born of the Brahmana and other wives, we are 
told more fully in the Madanapdrijdta (662-63), take equal shares, 
their mothers likewise receive the same, and where the sons by 
a Kshatriya, a Vaisyia and a iSudra wife take their shares in the 
proportion of f, \ and i respectively, their mothers also follow 
suit. According to the VyavaMravivekoddyota (331), the mother 
takes equal share with her sons at partition after the father’s death 
if she has no strldhana, but she takes a half share at partition dur¬ 
ing as well as after the father’s lifetime, if she has the same. The 
author, in the same context, rejects the view of an anonymous autho¬ 
rity, permitting the mother and the rest to take what is necessary 
for their bare existence, as well as the view of Smritichandrikd, 
allowing them to take what suffices for their subsistence where 
the property to be divided is large, and an equal share where it 
is small. Expanding Yajnavalkya’s clause (I, 117) about partition 
of property by a father among his sons, Sulapani observes that the 
daughters should divide their mother’s property equally among 
themselves after payment of her debts. 

The widow’s right as the foremost heir of a deceased sonless 
male divided from his family, which was first conceded by Yajna- 
valkya and Vishnu, is repeatedly vindicated by our authors against 
adverse criticisms. The wife, it is explained, is the first heir if 
she is chaste, but not otherwise (Vyavaharavivekoddyota, 359); the 
order of succession, with the wife coming first in the list of heirs, 
applies to all castes, meaning those born of marriages in the anuloma 


594 


HINDU SOCIETY 


and the pratiloma orders, as well as the Brahmanas and the rest. 9b 
The wife, following the vow of widowhood, takes the property of 
a man without principal or subsidiary sons, while one who has 
fallen off from her vow is to get only her maintenance; 90 the wife 
of a man dying without son, grandson, and great-grandson takes 
his property. 93 

The widow’s right is supported with discussions by the other 
authorities. The reference to widows, even of divided and not 
reunited husbands, getting a maintenance alone, says the Vyavahdra- 
vivekoddyota (360), applies to exclusively kept concubines. Similarly 
Sulapani (on Yajhavalkya, I, 135-36), explaining the references to 
brothers and daughters taking the property, observes that the 
former text applies to an unchaste and adulterous wife, while the 
latter passage refers to an appointed daughter. In the next place 
the Vyavahdrakdnda (405-08) justifies the widow’s right to take 
the property before the father on the ground of her greater propin¬ 
quity; the wife (patrii), it is argued, confers greater seen and un¬ 
seen benefits after the Yedic and Smriti standards (upon the de¬ 
ceased)— the patrii being explained to mean a wife who is married 
according to brahma and other approved forms—-and is entitled 
as such to perform the sacrifices, and not a wife who is acquired by 
purchase. According to the Vivddaratndkara (589-93), the reference 
(Manu) to the mother and the father as the heirs of a son dying with¬ 
out issue applies to one who has left no principal or subsidiary sons 
and no wife. The clause of law (Paithmasi) declaring the wife of 
a sonless man to be the heir after the brother and so forth, the author 
continues, refers to one who is other than a chaste wife, and who 
slightly fulfils the duties of widowhood. Giving another explana¬ 
tion of the above clause, the author observes that it refers to pro¬ 
perty other than that which has been earned by the father, the 
grandfather and so forth (or in other words, to self-acquired pro¬ 
perty). 

The fullest vindication of the widow’s right as her husband’s 
foremost heir occurs in the Pardsara-Mddhava (II, 355-60). The 
clause of law (Narada), making the other brothers the heirs in case 
a brother dies without issue, and giving his widow a life-long main¬ 
tenance, the author observes, applies to one who has been re-united 
with his family, or has not been divided at all. Again the clause 
(Manu), mentioning the father or the brother as the heir of a sonless 
man, does not lay down the order of succession, while the rule 
(Katyayana), making the father, the brother, the mother and the 
paternal grandmother, the heirs as above, refers to the case of an 
adulterous wife. The interpretation (Dharesvara and the author of 


595 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Smritisamgraha) that the widow inherits the property provided she 
submits to niyoga (appointment for raising issue to her deceased 
husband), is disproved by the argument inter alia that the vow of 
chastity is imposed upon the widow by a number of Smritis in the 
present context. Other texts giving the widow a bare maintenance 
during her lifetime refer to an exclusively kept concubine, or else to 
a wife guilty of proved or suspected adultery. The author finally 
argues that a Vedic text, held to disqualify women for a share in 
the property, which, by the way, led even such an advanced legist 
as the author of Smritichandrikd to exclude such women as are not 
expressly declared to be heirs in the Smritis, simply means that the 
wife of the sacrificer is not entitled to her share of the Soma juice 
taken in a particular (pdtnivata) cup. 

Besides justifying the position of the widow as the next heir of 
a sonless man divided from his family, our authors vindicate the 
extent and nature of her interest in her husband’s property. The 
clause (Brihaspati) denying to the wives the right of inheriting im¬ 
movable property, we are told in the Pardsara-Mddhava (II, 360), 
means simply that they are forbidden to sell the same without the 
consent of the other heirs. The widow, says the Vyavahdrasdra 
(250) after a Smriti clause, takes the whole property comprising 
movables as well as immovables. According to the Vivddachintd- 
mani (237), the widow should perform the first as well as the yearly 
funeral offerings for her husband and take his whole property. When 
the property is divided, we are told more fully in the Vyavahdra- 
kdnda (408-10), the patnz (as distinguished from a wife procured 
for enjoyment) should take the whole property (along with 

immovables) of her husband, and perform, to the measure of 

this wealth, various pious acts for her own and her husband’s 
spiritual benefit. Adjusting a few contradictory texts after the 

Smritichandrika, the author further observes that where there are 

wives with and without daughters, the former take the immov¬ 
ables and the latter the movables, and where there are only wives 
without daughters, they take both immovables and movables to the 
exclusion of the mother, and so forth. 

The widow’s interest in her husband’s property is most fully 
vindicated in the Vyavahdravivekoddyota (359-63). The clause of 
Brihaspati quoted in the Smritichandrika as denying immovable pro¬ 
perty to women, we are told, is not found in many other Digests and 
authors of Digests, namely, Vijnanesvara, Krityakalpataru, Ratnd- 
kara, Parijdta, Halayudha and others, and it appears, as such, to be 
unacceptable. Even if we are to accept it on the authority of the 
Smritichandrika , it should be taken to refer to a wife married accord- 


596 


HINDU SOCIETY 


ing to the a sura and other disapproved forms, unlike the paint, who is 
married in accordance with brahma and other approved forms. The 
adjustment of contradictory texts in the Smritichandrika, the author 
continues, in the sense that the wife without daughters does not 
take the immovable property while the wife with daughters takes 
the same, seems to be a guess and nothing more. Adjusting a few 
other texts, the author further observes that where the husband has 
died undivided or reunited with his family, his wife gets only food 
and clothing during her lifetime, if she is other than a patni, but if 
she is a paint, she gets as much share out of her husband’s wealth as 
will enable her to live in comfort and to perform her compulsory and 
occasional duties, as well as her optional duties of the kind within 
women’s capacity. The clause (Katyayana) denying to the patni 
the freedom of gift and so forth, we are further told, means that she 
cannot spend the money on actors, dancers and such-like visible ob¬ 
jectives, but she is certainly entitled to gift, pledge or sale of the 
same for “invisible” purposes. The author’s final conclusion is that 
where the husband has died divided and not reunited, the wife is 
entitled to his entire property, both movable and immovable. 

We may briefly notice in this connection our authors’ references 
to other female heirs of a soilless man as described above. Justify¬ 
ing the order of succession after Yajnavalkya, Vyavahdrakdnda 
(413-14) observes that while the daughter’s propinquity to the de¬ 
ceased arises from the invisible benefit conferred through her son, 
the mother’s greater propinquity is derived from the benefit conferred 
through her direct participation in the fire-offering ( agnihotra) and 
other rites (performed by the father). On the other hand, although 
the father himself confers spiritual benefit upon the deceased by the 
performance of his srdddha, the daughter is physically inseparable 
from the latter. The author next rejects the narrow interpretation 
of the daughter in the present context in a number of specified and 
unspecified Digests, as one who was appointed to raise male issue for 
her father having no son of his own. Coming to another point, we 
find that the father is preferred to the mother in the order of succes¬ 
sion in the Vivddachandra (93) and the Vyavahdravivekoddyota 
(364), and the mother to the father in the Vivadarattidkara (595), the 
Vyawakdrasdra (251) and the Vivddachintdmani (241). The mother, it 
is argued in the Vyavakdrasdra after Vijnanesvara, comes before the 
father in the dissolution of the copulative word ( pitarau ) for parents 
in the original, while the mother’s propinquity is greater than the 
father’s. Lastly, we have to observe that the paternal grandmother 
is placed after the brother and the brother’s son in the Vyavakd - 
ravivekoddyota (365) and the Vyavdhdrasdra (252) on the ground 


597 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


that the contrary text of Manu does not lay down the order of succes¬ 
sion. 

We now come to our authors’ treatment of the Smriti law of 

* 

stridhana (which term is used in the technical sense of certain 
special kinds of property acquired by a woman on specified occa¬ 
sions and at different stages of her life). These authorities, namely, 
the Pardsara-Mddhava (II, 368), the Madanapdrijdta (671) and the 
Vyavahdrakdnda (379), give us a comprehensive view of the scope 
of stridhana so as to include under this head, according to the fullest 
interpretation, what is inherited, acquired by partition, received as 
gift, or obtained as treasure trove, and so forth, as well as the nup¬ 
tial fee. A similarly comprehensive definition of sauddyika (dowry) 
is given in the Vivddaratndkara (511) and the Vivddachintdmani 
(217), so as to make it comprise what a girl receives either before 
or after marriage at her father’s or her husband’s residence from 
her father or mother, or their respective families. The remarkable 
clause (Katyayana and Vyasa), limiting the amount of stridhana , is 
interpreted in different ways by our authors. It is taken in its 
narrow literal sense, so as to disqualify the wife for receiving 
stridhana beyond the limit of the prescribed 2000 panas as well as 
immovable property 96 in a slightly wider sense so as to disqualify 
the wife for disposing at her will of property exceeding this limit 
although given by her husband 9f , and in its widest sense so as to 
mean that the limit applies to property given only once during many 
years for the girl’s livelihood and in this case it does not exclude 
immovable property. 9 ^ 

The woman’s dominion over her stridhana is completely recog¬ 
nized by our authors 911 after the older texts. The wife, we read, is 
free to dispose of her sauddyika property (and of stridhana in 
general), comprising both movables and immovables, by gift or sale 
at her will; she can dispose of her property acquired from her 
husband, other than immovables, which she is entitled to enjoy 
during her lifetime and which devolve upon the other heirs there¬ 
after; the husband is civilly and criminally liable (in the sense of 
being forced to pay back the principal with interest and to pay a 
fine) for appropriation of his wife’s stridhana otherwise than on a 
number of specified occasions. Referring to a clause under which 
the husband is liable to pay the value of the stridhana appropriated 
by him even with his wife’s consent, the author of the Vyavahdra - 
kdnda explains that the husband is not dependent upon another, but 
has no independence in respect of his wife’s stridhana, while by con¬ 
trast the lawfully married wife is constantly dependent, though en¬ 
titled to ownership thereafter in respect of her husband’s wealth.

HINDU SOCIETY 


Finally we may mention that our authors repeat after the older texts 
the special rule of succession for the stridhana of the mother so as to 
make full brothers along with full sisters or the unmarried sisters 
alone, or the full brothers alone, or else the mother and the father 
the first heirs according to the particular class of such property. 10 
Following the equitable interpretation of the Mitdkshard and the 
Smritichandirikd our authors further declare that unmarried sisters 
take the property in preference to the married sisters, and among 
married sisters those who are unsettled (i.e. without children or 
with poor husbands or unfortunate) take the same in preference to 
those who are settled. 


6. Food and Drink 

The Smriti rules relating to lawful and forbidden food and drink, 
along with the penances for violation of the same, are repeated, 
sometimes at great length, by our authors. The rules about meat- 
eating, in particular, follow the old pattern, with a distinct tendency 
towards abstention from the same. The Madanapdrijata (338) and 
the Grihastharatndkara (380-81) explain the occasion justifying 
meat-eating in the Smritis, which include, according to the former’s 
interpretation, the preparation of meat for feeding Brahmanas at the 
honourable reception of guests and so forth, and, according to the 
interpretation of the latter, partaking of the same when this is com¬ 
mended by the Brahmanas. Other occasions, explained in the 
Grihastharatndkara , are those when the meat is purified with 
mantras for the purpose of sacrifice, when there is the risk of a 
man losing his life otherwise, when the meat is procured by the 
man himself (in the case of Kshatriyas engaged in hunting animals), 
and when the meat is purchased and eaten after worship of the 
gods. The ban against meat-eating at sraddhas in the Kali Age, 
we are further told by these authors, applies to the Brahmana alone, 
since a Smriti text (Pulastya) prescribes the offering of hermit’s 
food by Brahmanas, of meat by Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, and of 
honey by iSudras respectively. Going further than the above the 
Grihastharatndkara observes that the merit of abstention from meat- 
eating applies likewise to the occasions above mentioned, while the 
Madanapdrijata states that there is no obligation to eat the remnants 
(of meat) offered in honour of the Brahmanas, the gods, the fathers 
and so forth, and that meat-eating on other occasions is attended 
with considerable demerit. According to the &rdddhasdra (57-58), 
the decision of Pulastya, quoted above, is to be followed, in spite of 
the general reference to meat, honey and the like, as fit offerings 
at sraddhas by all castes, while the provision for meat-offering at 
sraddhas and so forth in numerous ( Smriti ) works should be under- 


599 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


stood to apply not to all and sundry (this being hateful to the people), 
but only to those (such as the Kshatriyas and so forth) who are 
inclined towards meat-eating. 

The Smriti rules forbidding or restricting the drink of intoxi¬ 
cants, caste-wise, are repeated and amplified by our authors. The 
Grihastharatndkara (393-95), referring to three kinds of wines 
(surd), —namely, those prepared from rice-flour ( paishti ), from molas¬ 
ses (gaudi) , and from honey or from madhuka flowers ( mddhvi ), 
—repeats the older view that all these are forbidden to the Brah¬ 
manas, while the Kshatriyas and the Vaisyas incur no blame by drink¬ 
ing the last two kinds. Intoxicants ( madya ), we are further told, 
are forbidden only to Brahmanas. The point is stated more fully 
by the other authors. The Madanapdrijdta (813-24), while identi¬ 
fying paishti with surd, and declaring gaudi and mddhvi to be 
equivalent to the same in respect of Brahmanas alone, observes that 
the Brahmana, from his very birth, is forbidden to drink all madyas 
with surd at their head, that the Kshatriya and the Vaisya are 
forbidden to drink surd but not gaudi and other kinds of madya, 
and that neither surd nor madya is forbidden to the Sudra. The 
Pardsara-Mddhava (III, 409-13), after distinguishing in the first in¬ 
stance between eleven kinds of madya, observes that madya is for¬ 
bidden to the Brahmanas but permitted to Kshatriyas and Vaisyas. 
Further it explains the grounds (according as the act is intentional 
or not, is done once or repeatedly, is performed for the treatment of 
a disease, otherwise incurable) for the application of different types 
of penances to Brahmanas. The Prdyaschittasdra (39-45), after first 
quoting the above-mentioned division of madya into eleven kinds 
and of surd into three varieties, and after observing that madya is 
a generic designation of which sura is a species, concludes at the 
end of a short discussion that all madyas are forbidden to the 
Brahmanas, but not to Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, who are in fact ex¬ 
pressly permitted to drink gaudi and mddhvi. In accordance with 
the old Smriti estimate of different varieties of intoxicants, the 
Madanapdrijdta, the Pardsara-Mddhava and the Prdyaschittasdra 
apply the extreme penance of suicide by drinking red-hot surd to 
a Brahmana who has drunk surd (meaning paishti) intentionally 
once, or the other two kinds of madyas repeatedly. In so far as 
the Sudra is concerned, it is significant that the Brihaddharma Purdna 
(III, 4, 27 ) and the PrdyaschUtaviveka (37) substitute the act of 
illicit connexion with a Brahmana woman, in place of drinking 
wine, in the list of five mortal sins for Sudras. 

The Smriti ban on drinking intoxicants by women is applied 
with different degrees of intensity by our authors. Strictly apply- 


600 


HINDU SOCIETY 


ing the rule, the Parasra-Mtidhava (I, 507) requires that wives 
of the three upper classes drinking sura (identified with madya) 
are not only to be superseded, but abandoned. The Grihastharatnd- 
kara (84) more leniently explains that wives of the three upper 
classes drinking madya are to be superseded. Going further than 
this, the Madanapdrijdta (188) observes that the wife is to be super¬ 
seded if she drinks madya forbidden to her proper caste. We have 
a further explanation, though of a somewhat academic character, 
in the Madanapdrijdta (824) where we are told that wives of the 
three upper classes, belonging to all castes down to the Sudras, are 
forbidden to drink surd on pain of suffering half the penance for 
men, and that even the Sudra wife of a Brahmana is forbidden to 
drink any kind of madya on pain of bringing sin upon her husband 
and blame upon her offspring, though not loss of caste either for 
herself or her husband. 

The contemporary historical records partly confirm and partly 
supplement the evidence of the Smritis . The Brahmanas and the 
Kshatriyas among the Maratha people, we are told by Ibn Batutah, 
while living on a diet of rice, vegetables and sesame oil, forbore 
to drink wine which was regarded by them as one of the worst 
vices. From the evidence of Barbosa we learn that Brahmanas and 
Lingayats in the Vijayanagara Empire abstained from eating fish 
or flesh, while the king and the nobles were used to eating fish and 
all kinds of meat except beef. The daily slaughter of countless 
sheep as well as of pigs of excellent quality for food at the capital 
city of Vijayanagara is noticed by Paes. 10a 

7. Standard of Living 

The high standard of living known to the earlier times seems 
to have prevailed at least at the upper levels of society during this 
period. Leaving aside for the present the references to the condi¬ 
tions prevailing in the contemporary Delhi Sultanate, we may quote 
here the authentic evidence relating to the Vijayanagara Empire. 
Speaking of this territory, ‘Abd-ur-Razzaq observes that “all in¬ 
habitants, high or low, down to the artificers of the Bazar” wear 
“jewels and gilt ornaments in their ears and around their necks, 
arms, wrists and fingers”. The male costume, according to Barbosa, 
consisted of clothes with girdles along with short shirts of cotton 
(or silk or coarse brocade) and small turbans (or silk or brocade 
caps). The people, we are told by the same observer, wore “rings 
set with precious stones as well as many ear-rings set with fine 
pearls”, and they anointed themselves after bath with “white sandal 
wood, aloes, camphor, musk and saffron all ground fine and kneaded 


601 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


with rose water.” The women, according to the same traveller, wore 
garments of very thin cotton or silk, while their ornaments consisted 
of “nose-screws made of fine gold wire, sapphire or ruby pendant, 
ear-rings set with many jewels, necklaces of gold and jewels of very 
fine coral beads, bracelets of gold and precious stones and many 
coral beads fitted to their arms.” The height of luxury was reached, 
as in the preceding period, at the royal courts. The splendours of 
the royal palace at Vijayanagara, the display of pomp and magni¬ 
ficence by the kings at their ceremonial public receptions as well 
as on festive occasions like the annual Mahdnavamt festival, their 
huge female establishments including their numerous queens with 
their eunuchs and other attendants, their costly dress and furniture, 
are vividly described by a number of contemporary observers, 
namely, Nicolo Conti (1421), ‘Abd-ur-Razzaq (1443), Varthema 
(1502), Barbosa (1514) and Paes (1522). 11 

8. Trends in general manners andl character 

Some important references, after the Smriti authorities of this 
period, to the manners and general character of the great majority 
of the Indian people who were followers of the indigenous faiths, 
have been given in the foregoing pages. But the point is sufficiently 
important to deserve a more detailed treatment. Firstly, as regards 
the question of rigidity of caste distinctions our authors’ attitude 
indicates some contradictory or at least divergent tendencies. On 
the one hand, they continue to condone (as we have seen above) 
anuloma marriages (even of Brahmanas with 'Sudra girls under 
special circumstances), while simultaneously condemning, in the 
Kalivarjya text, quoted with approval in the PardJara-Mddhava 
(I, 123-27), inter-caste marriages of the three upper classes in general 
terms. On the other hand, they emphasize the immense difference 
between the status of the Brahmana and the Sudra in such passages 
as the Pardsara-Mddhava (III, 171-76), explaining the qualifications 
for membership of the learned assembly ( parishat ) for adjudging 
penances. 12 In the second place our authors, while discussing the 
eligibility of the three upper castes for the order of ascetics, arrive 
at different conclusions: the Madanaparijata (365-73) confines these 
privileges to the Brahmana alone to the exclusion of the Kshatriya 
as well as the Vaisya, and the Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 536-38) extends 
it to all the three castes, with the qualification that the Kshatriya 
and the Vaisya are not to wear the red robe and not to carry 
the (ascetic’s) staff. The opinion of the Madanapdrijdta is followed 
by Sulapiani (on Yajhavalkya III, 56-57). Thirdly, the Madana¬ 
pdrijdta (785-86), discussing the vexed question of the validity of 
killing a desperado ( dtatdyi ) Brahmana, seeks to reconcile the con- 


602 


HINDU SOCIETY 


tradictory texts condemning and exonerating the act, by taking the 
former to mean that killing an dtatayl Brahmana is inherently 
blamable, and the latter to signify that the blame for this act is less 
than that incurred by killing a Brahmana who is not an dtatdyl. 
On the other hand, killing an dtatdyi Brahmana is included in the 
Kalivarjya text quoted as above in the Pardsara-Madhava. Again, 
the Madanapdrijdta (827), explaining Manu’s text (which prescribes 
the penance of courting death by a Brahmana guilty of stealing 
gold), observes that the injunction not to kill Brahmanas and the 
prohibition against killing them for any offence whatever apply to 
matters other than penances. Similarly, while our authors treat 
the penance for suicide in various ways by Brahmanas guilty of one 
or other of the mortal sins, the Kalivarjya text quoted as above in 
the Pardsara-Madhava as well as the shorter passage cited in the 
Mad,anapdrijata (16-17) includes prescription of the penance of death 
in the list of forbidden practices of the Kali Age. In the fourth 
and the last place, we have seen how our authors tend on the one 
hand to emphasize the Sudra’s duty of serving the Brahmana, and on 
the other hand seek to relax the rules relating to dealings in forbid¬ 
den commodities in the case of Sudras engaged in trade. We have fur¬ 
ther seen how the same authors differ on the point of lawfulness 
of the Sudra’s food as well as that of interpretation of Manu’s cele¬ 
brated dictum about the Sudra’s natural servitude. An extreme 
view of the Sudra’s social disabilities is taken in the Kalivarjya list, 
quoted in the Pardsara-Madhava, which includes partaking of food 
of five specified classes of Sudras by the Brahmana householder, and 
engaging Sudras as cooks in householder’s residences among the 
prohibited practices of the Kali Age. The furthest limit in this 
direction is the Smriti passage quoted in the Pardsara-Madhava 
which requires (as we have seen) penance by bathing for touching 
a Sudra. For the rest, our authors agree in combining, as before, 
the eulogy of deserving Brahmanas with condemnation of unworthy 
members of this order, as well as in continuing the old restrictions 
on the Brahmana’s food and drink. Only in the Pardsara-Madhava 
we have a striking relaxation of the strict rule requiring the Brah¬ 
mana to engage in the occupation of agriculture, trade and crafts 
only in time of extreme distress. Lastly, it may be mentioned that 
our authors tend to relax, as mentioned above, the old religious 
disabilities of the Sudras within strictly canonical limits. On the 
other hand, they agree in perpetuating the extreme disabilities of 
the Chandalas and other despised castes. 

On the question of rigidity of social behaviour, the attitude of 
our authors is marked b}^ similar contradictory tendencies. On the 


603 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


one hand the Pardsara-Mddhava (I, 112), following the original text 
of Parasara, explains that there is no degradation from caste for 
conversation and so forth v/ith one fallen from caste (patita) in the 
Kali Age in contrast with former Ages. With this may be compared 
the inclusion of pollution, by contact with a patita, in the Kalivarjya 
text quoted in the same work. This involves relaxation of the strict 
Smriti rule (Manu and Vishnu) prescribing degradation from caste 
for close association with one guilty of the mortal sins. On the other 
hand, social intercourse with individuals of the three upper castes 
making a sea-voyage, even after their performance of the prescribed 
penance, is included in the above-quoted Kalivarjya text. This im¬ 
plies an intensification of the old Smriti rule, which merely includes 
(in Baudhayana and Brihaspati) sea-voyage among the mortal sins, 
and declares (in Manu) a Brahmana undertaking sea-voyage to be 
unfit for a sraddha invitation. 

The position of women was not made worse, but was actually 
strengthened and consolidated on some points by our authors. To 
begin with, they continue, but do not add to, the social and religious 
disabilities of women. Again they repeat the old rules enjoining 
upon the guardians early marriage of girls along with those giving 
the girl the right of self-choice of her husband, and permitting the 
revocation of her marriage with an unworthy bridegroom under 
special circumstances. They reproduce likewise the old rules of 
penance relating to sinful women with a distinct tendency towards 
relaxation of the old severity. Similarly they repeat the old rules 
relating, on the one hand, to the wife’s supreme duty of service and 
devotion to her husband and, on the other hand, to the husband’s 
reciprocal obligation of maintaining the faithful wife together with 
its legal sanctions. The husband is held, as before, to be liable to 
pay compensation extending to one-third of his property to his 
superseded wife. Again, v/hile it is agreed that the abandonment 
of sinful women means their expulsion from the household in ex¬ 
treme cases, it is usually taken to involve their temporary disgrace 
and penance, followed by restoration to their old position. On the 
subject of the widow’s obligation of self-immolation on the funeral 
pyre of her husband, our authors’ opinions vary (as we have seen) 
from its emphatic approval to its qualified recommendation. To 
their great credit, it must finally be said, that they completely vindi¬ 
cate the widow’s right as the foremost heir of her sonless and 
‘divided’ husband, as well as the woman’s complete dominion over 
her special kind of property (stridhana ). 

The old custom of religious suicide was continued during our 
period. The Tirthachintdmani (47-52) and the Gaiigdvdky avail (305- 


604 


HINDU SOCIETY 


10) contain a high eulogy (after the Puranic texts) of suicide (by 
starvation and even by cutting off limbs from the body for being 
devoured by birds and so forth) as well as of natural death at vari¬ 
ous selected spots in Prayaga and its environs. We have a similar 
approval of suicide at Varanasi by entering the fire and so forth in 
the Tlrthachintamani (347) as well as suicide by starvation in the 
waters of the Gariga in the Tlrthachintamani (263) and the Gangd- 
vdkyavail (267-92). The prohibition of suicide by starting on the 
‘Great Journey’ (till one falls dead), as well as of suicide of very 
old people by entering the fire, or falling down from the precipice, 
in the Kalivarjya text above mentioned, is negatived by other re¬ 
ferences. For the Smriti authorities of this period not only continue 
to prescribe suicide in the above and other forms as a penance for 
the mortal sins, but the Madanaparijdta (801) explains that the 
penance of entering the fire belongs to the Kshatriyas alone, and that 
of falling down from the precipice belongs to the other castes as well, 
while it deliberately extends (844) the penance of starting on the 
‘Great Journey’ to Biiahmana women guilty of illicit intercourse 
with Sudras, and so forth, in the pratiloma order. While on this sub¬ 
ject, however, we may notice the tendency of our authorities, namely, 
the Parasara-Madhava (III, 393) and specially the Prdyaschittasara 
(203-06), to amplify the principle of substitutes ( pratydmndyas ) for 
penances according to the diminishing capacity of the sinners. 

The custom of religious suicide, noticed above, is corroborated 
by the evidence of the contemporary foreign observers. How Hindu 
devotees used to cut off their limbs with sharp knives or their necks 
with sharp swords in fulfilment of their vows before their deities in 
Ma‘bar (Coromandel coast) and in “Greater India” (meaning the 
tract extending from Malabar indefinitely towards the east), is 
told by the Friars Odoric and Jordanus respectively. According to 
Ibn Batutah, the Indian people (meaning the Hindus) had the 
custom of drowning themselves voluntarily in the Gariga as an act 
of spiritual merit. 13 

The statements of our authors testify to the continuance of the 
ancient custom of pilgrimages to the scared places (tlrthas) . The 
ritual of pilgrimages to Prayaga, Purushottama (Puri), Konarka, 
the Gariga, Gaya, Varanasi and so forth, is given at great length in 
the Tlrthachintamani, just as that of the pilgrimages to Dvaraka 
and along the Gahga is described in the wo;rks Dvarakd- 
pattala of Binabai and the Gang avdky avail of Visvasadevi (or per¬ 
haps of the poet Vidyiapati) respectively. The sacred legends 
(mdhdtmyas ) of Setubandha-Pvamesvara, Amardaka, Gaya, the Goda¬ 
vari, the Krishnaveni, the Narmada and other tirthas are enumerated 


605 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


m the Tirthasara of Dalapati. The Prdyaschittasdra of the last- 
named author mentions (206-11) pilgrimages to various tirthas as 
pratydmndyas for a number of penances. Among the foreign ob¬ 
servers Xbn Batutah noticed pilgrimage to the Ganga as a peculiar 
Indian custom. 

From the statements of our authors we may conclude that the 
old sentiment of veneration for the cow was continued during this 
period. A long list of penances for killing or maiming a cow is 
given in the Madanapdrijdta (856-59), and a much shorter list in 
Sulapani’s commentary on Yajnavalkya (III, 263-64). We have a 
high eulogy of the cow in the Bnhaddharma Purdna (II, 6.31f). No 
wonder, therefore, that Sulapani (on Yajnavalkya, I, 109) and the 
Grihastharatndkara (294) specifically forbid the killing of cows in 
honour of guests (as laid down by Yajnavalkya and Vasishtha) on 
the ground of its inclusion in the Kalivarjya list of Brahma Purdna , 
The worship of the bull is mentioned as a peculiar Indian custom by 
Odoric and Jordanus in their accounts of Quilon and ‘India the Less’ 
respectively. The high respect paid to the cow by the inhabitants 
of Calicut is noticed by ‘Abd-ur-Razzaq. 14 

The sentiment of veneration for the cow is extended by the 
Smriti authorities to other animals as well. Sacrificing animals with 
recitations of the Vedic texts in honour of the bridegroom, the guests 
and the ancestors is included in the Kalivarjya texts which are 
quoted in the Pardsara-Madhava and the Madanapdrijdta. A long 
list of penances for killing different species of birds, rodents and 
quadrupeds is given in the Pardsara-Madhava (III 61-72). 

B. MUSLIM RELIGION AND SOCIETY 

The early history of Sufiism in India has been discussed above. 1 
The Khaljl period (1290-1320) saw a further intensification of the 
activities of this school, thanks mainly to the three great saints of the 
period, Hazrat Nizam-ud-dln Auliya of Delhi, his spiritual preceptor, 
Shaikh Farld-ud-dln Mas‘ud Ganj-i-Shakar of Ajodhan, and the 
latter’s nephew and disciple, ‘Ala-ud-dm Sabir of Piran Kalyar. The 
memory of these saintly personages and their successors is as fresh 
today as it was centuries ago, and their anniversaries (‘tirs, d c rds) are 
celebrated with as great eclat today as ever, when musicians and 
poets gather in thousands to pay the tribute of glowing praise to 
their miraculous lives and to enliven the huge concourses of the pil¬ 
grims to their shrines. The unbounded influence of the saints on 
the masses often roused the jealousy and suspicion of the rulers, but 
they carried on their mission quietly and peacefully, unruffled alike 
by the glamour of the royal court and the hostility of the kings. 


606 


MUSLIM RELIGION AND SOCIETY 


None of the latter, indeed, had the courage to molest them or to per¬ 
secute their followers openly, though some of them tried, ineffective¬ 
ly, to alienate popular sympathy from them, accusing them of dis¬ 
seminating heretical ideas and sheltering criminals in their monas¬ 
teries. 2 It is possible that occasionally these saints encouraged 
certain public risings and demonstrations against tyrannical rulers, 
but that they ever did so with any selfish motive can hardly be 
proved. On the other hand, their sole purpose in blessing such 
movements was the welfare of the common people. 

Besides these spiritual teachers, mention may also be made of 
another class of ascetics, the qcilandars, who did not usually found 
any orders or establish any spiritual centres, but wandered about, 
leading lives of seclusion, renunciation, and poverty, striving not so 
much for the spiritual and moral uplift of the common people, as for 
their own individual salvation. This attitude of aloofness, however, 
did not protect them against popular curiosity, and they were gene¬ 
rally held in high esteem and surrounded by admirers and devotees. 
They were usually clean-shaved, went about clad in woollen robes 
of coarse texture, and were not so particular about the observance 
of religious duties enjoined by Islam. Of these qalandars, the most 
celebrated was Bu ‘All of Panipat, a brother of Shaikh Jamai-ud-dm 
Hanswl who died about A.D. 1333. The cumulative effect of the 
presence in large number of such saints and ascetics was the trans¬ 
formation of Islam in India from a simple and puritanic religion, 
with emphasis on the performance of outward legal duties ( takalif-i - 
shar‘iya) to a complex, devotional creed in which miracles and 
superstitions, combined, of course, with saint-worship, played an 
important role. It became a common practice now to get oneself 
attached to a spiritual preceptor, who alone, according to the popular 
belief, could guarantee bliss and happiness in this life and the life 
hereafter. Dates of the anniversaries of the more famous saints used 
to be memorized with assiduous care, and in course of time the months 
of the lunar calendar, in which these dates fell, came to be known 
by their names. 3 A pious Muslim, especially among the uneducated 
classes, would rather miss the five ritual daily prayers and the obli¬ 
gatory fast of Ramazan than fail to make a suitable offering ( naydz ) 
on any of the important dates consecrated to the memory of a saint. 

The dissemination of Sufi ideas in India was continued during 
the Tughluq period by the disciples of Hazrat Nizam-ud-din Auliya, 
the most notable of whom was Shaikh Nasir-ud-din of Awadh known 
as Raushan Charagh (the Bright Lamp), who was killed by a qalan- 
dar in A.D. 1356 and lies buried near Delhi. 


607 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


As noted above, the Bhakti movement was very popular among 
the Hindus during the period when the Sufi movement gained 
strength in India. The two parallel movements, based upon doctrines 
of love and selfless devotion, helped a lot in bringing the two com¬ 
munities closer together, in spite of occasional reactionary move¬ 
ments, such as that started by the fanatical Sayyid Muhammad who 
claimed to be the Mahdi 4 . Sultan Sikandar Lodi apparently came 
under the influence of the orthodox ‘ulama and is said to have com¬ 
mitted certain acts of intolerance, to which reference has been made 
above . 5 

The Muslim society in the meantime was fast becoming 
Indianized. Below the Sultan, who was a despotic ruler with no 
limit or restraint on his powers except such as was dictated by con¬ 
siderations of a peaceful and stable government, there stood certain 
privileged classes, namely the umard or nobles and the ‘ulama or 
scholars, holding fiefs and estates. The slaves of the royal house¬ 
hold may also be regarded as a privileged class, for in spite of their 
morally degraded position, they were usually well cared for and 
often exercised considerable influence on their royal masters. This 
is clearly shown by the examples of Malik Kafur, the lieutenant of 
Sultan ‘Ala-ud-dm Khalji, and Malik Khusrav, the favourite of that 
monarch’s son, Qutb-ud-dm Mubarak Shah. There does not appear 
to have been any strong and prosperous middle class in those days, 
so that the wealth and splendour of the upper strata of society form¬ 
ed a strange contrast with the poverty and squalor of the masses, 
both Muslim and Hindu. The Muslim nobles were usually of foreign 
origin,—Persians, Turks, Afghans and Sayyids or Arabs,—and mostly 
kept themselves aloof from their Indian subjects and dependants. 
The arrogant aristocratic classes gradually developed a sort of caste 
system which was alien to the spirit of Islam and v/as certainly the 
product of Indian influences. Thus a Turk (or Mughul), a Pathan, 
a Sayyid, or even a Shaikh , 6 would never think of a matrimonial 
alliance with a person of a lower rank, that is one outside these four 
dhdts or qaums, or even outside his own particular denomination. 
The purdah or seclusion of women had already become a common 
practice. This is evident from the remarks made by contemporary 
historians and poets on the bold step taken by Sultana Raziyya in 
discarding the veil and dressing herself up in male attire. Khusrav, 
in the Matla ‘al Anwar and elsewhere, has addressed his “paradise- 
daughter” in the most loving words, but it is obvious from the bits 
of fatherly advice which he gives her, that he considers the woman’s 
right place to be her home, and her most sacred duty, obedience to 
her father or brother. This naturally led to the institution of the 
harem in the case of the more prosperous and respectable classes of 


60 S 


MUSLIM RELIGION AND SOCIETY 


Society. It must not, however, be supposed that polygamy or the 1 
keeping of concubines was a common practice. This sort of luxury 
could be afforded only by a privileged few. In most cases the harem 
was no more than a separate living quarter for the women-folk of 
the family, corresponding to the zanankhana, as opposed to the 
dlwdnkhana or the male quarters of a later period. Purdah was, 
however, unknown among the lower classes, specially in rural 
society. How far the adoption of the purdah of a rigid type by the 
Muslims in India was due to Rajput influence, it is difficult to deter¬ 
mine. What is certain is that the peculiar social conditions in India 
were largely responsible for the development of this system which 
was unknown in other Muslim countries in medieval times. 

Right from the kings and the nobles at the top down to the hum¬ 
blest citizens, the Muslims had become thoroughly Indianized. The 
costly royal dresses, the gilded and studded swords and daggers , 7 
the umbrellas ( chhatra ) of various colours, the richly caparisoned 
elephants which, as an emblem of royalty, were stationed in the dur¬ 
bar-hall and accompanied the state cavalcades, were all typi¬ 
cally Indian paraphernalia of royal pomp and splendour. The old 
Indian practice of chewing the betel-leaf had become very popular 
among the Muslims . 8 Khusrav, in his account of his maternal grand¬ 
father Tmad-ul-Mulk, speaks of continuous relays of this delicacy 
being brought to his assemblies in the diwtin-i- c arz, and distributed 
among those present there. The seasoning of food with rich spices 
and chillies, almost unknown in the Muslim lands, had also become 
widely prevalent; the culinary art brought by the Muslims to India 
had already absorbed several Indian elements. Standard dishes 
which, from their names, would appear to be of foreign origin, such 
as pilau and qawarma, were now very different from what they had 
been in Iran or Khurasan. The amazingly large range of dishes 
(aliodn ), indulged in by the wealthy or served on festive occasions , 9 
would clearly show how luxurious and refined had become the tastes 
of the well-to-do people, which could only be possible in a rich 
country like India. Among the articles of dress in common use, the 
head-gears known as the chira and the pdg were certainly of Indian 
origin and were borrowed from the Rajputs. They would appear 
to have been in vogue among the dandies of Delhi and other big 
cities . 10 The tight-fitting cloak for men and the tight-fitting 
trousers, often worn beneath a loose skirt, for women, on the other 
hand, were of foreign origin, and were adopted by the Rajputs from 
their Muslim neighbours. The use of rings, necklaces, ear-rings and 
other ornaments by men was also due to Indian influence, for such 
vanities were strictly forbidden to the faithful in the Islamic law. 
India was famous for its fine cotton and silk fabrics, which now 

609 


D.S.— 39 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


began to be widely used by the gentry among the Muslims who had 
been accustomed to much humbler and coarser stuffs in their original 
home-lands . 11 Textile industry flourished in several parts of India 
—the Deccan, Gujarat, Bengal, Bihar and Mysore,—under the patro¬ 
nage of the Muslim rulers. It is a significant fact that most of the 
weavers and master-craftsmen came to be, in the course of time, 
Muslims, who had either embraced Islam, or were of foreign origin 
and had brought with them some of their native traditions to India. 
The names of certain fabrics such as Susl or Daryd’i, would clearly 
show that the textile art, developed in Muslim countries, had been 
grafted on the Indian indigenous art, resulting in great improvement 
and development. 

The same admixture is prominently visible in other branches of 
useful and fine arts that flourished in the pre-Mughul period. The 
fine, massive edifices raised by the Khaljis, the Tughluqs, and the 
Sharql kings of Jaunpur, all betray Indian influence and are very 
dissimilar to those raised in contemporary times in other Muslim 
lands. lla The stone-carvers of India, who were mostly Hindus, 
were employed in large numbers in shaping the pillars and engrav¬ 
ing the floral and calligraphic motifs and designs in these buildings. 
The use of lintels instead of arches in some of them is also an indi¬ 
cation of the architectural synthesis that was brought about in this 
age. Painting was comparatively little developed in the Sultanate, 
due possibly to the religious ban on it. 

*The cultivation of music has always been a matter of contro¬ 
versy among the Muslims in India. There are two schools of Muslim 
jurists; one maintains that music has been prohibited, while many 
liberal thinkers claim that it has been permitted. An Arabo-Iranian 
music was already in vogue in the Muslim world before the eighth 
century A.D. Probably this influenced the Hindu music in Sind 
after the Muslims had conquered it, and Nauruz, Zangola, and Hejaz 
forms were incorporated by the Indians under the names of Nurc- 
choka, Jangla and Hejaj. 

*Khwaja Mufin-ud-din Chishtl’s band of qavvdls sang every 
evening. Illtutmish put a ban on music, but a member of the 
Chishti order, who had gone to Delhi, was able to persuade him to 
withdraw it. Since then musical soirees were organized for the 
durbars and people began to indulge in them publicly. The durbar 
of his son, Rukn-ud-dln Firuz, became a centre of celebrated musi¬ 
cians and dancers of both sexes. Balban was also a great patron of 
music. He has spoken of Indian music in the highest terms and 
regarded it as superior to the music of any other country. He is 
credited with the invention of several new melodies compounded 


610 


MUSLIM RELIGION AND SOCIETY 


of Iranian and Indian tunes. During Kaiqubad’s reign music be¬ 
came the order of the day, and both Jalal-ud-dln and ‘Ala-ud-dln 
Khalji were great patrons of music. 

* Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq banned music, but the ban was with¬ 
drawn by Muhammad Tughluq, and musical entertainment by 
both males and females is said to have been instituted for the royal 
durbar. He had twelve musicians in his regular service, besides 
one thousand slave musicians. Ibn Batutah refers to the popularity 
of music in the royal court. Firuz Tughluq, though orthodox, was 
not averse to music, and his accession to the throne was celebrated 
by entertaining the public for twenty-one days with music. A num¬ 
ber of books on music and dance, found at JvaiamukhI, were trans¬ 
lated into Persian at his instance. The Sayyid king Mubarak Shah 
was noted for his love of music . 12 

Music, both of secular as well as spiritual character, seems to 
have reached a high level of perfection, during the period under 
review. The contributions made by the Muslims to Indian music 
are generally recognized as of far-reaching consequence, and the 
devotional qavvati music, practised by skilled artists at the monas¬ 
teries of the dead or living saints, must have been a powerful factor 
in strengthening the bonds of unity between the two communities. 
It is this unity of culture which finds proud expression in the verses 
of Amir Khusrav, who pays glowing tributes to the manifold virtues 
of India, his birth-place. Similar tributes are scattered in the poems 
of other writers, like Amir Hasan Sijizi, Mutahhar of Karra and 
Jamali Kanboh. 

Among the religious ceremonies and social functions those of 
the ‘aqiqa , 13 the bismillcih , 14 the circumcision, the marriage, and 
the funeral played the most important part in the life of an individual, 
and in these also we can easily trace Indian influence. Several 
ceremonies, connected specially with marriage and death, were com¬ 
mon, as they are today, to both the communities , 15 although the 
Muslims, following the old Arab tradition, continued in India, as 
elsewhere, to marry cousins and other close relations. The Indian 
bridal decoration, the sola singhdr, had already become familiar to 
the Muslims, and is often mentioned by the name of “hojt-o-nuh” 
by Khusrav and others. Ibn Batutah’s account of the marriage of 
a Sayyid noble, Saif-ud-dm, with a sister of Sultan Muhammad 
Tughluq, provides a revealing picture of the great extent to which 
the Muslims had adopted the Hindu marriage ceremonies even in 
those early days. Ibn Batutah also gives an account of the funeral 
ceremonies in connection with the death of his daughter . 16 Among 
the religious ceremonies the hajj or the annual pilgrimage to Mecca 


611 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


was, of course, the most important, but pilgrimages to the shrines 
of famous saints were also very frequent, especially on the occasion 
of their urses or anniversaries. The close of the Ramazan fast, the 
Id-ul-Fitr, was another important occasion for general rejoicing, 
while the Shab-i-Barat, which has several common features with 
the Hindu festival of Sivaratri, was celebrated by keeping a night¬ 
long vigil and a noisy display of fire-works. Apart from these im¬ 
portant festivals more or less of Islamic origin, the Indian Muslims 
freely participated in the Hindu festivals of a religio-social charac¬ 
ter, such as the Basant, the Holi and the Diwali, which is clearly 
proved by contemporary historical evidence. 

The every-day humdrum life of the common people, devoid usu¬ 
ally of amusements or excitements, was frequently brightened up 
by the royal cavalcades, jashns (such as that of the nauruz ), and 
receptions, when the streets were lavishly decorated and beautiful 
kiosks or pavilions (qubhas) erected at regular intervals, in which 
there were stationed beautiful singing and dancing girls, and where 
the spectators were treated not only to music but also to pleasant 
drinks. Glowing accounts of these qubhas are found in the writings 
of Khusrav, Ibn Batutah and other writers . 17 

The game of chaugan (polo), riding, racing, hunting, and 
archery were very popular as outdoor sports among the nobility 
and the better classes of society, but the poorer people could seldom 
indulge in them. Among the indoor games, popular both among 
the rich and the poor, chess and backgammon (nard or chaupar) 
are often mentioned, although they were usually frowned upon by 
the religious divines as frivolous pursuits beguiling the faithful 
from more useful and more serious occupations. Drinking of wine, 
in spite of the strict ban placed on it by Islam, seems to have been 
very common, especially in the higher classes of society, and convi¬ 
vial wine parties supplied another source of recreation and amuse¬ 
ment. To what extent the habit had become prevalent, may be 
judged from what Barani says about ‘Ala-ud-din’s determination to 
root it out . 18 Huge quantities of the precious vintage were hunted 
out of the hidden cellars and poured out into the streets. Some of it 
was given to the royal elephants, which made even the pious histo¬ 
rian exclaim, not without a touch of envy: “How lucky were the 
elephants of that age to have thus enjoyed themselves.” ‘Ala-ud- 
dm’s stern measures against the use of wine and other corrupt 
practices, however, did not produce any lasting result, for in the 
reign of his son and successor, Qutb-ud-dln Mubarak Shah, the peo¬ 
ple, encouraged by the recklessly dissolute life of their monarch, 
again reverted to their old ways of life. Jesters, buffoons and 


612 


MUSLIM RELIGION AND SOCIETY 


mountebanks, who had already become a regular feature of society, 
had the time of their life under this profligate king, one of whose 
court jesters, Tamasha by name, used to walk right into the ranks 
of the nobles and divines assembled in the durbar-hall, in a state 
of inebriation and revile the greatest of them with impunity. Some 
of the later monarchs, like Firuz Tughluq, again took up the task of 
reform, but their efforts succeeded, if at all, for only brief periods. 

It must not, however, be supposed that the majority of the 
Indian Muslims of the Sultanate period were immoral or irreligious; 
for even among the nobles we often come across the names of some 
who were noted for their piety and abstemious lives . 19 Most of 
the common people, on the other hand, led exemplary moral lives 
and were deeply religious in their outlook. It is, indeed, a remark¬ 
able fact that the middle and lower classes of Muslim society in 
India have always remained free from the corrupting influence of 
the court, and staunchly loyal to the Islamic way of life as developed 
in the peculiar social and economic structure of India. The essen¬ 
tially religious mental attitude, which is a distinguishing feature 
of the Indian Muslims even today, has certainly been inherited from 
their forefathers who lived in the middle ages. Indian Islam is 
very different in some respects from the Arabian Islam of the 
Prophet’s days, but it is a powerful and practical moral and religious 
discipline which has enabled the Indian Muslims to preserve their 
unity and identity in this land of diverse cultures and religions. 

As we have remarked above, the nobles and other privileged 
classes among the Muslims held fiefs and estates or large revenue- 
assignments, which enabled them to lead lives of ease and prospe¬ 
rity. They had enough money to emulate their royal masters in 
their extravagantly generous expenditure on special occasions, such 
as feasts, festivals, marriages, etc. They lived in palatial houses 
with a large number of slaves and domestic servants, male and 
female. Their houses were usually provided with rich furnishings, 
richly decorated sofas and divans, exquisitely made glass and china, 
costly tapestries and valuable carpets from Persia and Bukhara, 
vases, and gold and silver dishes and bowls. Their stables were 
stocked with fine horses of indigenous and foreign breeds , 20 and 
many of them also kept elephants, so that a fil-khana was almost 
an essential part of a noble’s household. They were usually 
surrounded by a large number of dependants and hangers-on, and 
were lavish in their gifts to poets and scholars who basked in the 
sun-shine of their favour. Actually the house of each of these 
nobles was a miniature replica of the royal court, and it is not 
strange, therefore, that these nobles’ wealth and munificence occa- 


613 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


sionaliy excited the jealousy of the kings themselves. Hoarding of 
wealth was unknown, chiefly because all revenue assignments were 
personal and not hereditary, and could be cancelled even in the 
lifetime of the holder. 

Next to the nobles, there was a large class of people with modest 
incomes derived either from small land-holdings or from the royal 
treasury in return for their services in different capacities. These 
latter consisted of district officers, revenue collectors, judges, post¬ 
masters and others, some of whom were directly connected with the 
royal household as scribes and secretaries, or as tutors and teachers 
of the monarch’s children. Quite a few of them were also attached 
to the households of various nobles, and led, on the whole, fairly 
prosperous and happy lives, possessing their own houses in the cities 
and the villages. Their mainstay was their landed properties, small 
or large, and many of them were actively engaged in the cultivation 
of land. The arts of calligraphy and epistolography ( inshci ), which 
were assiduously cultivated by most of them, often provided remu¬ 
nerative sources of income. 

The lowest strata of Muslim society comprised the peasants and 
cultivators, usually of Indian origin, workmen, artisans, and domes¬ 
tic servants. Business and trade were mostly in the hands of Hindu 
merchants among whom the merchants of Gujarat (usually Banias) 
and Multan were famous for their large-scale mercantile activities 
and fabulous wealth, and their help was constantly sought by the 
spendthrift nobles and bourgeoisie who found themselves in difficul¬ 
ties. A large number of workmen and artisans—weavers, carpen¬ 
ters, metal-engravers, scribes, etc.—were usually attached to the 
royal ateliers or karkhdnas, while many more of them found employ¬ 
ment as retainers of the nobles and the grandees; but most of them 
worked independently, and following the old Indian practice, had 
formed themselves into guilds or trade unions. They usually occu¬ 
pied separate and well-marked quarters in the cities which were 
named after them, as the weavers’ market, the potters’ market, and 
so on. While it is difficult to have any exact idea of the wages earn¬ 
ed by these workmen, due to lack of reliable data, it would appear 
that they were fairly well off and could earn enough to keep them¬ 
selves and their families in tolerable comfort. This was chiefly 
because the essential commodities were cheap and plentiful, and 
they had not yet become used to such luxuries as became common in 
later times. According to a rough calculation based on information 
derived from contemporary sources, a modest monthly income of five 
tankas (silver coins) was sufficient for the maintenance of a small 
family consisting of five members . 21 On the whole, therefore, this 


614 


HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


class of people also suffered no particular economic hardship. Star¬ 
vation, unemployment and frustration were usually unknown, ex¬ 
cept, of course, during famines, which were rather too frequent, due 
to lack of adequate means of irrigation. 

To sum up this brief survey of the religious, intellectual and 
social condition of the Indian Muslims of the Sultanate period, we 
could make the following general observations: 

(1) The religion of Islam, at least its popular form, underwent 
substantial change, having been profoundly influenced by the Sufi 
beliefs, which, in their turn, owed a good deal to Hindu Vedantic 
and Yogic philosophy. The majority of the Muslims, in spite of the 
corrupt lives led by some of their kings and nobles, remained, on the 
whole, religious, and conformed scrupulously to the moral standards 
set up by Islam. 

(2) Intellectually, great progress was made in all fields of 
learning, and this age produced some of the greatest poets and 
scholars of Muslim India. Many literary products of this period 
have been irretrievably lost, but those which have survived occupy 
a place of very considerable importance in Arabic and Persian liter¬ 
ature produced in India. 22 

(3) Socially, the Muslims of foreign extraction, who came to 
India from Persia, Afghanistan and Khurasan, in the early days, un¬ 
like the Arabs, held themselves aloof from the Indians for some time, 
but gradually the barriers between the two communities were re¬ 
moved, and a process of Indianization started, making rapid advance 
and reaching its climax during the Mughul period. The manifesta¬ 
tions of this process were visible in every walk of life, and the 
Muslims had already adopt many habits, ways and manners of the 
Hindus. 


C. HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 

Reference has been made above 1 to the uncompromising spirit 
of animosity between the Hindus and the Muslims in India in the 
thirteenth century A.D. It is necessary to review the changes, if 
any, that took place in their mutual relation during the period of two 
centuries and a quarter (1300-1526) covered by this volume. 

1. Influence of one community upon another 

The Muslims made a large number of converts in India and, by 
the end of the period, the vast majority of Indian Muslims must have 
been descendants of Hindu converts. la Even the Muslims who 
claimed descent from foreigners or foreign immigrants into India 
lived as close neighbours to the Hindus for generations. It was 


615 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


inevitable, therefore, that there must have been some reciprocal in¬ 
fluence between the two communities. Sufficient data are not avail¬ 
able for an exact determination of such influence, but it is possible 
to have a general idea. It has been pointed out in the preceding 
section that many social practices of Indian Muslims, such as marriage 
and class distinction, and some of their ideas and beliefs which differ 
materially from those of their co-religionists elsewhere, were pro¬ 
bably due to the influence of the Hindu society. As regards dress, 
food, language, music, art and architecture, each influenced the other 
to a certain extent, at least in some regions, mostly in North India. 

Even in religious matters there was some mutual influence, as 
is indicated by Sufiism on the one hand, and the doctrines of medieval 
Hindu saints on the other, to which detailed reference has been made 
in Ch. XVI. Muslim saints, particularly of the mystic school, were 
revered by the Hindus, though, be it noted, the Hindus would not 
admit them in their houses nor give them food or water in their own 
utensils. 2 The Hindu mendicants, yogis, and astrologers were held 
in high respect by the Muslims. Some local cults, like those of 
Satyaplr (True Saint), were popular with village-folks of both the 
communities. Even in some minor matters, such as the auspicious 
day for commencing a journey, the Muslims adopted the customs of 
the Hindus. 3 

In the field of scholarship and literature there was some amount 
of sympathetic understanding between the two communities. The 
Muslim scholars studied Hindu philosophy and sciences, such as the 
systems of Yoga and Vedanta, medicine, and astrology, while the 
Hindus learnt from them subjects like geography, arithmetic and 
chemistry, in which the Arabs had made striking progress. Some 
Muslim rulers were patrons of Hindu writers, and a few Muslim 
scholars wrote in Indian vernaculars. A few Hindus also wrote in 
Persian. The mutual linguistic influence was reflected in the change 
of Hindi on a line which ultimately led to the development of Urdu. 

But all these touched merely the fringe and external elements 
of life, and even as such, their influence was confined to a small sec¬ 
tion of the Hindus and Muslims of India, taken as a whole. It is 
noteworthy, that neither the Hindus nor the Muslims imbibed, even 
to the least degree, the chief characteristic features of the other’s 
culture which may be regarded as their greatest contribution to 
human civilization. The ultra-democratic social ideas of the 
Muslims, though strictly confined to their own religious community, 
were an object-lesson of equality and fraternity which Europe, and 
through her the world, learnt at a great cost only in the nineteenth 
century. The liberal spirit of toleration and reverence for all reli- 


616 


HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


gions, preached and practised by the Hindus, is still an ideal and 
despair of the civilized mankind. The Hindus, even with the living 
example of the Muslim community before their very eyes, did not 
relax in the least their social rigidity and inequality of men exem¬ 
plified in the caste-system and untouchability. Nor did the Muslims 
ever moderate their zeal to destroy ruthlessly the Hindu temples and 
images of gods, and their attitude in this respect remained unchanged 
from the day when Muhammad bin Oasim set foot on the soil of 
India till the eighteenth century A.D. when they lost all political 
power. The Hindus combined catholicity in religious outlook with 
bigotry in social ethics, while the Muslims displayed an equal bigotry 
in religious ideas with catholicity in social behaviour. 

As will be shown later, there was no rapprochement in respect 
of popular or national traditions, and those social and religious ideas, 
beliefs, practices, and institutions which touch the deeper chord of 
life and give it a distinctive form, tone, and vigour. In short, the 
reciprocal influences were too superficial in character to affect mate¬ 
rially the fundamental differences between the two communities in 
respect of almost every thing that is deep-seated in human nature 
and makes life worth living. So the two great communities, al¬ 
though they lived side by side, moved each in its own orbit, and 
there was as yet no sign that the “twain shall ever meet”. 

2. Status of the Hindus 

The political and religious condition under which the Hindus 
were forced to live in a Muslim State raised a great barrier between 
the two communities. The political supremacy of the Muslims was 
absolute; the Hindus not only enjoyed no political status in practice, 
but could not even aspire to it under Islamic theory. This has been 
lucidly expressed by Sir Jadunath Sarkar, an eminent historian of 
international reputation, in an article from which the following 
passage is quoted: 

“The poison lay in the very core of Islamic theocracy. Under 
it there can be only one faith, one people, and one all overriding 
authority. The State is a religious trust administered solely by His 
people (the Faithful) acting in obedience to the Commander of the 
Faithful, who was in theory, and very often in practice too, the 
supreme General of the Army of militant Islam ( Janud ). There 
could be no place for non-believers. Even Jews and Christians could 
not be full citizens of it, though they somewhat approached the 
Muslims by reason of their being “People of the Book” or believers 
in the Bible, which the Prophet of Islam accepted as revealed. 


617 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


“As for the Hindus and Zoroastrians, they had no place in such 
a political system. If their existence was tolerated, it was only to 
use them as hewers of wood and drawers of water, as tax-payers, 
“Khiraj-guzar”, for the benefit of the dominant sect of the Faithful. 
They were called Zimmis or people under a contract of protection 
by the Muslim State on condition of certain service to be rendered 
by them and certain political and civil disabilities to be borne by 
them to prevent them from growing strong. The very term Zimmi 
is an insulting title. It connotes political inferiority and helpless¬ 
ness like the status of a minor proprietor perpetually under a guar¬ 
dian; such protected people could not claim equality with the citizens 
of the Muslim theocracy. 

“Thus by the basic conception of the Muslim State all 
non-Muslims are its enemies, and it is the interest of the State 
to curb their growth in number and power. The ideal aim was 
to exterminate them totally, as Hindus, Zoroastrians and Christian 
nationals have been liquidated (sometimes totally, sometimes leaving 
a negligible remnant behind) in Afghanistan, Persia and the Near 
East. 

“The Quran (IX.29) calls upon the Muslims ‘to fight those who 
do not profess the true faith, till they pay jizya with the hand in 
humality (ham sagkhirun )This was a poll-tax payable by Hindus 
(and also Christians) for permission to live in their ancestral homes 
under a Muslim sovereign. 

“In addition to the obligation to pay this poll-tax, the Hindu 
was subjected to many disabilities by the very constitution of the 
Muslim theocracy. He must distinguish himself from the Muslims by 
wearing a humble dress, and sometimes adding a label of a certain 
colour to his coat. He must not ride on horse-back or carry arms, 
though wearing the sword was a necessary part of the dress of every 
gentleman of that age. He must show a generally respectful at¬ 
titude towards Muslims. The Hindu was also under certain legal 
disabilities in giving testimony in law-courts, protection under the 
criminal law, and in marriage. Finally, in the exercise of his religion 
he must avoid any publicity that may rouse the wrath of the 
followers of the Prophet. 

“Under the Canon Law, as followed in Islamic countries, a man 
who converts a Muslim to some other faith is liable to death at 
the hands of any private Muslim, and so also is the apostate from 
Islam.” 4 

Sir Jadunath’s exposition of the Islamic theory, and in particu¬ 
lar his view of the nature of the jizya, has been opposed by some. 5 


618 


HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


But his views are fully borne out by the following passage in the 

Zakhlrat-ul-Muluk bv Shaikh Hamadani: 

%/ 

“There is another mandate relating to those subjects who are 
unbelievers and protected people {zimmis). For their governance, 
the observance of those conditions which the Caliph ‘Umar laid in 
his agreement for establishing the status of the fire-worshippers and 
the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and which gave them 
safety is obligatory on rulers and governors. Rulers should impose 
these conditions on the zimmis of their dominions and make their 
lives and their property dependent on their fulfilment. The twenty 
conditions are as follows: 

1. In a country under the authority of a Muslim ruler, they 
are to build no new homes for images or idol temples. 

2. They are not to rebuild any old buildings which have been 
destroyed. 

3. Muslim travellers are not to be prevented from staying in 
idol temples. 

4. No Muslim who stays in their houses will commit a sin if 
he is a guest for three days, if he should have occasion for the delay. 

5. Infidels may not act as spies or give aid and comfort to 
them. 

6. If any of their people show any inclination towards Islam, 
they are not to be prevented from doing so. 

7. Muslims are to be respected. 

8. If the zimmis are gathered together in a meeting and 
Muslims appear, they are to be allowed at the meeting. 

9. They are not to dress like Muslims. 

10. They are not to give each other Muslim names. 

11. They are not to ride on horses with saddle and bridle. 

12. They are not to possess swords and arrows. 

13. They are not to wear signet rings and seals on their 
fingers. 

14. They are not to sell and drink intoxicating liquor openly. 

15. They must not abandon the clothing which they have had 
as a sign of their state of ignorance so that they may be distinguished 
from Muslims. 

16. They are not to propagate the customs and usages of poly¬ 
theists among Muslims. 

17. They are not to build their homes in the neighbourhood 
of those of Muslims. 

18. They are not to bring their dead near the graveyards of 
Muslims. 

19. They are not to mourn their dead with loud voices. 

20. They are not to buy Muslim slaves. 


610 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


At the end of the treaty it is written that if zimmis infringe any 
of these conditions, they shall not enjoy security and it shall be 
lawful for Muslims to take their lives and possessions as though they 
were the lives and possessions of unbelievers in a state of war with 
the faithful” 53 

It is unnecessary for our present purpose to enter into any 
further discussion about the correctness of Sir Jadunath’s interpre¬ 
tation of the Muslim scripture, but there is no doubt that he correctly 
represents the view accepted, both in theory and practice, by the 
Muslim rulers and theologians in India during the period under 
review. 6 And this is really more relevant to the present issue. 

Reference has already been made above 7 to the position of the 
Hindus in Muslim State according to Islamic theory as explained 
by the ‘wise men’, and particularly Qazi Mughls-ud-dm of Bay-ana, to 
‘Ala-ud-din Khaljl, and the earnestness with which the Sultan 
carried it into practice. 

Muhammad bin Tughluq is generally, and perhaps rightly, re¬ 
garded as a man of liberal views. The Chinese Emperor asked for 
his permission to build a temple at Samhal, a place of pilgrimage 
in the Himalayan hills frequented by the Chinese, which the Muslim 
army “had seized, destroyed and sacked”. But the Sultan, who 
accepted the rich presents sent by the Chinese Emperor, wrote to 
him a reply to this effect: “Islam does not allow the furthering of 
such an aim and the permission to build a temple in a Muslim country 
can be accorded only to those who pay the jizya .” 8 

It has been already stated above, that Firuz Tughluq, who also 
looked upon India as a Muslim country, held more bigoted views, 
for he would not permit the erection of new temples even by those 
who paid the jizya. He, however, realized this tax with utmost 
rigour even from the Brahmans who were up to that time exempted 
from it. 9 

The true nature of the jizya is further revealed by the opposi¬ 
tion of the orthodox Muslims to the idea that the Hindus should 
be allowed to perform their religious ceremonies simply by the 
payment of the jizya. The historian Ziya-ud-dm Baranl, a contem¬ 
porary of the two Tughluq emperors, mentioned above, wrote in 
righteous indignation: 

“.Should the kings consider the payment of a few tan¬ 

kas by way of jizya as sufficient justification for their allowing all 
possible freedom to the infidels to observe and demonstrate all orders 
and details of infidelity, to read the misleading literature of their 
faith and to propagate their teachings, how could the true religion 


620 


HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


get the upper hand over other religions and how could the emblems 
of Islam be held high. . . ” 10 

It would thus appear that an orthodox section of the Muslims 
chafed at the Hanafite doctrine which was officially accepted by 
the Muslim rulers in India. As QazI Mughls-ud-dln pointed out to 
‘Ala-ud-din Khaljl, ‘it was Hanifa alone who assented to the impo¬ 
sition of the jizya on the Hindus. Doctors of other schools allow 
no other alternative but ‘Death or Islam’. As has been stated 
above, 11 Sultan Mahmud followed this policy, and evidently BaranI 
and men of his ilk yearned for its restoration in the fourteenth 
century. BaranI gave vent to this feeling in the following passage 
in his Fatawd-i-Jahanddrl.: “If Mahmud .... had gone to India once 
more, he would have brought under his sword all the Brahmans of 
Hind who, in that vast land, are the cause of the continuance of the 
laws of infidelity and of the strength of idolators, he would have cut 
off the heads of two hundred or three hundred thousand Hindu chiefs. 
He would not have returned his “Hindu-slaughtering” sword to its 
scabbard until the whole of Hind had accepted Islam. For Mahmud 
was a Shaffiite, and according to Imam Shafi‘i the decree for Hindus 
is “either death or Islam”—that is to say, they should either be put 
to death or embrace Islam. It is not lawful to accept jizya from 
Hindus as they have neither a prophet nor a revealed book.” The 
same book shows how BaranI chafed at the idea that the “desire for 
the overthrow of infidels and the abasing of idolators and polytheists 
does not fill the hearts of the Muslim kings”, who “permit the banners 
of infidelity to be openly displayed in their capital and in the cities 
of Muslims, idols to be openly worshipped ...”. “How”, asks the 
indignant historian, “will the true faith prevail if rulers allow the 
infidels to keep their temples, adorn their idols, and to make merry 
during their festivals with beating of drums and dhols, singing and 
dancing?” lla 

If a learned historian and a distinguished Muslim felt no scruple 
in openly expressing such views in writing, in the fourteenth century 
A.D., i.e. six hundred years after the Muslims first settled in India, 
one can well understand why the gulf between the Hindus and the 
Muslims could never be bridged. 

A perusal of the history of ‘Aflf, another great historian of the 
period, conveys the same lesson. He puts in the mouth of the 
wazir of FIruz Tughluq a long speech in which he frankly says that 
a State should have only two ends in view, namely (1) prosperity 
of the kingdom and protection of the people, etc.; and (2) destruc¬ 
tion of the infidels and expansion of the kingdom. Then he adds 


621 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


with equal candour: “.through God’s grace the destruction of 

the infidels has achieved remarkable success.” 12 

Yahya, the historian of the fifteenth century, mentions a minor 
incident of etiquette which perhaps even more strikingly illustrates 
the fundamental difference between a Muslim and a Hindu ruler. 
When Ghiyas-ud-dln Balban proceeded to Bengal to chastise the 
rebellious Tughril, he sought to enter into an alliance with the 
Hindu king of Eastern Bengal, Rai Danuj. An interview between 
the two was arranged. It was customary for a king to stand up to 
receive a royal guest. But, Yahya comments, “the fact that a 
Muslim king ought not to show proper respect to an infidel made 
the Sultan pensive”. A wily minister suggested a way out of the 
difficulty. The Sultan sat on the throne with a falcon on his hand, 
and on the approach of Rai Danuj stood up and let the falcon go, sc 
that the people would surmise that he left the throne only to set 
the bird in motion. The Muslim honour was saved by playing 
a trick upon the unsuspecting Hindu king. 13 

The fact that such an incident was remembered and recorded, 
nearly two hundred years later, by an eminent Muslim historian, 
speaks volumes about the way in which a Muslim Sultan was apt 
to regard even an independent Hindu king, not to speak of lesser 
potentates or individuals. 

It would be tedious to multiply instances of this kind, many of 
which will be found in the famous historical chronicle of Firishta, 
while dealing with the history of the period under review. 

It is little wonder then that, as the history of the Muslim 
States in Medieval India clearly shows, the Hindus had hardly any 
place in the highest branches of administration or in the formula¬ 
tion of its policy. With a few exceptions, 14 here and there, almost 
all the high offices were bestowed upon the Muslims, whether Indian 
or foreign. It is interesting to note that many Muslim noblemen 
or adventurers, coming from Iran or Turan, were immediately ap¬ 
pointed to posts of honour, dignity and importance in a Muslim 
court, which were practically barred to the Hindus. The Bahmani 
court was, for long, the scene of rivalry between the foreign and the 
indigenous Muslim, 14a but the Hindus had no place there. The 
Muslim politicians and writers of the period took for granted that 
the natural distinction was between Muslims and Hindus, and not 
between Indians and foreigners. The State and society were divided 
horizontally and not vertically. 

As may be easily imagined, the Hindu attitude towards the 
Muslims was one of sullen bitterness. The Hindus resented the 


622 


HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


Muslim conquest of India and wistfully looked for the day when 
the name Aryavarta, the land of the Aryas, as appellation of their 
country, would once more be justified by the extermination of the 
mlechchhas (Muslims). The Hindus also looked upon their fellow- 
religionists in other parts of India as dearer and nearer to them 
than their Muslim neighbours. The Hindu rulers were also chary 
in appointing Muslims to high offices or admitting them in their 
counsels. There were, no doubt, exceptions, which prove the rule, 
and so far as recorded evidence goes, the Hindus were perhaps a 
little more liberal in this respect. But, in general, the kafirs and 
the mlechchhas stood as far apart in politics as the poles, as there 
could not possibly have been any common ground between the two 
in respect of political feelings and sentiments or historical traditions 
and ideals. Muhammad Tughluq and Flruz Tughluq spoke the bare 
truth when they publicly declared that the Sultanate of Delhi was 
a Muslim State, and all the Muslim rulers of the period under review 
consciously or unconsciously followed this principle in formulating 
their policy and principles of administration. This alone can satis¬ 
factorily explain why even Muslim rulers, otherwise liberal and 
fair-minded, did not scruple to follow an extremely bigoted religious 
policy, even though it wounded the most cherished and sacred senti¬ 
ments of their Hindu subjects. It is true that the Hindus occupied 
a large number of junior posts and, towards the close of the period, 
occasionally a few high offices, in civil administration, and more 
rarely, in the army. But they had no political status and lived on 
sufferance in the land of their birth, which was regarded as, and 
publicly declared to be, a Muslim State and country. The Hindus 
could, therefore, be hardly expected to be even as much satisfied 
with their political condition as the Hindus and Muslims at the be¬ 
ginning of the twentieth century when they held the offices even 
of governors and members of Viceroy’s council under the British 
rule. Whether we look at the intrinsic importance of the posts, or 
the number of them filled up by the subject people, the Hindus were 
in much worse condition after three hundred years of Muslim rule 
than the Indians after one hundred and fifty years of British supre¬ 
macy. Judged by a similar standard, the patronage and cultivation 
of Hindu learning by the Muslims, or their contribution to the deve¬ 
lopment of Hindu culture during their rule of three hundred years, 
pale into insignificance when compared with the achievements of 
the British rule during half that period in the same direction. It 
is only by instituting such comparison that we can make an objec¬ 
tive study of the condition of the Hindus under Muslim rule, and 
view it in its true perspective. 



THE DELHI SULTANATE 


3. Social and religious differences' 

While the political status of the Hindus was not such as to 
inspire their love or goodwill towards the Muslims, the social and 
religious differences were so acute and fundamental that they raised 
a Chinese wall between the two communities; even seven hundred 
years of close residence (including two of common servitude) have 
failed to make the least crack in that solid and massive structure, 
far less demolish it. 

In different stages in the history of a people’s evolution, they 
lay special emphasis on certain aspects of life which they hold more 
dear and sacred than anything else, and on which they place the 
greatest value. In the age of which we are speaking, religious and 
social institutions were the most cherished objects of life, of both 
Muslims and Hindus, and they attached even much more value to 
them than their descendants put upon political status and economic 
Welfare in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. And it is precisely 
in those two highly prized aspects of life that they differed funda¬ 
mentally from each other. 

Religion, which formed the very basis of culture and the key¬ 
note of life, both among the Muslims and the Hindus, kept them 
apart like the two poles. They differed fundamentally in their 
theological conception, method of worship, and everything connect¬ 
ed with daily devotion to God. To the Hindus, images and temples 
were the most sacred objects, but both of these were anathema to 
the Muslims. Their philosophical notions and sacred literature, their 
conception of heaven and hell, of this life and the next, in short the 
whole outlook on men and things lacked a common basis. 

There was a similar contrast between their social rules and re¬ 
gulations which were indissolubly connected with religion. The 
democratic ideas of the Muslims, leading to a wonderful equality 
among the brothers-in-faith, offered a strange contrast to the caste- 
system and untouchability of the Hindus. The Hindu ideas of 
physical purity differed from those of the Muslims. In social life 
there was absolute prohibition of intercourse by means of inter¬ 
marriage or interdining, and their practices and rituals had little in 
common. Coming down to concrete details we find that these two 
lived almost in two different worlds. The Muslims relished beef 
which was extremely abhorrent to the Hindus. The absence of mar¬ 
riage restriction within certain degrees of consanguinity and of rigid 
widowhood, as well as easy methods of divorce and remarriage of 
females among the Muslims, were repugnant to the Hindus. The 
laws of succession, disposal of the dead, and modes of eating and 
greeting were different. The Muslims assumed Arabic names, used 

024 


HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 

Arabic calendar of lunar months, and adopted distinctive dresses. 
Their congregational prayers were radically different from Hindu 
mode of worship, and music, which was an essential part of Hindu 
religious ceremonials, was usually forbidden within the precincts, 
or even in the neighbourhood, of mosques. The intellectual inspiration 
of the one was supplied by Arabic and Persian, and of the other by 
Sanskrit literature. The fact that the Muslims turned towards the 
west and the Hindus towards the east, while offering prayers or 
worship to God, though by itself of no great significance, very cor¬ 
rectly symbolized the orientation of the two cultures. 

4. Historical traditions 

In addition to social and religious differences, the historical 
traditions of the preceding centuries drove a wedge between the 
two communities and kept them apart. The Muslims naturally look¬ 
ed with pride and glory upon their successive military triumphs 
which laid the Hindus low and made them masters of the country. 
But no Hindu could possibly recollect them without a sense of shame 
and humiliation. The wilful destruction of images and temples 
which the Muslims, perhaps naturally and justly, looked upon as a 
glory of Islam, outraged the most cherished and deep-rooted senti¬ 
ments of the Hindus. The massacre and enslavement of the Hindus 
on a massive scale, generally following upon the victorious cam¬ 
paigns of the Muslims, to which Muslim chroniclers refer with glee, 
wounded the noblest and most tender feelings and left a lasting scar 
upon the memory of generations of Hindus. 

It would be idle to deny the fact that the spirit with which the 
military campaigns were undertaken was often as much political as 
religious, i.e. anti-Hindu. The following extract from the Tarikh-i- 
Wassdf, written at the beginning of the period under review, is a 
good illustration of this view. Referring to ‘Ala-ud-din KhaljTs 
campaign in Gujarat, the author writes: 

“The vein of the zeal of religion beat high for the subjection 

of infidelity and destruction of idols.With a view to holy 

war, and not for the lust of conquest, he enlisted.about 14,000 

cavalry and 20,000 infantry . . . The Muhammadan forces began to 
kill and slaughter, on the right and on the left unmercifully, through¬ 
out the impure land, for the sake of Islam, and blood flowed in 
torrents. 

“They took captive a great number of handsome and elegant 
maidens, amounting to 20,000, and children of both sexes, more than 

pen can enumerate. In short, the Muhammadan army brought 

the country to utter ruin, and destroyed the lives of the inhabitants, 

625 


D. S.—40 





THE DELHI SULTANATE 


and plundered the cities, and captured their offsprings, so that 
many temples were deserted and the idols were broken and 
trodden under foot, the largest of which was one called Somnat. 

.The fragments were conveyed to Delhi, and the entrance 

of the Jami’ Masjid was paved with them, that people might re¬ 
member and talk of this brilliant victory.... ‘Praise be to God, the 
Lord of the Worlds 15 ’ 

It is not strictly relevant to our present purpose to discuss how 
far the details of the campaign and the motive behind it have been 
correctly described by Wassaf. If a Muslim writer or chronicler 
could take this view of things in a serious historical narrative, it is 
beyond question that the Hindus would exaggerate, and paint in 
a still darker colour, both the inhuman cruelties and the bigoted 
religious zeal which prompted them. The effect of such an exulting 
description, by a member of the community which inflicted the in¬ 
jury, upon those that suffered it, can easily be imagined. 

The picture drawn by Wassaf belongs to the very beginning of 
the period under review. To the end of it reigned Sikandar Lodi, 
of whom another Muslim writer says: 

“He was so zealous a Musulman that he utterly destroyed diverse 
places of worship of the infidels, and left not a vestige remaining 
of them. He entirely ruined the shrines of Mathura, the mine of 
heathenism, and turned their principal Hindu places of worship into 
caravanserais and colleges. Their stone images were given to the 
butchers to serve them as meat-weights, and all the Hindus in 
Mathura were strictly prohibited from shaving their heads and 
beards, and performing their ablutions. He thus put an end to all 
the idolatrous rites of the infidels there; and no Hindu, if he wished 
to have his head or beard shaved, could get a barber to do it. Every 
city thus conformed as he desired to the customs of Islam.” 16 

Such instances can be easily multiplied. Indeed a perusal of 
the Muslim chronicles leaves no doubt that not only scenes like this 
were witnessed during the period, but were regarded as just and 
natural by the Muslim divines and learned men of the age. The 
blood-curdling tales of wholesale rapine and massacre of the Hindus 
by Muslims, narrated in a single chronicle like that of Firishta, would 
make one’s flesh creep. The Hindus, who must have looked upon 
such misdeeds as the most heinous crime and the greatest outrage 
on their religion and society, could hardly be expected to forget 
or forgive the sacrileges perpetrated in the name of Islam. They 
would be either more or less than human beings if they could do so. 
They paid the Muslims back in their own coins, but their opportuni¬ 
ties were naturally few and far between. 17 In any case, such recorded 


626 



HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


historical incidents are few, and contrary instances of religious tole¬ 
ration are by no means rare. The ferocity of Muslim bigotry, re¬ 
newed at intervals and therefore always of recent memory, fed 
the ulcer that was eating into vitals of communal amity. No wonder, 
it created a river of blood between the two communities which 
centuries of residence together could not bridge. 

5. Facts of History 

All these are by no means imaginary pictures or mere theoreti¬ 
cal deductions. They are fully supported by such positive evidence 
as we possess regarding the relation between the Hindus and the 
Muslims during the period under review. 

(a) Ihn Batutah 

We may begin with the picture drawn by Ibn Batutah, a learned 
Muslim of Africa, who travelled widely throughout India about the 
middle of the fourteenth century A.D. during the reign of Muham¬ 
mad bin Tughluq, one of the most enlightened and liberal-minded 
Sultans in India. 

Ibn Batutah confirms the general statement, made above, parti¬ 
cularly about forcible conversion, mass-enslavement, and the inferior 
status of the Hindus as zimmis . 18 Thus he remarks that “other 
nations embraced Islam only when the Arabs used their swords 
against them” (p. 128). 19 There are several references to Hindu 
female captives of the highest rank being accorded the most humi¬ 
liating treatment. Referring to the ‘id ceremony at Delhi in the 
Sultan’s palace he says: “Then enter the musicians, the first batch 
being the daughters of the infidel rajas—Hindus—captured in war 
that year. They sing and dance, and the Sultan gives them away 
to the amirs and a c izza. Then come the other daughters of the 
infidels who sing and dance; and the Sultan gives them away to his 
brothers, his relations, his brothers-in-law and the maliks’ sons” 
(p. 63). Again, Ibn Batutah casually observes: “At that time there 
arrived in Delhi some female infidel captives, ten of whom the vezir 
sent to me. I gave one of these to the man who brought them to 
me, but he was not satisfied. My companions took three young 
girls, and I do not know what happened to the rest” (p. 123). The 
presents sent by Muhammad bin Tughluq to the Emperor of China 
included “one hundred male slaves and one hundred slave song¬ 
stresses and dancers from among the Indian infidels” (p. 151). 

The position of the Hindus as zimmis is occasionally referred 
to by Ibn Batutah. “The inhabitants of Habanq”, says he, “are 
infidels under protection ( zimma ) from whom half of the crops 


627 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


which they produce is taken; besides they have to perform certain 
duties” (p. 241). He refers more than once to actual fights between 
infidel Hindus and their Muslim neighbours. Most interesting and 
instructive are the details connected with Alapur, a small city, most 
of whose inhabitants were infidels under protection (zimrriT). The 
commandant of this place “was one of those heroes, whose bravery 
was proverbial. Ceaselessly and quite alone he would fall upon 
the infidels and would kill them or take them prisoner, so much so 
that his reputation spread widely and he made a name for himself 
and the infidels feared him”. One day he fell upon a Hindu village 
and was killed in course of the fray. But his slaves seized the vil¬ 
lage. “They put its male population to the sword and made the 
womenfolk prisoner and seized everything in it”. Later, the Hindus 
avenged the insult by killing his son (p. 162-63). Immediately after 
narrating this, Ibn Batutah mentions an incident which shows the 
precarious tenure of a Hindu life. When he visited Gwalior he 
went to see the commandant who “was going to cut an infidel into 
two halves”. At Ibn Batutah’s request the life of the infidel was 
saved (p. 163). 

Ibn Batutah’s graphic account of the barbarous, almost incre¬ 
dible, cruelties perpetrated on the Hindus by the Sultan of Ma‘bar 
has been quoted above. 20 Ibn Batutah was a near relative of the 
Sultan and lived in his court. There is, therefore, no reason to dis¬ 
credit the story, incredibly horrible though it might appear to us, 
as it did to Ibn Batutah. He has also cited other instances of cruelty 
inflicted upon the Hindus by the same Sultan in the most callous 
manner. One day while Ibn Batutah was taking his meals with the 
{Sultan a Hindu (infidel) “was brought in along with his wife and 
their son who was seven years of age. The Sultan beckoned the 
executioners ordering them to cut off the Hindu’s (infidel’s) head”, 20a 
and then uttered some words meaning “and his wife and son”. Ibn 
Batutah turned away his eyes while this was being done. Another 
day the Sultan ordered the hands and feet of a Hindu to be cut 
off. Ibn Batutah left the place on pretence of saying prayers, and 
when he returned he found the unfortunate Hindu weltering in 
blood (p. 228). Ibn Batutah’s attitude on both the occasions does 
credit to him and definitely goes against those who excuse the con¬ 
duct of the Muslim Sultans on the ground that such cruelties were 
common in those days. 

Ibn Batutah bears witness to the deliberate and perpetual out¬ 
rage on Hindu religious sentiments, perpetrated by Muslim rulers 
and people. In the capital city of Delhi itself, he found near the 
eastern gateway of the famous Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque “two very 


628 


HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


big idols of copper connected together by stones. Every one who 
comes in and goes out of the mosque treads over them” (p. 27). 

Some random observations of Ibn Batutah seem to indicate that 
the Hindu and Muslims lived as entirely separate communities. 
Thus he remarks: “In India the infidels occupy one continuous piece 
of land and inhabit regions which are adjacent to those of the 
Muslims. The Muslims dominate the infidels” (p. 124). Reference 
is made to Parwan as “a small city of Musalmans lying in the midst 
of the territories of the infidels” (p. 163). In the capital city of a 
Hindu State in Malabar coast, “there are about four thousand 
Muslims, who inhabit a suburb of their own inside the jurisdiction 
of the city. There is fighting between them and the inhabitants 
of the city often” (p. 185). Ibn Batutah’s narrative shows that such 
communal fights were by no means rare. In another city of the 
Malabar coast “there were three Muslim quarters” (p. 188). When 
the Muslim Sultan of Hinawar conquered the Hindu city of Goa, 
he occupied the Hindu palace and gave the adjacent quarters to his 
followers, while ten thousand Hindu prisoners were removed to a 
suburb (p. 196). 

The segregation of the Muslim community was rendered neces¬ 
sary, at least to a large extent, by the social rules and habits of the 
Hindus who regarded the Muslims as unclean and impure 
(mlechchhas ). The Hindus maintained no social intercourse with 
the other community by way of interdining and intermarriage. They 
were uncompromising in this respect, and regarded the touch of 
Muslims, or even a scent of their food, as pollution. Ibn Batutah 
keenly felt all this when he passed through the Hindu States of 
Malabar, where Muslims were few and far between. He justly com¬ 
plains that no Hindu would give a vessel to a Muslim for drinking 
water of a well as he would do to another Hindu. “If one happens 
to be a Muslim he (Hindu) pours water into his (Muslim’s) hands 
and leaves off when the latter makes him a sign or withdraws. It 
is the custom among the heathens in the Malabar country that no 
Muslim should enter their houses or use their vessels for eating 
purposes. If a Muslim is fed out of their vessels, they either break 
the vessels, or give them away to the Musalmans” (p. 182). These 
Hindu ideas of untouchability concerning the Muslims were not con¬ 
fined to Malabar, but extended all over India, and Ibn Batutah 
draw T s a refreshing contrast in this respect between the infidels of 
Ceylon and those of India. The infidels of Ceylon, we are told, were 
unlike the infidels of India who would neither admit even Muslim 
fakirs in their houses nor give them food and water in their own 
utensils (p. xxxiv). Then he observes in a reminiscent mood: 


029 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


“Occasionally we were compelled to ask some of the infidels of India 
to cook meat for us. They used to bring it in their own cooking pots 
and to sit at a little distance from us; they used to bring also leaves 
of banana tree upon which they placed rice—their principal food— 
pouring over the rice broth called koshan and subsequently they 
withdrew. Then we used to eat it, and whatever remained would 
be eaten by the dogs and birds. If any innocent child happened to 
take anything from that remnant they would beat him and compel 
him to eat cow’s dung which according to their belief purifies” 
(p. xxxiv). 

Reference may be made in this connection to a story, narrated 
in detail by Ibn Batutah himself, which throws a lurid light on the 
relation between the Hindus and Muslims in the very heart of the 
Muslim empire in North India. 

Ibn Batutah was appointed ambassador to China and proceeded 
from Delhi in July, 1342, with rich presents, and a guard of thousand 
horsemen. When they were in the neighbourhood of Aligarh they 
heard that the city of Jalall, about eleven miles to the south-east, 
was besieged by the Hindus, numbering about a thousand horsemen 
and three thousand infantry. By a surprise attack the Sultan’s 
cavalry guard “killed them (the infidel Hindus) to the last man and 
seized their horses and arms.” The ‘infidels’, however, continued to 
raid the suburbs of Jalall from their base on an inaccessible moun¬ 
tain. In course of one of these, Ibn Batutah and a few friends were 
surprised by the raiders and had to flee for their lives. Being hotly 
pursued, Ibn Batutah was captured and going to be killed, when one 
of the captors took pity on him and helped him to escape. After 
hiding himself in hills, forests, and fields, he came to a road. “But 
since that road was leading into a village of infidels”, Ibn Batutah 
took to a different road and hid himself. After seven days, famished 
by hunger and thirst, he reached “a thickly populated village of in- 
fiedels”. “I begged of them something to eat, but they refused to 
give anything”. One of them lifted an unsheathed sword to kill 
him, but let him off after taking his shirt. On the eighth day he 
chanced to come across a Muslim who took him to a Muslim ruler 
of a Hindu village (pp. 151-7). 

After all this we need hardly feel surprised at the attitude of 
the Muslims towards the Hindus. The Brahmans, says Ibn Batutah, 
“are revered by the infidels and inspire hatred in the Muslims” 
(p. 188). The dislike was mutual. “We used to meet infidels on 
this road at night; but as soon as they saw us they got out of the 
way until we had passed” (p. 183).

HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


Any one who reads Ibn Batutah’s account would be reminded 
of what Al-Birunl said regarding the attitude of the Hindus towards 
the Muslims, and vice versa. 205 Evidently things had not improved 
much even after the lapse of three hundred years. 

(b) Indian Literature 

Unfortunately we possess no chronicle of the period written by 
a Hindu save and except the second Rajatarahgini of Jonaraja. The 
terrible tales of persecution of the Hindus by Sultan Sikandar of 
Kashmir, as recorded by him, have been narrated above. 20c But 
isolated references to the persecution of the Hindus by the Muslims 
are not altogether wanting. The Muslim sway over South India be¬ 
yond the Krishna was of short duration, and confined to Madura, 
but the cry of anguish from this region in the far south has been pre¬ 
served in a local chronicle of Madura. The misery caused by the 
Muslims in this sacred city is also narrated in detail by GangadevI, 
the consort of prince Kampana of Vijayanagara. A few extracts are 
quoted below: 

“The temples in the land have fallen into neglect, as worship 
in them has been stopped. Within their walls the frightful howls 
of the jackals have taken the place of the sweet reverberations of 

jnridanga . The sweet odour of the sacrificial smoke and the 

chant of the Vedas have deserted the villages which are now filled 
with the foul smell of roasted flesh and the fierce noise of the 
ruffianly Turushkas. The suburban gardens of Madura present a 
most painful sight; many of their beautiful cocoanut palms have 
been cut down; and on every side are seen rows of stakes from which 
swing strings of human skulls strung together. The Tamraparnl is 
flowing red with the blood of the slaughtered cows. The Veda is 
forgotten, and justice has gone into hiding; there is not left any trace 
of virtue or nobility in the land and despair is writ large on the faces 
of the unfortunate Dravidas” 21 In spite of possible exaggeration, the 
general truth underlying this doleful and dismal picture is borne out 
by Ibn Batutah’s description of the monstrous cruelty perpetrated 
by the Muslim Sultan of Ma‘bar or Madura 21a 

Vidyapati, the famous poet of Mithila in the 15th century A.D. 
has given a gruesome account of the oppressions of the Hindus by the 
Turks. 215 After describing the vital differences between the two in 
social and religious customs he mentions how the Turks force the 
Hindus to work without pay, place the leg of the dead cow on the 
heads of Brahmanas, lick the sandalwood mark on their foreheads, 
tear off their sacred thread, break temples and build mosques in 
their place, abuse the Hindus and assault them. 


631 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The medieval religious writers of Bengal, particularly the Vaish- 
navas, have left a vast literature which contains casual references to 
the miserable plight of the Hindus in Bengal. These Vaishnavas were 
the most inoffensive and peaceful members of the Hindu community 
and their views cannot be regarded, by any stretch of imagination, to 
be tinged by political or racial bias of any kind. This literature re¬ 
flects the state of things prevailing in Bengal three hundred years after 
the Muslims had conquered it. It is important to bear this in mind, 
for it had been held by some that “after the first shock of conquest was 
over, the Hindus and Muslims prepared to find a via media whereby to 
live as neighbours”. 22 A positive and definite idea of the neighbourly 
relation between the two during the fifteenth and sixteenth cen¬ 
turies A.D. may be formed from the contemporary Bengali literature. 

The Chaitanya-mangala of Jayananda describes as follows the 
plight of the Brahmanas of Navadvipa, the birth-place of Chaitanya, 
shortly before his birth (A.D. 1485): “The king seizes the Brah¬ 
manas, pollute their caste, and even take their lives. If a conchshell 
is heard to blow in any house, its owner is made to forfeit his 
wealth, caste and even life. The king plunders the houses of those 
who wear sacred threads on the shoulder and put sacred marks on 
the forehead, and then bind them. He breaks the temples and up¬ 
roots Tulasl plants, and the residents of Navadvipa are in perpetual 
fear of their lives. The bathing in the Ganga is prohibited and 
hundreds of sacred Asvattha and jack trees have been cut down. 
The numerous Yavanas (Muslims) who reside in the Piralya village 
ruined the Brahmanas. The feud between the Yavanas and the 
Brahmanas is everlasting, and the terrible village of Piralya is close 
to Navadvipa. Misled by the false report of (the people of) Piralya 
that a Brahmana was destined to be the king of Navadvipa.. .the 
king (of Gauda) ordered the destruction of Nadiya (Navadvipa). 
Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya left Gauda with his family and kinsmen 
and fled to Orissa where he was honoured by its ruler Prataparudra.” 
Some time later, the king of Gauda changed his attitude and had 
the broken houses and temples repaired, but the Brahmanas whose 
caste was polluted remained for ever outside the fold of 
Hinduism.” 223 

Such pogroms of Hindus were not accidental or merely pass¬ 
ing episodes. As Jayananda so tersely puts it, the feud between 
the Yavanas and the Brahmanas was everlasting. So we find that, 
far from improving, the communal relation became even worse 
during the benign rule of ‘Ala-ud-dln Husain Shah (A.D. 1493-1519). 
who is generally regarded as the most liberal-minded Muslim ruler 
of Bengal. 


HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


Vijaya Gupta, one of the eulogists of Husain Shah, gives a grue¬ 
some detailed description of the outrage on Hindus by the Muslim 
qdzis, Hasan and Husain. These two made a pastime of baiting the 
Hindus in all possible ways. Anyone found with the sacred Tulasi 
leaf on his head (an obligatory Vaishnava custom) was taken to the 
qdzl with hands and feet bound, and heavy blows were administered 
to him. The piyad a(peon) tore away the sacred thread from a Brah¬ 
man and spat saliva in his mouth. On one occasion a Muslim mulld 
happened to pass by a hut in a wood where some shepherd boys were 
worshipping the goddess Manasd.i with the symbol of sacred earthen 
pots to the accompaniment of music. In righteous indignation the 
mulld made an attempt to break the pots, but was severely trounced. 
The mulld brought it to the notice of the two qdzl brothers who ex¬ 
claimed: “What! the scoundrel ( hardmzddah ) Hindus make so bold as 
to perform Hindu rituals in my village! The culprit boys should be 
seized and made outcast by being forced to eat Muslim bread.” So 
the two brothers gathered a large number of armed Muslims and 
proceeded towards the shepherd’s hut. The mother of the qdzis, a 
Hindu girl forcibly married by the former qazi, vainly tried to dis¬ 
suade her sons; they demolished the shepherd’s hut, broke the sacred 
pots into pieces, and threw away the offerings to the goddess. The 
affrighted shepherd boys had concealed themselves in the wood, but 
some of them were hunted out and seized . 23 

isana Nagara, another contemporary writer, describes the con¬ 
dition of the Hindus under Husain Shah as follows: 

“The wicked mlechchhas pollute the religion of the Hindus 
every day. They break the images of the gods into pieces and 
throw away the articles of worship. They throw into fire Srlmad - 
Bhdgavat and other holy scriptures, forcibly take away the conch- 
shell and bell of the Brahmanas (two necessary articles of worship), 
and lick the sandal paints on their bodies. They urinate like dogs 
on the sacred Tulasl plant, and deliberately pass faeces in the Hindu 
temples. They throw water from their mouths on the Hindus en¬ 
gaged in worship, and harass the Hindu saints as if they were so 
many lunatics let large .” 24 

The two great biographies of the great Vaishnava saint Chaita- 
nya, namely, the Chaitanya-charitdmrita and the Chaitanya-bhdga- 
vata , contain many stories of the religious bigotry of the Muslims 
and the consequent persecution of the Hindus. Both the books re¬ 
fer to a famous episode in the life of Lord Chaitanya. He had intro¬ 
duced the system of public worship in the form of kirtan (a sort of 
congregational song loudly sung together by a large number of men 
in public streets to the accompaniment of special musical instru- 


633 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ments). This enraged the Muslim qdzl, and one day when Chai- 
tanya’s devotees were singing the name of God in the streets of 
Nadiya (Navadvlpa in Bengal), he came out, struck blows upon every¬ 
body on whom he could lay hands, broke the musical instruments, 
and threatened with dire punishment all the Hindus who would 
dare join a tartan party in this way in his city of Nadiya. To pre¬ 
vent the recurrence of public kirtan, the qdzl patrolled the streets 
of Nadiya with a party. The people of Nadiya got afraid, but Chai- 
tanya decided to defy the qazi’s orders, and brought out a large 
kirtan party which was joined by thousands. The qdzl was at first 
wild with anger and held out the threat that he would destroy the 
caste of all the Hindus of Nadiya; but terror seized him when his eyes 
fell upon the vast concourse of people in a menacing attitude. He 
fled, and his house was wrecked by the angry crowd. The Chai- 
tanya-bhdgavata does not describe the sequel. But the other work, 
Chaitanya-charitamrita, describes how Chaitanya sent for the qdzl 
who was now in a more chastened mood, and the two had a cordial 
talk . 25 

As is usual with religious books, the author of the Chaitanya- 
charitdmrita attributes the change in the qazl’s attitude to a miracle. 
A more rational explanation of the qazl’s forbearance is probably 
to be found in the attitude of the Sultan. Shortly after the 
above incident, the author describes the visit of Chaitanya to Rama* 
keli, a village near the capital city of Gauda. When Sultan Husain 
Shah heard of the great ovation paid to the saint by millions of people 
along the whole route, he was surprised, and observed that one 
whom such a vast crowd follows without any expectation of material 
benefit must be a saint. He ordered the Muslim qazls not to injure 
him in any way and allow him to go wherever he liked . 26 

It would be wrong to infer from this, that Sultan Husain Shah 
had a tender heart for the Hindus. At least the contemporary 
Hindus thought otherwise. Even after Husain Shah issued the 
above order, the intimate followers of Chaitanya argued: “This 
Husain Shah had destroyed numerous temples in Orissa; the liberal 
views he expressed were but a passing phase, and might be changed 
at any moment by evil counsels of Muslim officials” 26a So they sent 
an urgent message to Chaitanya to leave the vicinity of the capital. 
One of the Hindu courtiers of the Sultan, when asked about Chai¬ 
tanya, deliberately misrepresented him as an ordinary sannydsl, in 
order to avert the Sultan’s wrath against a great Hindu saint . 27 

Sanatana, a trusted Hindu official of the Sultan, became an ardent 
devotee of Chaitanya. So he (Sanatana) spent his time in religious 
exercises in his house, and ceased to attend the court on plea of ill 


034 


HINDU MUSLIM RELATIONS 


ness. One day the Sultan paid a surprise visit and found Sanatana 
hale and hearty, engaged in religious discourse with twenty or thirty 
Vaishnavas. The Sultan got very angry and kept Sanatana in con¬ 
finement. Sultan Husain Shah was then making preparations for a 
military expedition against Orissa, and asked Sanatana to accompany 
him. But the latter refused, saying: “You are going to torment our 
gods(i.e. destroy the images and temples); I cannot go with you .” 28 
This firm reply to the iconoclastic Sultan offers a striking contrast 
to the fulsome eulogies paid to him by some contemporary Bengali 
poets. One of them, Vijaya Gupta, mentioned above, describes Husain 
Shah as an ideal king whose subjects enjoy all the blessings of life, 
and compares him to the epic hero Arjuna. Another goes even further 
and describes the Muslim Sultan, notorious for breaking Hindu 
temples, as the incarnation of Krishna in the Kali Age. All these 
merely indicate the degree of abject surrender and the depth of moral 
degradation of the Hindus of Bengal caused by three hundred years 
of political servitude and religious oppression . 283 Evidently a new 
spirit was infused into them by Chaitanya, at least for the time 
being. 

Throughout the Chaitanya-bhagavata there are casual references 
to Hindus being constantly oppressed by the fear that the public per¬ 
formance of Tartan , and even singing religious songs loudly in one’s 
own house, would provoke the Sultan and bring untold miseries upon 
the people of Nadiya. A section of them was therefore angry with 
the Vaishnavas, and once a rumour was spread that the Sultan had 
sent two boats full of soldiers to Nadiya to arrest those who sang 
klrtan. Many people expressed their amazement that Chaitanya 
and his followers were engaged in loudly singing klrtan at Rama- 
keli near the capital city, Gauda, without any fear of the terrible 
Muslim king living so near . 29 These incidental references constitute 
more valuable data than even the full-fledged stories of the sacri¬ 
legious conduct of the qdzls for making a proper estimate of the 
wretched condition of the Hindus. They had to live in perpetual 
dread of the religious bigotry and intolerance of the Muslims during 
the rule of even the most enlightened Muslim Sultan of Bengal. No 
wonder that many Hindus embraced Islam to get rid of this ignomi¬ 
nious fate. Duarte Barbosa who visited India during the reign of 
Husain Shah observes with reference to Bengal: “The Heathens of 
these parts daily become Moors to gain the favour of their rulers ”. 30 

But the Vaishnava literature also shows the brighter side of the 
relation between the Hindus and Muslims. When the qdzl of Nadiya 
met Chaitanva after the tumultuous riot mentioned above, he remind- 
ed the latter that his (Chaitanya’s) maternal grandfather was his 


635 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


(qazi’s) uncle according to the customary usage of the village, and 
therefore Chaitanya was his nephew. It is thus apparent that al¬ 
though there was no interdining and intermarriage between the 
Hindus and the Muslims, some sort of cordial neighbourly relation 
was fostered between the two communities living together in the 
same village or city. This is quite natural. But the pity of it is, that 
even such neighbourly feelings could neither mellow the bigoted 
fury of the Muslims against Hindu religion, as is proved by the 
conduct of the qazi himself; nor relax in any way the social 
bigotry of the Hindus which got the better not only of human¬ 
itarian feelings, but also of their age-long virtues of respect for 
guest and mercy towards helpless seekers of shelter, as exempli¬ 
fied by the refusal of food and water to a hungry and thirsty foreign¬ 
er, Ibn Batutah. Incidental references have been made in the above 
stories to the forcible marriage of a Hindu girl by a Muslim, 
and dubious methods adopted to make the Hindus lose their caste. 
Other corroborative concrete instances of these are met with in con¬ 
temporary literature. These were also so many sore points with the 
Hindus which widened the breach between the two communities. 

Three different lines of evidence—Muslim chronicles, the 
account of Ibn Batutah, and contemporary Indian literature—all 
agree in testifying to the fact that the basic and fundamental differ¬ 
ences between the two communities continued, as before, during 
the period under review. No doubt, mutual understanding was 
developed and there was a greater amount of cordiality in the nor¬ 
mal social relation between the two. Each was influenced by the 
other, in varying degrees, not only in different spheres of life, but 
also in ideas, beliefs, and even superstitions. But all these merely 
affected the external and superficial in man and society, and left 
untouched the core of the heart and the mind. It was only neces¬ 
sary to scratch the skin to bring out the Hindu and the Muslim in 
every Indian, individually or collectively.

to all sense-enjoyments, is not disqualified because of the efficacy of his Vedic 
studies and his five daily sacrifices in removing sins, while his earthly divinity 
is not lost by eating forbidden food and the like because of the similar efficacy 
of single mantras. Quoting in the next place a prima facie view which favours 
membership of a parishat for a Sudra of good character and conduct in prefer¬ 
ence to a Brahmana of bad character living in the same village, the author rejects 
the same on the ground that, as between the claims of birth and character, 
the superiority of the former is to be considered principally, while the latter is 
to be considered as far as possible.

la- Recently, Kazi Abdul Wadud has challenged the theory, to which ‘wide cur¬ 
rency was given by the scholarly writings of Risley, Beverly and Hunter,’ 
namely, “that the Mussalmans of Bengal sprang from the lower strata of 
the Hindus of the province, and that the sword of Islam was primarily res¬ 
ponsible for the conversion.” He has mostly relied on the arguments ad¬ 
vanced by Khundkar Muhammad Fazle Rabbi in his book The Origin of the 
Mussalmans of Bengal, among which he cites the following as the “most 
weighty”: “How to account for the comparative paucity of Mussalmans in 
Northern India, the seat of Muslim power for centuries, where the notorious 
sword of Islam could not have been shy”. It is forgotten that this objection 
may be advanced against any explanation that is offered to account for the 
large number of Mussalmans of Bengal, including those of Mr. Rabbi and 
Kazi Wadud, namely, (1) that a fairly large number of Mussalmans were not 
indigenous to Bengal, but went there as soldiers, Government officials and 
traders; (2) Bengal was a stronghold of Pathans. If the first argument had 
any validity, we would expect more Muslims in Upper India than in Bengal. 
As to the second, Bihar, and to a certain extent, Orissa, were also strongholds 
of the Pathans, and yet these two regions contain a much smaller percentage 
of Mussalmans than Bengal. (“The Mussalmans of Bengal” by Kazi Abdul 
Wadud in Studies in the Bengal Renaissance, edited by Atulchandra Gupta, 
pp. 460 ff.).

14. The case of Medini Rai, in Malwa (pp. 183-4), is a striking example. But 
even in this case his later career supports the theory enunciated here. There 
are a few cases on record where Muslims occupied a high post in Hindu 
State and vice versa. But the very small number of such cases supports the 
view mentioned in the text. The careers of Ganesa and his son, sketched 
above (pp. 208 ff), are other striking illustrations of the wide gulf that sepa¬ 
rated the Hindus and Muslims in politics. It is noteworthy that in spite of 
perpetual rebellions and usurpations, no Hindu ever succeeded in gaining the

CHAPTER XVIII 


ECONOMIC CONDITION* 

1. The Village and the City 

During the period under review the village, following the tradi¬ 
tional pattern of a unit more or less self-contained within its own 
limits, must have remained, as always, the backbone of India’s 
economy. There was, however, this important difference that, not 
to speak of North India, even in the South, the ancient self-govern¬ 
ing village-assemblies decayed and perished under the withering in¬ 
fluence of the quasi-feudal as well as centralized State administrations 
of the time. The economic life in the city, nevertheless, was main¬ 
tained, as of old, in full vigour during this period. The Moorish 
traveller Ibn Batutah, in the course of his Indian itinerary (1333-46 
A.D.), found great cities with rich markets in the Upper Ganga 
valley, in Malwa and Gujarat, in the Deccan and in Bengal, as well 
as in Malabar in the extreme south. In another context the same 
writer, while describing the magnificent port of Alexandria in 
Egypt, observes that he has not seen its equal in the universe, if 
exception is made in the case of Quilon and Calicut in Malabar, 
Sudak in the Crimea, and Zaytun in China. In the early sixteenth 
century the rich sea-ports of Gujarat, the Deccan, Malabar and Ben¬ 
gal are described by the Portuguese writer Barbosa as handling an 
extensive trade (inland, coastal and overseas) in a remarkable 
variety of merchandise. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries 
the city of Vijayanagara, because of its large size and huge popu¬ 
lation, its rich bazars , the number of its skilled craftsmen, and 
dealers in precious stones as well as other articles, impressed 
profoundly a succession of foreign visitors. One of these, the 
Portuguese Domingo Paes, describing its heavy traffic, observes that 
its streets and markets were full of countless pack-oxen making the 
passage in many streets difficult for men. In the kingdom of Vijaya- 
nagara, as in the independent Hindu kingdoms of older times, the 
temples played a large part in the public economy in the capacity 
of landlords and employers of labour, as well as of banks advancing 
loans to debtors on the security of their lands. 1 

2. Agriculture, Horticulture and Animal Husbandry 

The extensive cultivation of food grains and other crops, and 
nurture of fruit-trees as well as rearing of domestic animals by the 
Indians are vividly described by the foreign travellers of this period.

ECONOMIC CONDITION 


The advanced condition of agriculture was helped by the exceeding 
fertility of the soil to which these travellers frequently refer. We 
begin with a fairly exhaustive list of Indian agricultural and other 
products given by Ibn Batutah at the beginning of the narrative of 
his Indian travels. We learn from him that the soil was so fertile 
as to produce two crops every year, namely seven varieties of 
autumn crops (including millet, peas and beans of different kinds), 
four varieties of spring crops (wheat, barley, chick peas and 
lentils). To this he adds that sesame and sugar-cane were culti¬ 
vated along with the autumn crops, and that rice was sown three 
times a year. The list of Indian fruit-trees consisted of mangoes, 
jack-fruits, black-berries and oranges of three varieties, such as were 
unknown to the traveller in any other country, as well as the fami¬ 
liar pomegranate which bore fruit twice a year. The list of vege¬ 
tables included ginger and pepper which, like the mango, were 
prepared into pickles. Coming to the different localities, the writer 
noticed an abundance of fine rice at Sarsuti (modern Sirsa on the 
north of a dried bed of the Ghaggar river), of sugar at Kanauj, of 
wheat and betel-leaf at Dhar (in Malwa), as well as the supreme 
excellence of wheat (matched only by that of China) at Marh (near 
Gwalior). At Daulatabad, grapes and pomegranates were grown 
twice a year, while at Sagar (on the Narmada, nearly thirty miles 
from its mouth) there were orchards of fruit-trees, and the lands 
were irrigated by water-wheels. In the early part of the sixteenth 
century, according to Barbosa, wheat, millet, gingelly, peas and 
beans were grown abundantly and cheaply in the kingdom of 
Gujarat. In ‘the Deccan kingdom’ (the Bahmani Sultanate) the 
same traveller noticed many beautiful villages with well-tilled land 
and good breeds of cattle; as well as other villages with very fair 
gardens for the cultivation of betel-leaf. The villages belonging to 
the coastal province of ‘Tulu-nad’ (north and south Kanara), we are 
further told, yielded a great store of good (white) as well as coarse 
(black) rice along with sugar and myrobalan of good quality, which 
found a market in Malabar on the one side and Arabia and Persia 
on the other. In South India, Malabar was noted during these cen¬ 
turies, as at all other times, for its spices. In the fourteenth cen¬ 
tury Abu-’l-Feda and Ibn Batutah aptly described Malabar as “the 
pepper country”, while in the following century Odoric and John 
de Marignolli declared it to be the only country in the world for the 
growth and supply of pepper. The ginger of Malabar, according to 
Odoric, was the best in the world. Along the great coastal road of 
Malabar there was, according to Ibn Batutah, not a span of land left 
uncultivated, and everyone had his separate garden with his house 
in the middle. Among other products Ibn Batutah noticed cocoa- 

641 


D. S.—41 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


nuts, betel-nuts and areca-nuts, of which the last grew in such abun¬ 
dance in a particular area as to form an article of export to China. 
In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries four Chinese writers 
(Wang Ta-Yuan, Ma Huan, Fei Hsin, and Huang Sheng-tseng) 
noticed cocoa-nuts, betel-nuts, jack-fruits, catechu and especially 
pepper (which was grown in gardens) among the products of Mala¬ 
bar. According to Barbosa, cocoa-nuts were grown along the whole 
sea-beach of Malabar, and the ten or twelve uses, to which it was 
put by the people, made them immune from dearth at all times. 
The flourishing condition of agriculture in the Vijayanagara king¬ 
dom is repeatedly mentioned by the foreign writers. According to 
the region was well-cultivated and very fertile, and it produced 
a great quantity of food-grains and cotton as well as oil-seeds. The 
dearth of water, on account of the small number of streams and the 
scanty rainfall, was met to some extent by the use of lakes fed by 
the collection of rain-water and by springs. The fellow-traveller of 
Paes, Barbosa, was struck with the wide cultivation of rice, peas, 
beans and other pulses, as well as the extensive breeding of domes¬ 
tic animals in the kingdom. Within the circuit of Vijayanagara city 
there were, according to ‘Abd-ur-Razzaq, excellent gardens with 
fruit-trees of different kinds, as well as fields irrigated with water 
from the lakes. In Orissa, at the time of Firuz Tughluq’s invasion 
(1360), as we learn from the contemporary Muslim chronicler, the 
inhabitants had fine gardens of fruit-trees in their houses, while the 
cattle and sheep were so numerous that they found no buyers, and 
the horses were sold at the extraordinary cheap price of ten copper 
coins ( jitals ) each. In Bengal Ibn Batutah, descending down ‘the 
Blub River’ (identified with the Barak or the Surma River in Sylhet 
District), from ‘the glorious and beautiful city of Habanq’ (identified 
with a ruined site near Habiganj), passed through villages and or¬ 
chards which reminded the traveller of those along the banks of the 
Nile in Egypt. The long list of cereals and vegetables of Bengal, 
noticed by Ma Huan in the middle of the fifteenth century, com¬ 
prised rice growing twice a year, millet of two varieties, sesamum 
and beans, ginger, mustard, onions and garlic, cucumber and egg¬ 
plant. Other products mentioned by the same writer are cocoa-nut 
and betel-nut, banana, jack-fruit and pomegranate, sugar-cane, and 
honey. Another Chinese writer of the same period, Fei Hsin, 
makes particular mention of the mango. In ‘the city of Bengala’ 
(probably meaning the capital city of Gauda with its sea-port at 
Satgaon on the eastern branch of the Ganga), there were, according 
to Barbosa, many cotton fields, sugar-cane, ginger and pepper plan¬ 
tations, as well as gardens of orange, lemon and other fruit-trees, 
the good white sugar produced from the sugar-cane finding a good 


642

market in other lands. There was likewise an abundance of horses, 
cows, sheep, and domestic fowl. 2 

3. Textile manufacture 

The textile industry of India appears from all accounts to have 
flourished as well in these as in the preceding centuries. From the 
detailed and valuable report of Barbosa it appears that Gujarat, by 
the beginning of the sixteenth century, led the way in the volume of 
manufacture of Indian textiles. The great industrial city of Cam- 
bay, containing skilled craftsmen of many kinds ‘as in Flanders’, is 
especially mentioned by the foreign writer for the abundance and 
cheapness of its woven white cotton fabrics (of both coarse and fine 
varieties), its printed cotton stuffs, its silk cloth, coloured velvets, 
velvety satins, and thick carpets, as well as its very beautiful quilts, 
its finely worked and painted testers of beds and its quilted articles 
of clothing. Coloured and richly embroidered silk along with cotton 
cloths, we are further told, were extensively manufactured at the 
sea-port of Patenexy (probably Veraval-Somnath). How the Cam- 
bay cloths found an extensive and most valuable market by the Red 
Sea route into Western Europe, and by the East African route to the 
great Bantu kingdom in the interior of South Africa, while the print¬ 
ed cotton and silk stuffs ( patolds ) of Cambay found their way via 
the Burmese and Malayan ports to the Indonesian Islands, will be 
told in the course of this chapter. 

Of the textile industry of the Deccan during this period, our 
knowledge is very scanty. Barbosa, however, while describing the 
trade of the ancient towns of Chaul and Dabhol, observes that great 
quantities of cloth were carried down to these ports from the interior 
for export to other land in return for the merchandise imported 
from outside. We have fuller information of the textile industry of 
South India during these times. In Malabar the town of Shaliyat 
(near Calicut) was already famous for its cotton fabrics at the time 
of Ibn Batutah’s visit. According to Ma Huan, a valuable variety 
of cotton cloth of standard size, each of which fetched as much as 
eight or ten gold pieces, was imported into Calicut from the adjoin¬ 
ing territory of ‘Kanpai’ (probably Koyampadi, a former name of 
Coimbatore). A kind of silk cloth with coloured stripes, likewise in 
standard size and fetching as much as a hundred gold coins apiece, 
we are told by the same writer, was produced by the people of this 
country. Coloured cotton stuffs and flowered chintz are included 
in more general terms among the products of the cities of Malabar 
by other Chinese writers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. 
Among the products of the Maidive Islands, strikingly enough, Bar¬ 
bosa, in the early sixteenth century, noticed very rich cotton, silk 


648 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


and gold cloths, while he thought the thin kerchiefs worn by the 
men in those islands around their caps to be so finely wrought and 
perfect as to be beyond the capacity of his country’s craftsmen. The 
famous printed cotton cloths of Pulicat, according to the description 
of the same writer, found a good market not only in Malabar and 
Gujarat but also outside India, as far as Burma, Malacca and 
Sumatra. 

In Eastern India, Bengal excelled in the abundance and variety 
of its finer textiles. At the time of Ibn Batutah’s visit in 1345, 
pieces of the finest cotton cloth were being locally sold at the extra¬ 
ordinarily cheap rate of thirty cubits for two silver coins (dinars). 
The Chinese writer, Ma Huan, writing in the middle of the fifteenth 
century, enumerated with their standard sizes and local names no 
less than six varieties of fine cotton stuffs, not to speak of silk bro¬ 
caded kerchiefs and head-coverings woven with gold. Similar but 
shorter enumerations of Bengal cotton stuffs are made by two other 
Chinese writers (Wang Ta-Yuan and Fei Hsin) of the fourteenth and 
fifteenth centuries, as well as by Barbosa in the beginning of the 
sixteenth century. The identifications of these varieties, though 
discussed by scholars for a long time, are still uncertain. According 
to the interpretaion of the French scholar Paul Pelliot, the list in Ma 
Huan would seem to comprise the following:—firstly, a white stuff, 
glossy like starch-paper, which has been variously, but not con¬ 
vincingly, identified with the bettela (organdi) of the Portuguese 
writers and the bairami of Ibn Batutah; secondly, turmeric cloth 
which has been plausibly identified with chintz; thirdly, a stuff of 
cotton gauze called shana-baf (wrongly written as shana-baft) in 
Persian; fourthly, stuff (as yet unidentified) which was used for 
making turbans; fifthly, a stuff corresponding probably to the chow - 
tar of later writers; sixthly, velvets of cotton. Whatever that may 
be, we learn from Barbosa that the Bengal cloths, no doubt because 
of their supreme excellence, found a good market in the two great 
international ports of Southern Asia at that time, namely Malacca 
in t;be East and Ormuz in the West. 3 

4 Work in precious metals as well as precious and semi-pre¬ 
cious stones, ivory work, and polishing of pearls 

J J» A. A->» 

The advanced condition of these industries during the period un¬ 
der review is indirectly proved by the testimony of the foreign ob¬ 
servers to the lavish display of jewellery and pearls (not to speak 
of the articles of gold and silver) at the courts of the great Hindu 
and Muslim rulers of the time, and to the use of costly ivory in the 
decoration of their furniture and palaces. Coming to the direct 


644 


ECONOMIC CONDITION 


evidence, we learn from the description of Barbosa that Gujarat, at 
the beginning of the sixteenth century, thanks to the skill of its 
craftsmen, stood pre-eminent in the volume of these industries as 
much as in that of its textile manufacture before mentioned. At the 
great city of Cambay where the best workmen of every kind were 
found, there were, according to Barbosa, very good goldsmiths who 
did very fine work. A great amount of work likewise was done 
there in coral, carnelian and other stones, while imitation stones and 
pearls were manufactured so well as to appear real. In the same 
city of Cambay, ivory was extensively used for inlay work in bra¬ 
celets and sword-hilts as well as chess-boards, and for the manu¬ 
facture of bedsteads as well as beads of different colours. From the 
carnelian mines (in the vicinity of Ratanpur in the former Rajpipla 
State) these stones were brought down to the neighbouring inland 
town of Limodara to be cut into different shapes and used for making 
knobs of dagger-hilts. To the same town of Limodara chalcedony 
was brought from the neighbouring mines to be cut into shape and 
bored for being made an article of trade. From the vivid descrip¬ 
tion of Barbosa we further learn that the Maidive Islands produced 
fine tortoise-shells which were exported to Gujarat. The ancient 
pearl-fisheries off Kayal (in the delta of the Tamraparni river in the 
present Tinnevelly district), which are described as a royal mono¬ 
poly, were worked by the local fishermen who likewise exploited 
the pearl-fisheries off the northern coast of Ceylon twice a year by 
permission of its ruler. At Pulicat and at the city of Vijayanagara, 
and above all at Calicut and other cities of Malabar, there existed a 
great industry for cutting and polishing precious stones like dia¬ 
monds, sapphires, and rubies which were procured principally from 
the Deccan, Ceylon, and Pegu respectively. 4 

5. Inland and coastal trade o 

We have direct evidence of the great volume of India’s inland 
and coastal trade from the accounts of the foreign travellers of this 
period. As regards the inland trade, Ibn Batutah, in the course of 
his Indian itinerary in the first half of the fourteenth century, fre¬ 
quently came across cities with large markets, one market at Delhi 
in particular being described by him as the largest in the world. 
From some incidental statements by the same author, we learn that 
Delhi was the common market for the sale of fine rice from Sarsuti, 
sugar from Kanauj, excellent wheat from Marh, and betel-leaf from 
Dhar. The Hindu merchants of Daulatabad, we are again told, dealt 
chiefly in pearls and were very wealthy. The inland trade was 
doubtless facilitated by the system of magnificent roads in existence 
at that time. Such was the great road extending from Delhi to 


045 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Daulatabad for a distance of forty days’ journey, and thence conti¬ 
nued to Telingana and Ma‘bar at a distance of six months’ journey 
on foot. On the former road there were three postal stations at 
every mile for the accommodation of travellers so as to give it, 
according to the picturesque description of the traveller, the ap¬ 
pearance of a market of forty days’ journey. On the other hand, the 
insecurity of travel, to which sufficient evidence is borne by the 
traveller’s own experience even in the vicinity of the imperial capi¬ 
tal, not to speak of the constant insurrections against the Sultan’s 
authority, must have seriously hampered the progress of trade. 

More light is thrown upon the condition of India’s inland trade 
by the detailed notices of Barbosa in the beginning of the sixteenth 
century. From the inland town of Limodara in Gujarat carnelian 
beads were carried in large quantities to the great sea-port of Cam- 
bay for export to Europe and East Africa. Copper imported from 
abroad was borne from the Deccan port of Dabhol in large quantities 
to the interior, whence were obtained in return cloth, wheat, millet, 
and pulses. The sea-port of Rander in Gujarat, thanks to the enter¬ 
prise of its foreign Muslim merchants, was the largest centre of trade 
in that region for the products of Malacca and China. At Goa, which, 
because of the exclusive policy of the Portuguese government, re¬ 
placed the southern port of Bhatkal as the great market for the sale 
of horses imported from outside, the dealers coming from the Deccan 
and the Vijayanagara kingdoms paid for each horse the extravagant 
price of 200 to 300 Portuguese gold coins along with a government 
duty of 40 such coins. According to Paes, an earlier writer, a great 
trade existed between the port of Bhatkal just mentioned and an 
inland town in the vicinity of Vijayanagara, as many as 5000 or 6000 
pack-oxen being employed for conveying the merchandise every 
year. In a long list of imports into the Vijayanagara kingdom men¬ 
tioned by Barbosa, we are told that diamonds were imported into 
the city from the neighbouring Deccan kingdom, other precious 
stones were brought from Pegu and Ceylon, pearls were obtained 
from Ormuz and Kayal, brocades from China and Alexandria, pepper 
from Malabar, coloured cloths, coral, metals, quicksilver, vermilion, 
saffron, rose-water, opium, sandal-wood, aloes-wood, camphor, and 
musk from other quarters. The horses from abroad were purchased 
by the king for the equivalent of 400 to 600 Portuguese gold coins 
for each of the common variety, and of 900 to 1000 such coins for 
each of those reserved for the king’s own use. Merchants from 
Vijayanagara made thier journeys to Pulicat, the great Indian 
market for the sale of Burmese rubies and musk at that time. 5 

We may now turn to the Indian coastal trade. From the de¬ 
tailed narrative of Ibn Batutah, and still more of that of Barbosa, it 


646 


ECONOMIC CONDITION 


appears that the Western coast of India was studded with a large 
number of sea-ports often possessing excellent harbours and exten¬ 
sive trade. Among these ports Diu in Gujarat, Goa in the Deccan, 
and Calicut, Cochin, and Quilon in Malabar appear from Barbosa’s 
description to have been the most prominent. The highly profitable 
direct trade between Gujarat and Malabar was almost completely 
monopolized by the Malabari merchants. In the fullest list of im¬ 
ports from Malabar (at Diu) are included cocoa-nuts, cardamoms 
and other spices, emery, wax and iron, palm sugar (from Malabar) 
and other sugar from Bhatkal, sandal-wood and brazil-wood as well 
as silks and other articles (from south-east Asia and China). The 
exports consisted mainly of cotton, cloth, wheat and other grains, 
horses, and carnelians. The coastal trade of the Deccan ports ap¬ 
pears to have been shared by both Gujarati and Malabari merchants. 
The former imported silk and cotton cloth, opium and common silk 
camlets, wheat, and gingelly, as well as horses, and they exported 
cotton and linen fabrics. The latter imported spices and drugs, 
areca-nuts and cocoa-nuts, palm-sugar, wax and emery, copper and 
quicksilver, and they exported cotton goods, wheat, rice, millet, gin¬ 
gelly oil, muslins, and calicoes. Coming to the Tulu region, we learn 
that its ports (principally Bhatkal) were visited by Malabar merchants 
who imported cocoa-nuts, spices, and palm-sugar, as well as palm- 
wine, and exported rice, iron, and another variety of sugar. The trade 
of the neighbouring island of Ceylon appears to have been largely 
controlled by the Indians. Merchants from Coromandel and Malabar 
as well as from the Vijayanagara, Deccan, and Gujarat kingdoms 
are described as visiting the island and especially its capital, Colombo- 
The imports consisted of very fine Cambay cotton cloths as well as 
saffron, coral, quicksilver, cinnabar, and especially gold and silver. 
The high profit of this trade is illustrated by the fact that the ele¬ 
phants were sold in Malabar and Coromandel at the rate of 400 or 500 
(rising up to 1000 or 1500) Portuguese gold coins, while gold and 
silver fetched more than their worth elsewhere. The coastal trade 
of Coromandel as well as the Vijayanagara kingdom was carried on 
largely by Hindu and Muslim merchants from the cities of Malabar, 
the imports consisting of areca-nuts, cocoa-nuts, pepper, palm-sugar, 
Cambay cloths and horses, and the exports comprising rice and 
cloth, and in the case of Coromandel, even children sold into slavery 
by their parents in times of famine. Muslim ships in large numbers 
visited Pulicat, the great market for Burmese rubies and musk. The 
famous muslins of Bengal (classified under four different heads), 
along with good white cane-sugar, was exported by the Muslim mer¬ 
chants in their own ships to Malabar and Cambay and other tracts, 


647 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the price of these goods in Malabar being sufficiently high to be noted 
carefully by the Portuguese writers. 6 

6. Overseas trade—The Persian Gulf , Arabia and East Africa 

The vast overseas trade of India with Western Asia flowed 
during this period, as in the previous centuries, along the two an¬ 
cient routes marked out by nature as international highways of her 
commerce. The merchandise was carried along the Persian Gulf 
and thence overland through Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean 
coast, and also by the sea-route to the Red Sea ports, and then, 
through Egypt, to the same destination; it was thereafter distributed 
over western Europe by the Venetian and other Italian merchants. 
In the latter part of the European Middle Ages, Ormuz (transferred 
from its old vulnerable site on the mainland to a secure position in 
a neighbouring island about the year A.D. 1300) became the grand 
emporium of the trade by the former route, while Aden and Jiddah, 
(the port of Mecca), were the two great emporia of the trade by the 
latter route. In the early part of the fourteenth century, as we 
learn from Ibn Batutah, Ormuz was the entrepot of the trade of 
Hind and Sind, the merchandise of India being carried thence to the 
two Iraqs, Ears and Khurasan. Aden was then the port of call for 
India’s great ships arriving there from Cambay, Thana, Quilon, 
Calicut, Fandarina, Shaliyat, Mangalore, Fakanor, Hinawar; Sinda- 
bur and so forth. A colony of Indian merchants lived in this city. 
A minor entrepot of the Indian trade was the neighbouring port of 
Zhafar (Dofar) which exported valuable horses to India in return 
for Indian rice and cotton. On the Indian side Malabar (completely 
replacing the Coromandel coast) was the great clearing house of the 
merchandise from the East and the West across the Indian Ocean. 
Merchants of Fars and Yemen, we are told by Ibn Batutah, disem¬ 
barked mostly at the port of Mangalore, and Chinese ships bound 
for India entered only the ports of Ely (Hili), Calicut, and Quilon. 
In the work of Barbosa we have a valuable report (as detailed as it 
is accurate because of being based on the author’s personal know¬ 
ledge) of India’s maritime commerce with the Western world in the 
beginning of the sixteenth century. We learn that an extensive 
and highly profitable trade was borne between the Indian ports, Diu, 
Chaul, Dabhol, Goa, Bhatkal, Calicut and so forth, on the one side, 
and those of Arabia and Persia, such as Jiddah (until the suppression 
of its trade by the Portuguese), Aden, Esh-Shihr and Ormuz, on the 
other. In a comprehensive list of imports from India into Ormuz 
are included pepper, cloves, ginger and cardamoms, sandal-wood and 
brazil-wood, saffron, indigo, wax, iron, sugar, rice, cocoa-nuts, pre¬ 
cious stones, benzoin, porcelain, cloths from Cambay, Chaul, and 


648 


ECONOMIC CONDITION 


Dabhol, as well as Bengal muslins. The exports carried to India on 
the return voyage are said to have consisted of Arabian horses (to the 
number of one thousand to two thousand), dates, raisins, salt, sul¬ 
phur and coarse seed-pearls. Equally impressive was the extent of 
traffic between the Indian ports and Aden, which was adjudged by 
Barbosa to have a greater and richer trade than any other place 
in the world. For while ships from Cambay brought to it cotton 
cloth in ‘astonishing quantities’ as well as drugs, gems, seed-pearls 
and carnelians in abundance, and carried back madder, opium, cop¬ 
per, quicksilver, vermilion, rose-water, gold, woollens, coloured 
velvets, and camlets (stuff of mixed silk and wool), those from Chaul, 
Dabhol, Bhatkal, and Calicut imported rice, sugar, cocoa-nut and 
spices, and those from Bengal brought muslins and sugar. The 
Muslim merchants of Cambay, Chaul, Dabhol, Bhatkal and Malabar 
imported cotton cloths, inferior gems, rice, sugar, and spices into 
the neighbouring Arabian port of Esh-Shihr, whence they exported 
many excellent horses as well as much frankincense. Some addi¬ 
tional points are indicated by the author’s detailed notices of the 
overseas trade of different Indian ports. Ships from Cambay, we 
read, carried to Aden, Mecca and Ormuz cotton and linen cloths, 
large carpets, coloured cloth as well as spices, and brought back 
coral, quicksilver, vermilion, lead, gold and silver, alum, madder, 
rose-water and saffron, as well as opium of superior quality. 
Merchants from Ormuz brought horses in large numbers to Goa. 
Rice was exported from Barkur to Ormuz, Aden and Esh-Shihr. 
The foreign Muslim merchants of Calicut made their great annual 
voyages (from February down to the middle of August, September 
and October of the same year), in their fleets of ten to twelve 
ships, to Aden as well as the Red Sea ports and back. They im¬ 
ported pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamoms, myrobalans, tamarinds, 
precious stones, seed-pearl, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloes-wood, 
and cotton cloths, as well as porcelains, and they brought back from 
Jiddah copper, quicksilver, vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, 
rose-water, coloured camlets, gold, and silver. In the list of India’s 
imports mentioned so far, rose-water and frankincense, and above 
all horses, are especially stated to be the products of Arabia. Other 
merchandise like copper, quicksilver, vermilion, coral, woollen and 
silken cloths found at Jiddah and Aden for the Indian market were 
doubtless imported from Europe in return for the Indian merchan¬ 
dise which (we are expressly told) was carried via Suez and Cairo 
to Alexandria for distribution by the Italian merchants over the 
rest of the European world. 7 

Though we have but little direct knowledge of the condition of 
India’s ancient trade with East Africa, we may reasonably conclude 


649 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


that it was fostered by the chain of Arab settlements on the African 
coast like those of Zeila, Makdashau, Mombasa and Kilwa, visited 
by Ibn Batutah in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and, in 
part, by the Chinese imperial missions under Cheng-ho, in the early 
part of the fifteenth. We owe our first complete and detailed account 
of this trade to Barbosa in the early part of the sixteenth century. 
Many ships from ‘the kingdom of Cambay’ (Gujarat), we are told, 
visited Makdashau with plenty of cloths and spices and returned 
with rich cargoes of gold, ivory and wax. Cambay cloths and beads 
were exported by Gujarati merchants in large ships to the three 
ports of Melinde, Mombasa, and Kilwa, whence they were carried 
by the local Muslim merchants to the ports of the Zambesi delta 
and Sofala, further south, for sale to the inhabitants of a great Bantu 
kingdom in the interior. The cargoes of gold and ivory, obtained 
from the latter in return, were conveyed via Sofala to the three 
East African ports, mentioned above, whence they were carried 
back home by the Gujarati merchants. The enormous profit of this 
trade is illustrated by certain figures. The Cambay cloths, we are 
told, were exchanged at the three African ports for gold at a 
sufficiently attractive price, and when they were carried to Sofala, 
they were exchanged for gold without weighing. The African ivory 
was sold in the kingdom of Gujarat at the rate of five or six gold 
coins in Portuguese currency for about one hundred and twelve 
pounds in English weight. 8 

7. Overseas trade — South-East and East Asia 

The direct trade established by the Chinese with India during 
the twelfth century appears to have been continued and developed 
during this period. It received a great impetus through the series 
of maritime expeditions fitted out by the Chinese Emperor Yung-Lo 
(1403-24), culminating in a succession of seven such expeditions led 
by the eunuch Cheng-ho during and after his lifetime (between 
A.D. 1405 and 1433). In the early part of the fourteenth century, 
as we have noticed above, regular voyages were made by Chinese 
ships to the three Malabar ports of Ely, Calicut and Quilon. The 
popular customs and trade of the regions along the Indian coast, 
together with those of the countries and ports of the rest of southern 
Asia and of a small portion of the coast of East Africa, are described 
by four Chinese writers in their works written between A.D. 1349 
and 1520. The Chinese imports into the Indian ports followed a 
set pattern, the merchants bringing silks, coloured taffetas and satins, 
cloves and nutmegs, blue and white porcelain, gold, silver, copper, 
iron, vermilion, and quicksilver for exchange with the Indian pro¬ 
ducts. We have a full and valuable account, based on information 


650

supplied by the merchants actually engaged in this trade, in the 
work of Barbosa which we have quoted so often. Malacca, estab¬ 
lished as an independent Muslim State in the fifteenth century 
A.D., 8a was the great international port of south-east Asia at that 
time. It contained a colony of wholesale merchants (Hindu and 
Muslim) who owned large estates and great ships. It was visited 
by ships from Tenasserim, Pegu, Bengal, Pulicat, Coromandel, 
Malabar, and Gujarat as well as the islands of south-east Asia. The 
list of its imports (evidently from India) included pepper, incense, 
Cambay cloths, saffron, coral, printed and other white cotton cloths 
from Bengal, vermilion, quicksilver, opium, and other goods from 
Gujarat. The Cambay, Pulicat, and Bengal cloths as well as the 
Cambay drugs and beads were carried to the islands of Java, 
Sumatra, the Moluccas, Timor, Banda, and Borneo to be exchanged 
for the characteristic products of those tracts. These were gold 
from Sumatra, cloves from the Moluccas, white sandal-wood from 
Timor, mace and nutmegs from Banda, camphor from Borneo, along 
with aloes-wood from Champa. No wonder that Malacca is des¬ 
cribed by Barbosa as the richest sea-port with the greatest number 
of wholesale merchants and the largest volume of shipping and trade 
in the whole world. Ranking next in importance to Malacca was 
Pegu, with three or four rich harbours on an inlet of the sea. The 
imports brought there every year in Muslim ships, evidently from 
India, included printed Cambay and Pulicat cloths in cotton and 
silk (called patolds), opium, copper, scarlet cloth, coral, vermilion, 
quicksilver, rose-water and Cambay drugs in large quantities, while 
the exports comprised Burma lac of very fine quality, mace, cloves, 
musk, and rubies. The above account may be supplemented by 
Barbosa’s notice of the east Asiatic trade of individual Indian ports. 
Merchants from Rander (on the northern bank of the Tapti estuary 
above Surat), we are told, sailed in their own ships as far as Pegu, 
Martaban, Tenasserim and Sumatra, trading in spices and drugs, 
silks, musk, benzoin, porcelain, and other merchandise. Merchants 
from Quilon as well as The city of Bengala’ likewise sailed in their 
own ships to Pegu, Malacca, and Sumatra. 9 

8. Muslim control of India’s overseas trade 

No account of India’s overseas trade during this period will be 
complete without some reference to the nearly complete hold exer¬ 
cised over the same by the Arabs and the Persians, as well as the 
foreign and semi-foreign Muslims living on Indian soil, until this 
practical monopoly was destroyed by the systematic naval attacks 
of the Portuguese. In the great city of Cambay at the time of Ibn 
Batutah’s visit, foreign merchants formed the majority of the popu- 


651 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


lation, and they vied with one another in building fine houses and 
wonderful mosques which made Cambay one of the most beautiful 
cities visited by the traveller. In the neighbouring sea-port of 
Gandhar a Muslim merchant was the owner of six ships, one of 
which, carrying an escort of fifty archers and fifty Abyssinian 
soldiers, was offered to Ibn Batutah for the partial transport of his 
mission sent out from the court of Delhi to China. Mention is made 
likewise of Muslim ship-owner of Calicut owning many ships with 
which he traded with China on the one side, and Fars and Yemen 
on the other. The Shiah community of Quilon was so rich that 
one of them could buy a ship with its whole cargo for loading the 
same with his own merchandise. By contrast, the Hindu traders 
like those of Daulatabad, mentioned above, appear to have been 
almost wholly confined to the inland trade. 10 

By the beginning of the sixteenth century, as we learn from 
the detailed account of Barbosa, India’s overseas trade with western 
Asia and eastern Africa was almost completely controlled by the 
foreign and semi-foreign Muslim merchants living outside and with¬ 
in her shores. We hear, it is true, of wealthy Hindu merchants of 
the Baniya caste belonging to the kingdom of Gujarat as well as of 
those living in the sea-ports of the Deccan and Malabar. But these 
appear to have been engaged mostly, if not wholly, in the distri¬ 
buting trade at the ports. The great Hindu merchants of Gujarat 
are expressly mentioned as trafficking with their own folk. More 
than half a century earlier, Ma Huan described the rich Chetty 
merchants of Cochin and Calicut as engaged in selling to the strang¬ 
ers arriving at these ports precious stones, pearls, aromatics, and 
coral beads at standard rates. Altogether exceptional is the in¬ 
stance of Cannanore, where Hindu as well as Muslim merchants are 
described by Barbosa as sailing in their own ships as far as Ormuz. 
On the other hand, not only are Arabs and Persians mentioned as 
visiting Indian ports like Dabhol and Goa in many ships for trade, 
but the foreign Muslims of Gujarat are expressly stated to be trad¬ 
ing in their own ships with the western lands. The foreigners in 
Calicut, consisting of Arabs and Persians as well as immigrants 
from Gujarat and the Deccan, made their great annual voyages to 
Aden and the Red Sea coast, the volume of their imports and ex¬ 
ports being, as mentioned above, sufficiently impressive. The 
Cambay merchants, engaged in the immensely profitable trade with 
East Africa, and the merchants from other Indian ports trading simi¬ 
larly with Ormuz and Aden, must have belonged almost wholly to 
the class of foreign Muslim settlers. Indeed we are expressly told 
that foreign Muslim merchants lived in large numbers in Goa and 
other ports. 11 


652 


Economic condition 


Let us next turn to India’s coastal trade. According to Barbosa 
the Mappillas (descendants of Arab colonists by their union with 
local women), living in Malabar, were owners of large ships, and 
they so completely controlled the trade and navigation of this land 
as to suggest to the observant traveller that but for the arrival of 
the Portuguese it would have come under Muslim rule. To this 
class doubtless belonged the enterprising Malabaris who mostly 
controlled, as we have seen, the trade along the western coast. Many 
Muslim ships, almost certainly belonging to the Mappillas, are 
described as visiting every year Pulicat, the great Indian market 
for Burmese rubies at that time. Coromandel was included among 
the lands visited in their own ships by the foreign Muslims belong¬ 
ing to the above mentioned ‘city of Bengala’. 12 

In contrast with the practical monopoly enjoyed by the foreign 
and the semi-foreign Muslims over India’s trade with western Asia 
and eastern Africa and along her coast, Hindu and Muslim merchants 
shared her trade with south-east Asia at the beginning of the six¬ 
teenth century. While the Muslims of the city of Bengala as well 
as other Muslims are mentioned by Barbosa as visiting Pegu and 
Sumatra in their own ships for trade, the Hindu Chetties of Coro¬ 
mandel, along with Muslims, are described as travelling to Ava for 
the purchase of the rubies and musks of upper Burma in exchange 
for the Indian products. The Chetties as well as the Muslims formed 
the foreign colony of wholesale merchants at Malacca who were the 
owners of big estates and large ships. 13 

While the predominance of the Muslim traders in lands under 
rulers of their own faith requires little or no explanation, their 
command of the trade in the independent Hindu kingdoms is proved 
by the contemporary evidence to have been actively promoted and 
fostered by the policy of the kings,—a policy which is in line with 
the age-old indigenous tradition. From the vivid narrative of Ibn 
Batutah, we learn that the Hindu rulers of Malabar provided wooden 
houses with wells at every half mile, with special arrangements for 
the comfort of Muslim travellers, along the great coastal road of 
two months’ journey from Sandapur (near Goa) to Quilon. Because 
of the death penalty inflicted by these rulers, without any discri¬ 
mination for rank, even for the slightest theft (of which concrete 
and harrowing instances are given by the traveller), no road, ac¬ 
cording to his very experienced judgement, was safer than this. 
The Hindu ruler of Calicut extended this security to the goods of 
ship-wrecked merchants, so that the town became, in the words of 
Ibn Batutah, very flourishing, and drew a great influx of foreigners. 
The Hindu ruler of Quilon was especially noted for his high regard 


653 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


for Muslims who were much honoured in his kingdom. The colonies 
of Muslims in every city of Malabar lived under the jurisdiction of 
their own qdzls and worshipped freely in their big congregational 
mosques. 

In the early part of the sixteenth century, according to the vivid 
account of Barbosa, the Muslims enjoyed the same patronage from 
the Hindu rulers of the south. We have seen how the Mappillas 
of Malabar had acquired by that time such complete control over 
the trade and navigation of the land as to bring it, according to 
the considered judgement of the writer, to the brink of subjection 
to Muslim rule. Their numbers were being constantly swelled by 
voluntary conversion of the Hindu men and women and their own 
union with Hindu concubines of low caste. The foreign merchants 
of Calicut, who had their own governors for ruling and punishing 
them without interference from the king, were so numerous and 
powerful as completely to dominate the city until they were forced 
to abandon it under pressure of the Portuguese. It was their custom 
on their return voyages from the Red Sea ports every year to bring 
with them fresh foreign merchants, each of whom, on his arrival, 
was assigned by the king a Nayar body-guard, a Chetty accountant, 
and a broker for help in local purchases. In the preceding century 
Ma Huan found that all the affairs of the Calicut kingdom were 
conducted by two high Muslim officers who controlled the sale of 
all the merchandise brought into the city in Chinese junks. In the 
neighbouring territory of Kayal at the time of Barbosa’s visit, the 
Hindu ruler had farmed out for long the royal monopoly of the local 
pearl fisheries to a Muslim, who was so rich and powerful as to be 
honoured equally with the king. In Vijayanagara the complete free¬ 
dom of travel and worship granted by the king to everybody “with¬ 
out enquiry whether he was a Christian, Jew, Moor or Heathen”, 
as well as the great equity and justice shown to all by the ruler 
and his subjects, drew an enormous number of merchants to the city. 
Great Muslim as well as Hindu merchants lived at Pulicat, the 
frontier station of the Vijayanagara kingdom, which was likewise 
visited by Muslim ships in large numbers for trade. 14 

9. General Economic Condition of the people 

Our knowledge of the economic condition of the mass of the 
people in North India during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries 
is surprisingly scanty. We have therefore to fall back upon the 
full and detailed description drawn from personal observation by 
Ibn Batutah of the extraordinary splendour and magnificence of the 
court and capital of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq in the heyday 


654 


ECONOMIC CONDITION 


of the Delhi Sultanate. It may reasonably be concluded that this 
amazing affluence was built upon the immense booty obtained by 
Malik Kafur, the general of ‘Ala-ud-din Khaljl, from his devastating 
campaigns against the independent Hindu kingdoms of South India 
between A.D. 1309 and 1311. Whatever that may be, we are told 
that Delhi, comprising the four contiguous cities of Old Delhi, Slrl, 
Tughluqabad, and Jahanpanah, was the largest of all the cities of 
Islam in the East. At the Sultan’s public audiences, horses and ele¬ 
phants were displayed with silk and gold caparisons, and the high 
officials as well as provincial governors presented gold and silver 
utensils as well as solid pieces of gold and silver. The Sultan’s ‘Id 
darhdrs were prefaced by a procession of elephants adorned with 
silk-covered and jewel-studded seats and jewel-studded silk para¬ 
sols with golden handles. At the council-hall there were planted 
artificial trees of silk in three rows with gold chairs placed between 
them, and the Sultan sat on a high throne of pure gold with jewel- 
studded legs and a jewel-studded parasol raised over his head. At 
the great public dinner following the darbdr, the scent-burners burnt 
fragrant wood from huge censers of pure gold, and the meals were 
served by waiters from gold and silver utensils. In the following 
reign, that of Firuz Tughluq, we hear of the extraordinary cheap¬ 
ness of commodities, ranging from wheat and barley up to white 
and coloured silks. The economic prosperity of the Delhi Sultanate, 
however, was completely shattered by the catastrophe of Timur’s 
invasion at the end of the fourteenth century, when all the four 
cities of Delhi were thoroughly and mercilessly sacked by the in¬ 
vader’s troops, and an immense booty consisting of male and female 
slaves, precious stones and pearls, as well as gold and silver, was 
taken away from the unfortunate inhabitants of the capital. 15 

The foreign accounts, relating to the different parts of India 
in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries f tend to indicate that 
there was a wide diffusion of material prosperity in the country, 
and that the people in general lived a life of cultured ease and 
comfort. The exceptional prosperity of Gujarat in the beginning 
of the sixteenth century, arising no doubt from its highly advanced 
industry and trade, is well attested by Barbosa. The inland cities 
of Champaner and Ahmadabad, we are told, contained fine stone 
and mortar houses, with tiled roofs and large courtyards containing 
tanks and wells. Cambay was a great city with very lofty houses 
having windows and tiled roofs, well-laid-out streets and fine open 
places. The numerous wealthy merchants and skilled craftsmen liv¬ 
ing in the city led a luxurious life of pleasure and vice and were 
accustomed to good clothing and food. They always washed and 
anointed their bodies with sweet-smelling unguents, and decorated 


655 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


their hair with jasmine and other flowers. The merchants of the 
Muslim city of Rander lived in well-furnished houses in which the 
reception-rooms were surrounded with shelves all filled with rich 
porcelains. Among the Hindu castes of Gujarat, the Baniyas had 
orchards, fruit-gardens, and tanks in their houses, and they lived 
on a diet of milk, butter, sugar and rice. The men dressed them¬ 
selves in cotton and silk garments, anointed themselves with white 
sandal-wood, and wore gold ear-rings set with precious stones, finger- 
rings and golden girdles. The women wore silken bodices and other 
long garments, thick gold and silver ear-rings and anklets, as well 
as plenty of rings on their fingers and toes. Among the Muslim in¬ 
habitants of Gujarat, consisting mostly of foreigners, the men were 
dressed in rich cloth of gold, silk, cotton, and camlets, with very 
thick leather boots coming up to the knee. They were attended by 
pages bearing swords, finely damascened with gold and silver. They 
indulged in great luxury, living freely and spending greatly. 

Coming to the Deccan, we have in the brief account of Athana¬ 
sius Nikitin, a Russian traveller of the fifteenth century, a grim pic¬ 
ture of the contrast between the selfish pomp and luxury of the 
Sultan and his nobles, and the extreme misery of the common people. 
On the other hand, Barbosa, in the beginning of the following 
century, describes the whole of the Deccan as a very fertile terri¬ 
tory with large cities, towns, and villages, and a great trade. The 
port of Goa is especially described by the same writer as a very 
great city with good houses, vegetable and fruit gardens, and tanks 
of sweet water. Because of its extensive inland as well as overseas 
trade, as described above, it yielded to the Portuguese Government 
an enormous annual revenue of forty thousand ducats. 

In South India, Malabar enjoyed a very high level of prosperity, 
no doubt because of its extensive industry for cutting and polishing 
precious stones, and especially on account of its flourishing coastal 
and other trade. The whole territory, we are told, was so well 
populated that it might be called one town, from Mount d’Ely in the 
north (the promontory near Hili) to Quilon in the south. Among 
the communities inhabiting this tract the Chetties (immigrants from 
Coromandel) are described as wearing ear-rings of gold set with 
precious stones, and many finger-rings and girdles of gold and jewel¬ 
lery, while the Mappillas are said to have lived well and the foreign 
merchants are mentioned as owners of very fine houses, who ate and 
drank luxuriously and were dressed in garments of silk, scarlet-in- 
grain, camlets, and cotton. The extraordinary prosperity of the 
Vijayanagara kingdom must have been largely due to its extensive 
trade, which was fostered by the enlightened and tolerant policy 


656 


ECONOMIC CONDITION 


of its rulers. In the fifteenth century the city, according to Nicolo 
Conti, was sixty miles in circuit and, in the opinion of ‘Abd-ur Razzaq, 
was without any equal in the world. In the city of Bidrur (Belur), 
which he passed on his way from the sea-coast to Vijayanagara, 
‘Abd-ur Razzaq observed houses which were like palaces. Speaking 
of the city of Vijayanagara, the same traveller observes that its 
seventh and innermost fortress occupied a space ten times greater 
than the chief market of Herat. In the sixteenth century the New 
City (Nagalapuram, modern Hospet, to the west of Vijayanagara 
city) contained, according to the description of Paes, very beautiful 
rows of buildings with artificial tanks and a large population con¬ 
sisting of many merchants, while it was connected with the old city 
by a wide street with rows of houses and shops on either side. The 
city of Vijayanagara is said by the same traveller to have been as 
large as Rome, and very beautiful, because of its groves of trees and 
its gardens with water-conduits and lakes. Within the inner city, 
all streets were bordered by very beautiful rows of well-decorated 
houses. Vijayanagara is described by the same observant traveller 
as the best-provided city in the world, and as being unlike other 
cities that often failed of supplies and provisions. The author was 
particularly struck with the extraordinary cheapness of the prices 
of domestic birds and game animals, poultry, hares and partridges, 
doves and pigeons sold alive, the number and quality of pigs and 
sheep killed for food everyday, the large quantity of butter, milk 
and oil sold daily and the unparalleled extent of the rearing of cows 
and buffaloes in this city. We have a hint of the luxurious habits of 
the people in the testimony of ‘Abd-ur Razzaq that they considered 
sweet-smelling flowers as a necessity without which they could not 
exist. From the description of Barbosa we learn that while the 
king and the nobles lived in palaces, others lived in thatched, but 
very well-built, houses in streets, with many open places, and that 
the greater portion of the inhabitants was very wealthy. The men 
wore garments of cotton or silk or brocade, and they anointed their 
bodies after bathing with scented powder mixed with rose-water, 
while they adorned themselves with finger-rings set with precious 
stones and ear-rings set with fine pearls. They were attended by 
pages armed with swords and servants holding costly umbrellas. 
The women wore garments of very thin cotton and bright-coloured 
silk, as well as embroidered leather shoes, and adorned themselves 
with ear-rings of gold and jewels, bracelets of gold and precious 
stones, and armlets of coral beads. After the above references to 
the prosperity of the great body of the people in the Vijayanagara 
city and kingdom, it seems unnecessary to mention the foreign 
accounts of the gorgeousness of the royal court and palace, or of 

657 


D. S.—42 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


the pomp and splendour of the religious festivals conducted under 
the king’s superintendence every year. 

Turning to Eastern India, we are told by Wang Ta-Yuan, a 
Chinese writer of the fourteenth century, that because of the cheap¬ 
ness of living in Orissa, nine out of ten persons going there for trade 
did not like to return home. Rice, which was evidently the staple 
food of the people, was sold at the unbelievably low price of 46 
baskets for one cowrie. We have a fuller and more detailed account 
of the economic prosperity of Bengal from the foreign writers rang¬ 
ing from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries. The prices of 
commodities in Bengal, Ibn Batutah declared, were cheaper than in 
any other country visited by him in the whole world. The author 
justified his statement by quoting a long list of the current prices of 
commodities such as rice and paddy, milch cows, hens, pigeons, 
lambs, sugar, ghee, sesame oil, the finest cotton cloth, as well as male 
and female slaves. An old inhabitant of Bengal told the Moorish 
traveller that he maintained himself with his wife and servant for 
one whole year at a cost of 8 small silver coins {dirhams). In the 
following century Nicolo Conti, sailing up the Ganga from its mouth, 
found that its two banks were adorned with most charming villages 
and plantations as well as gardens of various fruit-trees. From Fei 
Hsin, a Chinese writer of the first half of the same century, we learn 
that the men dressed themselves in cotton garments and sheep-skin 
shoes with gold thread, while the women wore garments of cotton, 
silk, or brocade, and adorned themselves with ear-rings of precious 
stones, gold necklaces, gold bracelets, and rings on fingers and toes. 
In the early sixteenth century, the respectable Muslims of the city 
of Bengala are described by Barbosa as wearing white cotton smocks 
with silk scarves, and carrying daggers ornamented with silver and 
gold in their girdles, and having rings set with jewels on their fin¬ 
gers. They lived a life of luxurious ease eating well and spending 
freely. The women had a great store of gold and silver and were 
dressed in fine silk. We may conclude by quoting the account of 
Huang Sheng-tseng, a Chinese writer of the early sixteenth century, 
of the reception of an embassy from the Chinese imperial court by 
the ruler of Bengal at his capital, Panclua, in A.D. 1415. At the 
audience-hall which had pillars plated with brass figures of flowers 
and animals, over a thousand men were drawn up in shining armour 
and hundreds of soldiers were mounted on elephants. The king, 
who had hundreds of peacock-feather umbrellas around him, sat 
on a high throne inlaid with precious stones. The presentation of 
the envoys was followed by a great banquet and the king’s gift of 
gold and silver basins, girdles, flagons, and bowls, as well as gowns 
of white hemp and silk, to the members of the mission. 16

CHAPTER XIX

I. INTRODUCTION 

With the establishment cf Islam as the dominant political power 
in India, the country was confronted with a new religion and a 
new culture, alien in temperament as well as in spirit. 

Islam entered India through Western Asia, and the two coun¬ 
tries that played significant roles in the Islamic phase of Indian 
history were Persia and Afghanistan. From millenniums before 
Christ, India and these regions are known to have fruitful cultural 
contacts in which each made significant contributions to the deve¬ 
lopment of the other. Arthur Upham Pope has ably demonstrated 
how Indian ideas in art and architecture migrated to Western Asia 
and reached concrete forms under the technical ingenuities of the 
Persian builders. Indeed, many of the fundamental forms in Persian 
architecture, such as the pointed and trefoil arches, the transverse 
vault, the octagonal form of the building, the dome, etc., originated 
in India, but mainly as ideas and suggestions which reached practical 
realizations through the technique of Persia. “In short”, Pope ob¬ 
serves, “India has proposed and Persia disposed, but what India 
gave, she received back in a new form that enabled her to pass 
to fresh architectural triumphs.” 1 It is through such cultural con¬ 
tacts that art in the west acquired substance and individuality which 
the establishment of Islam could hardly change or alter. With the 
coming of Islam, India and the West were again brought nearer and 
the new impact, instead of extinguishing Indian architectural tradi¬ 
tions, opened the way for the infusion of new energies and new 
architectural aspirations. 

The early Muslim rulers, as noted above, were carried by their 
iconoclastic zeal to demolish the Indian temples in a ruthless man¬ 
ner. When, therefore, they proceeded to build mosques for their 
worship, they found in these broken Indian temples cheap mate¬ 
rials for their new constructions. Further, as artists, builders or 
craftsmen, naturally enough, did not accompany the victorious 
Muslim armies to India, the early Muslim rulers had perforce to 
employ the builders and craftsmen, who or whose forefathers had 
built the old temples, for dismantling them and erecting with 
their materials the buildings of the new faith. The famous Quwwat- 
ui-Islam mosque, near Qutb Minar, for example, as an inscription 


661 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


at its entrance testifies, was built out of the materials of twenty- 
seven demolished Hindu or Jain temples. The task was facilitated 
by the fact that certain features were common to both forms of 
architecture, whether Hindu or Muslim, in spite of the fundamental 
differences between the two. We may cite, for instance, the plan 
of the open court encompassed by colonnades, characteristic of many 
Hindu and Jain temples as well as of every Muslim mosque. Hindu 
and Jain temples, built on this plan, could thus be easily transformed 
into mosques for the faithful, with only slight and minor alterations. 
This is what the Muslim rulers did in the early days of their occu¬ 
pation, and that also with a remarkable skill. The Quwwat-ul-Islam 
mosque, mentioned above, represents one of the most instructive 
examples of such a case. The Muslim rulers found the Indian build¬ 
ers and their traditions extremely useful and efficient, and inter¬ 
fered but little with them, except for supplying the necessary guid¬ 
ance and supervision to ensure the observance of the basic principles 
of the Islamic prayer-house. 

When the Muslim power was firmly established in the country, 
the rulers imported experienced builders and craftsmen from the 
West, mainly Persia. The tradition that they brought was based 
on the accumulated experience of centuries in which, as already ob¬ 
served, India had also played not an insignificant part. The two 
traditions were thus again brought together and were destined to 
build up a new and individual style of Islamic architecture which 
was Islamic and at the same time Indian. Indo-Islamic (Indo- 
Muslim), or Indian in its Islamic manifestation, would be the correct 
description of this new architecture. 

Islam had everywhere showed a pliancy in adopting the styles 
of the various peoples among whom it had established itself. In 
India also similar happenings may be recognized. The Indians also 
showed a remarkable adaptability in mastering the superior tech¬ 
nique and principles of construction which the Islamic architectural 
tradition brought in its train. When the fury of an alien impact 
subsided, it is natural that a spirit of co-operation and collectivism 
prevailed leading to a happy fusion of the alien elements and the 
birth of a new style of architecture in which it would be futile to 
assess, separately and individually, the Indian and the Islamic 
contributions. 

Yet, the broad features of such contributions may be briefly 
set forth, for a correct appraisal of the new style, on the basis of 
the work already done by Marshall 2 and Percy Brown 3 who have 
studied this problem with great interest and keen insight. The new 
architecture absorbed, or inherited, manifold ideas and concepts 


662 


ART 


from the ancient Indian, so many indeed, that there was hardly a 
form or motif which, in some guise or other, did not find its way 
into it. But more important than these visible borrowings of out¬ 
ward and concrete features is the debt which Indo-Xslamic architec¬ 
ture owed to the Indian for two of its most vital qualities—the quali¬ 
ties of strength and grace. In no other country are strength and 
grace so perfectly and harmoniously united as in India. These are 
the two qualities which India may justly claim for her own, and 
they are the two which, in architecture, count for more than all the 
rest. Through centuries of experience the Indians wrought grandly 
and magnificently with their materials, and the lesson was not lost 
even under the new regime. It is not, therefore, surprising that 
Muslim India produced more notable buildings than all the other 
countries that came under the influence of Islam. 

But much as the Muslim architecture of India owed to her 
older schools, it also owed as much, if not more, to the distinctive 
artistic traditions it had already built up outside India. For Islam 
brought with it not only infusion of new blood and vigour, but also 
architectural innovations gathered from other lands, notably Persia. 
A few notable instances may be cited. Before the advent of Islam 
concrete had been little used in India, and mortar, scarcely ever. 
Of the true arch assembled in the scientific manner, the Indians were 
not wholly ignorant, but they used it very seldom. The Indians 
also knew the construction of a vault by radiating voussoirs; but 
in spite of such knowledge the trabeate system had been the pre¬ 
vailing order in India. In the countries with which Islam came into 
contact in the early days of its phenomenal expansion, the arch and 
the dome, built on the true scientific principle, had been the key¬ 
notes of construction, and became, so to say, almost ritualistic 
necessities with the Islamic buildings. Concrete and mortar were 
also employed freely by the Islamic builders, and became two of the 
most important factors of their constructions. Due to the strength 
of their binding properties, it was possible for the new builders to 
span wide spaces with their arches, to roof immense areas with 
their domes and, in other ways, to achieve effects of grandeur and 
spaciousness such as the Indians had never dreamt of. Though, in 
their newly adopted styles, the Muslims frequently perpetuated the 
trabeate system under pressure of the indigenous tradition, it was the 
arch and the dome that they always regarded as particularly their 
own, and as symbolic of their faith. The Indians under the guidance 
of the new spirit were not slow to appreciate the merits and advan¬ 
tages of the new methods and principles, and adapted themselves 
accordingly. 


663 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Under the impact of Islam new forms, features, and decorative 
ideals were also introduced, thus enriching Indian architecture as a 
whole,, Among the characteristic features which Islam was respon¬ 
sible for introducing, mention should be made of the minar and 
the minaret, the pendentive and the squinch arches, stalactite and 
honey-combing, and the impressive half-domed portal. A few of 
these were already familiar to the Indians, though sometimes as mere 
ideas, and they became practical structural proportions under the 
guidance of the Islamic masters. In the decorative aspect of the 
buildings, also, there was a new and significant development. The 
decorative scheme of an Indian temple abounded, along with other 
floral and diaper designs, in figure sculptures, bold and fully plastic 
in effect. Such figure carvings were, however, repugnant to the 
ideas and tenets of Islam. But elaborate decoration and highly 
coloured ornament were at all times dear to the heart of the Muslim 
and in both these spheres he introduced striking innovations. The 
rich floral decorations of the Indian artists he supplemented with 
flowing arabesques, or intricate geometric devices of his own, or 
sometimes interwove with them (as only a Muslim calligraphist 
could do) the graceful lettering of his sacred texts and historical 
inscriptions. Nor was it enough that his buildings should be beauti¬ 
fied with a wealth of carving executed in stone, brick, or plaster; 
the Muslim required colour also, and this he supplied by painting 
or gilding, or by employing stones of various hues to accentuate 
the different architectural features. Later on, by the more laborious 
process of tesselating and pietra dura he reproduced the designs 
themselves in coloured stones and marbles. Still more brilliant were 
the effects he obtained by encaustic tiling, which he at first used 
sparingly and in few colours only, but later on, without restraint, 
to embellish the whole building with a glistening surface of enamel. 

The fusion of the Indian and the Islamic architectural traditions 
has justly been described as a kind of biological fertilisation lead¬ 
ing to the birth of a new school of Indian architecture, rightly called 
Indo-Islamic or Indo-Muslim. This architecture may be divided 
broadly into two distinct phases, the first covering the period of the 
Delhi Sultanate, and the second that of the Mughuls. The monu¬ 
ments of the first phase admit of a subdivision into two principal 
groups,—those erected under the aegis of the Delhi Sultans them¬ 
selves, and those under the patronage of the ruling dynasties of the 
succession States of the Delhi Sultanate. Fergusson 4 described the 
first as representing the ‘Pathan’ style. But, as noted above, of the 
five dynasties of the Delhi Sultans only the last one was of Pathan 
extraction. Fergusson’s nomenclature is thus historically inaccurate, 


664 


ART 


and has to be discarded. “The architecture evolved under these 
dynasties”, observes Percy Brown, 5 “was that associated with their 
rule at Delhi, the capital city and the centre of the imperial power.” 
His designation of the monuments of the first group as forming the 
‘Delhi’ or ‘Imperial’ style seems to be more appropriate. The 
style began with the establishment of Islamic rule at Delhi about 
the close of the twelfth century and continued for approximately 
three centuries and a half till the foundation of Mughul rule by 
Babur in A.D. 1526. With the gradual decline and disintegration of 
the Delhi Sultanate, the outlying provinces shook off the allegiance 
of Delhi and declared their independence. Many of these provinces, 
when they asserted autonomy, developed architectural modes of 
their own, each having a certain amount of individuality. These 
regional modes, exhibited by the buildings of the second group, col¬ 
lectively constituted the ‘Provincial’ styles, and covered a period 
which was contemporary, partly with the Delhi style, and partly 
with the Mughul. 

II. DELHI OR IMPERIAL STYLE 
A. Buildings of the Mamluk and the Khalji dynasties 

After the second battle of Tarain, Qutb-ud~dln Aibak, a gene¬ 
ral of Muhammad Ghuri, occupied Delhi and established his govern¬ 
ment at the citadel known as Qil‘a-i-Riai Pithaura. This was the 
first of the ‘Seven cities’ of Delhi which the Islamic rulers succes¬ 
sively built in this ancient metropolitan site. Delhi, which conti¬ 
nued to be the seat and symbol of imperial power till the last days 
of the Mughuls, contains a series of noble monuments, of which the 
earliest and one of the most remarkable is the Quwwat-ul-Islam 
mosque, 6 erected by Qutb-ud-dm at Qil‘a-i-Rai Pithaura to comme¬ 
morate the capture of Delhi and dedicated to the might of Islam. It 
now stands in an extremely dilapidated state. It consisted of an 
open quadrangular court encompassed by colonnades (Fig. 1) of 
which the western formed the prayer chamber, i.e. the sanctuary 
proper. It had gateways set on the other three sides, the main 
entrance on the east being domed. The northern and the southern 
colonnades had each three rows of columns, the eastern, four, and 
the western, five. The colonnades were correspondingly divided into 
two, three, and four aisles. At each extremity of the colonnades, 
at their junction with one another, there was a storeyed pavilion. 
The columns, the architraves, the ceilings, etc., are all richly carved, 
and, when entire, the design was not an unimpressive one. 

The mode of erection of this mosque may be said to have been 
characteristic of the beginnings of Islamic architecture in India. It 


665 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


actually stands on the site of an older temple, and it has already 
been indicated how Indian temples with colonnaded courts lent 
themselves easily for conversion into Muslim mosques. All that was 
necessary was to remove the sanctuary from the centre of the court, 
and to erect on the west side a wall with mihrdbs or prayer niches. 
A similar procedure was adopted in the building of the Quwwat-ub 
Islam mosque. Half of the plinth on which it stands represents in 
fact the basement of an earlier temple. But as the mosque was 
designed on a much bigger scale, the existing basement had to be 
enlarged to nearly double its original size. The enormous work, 
entailed by this enlargement, necessitated the desecration and dis¬ 
mantling of as many as twenty-seven other temples in the vicinity, 
and the materials, including those of the one on the site, were re¬ 
assembled to form this single mosque. There is an inscription which 
states this fact plainly and blandly, and every part of the building, 
such as the walls, columns, capitals, architraves, ceilings, etc., fully 
bears this out. “It is no wonder”, says Percy Brown, 7 “that the 
interior structure of the Qutb mosque, though an assemblage of 
elegantly carved stonework, had more the character of an archaeo¬ 
logical miscellany than a considered work of architecture.” He 
calls it “mainly a patchwork of older materials, beautiful in detail, 
.... .but as a whole a confused and somewhat incongruous 
improvisation. 5 ’ 

More incongruous still is the im-Isiamic appearance of the re¬ 
assembled building, singly, as well as collectively. Indeed, except 
for the mihrdbs in the sanctuary wall (and this, too, is now nearly 
gone), there is hardly a feature in this oldest existing mosque of im> 
portance to demonstrate its Islamic character. It presented, rather, 
an essentially Hindu appearance, whether from within or from with¬ 
out. It is doubtful whether a design, so alien to Islamic tradition, 
could be acceptable to the orthodox Muslim. It was, in all likeli¬ 
hood, to obviate this drawback that within two years of its construc¬ 
tion a huge screen of arches (wAiqsura) , essentially an Islamic sym¬ 
bol, was thrown across the entire front of the western colonnade, 
i.e. the prayer chamber proper. It consists of a huge wall of stone 
masonry, over fifty feet in height in the middle, and pierced by 
five arched openings—a lofty central arch flanked on each side by 
two smaller ones, the latter once supporting a clerestory of lesser 
arches (Fig. 2). As the mode of construction indicates, this 
huge arched fagade was also evidently the work of Indian builders. 
Though added to give the mosque an Islamic appearance, the 
arches were built in oversailing courses, a specifically Indian mode, 
instead of by the process of radiating voussoirs, the correct principle 


666 


ART 


of building up an arch, with which the Islamic builders had been 
familiar long before the establishment of Muslim rule in India, 
The ogee shape of the arches also illustrates an Indian design. It 
appears that the Indian builders, engaged in the construction of 
this facade, had no comprehension of the real needs of their Islamic 
masters and followed their own traditional system and design. 

As an individual work this expansive facade is itself an im¬ 
pressive production. The bold lineaments of this huge mass have 
been emphasized by exquisitely chiselled decorative bands framing 
the arches. The ogee points of the arches impart to the facade a 
certain appearance of lightness, “necessary in such a massive 
volume.” In the decorative patterns one may recognize an inter¬ 
mixture of Hindu as well as Islamic ideals. The rich floral devices 
with their curly and sinuous tendrils are definitely reproductions of 
Hindu motifs, while the Tughra inscriptions with their straight lines 
are emphatically Islamic in conception (Fig. 3). The execution, too, 
is superb and flawless. As Marshall 8 observes: “No doubt it was a 
Muslim calligraphist who set out the scheme and penned in the 
texts, but it was only an Indian brain that could have devised such 
a wealth of ornament, and only Indian hands that could have carved 
it to such perfection.” 

In spite of the massive strength and elegant carvings the fagade 
is obviously a failure architecturally. It does not fit in with the 
scheme of the mosque. To auote Marshall 9 again: “It is too obvious- 
iy an afterthought, not an integral, organic part of the structure: 
too vast and over-powering to harmonise with the relatively low 
colonnades of the courtyard, and still more out of keeping with the 
slight elegant pillars of the hall behind.” 

The Quwwat-ui-Islam mosque grew in size and dimensions with 
the gradual increase of the congregation of the faithful at Delhi. 
Subsequent monarchs enlarged it from time to time. The original 
mosque remained, however, the nucleus, and later enlargements and 
additions were made with the original mosque as the focal point. 
In such additions and enlargements one may closely follow the 
course of the early phase of Indo-Islamic architecture and its deve¬ 
lopment. In A.D. 1230, Sultan Iltutmish enlarged the mosque 
quadrangle to more than double its size. His project involved addi¬ 
tion to the mosque enclosure on the north, south and east, together 
with the extension of the prayer chamber and the huge arched 
screen in front by throwing out wings on the north and south. Fresh 
masonry was specially quarried for purposes of these extensions, 
and this fact may possibly signify the paucity of older materials. 
The colonnades in these extensions were but simpler replicas of 


667 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


those of the previous scheme, and retained essentially their Hindu 
appearance. The extended wings of the screen reproduce also the 
scheme of the previous work, and the arches in the extensions were 
also put up in oversailing courses, as in the indigenous mode. Yet, 
taken collectively, there may be recognized a subtle difference in 
the effect produced by the later work. Marshall 10 recognizes in this 
a greater assertion of Muslim ideas in the building tradition at Delhi, 
and observes “that the new work was fundamentally Islamic in 
character and manifestly designed, if not executed, by Muslim 
craftsmen.” “In Qutb-ud-din’s screen”, he continues, “the inscrip¬ 
tions we re the only part of the surface ornament which were 
Muhammadan; all the rest was Indian and modelled with true Indian 
feeling for plastic form. In Xltutmish’s work, on the other hand, 
the reliefs are flat and lifeless, stencilled as it were on the surface 
of the stone, and their formal patterns are identical with those found 
on contemporary Muslim monuments in other countries.” Marshall 
seems to be justified in holding that the reaction against Indian ele¬ 
ments is clearly noticeable in these extensions. 

‘Ala-ud-dln Khalji was the last of the Delhi Sultans to enlarge 
the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque. He projected a huge extension of 
the mosque enclosure on the east and the north. The prayer chamber 
was also added to by throwing a wing towards the north. He also 
intended to erect within the enlarged court on the north a minar 
which, if completed, would surely have surpassed the Qutb Minar 
in dimension and height. It is unfortunate that the death of the 
Sultan put an end to his grandiose schemes. 

Just outside the enclosure of the original Quwwat-ul-Islam 
mosque on the south, and within the enlarged court of Iltutmish’s 
mosque, stands the Qutb Minar, which appears to have been intend¬ 
ed as a ma’zina or tower from which the Mu’azzin could summon the 
faithful to prayer. From the various inscriptions in situ it appears 
that Qutb-ud-din began the construction of the minar when he was 
the viceroy at Delhi. He could finish only up to the first storey, 
and it was Iltutmish who finally completed it. As originally design¬ 
ed, it rose up to a height of 225 feet, tapering as it went up, and 
consisted of four storeys. 

In the reign of Firuz Tughluq, the minar was struck by 
lightning, and the fourth storey, that was damaged thereby, was 
replaced by two smaller ones, its height being thus raised to 234 feet. 
In A.D. 1503, during the reign of Sikandar Lodi, the minar is said 
to have been restored again and its upper storeys repaired; but the 
nature of the work, carried out on that occasion, cannot be easily 
determined. 


668 


ART 


As it now stands, the minar (Fig. 4) consists of five storeys, 
separated from one another by richly decorated balconies supported 
on highly ornate stalactite alcoves. The surface is further em¬ 
bellished by vertical flutings and horizontal bands of inscriptions 
richly interwoven with intricate foliated designs. The vertical 
flutings in the ground storey are alternately round and angular, 
those of the second only round, and those of the third angular only. 
The two uppermost storeys are plainly circular in design. The 
stalactite alcoves, apart from their utilitarian purpose, furnish also 
a rich decorative scheme. Up to the third storey the tower was 
built of grey quartzite faced with rich red sandstone, the two upper 
storeys being of red sandstone faced with marble. 

Because of the appearance in the minar of certain short Nagari 
inscriptions, it is sometimes believed that the tower was essentially 
of Hindu origin. The Muslims, according to this view, were merely 
responsible for recarving the outer surfaces. Such a view, however, 
does not seem to be probable. There are sufficient evidences to indi¬ 
cate that the stones bearing Nagari records might have come from 
some older structures. “As a fact”, observes Marshall, “the whole 
conception of the minar and almost every detail of its construction 
and ornamentation is essentially Islamic. Towers of this kind were 
unknown to the Indians, but to the Muhammadans they had long 
been familiar, whether as ma’zinas attached to mosque or as free¬ 
standing towers like those at Ghazni. Equally distinctive also of 
Muslim art are the calligraphic inscriptions and the elaborate 
stalactite corbelling beneath the balconies, both of which can be 
traced back to kindred features in the antecedent architecture of 
Western Asia and Egypt.” 11 It should be noted in this connection 
that the stellar shape of the Ghazni tower closely resembles that of 
the third storey of the Qutb Minar, of which the bottom storey is 
slightly elaborated—stellar flutings alternating with rounded ones. 
The effect produced by this massive structure is overwhelmingly 
impressive. Fergusson regarded the Qutb Minar as the most perfect 
example of a tower known to exist anywhere in the world. 12 Mar¬ 
shall’s concluding observations are also worth quoting in this con¬ 
nection: “Nothing, certainly, could be more imposing or more fitting¬ 
ly symbolic of Muslim power than this stern and stupendous fabric; 
nor could anything be more exquisite than its rich but restrained 
carvings. r]3 

The celebrated mosque at Ajmer (Figs. 5 and 7), known as 
Adhai-din-ka-Jhompra, 14 erected a little later than Qufb-ud-dm’s 
mosque at Delhi, resembles the Delhi prototype in style as well as 
in construction. Being more than double in size, the several consti- 


6(39 



THE DELHI SULTANATE 


tuent parts of the Ajmer mosque are correspondingly more spacious 
and dignified. The planning of the prayer chamber in the Qutb 
mosque at Delhi was, more or less, on make-shift lines, and the 
colonnades therein too constricted, and the pillars too low and 
crowded. The Ajmer mosque was a more organized composition; 
apparently the experiences gained in the construction of the earlier 
building had been put to use. Instead of a number of narrow aisles 
as at Delhi, a single broad aisle surrounds the Ajmer quadrangle, 
and the domes and pillars in the prayer chamber, as well as in 
the other three colonnades, are strictly uniform and symmetrical 
in arrangement. Each of the mosques represents, more or less, a 
re-assemblage of the spoils of the earlier buildings. At Ajmer, how¬ 
ever, the architect evinced a better sense of composition, no doubt 
as the result of previous experience, and created, out of materials 
of strange and apparently unfamiliar forms, a prayer hall of solemn 
and impressive beauty. The exquisite mihmb in white marble, set 
in the back wall of the sanctuary, is a notable feature of this mosque, 
while the circular bastions, fluted and banded as in the Qutb Minar, 
at the two corners of the eastern facade, add to the beauty of the 
entire design. Qutb-ud-dm had built this mosque about A.D. 1200. 
Iltutmish subsequently beautified it with an arched facade in front 
of the prayer chamber. It is essentially a copy of the earlier screen 
at Delhi, with, however, two minarets over the parapet of the central 
archway, one on each side. The proportions between this facade and 
the prayer chamber behind are more pleasing; the engrailed arches 
flanking the central one represent a refreshing novelty; the deco¬ 
rative patterns are admirable of their kind, and their workmanship 
is faultless. Yet, with all its merits the Ajmer screen lacked the 
delicate and subtle beauty of Qutb-ud-dln’s screen at Delhi. Magni¬ 
ficent as it was, it is a perfect example of mathematical precision 
and technical skill; but there are many features in if that sufficiently 
betray a certain limitation on the part of the designer in respect 
of imagination as well as of artistic vision; on no account can it be 
regarded as an artistic triumph. 

At Malkapur, at a distance of about three miles from the Qutb, 
stands the Sultan Ghlari 15 (Fig. 6) which Iltutmish built in A.D. 1231- 
32 as the mausoleum of his eldest son, Nasir-ud-din Mahmud. Situat¬ 
ed at an isolated position, it was built in the manner of a fortified 
square enclosure, with the cenotaph accommodated within a flat- 
roofed underground chamber in the centre of the walled court. 
There are, therefore, good reasons for considering it to be the earli¬ 
est example of a monumental tomb in India. The central chamber 
is octagonal in shape and its top rises above the level of the court. 


670 


ART 


The interior is approached by a narrow stairway communicating 
with a small door in one of the sides of the octagon. This scheme 
is contained within substantial cloisters, the whole being raised over 
a lofty plinth. On the east there is a massive portal projecting 
beyond the line of the enclosure wall, the latter having round taper¬ 
ing bastions at the four corners. Built of grey granite, the exterior 
has a stern and solid appearance, in spite of the relief lent by arched 
openings in the walls and the bastions. The interior, however, has 
a calm and charming effect, because of its sober design, as well as 
on account of the use of marble in the exterior facing of the tomb 
chamber and in the colonnades. The massive portal leads to a 
pillared portico of pleasing design (Fig. 10), while along the western 
cloister is provided a small mosque sanctuary with a domed central 
nave containing a mihrdb of an elegantly shaped foliated arch, and 
with colonnades extending from side to side. The description in 
the Futuhdi-i-Firuz Shdlzi, that Firuz Shiah restored some fallen 
pillars and four towers in the mausoleum of Iltutmish, seems to 
apply to this monument, and not to the tomb of Iltutmish which 
will be discussed presently. Except for the mihrdb in the mosque 
sanctuary in the western cloister, every part of the building seems 
to be of Hindu extraction, and there is a view that the tomb chamber 
itself represented originally a Hindu edifice. While doubts may be 
entertained on this point, it is clear that the pillars, brackets, archi¬ 
traves, the decorative motifs, the arches, and even the domed ceiling 
of the mosque are of Hindu design and workmanship. The building 
also seems to be an assemblage of earlier materials; in its finished 
state it reveals an exquisite sense of grouping and architectural com¬ 
position. 

Behind the northern range of Iltutmish’s extension of the Qutb 
mosque stands a single compact chamber (Fig. 9), of less than 30 
feet side, which has been said to be the mausoleum of the emperor. 16 
It is built of red sandstone within and grey quartzite without, the 
exterior surface being further relieved by red sandstone. On the 
north, south, and east, there are arched entrances, while on the west 
there is a mihrdb , flanked by two smaller ones. The chamber was 
covered by a low domical roof (now fallen down), supported on 
squinch arches thrown across the corners. The arched entrances 
as well as the squinches were built up in oversailing courses. 
Though simple and unpretentious, this mausoleum is one of the 
most ornate monuments of early Indo-Islamic art. The ornamenta¬ 
tion on the outside is comparatively sparse and consists of bands of

in Naskh, Tughra and Kufic characters, or with floral arabesques 
and geometric patterns of a bewildering variety, and further relieved 
by insertions of white marble. The patterns were predominantly 
Islamic in character, and this fact may indicate a reaction against 
Indian tradition which seems to be gradually making itself manifest. 
The craftsmen, employed in the execution of the ornamentation, 
however, seem to be Indian, and a certain degree of inaptness, which 
Fergusson 17 notices in the details, might have been due to the fact 
that they were working with designs with which they were not fami¬ 
liar. So far as the effect is concerned, there is a sense of overdoing, 
and the style that it represents, though ornate, and in a manner anti¬ 
cipating the subsequent Khalji mode, may be said to be vacillating 
and lifeless. 

To the period of Iltutmish may also be assigned certain other 
structures in the outlying districts, such as the Hauz-i-Shamsi, the 
Shamsi-Idgah and the Jdmi c Masjid at Badaun 18 (U.P.), and the 
Atarkin-ka-Darwaza at Nagaur 19 (Jodhpur). In subsequent periods 
they have undergone successive restorations which have obliterated, 
to a very large extent, the nature and character of the original monu¬ 
ments. 19 

After the death of Iltutmish, the Delhi Sultanate fell on evil 
days, as noted above, until Balban brought some order into the chaos 
that had set in. To this period belongs a monument which provides 
a notable landmark in the development of Indo-Islamic architectural 
style. This is the tomb of Balban 20 which stands in a ruined and 
dilapidated condition in the south-east quarter of the QiTa-i-Rai 
Pithaura. It consists of a square chamber of 38 feet side, covered 
by a dome, with an arched doorway on each of its four sides, and a 
smaller chamber on the east and west. Composed of coarse masonry, 
whatever decoration there was has now vanished. But the import- 
ance of the building, as Percy Brown 21 recognizes, is not in what 
it is, but in what it signifies. Every arch in this building is put 
together, not by horizontal oversailing courses in keeping with the 
indigenous mode, as has been done in the previous buildings, but by 
means of radiating voussoirs, a fact which is of more than ordinary 
significance. Such an innovation, apart from its intellectual import, 
represents a clear and definite advance in structural practice. 

With the accession of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khalji to the throne of Delhi 
(A.D. 1298), the torpor into which the art of building had fallen 
seems to be broken. With his reign we reach a decisive phase in the 
history of Indo-Islamic architectural style. This forceful and re¬ 
lentless monarch had vast and ambitious architectural schemes. One 
of these, as noted above, was his scheme of erecting an immense con- 


672 


ART 


gregationai mosque at the Qutb, including within its perimeter the 
two mosques previously built. 21a The death of the monarch in A.D. 
1316 put an end to his ambitious scheme at a relatively early stage 
of construction. The foundations and the main walls of this vast 
extension may still be seen, mostly up to the height of the plinth; 
while the huge inner core of the projected minar, carried up to a 
height of about 75 feet, gives some idea of the architectural aspi¬ 
rations of this despotic ruler. 

Of this vast project one relatively small component had, how¬ 
ever, been completed. This is known as the ‘Alai Darwaza 22 after 
the name of its royal builder, and represents the southern entrance 
hall to his enlarged court in the east (Fig. 8). As Marshall 23 says, 
the ‘Alai Darwaza “is one of the most treasured gems of Islamic 
architecture 5 ’. According to an inscription on the building, it was 
built in A.D. 1310-11 and consists of a square hall covered by a 
dome. It has arched doorways, one on each of its four sides. It 
stands on a high plinth the sides of which are elegantly decorated 
by bands of ornament. It is built of red sandstone, but the surface 
is picked out by white marble defining the architectural lineaments, 
and further adorned by bands of calligraphic inscriptions and deco¬ 
rative patterns. On either side of the central arched passage the 
surface of each wall is divided into two stages, each stage being 
further sub-divided into vertical rectangular panels. Such panels 
in the lower stage are designed in the shape of arched openings 
with stone grilles. All ornamentations, including arabesques and 
decorative inscriptions, have been executed in a harmonious com¬ 
bination of red sandstone and marble, and they lend to the facades 
a polychrome effect of rich and superb design. Much of the beauty 
of the fagades is, again, due to the central arched entrances, as much 
for their refined curves as for their symmetrical proportions and 
manner and mode of decoration. The arches on the south, east and 
west are each of the pointed variety, of the shape technically known 
as the ‘horse-shoe’ or the ‘keel’. They are built of radiating vous- 
soirs of dressed stone and signify a definite advance on the previous 
practices. The decorative scheme of each arch enhances further the 
beauty of the fagade. The bands of inscriptions in white marble 
around the outlines, the fringe of spear-heads on the intrados, and 
the rectangular framework, with ornamental patterns and inscrip¬ 
tions in white marble, skilfully balance the structural as well as the 
plastic scheme of the whole. The northern fagade, however, shows 
a deviation from the above architectural composition that charac¬ 
terizes the other three. The portico, originally fronting the entrance 
on this side, has now gone. The arch in this opening is not pointed 

673 


D. S.«48 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


like the other three, but semi-circular with a trefoil in its outline. 
This fagade is also elaborately patterned, and some scholars recog¬ 
nize in its scheme of embellishment a tone different from that of the 
other three. 

No less magnificent is the interior arrangement of the hall which 
is decorated with a diaper pattern of unrivalled excellence in low 
relief. The mode, by which the square of the hall is transformed 
into an octagon to support the circular base of the dome, is appro¬ 
priate and at the same time elegant. A series of squinches of pointed 
shape, one recessed within another, in the upper section of each 
angle of the hall, changes the square into an octagon, and next the 
octagon into the circle of the dome with an intervening sixteen-sided 
shaft formed by a bracket at each end of the octagon. Thus the load 
of the dome has been gracefully and competently conveyed to the 
ground,—from the circle to the sixteen-sided shaft, from the latter 
to the octagon, and finally from the octagon to the walls forming the 
square. The shape of the squinches accords perfectly with the 
pointed openings in the fagades, and being put up in the principle of 
radiating voussoirs, they are in every respect singularly practical. 

In the composition of the ‘Alai Darwaza it is easy to discern the 
marks of mature architectural style with distinct evidence of an ex¬ 
pert direction and intelligent supervision. It is not unlikely that 
some extraneous influence, connected with a developed architectural 
style in Western Asia (Percy Brown 24 would ascribe it to that of the 
Seljuk Turks), has something to do with this marked progress in 
Indo-Muslim building art. But the chief characteristic of this 
notable monument, as Percy Brown recognizes, “and one on which 
much of its beauty depends, is that ... it embodies many purely indi¬ 
genous features, as throughout its fabric there runs the Indian man¬ 
ner, sometimes in the form of a mere border, at others comprising 
considerable parts of the pattern. It is the skilful fusion of the best 
of the two modes that has produced in this building such an out¬ 
standing work of art.” The early phase of Indo-Muslim archi¬ 
tectural style reaches its perfection when the indigenous workmen 
had learnt to fit their exquisite style of embellishment to the 
forms dictated by their alien masters, and this is clearly manifested 
in this moderate-sized building, in its every feature, whether struc¬ 
tural or decorative. Eminent critics have bestowed unstinted praise 
on this small but exquisite monument. “Nothing so complete”, says 
Fergusson, 25 “had been done before, nothing so ornate was attempted 
by them (the Delhi Sultans) afterwards.” Marshall’s observations 
are also worth quoting in this connection: “Seen at a distance its 
well-proportioned lineaments are accentuated by the alternating red 


674 


ART 


and white colour of its walls; and an added dignity is given by the 
high plinth on which it stands. At closer range, the harmony of form 
and colour is enhanced by the wealth of lace-like decorations graven 
on every square foot of its exterior walls. Then, as one passes into 
the hall, this effect of warm sumptuous beauty gives place to one of 
quiet solemnity, to which every feature of the interior seems to con¬ 
tribute: the subdued red of the sandstone, the stateliness of the 
portals, the plain expanse of dome, the shapely horse-shoe arches 
that support it, and the bold geometric patterning of walls and 
window screens. The key-notes of this building are its perfect 
symmetry and the structural propriety of all its parts.” 26 There is 
no doubt that the ‘Alai Darwaza represents the flowering of the style 
in unprecedented splendour and magnificence. It is only a part of 
‘ Ala-ud-dm’s grand architectural project at the Qutb which, if com¬ 
pleted, would surely have been one of the greatest artistic achieve¬ 
ments produced under Islamic rule in India. 

‘Ala-ud-dm’s architectural projects included also the found¬ 
ation of the new city of Siri, 27 the second of the ‘seven cities’ of Delhi. 
It lay to the north of the Qutb and was begun about A.D. 1303 to 
protect, it is said, the evergrowing population of the capital from the 
Mongol menace. Within the new city he also erected a palace of 
thousand pillars, but this has completely fallen into ruins. The only 
vestiges of the new city that now remain are some fragments of the 
encircling walls. “But even these few remnants, with their round 
and tapering bastions, their lines of loopholes, their flame-shaped 
battlements inscribed with the Kalima, and their inner berm sup¬ 
ported on an arched gallery”, 28 supply interesting information re¬ 
garding the military architecture of the period. At the western 
extremity of the new city, ‘Ala-ud-dln built also a magnificent tank 
covering an area of nearly 70 acres. It was known as Hauz-i-‘AlaI 
or Hauz-i-Khas tank. It was on its banks that Timur encamped 
after his victory over the Delhi troops. It will be referred to again 
in connection with the buildings of Firuz Shah Tughluq who carried 
on extensive repairs to the tank. 

The fine Jama‘at Khana mosque 29 in the squalid environment 
of the Dargah of Nizam-ud-din Auliya betrays obvious affinities with 
the Khaljl tradition, and was very probably built towards the close 
of ‘Ala-ud-dm’s reign. Marshall 30 described it as the earliest 
example of a mosque in India built wholly in conformity with Isla¬ 
mic ideas and with materials specially quarried for the purpose. 
Built of red sandstone, it has three compartments adjoining one 
another,—the middle one being square and the side ones oblong in 
shape,—each approached through a broad arched entrance in the 


675 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


fagade. The arches are of the pointed variety and fundamentally 
resemble those of the ‘Alai Darwaza. All the arches are framed 
by wide bands of inscriptions above, and embellished by fringes of 
spear-heads on the intrados, again, generally in the manner that we 
find in the ‘Alai Darwaza. The central compartment, approximately 
of the same dimensions as those of the gateway hall, is roofed by a 
single dome. The manner of transition from the square to the octa¬ 
gon is also the same, but a certain advance may be recognized in the 
provision of an intervening triforium between the octagon and the 
circle of the dome. Around the base the dome has eight arched re¬ 
cesses, alternately closed and pierced through the thickness of the 
wall. The adjoining compartments are each divided in their middle 
by a double-arched screen. Each of these compartments is covered 
by two small domes, the transition from the square to the octagon 
being made, not by squinches, but by triangular pendentives at the 
corners. The walls of these compartments are made of plastered 
rubble, and on this account it has been suggested that they were built 
later than the central component. But the homogeneous treatment 
of the entire fagade renders such a view rather improbable. The 
‘Alai Darwaza and the Jama‘at Khana mosque are fundamentally of 
an identical style. Percy Brown, 31 however, recognizes a different 
note in the latter which he explains by stating that, due to the dis¬ 
orders that clouded the closing years of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl, the style, 
as expressed in the ‘Alai Darwaza was losing its forcefulness. The 
Ukha masjid at Bayana 32 (Bharatpur), built by Qutb-ud-dln Muba¬ 
rak, the last of the Khaljl rulers, represents a provincial version of 
the imperial style. Situated at a distance from the capital, it betrays 
obvious signs of weakness, and illustrates in a striking manner the 
rapid disintegration of the high-water mark of the style attained 
during the time of ‘Ala-ud-dln Khaljl. 


B. Buildings of the Tughluqs 

In the next regime, that of the Tughluqs, a distinct change is 
perceptible in the spirit and tone of architecture. In marked con¬ 
trast to the rich and elaborate ornamental style of the Khaljl build¬ 
ings, those of the Tughluqs are characterized by a stark simplicity of 
design bordering almost on puritanical severity. Instead of the 
lavish wealth of ornamental detail that distinguished the first phase 
of the Indo-Islamic art, the Tughluq builders seem to rely, to a far 
greater degree, on the effects of lineaments and masses, rather than 
on surface treatment. The result is the appearance of a distinctive 
building style, chaste and sober, no doubt, but at the same time be¬ 
traying a certain poverty of imagination and lack of plastic sense. 


676 


ART 


The founder of the dynasty, the stern old warrior Ghiyas-ud-dln 
Tughluq, built to the east of the Qutb area the city of Tughluqabad, 33 
the third of the ‘seven cities’ of Delhi. Irregular in outline, in accord¬ 
ance with the shape of the rocky eminence on which it stood, it con¬ 
sisted roughly of a quadrangle of 2,200 yards each side. Only the 
remnants of the immense circuit walls are now discernible. These 
were built of Cyclopean masonry of ponderous dimensions, and had 
heavily battered sides and battlemented parapets. At regular inter¬ 
vals there were massive splayed-out bastions, sometimes rising in 
more than one storey, wide gateways flanked by lofty portals, and 
tiers upon tiers of loop-holes or ovlets for the discharge of missiles. 
Within was a citadel, which was a fortress and a palace combined, 
having its double or triple lines of defence. Everything, however, 
is now a complex mass of shapeless ruin, and nothing remains of 
the great palace of Ghiyas-ud-dm, built, as Ibn Batutah says, “of 
golden bricks which, when the Sun rose, shone so dazzlingly that 
no one could gaze at it steadily.” Nevertheless, the ruins are im¬ 
mensely impressive. The colossal bulks of broken masonry, devoid 
of any adornment, towering high with emphatic batter, lend to the 
entire mass the stern dignity of a practical stronghold. The appear¬ 
ance of impregnability is, however, a false one, as the massive forti¬ 
fications are in reality built of a loose core of rubble faced with 
ashlar. The poor construction was, no doubt, responsible for the 
heavy damage that the city had sustained in course of the centuries. 

Joined to the city of Tughluqabad by an elevated causeway 
lies the mausoleum of Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq. 34 It is in the form 
of a miniature fortress of an irregular pentagonal shape, with a 
battlemented sloping wall having an immense spreading bastion at 
each corner (Fig. 12). The mausoleum building is placed diagonally 
at the widest part of the pentangular court, and is built of red sand¬ 
stone with inlays of bands and panels of marble above the arch¬ 
springs. The dome surmounting the mausoleum chamber is made 
entirely of marble. The marble inlays consist of a broad band 
running all around the building in a line with the arch-springs, and 
similar bands outlining the arches, each again within a rectangular 
framing together with a second band at the top. On either side ap¬ 
pear further rectangular marble panels while at the top runs a 
narrow marble band all around. The marble inlays, together with 
spear-head fringes of the arches, recall the decorative scheme of the 
‘Alai Darwaza. But, at the same time, the Tughluq building has 
certain strongly marked individualities. On the exterior the walls 
rise upward with a pronounced batter, and this is in keeping with 
the new tradition first noticed in the walls of the city of Tughluqabad. 


677 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The middle of each side is slightly set forward, and accommodates 
a pointed arch, there being four such on the four sides. Three of 
these are entrance archways, while the fourth, i.e. the one on the 
west, is closed to contain a mihrab . In the composition of the arch¬ 
ways a notable feature is introduced by the imposition of a lintel 
across the base of each arch. Such a combination of the two princi¬ 
ples of support—the arcuate and the trabeate—-in the composition 
of an opening is rather an unusual feature, and has, perhaps, to be 
explained as “the compounding of the structural conventions” of the 
two communities, the Islamic and the Hindu. The process may be 
regarded as irrational and redundant. In a way, it marks a stage 
in the fusion of the two architectural traditions, and in the subse¬ 
quent periods the Indian builders achieved through this process, and 
with the addition of a bracket under the lintel, a notable artistic 
effect. The sloping walls terminate in low battlements, rather an 
ineffective feature on account of their being unduly small. The 
dome rests on an octagonal drum, supported on squinches in the 
interior, and is crowned by an amalaka and kalasa, reproducing the 
usual pinnacle of a Hindu temple. 

The fortress-like composition of the tomb reflects the stern and 
indomitable character of the ruler whose remains lie buried here. 
The harsh square shape and the sturdy proportions, together with 
the battering walls, lend to the building an appearance of stiength 
and solidity with which has been combined an effect of solemn and 
sober grandeur because of the inlays of marble, and especially by 
the glistening white of the dome. The sloping pilasters in the arch¬ 
ways, the rather weak projection of the central bays, the small mer¬ 
lons, etc., constitute certain shortcomings in the design and could 
easily have been improved upon. In spite of these, however, the 
building appears to have been a felicitous production of the age, 
having a certain robust dignity of its own. 

Muhammad bin Tughluq, Ghiyas-ud-din’s son and successor, is 
known to have also inaugurated a number of building projects. The 
foundation of the small fortress of Adilabad is attributed to him. It 
adjoins the city of Tughluqabad and is but a reproduction of the 
larger city on a smaller scale. Muhammad also built the fourth city 
of Delhi which he called by the ambitious name of Jahanpanah 35 
(the World Refuge). It was made by linking up the first and the 
second cities of Delhi by walls of huge thickness (about 12 yards), 
but rather poorly built of rough rubble set in lime. Few vestiges 
of the fortifications now remain. The buildings within are also 
nearly all gone. Among the present remains mention should be 
made of Sathpalah-bund and the Bijai-Mandal. The former is a 


678 



ART 


double-storeyed bridge of seven spans, with supplementary arches 
and a tower at each end, which was meant for regulating the supply 
of water drawn from a lake within the city. The Bijai-Mandal was 
a lofty tower-like structure of terraced elevation, possibly a part of 
the palace complex. It was built of sloping walls, in conformity 
with the prevailing fashion introduced in the previous reign, and the 
few arches that remain are of the pointed horse-shoe shape, rather 
indifferent reproductions of the Khaljl prototypes. A certain ad¬ 
vance in the structural procedure is recognized in the use of inter¬ 
secting vaults. Another building, a nameless tomb in the vicinity 
of the Bijai-Mandal, is also a noteworthy production of the age for 
its fine proportions and elegant form. 

Firuz Shah, the third of the Tughluq line, was a passionate lover 
and an indefatigable patron of building art. 36 Reference has been 
made above 37 to his innumerable public works, which included 
cities, forts, palaces, mosques, tombs and other edifices. His most 
important scheme was the foundation of the fifth city of Delhi, 
called after him Flruzabad. 38 Within the city he built the palace- 
fort, known as Kotla Firuz Shah, which now stands in a derelict 
condition. 

It is, however, noteworthy, that only very cheap material were 
used in the constructions, due, perhaps, to the unsettled condition of 
the time caused by the vagaries and rebellions of the late regime. 
The buildings of Firuz Tughluq, though strong and virile in appear¬ 
ance like those of the first Tughluq, therefore generally fail to create 
any impression because of a certain dullness and monotony. 

Marshall’s observations regarding the character of the FIruzian 
style deserves to be quoted for a general idea of the state of archi¬ 
tecture of the period. “The virtues of this architecture reside in 
its vigour and straightforwardness; in its simple broad effects; and 
in the purposefulness with which it evolved new structural fea¬ 
tures or adapted old ones to its needs—the multi-domed roofing, for 
example, or the tapering minaret-like buttresses at the quoins. Its 
faults are seen in the monotonous reiteration of these self-same 
features, in the prosaic nakedness of its ideas, and in the dearth of 
everything that might make for picturesque charm or elegance.” 39 

According to the description of Shams-i-Siraj ‘Aflf, the city of 
Flruzabad lay between the ridge on the north and Hauz-i-Khas on 
the south, and had nine mosques, of which eight were public, three 
palaces, and a number of hunting boxes. This description, how¬ 
ever, seems to be exaggerated. Of the monuments that remain, the 
most imposing is the Kotla Firuz Shah 40 or the palace-fortress 
situated on an extensive plain bordering the river Yamuna (Jamu- 


679 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


na). It occupies a quadrangle, approximately half a mile in length 
and a quarter in width, enclosed by tall battlemented walls with 
massive splayed-out bastions at regular intervals. The main en¬ 
trance was through a substantial gateway, projecting from the line 
of the wall and further protected by a curtain with a guard 
room. The palace was situated within a rectangular enclosure op¬ 
posite the main gateway of the Kotla. The rest of the area was 
divided into a number of square and rectangular courts accommodat¬ 
ing the various structures necessary in a self-contained palace 
stronghold. The two that deserve notice are the Jdmi e Masjid and 
a terraced pyramidal structure surmounted by a pillar of Asoka. The 
former was a large and imposing structure of the usual plan. It rose 
in two storeys with arcaded chambers on three sides of the ground 
floor, and cloisters, three aisles deep, around the open court of the 
mosque above. The other features of the building, as far as can be 
gathered, such as masonry of rubble and plaster, bare walls, multiple 
domes, squinch arches for their support, and battlemented parapets, 
are typical of the style of the period. 

At the Hauz-i-Khas, Firuz Shah built on the remains of an older 
structure of ‘Ala-ud-din Khaljl a college, much of which is now in 
ruins. It occupies the southern and eastern sides of the great lake, 
being two-storeyed on the lake front and one-storeyed behind. It 
consists of an extensive group of buildings, mostly arcades and colon¬ 
nades with square domed halls in between. A charming view of the 
group may be obtained from the lake front. In contrast to the pre¬ 
vailing severe mode, it has an exceptionally elegant appearance, 
particularly because of the happy and effective grouping of the 
different components. 

The mausoleum of Firuz Shah^i situated among the crumbling 
ruins of the college complex, is in a fairly good state of preservation. 
It is a square building with slightly battering walls, each side having 
a shallow projecting bay in the centre (Fig. 11). Two of these bays 
accommodate arched entrances, each framed within a rectangular re¬ 
cess. Across the base of the arch there is a lintel supported on heavy 
brackets, the beginnings of such a combination of two structural con¬ 
ventions being already noticed in the tomb of the first Tughluq. The 
walls terminate in parapets of small ornamental merlons. The low 
and slightly pointed dome rises on an octagonal drum with identical 
merlons around the base of the dome. The latter is supported in the 
interior on squinches at the four corners. The narrow marble 
cornices in the exterior, as well as certain arabesque ornamentations, 
both inside and out, were added in course of some repairs during 
the time of Sikandar Lodi. Even without these, the building has a 


680 


ART 


certain appearance of distinction because of its fine proportions and 
sober treatment and is characterized by a simple dignity and quiet 
unpretentiousness. 

The reign of Firuz Shah Tughluq is also important for the 
introduction of new architectural trends. Among these, one in 
respect of the tomb buildings remained the dominant style for 
nearly two centuries. The mausoleum of Khan-i-Jahan Tilangani, 42 
situated a little to the south of the Dargah of Nizam-ud-din, is an 
unostentatious building in itself; but it is of exceptional interest as 
illustrating a new design of tomb-structure. It is placed within a 
quadrangular court enclosed by strong walls with bastions at the 
corners,—a composition that is usual with fortress tombs. But the 
tomb building itself is of an unusual shape and design. Hitherto all 
mortuary buildings had been of square shape. The Tilangani tomb 
is, however, octagonal in form and represents a distinct departure 
from that prevailing at the imperial capital. It consists of an octa¬ 
gonal chamber covered by a dome and enclosed by a low arched 
corridor, also of octagonal shape. Each side of the octagon has 
three archways, i. e. twenty-four all round, and the roof is composed 
of twenty-four small domes which surround the large dome sur¬ 
mounting the mortuary chamber. Above the encompassing arches 
there runs a wide eave or chajja, which adds a new and at the same 
time useful element in the composition. Some scholars have 
stressed the resemblance in form between the Tilangani tomb and 
the celebrated Dome of the Rock at Jerusalem. But the former 
has some distinctive individualities, not only in the use of different 
materials but also in architectural treatment, and these impart to 
it an essentially Indian character. It is likely that the design of this 
tomb, instead of being derived from a far-distant prototype, was 
independently evolved in India, and that it was due to its being an 
initial experiment of this kind that it suffers from certain serious 
drawbacks. For instance, the domes, the central as well as the 
surrounding ones, are too low and squat, and the encompassing 
arches are too stunted to have any effect. Moreover, there may 
also be recognized a lack of proportions and harmonious integration 
of the different parts. Such drawbacks are inherent in experi¬ 
mental efforts with a new form and were removed in course of time. 
What is important is that the Tilangani tomb, in spite of its draw¬ 
backs, constitutes a definite landmark as initiating a pattern in tomb 
building which set the fashion for the subsequent centuries. 

The tomb of Tilangani was built by his son Khan-i-Jahan Jauna 
Shah, a noble man in the Court of Firuz Shah Tughluq. Jauna 
Shah is also credited with the erection of a number of mosques, two 


681 


THE DELHI / SULTANATE 


of which stand out among those of the period as exhibiting an 
arrangement that is not usually met with. Besides being an emi¬ 
nent patron of the building art, Jauna Shah thus seems to have 
entertained certain new and original ideas about it. Several 
mosques were built in and around Delhi during the latter part of the 
reign of Flruz Shah and the majority of them belong to one uniform 
style. They are of the usual plan and built mostly of rubble and 
plaster with pillars, architraves and brackets of granite. The boldly 
projecting entrance gateways remind one of the Sultan Gharl, while 
multi-domed roofs, tapering turrets, and the combination of arches 
with beams and brackets are characteristic of the architecture of 
the period. The Kail Masjid 43 near the Tilangani tomb and the 
Khirkl Masjid 44 at Jahanpanah, both attributed to Jauna Shah, 
though belonging to the prevailing style, present each an ex¬ 
ceptional feature in the fact that the quadrangle of the mosque 
enclosure, instead of being one open whole, is divided into four 
smaller courts by arcaded aisles crossing it at right angles, one join¬ 
ing the eastern entrance with the middle bay of the prayer chamber 
and the other linking up the northern and southern entrances 
(cf. Fig. 14). Such an arrangement is not quite in keeping with 
orthodox usage, and though it afforded protection to the congrega¬ 
tion of worshippers and, to a certain extent, relieved the monotony 
of the interior, it was not followed in other mosques. The Kalan 
Masjid 45 (Fig. 13) at Shahjahanabad, attributed also to Jauna Shah, is 
much of the same style, but without the division of the quadrangle 
into four smaller courts. The Kalan and the Khirkl are each raised 
over a basement (tali-khana ), much in the same manner that we find 
in the Jdmi e Masjid in the Kotla. 

Another building belonging to the closing years of the Tughluq 
regime is of certain interest as illustrating a movement for a revival 
of the more colourful style of the earlier epochs. This is the tomb 
of Kablr-ud-din Auliya, 46 a square building of red sandstone and 
marble with sloping sides, and is apparently a copy of the tomb of 
the first Tughluq. It appears that after the passing away of the 
puritanical Flruz, the builders exhibited again a sympathy for the 
more ornamental treatment of the earlier monuments. But the 
severe mode prevailing in the Flruzian period had, more or less, a 
deadening effect which the architects or the designers could hardly 
shake off. Further, in the general state of disintegration, the means 
and resources were also too limited to allow a recapture of the older 
spirit, much less an emulation of, or improvement upon, the earlier 
models. Hence, the experiment, instead of heralding any approach¬ 
ing resurgence, pointedly testifies to the utter decadence that had 
set in.

C. Buildings of the Sayyids and Lodls 

The invasion of Timur dealt the death blow to whatever was 
left of the imperial power of the Delhi Sultans. Their shrunken 
resources naturally precluded any ambitious architectural project, 
though the first two Sayyids permitted themselves the luxury of 
founding two cities, Khizrabad and Mubarakabad, named after them. 
These have been practically swept away, apparently because of their 
poor construction due to weak and limited financial conditions. 

The surviving monuments of the period are mostly funerary in 
character. The rulers as well as the people seem to have been in¬ 
terested in this form of monument only, and it is only these which 
they tried to build with a certain amount of care. At no other time, 
perhaps, says Percy Brown , 47 “has the tomb been more manifest in 
the consciousness of the people than during the rule of the Sayyids 
and Lodls.” On the desolate ruins of the imperial cities still stand 
scores of tombs—mute testimonies of how the people excelled in 
raising memorials to the dead. Delhi at this period seems to have 
been converted into a vast necropolis. 

The notable tombs of the period may be divided into two 
groups, according as they adopted the octagonal design of the 
Tilangani tomb, or the orthodox square type. Of the octagonal 
design we have, more or less, a continuous sequence of monuments 
that enable us to trace the development of the type from its incep¬ 
tion in the Tilangani tomb to its final culmination in the grand 
mausoleum of Sher Shah at Sasaram. The type remained popular 
also in the early Mughul phase, and two notable monuments of this 
design are known to have been erected during the reign of Akbar. 
The type thus remained in vogue for approximately two centuries, 
and the pattern reached a mature expression, stage by stage, every 
successive building representing an advance on the preceding one. 
Three of the identifiable royal tombs, belonging to this period, were 
of this pattern. They are the tombs of Mubarak Shah Sayyid, 
Muhammad Shah Sayyid, and Sikandar Lodi. The earliest of the 
series in the present phase, the tomb of Mubarak , 48 signifies a nota¬ 
ble improvement on its prototype, the Tilangani tomb. An appear¬ 
ance of greater elevation is imparted by raising the central dome 
substantially higher, by increasing the height of the surrounding 
corridor, and by adding sloping piers at its quoins. Further, the 
monotony of the upper part of the composition is relieved by the 
addition of pinnacles ( gul-dastas ) at the angles of the drum and of 
eight pillared kiosks, one on each side of the octagon around the 
central dome, roofed by a cupola. In spite of these improvements 
the composition seems to have been a matter of experiment still. 


683 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The chief defect consists in the failure of the builders to visualize 
the upper part of structure as being raised far above the eye level, 
leading thereby to a slightly stunted elevation and a foreshortening 
of the upper elements. 

In the tomb of Muhammad Shah Sayyid 49 (Fig. 15) may be re¬ 
cognized a further improvement of the design. The defects in 
elevation that were noticed in the two previous buildings were 
removed by increasing the heights of the drum, the central dome, as 
well as of the pillared kiosks. Along with an increase of the 
heights of the gul-dastas at the angles of the drum, a second range 
of such crestings were added to the corners of the arched corridor. 
Again, an increased batter of the piers at the quoins added greatly 
to the effect of elevation. Considered as a whole, the tomb of 
Muhammad Shah Sayyid represents a conception “satisfying in all 
its parts, well-proportioned, pleasingly set out, and fulfilling all its 
needs.” 50 

The next tomb of the series, that of Sikandar Lodi, 51 built in 
A.D. 1517, reproduces fundamentally the design of the tomb of 
Muhammad Shah Sayyid, with a notable variation, however, in the 
absence of the pillared kiosks surrounding the central dome. It is 
situated within an immense court, enclosed by a battlemented wall, 
with bastioned towers at the four corners, and an entrance gateway 
in the middle of the south side. This conception, according to 
Marshall, 52 anticipates, in a way, the more ornamental garden tombs 
of the Mughuls. In the tombs of the two Sayyids may be noticed 
the beginnings of the use of enamelled tiles for emphasizing the 
decorative features. The tomb of Sikandar Lodi is more lavish in 
the use of such tiles in a variety of colours, and the walls, both in¬ 
side and out, were richly adorned by elaborate patterns in choice 
colours. Apart from this ornamental treatment, his tomb intro¬ 
duces a new structural expedient of great significance which exer¬ 
cised a profound influence on the building art of the subsequent 
times. Up to this time it was the practice to erect the dome of one 
thickness of masonry, the elevation in the interior being nearly as 
high as in the exterior. When, with an increasing elevation of the 
building, it became necessary to place the dome on a higher level, the 
interior came to be stilted and disproportionately tall in relation to 
its width. In order to obviate this defect and to maintain the sym¬ 
metry between the exterior and interior dimensions, was devised 
the structural expedient, known as the ‘double dome’. It consisted 
of two separate shells of masonry, inner and outer, with a vacant 
space in between. The inner shell was placed at a level propor¬ 
tionate to the internal dimensions of the building, and the outer 


684 


ART 


corresponding to the external. The interior as well as the exterior 
dimensions thus came to be pleasingly balanced and integrated both 
horizontally and vertically, and the design, as a whole, was much 
improved thereby. This device had long been in use in different 
countries of Western Asia, and something like this had already 
been attempted in the tomb of Shihab-ud-dm Taj Khan of a slightly 
earlier date (A.D. 1501). In the tomb of Sikandar Lodi the device 
of the ‘double dome’ took a definite and concrete shape, and the first 
conscious application of this invests the building with a special in¬ 
terest and significance in view of the surprising results obtained by 
an effective use of this method in the Mughul buildings. 

The second group of tombs of the period, following the usual 
square design, exhibits, nevertheless, certain distinctive features in 
architectural treatment. The type consists of a square solid-look¬ 
ing building covered by a dome. In the treatment of the fagade, 
however, notable features were introduced. In the middle of each 
side may be seen a lofty arched bay projecting slightly from the 
body of the building, with a doorway, sometimes of the lintel and 
bracket order, surmounted by an arched window opening accom¬ 
modated within the huge arched recess. The remaining parts of 
each fagade are disposed in the exterior into a number of horizontal 
zones by cornice mouldings, and further variegated by arched re¬ 
cesses and window openings in each zone. The treatment of the 
upper part of the structure resembles, in a way, that of the octa¬ 
gonal tombs. The walls terminate in battlemented parapets with 
pinnacles ( gul-dastas ) at the corners of the square as well as at the 
angles formed by the projecting bays. The dome, which usually 
shows a band of lotus petal ornament at the base, is raised on an 
octagonal drum and is flanked at each corner of the roof by a 
pillared kiosk. The most eminent productions of this class of 
tombs are Bara Khan ka Gumbad, 53 Chhote Khan ka Gumbad, 54 
Bara Gumbad 55 (Fig. 16), Shis Gumbad, 56 tomb of Shihab-ud-dln 
Taj Khan, 57 Dad! ka Gumbad, 58 and Poll ka Gumbad. 59 The 
majority belong to the fifteenth century A.D. Tombs of this class 
are usually higher than those of the octagonal kind, though hori¬ 
zontally their dimensions are lesser. Yet, in spite of their added 
elevation and diversified treatment of the fagade, they lack the 
solemn dignity of the octagonal tombs. 

Though no large mosques of the public or congregational kind 
are known to have been erected during this phase, a few mosque 
buildings of the private kind, belonging to the period, are notable 
as anticipating a new trend that was to reach its fulfilment in the 
period immediately following that covered by the present volume.

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Among the monuments of this series the earliest is a small mosque 60 
attached to the Bara Gumbad, built towards the close of the fifteenth 
century A.D. Of its notable features mention should be made of 
the tah-khana basement and tapering turrets at the rear corners, 
features that are clearly derived from the FIruzian buildings. 
Striking innovations are, however, introduced in the composition of 
the facade which consists of five open arches of a peculiar shape, 
being inordinately wide and flattened at the top. Though practi¬ 
cally of the same height, the outlines of the arches are diversified 
by a variable number of receding planes, and elegant ornament in 
plaster covers the entire exterior. Similar ornament is also used 
in the interior of the prayer chamber. The domes are increased in 
size as well as elevation. All these indicate a fresh inspiration 
striving for a new and effective form in mosque design. But the 
different elements being, to a certain extent, loosely knit, the pro¬ 
duction, as a whole, lacks organic unity and fails to be pleasing. 
There is no doubt that the builders felt the urge for a new direction, 
but they seem to have had only a vague and faltering idea of it. 

The next mosque of the series, Moth ki Masjid 61 (Fig. 17), was 
built by the Prime Minister of Sikandar Lodi in the early years of 
the sixteenth century A.D. It is a fairly large building, being 124 
feet 6 inches from end to end, and follows fundamentally the design 
of the Bara Gumbad mosque with some notable improvements indi¬ 
cating that the builders had a clear idea of what was expected of 
them and had the necessary experience to achieve the desired re¬ 
sult. Particularly noteworthy is its fagade with its five arched 
openings, all much better spaced and proportioned, of which the 
central one is emphasized by having it boldly projected forward. 
The interior also is, to a great extent, spacious and dignified, and 
the domes above more pleasingly disposed. The tapering turrets on 
the back wall have each a refined contour. Added to these, the 
two-storeyed towers at the rear corners, each flanked by a pro¬ 
jecting balcony, lend a rare charm to the design of the building as a 
whole. Further, by a free intermixture of white marble, red sand¬ 
stone and enamelled tiles, a colourful effect is imparted to the exte¬ 
rior. According to Marshall, the mosque “epitomises in itself all that 
is best in the architecture of the Lodls,” and displays a “freedom of 
imagination, a bold diversity of design, an appreciation of contrast¬ 
ing light and shade and a sense of harmony in line and colour, which 
combine to make it one of the most spirited and picturesque build¬ 
ings of its kind in the whole range of Islamic art.” 62 

The remaining two buildings of the series, the Jamal! Mosque 
(A.D. 1536) 63 and the QiPa-i-Kuhna mosque 64 of Sher Shah in the 


686 


ART 


Puranja Qika, fall outside the scope of the present volume. It has 
to be noted here that the latter represents the new mosque design 
in its most elegant and mature form, and anticipates, in a way, the 
Mughul buildings of this order. 

III. PROVINCIAL STYLES 
A, Bengal 

Architectural activities of the Islamic rulers of Bengal seem to 
have begun with the establishment of the Islamic rule in the pro¬ 
vince by Ikhtyar-ud-din Muhammad Bakhtyar Khalji about the 
close of the twelfth century A.D. Minhaj-ud-dln, the author of the 
Tabaqat-i-Ndsiri / 5 mentions that Ikhtyar-ud-din himself establish¬ 
ed at Lakhnawati mosques, colleges, rest-houses and other buildings. 
The same authority 66 further speaks of Hisam-ud-din Twaz ? one of 
the successors of Ikhtyar-ud-din, who assumed the title of Sultan 
under the name of Ghiyas-ud-din, that he built mosques, madrassahs, 
rest-houses, etc., in his capital and constructed roads across the low 
and marshy country. Epigraphic records testify to the erection of 
mosques in Bengal during the thirteenth century and the first quar¬ 
ter of the fourteenth; one at Pinchhli, 67 eight miles to the north¬ 
west of Malda, by Sultan Iltutmish ( 1211 - 1236 ); another (with a 
mausoleum—Fig. 23) at Tribeni (Hooghly District) by Zafar Khan 
GhazI (c. A.D. 1298); and a third at Gaumalti, near Gaur (Malda 
District) in A.D. 1311. 68 But none of these or other early Muslim 
monuments in Bengal have survived. 

No existing Muslim monument in Bengal can be dated earlier 
than the middle of the fourteenth century A.D. and the extant re¬ 
mains all belong to the period of a little over two centuries (A.D. 
1338-1576). Mosques and tombs, representing the religious side of 
architecture, naturally followed the characteristic forms of Muslim 
architecture in India and elsewhere. But in details of construction 
and design there was evolved a local individuality, due to contact 
with, and assimilation of ; the earlier practices in this region. 

These religious buildings may be divided stylistically into the 
following groups: 1. Oblong type with a vaulted central nave and 
multi-domed side-wings; 2. Single-domed square type; 3. Multi- 
domed oblong type; and 4. Single-domed type with corridors run¬ 
ning on three sides. This stylistic grouping may also be found to 
have an approximate chronological bearing. The third type appears 
to have been adapted from the first by omitting the central nave, and 
the fourth from the second by the addition of corridors on three sides. 


687 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


The earliest of the extant types of Muslim buildings in Bengal 
is characterized by an oblong structure, divided into a central nave 
and two side-wings. The central nave is covered by an elongated 
vault, which is a continuation of the main front arch that spans the 
entire width and height of the nave. The wings which are several 
aisles deep, are roofed by low hemispherical domes, their number 
depending on the number of interspaces formed by the division of 
the wings into bays and aisles. The oblong shape with the central 
nave higher than the two side-wings, as we see in the present type, 
are met with elsewhere in India, especially in the region of Gujarat; 
but the tall and elongated barrel-shaped vault covering the nave 
and the other details and particulars of the type are, on the whole, 
peculiar to Bengal and seldom found outside its limits. Of this type 
we have only a few extant examples, namely the Adlna mosque at 
Hazarat Pandua (Malda District), and the Gunamant mosque and 
the Darasbari mosque, both at Gaur. 

The famous Jami‘ mosque, known as the Adlna, 69 was built by 
Sultan Sikandar Shah in 770 or 776 A.H. (A.D. 1369 or 1374), and, as 
Marshall says, by a strange coincidence, the first monument extant 
in Bengal “was also the most ambitious structure of its kind ever 
essayed in Eastern India.” 70 Almost as big as the great mosque at 
Damascus, it covers an area of 507 feet 6 inches by 285 feet 6 inches 
externally, and consists, on the inside, of four great cloisters sur¬ 
rounding a central courtyard, 397 feet by 159 feet. 71 The western 
range of cloister, (Fig. 18), forming the prayer chamber, is five aisles 
deep, while the remaining ones have only three. The former is 
divided into a central nave (Fig. 19), 64 feet 4 inches by 33 feet 8 in¬ 
ches, and two side-wings (cf. Fig. 20), five archways on either side of 
the nave opening into the five aisles of the side-wings. The nave 
was covered by an elongated vault spanning the whole width, and 
though fallen down, the vaulted roof may be found marked in out-line 
against the top of the back wall which also shows a window-opening 
almost at the apex. The back wall shows the prayer niche (mihrdb) 
flanked on the south by a similar niche and on the north by the pul¬ 
pit ( mimbar), the latter consisting of a canopied platform approach¬ 
ed by a flight of steps. Each of the two side-wings has eighteen 
bays corresponding to eighteen niches in the back wall and as many 
arched openings in front. Five bays in the three rear aisles of the 
northern wing are occupied by an upper gallery, known as Badshah 
ka takht, 12 supported on short but ponderous pillars about 8 feet in 
height. The cloisters on the north, south and east are continuous 
and are each three aisles in depth. On account of the division of 
the design into so many bays and aisles, the total space occupied by 


688 


ART 


the four lines of cloisters is subdivided into 378 small squares, each 
of which was once covered by a small dome. 73 The regular 
sequence of bays and aisles, of arched screens, of numerous domes 
and pillars, each a replica of the other, is, to a certain extent, tire¬ 
some; yet a view of the western cloister with the gigantic central 
archway, 33 feet in width and more than 60 feet in height, 74 flanked 
on either side, by a screen of smaller arches, each of 8 feet span, has 
certainly an imposing effect. The mihrdb niches in the back wall of 
the western cloister are formed by exquisitely carved pillars sup¬ 
porting usually trefoil arches, apparently collected from older Hindu 
buildings, while the wall space above exhibits minute carved brick 
decorations, so shallow in relief as to appear encrusted on the surface. 

This great composition, it is curious to note, had not been pro¬ 
vided with any imposing entrance gateway. An arched opening in 
the middle of the east side and three archways at the eastern end of 
the southern cloister were probably meant for public use, while 
two small doorways in the rear wall of the western cloister were 
probably intended for the Mullets and other dignitaries. Attached 
to the northern half of the back wall of the prayer chamber is a 
square chamber, in which Sikandar Shah, the builder of the mosque, 
is said to have been buried. There are three entrances from this 
chamber to the Bddshdli ha takht in the north-western wing of the 
western cloister, possibly for the use of the royal family. 

The Gunamant 75 (Fig. 21) and the Darasbari 76 mosques at Gaur, 
each in an extremely fragmentary state, also belong to a conception 
identical to that of the Adlna mosque, though their dimensions are 
much smaller. The vaulted roof of the central nave in the Guna¬ 
mant still exists and shows the use of vertical ribs in association 
with a row of arched recesses at the bottom running along the entire 
length on either side. It is not known wdiether this feature was 
also present in the Adina and the Darasbari, as vaulted roofs of both 
have collapsed. The Gunamant and the Darasbari mosques have 
been dated respectively in A.D. 1484 and 1479 on the strength of 
two inscriptions found near them. There is, however, no certainty 
that the two inscriptions belonged originally to these two mosques. 
An earlier date seems more reasonable as both these mosques agree 
in all essential respects with the great Adina mosque, more than a 
century earlier than the dates proposed. 

The second type is characterized by a single-domed square 
building and absence of pillars inside the hall, which are common in 
the first and third types. Externally there are four corner turrets, 
usually octagonal in shape, rising just above the cornices which, 

689 


D.S.—44 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


again, are slightly curved, a peculiarity that has been rightly 
traced to imitation of bamboo constructions popular in Bengal. 
The tombs usually have four doors in the four walls; the mosques 
have one or three in front with corresponding number of mihrab 
niches in the back wall. Entrances through the side walls 
may occasionally be found also in case of mosques. Sometimes the 
single-domed square mosque exhibits a corridor running along the 
whole front, both the corridor and the hall having as many entran¬ 
ces as there are mihrab niches in the back wall of the sanctuary. 
Apart from the massive dome spanning the hall proper there are 
three more small domes roofing the corridor. 

The earliest example of the single-domed square type is the 
Eklakhi mausoleum 77 at Hazarat Pandua, traditionally reputed to 
be the tomb of Jalal-ud-dln Muhammad Shah (A.D. 1415-31). The 
fabric is of brick, occasionally interspersed with horn-blende slabs 
collected from older Hindu buildings. Externally the dimensions 
are nearly square, being 78 feet 6 inches by 74 feet 6 inches. The 
interior, however, is an octagon of 48 feet 6 inches diameter. There 
are four arched doorways (fitted with door-frames from Hindu 
monuments), one on each face, and four cells in the thickness 
of the walls inside, each one at each of the four corners. The semi¬ 
circular dome rises directly from the octagon of the interior. 
There is no cylindrical or octagonal drum as support for the dome 
which, on this account, looks low and stunted. This loss of height 
on account of the absence of any seat for the dome is a common 
weakness of Muslim buildings in Bengal, and no monument, whether 
single-domed or multi-domed, attains that grandeur which is 
characteristic of Islamic buildings elsewhere. The dome of the 
Lotan Masjid at Gaur (to be described later), however, has a flat 
vault as its support and thereby gains considerably in height. The 
ceiling of the Eklakhi tomb is neatly plastered ? while there appear 
to have been painted decorations on the inside. The exterior, 
again, is diversified by vertical offsets and recesses, fine horizontal 
bands, and mouldings and decorations in carved brick, in an infinite 
variety of floral designs. The curved cornices project considerably 
from the walls, and together with the octagonal corner turrets with 
their horizontal bands are bold and rich in effect. But in spite of its 
pleasing lineaments and the beauty and variety of terracotta orna¬ 
mentations, the Eklakhi suffers in comparison with tomb construc¬ 
tions in the west, as lacking in height and dignity, and the semi¬ 
circular dome, however massive, over a square structure, leaves the 
corners bare,—a void that emphasizes the loss of balance and organic 
unity in the whole structure. 


690 


ART 


What is known as the Chika Masjid 78 or the ‘Bats mosque’ at 
Gaur is an exact copy of the Eklakhi, except for its dimensions 
which are slightly smaller. Though described as a masjid locally, 
there is no prayer niche in the western hall. Creighton described 
it as a gate on the basis of an inscription, discovered by Francklin, 
recording the erection of a gateway in 909 A.H. (A.D. 1504) by 
‘Ala-ud-dln Husain Shah. But the building, so closely following the 
Eklakhi in plan, form and dimensions, appears to be much earlier, 
and Cunningham is inclined to regard it as a tomb, perhaps of 
Mahmud I (A.D. 1437-59). But no trace of any grave has been 
found inside the building, and local tradition, it may be pointed out, 
connects the building with the state prison where Husain Shah 
confined his minister Sanatan. 

To the same type belong the smaller mosque at Chhota 
Pandua 75 (Hooghly district) (A.D. 1577), the old mosque at 
Goaldihi, 80 Sonargaon (A.D. 1519), and the old mosque at Molla 
Simla 81 (Hooghly district). There is, however, a necessary modi¬ 
fication of the design in the provision of mihmb niches in the 
western wall. In a few mosques of this order the design is found 
slightly elaborated by the provision of a corridor in front of the 
prayer hall. The prayer hall is covered by a single dome, and the 
corridor, by three smaller domes, in conformity with the three bays 
formed by three entrance archways in front. Among the monu¬ 
ments of this order mention should be made of the mosque at 
Gopalganj 82 (Dinajpur district), erected in A.D. 1460, the Cham- 
katti 83 and the Lotan 84 mosque at Gaur, both assigned to the reign 
of Yusuf Shah, the mosque at Kheraul 85 (Murshidabad district), and 
the Rukn Khan mosque at Debikot 86 (Dinajpur district), erected 
respectively in A.D. 1494 and A.D. 1512. Among these, the Lotan 
mosque (Fig. 22), traditionally connected with a beautiful dancer of 
the royal court, is of more than ordinary interest. A pleasing variety 
has been obtained in this mosque by grading the dimensions of the 
different archways. Another variation may be noticed in the pro¬ 
vision of six corner turrets, instead of the usual four at the four 
corners of the hall, there being an additional one at either end of 
the corridor. Still more commendable is the construction of the 
massive dome which is supported on a drum, cylindrical outside and 
of the shape of a flattened vault inside. This support adds to the 
height and dignity of the building, and also to the organic beauty 
which is unfortunately lacking in the majority of the buildings of 
this kind in Bengal. Glazed bricks of various colours and patterns 
faced the building both inside and out. This inordinate desire for 
surface ornamentation has lent the building a rather gaudy appear- 


691 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


ance which has, to a certain extent, marred the structural beauty to 
which it aspired. 

The third type is characterized by an oblong structure, divided 
into several aisles by rows of pillars, supporting the arches of the 
domes, and cut into a number of bays, corresponding to the number 
of prayer niches in the back wall and arched openings in front. The 
roof consists of successive rows of low and small domes, their num¬ 
ber depending on the number of interspaces formed by the division 
of the interior into bays and aisles. As usual in Bengal, curved 
cornices and polygonal corner turrets are also characteristic ele¬ 
ments of such a structure. Manmohan Chakravarti 87 describes the 
type as “many-domed parallelepiped. ” The oldest extant building 
of this group cannot be dated earlier than the latter half of the 
fifteenth century A.D. As has been already mentioned, the type 
appears to be a simplified adaptation of the type of oblong structure 
with a central nave and two side-wings (Adina, Gunamant) that had 
been typical of the fourteenth century A.D. In the fifteenth cen¬ 
tury the central nave was eliminated and the type of multi-domed 
oblong structure was evolved. The type was in vogue in the latter 
part of the fifteenth and the earlier part of the sixteenth century 
A.D., and quite a good number of examples have been found in 
different parts of Bengal. 

This group has several sub-varieties, distinguished by the 
number of bays in the interior, such as (a) three-bayed, (b) five- 
bayed, (c) eleven-bayed, and (d) twenty-one-bayed. The three-bayed 
buildings are nearly square, the proportion between length and 
breadth being approximately 3:2. The bays correspond to the 
three mihmb niches in the back wall and the three archways in 
front. Usually they are divided into two or three aisles by one or 
two rows of pillars. The domes are either six or nine, correspond¬ 
ing to the number of smaller squares formed by the arrangement 
of bays and aisles. Buildings of this order are usually small and 
unpretentious, and among the examples may be mentioned the Salik 
mosque at Basirhat 88 (Twenty-four Parganas), Baba Adam’s mosque 
at Vikrampur, 89 Jalal-ud-din’s mosque at Satgaon, 90 the mosque at 
Kusumba 91 (Rajshahi district), the Kasba mosque at Bakarganj and 
the Jahaniyan mosque at Gaur. 92 All these seem to have been 
erected between the latter half of the fifteenth and the first half of 
the sixteenth century A.D. 

The five-bayed buildings are long and rectangular structures 
with five mihrdbs in the back wall and five frontal archways. They 
are divided into two or three aisles, and the number of domes is 
either ten or fifteen accordingly. Among the extant monuments of 


692 


ART 


this group should be mentioned the Majlis Sahib’s mosque at Kalna 93 
(Burdwan district), the Tantlpara 94 and the Chhoti Sona masjid 95 
at Gaur, the old mosque at Hemtabad 96 (Dinajpur district), the Zafar 
Khan mosque (Fig. 24) at Tribeni 97 (Hooghly district), and the 
mosque at Bagha 98 (Rajshahi district). The group includes a few of 
the finest Muslim buildings in Bengal, and of these, the Tantlpara and 
the Chhoti Sona masjid at Gaur merit special attention. The former 
(Figs. 25, 27), probably erected about A.D. 1480, has been described 
by Cunningham as “the finest of all the buildings now remaining at 
Gaur.” 99 The long rectangular hall, 78 feet by 31 feet on the inside 
is divided into two aisles. Besides the five front arched openings, 
corresponding to the number of milirabs in the back wall, there are 
four more, two each in the two side walls. There was also probably 
an upper platform at the northern end. The ten domes in two rows 
of five each, which spanned the building, have all fallen down, as 
also a part of the arched fagade. Yet, even in its ruined state it is one 
of the finest of all the Muslim buildings in Bengal on account of its 
rich and effective ornamentation in terracotta and the large deco¬ 
rated panels that stands out in relief against the plain walls. The 
rich colour of red bricks also adds to the beauty of the building in 
contrast to the gaudy glazed bricks facing the Lotan masjid . The 
Chhoti Sona masjid (Figs. 26, 29) was built by Wali Muhammad in 
the reign of ‘Ala-ud-dm Husain Shah (A.D. 1493-1519). It is a rectan¬ 
gular building, 70 feet 4 inches by 40 feet 9 inches on the inside, and 
the comparative increase in the width leads to the division of the inte¬ 
rior into three aisles by two rows of four pillars each. The north¬ 
western corner of the hall is occupied by an upper platform. Besides 
the five front archways there are six more, three each in the side 
walls opening into the three aisles of the building. The central bay is 
spanned by three superstructures, each consisting of four flat seg¬ 
ments meeting at the top in the shape of a curved thatched roof of 
Bengali huts. The four other bays are spanned by twelve hemi¬ 
spherical domes, slightly diminishing in size towards the outer ends 
and thus furnishing a slightly curved ensemble in conformity with 
the curved cornices of the building. The building is faced with 
stone, entirely on the outside and partially on the inside. There 
are carved decorations on the outer facade in very low relief, but 
they are more or less mechanical, and lack the spontaneity of the 
exquisite ornamentations in the Tantlpara mosque. Traces of gild¬ 
ing are to be found on the inside of some of the domes of the Chhoti 
Sona masjid, and this may probably account for the name by which 
it is known now. 

The eleven-bayed mosques are rather rare, only two being 
known so far. They are the Bari Sona masjid at Gaur 100 and the 


693 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


Sath Gumbad mosque at Bagerhat 101 (Khulna district). The in¬ 
crease in the number of bays leads to an inordinate length of the 
composition, which is sometimes sought to be compensated by 
increasing the width by adding to the number of aisles. The 
number of domes spanning the building corresponds to the number 
of subdivisions of the interior space by the arrangement of bays, 
aisles and corridors. The Bari Sona masjid at Gaur (Fig. 28), erected 
by Sultan Nasrat Shah in A.D. 1526, is a massive rectangular building, 
168 feet by 76 feet, with six corner turrets, four at the four corners 
of the hall and one at either end of the corridor in front. The hall 
is divided into three aisles by two rows of ten pillars each, and is 
preceded by a corridor running along the whole front and separated 
from the hall by another row of ten ponderous pillars. There are 
eleven arched entrances to the hall as well as to the corridor, corres¬ 
ponding to the eleven mihrabs in the back wall. Three side-open¬ 
ings at either end lead to the three aisles of the hall and one each to 
the corridor. Three bays in the north-west corner of the hall were 
occupied by an upper platform. Forty-four domes, in four rows 
of eleven each (three over the aisles of the hall and one over the 
corridor), originally roofed the building; but of these only the 
eleven over the corridor now remain. The mosque was built of 
bricks, entirely faced with stone on the outside and up to the arch¬ 
springs on the inside. Like the Chhoti Sona masjid } it also appears 
to have been originally gilded, but being sparingly adorned it 
attains a greater simplicity and impressive dignity, and Fergusson 
was inclined to regard it as “perhaps the finest memorial now left 
at Gaur.” 102 The arcaded corridor offers, no doubt, an impressive 
view, as also the massive stolidity of the buiding. In front of the 
building is an immense quadrangle, about 200 feet square, with 
three arched gateways on the east, north and south. The Sath 
Gumbad at Bagerhat is another example of the eleven-bayed mosque 
in Bengal. It is associated with the name of Khan-i-Jahan ‘All, and 
consists of a long rectangular building, internally 134 feet by 96 feet, 
divided into seven aisles by means of slender pillars, each aisle 
communicating with an arched opening in each of the two side 
walls. In front there are eleven archways corresponding to the 
eleven mihrabs in the back wall, the central one being larger than 
the side-ones flanking it. The immense building is spanned by 
seventy domes in seven rows of ten each, separated by seven hut¬ 
shaped vaults covering the central bay. The fagade introduces 
some unusual features. The cornice, instead of being curved in the 
usual Bengali fashion, exhibits a straight edged slope from a 
triangular pediment over the central bay. The corner turrets are 


694 


ART 


round, instead of being polygonal, and each of them has an upper 
story pierced by two arched openings and covered by a dome. 

The mosque with twenty-one bays may be said to represent an 
extreme exaggeration of the tendency of imparting grandeur and 
effect to a building by multiplying its parts and thereby increasing 
its size. It is this tendency which, stage by stage, led to the multi¬ 
plication of bays and aisles. But this multiplication should apply 
to both the bays and aisles, as such a procedure in one direction only 
is likely to lead to a loss of proportions and to an inordinate in¬ 
crease of size in one direction only. This is exactly what happened 
in case of the single example of the twenty-one-bayed building, ex¬ 
tant now, namely the Baradwari mosque at Chhota Pandua 103 
(Hoogly district) ; now in a ruined condition. This mosque, along 
with the minar adjacent to it, is supposed to have been erected 
by Shah Saif-ud-dm, a nephew of Firuz Shah Tughluq, in the four¬ 
teenth century A.D. But such a date appears to be rather too 
early for the mosque, as the style evidently indicates a much later 
age, and it is not unreasonable to infer that it belonged to the period 
of the multi-domed type of mosques under discussion. Its plan and 
arrangement, too, place it as one of the late manifestations of the 
type. It is a long rectangular block, externally 231 feet by 42 feet, 
and was divided on the inside into three long aisles by two rows of 
twenty pillars each. The pillars are of varying shapes and designs, 
and were apparently collected from a number of older edifices. 
Corresponding to the twenty-one mihrabs in the back wall there 
were as many frontal archways, and three more in each of the two 
side walls opening into the long aisles. The mihrab niches were 
well carved, and the pulpit, a miniature stone platform with a 
dome-shaped canopy carved out of a single block, is graceful and 
well designed. The entire building was spanned by sixty-three 
low domes (many of which have fallen down) in three long rows of 
twenty-one each. It is unfortunate that the inordinate length of 
the building has not been compensated by a corresponding increase 
of its width. The elevation, again, falls far too short to compare 
favourably with the horizontal dimensions. With its low elevation 
and a length nearly six times its breadth, and with its regular and 
monotonous features, the building looks more like a military barack 
than a place of worship. 

The fourth, the single-doomed type with corridors running along 
the three sides, is represented by a single specimen, the Qadam 
Rasul at Gaur 104 built by Nusrat Shah in A.D. 1531. It consists of 
a rectangular hall, 19 feet square, with corridors running along 
the front and two sides. The hall itself has three doors, one in 


695 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


front and one each on either side. The corridor has three frontal 
archways, supported on short and ponderous stone pillars, and two 
more on the two sides. The hall itself is covered by a single dome 
with a lotus-like pinnacle at the top, and the corridors by flat vault¬ 
ed roofs. At each corner there is an octagonal turret surmounted 
by a stone pillar. Except for the stone pillars supporting the arch¬ 
ways in front, it is built of bricks and the fagade is highly ornament¬ 
ed by horizontal bands and panels of carved brick. 

The first type represented by the great Adlna mosque at Hazarat 
Pandua, may be said to be characteristic of the fourteenth century 
A.D., and the second seems to have been in vogue till approximately 
the third quarter of the fifteenth century, though in the outlying 
districts stray examples of the type may be found still later. The 
third type was common since the last quarter of the fifteenth cen¬ 
tury. Sultans Husain Shah and Nusrat Shah being two of its eminent 
patrons. The fourth cannot be dated earlier than the second quarter 
of the sixteenth century. 

Only a few buildings of the secular order have survived in 
Bengal. The massive Baisgazi wall at Gaur 105 is supposed to have 
been a part of the palace precincts, but nothing now remains of the 
royal palace itself. In the capital city of Gaur several gateway 
buildings are still extant, and of these the one, known as the Dakhil 
Barwaza, 106 represents a conception of more than ordinary interest. 
According to an inscription, it was built during the reign of Barbak 
Shah (A.D. 1459-1474), very possibly as the principal gateway to the 
citadel of Gaur (Fig. 30). It is 75 feet in length across the front, 
60 feet in height, and nearly 113 feet in depth from front to back with 
a long arched passage, 24 feet high and with guard-rooms on either 
side, carried through its centre. Immense though its dimensions, the 
huge bulk has been broken up and diversified by alternating effects 
of light and shade imparted through projections and recesses. At 
each corner stands a tall and substantial circular bastion, tapering 
as it goes up and surmounted by a cupola at the top. The arched 
passage is set within a prominent arched bay that boldly projects 
forward. The surfaces, so diversified, are further enriched by a 
judicious distribution of ornamental work in terracotta. Entirely 
built of bricks, the Dakhil Darwaza at Gaur may rank as one of the 
most remarkable monuments of Muslim architecture in Bengal. 

Another notable conception may be found in the Firuz Minar 
(Fig. 31) at Gaur 107 which towers high above the crumbling ruins of 
the ancient city. It rises to a height of about 84 feet in five storeys, 
the three lowest being do-decagonal, and the upper two circular. The 
top of the tower has collapsed; It is possible that it was terminated 


696 


ART 


by a dome. Being of brick fabric, the decorative work has been 
carried out in terracotta in minute and intricate patterns. Colour 
is also applied to the surface by the use of glazed tiles in blue and 
white. In Bengal glazed tile ornamentation had been the charac¬ 
teristic mode of lending colour to the brick surface as well as relief 
to the terracotta ornamental work. It adds, no doubt, a contrast to 
the rich red texture of brick, but the combination of the two cannot 
be said to have been always happy. Another minar, named also 
after FIruz, may be seen at Chhota P-andua. 108 It is about 120 feet 
high and also divided into a number of storeys. It is a much 
simpler structure and lacks the elegant appearance of its counter¬ 
part at Gaur. The girth at the bottom is much too large in relation 
to the height of the structure. 

“Islamic architecture of Bengal is not a style of building of a 
very impressive kind.” 109 The difficulty of obtaining stone in the 
flat plain of Bengal, and the consequent wholesale dependence on 
brick for constructions of a more permanent kind, resulted in the 
evolution of distinct forms and idioms, some of which might have 
existed in the earlier period. The style that was developed as a 
consequence may be designated as the ‘brick style’ of Bengal. It 
was the weak and fragile nature of the material that was responsi¬ 
ble for the low elevation of the buildings, the comparative insigni¬ 
ficance of the arches, and the smallness of the domes. The narrow 
pointed arches were, no doubt, resorted to avoid wide open spaces 
and thus to ensure greater stability to brick constructions. The 
dome was assembled in concentric courses of flat bricks, gradually 
diminishing in circumference, one above the other, until at the top 
it was spanned by a single brick or stone slab. This primitive method, 
followed probably in imitation of the earlier practice of the trabeated 
dome, limited the size and height of the domes. Brick was also res¬ 
ponsible perhaps for the projected pendentives at the corners used 
for the support of the circular dome over a quadrangular space. 
The heaviness of the building has also been due to a desire for ensur¬ 
ing permanence to the brick structure, and this, together with its 
low elevation, lends an effect of squatness to the structure as a 
whole. The brick construction was also responsible for the heavy 
and short pillars that support the arches and vaults, the solidity of 
these supports being necessary for redeeming the inherent weakness 
of brick as a building material. Their design and division into the 
characteristic sections recall those of the tall stone pillars with 
which we are familiar in the pre-Muslim days. The .short and 
stunted pillar is one of the chief features of Muslim architecture in 
Bengal, and provides a striking contrast to slender arcades of Mus¬ 
lim monuments elsewhere. 


697 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


On account of the above limitations of the building material the 
architects in Bengal tried to create effect by reiterating the parts 
and thereby enlarging the dimensions of the building. But mere 
dimension without any corresponding increase of height fails to 
achieve the desired end and, not infrequently, leads to a loss of 
balance and organic unity. Again, the reiteration of the same ele¬ 
ments,—bays, aisles and domes,—leads to an effect of monotony, 
and there is no other relieving feature to redeem it. It is reasonable 
to infer also that the relative meagreness of bricks stimulated the 
artists to devise, as compensation, the rich ornament in terracotta 
that seems to be the glory of Muslim architecture of Bengal. The 
designs were pleasing so long as there were variety and boldness of 
conception in them; but later they merged into mere mechanical 
patterns endlessly repeated. Abstractly conceived, the earlier 
antecedents of many of these designs were inspired by a desire for 
giving decorative effect to constructions in brick, which by its flat¬ 
ness has very little scope for variegation of light and shade. Curved 
cornice is one of the distinctive characteristics of the Muslim build¬ 
ings in Bengal, and this form may originally be traced to construc¬ 
tions in bamboo or timber, a popular building medium in Bengal 
from the earliest days. The hut-shaped superstructure, over the roof 
and in juxtaposition with the semi-circular dome, is also charac¬ 
teristically Bengali. Percy Brown thus sums up the achievements 
of the architects of Muslim Bengal: “What they achieved may not 
have been a great art, but its constructive principles were sound, 
its appearances were inventive and original, and it was peculiarly 
suitable to the climate and to the purpose for which it was 
intended.” 110 

B. Jaunpur 

The city of Jaunpur was founded in A.D. 1359-60 by Firuz Shah 
Tughluq as a strategic military outpost and remained for a time the 
chief city of an important dependency of the Delhi empire. In 
A.D. 1394 the governor of the province shook off the allegiance to 
Delhi and established an independent kingdom with Jaunpur as 
its capital. This independent kingdom lasted for nearly a century 
till it was re-absorbed into the Delhi empire by Sultan Sikandar Lodi. 
During this period, under the able and intelligent patronage of the 
Sharqi kings, Jaunpur became a leading centre of artistic and cul¬ 
tural activities, and saw the erection of many imposing monuments 
including palaces, mosques, tombs, etc. Unfortunately, very few 
vestiges of this architectural splendour can now be seen. Of the 
few surviving remains of the fourteenth century, when Jaunpur 
was a province of the Delhi Sultanate, mention may be made of the 


698 


ART 


mosque and fort of Ibrahim Naib Barbak, 111 built respectively in 
A.D. 1376 and 1377. Of the fort, only the eastern gate can be seen 
now, and this, as well as the mosque, were, more or less, simple and 
ordinary productions. Neither of the two can be said to have a dis¬ 
tinctive feature worthy of note. The foundation of one of the earliest 
mosques at Jaunpur, afterwards called the Atala Masjid , 112 was 
laid in A.D. 1377, but it was not till A.D. 1408 that Ibrahim Shah 
Sharql erected the mosque on this foundation. As its name indi¬ 
cates, the mosque occupies the site of an earlier temple dedicated 
to the worship of Atala Devi, and it is largely the materials of the 
earlier temple that were utilized in its construction. Built on the 
orthodox plan, it consists of an open square court, measuring 177 
feet each side, with colonnaded cloisters on the north, south and 
east and the sanctuary or prayer chamber on the west. The cloisters 
are pierced in the middle of each side by a handsome gateway build¬ 
ing, the northern and the southern ones being each covered by a 
dome. The spacious cloisters are each five aisles in depth and rise 
up in two storeys, the upper covered by a flat roof. Of the lower 
storey two aisles, forming a range of cells with a pillared verandah, 
open on the outside. This outer arrangement of a part of each 
cloister is, no doubt, a novel feature in the mosque design. But the 
most arresting feature in the entire composition is the facade of the 
sanctuary where three huge propylon screens confront the spectator 
with their massive and overpowering dimensions. Each of these 
has battering sides, not unlike the pylons of the Egyptian temples, 
and the huge bulk is relieved by tier upon tier of arched niches 
within rectangular frames. Each pylon, again, contains a large • 
arched recess leading to the entrances of the nave and of the tran¬ 
septs at the sides, the screen in the inner end in each case having 
in the upper section trellised windows in a number of rows for admis¬ 
sion of light into the interior. The central pylon with the entrance 
to the nave is the largest and is flanked by two smaller ones 
accommodating entrances to the two transepts. It is the arrange¬ 
ment of these massive propylons which gives the facade a bold and 
individual appearance and constitutes the most distinctive element 
of the style. 

The interior of the prayer chamber (Fig. 32) is divided into a cen¬ 
tral nave and two transepts ? one on either side. The rectangular hall 
of the nave shows an arrangement of arches and arcades in three 
vertical stages, square in the lowest, octagonal in the second, and 
sixteen-sided in the third, the last in the shape of an arcaded tri- 
forium supporting the great ribbed dome spanning the hall. The 
side arches in the lowest stage open into the transepts, while in the 
upper stages the screened arches provide for the admission of light 


699 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


into the nave. The transept on either side of the nave is a long 
lateral hall which, by an arrangement of pillars, resolves into an 
octagonal bay in the centre covered by a smaller dome. At the 
extreme end this hall is disposed in two storeys, the upper, with 
stone grilles around, constituting the ladies’ gallery. 

In spite of its original character, many of the features of the 
Atala mosque seem to have been borrowed from the Tughluq archi¬ 
tectural tradition. The shape of the recessed arch, its fringes of 
spear-heads, now almost an ornamental motif, and the battering 
sides of the pylon enclosing the arch recall the typical characteristics 
of the Tughluq buildings at Delhi. The combination of the trabeate 
and arcuate systems of construction in this mosque is also evidently 
derived from the same source. The treatment of the rear wall of the 
sanctuary (Fig. 33) with its three boldly projecting surfaces, corres¬ 
ponding to the three compartments in the interior, each with its 
projecting bay in the propylon in front, and to the three domes of 
the roof, adds, no doubt, an individual note to the Atala mosque. 
The tapering turrets at the corners of the projections and at main 
angles of the building are, again, evidently imitated from similar 
elements of Flruzian architecture. 

In the composition of the Atala mosque we have a new and 
bold conception of mosque which became characteristic of the 
Jaunpur style of Indo-Muslim architecture. The few subsequent 
monuments that remain now were built essentially on the model of 
the Atala, which came to be regarded as the touchstone of the style. 
The substantial portals in the middle of the three cloisters are caught 
up by the vast and massive pylons in the facade of the sanctuary, 
and together they produce an effective ensemble. As a whole, how¬ 
ever, the mosque cannot be regarded architecturally as a success. 
The incongruity of the different elements of the composition and a 
lack of harmony in their inter-relation are too glaring, and the 
building fails to denote that structural propriety which is pre¬ 
requisite of all good architecture. 

Another mosque, the Jhanjhiri Masjid , 113 built also by Ibrahim 
Shah Sharqi about A.D. 1430, although now in a dilapidated condi¬ 
tion, deserves more than a passing notice. Only the massive pylon 
in the centre of sanctuary fagade now remains; but it seems to 
have been a copy, on a smaller scale, of the Atala Masjid. The 
entire surface, however, is covered by an exuberance of carvings, 
and the rich plastic effect, produced thereby, endows the monument 
with more than ordinary interest. The Khalis-Mukhlis Masjid , 114 
built also about the same period, is a rather plain and simple struc¬ 
ture of hardly any architectural interest. 


700 


ART 


About the middle of the fifteenth century was built the small 
mosque, known as the Lai Darwdza Masjid 115 (Fig. 34) on account of 
its vermilion-painted gate. Marshall 116 describes it as “a small but 
pale edition of the Atala” of which it is only two-thirds in size. 
There are, however, certain divergences, the most important being 
its single propylon, much lower in height in comparison to its width 
at the base. The ladies’ galleries in the Lai Darwdza are, again, 
situated in the parts of the transepts adjoining the nave, instead of 
at the far ends as in the Atala. The sanctuary, moreover, has a 
single dome over its nave ? the roofs of the transepts being differently 
disposed. Further, each of the cloisters is two aisles in depth and 
rises in only one storey. These are important differences, no doubt, 
but not sufficient enough to mark the Ldl Darwdza as an individual 
and original conception, apart from the Atala. 

The Jdmi c Masjid 117 (Fig. 35), built by Husain Shah Sharqi about 
A.D. 1470, is the largest and most ambitious of the Jaunpur mosques. 
It is essentially of the design of the Atala which it reproduces on 
a larger scale. There are differences, of course, between the two 
in matters of detail, and in certain aspects a few of these betoken 
a certain inventiveness and originality on the part of the builder 
of this grand mosque. The entire structure is raised over a lofty 
basement terrace, not unlike the tahkhdna basements of the Firuzian 
mosques at Delhi, and the lofty domed portals in the middle of the 
cloisters are approached by imposing flights of steps. The cloisters 
are tw'O-storeyed in elevation, like the Atala, but are only two aisles 
in depth. There is only one propylon (Fig. 36) in the middle of the 
sanctuary facade, but much more imposing in mansions than the 
central propylon of the Atala mosque. In the interior the prayer 
chamber has five compartments, the central nave being disposed in 
very much the same fashion as in the Atala. Adjoining it on either 
side there is a pillared transept in two storeys, the upper with screens 
around forming the ladies’ gallery. At the far end on each side is a 
vaulted wing, certainly a unique feature in compositions of this kind. 
Each wing measures 50 feet in length, 40 feet in width and 45 feet 
in height, and the spacious interior, unencumbered by supports of 
any kind, might, by itself, be regarded as an imposing conception. 
The construction of the wide pointed vault which spans the wing at 
each end is also ingenious and effective. 

The story of the Jaunpur architectural style closes with the 
Jdmi‘ Masjid which was the last to be erected in this doomed capital 
city. In spite of its apparent grandeur, the Jaunpur style has some 
inherent defects. The domes of the sanctuaries are invariably 
masked from view by the towering heights of the massive propylons. 


701 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


To a certain extent the execution, again, is coarse, and this feature 
adds to the rugged strength of the monuments. The style begins 
with a fresh spirit and high aspirations. But the builders themselves 
seem to have been incapable of achieving what they attempted to do. 
Their greatest drawback is a lack of sense of structural propriety, 
and this is clearly evident in every one of their buildings which, 
though to a certain extent beautiful and impressive so far as certain 
single parts are concerned, fails to reach the level of a balanced and 
integrated architectural composition. 

C. Malwa 

The existing Muslim monuments at Malwa bear evident traces 
of the impact of the Delhi Imperial style in many of their forms, 
decorative motifs, and structural practices, such as “the battering 
wails and pointed arch with spear-head ‘fringe’ of the early Tughluqs, 
the arch-lintel-bracket combination of Firuz, the ‘boat-keel’ dome 
and pyramidal roof of the Lodls,” 118 etc. 

It would be wrong, however, to describe the Muslim monuments 
of Malwa as slavish imitations of Delhi. The elements and features 
borrowed from the different phases of the Imperial style were skil¬ 
fully integrated into balanced and unified compositions, noble and 
distinctive in their appearance. Marshall 119 describes the build¬ 
ings of the Malwa Sultans, particularly those at Mandu, as “truly 
living and full of purpose, as instinct with creative genius as the 
models themselves from which they took their inspiration.” “Part 
of their distinctiveness”, he continues, “they owe no doubt to their 
impressive size and part to the remarkable beauty of their stone 
work which under the transforming effects of time and weather 
fakes on exquisitely beautiful tints of pink and orange and amethyst; 
but in a large measure their distinctive character is due to pecu¬ 
liarities of construction and ornament, to the happy proportions of 
their component parts or to other more subtle refinements that do 
not readily admit of analysis.” 

The monuments of Muslim architecture in Malwa are almost all 
concentrated in the city of Mandu. Although Dhar or Dhara was 
the ancient capital of the Par am ar as, where the Muslim Governors 
of Malwa established themselves in the fourteenth century A.D. 120 
Mandu became the capital of the independent State of Malwa, early 
in the fifteenth century. As elsewhere, the early buildings, specially 
the mosques, in Malwa were assembled out of the materials of dese¬ 
crated Hindu temples, according to the Islamic plan and convention; 
but nothing seems to have been done in the initial stage either to 
conceal or alter their essentially Hindu appearance. The extant re- 


702 


ART 


mains of this phase of improvised building activity belong to a period 
not earlier than the beginning of the fifteenth century A.D. They 
are the Kamal Maula Masjid 121 (c. 1400), the Lat Masjid (A.D. 
1405), J - 2 Dilwar Khan’s Masjid 123 (c. 1405), and the mosque of 
Malik Mughis 124 (A.D. 1452) at Mandu. In a few of these an at¬ 
tempt was made to hide the original appearance and improve the 
improvised design by re-dressing the earlier materials to suit the re¬ 
quirements of the new buildings, and introducing pointed arches in 
between the pillars. The effect is not altogether displeasing. Be¬ 
cause of their lightness these arch-shapes seem “to spring from pillar 
with an aerial grace” 125 and lend to the hall a subtle and refined 
appearance. 

Reference has been made above 126 to the fortress of Mandu, 
the most magnificent of all the fortress cities of India. It stands on 
an outlying spur of the Vindhyas, separated from the main plateau 
of Malwa by a deep ravine, and had been named as Shadiabad or 
‘the City of joy’. The original fortification goes back to the Hindu 
period, and Hushang Shah must have laid the foundation of his fort 
on the old ruins. With him began the second classical phase of 
Malwa Muslim architecture. He made Mandu not only one of the 
most impregnable fortresses in India, but also a city of splendid mag¬ 
nificence by erecting a large number of stately edifices which rank 
among the finest monuments of Muslim architecture in India on 
account of their boldness of design and graceful finish. 

Along the edges of the plateau on which the city stands run the 
battlemented walls of grey basalt extending over a length of more 
than 25 miles “and pierced at ten points by arched and vaulted gate¬ 
ways, or rather series of gateways, w 7 hich guard the steep 
approaches.” 127 All these gateways, however, do not seem to have 
been built in the same period. Those that were erected during the 
regime of the Malwa Sultans were, more or less, of uniform design. 
One of the earliest to be erected is the northern gateway, known as 
the Delhi Darwaza, 128 and this, though now in a mutilated state, 
enables one to have an idea of the general arrangement and forceful 
character of such buildings. This grand portal consists of a long 
and wide passage with massive archways at the front and back, and 
with guard rooms on either side. The passage was covered by an 
elongated vault supported on a series of smaller arches providing the 
interior with an appearance of no mean interest and effect. The 
main archways in their shapes and spear-head fringes recall those 
in the tomb of Ghiyas-ud-dln Tughluq at Tughluqabad (Delhi), but 
here they are more virile and massive in construction to suit the 
purpose of the building for which they were meant. The Tarapur 


703 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


gateway 129 on the south-western fringe of the city was also built 
at the same time, but later additions and renovations have almost 
obliterated its original appearance. 

Once the whole plateau within the walls was covered with 
splendid buildings, but only forty structures now survive in different 
stages of preservation. The largest and the most impressive of them 
is the great Jami c Masjid 130 which, according to an inscription, was 
begun by Hushang and completed by Sultan Mahmud Khalji in 
858 A.H. (A.D. 1454). A spacious example of its class, it occupies 
a quadrangle, 288 feet by 271 feet, and has an imposing domed en¬ 
trance hall with a wide flight of steps projecting from the middle 
of the eastern side. It is, by itself, a noble conception and appears 
to have been exquisitely decorated by borders and panels in glazed 
tiles. Its fairly substantial dome, harmoniously picked up by the 
three domes of the sanctuary at the back, adds to the coherence of 
the design. Two other subsidiary entrances of smaller dimensions 
are also provided in the north. 

Like many of the mosques at Delhi, the Jami‘ Masjid (Fig. 37) at 
Mandu is raised over a lofty plinth with a series of arcaded chambers 
in front. The courtyard in the interior, a square of 162 feet, is sur¬ 
rounded on all the four sides by arched cloisters. These cloisters 
(Fig. 38) are all of the same design, with the only difference, that 
while the eastern cloister has only two aisles, the northern and 
southern have three each, and the prayer chamber on the west, five. 
The last is further distinguished externally by three large domes—one 
over the central compartment containing the principal mihrab and 
one over each of the royal galleries at the rear corners. Besides these 
three large domes, a number of small cylindrical cupolas, corres¬ 
ponding to the interspaces formed by the division of the cloisters 
into bays and aisles, compose the entire formation of the roof. On 
each side of the courtyard, the arcaded frontage of eleven bays con¬ 
stitutes a pleasing composition characterized by breadth and spacious¬ 
ness, while the interiors of the cloisters (Fig. 39) present an impres¬ 
sive effect of solemn dignity on account of the repeating rows of 
arcades, one within the other. There is very little ornament or 
relief in the building. Its chief qualities are balance and measured 
movement. But still the effect is not one of barren vacuity. The 
courtyard presents a fine panorama of arcaded bays, and the facade 
with its arcades and harmoniously proportioned porticos is aglow 
with judicious treatment of the constituent elements of graceful 
lines, curves and planes. 

The remarkable Durbar hall, known as the Hindola Mahall 131 
(Fig. 40), is usually attributed to Hushang, and its general style and 


704 


ART 


appearance lends support to this attribution. “Few buildings in 
India”, says, Percy Brown, “present a more striking appearance, or 
are more solidly constructed than this amazing pile.” 132 In spite of 
its massiveness, few, again, create such an illusion of swaying light¬ 
ness. In plan it is shaped like the letter t T\ the stem of the ‘T’ form¬ 
ing the main hall and the cross constituting a group of apartments 
in two storeys. Externally the building is 156 feet in length and 56 
feet in width, the transverse bar of T being 112 feet. The inordi¬ 
nately thick walls batter in a pronounced manner, and the illusion 
of swaying, thus created, has given the structure its curious name, 
the Hindola Mahall or the ‘swinging palace’. There are six deeply 
sunk arched openings on each of the longer sides of the hall, and 
three similar ones in the front wall. Each of these openings con¬ 
tains a doorway below and a window above; the arch-heads of the 
doorways and the windows seem to have been originally screened 
by delicate traceries. The interior (Fig. 41) is one large hall with 
an uninterrupted space, measuring 95 feet by 25 feet and 32 feet 
high, with five boldly fashioned wide ogee arches seemingly support¬ 
ing the flat roof. The transverse section, forming the cross bar of 
£ T’, differs from the main hall in being two-storeyed. The interior 
arrangement of each storey is also a little more intricate. The 
ground storey has a cruciform gallery ending in an archway opening 
on to the main hall, while the upper, which overlooks the main hall, 
consists of two compartments, the one rectangular and the other 
placed transversely on its side. The transverse section is further 
relieved by oriel windows on its free sides. The neatly chiselled 
masonry gives to the building a very graceful appearance on the 
outside, which is further enhanced by its plain battering walls of 
smooth texture, wide archways of noble proportions, continuous 
eave supported on brackets, and oriel windows forming elegant 
balconies. A decidedly dignified effect may also be recognized in 
the fine sweep of the interior with its bold ogee-shaped arches. The 
Hindola Mahall, although a curious structure, is not without a paral¬ 
lel in India, and an almost exact copy may be found in the fort at 
Warangal, built about fifty years later. 

Opposite the Jami c Masjid, the large structural complex, known 
as the Ashrafi Mahall, 133 comprises a group of buildings succes¬ 
sively built in course of a rather long period. The original nucleus 
seems to have been a madrasa building, erected as an adjunct to 
the Great Mosque, possibly during Hushang’s reign. It was a struc¬ 
ture of one storey, designed in the form of ranges of halls and apart¬ 
ments round a spacious open court. Subsequent building operations 
at the site enveloped a large portion of this structure, and only 
a part consisting of an arched corridor with ranges of chambers 

705

THE DELHI SULTANATE 


at the back can now be seen. During the reign of Mahmud Khalji 
the madrcisa building was converted into an elaborate terrace to 
support the mausoleum of that sovereign. By filling up the madrasu 
court was obtained an immense plinth, in the centre of which was 
erected the royal mortuary chamber. A grand flight of steps in the 
west, projecting from the front of the madrasa, led to a pillared 
portico, and the entire conception of such an approach with arched 
loggias on either side is at once imposing and impressive. Only 
fragments of the tomb chamber now remain. The madrasa 
quadrangle had a bastion at each corner. The north-eastern bastion 
was subsequently developed into a lofty tower by Mahmud Khalji 
to commemorate his victory over Rana Kumbha of Chitor. Built 
of a greenish marble-like stone it rose up to seven storeys (Haft 
Manzil), each being distinguished by a projected balcony, as Jahan¬ 
gir refers to in his Memoirs. An ambitious project, as it was, it 
must have presented a spectacular appearance, when entire. It is 
not unlikely that the conception was inspired by the celebrated 
victory tower of Rana Kumbha at Chitor, built slightly earlier to 
commemorate the defeat of the Malwa Sultan by the Rana. The 
Sultan, in his turn, erected his own triumphal column as a reply to 
that of his rival. But while Kumbha’s tower still stands after a 
lapse of five centuries, the greater portion of the Miandu tower has 
collapsed, apparently because of its poorer construction. 

According to Firishta the tomb of Hushang 134 was built by 
Mahmud Khalji, “but considerations of style”, Marshall observes, 
“are in favour of Hushang himself having been the author”. 135 It 
is probable, however, that it was begun by Hushang and completed 
by Mahmud. The tomb (Fig. 42) stands behind the Jcimi‘ Masjid in 
the centre of a square enclosure, which is approached through a 
domed portico on the northern side. The west end of the court is 
occupied by a colonnade divided into three aisles, with a narrow 
rectangular hall at the back and a smaller hall at each end. In the 
centre of the extensive courtyard stands the mausoleum building—a 
square structure supported on a broad plinth and surmounted by a 
large central dome with an engaged cupola at each corner. The plinth 
is 100 feet each side and the building itself 86 feet each way. There 
is an arched doorway flanked by two smaller screened windows on 
the south, while on the north there are three similar trellised 
windows. The walls, diversified by a stylobate, horizontal bands of 
masonry over the arched passage and screens, and projecting eaves 
on brackets and battlemented crestings, rise to a height of over 
31 feet. The height of the dome, which has a circumference of 
about 170 feet, is 40 feet above its base. Although built with a white 
marble facing, the surface of which is relieved with fine trellised 


706 


ART 


archways and occasional passages of colour, the tomb has the appear¬ 
ance of “a stolid and sombre pile”. 136 To a certain extent, again, 
it lacks elevation and poise because of the shortness of the drum 
which supports the dome. The later mausoleum buildings such as 
the tomb of Darya Khan, 137 the Dai ka Mahall, 138 the Chhappan 
Mahall, 139 etc., built on the same design, profit by this initial 
example, and although of smaller dimensions, they exhibit a far 
greater sense of balance and harmony. 

A long structural complex, situated between two lakes, known 
as the Kapur Talao and the Munja Talao, has certainly a romantic 
setting. Because of its situation it seems to float in water like a 
ship and it is probably this that has suggested the curious name, 
the Jahaz Mahall 140 (Fig. 43) or the Ship-Palace, for the complex. It 
is a long and massive structure, some 360 feet in length along the 
water front, the width, including the thickness of the walls, being 
less than 50 feet. The lower section of the building has a fine arched 
fagade beautifully aligned along the water front on each side. The 
central archway in the eastern fagade, which forms the principal en¬ 
trance to the interior, is set forward a little and is distinguished by 
a marble pilaster on each side. This is surmounted by an overhang¬ 
ing pavilion topped by a vaulted pyramidal roof. Over the arch¬ 
ways of this fagade there runs a broad eave supported on brackets, 
and over the eave there are battlemented crestings picked up in gla¬ 
zed tiles. The interior has a complement of three longitudinal 
halls separated by transverse compartments. The halls are covered 
by flat vaults supported on massive arches, while the compartments 
have each a barrel-vaulted roof. At the back of the central hall and 
over the Munja Talao projects a square pavilion in two storeys, the 
upper being covered by a dome. At the northern end there is a 
large reservoir of pleasing design with colonnades all around. From 
the western colonnade a flight of stairs 141 leads up to the roof 
which is an immense terrace, 205 feet by 48 feet, commanding an 
excellent view of the surrounding plateau. At either end of the 
terrace there is a rectangular pavilion roofed by a domical vault in 
the centre and a pyramidal one on each side. In design as well as 
in construction, the building thoroughly expresses an excellent taste 
and high technical skill. The fine arched halls of the complex, the 
airy kiosks and pavilions of various shapes and groupings on the 
roof, all illustrate a joyous and hilarious mode, in keeping with the 
pleasant surroundings of this beautiful structure. It has an effect 
which presents a strong contrast to the solid dignity of the buildings 
already mentioned. Though the date of its construction is not defi¬ 
nitely known, its general style is in accord with the pleasure-loving 
character of Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Khalji, the builder of Turkish 


707 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


baths and other structures designed to increase the luxurious 
amenities of the royal palaces. 

The other buildings that merit attention in this vast conglo¬ 
meration of ruins are associated with the names of Baz Bahadur 
and Rupamati whose romantic tales of love still echo through every 
vale and dale of Mandu. A lonely building on the slope of a hill 
by the side of the Riwa Kund in the southern part of the plateau 
is known to the local people as Baz Bahadur’s Palace, 142 though, 
according to an inscription, it was built by Sultan Nasir-ud-din, son 
of Ghiyas-ud-dln Khalji, in 914 A.H (A. D. 1508-09). Apparently 
because of its picturesque situation, Baz Bahadur had taken a fancy 
to it and used it as his own favourite residence. From the Riwa Kund 
a long flight of forty steps with several landings leads up to the 
palace which is a pleasingly designed structure of two quadrangular 
compositions of arcaded cloisters, preceded in front by an outer 
court with a gateway portal. The bigger quadrangle consists of a 
spacious court with ranges of apartments (Fig. 44) in the cloisters 
around and, in the centre, a beautiful square reservoir with flagged 
steps in the middle of each side. The southern cloister, which is in a 
comparatively fair state of preservation, consists of a long rectangu¬ 
lar hall divided into three bays by squat arches supporting the 
vaulted ceiling. At either end of this hall are a couple of rooms, 
while at its back is a long flat-roofed apartment from which a flight 
of steps descends down to the second quadrangle. This is of smaller 
dimensions and is surrounded by similar arcaded cloisters, that to 
the south being double-aisled. A flight of steps in the thickness of 
the wall of the northern section of this quadrangle leads up to the 
spacious terrace having two beautiful open pavilions at the north¬ 
east and north-west angles. Apart from its picturesque situation, 
the building has very little architectural grandeur, and belongs evi¬ 
dently to the period of decline when the Mandu style had lost much 
of its forcefulness and energy which characterized its earlier phase. 

The building associated with the name of Rupamati 143 stands 
on the southern edge of the plateau and, as its situation and form 
indicate, was, in all probability, designed for military purposes. The 
nucleus of the building seems to have been a low but massive hall 
with a room at either end. The arcaded walls batter considerably 
and terminate in battlemented crestings. The batter of the walls 
reminds one of the Tughluq buildings at Delhi, and the characteristic 
Tughluq fashion is already expressed at Mandu in the Hindola Ma- 
hall. This part of the complex, it is possible, goes back to the days of 
Hushang or to a period slightly later. At a subsequent date, along 
the slope of the hill, supporting the original block, was added a base- 


708 


ART 


ment, with arms projecting from its northern and southern ends, 
respectively, towards the east and the west. The walls of the base¬ 
ment also batter like those of the original block. This later complex 
is also composed of arcaded halls, that in the western arm containing 
a large reservoir in the interior. It was probably at this period 
that an open pavilion covered by fluted dome (Fig. 45) was built 
over the terraced roof of the original block at either end. It is these 
pavilions overlooking the plains of the Narmada that are particular¬ 
ly associated with the fair name of Rupamatl. 

Many other monuments, in various stages of preservation, still 
stand at Mandu, but it is not possible to take account of all these in 
the compass of a short chapter. The above representative exam¬ 
ples will give an idea of the architectural grandeur of the place, and 
will no doubt indicate that the monuments were fully in accord 
with the marvellous natural surroundings amidst which they were 
placed. The lofty plinth and the stately flights of ascending steps 
give a notable dignity and substance to these buildings, while the 
arcaded facades show a judicious distribution of solids and voids. 
In the use of sandstone of a lovely red shade, freely picked up by 
marble and other kinds of tinted stones, and the embellishment by 
encaustic tiles to enliven the whole, the Mandu builders evinced a 
rare sense of colour, which takes a prominent part in the architec¬ 
tural scheme and forms an inseparable constituent in agreement 
with the pageantry of colour that meets the eye all around. 

D. Gujarat 

Among the different provincial forms of Indo-Muslim architec¬ 
ture that of Gujarat is admittedly the most remarkable, as no other 
architectural style tells the tale of the fusion of Hindu and Muslim 
building traditions with such unmistakable distinctness. As noted 
above, Gujarat was first conquered by the Muslims during the rule 
of ‘Ala-ud-din Khalji. It was certainly a fortunate coincidence that 
Gujarat came in contact with the Muslim building tradition when 
it had attained its brilliant expression at Delhi under that Sultan. 
Equally fortunate is the fact that in this territory the tradtions of 
a pre-existing indigenous school were still strong and vigorous. 144 
Characterized by a breadth and spaciousness, so unusual in pre- 
Muslim days, and with its chaste and graceful elegance, this style 
had all the necessary elements to satisfy Muslim taste. Further, 
the innate skill of the Gujarati artists and craftsmen in the manipu¬ 
lation of the purely decorative elements brought their style very 
close to Muslim ideals of good architecture. In no other country 
or territory could the circumstances be more favourable for a happy 


709 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


! 


blending of two alien architectural traditions. These fortunate 
conditions led to the growth and development of a distinct and 
individual style under the fostering care and zeal of the Muslim 
Sultans who ruled over Gujarat as independent potentates for nearly 
two centuries. 144a 

The foundations of the new style may be said to have been laid 
already in the fourteenth century when Gujarat had not yet broken 
away from its allegiance to Delhi. In the earliest period of occupa¬ 
tion, the Muslim governors, as elsewhere, used native materials 
along with native builders and craftsmen, and some form of struc¬ 
tural conversion may actually be noticed in the Tomb of Shaikh 
Farid and the Adina or Jami‘ Masjid , 145 both at Patan (Anahila- 
pattana). These two represent, more or less, improvised composi¬ 
tions with materials from earlier Hindu and Jain temples. The 
Jdmi c Masjid at Broach, 146 though improvised in a similar manner, 
was assembled according to the typical mosque plan with a quadran¬ 
gular court having three entrances on the three sides and the 
sanctuary at the western end. Moreover, an improvement of the 
design is recognized in the care with which older materials have 
been adjusted for fitting them in the conventional mosque design. 
There is, however, very little attempt to impose any Muslim idea 
on the new building, except the minimum necessitated by Islamic 
conventions. This is particularly noticeable in the open-pillared 
fagade of the sanctuary. The arched facade, which is almost a 
ritualistic convention with Islamic religious buildings, is found to 
be absent, not only in this early improvization but in many of the 
later mosques belonging to the phase of original construction. 

The Jami e Masjid at Cambay, 147 erected in A.D. 1325, may be 
regarded as a typical building of the early phase of Gujarat Muslim 
architecture (Fig. 46). It has all the appurtenances that Islam de¬ 
mands—cloisters, open courtyard, the entrance porches, the covered 
place for prayer in the western cloister with the mihrab and the 
mimbar —, but only the west end is in any sense Islamic. The pillars 
of the cloisters are, no doubt, relics from sacked Hindu and Jain 
shrines. In the entrance porches, which also seem to have come prin¬ 
cipally from older temples, there are many things that may fairly be 
described as literal copies of Hindu work as distinctive units in the 
established plan of a Muslim mosque. The exact parallels of these 
porches may be seen in the mandapas of Hindu and Jain shrines, 
still standing, for instance, at Modhera and Mount Abu. The 
Cambay mosque is further important, as here, along with evidence 
of spoliation of earlier buildings, a stage of synthesis between the 
two building traditions is clear and manifest. The sanctuary at the 


no 


ART 


western end, instead of being open-pillared, like the masjid at 
Broach, has an arched fagade in the manner of conventional mosques. 
Moreover, the alternately narrow and broad courses of masonry 
proclaim a familiarity with the Islamic building tradition at Delhi, 
and the prominent central arch has a distant Persian affiliation. 
The arches, however, are constructed on the Hindu trabeate prin¬ 
ciple, and the engrailed arch between the two front pillars of the 
central bay is distinctly of temple extraction. This last element, it 
should be emphasized, is to figure prominently in the shape of a 
graceful flying arch within the central openings of the fagades of 
the mosques of the subsequent phases. With its elegant proportions 
and dignified form, the Cambay masjid is the first example of an 
intelligible mosque design in Gujarat, and may be said to have set 
the standard for the subsequent monuments to follow. It elo¬ 
quently announces the beginning of a fruitful contact between two 
potent architectural traditions that ultimately led to the growth and 
development of a new and distinctive style. 

The Mosque of Hilal (or Buhlul) Khan Kazi 148 at Dholka, 
(Fig. 47), erected slightly later (A.D. 1333), is of the same character 
as the Cambay mosque. It is of smaller dimensions, but two orna¬ 
mental turrets, one on either side of the central archway of the 
sanctuary facade, add a notable innovation and complete the typical 
mosque design of Gujarat. Indigenous in design as well as in work¬ 
manship, these turrets anticipate, in a way, the tall slender minarets 
of later Gujarat mosques. It is to be observed however that the 
Gujarat architects, possibly because of their unfamiliarity with the 
ideas and intentions of the minarets, have never been successful in 
the manipulation of this important element of the mosque design. 
The Tanka Musjid, 149 also at Dholka and built about A.D. 1361, is 
generally of the same order as the preceding, but being of the open- 
pillared variety bears a predominantly Hindu appearance. 

With Ahmad Shah I began the great period of Gujarat Muslim 
architecture. This forceful personality ascended the throne in 
A.D. 1411, and commemorated this event by founding a new capital 
city, called Ahmadabad after him. He began beautifying his new 
city with magnificent and stately edifices. Inspired by his zeal, his 
successors, as well as nobles and officers of the court, erected mos¬ 
ques, tombs and other structures. Ahmadabad, to quote Firishta, 
was turned into “the handsomest city in Hindustan and perhaps in 
the whole world.’’ 

A few mosques at Ahmadabad, undertaken during the early 
part of Ahmad Shah’s reign, may be said to have prepared the way 


711 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


for the grand Jami‘ Masjid, described by Fergusson as '"one of the 
most beautiful mosques in the East”. 150 Ahmad Shah’s mosque 151 
within the citadel (Figs. 48, 50) seems to have been the earliest in 
this series. It was modelled on the Jdmi‘ Masjid of Cambay, but 
with indications of a slight advance in the treatment of the buttresses 
on two sides of the central archway. The mosque of Haibat Khan 152 
(Fig. 49) belongs to the same type, but the prominent bastions on the 
exterior of the back wall of the sanctuary reproduce a distinctive 
feature of the Firuzian style at Delhi. The mosque of Sayyid ‘Alam, 153 
said to have been built in A.D. 1412, contains several instructive 
elements, including the provision of an intermediate storey in the 
shape of a triforium, all of which anticipate distinctive features of the 
style that is to reach its full expression in the grand Jdmi c Masjid. 

The far-famed Jdmi‘ mosque at Ahmadabad 154 (Fig. 51), erected 
in A.D. 1423, is justly regarded as the touchstone of the Gujarat 
Muslim style. It occupies a quadrangle, 382 feet by 258 feet exter¬ 
nally, and has four cloisters on four sides of the open courtyard, 255 
feet by 220 feet. It is in the western cloister (Figs. 52, 53), i.e. the 
sanctuary proper, that the most instructive and distinctive features 
are found. This consists of an immense hypostyle hall, 210 feet by 
95 feet internally, with 260 tall pillars closely and carefully spaced 
to form a series of square bays. The number of such bays is fifteen, 
each being covered by a dome. The central portion of the nave 
rises in the form of a tall shaft—a rotunda except for its square and 
octagonal shape in the lower and upper stages—literally in three 
storeys as the area around the shaft in the upper section is disposed 
in two balustraded galleries, one above the other, with richly carved 
traceries around. The aisle on either side of the nave is similarly 
disposed, except that, being planned with a lesser height, it has only 
one upper gallery. The extreme wings are each one-storeyed, ex¬ 
cept for the hanging gallery for the zandna in the northern end. 
Apart from the richly carved pillars and galleries, the latter in the 
form of clerestoreys deflecting and reflecting light in the interior, 
much of the elegant effect of the interior has been obtained by the 
differing heights of the successive compartments. 

■ This scheme of division and diversification is likewise repeated 
in the facade which not only has a pyramidal effect leading step by 
step from the two ends to the central nave, but exhibits also a 
variegated articulation in the arched and colonnaded schemes har¬ 
moniously combined. The former, occupying the middle, has a 
large central archway forming the entrance to the nave, flanked on 
two sides by two smaller ones leading to the two aisles. The central 
archway springs from two richly moulded buttresses which once 


712 


ART 


supported minarets that have now collapsed. The arches of this 
middle division are elegantly spaced and balanced and have the 
most graceful outlines; and contrasted to this scheme is that of the 
two wings at the extreme ends formed of pillars with arch-shaped 
brackets and shaded at the top by sloping eaves. Percy Brown 
rightly notices in the entire scheme “a subtle contrast between the 
volume and strength of the wall surface and airy lightness of the 
colonnade” and declares the facade to be superb as a composition 
of solids and voids. 155 

The MmV Masjid at Ahmadabad, according to Percy Brown, 156 
ranks as “the high watermark of the mosque design in Western 
India, if not in the entire country”. In this monument the Gujarat 
Muslim architecture reaches a rational development by assimilat¬ 
ing intellectually the lessons derived from the buildings of the 
earlier phase of experiments. The phenomenal advance achieved 
in this superb creation owes, no doubt, a good deal to the apprecia¬ 
tive patron who seems to have been a genius gifted with a fine and 
elegant taste and a lofty vision as well. The most eminent features 
of the monument would bear recapitulation: The interior with its 
diversified sections and its array of graceful pillars is splendid, and, 
further, with its richly carved galleries, its rich and intricate trace¬ 
ries and arabesques the effect is chaste and at the same time elegant. 
The admirable composition of the fagade, broken up and diversified 
with all its well-proportioned parts, its shapely and expansive 
arches, its engaged buttresses richly moulded, its carved mouldings, 
string-courses and battlements, all combine to make it one of the 
noblest architectural compositions in the whole world. 

Much of the composition of this magnificent structure was cer¬ 
tainly the handiwork of indigenous craftsmen and derived from the 
Western Indian temple style. Some scholars find in the stepped 
pyramidal composition an echo of the pyramidal lines of the Indian 
temple. While there may be divergences of opinion on this point, 
there can be no doubt that the form of the pillars, of the buttresses 
flanking the central archway, and the decorative detail as a whole 
are Indian. The domes, too, are built up in the indigenous trabeate 
system. The extreme wings, too, reproduce the indigenous princi¬ 
ple. These features exerted a permanent influence on the Gujarat 
Muslim style, and all are repeated in the subsequent buildings, 
“though seldom with better effect than here”. 

It is interesting in this connection to refer to Fergusson’s com¬ 
parison between the Jami‘ Masjid at Ahmadabad and the great 
temple at Ranpur, some 160 miles away, which was being built at 
about the same time by Rana Kumbha of Mewar. Fergusson’s 


713 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


observation that both the monuments belong to the same school of 
architectural design is clear and unequivocal. He feels, however, 
that there is more poetry in the temple, but concludes that “there is 
a sobriety about the plan of the mosque which, after all, may be in 
better taste”. 157 

The Tin Darwdza ]5S or ‘Triple Gateway’ (Fig. 54), forming the 
main entrance to the outer enclosure of the royal citadel, belongs 
apparently to Ahmad Shah’s reign, and is a production of rare archi¬ 
tectural dignity. It consists of three archways of equal height, the 
central one, however, being of wider dimensions than the other 
two. The arches are bold in conception and graceful in outline and 
are delicately set off against richly carved buttresses projecting from 
the front of each pier. Another notable feature may be recognized 
in the relief given to the parapet on each side by three elegant oriel 
windows supported on brackets. 

Muslim architecture in Gujarat may be said to have reached 
its characteristic expression in the reign of Ahmad Shah; during the 
next two reigns the quality of the style was maintained unimpaired. 
His successor, Muhammad Shah, is also known to have been a 
builder of note. He completed the tomb of Ahmad Shah 159 in an 
enclosure to the east of the Jami‘ Masjid specially marked out 
by that greater ruler. Further east, the Rdm-kd-Hujva, 160 or the tomb 
enclosure for the royal ladies was also apparently completed during 
his reign. The tomb of Ahmad Shah is a square building with a 
portico projecting from the middle of each side, the southern one 
forming the entrance. Within each corner between the projections 
is a small square chamber covered by a dome. Between the cham¬ 
bers are pillared aisles enclosing the tomb chamber which is covered 
by a large single dome. The aisles are closed from without by per¬ 
forated stone screens. Though not of very great architectural merit, 
particularly in its present environments, the tomb is nevertheless 
important as it introduced a funerary type which came to be popular 
in this part of the country. The Rdm-kd-Hujrd consists of a square 
open court enclosed by an arched screen with columned cloisters 
both inside and out. On a platform within the court are arranged 
richly carved and lavishly inlaid cenotaphs which in their refined 
grace and elegance may be said to have been fitting memorials to the 
pretty damsels of the royal harem. 

At Sarkhej, about six miles to the south-west of Ahmadabad, 
Muhammad Shah built the tomb (Fig. 55) and mosque of Shaikh 
Ahmad Khattri, a famous Muslim saint who died in A.D. 1446. Thus 
was initiated a building activity at this place which was later to 
levelop into an architectural complex of no mean artistic significance. 


714 


ART 


The tomb of the Shaikh consists of a square chamber in the centre 
with a concentric series of four aisles separated one from the other 
by slender pillars. The central chamber is covered by a large single 
dome and the aisles by smaller domes over the bays formed by the 
arrangement of the pillars in the aisles. On the outside the aisles 
are closed by stone lattices, while panels of brass “fretted and cha¬ 
sed and tooled into an infinite variety of patterns” 161 separate the 
tomb chamber from the aisles. The entire composition occupies a 
square of 104 feet side and is the largest of its kind in Gujarat. The 
mosque, as a whole, partakes of the usual design, but the sanctuary 
is of the open-pillared variety and is of the same height throughout. 
The absence of the formal arched facade and of the minars probably 
detracts, to a certain extent, from its character as a sanctuary. As 
an architectural composition, however, it is of considerable interest 
on account of its chaste simplicity and classic restraint. 

The brief reign of Qutb-ud-din, the next ruler, is not also a blank 
in respect of building activities. He is the author of the Hauz-i-Qutb 
Tank at Kankariya 162 in the vicinity of Ahmadabad, and the builder 
of a mosque at Ahmadabad, called Qutb-ud-din mosque 163 after him. 
Though neither is of great architectural merit, the first at least is 
an expression of the pleasure-loving tendency of the ruler. He is 
also reputed to have built a mosque and a tomb at Rajapur in 
memory of Sayyid Buddha bin Yaqut. 164 These two, combined to 
form a rauza, were designed on a considerable scale, but failed to be 
a convincing production. In the mosque certain innovations are 
noticed in the arched formation of the wings in place of the custo¬ 
mary open pillars. But the central bay with its heavy minarets 
seems to be too overpowering, and out of all proportion to the rest 
of the fagade. But if the buildings associated with the name of the 
ruler failed to be inspiring, two monuments, one at Ahmadabad and 
the other at Dholka, erected during his reign by his officials, seem 
to suggest new trends. The tomb of Darya Khan 165 at Ahmadabad, 
(Fig. 56), bearing the date A.D. 1453, and the mosque of Alif Khan 166 
at Dholka (Fig. 57) seem to have many things in common and are per¬ 
meated by the same spirit; Percy Brown 167 is inclined to believe that 
they were works of the same hand. Both these monuments were built 
of bricks, instead of stone, and naturally arches constitute the 
principal feature of the composition in each case. The Dholka 
mosque is damaged to a very great extent, but the tomb of Darya 
Khan is in a fair state of preservation. It consists of a square tomb 
chamber surrounded by an arcaded corridor, the central chamber 
being covered by a large dome and the corridor by smaller ones, the 
domes in each case being supported on arched squinches. For 


715 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


this reason some scholars presume in the structural procedure an 
impact of the Persian architectural tradition. There can be no 
doubt that due to the limitations of the material used in these build¬ 
ings, the arch was used more as a structural expedient than as a cons¬ 
cious adoption of an Islamic principle. It is true also that after 
this the arch is found to be increasingly employed in Gujarat. It 
cannot be denied, however, that the Gujarati builders were more at 
home with their own traditional trabeate system and more used to 
think in terms of pillar and lintel. It appears, therefore, that 
whenever they had to use the arch they accepted it rather grudgingly. 

The famous ruler, Mahmud Begarha (A.D. 1458-1511), was a pas¬ 
sionate builder, and it was during his reign that the Gujarat Muslim 
style reached its most sumptuous expression. His architectural 
undertakings were many and varied, and distributed throughout his 
dominions. He founded three new cities and adorned each with 
many splendid edifices. Of these, Champaner, about seventy-eight 
miles to the south-east of Ahmadabad, was designed to be the capital 
city, and was planned and completed on a grand and lavish scale 
befitting its exalted position. Ahmadabad, the old capital and 
already a city of great architectural magnificence, was not ignored, 
and received further embellishments in the shape of new and state¬ 
ly buildings. Again, at Sarkhej was raised a vast palace complex with 
gardens, pavilions, artificial lakes, etc., besides other monuments on 
the same lavish scale. Of these the secular monuments have suffer¬ 
ed a good deal, but mosques and tombs that now remain furnish 
an ample idea of the sumptuous character of Begarha architecture. 
The mosques, with very few exceptions, follow the pattern already 
established. In the tomb designs different modes may be noticed. 
A sumptuous wealth of decorative detail distinguishes every monu¬ 
ment of this phase, whether a mosque or a tomb. 

Among the surviving monuments of this phase many take the 
shape of what is usually known as a rauza , ie. a tomb and mosque 
combined to form one conception. The mosque in such a scheme 
has usually no arched facade, but is of the open-pillared variety. 
The tomb usually takes the form of a square mortuary chamber en¬ 
circled by a number of aisles, sometimes with a projecting portico 
in front. The pattern is already known in the earlier phase. The 
tomb of Sayyid Usman (A.D. 1460) 168 at Usmanpur, a suburb of 
Ahmadabad on the opposite side of the river Sabarmati, is one of 
the earlier monuments of this kind belonging to the Begarha period. 
It is a well-balanced production consisting of a square mortuary 
chamber inside a double aisle of pillars. This chamber is covered 
by a substantial dome resting on a dodecagonal base over twelve 


716 


t 


ART 




pillars skilfully arranged in the centre of the hall. This dome is 
surrounded by smaller domes over the outer aisle. The concentric 
arrangement of a number of aisles, one within the other, already 
noticed in a hesitating form in earlier tomb compositions ? has reach¬ 
ed here a logical and rational expression. In its harmonious pro¬ 
portions, in the skilful disposition of its parts, and in its breadth 
and spaciousness, it ranks as one of the most successful sepulchral 
designs carried out in the pillared style at Ahmadabad. Two other 
eminent productions of this mode may be seen in the tombs of BIbi 
Achut Kuki 169 (A.D. 1472) (Fig. 58) at Ahmadabad and of Mahmud 
Begarha 170 at Sarkhej. 

Fundamentally the above tomb design undergoes very little 
modification, except that the arch comes to be increasingly used in 
the composition, as seen in a number of mausoleums in Gujarat. The 
tomb of Shah ‘Alam 171 (c. A.D. 1475) near Ahmadabad (Fig. 60), 
built on the same scheme as above, has an outer arcade filled in with 
perforated screens, and within this there is a colonnade encircling a 
square compartment, which was enclosed by traceries. This innermost 
traceried compartment forms the mortuary chamber which is covered 
by a dome. This concentric arrangement of a number of compart¬ 
ments, one within the other, and particularly the skilful and minute 
execution of the traceries lend the monument an almost casket-like 
appearance. In the Begarha period the arches are found to be in¬ 
creasingly applied in the composition of sepulchral monuments in 
a manner that leads to production of a new mode of tomb design. 
Among a number of tombs of arched composition, two merit special 
attention. One is the tomb of Qutfo-uTAlam 172 (c. A.D. 1480) at 
Batwa, some six miles to the south of Ahmadabad, and the other 
is that of Mubarak Sayyid 173 (c. A.D. 1484) at Mahmudabad (Fig. 59), 
about seventeen miles to the south-east of that famous city. The 
former is a large square building with a portico projecting from its 
southern end. Of the usual concentric arrangement, the exterior 
shows a double arcade encircling two inside aisles, again of arcaded 
formation. The inner aisle encloses the cenotaph chamber which 
rises in two storeys, the upper being surmounted by a fair-sized 
dome. In the conscious and consistent acceptance of the arcuate 
composition, and in its convincing application, this tomb represents 
no small advance on the earlier design. Stilly there are indications 
of a certain vacillation, usual, in the initial stage of every new mode. 

In the tomb of Mubarak Sayyid (Fig. 59), however, all signs of 
hesitancy disappear, leading to the creation of one of the most con¬ 
vincing monuments of this class. Though of slightly smaller dimen¬ 
sions, it is very much of the same design as the Qutb-ul ‘Alam tomb, 


717 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


and Fergusson 174 suspects that both were designed by the same archi¬ 
tect. Certain differences may, however, be noticed in the tomb of 
Mubarak Sayyid. Instead of being double-storeyed, like the Qutb- 
ul ‘Alam tomb, it is single-storeyed, though the elevation of the 
central compartment beyond the height of the surrounding aisles re¬ 
sults, in effect, in a simulated upper storey which is surmounted by 
a substantial dome. The contour and poise of this central dome have 
parallels in the Lodi monuments in far-off Delhq while the kiosks 
at its base, again representing a pleasing innovation, seem to have 
been derived from the same source. In view of the simplicity of 
its plan, the organic unity of its total design, the solidity and balance 
of its parts, and, above all ? its constructional proprieties, Fergusson 
describes it as one of the most beautiful of its class in India. 

A brief refernece may be made to a few more mosques. The 
mosque in the rauza of Sayyid Usman, 175 of the open-pillared scheme, 
is perhaps the earliest of the mosques to be erected during the 
Begarha period. Another specimen of the open-pillared scheme is 
the small, but exquisite, Ram Slpari mosque 176 at Ahmadabad, built 
in A.D. 1514. It stands by the side of the tomb of the same queen 
(Fig. 81). Except the minarets at the two ends of the pillared fron¬ 
tage the mosque has hardly anything Islamic about it, the design of 
all other important details being in the indigenous Indian tradition. 
In a way such a monument proves Fergusson’s 177 dictum regarding 
the Gujarat Muslim style that “as the style progressed it became 
more and more Indian”. The Rani Siparl mosque has been describ¬ 
ed by Fergusson as “the most exquisite gem at Ahmadabad”. 
Marshall also supports this estimate of Fergusson. “East or west”, 
says Marshall, ‘it would be difficult to single out a building in 
which the parts are more harmoniously blended or in which balance, 
symmetry and decorative rhythm combine to produce a more 
perfect effect. The mosque is a small one—only 48 feet by 19£ feet 
—but this very smallness is an asset in its favour, since the delicate 
traceries and jewel-like carvings of Gujarat, suggestive as they are 
of an almost feminine grace, show to less advantage in bigger and 
more virile structures.” 178 One other mosque of this type, but not 
so ornate in expression, is that of Shah Khub Sayyid 179 (A.D. 1538) 
at Ahmadabad. It is perhaps the latest example of this series. 

The type of mosque with an arched screen in front of the 
sanctuary is evidently modelled on the grand Jdmi c Masjid at 
Ahmadabad, but the combined arched and pillared frontage^ as seen 
in the archetype, soon disappears and gives place to a continuous 
arched facade along the entire front. The mosque of Miyian Khan 
Chlshtl 180 at Ahmadabad, built about A.D. 1465, is in design and 


718 


ART 


dimensions, an exact analogue of the mosque of Bibl Achut KukI 181 
(Fig. 62), also at Ahmadabad and built in A.D. 1472. The two 
together may be regarded as representing the style of the early 
Begarha period. The sanctuary in each has a three-arched screen with 
a richly sculptured minaret shooting high up on either side of the 
central archway. The interior, as usual, is a hypostyle divided into 
three compartments, each of which is surmounted by a dome. The 
compartment forming the nave is raised higher to form a clerestory 
over which is placed the central dome. In the entire design there is 
a clarity which, in each instance, enhances greatly the effect of the 
building. The tendency to increased richness, a characteristic of 
Begarhan architecture, is seen not only in the finer and more varied 
carvings on the buttresses of the minarets, but also in the attractive 
motif of the oriel windows projected from the exterior walls, each 
filled in with a tracery of exquisite design and fineness. This motif 
of the oriel window supported on brackets and shaded by a wide 
eave, and taking the shape, more or less, of a shallow balcony, is 
distinctly an adaptation of the earlier indigenous pattern, probably 
of secular origin. This motif, though occasionally used in the monu¬ 
ments of the earlier phase, now comes to be applied as a regular 
ornamental feature and with increased effect, and adds to the modu¬ 
lation and relief of the walls. 


The type seems to have set the pattern for the age and is found 
to be repeated, with hardly any variation in the design, till the 
absorption of the kingdom of Gujarat in the empire of Akbar. With 
the progress of the building activity there is recognized an increased 
enrichment by superb and the most delicate carvings. The mosque 
of Muhafiz Khan 182 (A.D. 1492) (Figs. 63, 64), Bal Harlr’s mosque 183 
(c. A.D. 1500) and the Queen’s mosque 184 (Fig. 65), also known as 
Rani Rupavati’s mosque (c. A.D. 1515), all at Ahmadabad, represent 
some of the ornate expressions of the prevailing style. Among these, 
the first is considered by competent critics to be a pre-eminent pro¬ 
duction on account of its exquisitely refined details executed in the 
most elegant and flawless taste. The Gujarati builders seem to have 
been perfect masters in the art of minute carving, and this art is 
found to be in its apogee in the magnificent tracery work of the SidI 
Sayyid mosque 185 at Ahmadabad belonging to the first quarter of the 
sixteenth century A.D. The mosque is rather a simple and unassum¬ 
ing building, and illustrates a distinct departure from the usual 
mosque design of Gujarat, A definite innovation, and an unusual 
one in the context of Gujarat, is furnished by an entirely arcaded 
interior of the sanctuary hall. But the fame and reputation of the 
mosque rest not so much on the originality or unconventionality of 


719 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


its design, as on its superb window screens (cf. Fig. 66) which fill in 
the tympanums of the arches. There are ten such screens—three in 
each of the two side walls and four in the rear wall of the sanctuary. 
Of these, the screens at the sides and the two in the extreme bays 
of the back wall are each cut up into small square panels which are 
filled in with foliate and geometric forms of varying designs. Gujarat 
has long been familiar with such a pattern of the tracery, and the 
skill in handling such a tracery and executing it on hard stone has 
been admirable enough, but the two screens on either side of the 
central mihrdb of the Sidi Sayyid mosque, surpass everything of 
the kind executed before. The pattern in each consists of Tree, 
plant and foliage designs’, intertwining with one another and evenly 
spread over the entire surface. “What makes these windows 
so supremely beautiful”, writes Marshall, “is the unerring sense for 
rhythm with which the artist has filled his spaces and the skill 
with which he has brought the natural forms of the trees into har¬ 
mony with their architectural setting.” 186 It is only an Indian 
genius with an extraordinary fertility of imagination that could revel 
in such a bewildering wealth of patterns, and only an Indian artist, 
gifted with an infinite technical skill arising out of a long heritage 
and tradition, who could carve it to such perfection. These traceries 
unmistakably prove that the tradition of the artists of the Dilwara 
temples was not yet extinct. 

In A.D. 1484 Mahmud Begarha captured Champaner from a 
Hindu chief and built a new capital city there. Among the surviv¬ 
ing monuments of this once splendid city, the most imposing is the 
Jdmi c Masjid {S1 (Fig. 67) which was completed in A.D. 1508. Model¬ 
led on its earlier namesake at Ahmadabad it is designed on much the 
same plan, though some variations in certain details may be recog¬ 
nized, for example, in the disposition of the facade and that of the 
roof. The fagade (Fig. 68) consists of five archways, each of a pointed 
shape, the central one inside the bases of the minarets being larger in 
dimensions. The roof of the nave rises much higher than those of the 
compartments on either side, which are of equal height throughout. 
The arrangement of the domes is also different. In the exterior 
(Fig. 71), as well as in the interior, the Champaner mosque exhibits a 
much richer effect. The stately entrance gateways (Fig. 70), leading 
to the mosque enclosure, with their varied and sumptuous carvings, 
add to the dignity and beauty of the scheme. The richer treatment 
of the enclosing walls, and particularly of those of the sanctuary, 
with richly moulded buttresses and oriel windows effectively relieves 
the monotony of the walls and betokens the affluent state of Begarha 
architecture. The tall nave of the sanctuiary rising up in three succes¬ 
sive tiers, with the sumptuous treatment of the clerestory galleries 


720 


ART 


and of the soffit of the central dome, poised high, provides the interior 
with an impressive dignity. 

Fergusson 188 has described the Jdmi e Masjid at Champaner as 
“architecturally the finest in Gujarat”, but this estimate is not un¬ 
animously accepted. However rich and accomplished its single 
parts and details might be, it falls short of the Jdmi‘ Masjid of 
Ahmadabad in respect of organic unity. As Marshall observes: 
“Its parts are neither so well proportioned nor so successfully co¬ 
ordinated. The elevation of the prayer chamber is too cramped; 
the minarets flanking the main archway overpoweringly heavy; and 
the transition from the side wings to the central hall altogether 
abrupt.” 189 What is this lack of organic design due to? Marshall 
attributed it to an exhaustion about this period of the faculty for 
composition on a grand scale which distinguished the architecture of 
Ahmad Shah. There may be some truth in such an explanation. 
But other forces might also have been at work. The increasing use 
of the arch and the dome is found to be a characteristic feature of 
Begarha architecture, indicating, perhaps, an increasing imposition 
of Islamic conventions. The Gujarati artists, who were no doubt 
responsible for the production of the monument, do not seem to 
have been as much at home with these structural methods as with 
their own traditional pillar and lintel system. It is just possible 
that the imposition of these not too familiar ideas might have some¬ 
thing to do with such drawbacks as a rather incoherent design and 
want of co-ordination in the otherwise splendid Jdmi‘ Masjid at 
Champaner. 

The difficulty felt by the Gujarati architects to adapt themselves 
to new techniques and new ideas is also illustrated in the minarets 
which never came to be fused into the mosque scheme as a happy 
and harmonious element. The Gujarati builders tried to mani¬ 
pulate them in different ways, but with very little success. In the 
arched type of mosque they v^ere placed on either side of the central 
archway } while in the open-pillared type they were relegated to the 
extreme corners of the facade. But whatever their position, they 
looked much too overpowering and heavy, particularly because of 
the prominent emphasis in the facade on the horizontal effect, thereby 
impairing the symmetry of the entire design. Even in the Jdmi e 
Masjid at Champaner which, in spite of the defects of composition 
mentioned above, is regarded as one of the splendid monuments of 
the Begarha period, the minarets look much too incongruous with 
the rest of the design. The disappearance of these features from the 
Jdmi ( Masjid or Rani Rupavati’s mosque at Ahmadabad may thus be 
regarded as architectural gains leading to superbly balanced and 

721 

D.S.—43 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


organic effect of the facade design. Some improvement was sought 
to be effected by reducing the height of the minarets and increasing 
that of the prayer chamber, as we find in the mosque of Muhafiz 
Khan at Ahmadabad, or by transforming them into mere ornamental 
and symbolic appendages of much reduced girth, as we find in the 
Rani Sipari mosque and in that of Shah Khub Sayyid, both at Ahma¬ 
dabad. No doubt, certain improvements resulted from such mani¬ 
pulations; yet the minarets failed to be successfully integrated into 
the scheme. It is not without reason that in a few of the later- 
mosques the minarets were altogether eliminated from the design. 

A close examination of the bases supporting the minarets is also 
instructive inasmuch as they are found to be derived from the earlier 
indigenous tradition. They project as prominent buttresses from 
the facade and correspond to the lower sections of the Hindu temple 
with all their characteristic mouldings along with vertical facets and 
rich decorative designs. They introduce an intricate play of light 
and shade in the otherwise hat fagade. Every form and every de¬ 
tail may be found at Siddhapur or Pa tan, Modhera or Mount Abu, 
Chandravati or Somaliatha. The variation is noticed only in one 
particular. Whereas in the corresponding sections of the temple ap¬ 
pear niches with figure sculptures, in the mosque they are filled in 
with tracery. And not a few of the tracery motifs are clearly of 
Hindu extraction. 

Another characteristic form of the Gujarat Muslim style ma}^ 
be seen in the step-wells, known as the wav. The practice of 
making these wells prevailed in the pre-Muslim period and the exist¬ 
ing tradition and mode of construction were taken over and consid¬ 
erably developed by the Muslim rulers. These wells consist of a 
circular or octagonal well-shaft and an inclined stairway which des¬ 
cends down to the level of the water by means of flights of steps with 
regular landings at intervals. The landings are constituted as pil¬ 
lared galleries which, superbly designed and provided with such 
ornamental features as hanging balconies, etc., served as cool and 
quiet retreats in the heat of the summer. Two of the most eminent 
examples of such step-wells are Bax Harir’s wav (Fig. 72) at 
Asarwa, 190 near Ahmadabad, and the one at Adalaj, 191 some twelve 
miles north of that city, both being built about the same time. 

The circumstances under which the Muslim style of Gujarat 
developed have been broadly stated above. In their building aspi¬ 
rations the Sultans of Gujarat were fortunate in coming in contact 
with a band of very highly accomplished Indian artisans with cen¬ 
turies of artistic tradition behind them. The Muslim rulers were 
not slow to recognize the merits of these artisans and take advan- 


722 


ART 


tage of their skill. What is more, with a rare catholicity they ab¬ 
stained from imposing their own ideas, beyond the barest minimum 
demanded by the new conditions, and were content to adhere to the 
established traditions of the country. The genius of the West- 
Indian temple-builders was thus easily directed to the creation of 
structures of an entirely disparate order in the form of mosques and 
tombs. And this they did with the same remarkable aesthetic and 
constructive sense as in the case of the temples. The fact that the 
inventive genius of the Indian craftsman had a comparatively free 
scope accounts for much of the imaginative richness of Gujarat 
Muslim architecture. Balance and harmony, elegance of design, 
richness of decoration, and almost flawless execution are the key¬ 
notes of this new style in which Indo-Muslim architecture may be 
seen at its best. It has been often stressed that of all the styles 
that emerged under Islamic rule in India, that of Gujarat remains 
the most indigenously Indian. This unique character may best be 
explained as the product as much of a highly specialized local style 
as of a different kind of Islamic patronage. 

E. The Punjab and the Deccan 

Besides the four provincial styles, noticed above, two other re¬ 
gional expressions of Indo-Xslamic architecture may also be recog¬ 
nized, one in the Punjab and the other in the Deccan. The former 
seems to have taken shape rather early; but the extant monuments 
are known to have undergone such large-scale renovations in succes¬ 
sive ages that the forms in which they are now seen cannot be dated 
earlier than the Mughul period. The Deccanese style is known to 
have asserted its individual character under the Bahmams, but the 
trends and forms illustrating this individuality reach their complete 
expressions only during the succeeding phase which was largely 
contemporaneous with the Mughul rule. A discussion of these styles 
is, therefore, reserved for the next volume. 

F. Rajputdna 

The establishment of Islam marked the close of a momentous 
epoch of Hindu architecture, the achievements of which have been 
recorded in the preceding volume. By A.D. 1350 Islam had esta¬ 
blished its authority over the greater part of India, as far south as 
the Krishna-Tufigabhadra basin. Under the shock of an alien rule 
and an alien faith the forceful Hindu styles felt stunned and ulti¬ 
mately disintegrated in the regions that lay prostrate. Certain ex¬ 
ceptions may, no doubt, be noted; but the general picture of Hindu 
architecture in the period under discussion may be described as one 


723 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


of decline. In Western India the traditional skill of the Hindu build¬ 
ers found a new expression in the Gujarat Muslim style. Raj- 
putana, which resisted for a long time the intrusion of Islam, seems 
to have maintained its former skill and tradition unimpaired to a 
large extent. The Kirttistambha 192 of Rana Kumbha (c. A.D. 1440) 
in Chitor fort is an eminent example of Rajput architecture of the 
fifteenth century A.D. It is a lofty and exquisitely ornamented tower 
rising up to a height of 122 feet in nine storeys, each storey being 
distinctly marked on the exterior. The successive tiers of projected 
balconies mingle judiciously with the elegant horizontal mouldings 
and build up a pattern which is further enriched by a profusion of 
architectural ornaments and figure sculptures. The mass of deco¬ 
ration, Fergusson rightly notes, “is kept so subdued, that it in no 
way interferes either with the outline or the general effect of the 
pillar.” 193 The pattern, as a whole, was certainly derived from an 
earlier tradition, and a prototype of this 'tower of fame’ may be seen 
in a smaller tower, 194 also at Chitor, which appears to have been 
built in the twelfth century. Rana Kumbha was a great patron of 
arts, and among his other architectural projects mention should be 
made of the great Chaumukha temple at Ranpur 195 (Jodhpur), which 
is extremely picturesque on account of its situation as well as of the 
varied composition of its superstructure, consisting of graceful 
domes and lofty spires commingling with one another and producing 
an effect of rich and romantic beauty. An ambitious conception, it 
consists of an immense number of parts of diverse shapes and 
designs, all pleasingly unified so as to produce a complete and organic 
whole. The variety and beauty of detail and the ever-changing play 
of light and shade in the interior create an impression seldom achieve- 
ed in buildings of this class. Such buildings as the above illustrate 
unmistakably the same efficiency and sense of balance and ornament 
that characterized the old Rajput art. 

In palace architecture, also, the Rajputs are known to have made 
notable contributions. The palaces, now surviving in Rajputana, 
were either built during the Mughul period, or were so remodelled 
that their earlier patterns have been mostly obliterated. Man Singh’s 
palace in the fort at Gwalior 196 (Fig. 69) has been considered to be 
one of the finest of the Hindu palaces belonging to the pre-Mughul 
times. Built at a date slightly prior to the advent of the Mughuls, 
it illustrates, more or less, an indigenous style in palace architecture, 
and it is from this style that Akbar is known to have derived many 
useful ideas when designing his own palaces at Agra, Fathpur 
Sikri and other places; as such it deserves more than a passing 
notice.

This remarkable and interesting example of an early Hindu 
palace is situated on the eastern scarp of the rock on which the fort 
stands. Externally, the dimensions are 300 feet by 150 feet, with 
a height of more than 80 feet on the eastern side. The flat surface is 
relieved on each face by tall rounded bastions of a singularly pleas¬ 
ing design, crowned by cupolas with domes of gilt copper, as Babur 
once saw them flashing in the bright sunlight. Between the bastions 
there appear elegantly designed projected balconies. The facades 
are gracefully embellished with bold patterns, plastic as well as glaz¬ 
ed. A singularly effective plastic design occupying the central divi¬ 
sion of the facade consists of a range of arcades with foliated struts. 
The glazed ornament in blue, yellow, and green, takes the shape of 
elegant bands of patterns with figures of men, elephants, tigers, birds, 
makaras, plantain trees, etc., and lends a charming and picturesque 
effect to the massive construction of the facades. Much of this 
ornament has decayed and peeled off. Yet, it represents a grand 
and ornate conception and we may quote an Englishman, Sir Lepel 
Griffin, Agent to the Governor-General for Central India; who saw 
it more than seventy years ago. “The palace,” he writes, “was once 
a mass of architectural and coloured ornament from base to summit. 
Even in its ruined state its fine projecting towers, open-pillared 
central balconies and arrow-headed crestings make up a most 
unique pile. Situated at a height of 300 feet from the ground be¬ 
low, on the rugged rock, its pinnacles standing out against the sky, 
every artistic detail throwing others into relief, the entire frontage 
one mass of colour, and the domes crowned with golden spires, the 
general effect must have been very fine.” 197 

The Hathiya Pol or the ‘Elephant Gate’, attached to the sou¬ 
thern end of the eastern frontage, is in itself a product of high 
artistic merit and is in keeping with the striking design of the 
palace building. It consists of a handsome domed structure with a 
massive bracket arch with rich corbels, the bracket shape being, to 
a certain extent, masked by two semi-circular bands of floral 
patterns. The sides are effectively diversified by projecting bal¬ 
conies, perforated screens, and particularly by two boldly project¬ 
ing rounded bastions, each roofed by a dome supported on pillars. 

The interior of the palace consists of two highly artistic open 
courts, each with a suite of rooms on its four sides. The courts are 
rather small in size, but in their rich treatment they are perhaps 
unsurpassed. Their smallness of scale and wealth of decorative 
detail, covering every available space, stand in significant contrast 
to the bold and massive conception of the exterior walls. It appears 
that these interior courts lacked the able guidance and supervision

of a master architect who might have planned and executed them in 
conformity with the noble and dignified conception of the outside. 
They are more the work of a decorator than of a builder. Yet, it 
contains many interesting features that are of a distinctly novel and 
ingenious character. The main body of the palace is divided into 
two storeys with additional underground floors along the eastern 
retaining wall for providing cool resorts in the hot weather. The 
open-pillared balconies in the uppermost floors overlook the open 
courts and add relief to the harsh four-square shape of the interior. 
The ingenuity of the builders is also shown in the different struc¬ 
tural expedients employed for the support of the roofs, and the 
vault over a room in the south-east angle with ribs at the groins 
lends a charming effect to the interior. The different shapes and 
designs of the corbelled struts and brackets and their execution, the 
variegated shapes and rich mouldings of the piers and pillars, the 
perforated screens of various patterns, the round and foliated arches 
and the variously designed projecting eaves, including one of corru¬ 
gated shape, are each a marvel of stone-carving, and the entire 
surfaces are covered with minute ornamentation in low relief and 
coloured glaze, lending a most picturesque effect to the view of the 
interior. In spite of the smallness of scale, Man Singh’s palace in 
the Gwalior fort furnishes us with a singularly pleasing conception, 
noble and dignified, and, at the same time, romantic and picturesque. 

G. Vijayanagara 

Reference has been made above to the establishment of the 
kingdom of Vijayanagara south of the Krishna. 198 Founded with 
the avowed object of checking Muslim aggression, this kingdom re¬ 
mained as a strong and effective bulwark of Hinduism against 
Muslim advance in the south for a little over two centuries. 
The capital city, Vijayanagara or the C city of victory’, situated 
on the south bank of the river T'ungabhadra, is now represented by 
the extensive ruins of Hampi. 199 In its palmy days it was one of 
the foremost cities in Asia, and glowing accounts of the power and 
prosperity of the kingdom and of the magnificence of the city have 
been left to us by a number of foreigners. Nicolo Conti, an Italian, 
and ‘Abd-ur-Razzaq, an ambassador from Shah Rukh, the son of 
Timur, visited Vijayanagara in the first half of the fifteenth century, 
while two Portuguese chroniclers, Domingo Pass and Fernao N'uniz, 
came and stayed in the city during the reign of Krishnadevaraya 
(A.D. 1509-29) when the kingdom was at the height of its prosperity. 
According to the testimony of ‘Alsd-ur-Razzaq the city of Vijaya¬ 
nagara occupied an area of about sixty-four square miles and had 


726 


ART 


seven concentric enclosures, each surrounded by strong fortifications. 
The three outer enclosures contained cultivable lands, while the four 
inner constituted the city proper, the royal palace and its precincts 
occupying the innermost quadrangle, the citadel proper. 200 The ac¬ 
count of Paes 201 is particularly valuable for obtaining an idea of the 
magnificence of this great city. To Paes the city seemed to be “as 
large as Rome and very beautiful to look at”. The palace of the 
king, he further states, enclosed “a greater space than all the castles 
of Lisbon.” Paes also refers to the strong and massive fortifications 
of the city, its imposing gateways, its wide streets lined by beauti¬ 
ful houses, its elaborate and effective works of irrigation, its 
orchards, groves and pleasaunees, its many temples, market places 
and other amenities suitable to a royal city. After the disastrous 
battle, known as the battle of Talikota (A.D. 1565), this splendid 
city fell a prey to the fury of the Muslims who wrought untold 
havoc and destruction. Yet, the remains that are still seen are 
significant as illustrating one of the most sumptuous phases of 
South Indian architecture. 

In this vast v/aste of ruins few secular buildings can now be 
seen intact. Nothing remains of the palace except the disfigured 
basements of a few of its buildings. Two masonry platforms, appa¬ 
rently of large and imposing structures, deserve special mention as 
they are likely to help one to have an idea of the chaste and elegant 
character of the buildings of this order. Of these, the one known 
as the King’s Audience Hall 202 seems to have been part of a build¬ 
ing of considerable dimensions. The other is called the Throne 
Platform 203 though Paes describes it as the ‘House of Victory’ 
erected by Krishnadevaraya in A.D. 1513 to commemorate his con¬ 
quest of Orissa. As the name of the first suggests, each was de¬ 
signed, very probably, as an audience hall, and Percy Brown is 
further inclined to describe them respectively as Halls of Public and 
Private Audiences in the manner of the palace designs in Persia and 
of the Mughuls. The original building in each instance seems to 
have been a pillared pavilion rising up in a number of storeys and 
ending in a pyramidal roof. c Abd-ur-Razzaq described the King’s 
Audience Hall as being “elevated above all the rest of the lofty 
buildings in the citadel.” The considerable dimensions of the base¬ 
ment lend support to such a description. The basement of this 
immense hall rises up in three spacious stages, diminishing as they 
go up, embellished by bold and chaste mouldings and string-courses, 
completely in agreement with the substantial nature of the building. 
Over the platform, which is reached by elaborate flights of steps, 
there may still be seen sockets of six rows 204 of pillars, ten in each, 


727 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


which supported the superstructure, now entirely gone. The Throne 
Platform is smaller in dimensions, but is decidedly the more 
ornate. Like the former, it also ascends in three diminishing 
terraced stages and is approached by balustrated stairways. The 
stages are separated one from the other by bold mouldings, the in¬ 
tervening wall surfaces being faced with elaborate carvings, depict¬ 
ing the various Puranic myths and legends. 

Because of the extremely fragmentary nature of the majority 
of the remains of the secular order it is difficult to understand 
clearly their designs and other arrangements. So far as can be 
judged, substance as well as ornament seem to have been the key¬ 
notes of such buildings. A few buildings of this order, each more 
or less in a fair state of preservation, may be seen in the Lotus 
Mahal, 205 the Elephant Stables, 206 and the two tower-like struc¬ 
tures called, perhaps wrongly, watch-towers of the Zanana enclo¬ 
sure 207 The first is a square pavilion with doubly recessed corners 
and in two storeys; the different compartments, in which the upper 
storey is disposed, are surmounted by pyramidal roofs. Except for 
the arches and their piers, every other feature from the base to the 
summit is modelled on the prevailing indigenous tradition, and 
Longhurst seems to be wrong in classing it as Indo-Islamic. Inci¬ 
dentally, the superstructure of this small pavilion may serve as a clue 
to the lost superstructures of the two audience halls mentioned above. 
The building, now called, perhaps wrongly, the Elephant Stables, is, 
however, more emphatically Islamic in appearance and character. It 
is an extremely elegant and dignified structure having the best of 
proportions. Its fine ranges of arches in the fagade, representing an 
entirely Islamic convention, are suitably balanced by the projected 
balconies on brackets 208 of the strict indigenous pattern. The 
graceful domes over the roof are again similarly counterbalanced by 
the square turret-like superstructure in the centre, apparently as¬ 
cending in diminishing storeys. Here, in this striking building the 
Islamic and the indigenous conventions may be seen to have been 
blended in a harmonious and organic manner. The two traditions 
are found to have adapted themselves successfully to each other. 
The two so-called watch-towers consist each of a tall and plain base 
supporting an upper storey with projected balconies on each side. 

The sumptuous character of the Vijayanagara style is, however, 
most evident in its temples. A new resurgence of Hindu mind 
appears to have taken place, and the temples erected during this 
period constitute certainly the most eloquent testimonies to this up¬ 
heaval. The static spell which seems to have spread over South 
Indian temple architecture is lifted, and a fresh inspiration is noticed 


ART 


not only in additions of new complements to the temple scheme, but 
also in a far greater enrichment of every element and feature. The 
temple enclosure is now provided with a larger number of struc¬ 
tures, apart from the main complex, such as pillared halls, pavilions 
and other shrines and adjuncts, and the increase in the number of 
such accessory buildings was no doubt necessitated by an elaboration 
of the rituals of worship. During this period two such accessory 
structures came to be regarded as indispensable elements in the 
temple scheme. One is known as the Amman shrine, which repre¬ 
sents a subsidiary temple for the enshrinement of the consort of the 
divinity to whom the principal temple in the centre of the scheme is 
consecrated. This subsidiary temple, a smaller replica of the principal 
one, is placed a little behind it in the north-west. The other is 
known as the Kalyana-mandapa, an open pillared pavilion with an 
elevated platform in the centre for the exhibition of the images of 
the deity and his consort on ceremonial occasions. It is situated a 
little to the front of the central scheme slightly to its right. Of the 
above two, the second is regarded as the more important, and is 
usually the most sumptuous structure in the entire scheme. Besides 
these two, another structure, designed in the shape of a ceremonial 
chariot, forms, not infrequently, an important annexe of the scheme 
as a whole. The tendency towards emphasizing the external and 
accessory features during the preceding period has already been 
noted. 209 In the Vijayanagara phase such a tendency is also empha¬ 
tically felt. 

A temple of the Vijayanagara style is certainly sumptuous, and 
the intricacy, beauty, and exuberant wealth of its rich decorative 
details appear to be rather bewildering. But a keen observer cannot 
fail to detect that howsoever elaborate and intricate the decorative 
treatment might be, there is always maintained a judicious balance 
between the structure and its ornament. A structural feature, not 
unoften, may lend itself to an absurd and fantastic form, but the de¬ 
sign of such a form is always determined by the shape and function 
of that feature. This is particularly noticeable in the varied and 
ingenious designs of the pillars. The pillars constitute a major 
architectural scheme in the temple complex as a whole. The most 
frequent design is one in which the shaft becomes either a central 
core or a background for a group of statuary, of substantial pro¬ 
portions and carved practically in the round. Such statuary attach¬ 
ed to the pillars takes the form of caryatids of such shapes as yalis 
or rampant hippogryphs with fighting riders and groups of soldiers; 
and in the treatment of such caryatids is often noticed the most 
ingenious and imaginative fantasy. Less complicated, but equally 
effective, is the pattern of the monolithic pillar consisting of a cen- 


729 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


tral column with slender columnettes attached all around. Still 
more simple is a pattern in which the shaft is divided into zones, 
each zone being occupied by a miniature motif of the shrine itself, 
and the whole showing a succession of such motifs one above the 
other. To this simpler variety belongs also the pattern in "which 
the shaft is divided into a number of cubical motifs separated by 
wide bands chamfered into eight or sixteen sides. Whatever the 
pattern, whether simple or the most complicated—the two often 
appearing alternately in the same composition—, the pillar, in spite 
of even the most ingenious treatment, does never lose its structural 
character and import. Similar is also the case with brackets, very 
often most elaborately treated, forming the capitals of the pillars. 
They are as ornate as the pillars themselves. The usual pattern is 
that of a pendant bracket elaborated into a volute which terminates 
in an inverted lotus bud. Continuous panels of sculptures, illus¬ 
trative of various myths and legends, appear on the exterior surfaces 
of the wails and lend a rich plastic effect to the entire composition. 
The wide roll cornice with double flexture serves also as an im¬ 
portant decorative motif, the undersides being invariably richly 
treated. 

The sumptuous character of the Vijayanagara style of temple 
will be clear and manifest from the above general description. 
Many notable temples were produced in different parts of the king¬ 
dom, but it will be possible to refer only to the finest and the most 
representative examples which are generally centered in the capital. 
From the foreign accounts Vijayanagara appears to have been as 
much a capital city as a city of temples, and a number of interest¬ 
ing temples may still be found extant in this deserted site. The 

temple of Pampapati 210 is the most sacred; but the finest in the 

* 

city are those of Vitthalasvaml 211 and Hazara Rama, 212 erected dur¬ 
ing the reign of Krishnadevaraya which represents the most flourish¬ 
ing epoch of the Vijayanagara kingdom. Exquisitely ornamented 
in the manner described above, these two have been classed by 
some scholars as among the most perfect specimens of the Vijaya¬ 
nagara style. Both are fundamentally identical in design and deco¬ 
rative treatment. The Hazara Rama temple is, however, a much 
smaller composition, and as such consists of a smaller number of 
attendant structures. In fact, the group consists simply of the main 
complex, i.e. the sanctum and its mandapa axially joined together, 
and the Amman shrine, the two being placed in a quadrangle en¬ 
closed by walls and entered through a gopuram in the east. In 
spite of its small size, its highly ornate character and its close proxi¬ 
mity to the royal enclosure seem to distinguish it as the private 
chapel of the Vijayanagara kings. The mandapa has three porticoes 


730 


ART 


projecting from its three sides. The roof is supported on a group 
of richly carved and highly polished squat stone pillars. The 
brackets, beams, as well as the undersides of the ceilings and the 
roll cornices are also elaborately ornamented. The sanctum, stand¬ 
ing at the back of the mandapa , is topped by a pyramidal tower of 
the usual Drdvida mode, built in brick and plaster. Indeed, during 
this period brick and stucco come to be increasingly used in the 
fashioning of such superstructures, the detailed ornament being 
usually done in the latter material. The friezes of sculptures on 
the exterior walls of the temple and its enclosure illustrate the story 
of the Rdmdyana. 

The VitthalasvamI temple is a larger and much more ambitious 
conception which, though begun as early as A.D. 1513, could not 
be completed, and the project had apparently to be abandoned after 
Talikota. The temple and its various appurtenances are situated 
within a rectangular court, 538 feet by 315 feet, i.e. nearly three 
times the size of the Hazara Rama, enclosed by pillared cloisters 
all around and entered through three gopurams, now grievously 
damaged, on its three sides. The eastern gopurctm formed the 
principal entrance to the temple enclosure. The main complex is 
a long rectangular structure, aligned from east to west and con¬ 
sisting of three sections. The entire scheme is raised over an exqui¬ 
sitely ornamented stylobate, and is terminated by deep roll cornices 
topped by parapets and small pyramidal rochets in brick and 
plaster. The mandapa is an open pillared pavilion with a project¬ 
ing portico on each side, and this frontal adjunct, with its ranges 
of richly carved pillars of varied designs, constitutes one of the 
chief attractions of this central group. Every feature in the interior, 
including the undersides of the beams, ceilings, cornices, etc., is 
elaborately ornamented, and if the roof of the mandapa and the 
tower over the sanctum had been completed, it would have ranked 
as one of the most successful productions of South Indian temple 
architecture. Various other appurtenances, such as the Amman 
shrine, the ornamental chariot of masonry, the Kalydna-mandapa 
and other pavilions, are disposed around this central scheme, each 
in its position specified by rituals. Among these, the Kalydna- 
mandapa y in its bold and elegant design and exuberant richness, 
seems to have excelled even the principal scheme. Fergusson is en¬ 
tirely justified when he says that the VitthalasvamI temple “shows 
the extreme limit in florid magnificence to which the style advanced/’ 

Temples of similar magnificence may also be seen in other parts 
of the Vijayanagara kingdom and Fergusson refers particularly to 
a deserted temple at Tadpatri, 213 about 100 miles to the south-east 


731 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 


of the capital city, built by a governor of Krishnadevaraya. As the 
treatment of the two gopurams of this temple indicates, this compo¬ 
sition surpassed perhaps even the VitthalasvamI temple. The per¬ 
pendicular, i.e. the lower, part of gopurams is usually comparatively 
plain, the figure sculptures being, as a rule, confined to the 
pyramidal, i.e. the upper, part. But in the two gopurams of the 
deserted temple at Tadpatri (one of them unfinished), the whole 
of the perpendicular part, to quote Fergusson, “is covered with the 
most elaborate sculpture, cut with exquisite sharpness and preci¬ 
sion,.and produces an effect richer, and on the whole perhaps 

in better taste, than anything else in this style.” It is temples like 
these, more than any other, that vividly recall the rich and lavish 
magnificence of the Vijayanagara style. 

The nucleus of a famous temple establishment in South India 
was usually a small village temple which gradually grew rich, and, 
with increasing wealth, was added to in successive ages. It is in 
this manner that the establishment took the shape of a vast com¬ 
plex of structures of many periods. Obviously no regular design 
or layout could be expected in the grouping of such fortuitous aggre¬ 
gates carried out in different ages, except that they were ranged 
in successive walled courts gradually extending outwards. It is in 
the outer courts and their various aggregates that one may find a 
lavish display of magnificence, and though ineffective as a whole, 
the sumptuous beauty of individual buildings seems to arrest the 
admiration of every spectator. 

The Vijayanagara sovereigns, in days of their greatness, were 
evidently responsible for large-scale additions to important religious 
establishments scattered throughout their dominions. To a certain 
extent such additions are recognizable by the presence of what 
has been described above as the distinctive characteristics of the 
Vijayanagara temple style. The place that the Kalydna-mandapa 
occupies in the temple scheme of this period has already been indi¬ 
cated. It is interesting to find that in not a few of the famous 
South Indian shrines, these large and spacious halls appear, from 
their style, to owe their origin to the patronage of the Vijayanagara 
rulers. These open halls have flat roofs supported on richly carved 
pillars, regularly spaced, their number in each case depending on 
the dimensions of the hall. Whatever the number, they are usu¬ 
ally known as thousand-pillared mandapas and constitute an impor¬ 
tant appanage of every religious establishment of some note. Like 
the pillars, the ceilings are also decorated with a variety of elegant 
motifs, all in good taste, while the wide cornice, with double flexure 
extending all around, lends a distinctive note to the building as 


732 



ART 


a whole. When integrated with the general scheme they add to the 
beauty and dignity of the entire complex. Unfortunately, such an 
integration is of a very rare occurrence. 

Among the mandapas that may be assigned to the Vijayanagara 
epoch, mention may be made of those in the Parvati temple at 
Chidambaram (South Arcot district), in the fort at Vellore (North 
Arcot district), in the temples of Varadarajasvami and Ekambara- 
natha at Kahchipuram (Chingleput district), in the Jambukesvara 
temple near Trichinopoly, and in the Margasakhesvara temple at 
Virinjipuram (North Arcot district). Of these, the mandapa in the 
Parvati temple at Chidambaram 214 appears to belong to an early 
phase in the epoch before the Vijayanagara temple style had reached 
its most affluent expression. It is a small porch hall of singular ap¬ 
pearance, forming the entrance to the shrine, and is situated in the 
centre of a court surrounded by double-storeyed galleries. The 
situation itself gives it an individual character. The interior ar¬ 
rangement of the hall in aisles of varying depths separated by rows 
of richly carved pillars is also singularly pleasing. The central aisle 
has pillars with engaged pilasters branching out at the top in a 
succession of elegant brackets to form a kind of vaulting for support 
of the roof. As a structural expedient the procedure is sound as 
well as effective, and the skilful but restrained manner of delicate 
carvings lends the hall a sober dignity which is hard to find in simi¬ 
lar erections elsewhere. 

The other mandapas, referred to above, are more substantial in 
design and, at the same time, more ornate in conception. The 
Kalydna-mandapa at Vellore 215 has been described by Percy Brown 
to be “the richest and most beautiful structure of its kind.” The 
carvings of its piers with attached pilasters, its bracket shafts, etc., 
are exuberant as well as intricate, but in a manner that is neither 
extravagant nor overburdening. In the treatment of the piers occurs 
a motif of great vigour and forcefulness that was to become charac¬ 
teristic of Dravida architecture of this and the later phases. This 
is the vydlis with rearing horsemen^ which adorn the piers in front, 
and whose beginnings may be traced to the archaic motif of the 
sedant or rampant animals appearing for the first time in the seventh 
century A.D. in the rock-cut architecture of the Pallavas at Maha- 
valipuram. After a lapse of several centuries the motif reappears, 
in an oriented and more sumptuous form, to suit the luxuriant style 
of this period. 

The Kalydna-mandapas in the temples of Varadarajasvami and 
Ekambaranatha at Kahchipuram 216 display similar exuberance in 
conception and treatment, but the tendency to overcrowding mars, 


733 


THE DELHI SULTANATE 

to a certain extent, the view of the interior as a whole. The 
mavdapa in the Jambukesvara temple 217 near Trichinopoly is, how¬ 
ever, a more elegant and graceful architectural design. Extending 
from gopuram to gopuram and with one side opening on a tank fed 
by a perpetual spring, it has its pillars more widely spaced and 
its aisles disposed in varying depths and heights. The effect of the 
interior is, as a result, much more sober and dignified, in spite of 
the sumptuous character of the pillars and brackets. The Virinji- 
pur am mandapa 218 is, likewise, an effective conception due to the 
judicious distribution of spaces in the interior which compensates, 
in a way, for the unrestrained exuberance in the treatment of the 
pillars and brackets. 

Tall and massive gopurams, forming entrances to the courts, 
lend a charming effect of picturesqueness to every notable temple 
complex of South India, and the Vijayanagara sovereigns were zeal¬ 
ous in raising up such colossal gateways, in order to display their 
power and pomp as much as their ardent devotion to religion. In 
the previous volume 219 it has been observed how, from a compara¬ 
tively small beginning, the gopuram tends to become higher and 
higher. In the Vijayanagara epoch this tendency reaches its supreme 
expression in a massive rectangular building that accommodates 
an enormous entrance doorway and is covered by a lofty pyramidal 
tower rising up in storeys and ultimately crowned by a barrel¬ 
shaped vault. It was the usual practice to build the perpendicular 
section, containing the doorway, in stone, and the pyramidal sec¬ 
tion, forming the storeyed tower, in brick and plaster. It is in the 
latter section that there may be noticed the most lavish display of 
ornament consisting of massive figure scriptures as well as of the 
most intricate devices and patterns. Such ornaments were usually 
done in stucco, a bold and precise execution being characteristic of 
this age. Many of the tall gopurams that distinguish the famous 
South Indian temple complexes seem to have been raised under the 
aegis of the Vijayanagara rulers, and among these the southern 
gopuram in the temple of Ekambaranatha at Kahchlpuram 220 is cer¬ 
tainly the most important. It w^as built by Krishnadevariaya, the 
most famous of the Vijayanagara sovereigns, and is a colossal struc¬ 
ture rising up in ten storeys to a height of 188 feet. In size alone 
it is one of the most conspicuous among all buildings of this kind 
in the whole of South India. It is at the same time a highly deco¬ 
rative one. An exuberance of sculptures and ornamentations breaks 
up this stupendous mass in a manner that imparts to it an effect of 
airy lightness, thereby enhancing the impression of soaring height. 
Every motif, whether figura! or decorative, is beautifully adjusted 
to the scale of the monument and of the section in which it is placed. 


734 


ART 


Therefore, in spite of exuberance^ there is no sense of extravagance, 
nor lack of clarify, everything being an integral part of the design 
as a whole. One of the most eminent productions of its kind, this 
gopuram seems to have provided the model for subsequent erections 
of this order. But despite their size and v/ealth of detail, none of 
these later structures can equal it in respect of its great beauty 
and the balance and rhythm of its design.

by Muhammad Kabir. MS. British Museum 
London, Add. 24409. 


A collection of 140 stories, mainly relating to 
Lodll and Sur kings and written probably to¬ 
wards the end of Akbar’s reign, as the name 
of Jahangir does not occur anywhere in the 
text. They depict traditions, myths, supersti¬ 
tions and often contain narratives of some 
historical events scribbed carelessly without 
much regard for truth or accuracy. Great care 
is, therefore, necessary in regard to uncorro¬ 
borated statements. 

Muhammad Kabir was a daughter’s son of 
Shaikh Khalil-ullah HaqqanI, an Afghan saint, 
who spent the major part of his life in Bengal 
and was reported to have met Akbar three 
times. As stated in the preface of the work, 
Muhammad Kabir collected the stories in 
order to get over the grief caused by his son’s 
premature death. The tragedy, however, deep¬ 
ly affected his mind and consequently his 
writing suffered from a disturbed balance.

It is a contemporary work on music and dancing 
compiled during Sikandar’s reign and based 
entirely on Indian sources, chiefly Sanskrit 
and Hindi, of which seven have been cited. The 
author appears to be a remarkable linguist, for, 
in addition to his scholarship in Persian prose 
and poetry, he had admirable command over 
the Indian languages. The text of the work, 
when completed, had the approval of Sikan¬ 
dar’s minister, Mian Bhuwa, who was well 
known for his patronage of learning and the 
learned. 

The work is the rarest of its kind and, being 
perhaps the oldest one in Persian on Indian 
music and dancing, provides a valuable ac¬ 
count of the social and cultural life of the 
period. It throws abundant light on the culti¬ 
vation of the fine arts and the interest taken in 
them by the Sultan and his nobles.

It is a biography of Sultan Mahmud Khalji of 
Malwa (1436-1469) with a brief account of his 
predecessors. The author, of whose antece¬ 
dents much is not known, was a court chroni¬ 
cler of the Khalji monarch and wrote the bio¬ 
graphy shortly after his patron’s death at the 
command of the latter’s successor, Sultan 
Ghiyas-ud-dln Khalji. Dealing primarily with 
the Sultans of Malwa, the work contains a 
valuable account, based on the author’s per¬ 
sonal knowledge, of some important episodes 
relating to the career of the first Lodi king 
regarding whom any other contemporary 
material hardly appears to exist. The cele¬

with the death of Timur while the second was

based on the valuable contemporary record of 
Hafiz Abru (see no. 34 a below) while for the

It is a comprehensive work on general history 
from the Ghaznavides up to A.D. 1593-4 and 
forms the basis of a number of later similar 
works. The author appears to have made use 
of the best extant sources and of the twenty- 
nine authorities quoted by him, some are en¬ 
tirely lost to us now. However, a comparison 
of the contents of the work with the account 
of other contemporaneous and earlier works 
on the period under review, shows that it is 
not so very reliable as is generally considered 
to be. Errors have been found in the record¬ 
ing of dates, names and some of the events 
particularly in the chapters dealing with the 
Sultanate, Jaunpur, Malwa, Multan and the 
Punjab. There are also contradictions in the 
statements regarding the same event or per¬ 
son recorded in the different volumes of the 
work. A typical instance may be quoted of 
Daulat Khan Lodi who, in T.A., I, 351, is 
stated to have personally gone to Kabul to 
meet Babur and having died on his way back 
to the Punjab. In Vol II (pp. 8-9) he is subse¬ 
quently presumed alive and a description is 
given of his capitulation to Babur at Milwat, 
after a period of active hostility. 

There are similar contradictions met with in the 
account of Jaunpur and Malwa given in Vols. 
I and III. Unfortunately, some of the later 
writers, who have drawn upon the T.A., have 
instead of correcting these errors, perpetuated 
them by copying them verbatim, as for in¬ 
stance, Nihawandi in the Ma’dsir-i-RaJvimi.

It is an exclusive Afghan work of Jahangir’s

careful examination of the work shows that it 
is almost entirely based on the Wdqi‘at-i- 
Mushtaqi (vide no. 47 below). Being full of 
anecdotes, it does not add much to the narra¬

but greatly helps in confirming them. Little is

English translation by B. Dorn entitled His¬ 
tory of the Afghans, London 1829-36. 

It is a systematic history of the Lodi and Sur 
Afghans compiled in 1021 A.H. (=A.D. 1613) 
by an experienced chronicler who, after losing 
his job at the Mughal Court, entered the service 
of the Afghan amir, Khan Jahan Lodi, the fa¬ 
vourite of the Emperor Jahangir. The work, 
which was undertaken at the behest of his new 
master, reveals an Afghan bias, and its pecu¬ 
liar feature is the sanctification of the origins 
of the Afghans by reviving the Israelite theory. 
The genealogical motive of the author in at¬ 
tempting a study of Afghan history is, there¬ 
fore, to be underlined. For his information re¬ 
garding the period of the Lodi’s and the Surs, 
he is mostly indebted to Mushtaqll, the T.A. 
and the Ma c dan-i-Akhabdr-i-Ahmadi.

by Yahya bin Ahmad as-Sirhindl. Persian text, 
Calcutta 1931. English translation by K. K. 
Basu, G.O.S., LXIII, 1932. 

It is a general history from the time of Sultan 
Mu‘izz-ud-dln Muhammad bin Sam up to the 
accession of the third Sayyid Sultan, Muham¬ 
mad Shah bin Farid (838 A.H.—A.D. 1434). 
The account of the concluding sixty years, of 
which the author had exceptional sources of 
knowledge, is the most original and valuable 
one. Yahya enjoyed the patronage of Sultan 
Mubarak Shah and dedicated the work to him. 
The narrative is, however, unbiased, straight-

It is a history of the Lodis and the Surs and the

quoted as one of the sources. Written in the 
usual pattern of anecdotal works it is much less 
reliable than the Tarikh-i-Daudi as the author 
has allowed many inaccuracies to creep into 
his account.

The author, being related to Sher Shah Sur, had 
special sources of information in respect of the 
history of the Afghans. Unfortunately, the first 
two parts of his work have been lost and the 
third part which is the only extant portion, 
deals with the life of Sher Shah. It contains, 
however, some useful information relating to 
the Lodi kings which help to confirm the ac¬ 
count of later writers. It was compiled c. A.D. 
1590.

Add. 11633. 

The two works, although similar in scope, are yet 
not entirely identical in their account. The 
date of composition, hitherto unrevealed in the 
various biographical notices of the author has 
been found by the writer in the body of the 
text (Wdqi-dt fol. 146 b ) as 980 A.H (=A.D. 
1572-73). The author died nine years later. 

These two MSS. constitute, perhaps, the earliest 
available account of the Afghan rulers of India. 
The author who was born in A.H. 897 (=A.D. 
1491) had lived during the late Lodi period. 
As for the earlier part of it, he had most re¬ 
liable sources of information. His father, 
Shaikh Sa‘dullah was a saintly scholar and had 
been closely associated with Sikandar’s noble, 
Mian Zain-ud-din. His grandfather Shaikh 
Firuz was a warrior-poet, and had written a 
versified account of the wars between Buhlul 
and Husain SharqS. (The poem is now lost 
and only two couplets have been quoted by 
Nur-ul-Haqq in the Zubdat-ut-Twarlkh, vide 
Cambridge MS. fol. 58 a ). Both Mushtaql and

his father were the disciples of the Saint, 
Shaikh Malladah, whom Sikandar held in great 
esteem. Besides, MushtaqI had been personally 
connected with some of the Amirs of Sikandar 
and Ibrahim. His knowledge of Hindi, of which 
he was a well-known scholar and poet, was of 
great advantage to him in gaining access to 
the material in that language. (His pen-name 
in Hindi was Niranjan, and two Hindi works, 
entitled Patman and Jot Niranjan, are attri¬ 
buted to him. See Akhbdr-ul-Akhydr p. 170, 
Hodivala p. 481). 

MushtaqI did not write to please a patron and 
his account was uninfluenced by any world¬ 
ly motive. He was a detached and religious- 
minded person, and his account of contem¬ 
porary events is the chief source on which later 
writers, such as Nizam-ud-dln, Ni‘matullah, 
Abdullah and Ahmad Yadgar, have extensively 
drawn. Although his style is not that of a re¬ 
gular historical work, yet he provides the most 
useful information about all the three Lodi 
monarchs. The narrative of events is frequent¬ 
ly interrupted by long digressions and anec¬ 
dotes, which, however, shed abundant light on 
the general life and the customs of the people. 
Many of the stories illustrate the effectiveness 
of Sikandar’s judicial and administrative sys¬ 
tem and have been copied by later writers.

THE VEDIC AGE 


“.... This history unlike its predecessors is first and foremost a 
history of India and of her people rather than a history of those who have 
from time to time invaded her.... The standard, in a word, is very high-” 

The Tinges Literary Supplement , London 

v 

“.... Distinguished historians contribute and they are not only learned 
but also very readable_It contains much new information-”

THE AGE OF IMPERIAL UNITY 

“... .It is safe to say that these volumes will transform the study of 
Indian history in our times; their authors are not only writing history; they 
themselves are making history, a whole new history of knowledge and 
education....”

“....The present volume covering the period 600 B.C. to A.D. 320 
is a worthy successor in its solid merits....” 

THE CLASSICAL AGE 

“....It maintains the leading trait of the series viz. to devote more 
attention to the social and cultural aspects of the story than to the purely 
political side, and the narrative of dynastic struggles and wars.... The 
political history is generally complete and up-to-date and a great amount 
of authentic information on social and economic history has been culled 
and presented systematically for the first time....” 

K. A. Nilakanta Sastri in Journal of Indian History 

THE AGE OF IMPERIAL KANAUJ 

“....This is a magnificent piece of exact and unbiassed scholarship 
.... Its pages are alive with the spirit of the modem Indian Renaissance; 
freedom has animated Indian learning and this is one of its finest achieve¬ 
ments. .. .this new Indian history is not concerned merely, or even mainly, 
with war and politics. Two-thirds of the book deal with cultural and social 
matters....” 

The Statesman 

THE STRUGGLE FOR EMPIRE 

“....Like all the preceding volumes its treatment_is detailed and 

comprehensive and is based upon the highest standards of scholarship. The 
contributors.... have made the best use of all the available source material 
and the important previous works on the subject.... From every point of 
view it will be accepted as the standard and authoritative work on the history 
of India in the age of transition from ancient to medieval times....”
