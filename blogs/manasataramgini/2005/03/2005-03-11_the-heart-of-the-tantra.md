title = "The heart of the tantra"

+++
The very word tantra conveys that deep meaning to the “knowers”. That
secret power that resides in the ‘hR^idaya‘ of bhairava and is known as
kaulinI. The anuttara of its own confers kaulika perfection. The tantra
is like a science because it is reproducible in its real form. The
sAdhaka on the true path first gets a glimpse of “kaulika existence”
when he can grasp the the samvAda of manthAna bhairava and tripura
bhairavI. If he can go beyond, the bIja mantra activates the apparatus
of the chakras and the ever-sleeping kubjikA awakens and courses on the
“path”. The sAdhaka then experiences the awe as he realizes the
enfolded state of the vishva in the ‘hR^idaya‘. If the sAdhAka can go
beyond, then he is stationed at the the “mid-point”. There he sees the
oscillation of visarga moving in the two directions at once. When he
reaches there he has reproduced in totality the words of manthAna
bhairava. He reproduces the experience of the guru, he reproduces the
experience of the true tantrics of yore. This act of reproducing the
experience gives the sadhAka the experience of ecstasy. This is like the
feeling of doing real science the reproducibility of the observation/
the experiment.
