## CHRIST'S MESSAGE TO THE WORLD

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 5, p. 379.)

*\[From Mr. Frank Rhodehamel's notes of a lecture delivered in San
Francisco, California, on March 11, 1900\]*

Everything progresses in waves. The march of civilization, the
progression of worlds, is in waves. All human activities likewise
progress in waves — art, literature, science, religion.

Great waves succeed each other, and between these great waves is a
quiet, a calm, a period of rest, a period of recuperation.

All manifest life seems to require a period of sleep, of calm, in which
to gain added strength, renewed vigour, for the next manifestation, or
awakening to activity. Thus is the march of all progress, of all
manifest life — in waves, successive waves, \[of\] activity and repose.
Waves succeed each other in an endless chain of progression.

Religion, like everything else, progresses in waves; and at the summit
of each great wave stands an illumined soul, a mighty spiritual leader
and teacher of men. Such a one was Jesus of Nazareth.
