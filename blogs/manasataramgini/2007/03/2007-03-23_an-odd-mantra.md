title = "An odd mantra"

R mentioned to me a while back a mantra of great significance to
sarasvatI that her ancestors had acquired from Shymol Ram:  
OM dhIH shruti-vij\~nA || (1)  
Neither R nor me have not been able to locate it any tantra available to
us. However it appears as a mantra to praj\~nApAramitA in \#658 of the
highly corrupt Bali stuti saMhitA. As the Balinese were isolated from
India in the Islamic period their Sanskrit education declined greatly
and when they recorded these mantras and stuti-s they were horribly
corrupt. In a very general sense the mistakes they make reminds one of
the hilariously atrocious mistakes made by the drAviDas in transmitting
Sanskrit via the degraded medium of Tamil. It would be interesting to
see if the source tantra of the mantra can be traced from the Indonesian
texts.  
With some searching we found a cunning variant of it bauddha tantric
digest, the sAdhanA-mAlA:  
OM dhIH shruti-smR^iti-vijaye svAhA || (2)  
The nAstika in his typical way wants to present his deity as being the
victor over the shruti and smR^iti of the Aryaâ€“ thus the pAShaNDa subtly
alters the word vij\~nA to vijayA to generate this variant mantra. This
shows that the original did actually go from the Hindus to the bauddha-s
and at least initially was preserved in the proper form (1).
