title = "A zarathuShtrian exit at a Hindu funeral"

+++
This note continues with the examples we have been providing on these
pages illustrating the role of the kavi as a naturalist or an observer
of nature. The verse below is a macabre one composed by one of  the
greatest men among our people, pANini. It might not be an exaggeration
to say that we owe the language that was the purveyor Hindu culture and
the lingua franca of the Indosphere to him. This verse, like several
others that are in circulation, might have come from his lost novel. It
describes a scene at the cemetery where a corpse undergoing cremation is
appropriated by vultures. zarathuShtra, the reformulator of the old
Iranian religion (which was originally close to the Indo-Aryan version),
rebelled against the old Indo-European funeral custom of cremation and
went for a less-widely used practice of disposal of the corpse by
vultures – evidently because he felt Atar, the cognate of the holy agni
would be defiled by a corpse (especially given the extreme Iranian
necrophobia). Indeed, ironically here pAnini calls the fire hutabhuj or
the eater of oblations of the gods, the very fire which zarathuShtra
feared to “contaminate”. But in this scene described by pANini the wake
of vultures boldly venture to take over the burning corpse from a pyre
and compete to feed on it. Given our limitations it took us sometime to
work out some aspects of the great man’s word-craft. In particular the
word dhAmnaH puzzled us before we arrived at the solution presented
below.

With flapping wings striking the fire to weaken its violent radiance,  
from the middle of the pyre they have dragged out a corpse,  
each one contending with another with pecks of their fierce beaks,  
having abundantly feasted on the freshly roasted flesh of the corpse,  
which’s as if glowing and half in flames; See\! with scorching
innards,  
to the lake the kettle of vultures speedily resorts\!
