## LXIV

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

THOUSAND ISLAND PARK  
C/O MISS DUTCHER  
N. Y.

*27th July '95*

DEAR MOTHER —

 

I will be ever so much obliged if you kindly look into the "bead"
affair. (Rudrâksha beads sent from India. *Vide* letter dated January
17, 1895 in *[Complete
Works](../../volume_6/epistles_second_series/058_sarada.htm)* , VI.) I
think there will be a little duty to pay. I will pay it to you when I
come.

I start from here next week. I will be in Detroit a day or two on my
way. I will be in by the third or fourth of August.

With Everlasting love, your Son,  
VIVEKANANDA

*\[Enclosed in the above letter was the following note.\]*

*27th July '95*  
TO THE UNITED STATES EXPRESS COMPANY

FOREIGN DEPARTMENT.

DEAR SIR,

Herewith I authorize Mrs. George W. Hale to take delivery of the "beads"
that have been expressed to me from India. Hoping they will be regularly
delivered to her, I remain yours obediently,

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA
