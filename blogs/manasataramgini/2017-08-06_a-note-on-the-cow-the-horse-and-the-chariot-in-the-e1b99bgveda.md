yasmai tvaṃ sukṛte jātaveda

For whom you will make a pleasant world, O Jātavedas\!  
as he does correct rituals for you, O Agni\!  
He endowed with horses, offspring, heroes,  
cattle and wealth attains well-being.

It would be an understatement to say in the Ṛgveda the cow, the horse
and the chariot mattered a lot to the Ārya-s. Indeed, philogical
evidence establishes beyond doubt that they were central to the life of
the Indo-Iranians. Their [mentions number in the several
hundreds](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/16/the-ramaya%e1%b9%87a-and-a-para-ramaya%e1%b9%87a-in-numbers-ii-evolving-early-indo-aryan-warfare/)
whereas houses and gold (hiraṇya) is mentioned far fewer times (171
times). If you sample random blocks of variable size measured in terms
of half ṛk-s (50 : 5000) from the Ṛgveda and count the number of
occurrences of the common words for cow(go), horse (aśva) and chariot
(ratha) per block you find that the number of occurrences of any pair of
them are strongly correlated (Pearson’s correlation \>.9 for each pair).
This suggests that they form a complex that is present throughout the
RV. Yet this poses a poorly acknowledged but major paradox for the
archaeology, dating and the geography of the text:  
1\) The RV is considered by white indologists and their fellow travelers
to have been composed in Gandhāra and Pāñcanada at its oldest
\~3500-3200 years before present. The chariots are said to appear in the
archaeological record earliest \~4100 YBP in the Sintashta culture on
the Bronze age steppes. Thus the two are said to be comfortably
consistent, with the RV being composed after the ārya-s had settled in
northern India in the late/post-Harappan landscape. The Andronovo
culture, which succeeds the Sinthasta, is seen as the intermediary which
expanded and transmitted the steppe Indo-Iranian culture to India. This
is seen as being consistent with the absence of horses and chariots in
the Harappan culture (though in reality horses are recorded in some
Harappan sites though rare in both remains and depictions).

2\) In contrast the RV shows clear knowledge of specific geothermal
phenomena in the Caspian region. Further, its astronomical references
compared with those of the Yajurveda and the Vedāñga Jyotiṣa point to
dates certainly certainly earlier to \~3500-3200 YBP and even before the
earliest Sintashta chariots, perhaps closer to 5000 YBP than 4000 YBP.
These dates, while well-known to Hindu scholars since Tilak, are
routinely ignored by white indologists as fantasies of the Hindus
despite early acknowledgment of the same in their midst by Jacobi.
Further, the study of the ethnogenesis of the Indians suggests that the
main Indo-Aryan contribution came from the invasion of some population
related to the Yamnaya of the early steppe Bronze age. This population
developed and expanded subsequently as the Sinthasta or its successor
Andronovo culture which show evidence for the expansion of the “Indian”
branch of the R1a1 Y-haplogroup, which is associated with the invasion
of India by the ārya-s. Further, there is the confusing evidence of
[Sarasvati
river](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/sarasvati-the-devi-and-the-sarasvati-the-nadi/)
also pointing to an earlier date for the RV, albeit with much lesser
certainty for it would dictate an Indian locus.

We do find the early dates for the RV based on astronomical allusions to
be convincing. Further, as discussed earlier it does match with other
features like: 1) near lack of rice agriculture and dominance of barley;
2) the rarity of the sword and the gadā (which can be associated with
BMAC) as war weapons; 3) hardly any mention of the complex society with
multiple service castes found in the Yajurveda brāhmaṇa-s and ritual.
Thus, to us the RV in most part bears all the signs of an early text
that is actually not consistent with what we know from archaeology of
the period around 3500-3200 YBP in northern India. Hence, we accept the
presence of a real paradox that needs wider recognition and study to be
resolved suitably.

Irrespective, of how exactly the scenario resolves we can paint some
aspect of the lives of the ārya-s based on the RV: They were different
from the later horse-centric pastoralists like the steppe Iranians (e.g.
śaka-s) and Altaic peoples for whom the horse was primary and the cow
marginal. In contrast, for the ārya-s the cow was central to their
nutrition and economy and the horse played a central military role.
While the ārya-s certainly rode horses, its military role in that period
was apparently not so much as direct mount as much as for drawing the
war-chariot. Accordingly, the chariot was an important symbol of power.
This, expressed itself in the form of the chariot/horse races which were
an important form of contest, entertainment and ritual. Further, unlike
the later horse-centric steppe pastoralists the ārya-s did practice some
agriculture even before they arrived in the Indian subcontinent and
seemed to have focused on barley cultivation. Here, again cattle were
clearly central; they drew the plow, concomitant with which seeding of
the furrows took place. Thus, the economy of the ārya-s was necessarily
a mixed one combining both cattle-rearing and agriculture. Other than
horse with its special military role, goats and sheep were also reared
with the latter supplying wool which is mentioned in the RV. However,
notably there is no mention whatsoever of cotton. Camels are mentioned 5
times (4 times in maṇḍala 8) – thus, they were known but do not appear
to have been very important, unlike in the case of the Avestan Iranians.
This suggests that though the two cultures were related there was a
geographic/temporal separation between the Avestan Iranians and RV
ārya-s, with the former being obviously younger due the daiva-ahura
polarization.

1. (mean: red, median: blue).

That said let us take a closer look at cows, horses and chariots in the
RV. In the first experiment we draw 10,000 blocks of 350 half-ṛk-s each
at random from the RV and count the number of times the words aśva
(excluding the name of the gods Aśvin-s), ratha and go. A histogram of
their occurrences (Figure 1) shows that while the cow is quite normally
distributed there is some skew for the chariot and even greater skew for
the horse (In a typical run we get skewness(ratha)=0.325;
skewness(aśva)=0.472; skewness(go)=0.277). This suggests certain
regions with higher than typical mention of these.

To understand the origin of this skewness better we next look at the
occurrence of these words per maṇḍala normalized by the number of
half-ṛk-s per maṇḍala (Figure 2).

[![ratha\_ashva\_go\_maNDala](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ratha_ashva_go_mandala.png?w=626&h=835)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ratha_ashva_go_mandala.png)Figure
2. (mean: blue horizontal line)

We notice that the maṇḍala-4 of Vāmadeva Gautama has an above average
density of references to the word go. We wonder if this is actually a
purposeful encoding of their clan name Gotama (literally meaning he with
the best cattle) by the main author of the maṇḍala. Of course the
self-reference Gotama occurs here but also the phrase gomad (with
cattle) is frequently used. This could be a parokṣa signature of the
Gotama-s. Then we observe that in maṇḍala-9, the Soma maṇḍala there is
the highest per maṇḍala density of this word for cow. This is because of
the frequent metonymic usage of cow for milk which is mixed with the
soma (*Ephedra* species) juice in the preparation of the ritual beverage
(also probably the placing of the soma stalks on cattle hide). Notably,
aśva and ratha are both clearly over-represented together in maṇḍala-5
of the Atri-s.

To understand this better we take a closer look at the mention of these
words across the RV by calculating counts in continuously sliding
windows of 100 half-ṛk-s from the beginning to the end of the text
Figure 3).

[![ratha\_ashva\_go\_window](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ratha_ashva_go_window.png?w=636&h=848)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ratha_ashva_go_window.png)Figure
3. (mean across all window is green line)

We notice that whereas go shows a fairly continuous distribution of
fluctuations, ratha less so, and aśva shows few clear standout peaks.
The largest of these is seen in maṇḍala-1 which corresponds to the
famous aśvastuti of Dirghatamas Aucathya which is deployed in the grand
Aśvamedha ritual. Notably, there are two standout peaks for aśva in
maṇḍala-5 of the Atri-s and maṇḍala-7 of Vasiṣṭha-s which are
correlated with corresponding peaks of ratha. In the case of the Atri-s
a part of this again relates to a dhānastuti where an
aśvamedha-performing Bhārata monarch is praised. But even beyond this
the Atri-s and Vasiṣṭha-s to a lesser degree seem to have a special
tendency to mention horses and chariots more than on an average in
certain contexts. This does not seem to have geographic factor because
the [Atri-s show links to Kāṇva-s of
maṇḍala-8](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/10/27/the-mandala-graph-for-rishi-sharing/)
who show no such special proclivity. Rather, it does raise the
possibility that the Atri-s were either special connoisseurs or breeders
of horses.

Thus the great Śyāvāśva the Ātreya praises the Marut-s:

gomad aśvāvad rathavat suvīraṃ  
candravad rādho maruto dadā naḥ ।  
praśastiṃ naḥ kṛṇuta rudriyāso  
bhakṣīya vo ‘vaso daivyasya ॥ RV 5.57.7

Endowed with cows, with horses, with chariots, with good heroes  
with gold, wealth you have given us, O Maruts\!  
Make praise be ours O sons of Rudra\!  
May I partake a share of your divine aid.
