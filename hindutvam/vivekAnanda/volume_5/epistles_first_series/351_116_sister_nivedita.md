## CXVI

BENARES (VARANASI),  
*12th February, 1902*.

May all powers come unto you! (Sister Nivedita) May Mother Herself be
your hands and mind! It is immense power — irresistible — that I pray
for you, and, if possible, along with it infinite peace. . . .

If there was any truth in Shri Ramakrishna, may He take you into His
leading, even as He did me, nay, a thousand times more!

VIVEKANANDA.
