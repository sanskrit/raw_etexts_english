title = "Another mAraNa strike"

+++
The amAtya had warned us that we would face a mAraNa strike anytime.
Sensing trouble we deployed the arrows of sharva around us. The archers
surrounded us completely to shield us from the kR^ityA which was to
strike. We were coursing in the grip of the kR^ityA, without much
apparent effect. But suddenly the ratha in which we travelled was
smashed completely. We were glad that the archers had kept us alive and
we escaped with life, though our ratha was completely smashed.
