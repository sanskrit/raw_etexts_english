MATH, BELUR,  
*26th December, 1900*.

DEAR SHASHI, (Swami Ramakrishnananda)

I got all the news from your letter. If your health is bad, then
certainly you should not come here; and also I am going to Mayavati
tomorrow. It is absolutely necessary that I should go there once.

If Alasinga comes here, he will have to await my return. I do not know
what those here are deciding about Kanai. I shall return shortly from
Almora, and then I may be able to visit Madras. From Vaniyambadi I have
received a letter. Write to the people there conveying my love and
blessings, and tell them that on my way to Madras I shall surely visit
them. Give my love to all. Don't work too hard. All is well here.

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
