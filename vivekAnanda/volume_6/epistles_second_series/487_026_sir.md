## XXVI [1](#fn1)

(*Translated from [Bengali](b6038e6026.pdf)* )

*Victory to God!*

GHAZIPUR,  
*8th March, 1890*.

DEAR SIR,

Your note duly reached me, and so I too shall be off to Prayag. Please
write to inform where you mean to put up while there. 

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. In case Abhedananda reaches your place in a day or two, I shall be
much obliged if you will start him on his way to Calcutta.

VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#txt1)Letters i - iv, vi - xiv, xvi - xxii, xxiv - xxvi, xxix,
    xxxi - xxxiii and cxxiv are translated from Bengali letters written
    to Pramadadas Mitra of Varanasi, an orthodox Hindu, for whose
    profound erudition and piety Swamiji had the highest regard. These
    letters are most interesting being written (except the last) at a
    time when, after his Master's passing away, Swamiji was leading a
    wandering monk's life. In the early days he used to sign his name as
    Narendranath, though his now famous name, Vivekananda, is printed in
    all these pages for easy comprehension.
