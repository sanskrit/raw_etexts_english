title = "The sound and wave theories of thexa0Hindus"

+++
The achievements early Hindu science are hardly known in an objective
form. They are either being neglected due to the efforts of the leftist
Anti-Hindu academics from the West and India or exaggerated by
uneducated Hindus. One of the great Hindu theories of which we get some
limited glimpses are the ideas on sound propagation which are discussed
at length in the mImAsa text of shabara svAmin. In short they include
the following idea for the transmission of sound:  
1\) nAda or sound is a property of vAyu. 2) The sound movements are
constituted by a series of air movements of the nature of a current
termed vAyusantAna. 3) The sound causes the vAyu paramANus to
successively undergo saMyoga vibhAga that s conjunctions and
disjunctions resulting in spreading of the original impact as sound.

The vaisheShika scholars like prashastpAda and the later shrIdhara
introduced the concept of the sound wave. He explicity compares sound to
the waves in water. They posited that at anytime sound forms a circle
and spreads as circles or spherical shells from the source: yathA
