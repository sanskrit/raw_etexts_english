## CXV

*To Sister Christine*

KHETRI,

*13th December 1897*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

How funny all these dreams and evil prognostications of yours! You don't
want to send me evil influences by thinking that way of me! I will be
only too glad to lose 50 lbs. of my weight. A little rest puffs me up,
and I am the same bloated monk as ever.

I am all right except \[for\] a bad cold the last few days, owing to
exposure and travel in the desert. I thank you for the letter though. I
am pleased with it enormously, as it shows the mind.

Give Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\], Baby \[Stella Campbell\], and all the rest
my love, and, as you know, yourself —

Yours ever in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS — I will write a better note when this cold has left.

V.
