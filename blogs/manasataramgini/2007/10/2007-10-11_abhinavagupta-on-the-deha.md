title = "abhinavagupta on the deha"

+++
I was reminded of a statement of abhinavagupta in the tantrAloka due to
an exchange with a compatriot on the reason why matysendra is such a
colossus in ancient thought.

he says:  
evaM vishvAdhva saMpUrNaM kAla-vyApAra-chitritam |  
desha-kAla-maya-spanda-sadma dehaM vilokayet |  
tathA vilokyamAno .asau vishvAntardevatA-mayaH |  
dhyeyaH pUjyashcha tarpyashcha tadAviShTo vimuchyate | (tantrAloka
12.6-7)

Thus, the body is perceived as full of diverse pathways, marked by
time-dependent processes (lit. temporal processes), and as the seat of
vibrations in space and time. The \[body\] perceived thus is composed of
all devatA-s and meditated, worshiped and pacified \[quenched with
tarpaNaM-s\]. He who enters that \[the body\] is liberated.

This characteristically enlightened expression of abhinava to me
represents an expression of the thought-stream of mIna. But was it
entirely new ? Not really. Like many other things it goes back to vedic
thought. For example the upaniShad’s statement on indra-yoni in the
pineal is an early version of the same.
