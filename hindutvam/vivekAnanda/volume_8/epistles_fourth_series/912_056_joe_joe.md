## LVI

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

80 OAKLEY STREET,  
CHELSEA,  
*31st October, 1895*.

DEAR JOE JOE,

I shall be only too glad to come to lunch on Friday and see Mr. Coit at
the Albemarle.

Two American ladies, mother and daughter, living in London came in to
the class last night — Mrs. and Miss Netter. They were very sympathetic
of course. The class there at Mr. Chamier's is finished. I shall begin
at my lodgings from Saturday night next. I expect to have a pretty
good-sized room or two for my classes. I have been also invited to
Moncure Conways's Ethical Society where I speak on the 10th. I shall
have a lecture in the Balboa Society next Tuesday. The Lord will help. I
am not sure whether I can go up with you on Saturday. You will have
great fun in the country anyway, and Mr. and Mrs. Sturdy are such nice
people. 

With love and blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Kindly order some vegetables for me. I don't care much for rice —
bread will do as well. I have become an awful vegetarian now.

V.
