The Prestosuchids appear to be a sister group to the proper
rauisuchians, branching off after the ornithosuchians. They were top
carnivores in the Gondwana regions. But the phylogenetic relationships
of the suchian archosaurs remain far less understood than the
ornithodiran clade. Prestosuchus from south America has a skull (above)
that is a meter long and might have been upto 5 meters in length preying
vigorously on Triassic synapsids, dinosaurs and other reptiles.
