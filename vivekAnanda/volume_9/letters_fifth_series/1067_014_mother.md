## XIV

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

DETROIT

*Tuesday, 27 March 1894*

DEAR MOTHER,

Herewith I send two cheques of $114 and $75 to be put in the banks for
me. I have endorsed them to your care.

I am going to Boston in a day or two. I have got $57 with me. They will
go a long way. Something will turn up, as it always does. I do not know
where I go from Boston. I have written to Mrs. \[Francis W.\] Breed but
as yet heard nothing from her.[1](#fn1) His will be done. Not I but Thou
— that is always the motto of my life.

With my eternal gratitude, love, and admiration for Mother Church and
all the dignitaries,

I remain your son,  
VIVEKANANDA.

    Breed inviting him to Lynn to be her guest for a week; he accepted
    and spent a week at her home in Mid-April.
