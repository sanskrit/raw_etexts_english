title = "Further considerations on the pAshupata system"

+++
Though it is at the foundation of all the shaiva systems that survive to
date, the old pAshupata darshana has all but become extinct. Of the
pAshupata sUtra-s we have only 3 reported extant manuscripts thus far:
two from vArANasi and one from the va\~Nga country. Two of these
manuscripts are fragmentary and the third though complete is poorly
preserved. There appears to be another possible fragmentary manuscript
from the tamil country that has not been studied at all (I have only
seen the title and not examined it closely). Using two of the
manuscripts our coethnic R. Ananthakrishna Shastri produced the first
edition of the pAshupata sUtra-s in the first half of the 1900s. A few
years ago, the white indologist Bisschop produced several useful
corrections based on the 2nd vArANasi manuscript and other comparisons.
These sUtra-s are the only testimony we have of the pAshupata system
that bridges the gap between the earlier layers \[footnote 1\] and the
rise of the lAkulIsha pAshupata system and its later kAlAmukha
successor. The sUtra-s as we have them come with the bhAShya of a
certain kauNDinya, who tradition records to be a successor of lakulIsha.
This bhAShya also quotes a version of the sUtra-s that shows differences
from the version transmitted as a mUla-sUtrapATha. This shows that the
pATha used by kauNDinya was transmitted independently, but accompanied
by the mUla-sUtrapATha, without any “gene conversion-like event” to
equalize the two readings. Further, given the way the sUtra-s are
organized to go along with the bhAShya, it is possible that some of the
sUtra-s as we have them are only fragments of more complete sUtra-s that
were extracted from an earlier version of the kauNDinya bhAShya or some
other pre-kauNDinya bhAShya \[It is possible that the more complete
sUtra-s resembled the sUtra-like prescriptions of the pAshupata vrata in
the AV parishiShTha 40\]. This is suggested by the form of certain
sUtra-s, where they were clearly parts of longer coherent sUtra-s broken
for commentarial purposes:  
*mUtra-purIShaM nAvekshet |  
strI-shUdraM nAbhibhAShet |  
yady avekShed yady abhibhAshet |  
upaspR^ishva |  
prANAyAmaM kR^itvA |  
raudrIM gAyatrIM bahurUpIM vA japet |**  
* Here the pAshupata ascetic is prescribed not to see urine or feces and
not to converse with women and shUdra-s. If he does see the former two
or talk or touch the latter two he performs prANAyAma and does japa of
the rudra gAyatrI or the bahurUpI (i.e. aghora) mantra. We notice that
in baudhAyana dharma there is a single sUtra: *strI-shUdrair
nAbhibhASheta mUtra-purIShe nAvekSheta*. Similarly, the remaining
sUtra-s cited above might also be combined into a single one. Thus,
transmission of the sUtra-s as we have them today does seem to be
affected by the tradition of commentary and are probably not the
original form of them.

Despite these issues we can clearly see that the sUtra-s are of an
archaic character and resemble in large part the kalpa sUtra-s with some
features of the darshana sUtra-s. Yet unlike the kalpa or darshana
sUtra-s they do not bear the name of any author. Though certain
traditions mention lakulIsha as an author, there is absolutely nothing
what so ever to support this in the form of internal evidence from the
sUtra-s. Even kauNDinya’s commentary merely states the following:  
* tathA shiShTa prAmANyAt kAmitvAd ajAtatvAch cha manuShya-rUpI bhagavAn
brAhmaNa-kAyam AsthAya kAyAvata-raNe avatIrNa iti | tathA padbhyAm
ujjayinIM prAptaH |*  
i.e. shiva incarnated in the form of a man by entering the body of a
brAhmaNa in the forest of kAyAvata. Then he walked to Ujjain. This
account matches those narrated in the puraNa-s and the kArvaNa mAhAtmya
where lakulIsha incarnates in kAyAvarohaNa (modern Karvan village some
distance north of Baroda). However, unlike the latter accounts the name
lakulIsha is never mentioned even though in the subsequent lines
kauNDinya mentions that shiva as the brAhmaNa imparted the shAstra to
the student kushika. Only in the ratnaTIkA on the gaNakArikA (probably
authored by bhAsarvaj\~na) do we clearly see a mention of lakulIsha as
the founder of the pAshupata system. This raises questions regarding
lakulIsha being the actual composer of the sUtra-s.

Using the pAshupata sUtra-s one can look for key features of the
pAshupata ritual described in it in the earlier texts to trace the early
evolution of the shaiva system.  
**1) yoga and sAMkhya**: As we have discussed before on these pages the
practice of yoga goes back to the earliest shaiva layer in the form of
the shvetAshvatara and even there is accompanied by the philosophical
framework provided by sAMkhya. This connection to yoga continues through
the atharvashiras and the epic period (MBH13.14 shiva is identified with
the puruSha of sAMkhya). yoga remained a persistent and central theme of
shaiva practice which eventually gave rise to the yoga of the mantra
mArga. Beginning around the time of the pAshupata sUtra-s, elements of
vaisheShika are adopted by the system. Eventually nyAya-vaisheShika
comes to dominate the atimArga shaiva thought while sAMkhya remains at
the foundation of most mantra-mArga shaiva philosophy.

**2) The rite of bhasma snAna:** The pAshupata sUtra prescribes the
practitioner to smear himself with ashes. This rite is also found in the
atharvashiras and the AV-pari 40 suggesting that it was an old ritual of
the shaiva system which probably evolved from the vedic ritual of
smearing with ashes of a homa seen in the gR^ihya daily offering. It is
not specifically mentioned in the shvetAshvatara. It persisted amongst
all later shaiva branches.

**3) Iconic and temple worship of shiva**: These are clearly present in
the pAshupata-sUtra-s. We see a similar mention of iconic shiva worship
and temples in the pAshupata vratra of the AV-pari 40. In both these
texts we note that: a) the pAshupata wears rudra nirmAlya; b) he dances,
sings, plays musical instruments and laughs loudly; c) he is asked to
hangout at rudra shrines. However, the fire worship is a major component
in the rite of the AV-pari 40, and one of the places the pAshupata might
hang out is a fire house (agnyAgara). In the account of the pAshupata
Ashrama in the Mbh13.14 (vulgate) we encounter the presence of large
fire altars with kusha grass strew around them (*vishAlaish
chAgni-sharaNair-bhUShitaM kusha saMvR^itam*) and the mention of divine
women singing songs. In the same section rudra himself is described as
dancing, singing and playing instruments. There is no sign of iconic
worship in the atharvashiras or the SU. The early iconic worship as
suggested by the AV-pari 40 appears to have mirrored those found in the
late gR^ihya texts like those of vaikhAnasa and baudhAyana. Throughout
later Hindu history shiva temples of pAshupata-s were prominent
monuments on the landscape of bhAratavarSha and even left their
impression on the visiting nAstika chInAcharya-s. Interestingly, the
survival of classical music and dance in dakShiNapatha might have hugely
benefited from the patronage they received from the kAlAmukha successors
of the pAshupata-s.

**4) Male brAhmaNa-s only:** The original pAshupata vrata appears to
have been a solely male brAhmaNa affair. This is attested in both the
PaS and the AV-pari 40. The SU and AS also appear to be brAhmaNa
productions indicating that it arose specifically amongst brAhmaNa vedic
ritualists (not even other dvija-s). Only in the post-lakulIsha phase of
its development it opened up to include the 3 other varNa-s. By the
kAlAmukha phase we notice the involvement of women as patrons and
dancers in the temples.

**5) Wearing of li\~Nga:** We note this first in the PaS 1.6
\[*li\~NgadhArI\]*. We see no mention of this in the AV-pari 40 or the
earlier upaniShad texts. The earliest allusions to the li\~Nga as an
emblem of rudra appear in the great epic (anushAsana parvan). It is
hence conceivable that the PaS belongs to this period when li\~Nga
worship had come to the fore amongst the shaiva-s.

**6) Observance of govrata/pashuvrata:** This is mentioned in PaS 5.9
\[*godharmA mR^igadharmA vA*\]. It finds a mention in the epic
anushAsana parvan version of the pAshupata practice (Mbh 13.14 vulgate)
where it is described that some pAshupata-s observe the govrata and
others the mR^igavrata just as in the PaS. However, these vrata-s are
not described in the AV-pari 40 or the earlier upaniShad-s.

**7)pa\~nchabrahma:** A key feature of the pAshupata sUtra-s is their
link to the pa\~ncha brahma-mantra-s around which a number of
comparisons can be made. Each of the five sections of the pAshupata
sUtra-s end with one of the brahma-mantra-s. However, the pa\~ncha
brahma mantra-s have distinct origins. The rudra gAyatrI is part of the
shatarudrIya of both the maitrAyaNIya and kaTha saMhitA-s, whereas the
aghora (bahurUpI) is part of the shatarudrIya of the maitrAyaNIya-s.
These two mantra-s are used in these kR^iShNa-yajurvedic traditions as a
part of the shrauta ritual of the pacification of rudra after the 5th
layer of the agni-chiti is laid out in a soma sacrifice. They are known
by the technical names rudra sAvitrI and bahurUpI in the pAshupata
system. Both of them are deployed in the AV-pari 40 pAshupata ritual but
the other 3 brahma mantra-s are not mentioned in this version of the
ritual. The mantra of sadyojAta occurs as a kumAra mantra in the
atharvavedic tradition as a part of the skanda-yAga but is not deployed
in rudra worship in any parishiShTha tradition. Only in the taittirIya
AraNyaka (mahAnArAyaNopaniShat) and its atharva-vedic counterpart the 5
brahma-mantra-s are seen as a group. In the former it is occurs after
the li\~Nga sthApana mantra-s, but this group of li\~Nga mantra-s is
missing in the AV-mahAnArAyaNa. In ritual terms, the first mention of
the pa\~ncha brahma mantra-s is seen in the sections on iconic worship
of rudra in the baudhAyana gR^ihya sUtra-s. Here, three rituals for the
iconic worship of rudra are described (BGS 2.16-18). The first two for
the installation and daily worship of rudra images cite several rudra
mantra-s but not the pa\~nchabrahma.Interestingly these have mantra-s
similar to those deployed in the AV pari-40 pAshupata rite. The third of
these, termed ritual of the bathing of rudra (the precursor of the
famous mahAnyAsa) provides the deployment of the pa\~nchabrahma: the
sadyojAta mantra is used in AsanaM, pAdyaM, arghyaM, the vAmadeva in
sarvopachAra pUja, the aghora mantra in installing the benign form of
rudra, the tatpuruSha in japa and IshAna in seeking the grace of rudra.
A further ritual for the pacification of rudra on aShTamI evenings known
as the IshAnakalpa (BGS 3.15) also does not mention the pa\~nchabrahma
even though it deploys several rudra mantra-s.The absence of the 5
brahma mantra-s as a pentad in the AV pari-40 pAshupata system, but the
presence of only the two older members of the brahma mantra-s in this
system points to an internal evolution within the pAshupata system. The
brahma-mantra-s as a group are seen only in the baudhAyana rudrAbhiSheka
and the mahAnArAyaNa upaniShat-s of the taittirIya tradition (i.e. TA)
and the AV (without li\~Nga) among the vedic texts. Hence, it appears
quite possible that the brahma mantra-s as a group emerged in the
context of the early iconic worship of rudra (not necessarily as a
li\~Nga) in the late vedic tradition after the foundation of the initial
pAshupata system. The pAshupata sUtra-s specifically share only with the
taittirIya AraNyaka both the brahma-mantra-s and the li\~Nga worship.
This suggests that the beginning of the pAshupata sUtra tradition is
later than that of the AV pari-40 and specifically emerged amongst the
taittirIyin-s. To further test this conjecture let us look at the
brahma-mantra-s as transmitted by the pAshupata sUtra-s and its bhAShya:

There is some variation even within the different transmissions of the
taIttirIya AraNyaka 10 but the version here is the most widely used oral
tradition in bhAratavarSha. It is immediately apparent that the version
in the pAshupata sUtra-s is closest to the version in the TA 10. This
further supports the specific relationship between the pAshupata sUtra-s
and the TA 10 pAshupata tradition. This version of the mantra-s can also
been seen in the li\~NGa purANa (2.27.245-256) in the context of the
famous jayAbhiSheka rite performed by a shaiva mantravAdin for a rAjan
desiring victory over his enemies. While all mantra-s are not given in
full here, those that are closely match the PSu form indicating that
this transmission continued to exist in the shaiva world outside of the
TA and the PSu. In contrast, the version transmitted by the bhAShya is:
1) in the form of metrically regular anuShTubh-s, were relevant and 2)
closer to other texts than the TA. In the case of the sadyojAta and
aghora mantra-s the bhAShya form follows the reading in the dhUrta kalpa
of the AV pari-20 and the maitrAyaNIya saMhitA respectively. Further,
other major transmissions of the brahma mantra-s in the mantra-mArga
shaiva and vaiShNava pA\~ncharAtra systems closely resemble the version
in the bhAShya. In the early siddhAnta tantra the niHshvAsa saMhitA,
where the mantra-s are cited in full, they follow the bhAShya version.
The Indonesian mantra manual (now extant only in Bali) also gives these
mantra-s in a form close to the bhAShya version. The Indonesian manual
is derived from a mantra-mArga shaiva source, most probably a siddhAnta
tantra, supporting this version being transmitted by the saiddhAntika-s.
The version transmitted by the pA\~ncharAtrika sanatkumAra tantra also
reads very close to the bhAShya version. Thus, kauNDinya was not using
the form given in the mUla-sUtra pATha or the TA but his own version
that has also widely been transmitted in successor texts. There is a
hint that kauNDinya was not a taittirIyaka and did not know of that
these mantra-s were part of the taittirIyaka shruti. In explaining the
sUtra 1.39 (*atredaM brahma japet |* in PSu; *atrachedam brahma japet |*
in bhAShya) he says (for the word idam):  
*idam iti pratyakShe | niyoge vA | idam eva brahma japatavyam |
R^ig-yajuH-sAmAnItyarthaH |**  
* idam means in the current place an injunction (niyoga) to do japa of
this \[i.e. sadyojAta\] mantra and not a R^ik, yajur or a sAman. Thus,
it appears that he does not consider the sadyojAta mantra a vedic one.
Elsewhere, he does consider it R^ik in the sense of being a metrical
formula (e.g. in bhAShaya to Psu 5.21) suggesting that in the above case
he means it is not a mantra from one of the 3 veda-s supporting the idea
that he was unfamiliar with the TA 10. Thus, interestingly kauNDinya’s
transmission is independent of the PSu, which belongs to the same
tradition as TA 10.

In conclusion, we note that the pAshupata sUtra-s are not the beginning
of the pAshupata system but are preceded by a number of pre-sUtra
pAshupata teachings. The textual comparisons show that PSu pAshupata
darshana is closest to the version practiced in the mAhAbharata and
shows distinct links in the form the brahma mantra-s and the li\~Nga
worship with the taittirIya AraNyaka’s last section. Though, the
pAshupata system arose early from the ancestral Indo-Aryan ascetic
tradition, it appears to have interacted with the developing iconic
worship of shiva, particularly in terms of incorporating the brahma
mantra-s. In terms of the evolution of the brahma mantra-s, we note that
the bahurUpI and the rudra-gayatrI were recruited earlier and the
sadyojAta mantra emerged in the iconic worship of kumAra. But the brahma
mantra-s as group appears to have been put together in the late vedic
period for the iconic worship of rudra. This tradition of worship with
the pa\~nchabrahma appears to have been particularly vigorous amongst
the taittirIyaka-s and was incorporated into their vedic corpus. It is
from this taittirIyaka tradition that the mUla-sUtra pATha that we have
appears to have emerged. But the presence of distinct sUtra and
pa\~nchabrahma readings in the kauNDinya bhAShya indicate that there was
a transmission independently of the taittirIyaka-s that was partially
normalized in the post-kauNDinya transmission. The great epic pashupata
system is likely to have been coeval or post-dated the Ur-pAshupata
sUtra-s but predated the kauNDinya bhAShya with the narrative of shiva
animating a brAhmaNa’s body.

footnote 1: In our reckoning the first proto-pAshupata layer is
represented by the late vedic material such as the shvetAshvatara (early
first layer; of course the parallel nIlarudra is drawn from the AV-P
saMhitA itself ) and atharvashiras (late first layer; perhaps also
includes the sAmavedic kena). The pAshupata ritual of the
AV-parishiShTha appears in the form of sUtra-like prescriptions and
might correspond to a pashupata practice immediately subsequent to the
first layer. This was then followed by the pAshupata system described in
the great epic. The system in the AV-pari 40 also appears to represent a
precursor of the system expounded in the pAshupata sUtra-s. (see above
for further discussion).
