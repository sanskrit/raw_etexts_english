## CHAPTER XIII.

  

VERBAL ADJECTIVES AND NOUNS: PARTICIPLES, INFINITIVES, GERUNDS.

951 a. THOSE verbal adjectives, or participles, which are made from
tense-stems, and so constitute a part of the various tense-systems, have
been already treated. It remains to describe certain others, which,
being made directly from the root itself, belong to the verbal system as
a whole, and not to any particular part of it.

b\. The infinitive (with a few sporadic exceptions in the older
language) also comes in all cases from the root directly, and not from
any of the derived tense-stems.

c\. The same is true of the so-called gerunds, or indeclinable
participles.

Passive Participle in `tá` or `ná`.

952\. By accented suffix त `tá` — or, in a comparatively small number of
verbs, न `ná` — is formed a verbal adjective which, when coming from
transitive verbs, qualifies anything as having endured the action
expressed by the verb: thus, दत्त `dattá` *given*; उक्त `uktá` *spoken*.
Hence it is usually called the passive participle; or, to distinguish it
from the participle belonging to the passive present-system (771), the
past passive participle.

a\. When made from an intransitive or neuter verb, the same participle,
as in other languages, has no passive but only an indefinite past sense:
thus, गत `gatá` *gone*; भूत `bhūtá` *been*; पतित `patitá` *fallen*.

953\. In general, this participle is made by adding त `tá` to the bare
verbal root, with observation of the ordinary rules of euphonic
combination.

a\. Some roots, however, require the prefixion of the auxiliary vowel
`i` to the suffix. For these, and for the verbs that add `ná` instead of
`tá`, see below, 956, 957. 

b\. As to the accent when the root is preceded by a preposition, see
1085 a.

954\. The root before त `tá` has usually its weakest form, if there is
anywhere in the verbal system a distinction of weak and strong forms.
Thus:

a\. A penultimate nasal is not seldom dropped: examples are `aktá`
(√`añj`), `baddhá` (√`bandh`), `çrabdha` (√`çrambh`), `daṣṭá` (√`daṅç`),
`srasta` (√`sraṅs`), `bāḍha` (√`baṅh`).

b\. Roots which are abbreviated in the weak forms of the perfect (794)
suffer the same abbreviation here: examples are `uktá` (√`vac`), `uṣṭá`
(√`vas` *shine*), `uptá` (√`vap`: also `vapta`), `ūḍhá` (√`vah`),
`suptá` (√`svap`), `iṣṭá` (√`yaj`), `viddhá` (√`vyadh`); — and, by a
similar procedure, √`prach` (or `praç`) makes `pṛṣṭá`, √`bhraṅç` makes
`bhṛṣṭa` (beside the regular `bhraṣṭá`), and √`çra` *boil* makes `çṛṭá`
(beside `çrātá`).

c\. Final `ā` is weakened to `ī` in `gītá` (√`gā` *sing*), `dhītá`
(√`dhā` *suck*), `pītá` (√`pā` *drink*), `sphīta`; and
`jītá, vītá, çītá` are made from the roots `jyā, vyā, çyā`, (or `jī`
etc.); — and further to `i` in `chitá` (beside `chātá`), `dita` (√`dā`
*divide* and `dā` *bind*), `drita` (? √`drā` *sleep*), `hitá` (√`dhā`
*put*: with `h` for `dh`; but `dhita` also occurs in V.), `mitá` (√`mā`
*measure*), `çitá` (also `çāta`), `sitá, sthitá`.

d\. A final `m` is lost after `a` in `gatá, natá, yatá, ratá` (from
√`gam` etc.); and a final `n` in `kṣata, tatá, matá, hatá`. As to the
other roots in `am` and `an` taking `ta`, see 955 a, b.

e\. More isolated cases are -`ūta` (RV.: √`av`), `utá` or `ūta` (√`vā`
*weave*), `çiṣṭá` (also `çāsta`: √`çās`), `mūrtá` (referred to
√`mūrch`). As to -`gdha` and `jagdhá`, see 233 f.

f\. On the other hand, √`svad` makes `svāttá`.

955\. Of more irregular character are the following:

a\. A number of roots ending in `am` retain the nasal, and lengthen the
radical vowel (as also in some others of their verbal forms): thus,
`kāṁta, krāṁtá, klāṁtá, kṣāṁta, cāṁta, tāṁtá, dāṁtá, bhrāṁta, vāṁtá, çāṁtá`
(√`çam` *be quiet*), `çrāṁtá` (from √`kam` etc.); and one in `an`,
`dhvan` *sound*, makes `dhvāntá`.

b\. A few roots in `an` make their participle from another root-form in
`ā`: thus, `khātá, jātá`, -`vāta, sātá`; `dham` has both `dhamitá` and
`dhmātá`.

c\. Certain roots in `īv` take their `yū`-form (765 a): thus, `dyūtá`
(√`dīv` *play*), `ṣṭhyūta, syūtá`; but √`mīv` *makes* -`mūta`.

d\. From roots in changeable `ṛ` (generally taking `na`: 957 b) are made
also `pūrtá` (√`pṛ` *fill*: beside `pṛta`), `çīrta` and `çūrtá` (√`çṛ`
*crush*); and `çīrta` is further made from √`çrī` *mix*. 

e\. Double forms are `mugdhá` and `mūḍha, sāḍhá` and `soḍha, dhūrta` and
`dhruta, hvṛta` and `hrutá`.

f\. The root `dā` *give* makes `dattá` (from the secondary root-form
`dad`; but `dāta` also in V.). But the anomalously contracted form
-`tta` (as if for `dāta`, with the radical vowel lost) is also frequent
in composition, especially with prepositions: thus,
`ā́tta, ánutta, párītta, prátta, prátītta`; rarely with other elements,
as `devátta, punartta, marútta` (?). And the same abbreviated form comes
from √`dā` *divide* in `ávatta`.

g\. The roots making participles in both `ta` and `ita`, or `ta` and
`na`, or in all three, will be noted in the next two paragraphs.

956\. The suffix with इ `i`, or in the form इत `itá`, used especially
with roots having finals that are only with difficulty, if at all,
combinable with त् `t` according to the usual analogies of the language,
and often with roots of a secondary, derivative, or late character; but
also not seldom with original roots.

a\. Thus, of roots presenting difficulties of combination: — 1. all that
end in two consonants (save those of which one consonant is lost by a
weakening process: 964 a, b): e. g.
`çan̄k, valg, vāñch, lajj, ubj, ceṣṭ, ghūrṇ, katth, nind, jalp, cumb, umbh, khall, pinv, çaṅs`
(also `çastá`), `rakṣ, hiṅs, garh` (in all, over fifty); but `takṣ`
makes `taṣṭá`; — 2. all that end in linguals (including `ṣ` after `a` or
`ā`): e. g. `aṭ, truṭ, paṭh, luṭh, īḍ, vruḍ, bhaṇ, kaṣ, bhāṣ`; — 3. all
that end in surd spirants: e. g. `likh, grath, nāth, kuth, riph, guph`;
— 4. all that end in `l`: e. g. `cal, gil, mīl, lul, khel`: — 6. all
that end in other persistent semivowels: namely, `carv` (also `cūrṇa`),
`jīv` (for the other roots in `īv`, see 955 c), `dhāv` *run*,
`sev, day, vyay, pūy`; — 6. `ujh`. — This class includes more than half
of the whole number that take only `ita`.

b\. Of other roots ending in consonants: — 1. in gutturals, `cak, ḍhāuk`
(`çak` has both `ta` and `ita`); `çlāgh`; — 2. in palatals, `ac` (also
`akná`), `uc, kuc, khac, yāc, ruc`; `aj`?, `kūj, vraj`, also `tyaj` and
`mṛj` in late texts (usually `tyaktá` and `mṛṣṭá`); — 3. in dentals,
`at, pat, çcut`, also `yat` in epos (elsewhere only `yattá`);
`krad, khād, gad, cud, nad, mud, mṛd, rad, rud, vad, vid` *know*,
`hrād`; also `nud` in epos (elsewhere `nuttá` and `nunna`); `mad` has
both `mattá` and `maditá` (the majority of roots in `d` take `na`: 957
d); `edh, kṣudh, gadh, dudh, nādh, bādh, spardh`;
`an, in, kvan, dhvan, pan, ran` *ring*, `van, stan, svan`, and `dhvan`
(also `dhvāntá`); — 4. in labials, `cup, yup, rup`, and usually `kup`
(`kupta` late) and `lap` (`lapta` epic), occasionally
`kṣip, gup, tap, dṛp, vap, çap`, while `jap` has both `ta` and `ita`;
`grabh` (`gṛbhītá`), `çubh, skabh`, and occasionally `lubh`, while
`kṣubh` and `stabh` have both forms; `tim, dham, çam` *labor*, `stim`,
and `kṣam` in epos (also `kṣāṁta`); — 5. in spirants, `aç` *eat*,
`īç, kāç, kṛç, vāç, çac`, while `piç` has both forms, and `mṛç` takes
`ita` only late; `iṣ` *send*,
`īṣ, kuṣ, tṛṣ, tviṣ, pruṣ, miṣ, rūṣ, heṣ, hreṣ`, also `muṣ` except late,
while `dhṛṣ, ruṣ`, and `hṛṣ` show both forms;
`ās, bhas, bhās, ras, las, vas` *clothe*, `has`, also `as` *throw*
occasionally, while `kas, gras, yas, vas` *shine*, `vas` *dwell*, `çās`
(with `çiṣṭá` and `çāsta`), `çvas`, and `hras` make both forms;
`īh, grah` (`gṛhītá`), `jah` (secondary form of `hā`), `mah, rah`, and
occasionally `ūh` *remove*, while `gāh` has both forms.

c\. Of roots ending in vowels, only `çī` *lie*, which makes `çayita`
(with `guṇa` of root, as elsewhere: 629).

d\. In general, a root maintains its full form before `ita`; but there
are a few exceptions: thus, `gṛbhītá` and `gṛhītá` (the root being
reckoned as `grabh` and `grah`: see 729), `uditá` (also `vadita` in the
later language), `uṣita` (√`vas` *shine*; beside `uṣṭá`), `uṣita`
(√`vas` *dwell*: also sporadically `vasita` and `uṣṭa`), `ukṣitá`
(√`vaká` *increase*), `çṛthitá` (√`çrath`). From √`mṛj` are made both
`mṛjita` and `mārjita` (with strengthening as in present and elsewhere:
627), beside `mṛṣṭá`.

e\. Instead of `i`, long `ī` is taken in `gṛbhītá` and `gṛhītá`.

957\. The suffix न `ná` (always without auxiliary इ `i`) is taken
instead of त `tá` by a number of roots (about seventy). Thus:

a\. Certain roots in `ā`: thus, `kṣā, glā, drā` *run*, `drā` *sleep*,
(also `drita`?), `mlā` (also `mlātá`), `vā` *blow* (also `vāta`), `çyā`
(also `çīná`), `styā, hā` *leave* (also `hīná` and `hāta`), `hā` *go
forth*; and `dā` *divide* makes `diná` (also `dita` and -`tta`).
Further, certain roots in `i`- and `u`-vowels: thus, `kṣi` *destroy*
(`kṣīṇa`; also `kṣitá`), `ḍī, pī, lī` *cling*, `vlī, çī` or `çyā`
*coagulate* (beside `çyāna` and `çīta`), `hrī` (beside `hrīta`); `dū`
*burn* (also `duta`), `lū, çū`; and `dīv` *lament* makes `dyūna`
(compare 765).

b\. Roots in `ṛ`, which before the suffix becomes `īr` or `ūr`: the
forms are, `arṇa` (late; beside `ṛtá`), `kīrṇa` (√`kṛ` *scatter*),
`gīrṇá` (√`gṛ` *swallow*), `jīrṇá` and `jūrṇá` (√`jṛ` *waste away*),
`tīrṇá` and `tūrṇa` (also `tūrtá`), `dīrṇá` (√`dṛ` *pierce*: also
`dṛta`), `pūrṇá` (√`pṛ` *fill*: also `pūrtá` and `pṛta`), `mūrṇá` (√`mṛ`
*crush*), `çīrṇá` (√`çṛ` *crush*: also `çīrta` and `çūrtá`?), `stīrṇá`
(also `stṛta`). Of like character with these are `īrṇá` from
√`īr, cīrṇa` (beside `carita`) from √`car`, `gūrṇa` (beside `gūrtá`)
from √`gur`, a secondary form of `gṛ`, and `cūrṇa` (beside `carvita`)
from √`carv`, which is also plainly a secondary root.

c\. A few roots ending in `j` (which becomes `g` before the suffix,
against the usual rule of internal combination: 216 f): thus, `bhagna`
(√`bhañj`), `bhugna` (√`bhuj` *bend*), `magná` (√`majj`), `rugṇá, vigna`
(beside `vikta`). Further, two or three ending in `c` (similarly
treated): thus, `akná` (√`ac` or `añc`: also `acita` and `añcita`),
`vṛkná` (√`vraçc`), and apparently -`pṛgṇa` (RV., once: with doubly
irregular change of root-final, from √`pṛc`). And one root in `g`,
`lagna`. 

d\. A considerable number, some of them very common ones, of roots in
`d` (which, against ordinary rule, becomes `n` before the suffix: 157
b). The forms are: `unna` (also `utta`), `arṇṇa`?,
`klinna, kṣuṇṇa, kṣviṇṇa, khinna, channa, chinná, chṛṇṇá, tunná, tṛṇṇá, nunna`
(also `nuttá` and `nudita`), `panná, bhinná, vinna` (√`vid` *find*: also
`vittá`), `çanna` (√`çad` *fall*), `sanná` (also `sattá`), `skanná`
(√`skand`), `syanná` (√`syand`), `svinná, hanna`. And `ánna` *food*, in
spite of its different accent, appears to be a like formation from √`ad`
*eat*.

958\. The native grammarians reckon as participles of this formation a
few miscellaneous derivative adjectives, coming from roots which do not
make a regular participle: such are `kṣāma` *burnt*, `kṛçá` *emaciated*,
`pakvá` *ripe*, `phullá` *expanded*, `çúṣka` *dry*.

Past Active Participle in `tavant` (or `navant`).

959\. From the past passive participle, of whatever formation, is made,
by adding the possessive suffix वन्त् `vant`, a secondary derivative
having the meaning and construction of a perfect active participle: for
example, तत् कृतवान् `tát kṛtávān` *having done that*; `taṁ nigīrṇavān`
*having swallowed him down*. Its inflection is like that of other
derivatives made with this suffix (452 ff.); its feminine ends in वती
`vatī`; its accent remains on the participle.

960\. Derivative words of this formation are found in RV., but without
anything like a participial value. The AV. has a single example, with
participial meaning: `açitā́vaty átithāu` *one's guest having eaten*
(loc. abs.). In the Brāhmaṇas also it is hardly met with. In the later
language, however, it comes to be quite common. And there it is chiefly
used predicatively, and oftenest without copula expressed, or with the
value of a personal verb-form in a past tense: primarily, and not
seldom, signifying immediate past, or having a true "perfect" value; but
also (like the old perfect and the old aorist in later use) coming to be
freely used for indefinite time, or with the value of the imperfect
(779). For example: `māṁ na kaçcid dṛṣṭavān` *no one has seen* (or
*saw*) *me*; `sa nakulaṁ vyāpāditavān` *he destroyed the ichneumon*; or,
with copula, `mahat kṛcchram prāptavaty asi` *thou hast fallen upon
great misery*. Although originally and properly made only from
transitive verbs (with an object, to which the participle in `ta` stands
in the relation of an objective predicate), it is finally found also
from intransitives: thus, `cūtena saṁçritavatī` (Ç.) *has become united
with the mango-tree*; `gatavatī` (ib.) *she has gone*.

a\. The same participle is also made in the secondary conjugations: e.
g. `darçitavant` *having shown*, `prabodhitavant` *having awakened*. 

b\. Possessives also in `in` made from passive participles are sometimes
found used in an analogous manner, nearly as perfect active participles:
e. g. `iṣṭín` *having sacrificed*, `vijitino manyamānāḥ` (AB.) *thinking
themselves to have conquered*.

Future Passive Participles: Gerundives.

961\. Certain derivative adjectives (for the most part more or less
clearly secondary derivatives) have acquired in the language a value as
qualifying something which is to, or which ought to, suffer the action
expressed by the root from which they come; and they are allowed to be
made from every verb. Hence they are, like more proper participles,
sometimes treated as a part of the general verbal system, and called
future passive participles, or gerundives (like the Latin forms in
*ndus*, to which they correspond in meaning).

962\. The suffixes by which such gerundives are regularly and ordinarily
made are three: namely य `ya`, तव्य `tavya`, and अनीय `anīya`.

a\. Derivatives in `ya` having this value are made in all periods of the
language, from the earliest down; the other two are of more modern
origin, being entirely wanting in the oldest Veda (RV.), and hardly
known in the later. Other derivatives of a similar character, which
afterward disappear from use, are found in the Veda (966).

963\. The suffix `ya` in its gerundive use has nothing to distinguish it
from the same suffix as employed to make adjectives and nouns of other
character (see below, 1213). And it exhibits also the same variety in
the treatment of the root.

a\. The original value of the suffix is `ia`, and as such it has to be
read in the very great majority of its Vedic occurrences. Hence the
conversion of `e` and `o` to `ay` and `av` before it (see below).

b\. Thus: 1. Final `ā` becomes `e` before the suffix:
`déya, dhyeya, khyéya, méya` (perhaps `dā́-ia` etc., with euphonic `y`
interposed); but RV. has once `-jñāya`. — 2. The other vowels either
remain unchanged, or have the `guṇa` or the `vṛddhi` strengthening; and
`e` usually and `o` always are treated before the `ya` as they would be
before a vowel: thus,
`-kṣayya, jáyya, bháyya, lāyya; návya, bhávya, hávya, bhāvyá; vā́rya`:
and, in the later language, `nīya, jeya, dhūya` (such cases are wanting
earlier). In a few instances, a short vowel adds `t` before the suffix:
thus, `itya, mitya, çrútya, stútya, kṛtya` (the only Vedic examples). —
3. Medial `a` remains unchanged or is lengthened: thus,
`dábhya, vándya, sádya`; `mā́dya, vā́cya`. — 4. Medial `i`-, `u`-, and
`ṛ`-vowels are unchanged or have the `guṇa`-strengthening: thus,
`ī́ḍya, gúhya, dhṛṣya`; `dvéṣya, yódhya, márjya`.

c\. The RV. has about forty examples of this gerundive, and the AV. adds
half as many more. Except in `bhāviá` (once), the accent in RV. is
always on the root; AV. has several cases of accent on the `i` of the
suffix (hence written `ādyà, āçyà, -vyādhyà, -dharṣyà`). According to
the grammarians, the accent is on the root or else the ending is
circumflexed: always the former, if the `ya` follow a vowel.

964\. a. The suffix `tavya` is a secondary adjective derivative from the
infinitival noun in `tu` (below, 968), made by adding the suffix `ya`
(properly `ía`, whence the accent `yà`), before which the final `u`, as
usual (1203 a), has `guṇa`-strengthening, and is resolved into `av`.+++(5)+++

b\. Hence, as regards both the form taken by the root and the use or
omission of an auxiliary vowel `i` before the `tavya`, the rules are the
same as for the formation of the infinitive (below, 968).

c\. No example of this formation is found in RV., and in AV. occur only
two, `janitavyà` and `hiṅsitavyà`. In the Brāhmaṇa language it begins to
be not rare, and is made both from the simple root and from the derived
conjugational stems (next chapter); in the classical language it is
still more frequent. According to the grammarians, the accent of the
word is either circumflex on the final or acute on the penult: thus,
`kartavyà` or `kartávya`; in the accentuated texts, it is always the
former (the accent `távya` given to certain gerundives in the Petersburg
lexicons is an error, growing out of the ambiguous accentuation of ÇB.:
88 c).

965\. a. The suffix `anīya` is in like manner the product of secondary
derivation, made by adding the adjective suffix `īya` (1215) to a *nomen
actionis* formed by the common suffix `ana`.

b\. It follows, then, as regards its mode of formation, the rules for
the suffix `ana` (below, 1150).

c\. This derivative also is unknown in RV., and in AV. is found only in
`upajīvanī́ya` and `āmantranī́ya` (in both of which, moreover, its
distinct gerundive value admits of question). In the Brāhmaṇas (where
less than a dozen examples of it have been noted), and in the later
language, it is less common than the gerundive in `tavya`. Its accent,
as in all the derivatives with the suffix `īya`, is on the penult: thus,
`karaṇī́ya`.

966\. Other formations of kindred value are found in the Veda as
follows:

a\. Gerundives in `tua` or `tva`, apparently made from the infinitival
noun in `tu` with the added suffix `a` (1209). They are `kártua` (in two
occurrences `kártva`), -`gaṁtva, jántua, jétua, náṁtua, váktua, sótua`,
`snā́tua, hántua, hétua, hótva`; and, with auxiliary `i` (or `ī`),
`jánitva, sánitva, bhávītva`.

b\. Gerundives in `enia` or `enya` (compare 1217): they are
`īkṣeṇía, īḍénia, caréṇia, dṛçénia`,
-`dviṣeṇia, bhūṣéṇya, yudhénia, váreṇia` (and `bhajenya` BhP.); with one
example from an apparent aorist-stem, `yaṁsénya`, and three or four from
secondary verb-stems (see below, 1019, 1038, 1068 a).

c\. Gerundives in `ā́yia` (once `ā́yya`: compare 1218): they are
`dakṣā́yia, panā́yia, vidā́yia, çravā́yia, hnavāyia`; with a few from
secondary conjugation-stems (below, 1019, 1038, 1051, 1068a); and
`stuṣéyia` is of close kindred with them.

d\. A few adjectives in `elima`, as `pacelima, bhidelima` (only these
quotable), are reckoned as gerundives by the grammarians.

967\. The division-line between participial and ordinary adjectives is
less strictly drawn in Sanskrit than in the other Indo-European
languages. Thus, adjectives in `u`, as will be seen later (1178), from
secondary conjugational stems, have participial value; and in the
Brāhmaṇas (with an example or two in AV.) is found widely and commonly
used a participial adjective formed with the suffix `uka` (1180).

Infinitives.

968\. The later language has only a single infinitive, which is the
accusative case of a verbal noun formed by the suffix तु `tu`, added to
the root usually directly, but often also with aid of the preceding
auxiliary vowel इ `i`. The form of the infinitive ending, therefore, is
तुम् `tum` or इतुम् `itum`. The root has the `guṇa`-strengthening, and
is accented. Thus, for example, एतुम् `étum` from √इ `i`; कर्तुम्
`kártum` from √कृ `kṛ`; चरितुम् `cáritum` from √चर् `car`; भवितुम्
`bhávitum` from √भू `bhū`.

a\. As regards the use or omission of `i`, the infinitive (as also the
gerund in `tvā`: 991) follows in general the analogy of the passive
participle (956). Examples are (with the gerund added) as follows:
`dagdhá, dágdhum, dagdhvā́` from √`dah`; `bhinná, bhéttum, bhittvā́` from
√`bhid`; `matá, mántum, matvā́` from √`man`; `ūḍhá, vóḍhum, ūḍhvā́` from
√`vah`; `patitá, pátitum, patitvā́` from √`pat`;
`yācitá, yā́citum, yācitvā́` from √`yāc`; `çayitá, çáyitum, çayitvā́` from
√`çī`. But certain exceptions and special cases require notice. Thus:

b\. Of roots having no quotable participle, infinitive stems in `tu` are
made from `ad, sagh`; in `itu` from `uñch`, `ūh` *consider*,
`kṣap, luṇṭh, lok, svar`; and in both from `yabh`. 

c\. Of roots making participles of both forms, an infinitive stem in
`tu` only is quotable for `kṣip, kṣubh, tap, tyaj, mṛç, lubh, vas`
*shine*, `çak, stabh`; only in `itu` for
`gāh, carv, jap, mad, yat, van, çaṅs, çvas`; in both for `as` *throw*,
`ūh` *remove*, `gup, car, mṛj` (`mā̆rṣṭu, mārjitu`), `lap, vas` *dwell*,
`çap, çās`.

d\. Also in a number of other cases (besides those already noticed) an
infinitive stem is made both with and without `i`. Thus, in addition to
the more regular form, a stem in `itu` is occasionally met with from
roots `aç` *attain*, `iṣ` *seek*, `bandh, bhaj, yaj` (`ījitum`), `rudh`
*obstruct*, `ruh, vṛṣ, sad` (`sīditum`), `sah, han, hṛ`; and one in `tu`
from roots `ās, bhāṣ, vid` *know*. Both forms occur also from certain
`am`-roots, namely `nam, yam, ram`, and, with `ā` before `tu` as in the
pple, `kram` and `bhram` (`kṣam` has only `kṣaṁtu`, against the analogy
of `kṣāṁta`); further, from certain roots in variable `ṛ`, namely `tṛ`
(`tartu, tarī̆tu`), `vṛ` *cover* (`vártu, varī̆tu`), and `stṛ`
(`stártu, staritu, stárītu`) (but from `çṛ` *crush* occur only
`çárītu, çaritu`, and from `vṛ` *choose* only `varītu`; while `gṛ`
*swallow* and `pṛ` *fill* make their infinitive from other root-forms,
namely `giritum, pūritum`); further, from a few vowel-roots, namely
`nī, cyu, sū` (`sū́tu`); and finally from `kṛṣ, nṛt, çuc`.

e\. Against the analogy of the participle, infinitive-stems in `itu`
after a final consonant are made from the roots `av, kṣan, khan` and
`jan` (the pples coming from `khā` and `jā`), `guh, jabh, tam, dīv`
*play* and `dīv` *lament* (both `devitu`), `majj, vṛt, vṛdh, sṛp`; and
after a final vowel, from roots in `ū`, namely `pū, bhū, sū` (also
`sūtu`), and from `çri` and `çvi`; as to roots in variable `ṛ`, see just
above, d.

f\. As the infinitive is made from the (accented and) strengthened root,
so it naturally has, as a rule, the stronger or fuller root-form where a
weaker or contracted form is taken by the participle (and gerund in
`tvā́`): e. g. `váktu` against `uktá` (and `uktvā́`), `yáṣṭu` against
`iṣṭá` (and `iṣṭvā́`), `banddhum` against `baddhá` (and `baddhvā́`), and
so on. Deserving special notice are `gātu` (√`gā` *sing*) against
`gītá`, and `dhā́tu` (√`dhā` *suck*) against `dhītá`; and so from `dā`
*give* and `hā` *leave* are made only `dā́tu` and `hātu`; but `dhā`
*put*, `mā` *measure*, and `sthā` add to the regular
`dhātu, mātu, sthātu` the late forms -`dhitu`, -`mitu`, -`sthitu`; and
`sā` or `si` has `sātu, sétu`, and -`situ`; `vā` *weave* (pple `utá`)
has both `vā́tu` and `ótu`; `hū` or `hvā` has `havītu, hváyitu`, and
`hvātu`. The root `vyadh` makes its only quotable infinitive, `veddhum`,
from its `vidh`-form; from sañj or saj occur both san̄ktu and saktu. The
anomalous epic forms `ījitum` (√`yaj`) and `sīditum` (√`sad`), were
mentioned above. The root `grab` makes `gráhītum`.

g\. In the later language, the infinitive-stem forms possessive
compounds with `kāma` and `manas` (especially the former): e. g.
`svaptukāma` *having the wish to sleep*, `yaṣṭukāma` *desirous of
sacrificing*, `vaktumanas` *minded to speak*.

h\. In very rare instances, dative infinitives in `tave` or `tavāi` are
made from the infinitive stem in the later language (as abundantly in
the earlier: 970 b): thus, `pratihartave` (BhP.). And `jīvase` (973 a)
is once found in MBh. (i. 3. 67 = 732), in a quasi-Vedic hymn to the
Açvins.

969\. In the Veda and Brāhmaṇa, however, a number of verbal nouns,
*nomina actionis*, in various of their cases, are used in constructions
which assimilate them to the infinitive of other languages — although,
were it not for these other later and more developed and pronounced
infinitives, the constructions in question might pass as ordinary
case-constructions of a somewhat peculiar kind.

970\. The nouns thus used infinitively are the following:

a\. The root-noun, without derivative suffix, is so used in its
accusative in `am`, its dative in `e` or (from `ā`-roots) `āi`, its
genitive and ablative in `as`, and its locative in `i`.

b\. The verbal noun in `tu` is so used in its accusative in tum, its
dative in `tave` or `tavāí`, and its ablative and genitive in `tos`.

Of other nouns only single cases, generally datives, are reckoned as
used with infinitive value; thus:

c\. From the verbal noun in `as`, the dative in `ase`; and also, in an
extremely small number of instances, a dative in `se` (or `ṣe`), from a
noun formed with `s` simply.

d\. From nouns in `man` and `van`, datives in `mane` and `vane`.

e\. From nouns in `ti`, datives in `taye`, or (from one or two verbs) in
`tyāi`.

f\. From nouns in `i`, datives in `áye`.

g\. From nouns in `dhi` and `ṣi`, datives in `dhyāi` and `ṣyāi`.

h\. A few infinitives in `ṣaṇi` are perhaps locatives from nouns in `an`
added to a root increased by `s`.

i\. From a single root, `dhṛ`, are made infinitively used forms in
`tári`, of which the grammatical character is questionable.

j\. Among all these, the forms which have best right to special
treatment as infinitives, on account of being of peculiar formation, or
from suffixes not found in other uses, or for both reasons, are those in
`ṣe, ṣaṇi, tari, dhyāi`, and `tavāi`.

k\. Except the various cases of the derivative in `tu`, and of the
root-noun, these infinitives are almost wholly unknown outside the
Rig-Veda.

l\. Other suffixes and forms than those noticed above might be added;
for it is impossible to draw any fixed line between the uses classed as
infinitive and the ordinary case-uses: thus, `prajā́patim praçnám āitām`
(TS.) *they went to ask Prajāpati*; `víçvaṁ jīvám prasuvántī carā́yāi`
(RV.) *quickening every living being to motion*; `apáḥ sármāya codáyan`
(RV.) *impelling the waters to flow*; `çaknuyā́d gráhaṇāya` (instead of
the usual `gráhītum`: ÇB.) *may be able to apprehend*; `ā tamanāt`
(instead of the usual `tamitoḥ`: S.) *until exhaustion*. And the
so-called infinitives are found coördinated in the same sentence with
common nouns, and even with compound nouns: e. g.
`cáritave... ābhogáya iṣṭáye rāyé` (RV.) *to go abroad, to enjoy, to
seek wealth*; `ārtatrāṇāya na prahartum anāgasi` (Ç.) *for the rescue of
the distressed, not for hurling at the innocent*.

More special rules as to the various formations are as follows:

971\. The root-noun used as infinitive has the same form (except that it
does not take an added `t`: 383 f), and the same accent, both when
simple and when combined with prepositions, as in its other uses. In the
very great majority of instances, it is made from roots ending in a
consonant; but also from a few in `ā` (`khyā, dā, dhā, pā`?, `mā, yā`),
from two or three in `i`- and `u`-vowels (`hi, mī, bhū`), and from one
or two in changeable `ṛ`, which takes the `ir`-form (`tir, stir`).

a\. The roots in `ā` form the accus. in `ām`, the dat. in `āi`, the abl.
in `ās` (understanding `avasā́` before `ā́` as for `avasā́s` and not
`avasāí` in RV. iii. 53. 20), and the locative in `e` (only two
examples, of which one is perhaps better understood as dative).

972\. The infinitive noun in `tu` is made freely from roots of every
form. The root takes the `guṇa`-strengthening, if capable of it, and
often adds the auxiliary vowel `i` before the suffix (according to the
rules already stated, 968). The root is accented, unless the noun be
combined with a preposition, in which case the latter has the accent
instead: thus, `kártum, étave, hántos`; but
`níkartum, níretave, nírhantos`.

a\. The dative in `tavāi` is in two respects anomalous: in having the
heavy feminine ending `āi` along with a strengthened `u`; and in taking
a double accent, one on the root or on the prefixed preposition, and the
other on the ending `āi`: thus,
`étavāí, hántavāí, átyetavāí, ápabhartavāí`.

973\. a. The infinitive in `ase` is made in RV. from about twenty-five
roots; in AV. and later there have been noted no other examples of it.
In near three quarters of the cases, the accent is on the suffix: e. g.
`ṛñjáse, jīváse, bhiyáse, tujáse`; the exceptions are `cákṣase`;
`dhā́yase` (with `y` inserted before the suffix: 258); and
`áyase, bhárase, spárase, hárase` (with `guṇa`-strengthening of the
root). Strengthening of the root is also shown by
`javáse, doháse, bhojáse, çobháse`. In `puṣyáse` is seen, apparently,
the present-stem instead of the root.

b\. The ending `se` is extremely rare, being found only in `jiṣé` and
perhaps `stuṣé`, and one or two still more doubtful cases.

974\. Infinitives in `mane` are made from only five roots: thus,
`trā́maṇe, dā́mane, dármaṇe, bhármaṇe`, and (with different accent)
`vidmáne`. From √`dā` comes `dāváne`; `turváṇe` may come directly from
√`tṛ`, or through the secondary root `turv`; `dhū́rvaṇe` is rather from
√`dhūrv` than from √`dhvṛ`.

975\. a. The infinitives in `taye` are `iṣṭáye` (√`iṣ`), `pītáye` (√`pā`
*drink*), `vītáye`, `sātáye`, and perhaps `ūtáye` (`ūtáye nṝ́n` *to help
his men*: (RV.). In `tyāi`, the only examples noted are `ityāí` (RV.)
and `sā́ḍhyāi` (MS. AB.).

b\. With `aye` are formed
`iṣáye, tujáye, dṛçáye, maháye, yudháye, sanáye`; and `citáye` (VS.),
`gṛhaye` (K.).

976\. The ending `dhyāi` is, more than any other, irregular and various
in its treatment. It has always an `a` before it; and in the majority of
cases it is accented upon this `a`, and added to a weak form of root:
thus, `çucádhyāi, pṛṇádhyāi, dhiyádhyāi, huvádhyāi`. But the form of
root is the strong one in a few cases: namely,
`çayádhyāi, stavádhyāi, tarádhyāi, jarádhyāi, mandádhyāi, vandádhyāi`.
In half-a-dozen forms, again, the root has the accent: namely,
`kṣáradhyāi, gámadhyāi, yájadhyāi` (but once or twice also `yajádhyāi`),
`váhadhyāi, sáhadhyāi, bháradhyāi`. In a single instance, `píbadhyāi`,
the suffix is added distinctly to a present-stem; and in one,
`vāvṛdhádhyāi`, to a perfect stem. Finally, in a number of instances
(ten), this infinitive is made from a causative stem in `ay`: thus,
`mādayádhyāi, riṣayádhyāi`, etc.

a\. This infinitive is by no means rare in RV., being made in
thirty-five different forms (with seventy-two occurrences). But it is
hardly known outside of the RV.; the AV. has it but once (in a passage
found also in RV.); and elsewhere half-a-dozen examples have been
noticed, in `mantra`-passages (one of them TS. falsely reads
`gámadhye`); in the Brāhmaṇa language proper it appears to be entirely
wanting.

977\. An example or two are met with of an infinitive in `ṣyāi`: thus,
`róhiṣyāi` (TS.), `avyathiṣyāi` (K. Kap.; MS. `avyáthiṣe`; VS.
`vyathiṣat`), and perhaps -`dhāsyāi` (PGS.).

978\. The infinitives in `ṣaṇi` are: `iṣáṇi` (?) from √`iṣ` *send*,
-`bhūṣáṇi` from √`bhū`; `çūṣáṇi` from √`çū` or `çvā`; `neṣáṇi` from
√`nī`; `sakṣáṇi` from √`sah`; `parṣáṇi` from √`pṛ`, `tarīṣáṇi` from
√`tṛ`; and `gṛṇīṣáṇi` and -`stṛṇīṣáṇi` from √√`gṛ` and `stṛ` — the last
containing evident present tense-signs (compare the 1st sing. `gṛṇīṣé`,
894 d).

979\. The only infinitive in `tari` is `dhartári` (with its compound
`vidhartári`), from √`dhṛ`.

Uses of the Infinitives.

980\. The uses of the so-called infinitives are for the most part
closely accordant with those of the corresponding cases from other
abstract nouns. Thus:

981\. The accusative, which is made only from the root-noun and the noun
in `tu`, is used as object of a verb.

a\. Especially, of forms from the root `çak` *be able*, and `arh` *be
worthy, have the right or the power*. Thus, `çakéma tvā samídham` (RV.)
*may we accomplish thy kindling*; `mā́ çakan pratidhā́m íṣum` (AV.) *may
they not be able to fit the arrow to the string*; `máno vā́ imā́ṁ sadyáḥ `
`páryāptum arhati mánaḥ páribhavitum` (TS.) *the mind, forsooth, can at
once attain and surpass her*; `kó hy ètásyā́ ’rhati gúhyaṁ nā́ma gráhītum`
(ÇB.) *for who is worthy to take his secret name?* In the Veda, the
construction with these verbs is only one among others; in the Brāhmaṇa,
it becomes the greatly prevalent one (three quarters or more of all the
cases).

b\. Further, of verbs of motion (next most frequent case): thus,
`dā́kṣiṇāni hótum eti` (TS.) *he goes to sacrifice things pertaining to
sacrificial gifts*; `índram pratíram emy ā́yuḥ` (RV.) *I go to Indra for*
(i. e. *beseech of him*) *the lengthening out of life*; — of √`dhṛ`
*persist in, undertake*: as, `sá idáṁ jātáḥ sárvam evá dágdhuṁ dadhre`
(ÇB.) *he, as soon as born, began to burn this universe*; — of verbs
meaning *desire, hope, notice, know*, and the like: as,
`pā́çān vicṛ́taṁ vettha sárvān` (AV.) *thou knowest how to loosen all
bonds*; `tásmād agníṁ nā́ ”driyeta párihantum` (ÇB.) *therefore one
should not be careful to smother the fire*; — and of others.

982\. Of the infinitive datives, the fundamental and usual sense is that
expressed by *for, in order to, for the purpose of*.

Examples are: `víçaṁ jīváṁ caráse bodháyantī` (RV.) *awakening every
living creature to motion*; `tā́n úpa yāta píbadhyāi` (RV.) *come to
drink them*; `nāí ’tā́ṁ te devā́ adadur áttave` (AV.) *the gods did not
give her to thee for eating*; `praí ”d yudháye dásyum índraḥ` (RV.)
*Indra went forward to fight the demon*; `cákṣur no dhehi vikhyāí` (RV.)
*give us sight for looking abroad*.

Some peculiar constructions, however, grow out of this use of the
infinitive dative. Thus:

a\. The noun which is logically the subject or the object of the action
expressed by the infinitive is frequently put beside it in the dative
(by a construction which is in part a perfectly simple one, but which is
stretched beyond its natural boundaries by a kind of attraction): thus,
`cakāra sū́ryāya pánthām ánvetavā́ u` (RV.) *he made a track for the sun
to follow* (*made for the sun a track for his following*);
`çíçīte çṛ́n̄ge rákṣobhyo viníkṣe` (RV.) *he whets his horns to pierce the
demons*; `rudrā́ya dhánur a tanomi brahmadvíṣe çárave hántavā́ u` (RV.) *I
stretch the bow for Rudra, that with his arrow he may slay the*
`brahma`-*hater*; `asmábhyaṁ dṛçáye sū́ryāya púnar dātām ásum` (RV.) *may
they grant life again, that we may see the sun*.

b\. An infinitive with √`kṛ` *make* is used nearly in the sense of a
causative verb: thus, `prā́ ’ndháṁ çroṇáṁ cákṣasa étave kṛthaḥ` (RV.) *ye
make the blind and lame to see and go*; `agníṁ samídhe cakártha` (RV.)
*thou hast made the fire to be kindled*. Of similar character is an
occasional construction with another verb: as,
`yád īm uçmási kártave kárat tát` (RV.) *what we wish to be done, may he
do that*; `kavī́ṅr icchāmi saṁdṛ́çe` (RV.) *I desire to see the sages*.

c\. A dative infinitive is not seldom used as a predicate, sometimes
with, but more usually without, a copula expressed: thus,
`agnír iva ná pratidhṛ́ṣe bhavati` (TS.) *like fire, he is not to be
resisted*; `mahimā́ te anyéna ná saṁnáçe` (VS.) *thy greatness is not to
be attained by another*; `nákim índro níkartave ná çakráḥ páriçaktave`
(RV.) *Indra is not to be put down, the mighty one is not to be
overpowered*.

d\. Sometimes an infinitive so used without a copula has quite nearly
the value of an imperative: thus, `tyā́ me yaçásā... āuçijó huvádhyāi`
\[`asti`\] (RV.) *these glorious ones shall the son of Uçij invoke for
me*; `sūktébhir vaḥ... índrā nv àgnī́ ávase huvádhyāi` \[`staḥ`\] (RV.)
*with your hymns shall ye call now on Indra and Agni for aid*;
`vandádhyā agníṁ námobhiḥ` \[`asmi`\] (RV.) *let me greet Agni with
homage*; `asmā́kāsaç ca sūráyo víçvā ā́çās tarīṣáṇi` (RV.) *and let our
sacrifices cross all regions*; `tán nāí ’váṁ kártavāí` (MS.) *that must
not be done so*; `brahmadvíṣaḥ çárave hántavā́ u` (RV.) *let the arrow
slay the brahma-haters*. The infinitives in `dhyāi` and `ṣaṇi` (which
latter is in all its uses accordant with datives) are those in which the
imperative value is most distinctly to be recognized.

e\. In the Brāhmaṇas and Sūtras (especially in ÇB.) the dative in
`tavāi` is not seldom used with a verb signifying *speak*
(`brū, vac, ah`), to express the ordering of anything to be done: thus,
`tásmād óṣadhīnām evá mū́lāny úcchettavāí brūyāt` (ÇB.) *therefore let
him direct the roots of the plants to be cut up* (*speak in order to
their cutting up*: cf. `yé vaçā́yā ádānāya vádanti` *who dissuade from
giving the cow*: AV.).

983\. The ablative infinitive — which, like the accusative, is made only
from the root-noun and that in `tu` — is found especially with the
prepositions `ā́` *until* and `purā́` *before*.

a\. Thus, `ā́ támitoḥ` (TS. etc.) *until exhaustion*;
`purā́ vācáḥ právaditoḥ` (TS.) *before utterance of the voice*. In the
Brāhmaṇa language, this is the well-nigh exclusive construction of the
ablative (it occurs also with `prāk, arvāk`, etc.); in the Veda, the
latter is used also after `ṛté` *without*, and after several verbs, as
`trā` and `pā` *protect*, `yu` *separate*, `bhī`, etc.

b\. In a few instances, by an attraction similar to that illustrated
above for the dative (982 a), a noun dependent on this infinitive is put
in the ablative beside it: thus, `purā vāgbhyaḥ sampravaditoḥ` (PB.)
*before the utterance together of the voices*;
`trā́dhvaṁ kartā́d avapádaḥ` (RV.) *save us from falling down into the
pit*; `purā dakṣiṇābhyo netoḥ` (Āpast.) *before the gifts are taken
away*.

984\. The genitive infinitive (having the same form as the ablative) is
in common use in the Brāhmaṇa language as dependent on `īçvará` *lord,
master*, employed adjectively in the sense of *capable* or *likely* or
*exposed to*.

a\. Examples are: `tā́` \[`devátāḥ`\] `īçvarā́ enam pradáhaḥ` (TS.) *they
are likely to burn him up*;
`átha ha vā́ īçvarò ‘gníṁ citvā́ kíṁcid dāuritám ā́pattor ví vā hválitoḥ`
(ÇB.) *so in truth he is liable,* *after piling the fire, to meet with
some mishap or other, or to stagger*;
`içvaraṁ vāi rathantaram udgātuç cakṣuḥ pramathitoḥ` (PB.) *the
rathantara is liable to knock out the eye of the chanter*.

b\. The dative is used in ÇB. instead of the genitive in a single phrase
(`īçvarāú jánayitavāí`); and, in the later language, sometimes the
accusative in turn. In a case or two the masc. sing. nom. `īçvaraḥ` is
used, without regard to the gender or number of the word which it
qualifies: thus, `tásye ”çvaráḥ prajā́ pā́pīyasī bhávitoḥ` (ÇB.) *his
progeny is liable to deteriorate*. And in a very few instances the word
`īçvara` is omitted, and the genitive has the same value without it:
thus, `dve madhyaṁdinam abhi pratyetoḥ` (AB.) *two may be added to the
noon libation*; `táto dīkṣitáḥ pāmanó bhávitoḥ` (ÇB.) *then the
consecrated is liable to get the itch*.

c\. This construction with `īçvara`, which is the only one for the
genitive infinitive in the Brāhmaṇa, is unknown in the Veda, where the
genitive is found in a very small number of examples with `madhyā́`, and
with the root `īç`: thus, `madhyā́ kártoḥ` (RV.) *in the midst of
action*; `ī́çe rāyó dā́toḥ` (RV.) *he is master of the giving of wealth*;
`ī́çe yótoḥ` (RV.) *is able to keep away*.

985\. Unless the infinitives in `ṣaṇi` and `tari` are locative in form
(their uses are those of datives), the locative infinitive is so rare,
and has so little that is peculiar in its use, that it is hardly worth
making any account of. An example is `uṣáso budhí` (RV.) *at the
awakening of the dawn*.

986\. In the Veda, the dative infinitive forms are very much more
numerous than the accusative (in RV., their occurrences are twelve times
as many; in AV., more than three times); and the accusative in `tum` is
rare (only four forms in RV., only eight in AV.). In the Brāhmaṇas, the
accusative has risen to much greater comparative frequency (its forms
are nearly twice as many as those of the dative); but the
ablative-genitive, which is rare in the Veda, has also come to full
equality with it. The disappearance in the classical language of all
excepting the accusative in `tum` (but see 968 h) is a matter for no
small surprise.

987\. The later infinitive in tum is oftenest used in constructions
corresponding to those of the earlier accusative: thus,
`na vāṣpam açakat soḍhurn` *he could not restrain his tears*;
`taṁ draṣṭum arhasi` *thou oughtest to see it*; `prāptum icchanti` *they
desire to obtain*; `saṁkhyātum ārabdham` *having begun to count*. But
also, not infrequently, in those of the other cases. So, especially, of
the dative: thus, `avasthātuṁ sthānāntaraṁ cintaya` *devise another
place to stay in*; `tvām anveṣṭum ihā ”gataḥ` *he has come hither to
seek for thee*; — but likewise of the genitive: thus, `samartho gantum`
*capable of going*; `saṁdhātum īçvaraḥ` *able to mend*. Even a
construction as nominative is not unknown: thus, `yuktaṁ tasya mayā `
`samāçvāsayitum bhāryām` (MBh.) *it is proper for me to comfort his
wife*; `na naptāraṁ svayaṁ nyāyyaṁ çaptum evam` (R.) *it is not suitable
thus to curse one's own grandson*; `tad vaktuṁ na pāryate` (Çatr.) *it
is not possible to say that*.

988\. In the later language, as in the earlier, the infinitive in
certain connections has what we look upon as a passive value. Thus,
`kartum ārabdhaḥ` *begun to be made*; `çrotuṁ na yujyate` *it is not fit
to be heard* (*for hearing*). This is especially frequent along with the
passive forms of √`çak`: thus, `tyaktuṁ na çakyate` *it cannot be
abandoned*; `çakyāv ihā ”netum` *they two can be brought hither*;
`na ca vibhūtayaḥ çakyam avāptum ūrjitāḥ` *nor are mighty successes a
thing capable of being attained*.

  

Gerunds.

989\. The so-called gerund is a stereotyped case (doubtless
instrumental) of a verbal noun, used generally as adjunct to the logical
subject of a clause, denoting an accompanying or (more often) a
preceding action to that signified by the verb of the clause. It has
thus the virtual value of an indeclinable participle, present or past,
qualifying the actor whose action it describes.

a\. Thus, for example: `çrutvāi ’va cā ’bruvan` *and hearing* (or
*having heard*) *they spoke*;
`tebhyaḥ pratijñāyā ’thāi ’tān paripapraccha` *having given them his
promise, he then questioned them*.

990\. The gerund is made in the later language by one of the two
suffixes त्वा `tvā` and य `ya`, the former being used with a simple
root, the latter with one that is compounded with a prepositional prefix
— or, rarely, with an element of another kind, as adverb or noun.

a\. To this distribution of uses between the two suffixes there are
occasional exceptions. Thus, gerunds in `ya` from simple roots are not
very rare in the epic language (e. g. `gṛhya, uṣya` \[√`vas` *dwell*\],
`arcya, īkṣya, cintya, tyajya, lakṣya`; also from causatives and
denominatives, as `vācya, yojya, plāvya`), and are not unknown elsewhere
(e. g. `arcya` and `īkṣya` M., `prothya` AGS., `sthāpya` ÇvU.). And
gerunds in `tvā` from compounded roots are met with in considerable
numbers from AV. (only `pratyarpayitvā́`) down: e. g. `samīrayitvā́` MS.,
`virocayitvā́` TA., `utkṣiptvā` U., `pratyuktvā` E., `pratyasitvā` S.,
`prahasitvā` MBh., `saṁdarçayitvā` MBh., `vimuktvā` R., `nivedayitvā`
R., `proktvā` Pañc., `anupītva` VBS.: the great majority of them are
made from the causative stem. 

b\. The prefixion of the negative particle, `a` or `an`, does not cause
the gerund to take the form in `ya`: thus, `akṛtvā, amīrayitvā` (but R.
has `acintya`). Of compounds with other than verbal prefixes, RV. has
`punardā́ya, karṇagṛ́hya, pādagṛ́hya, hastagṛ́hya, araṁkṛ́tya, akkhalīkṛ́tya, mithaspṛ́dhya`;
AV. has further `namaskṛ́tya`.

991\. The suffix त्वा `tvā` has the accent. It is usually added directly
to the root, hut often also with interposition of the auxiliary vowel इ
`i` — with regard to which, as well as to the form of the root before
it, the formation nearly agrees with that of the participle in त `ta`
(952 ff.).

a\. Examples of the general accordance of passive participle,
infinitive, and gerund in regard to the use of `i` were given above, 968
a; farther specifications are called for, as follows:

b\. The quotable roots in variable `ṛ` (242) change it to `īr`: thus,
`tīrtvā́, stīrtvā́` (also `stṛtvā́`); and `car` makes also `cīrtvā` (like
`cīrṇa`); — roots in `ā` show in general the same weakening as in the
participle; but from `dhā` *put* is quotable only `dhitvā́`, from `mā`
*measure* `mitvā́` and `mītvā`, from `dā` *give* only `dattvā́`, from
`chā chāyitvā`; — of roots in `am, kram` and `bhram` and `yam` make
forms both with and without `i` (as in the infinitive), but `ram` has
`ratvā́` and `raṁtvā`, and `dam` and `vam` make `damitvā` and `vamitvā`.

c\. The auxiliary vowel is taken by roots `gras, muṣ, çap`, and `çās`
(`çāsitvā`) (whose participles have both forms); also by `cāy, nṛt`
(`nartitvā`), `lag`, and `svaj` (against analogy of pple); and `çuc`
makes `çocitvā`. On the other hand, from `ruj` (`rugṇa`) and `vraçc`
(`vṛkṇa`) come `ruktvā́` and `vṛṣṭvā́`. And both forms are made (as also
in infinitive or participle) from `car, vas` *dwell* (`uṣṭvā, uṣitvā́`),
`nī` (`nītvā́, nayitvā`), and `mṛj` (`mṛṣṭvā́, mārjitvā`).

d\. While the formation is in general one requiring, like the passive
participle (e. g. `uptvā`, like `uptá`; `uditvā́`, like `uditá`), a weak
or weakened root, there are some cases in which it is made from a strong
or strengthened root-form. Thus (besides the instances already given:
`chāyitvā, raṁtvā, çāsitvā, cāyitvā, çocitvā, nayitvā, mārjitvā`), we
find `charditvā` (Āpast.), `daṅṣṭvā`, and `spharitvā`, and, from a
number of roots, a second strong form beside the more regular weak one:
namely, `an̄ktvā, bhan̄ktvā, bhun̄ktvā, syanttvā` (beside `aktvā́` etc.);
`cayitvā, smayitvā, smaritvā` (beside `citvā́` etc.); `roditvā` (beside
`ruditvā`), and `siñcitvā` (beside `siktvā`). The last shows the
influence of the present-stem; as do also `mārjitvā` (above) and
`jighritvā` (√`ghrft`). The form `ṣṭhutvā` (Āpast.) is doubtless a false
reading, for `ṣṭhyūtvā`.

992\. The suffix य `ya` is added directly to the root, which is
accented, but has its weak form. A root ending in a short vowel takes
त्य `tya` instead of य `ya`: thus, जित्य -`jítya`, स्तुत्य -`stútya`,
कृत्य -`kṛ́tya`.

a\. Roots in variable `ṛ` (242) change that vowel to `īr` or `ūr`: thus,
`kīrya, gī́rya, tīrya` (and `tū́rya`), `dī́rya, pūrya, çī́rya, stī́rya` (also
`stṛtya`); — roots in `ā` have for the most part -`āya`; but `dhā`
*suck* makes `dhīya`, and double forms are found from `gā` *sing*
(`gāya, gī́ya`), `pā` *drink* (`pā́ya, pīya`), `dā` *give*
(`dā́ya, dádya`), `dā` *divide* (`dā́ya, ditya`), `mā` *measure, exchange*
(`mā́ya, mítya`), `sā` *bind* (`sā́ya, sya`); `lī` *cling* has `lā́ya` or
`līya`, as if an `ā`-verb; and `khan` and `dham` make `khāya` and
`dhmā́ya`, from their `ā`-forms; — the roots in `an` and `am` making
their participle in `ata` (954 d) make the gerund in `atya`, but also
later in `anya, amya` (e. g. `gátya, gamya; hátya, hanya`; but `tan`
makes as second form `tāya`, and from `ram` only `ramya` is quotable); —
the roots in `īv` add `ya` to their `īv`-form: thus, `ṣṭhīvya, sī́vya`; —
a few roots in `i` and `u` add `ya` to the lengthened vowel besides
adding `tya`: thus, `i` *go* (`īya, ítya`; also `ayya`), `ci` *gather*
(`cīya, cítya`), and `plu, yu` *unite*, `su, stu` (`plū́ya, plutya`,
etc.); while `kṣi` *destroy* has only `kṣī́ya`.

b\. This gerund, though accented on the root-syllable, is generally a
weakening formation: thus are made, without a strengthening nasal found
in some other forms,
`ácya, ájya, idhya, údya, ubhya, grathya, tácya, daçya, bádhya, bhajya, lípya, lúpya, vlágya, çrabhya, sajya, skábhya, stábhya, syadya, svajya`;
with weakening of other kinds, `gṛ́hya` and `gṛ́bhya`,
`pṛcchya, úcya, udya, úpya, úṣya` (`vas` *dwell*),
`úhya, vidhya, vī́ya, vṛçcya, spṛ́dhya, hū́ya`; — but from a number of
roots are made both a stronger and a weaker form: thus, `manthya` and
`máthya, mārjya` and `mṛ́jya, rundhya` and `rúdhya, çaṅsya` and
`çásya, çāsya` and `çiṣya, skándya` and `skádya, sráṅsya` and `srasya`;
— and only strong forms are found from roots `arc, av, cāy, çī`
(`çayya`), as well as from certain roots with a constant nasal: e. g.
`uñch, kamp, nand, lamb, çan̄k`; isolated cases are `oṣya` (√`uṣ`
*burn*), `prothya` (also `prúthya`).

c\. Other special cases are `úhya` and `ūhya` (√`ūh` *remove*), `gurya`
and `gū́rya, gúhya` and `gūhya, rúhya` and `rūhya, bhramya` and
`bhrāmya, áyya` (beside `ítya, īya`), `ghrāya` and `jighrya`; and
`ūrṇutya` (beside `vṛ́tya`).

993\. The older language has the same two gerund formations, having the
same distinction, and used in the same way.

a\. In RV., however, the final of `ya` is in the great majority of
instances (fully two thirds) long (as if the instrumental ending of a
derivative noun in `i` or `ti`). In AV., long `ā` appears only once in a
RV. passage.

b\. Instead of `tvā` alone, the Veda has three forms of the suffix,
namely `tvā́, tvā́ya`, and `tvī́`. Of these three, `tvī́` is decidedly the
commonest in RV. (thirty-five occurrences, against twenty-one of `tvā`);
but it is unknown in AV., and very rare elsewhere in the older
language; `tvā́ya` is found nine times in RV. (only once outside the
tenth Book), twice in AV., and but half-a-dozen times elsewhere (in ÇB.,
once from a causative stem: `spāçayitvā́ya`). The historical relation of
the three forms is obscure.

c\. Two other gerund suffixes, `tvānam` and `tvīnam`. are mentioned by
the grammarians as of Vedic use, but they have nowhere been found to
occur.

994\. The use of this gerund, though not changing in its character,
becomes much more frequent, and even excessive, in the later language.

a\. Thus, in the Nala and Bhagavad-Gītā, which have only one tenth as
many verb-forms as RV., there are more than three times as many examples
of the gerund as in the latter.

b\. In general, the gerund is an adjunct to the subject of a sentence,
and expresses an act or condition belonging to the subject: thus,
`vajreṇa hatvā́ nír apáḥ sasarja` (RV.) *smiting with his thunderbolt, he
poured forth the waters*; `pītvī́ sómasya vāvṛdhe` (RV.) *having drunk of
the soma, he waxed strong*;
`tē yajñásya rásaṁ dhītvā́ vidúhya yajñáṁ yūpéna yopayitvā́ tirò ‘bhavan`
(ÇB.) *having sucked out the sap of the offering, having milked the
offering dry, having blocked it with the sacrificial post, they
disappeared*; `çrutvāi ’va cā ’bruvan` (MBh.) *and having heard, they
said*; `taṁ ca dūre dṛṣṭvā gardabhī ’yam iti matvā dhāvitaḥ` (H.) *and
having seen him in the distance, thinking 'it is a she-ass', he ran*.

c\. But if the logical subject, the real agent, is put by the
construction of the sentence in a dependent case, it is still qualified
by the gerund: thus, `stríyaṁ dṛṣṭvā́ya kitaváṁ tatāpa` (RV.) *it
distresses the gambler* (i. e. *the gambler is distressed*) *at seeing a
woman*; `táṁ hāi ’naṁ dṛṣṭvā́ bhī́r viveda` (ÇB.) *fear came upon him* (i.
e. *he was afraid*) *when he saw him*; `vidhāya proṣite vṛttim` (M.)
*when he stays away after providing for her support*;
`kiṁ nu me syād idaṁ kṛtvā` (MBh.) *what, I wonder, would happen to me
if I did this*; — and especially, when a passive form is given to the
sentence, the gerund qualifies the agent in the instrumental case (282
a): thus, `tataḥ çabdād abhijñāya sa vyāghreṇa hataḥ` (H.) *thereupon he
was slain by the tiger, who recognized him by his voice*;
`tvayā sa rājā çakuntalām puraskṛtya vaktavyaḥ` (Ç.) *presenting
Çakuntalā, thou must say to the king*;
`haṅsānāṁ vacanaṁ çrutvā yathā me` (gen. for instr.) `nāiṣadho vṛtaḥ`
(MBh.) *as the Nishadhan was chosen by me on hearing the words of the
swans*: this construction is extremely common in much of the later
Sanskrit.

d\. Occasionally, the gerund qualifies an agent, especially an
indefinite one, that is unexpressed: thus,
`tadā ’trāi ’va paktvā khāditavyaḥ` (H.) *then he shall be eaten \[by
us\] cooking him on the spot*;
`yad anyasya parijñāya punar anyasya dīyate` (M.) *that, after being
promised* (lit. *when one has promised her*) *to one, she is given again
to another*; `sucintya co ’ktaṁ suvicārya yat kṛtam` (H.) *what one says
after mature thought,* *and does after full deliberation*. Hence, still
more elliptically, after `alam`: thus, `alaṁ vicārya` (Ç.) *enough of
hesitation*; `tad alaṁ te vanaṁ gatvā` (R.) *so have done with going to
the forest*.

e\. Other less regular constructions are met with, especially in the
older language: thus, in the manner of a participle with `man` and the
like (268 a), as `táṁ hiṅsitvè ’va mene` (ÇB.) *he thought he had hurt
him*; `tā adbhir abhiṣicya nijāsyāi ’vā ’manyata` (AB.) *having
sprinkled them with water, he believed himself to have exhausted them*;
— in the manner of a participle forming a continuous tense with √`i`
(1075 a), as `indram evāi ’tāir ārabhya yanti` (AB.) *by means of them
they keep taking hold of Indra*; — as qualifying a subordinate member of
the sentence, as `puroḍā́çam evá kūrmám bhūtvā́ sárpantam` (ÇB.) *to the
sacrificial cake creeping about, having become a tortoise*;
`ayodhyām . . . saphenām sasvanām bhūtvā jalormim iva` (R.) *into
Ayodhyā, like a surge that had been foamy and roaring*; — even
absolutely, as `ātithyéna vāí devā́ iṣṭvā́ tā́nt samád avindat` (ÇB.) *when
the gods had sacrificed with the guest-offering, strife befel them*.

f\. As in the two examples before the last, a predicate word with
`bhūtvā` is put in the same case with the subject: thus, further,
`tád iyám evāì ’tád bhūtvā́ yajati` (ÇB.) *so having thus become this
earth he makes offering*; `yena vāmanenā ’pi bhūtvā` (Vet.) *by whom,
even when he had become a dwarf*. The construction is a rare one.

g\. A number of gerunds have their meaning attenuated sometimes to the
semblance of a preposition or adverb: such are `adhikṛtya` *making a
subject of*, i. e. *respecting, of*; `ādāya, upāgṛhya` *taking*, i. e.
*with*; `uddiçya` *pointing toward*, i. e. *at*; `āsādya,` *arriving
at*, i. e. *along, by*; `ārabhya` *beginning*, i.e. *from*; `sambhūya`
*being with*, i. e. *with*; `saṁhatya` *striking together*, i. e. *in
unison*; `prasahya` *using force*, i. e. *violently*;
`tyaktvā, parityajya, muktvā, vihāya, uddhṛtya, varjayitvā` *leaving
out* etc., i. e. *excepting, without*; and others. Examples are:
`çakuntalām adhikṛtya bravīmi` (Ç.) *I am speaking of Çakuntalā*;
`tam uddiçya kṣiptalaguḍaḥ` (H.) *having thrown the cudgel at him*;
`nimittaṁ kiṁcid āsādya` (H.) *for some reason or other*.

h\. The gerund is in the later language sometimes found in composition,
as if a noun-stem: e. g. `prasahyaharaṇa` *taking with violence*;
`pretyabhāva` *existence after death*; `vibhajyapāṭha` *separate
enunciation*; `sambhūyagamana` *going together*. It is also often
repeated (1260), in a distributive sense: e. g.
`sá vāí sammṛ́jya-sammṛjya pratápya-pratapya prá yacchati` (ÇB.) *in each
case, after wiping and warming them, he hands them over*;
`gṛhītvā-gṛhītvā` (KÇS.) *at each taking*; `unnamyo’nnamya` (Pañc.)
*every time that they arise*.

Adverbial Gerund in `am`.

995\. The accusative of a derivative *nomen actionis* in `a`, used
adverbially, assumes sometimes a value and construction so accordant
with that of the usual gerund that it cannot well be called by a
different name.

a\. No example of a peculiar gerundial construction with such a form
occurs either in RV. or AV., although a dozen adverbial accusatives are
to be classed as representing the formation: thus,
`abhyākrā́mam, pratán̄kam, praṇódam, nilā́yam, abhiskándam`, etc. This
gerund is found especially in the Brāhmaṇas and Sūtras, where it is not
rare; in the epics it is extremely infrequent; later, also, it occurs
very sparingly.

b\. A final vowel has vṛddhi-strengthening before the suffix: thus,
`nāyam, çrāvam, kāram`; final `ā` adds `y`: thus, `khyāyam, yāyam`; a
medial vowel has `guṇa` (if capable of it: 240): thus,
`kṣepam, kroçam, vartam` (but `īkṣam, pūram`); a medial `a` before a
single consonant is lengthened: thus, `krāmam, cāram, grāham, svādam`
(but `grantham, lambham`). The accent is on the radical syllable. No
uncompounded examples are found in the older language, and extremely few
in the later.

c\. Examples are: `kā́maṁ vā́ imā́ny án̄gāni vyatyā́saṁ çete` (ÇB.) *he lies
changing the position of these limbs at pleasure*;
`úttarām-uttarāṁ çā́khāṁ samālámbhaṁ róhet` (ÇB.) *he would climb, taking
hold of a higher and ever a higher limb*;
`aparī́ṣu mahānāgám ivā ’bhisaṁsā́raṁ didṛkṣitā́raḥ` (ÇB.) *hereafter,
running together as it were about a great snake, they will wish to see
him*; `nā́māny āsām etā́ni nāmagrā́ham` (ÇB.) *with separate naming of
these their names*; `yó viparyā́sam avagū́hati` (ÇB.) *whoever buries it
upside down*; `bāhūtkṣepaṁ kranditum pravṛttā` (Ç.) *she proceeded to
cry, throwing up her arms* (*with arm-tossing*);
`navacūtapallavāni darçaṁ-darçam madhukarāṇāṁ kvanitāni çrāvaṁ-çrāvam paribabhrāma`
(DKC.) *he wandered about, constantly seeing the young shoots of the
mango, and hearing the humming of the bees*. Repeated forms, like those
in the last example, are approved in the later language; they do not
occur earlier (but instead of them the repeated ordinary gerund: 994 h).
