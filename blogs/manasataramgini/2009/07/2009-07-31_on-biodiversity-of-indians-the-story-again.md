*A principle component analysis using a panel of 93 ancestry informative
SNPs. Modified from :BMC Genetics 2009, Nassir et al. It shows how with
these markers one can distinguish races such as African, Western
Eurasian, Eastern Eurasian, Oceanian and Native American. But Indian are
difficult to separate from Western Eurasians.*

The leukosphere and its sepoys headed by the subversionists of madhyama
mlechCha-desha of krau\~nchadvIpa have been consistently trying to erase
the identity of Hindus by foisting upon us such despicable
identity-masking descriptors such “South Asia”. Yet the Hindu people
comprise about a 6th of our species. Their genetics, linguistics and
prehistory have been intensely studied, yet there remain many lacunae in
our understanding of their origins. As of 2009 CE more than a decade of
molecular studies has been completed on the Indian genomes. We shall
briefly look at these findings to see if they can be reconciled with
linguistic and archaeological data.

The genetic affinities of Indians as currently understood can be
succinctly presented thusly:  
1\) The Indians as a whole form a rather distinctive group of humans
that are well differentiated in genetic terms from Western (e.g.
Europeans) as well as Eastern Eurasian peoples (e.g. Chinese, Japanese
etc).  
2\) Yet, if we look at total ancestry based on the resultant signal from
biparental markers we observe the Indians to be closer to Western
Eurasian than to Eastern Eurasians.  
3\) However, if one looks at uni-parental markers we see the following
pattern:  
3.1- The Y-chromosomal affinities of Indians are greater to
Western-Eurasian than Eastern Eurasians.  
3.2- The Mitochondrial DNA affinities of Indians are greater to Eastern
Eurasians than Western Eurasians.  
4\) Amongst Indians, irrespective of whether one looks at uniparental or
biparental markers, the upper castes have greater affinity to Western
Eurasians than to Eastern Eurasians. But this effect is most pronounced
for Y-chromosomal data. Amongst Indians, highest affinity to Eastern
Eurasians is seen only amongst tribals.

The cultural/linguistic situation may be summarized thusly:  
1\) The majority of Indians speak an Indo-European language of a single
subfamily (Indo-Aryan), a language family they share with a large
fraction of the Western Eurasians. Another major language family amongst
Indians is Dravidian, which is unique to India.  
2\) Majority of Indians, irrespective of the language they speak,
followed Indo-European cultural practices at least until recently and
the survival of the most archaic Indo-European traditions is only seen
in India.  
3\) Indo-Aryan as well as Dravidian shows evidence for a linguistic
substratum from which each language acquired a large number of plant,
animal and agricultural terms.

The chief archaeological issues might be summarized thusly:  
1\) India appears to have supported a microlithic hunter-gatherer
population by around 30,000 y BP.  
2\) India appears to represents a zone of early independent
domestication of various crops such as rice, millets, and certain
lentils.  
3\) Farming and animal husbandry practices appear early in the NW of the
subcontinent.  
4\) The same NW region shows a subsequent emergence of early
regionalized large scale settlements starting around 5000-4500 BCE. By
2600 BCE these regional settlements in the NW had integrated into a
massive culturally pretty uniform urban civilization – the IVC/SSVC.
This civilization flourishes rather undisturbed for about 700 years
during which some materially connected Chalcolithic civilizations appear
in the interior of the sub-continent. At its peak it spans from the
banks of the Oxus to the banks of the Godavari  
5\) Starting around 1900 BCE to around 1000 BCE the IVC sites in the NW
declined and the population moved carrying aspects of the culture to the
Ganga-Yamuna Doab and into Gujarat. Eventually the urbanization
considerably declined or vanished until a second vigorous urbanization
around 600 BCE.

If viewed at this level of granularity a relatively consistent picture
can be constructed. Both genetics and linguistics point to an intimate
connection between the Indian people and Western Eurasians rather than
with Eastern Eurasians, except of the mitochondrial DNA. Both Neolithic
and chalcolithic developments on the Indian subcontinent begin in the
Northwest of the subcontinent and spread inwards. Taken together these
observations imply that there has been a flux of people from the NW in
waves who have notably contributed to both the linguistic and cultural
affinities of modern Indians. This flux appears to have been either male
dominated or the incumbent males from NW practiced hypergyny with the
native females belonging to an older population closer to the modern
Eastern Eurasians. The correlation between caste hierarchy and the
genetic affinities to western Eurasians strongly supports that the idea
the carriers of the Indo-Aryan language were a major component of this
human wave which spread developments from the NW into the subcontinent.

But this neat picture is definitely muddied when looks at several
specifics:  
1\) The R1 lineages are major Y-chromosomal haplotypes shared between
Indians and western Eurasians. However, the studies on the diversity of
the R1 lineages seem to suggest that their diversity is greatest in
India. This at face value would suggest an efflux rather than influx
from Western Eurasia. However, the reality may be more complex –
involving a very early (pre-Indo-European efflux) followed by an influx
of Indo-Aryan.  
2\) The IVC shows few signals that are compatible with it being
Indo-Aryan e.g. rarity of depictions of horses which are central animals
in the earliest Indo-Aryan text the R^igveda. At the same time there is
no evidence for a cataclysmic end of the IVC at the hands of the
Indo-Aryans. Yet, the spread of the IVC and the linked inner
chalcolithic culture closely overlap with the historical spread of
Indo-Aryan. The age of the earliest Indo-Aryan texts, despite baseless
claims of white Indologists to the contrary, cannot be placed after the
core IVC period. This IVC vs Indo-Aryan discordance remains a major
problem in Indian history.  
3\) The IVC graffiti continues to confuse – is it a script or not
remains unclear? Hence the corollary, namely the IVC language remains
intractable. So despite certain recognizable Indic features we remain in
the dark about the IVC/SSVC. I do suspect that the language X that
appears as a substratum in Indo-Aryan and Dravidian might indeed be the
original IVC but at some point it underwent a conversion to Indo-Aryan.
When this happened remains entirely intractable yet.  
So we may call the glass either half-full or half-empty – a personal
choice. But in practical terms, we find Indian researchers exhibiting
enormous intellectual insufficiency in handling these problems:
Archaeologists display misunderstanding of comparative linguistics and
textual studies. Linguists are non-existent or display a fundamental
lack of understanding of the texts from which they get their languages.
Biologists show a lack of understanding of texts, linguistics and
culture. Add mlechCha-s with agendas and the dead weight of conformity
to this mix and the result is fog.
