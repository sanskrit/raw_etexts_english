## CCXXII

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
DIST. HOWRAH,

*15th May 1902*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINE,

So glad to learn you like Mayavati. The heat here has come in earnest,
and no rain. I drink very little water though.

I have given up all idea of going to Mayavati or Almora. I bear the heat
well, but the rains here are to be avoided. I will remove \[myself\] to
somewhere else then.

No news from Calcutta. I am in a hurry. Write me the details of whatever
you see or feel there — about men and things.

Yours with all love,  
VIVEKANANDA.
