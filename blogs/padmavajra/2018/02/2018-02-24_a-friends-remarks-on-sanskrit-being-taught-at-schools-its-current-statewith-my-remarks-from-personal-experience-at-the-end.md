From personal experience,having learned Sanskrit from classes VI to
X(including both the classes),you basically get the level of a sloppy
version of just only the [vākya vyavahāra book of the first
level](http://www.navelgazing.net/2013/11/sanskrit-svadhyaya-teach-yourself.html)(as
taught by Sri Vempati Kutumba Shastri) and that itself will get you more
than 90% in the Sanskrit CBSE exam of class X. And that too will get
lost/eroded to nothing within a year of non practice. This is the state
of Sanskrit teaching as I have seen and experienced it. If you want
people to actually like and respect Sanskrit at schools,the methodology
must change a lot.
