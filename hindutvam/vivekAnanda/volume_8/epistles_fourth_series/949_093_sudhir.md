## XCIII

ALMORA,  
*20th May, 1897*.

DEAR SUDHIR,

Your letter gave me much pleasure. One thing, perhaps, I forget to tell
you — to keep a copy of the letter you sent me. Also all important
communications to the Math from different persons and to different
persons should be copied and preserved.

I am very glad to learn that things are going on well, that the work
there is steadily progressing as well as that of Calcutta.

I am all right now except for the fatigue of the travel which I am sure
will go off in a few days.

My love and blessings to you all.

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.
