Among the old inscriptions of the vinAyaka temples in the far-East are
the following  
1\) The Angkor Borei inscription of 611 AD, which mentions the
construction of a shrine to mahAgaNapati.  
2\) 660 AD the jayavarman II inscription describing a temple built to
shrIgaNapati.  
3\) 817 AD inscription at Po Nagar in Vietnam of harivarman, the Champa
King mentioning the temple built to shrI gaNapati (vinAyaka).  
4\) 890 AD inscription of yashovarman I mentioning the building of two
tantric Ashramas for the worship of vinAyaka known as chandanAdri
gaNesha (sandal mountain gaNesha).

The most mysterious inscription is from Prasat Prei Kuk shrine in
Cambodia to vinAyaka built by king ishAnavarman I.

The chief of the dAnavas capturing others territory was conquered by the
might of another

bound with chains after having fallen here for a long time shut up in
the mountain praises him

tan dR^iShTvA kinnarAbhish shatagaNasahitas svapnashoShe himAdrer  
Having seen that, with a 100 gaNas and kinnaras, having woken up, from
the Himalayan peak,

AyAto mokShanArthA\~N jayati gaNapatis tvad-dhitAyeva so yaM  
comes this gaNapati who for your welfare conquers for the purpose of
liberating.

I wonder what mythological tale this alludes to ? May theÂ terrible
gaNapa be pacified
