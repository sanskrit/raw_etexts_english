<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Devotee-Raghunath</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Krishnachandra Mahapatra was a very rich landlord. He was not at all short of elephants, horses, servants-maid-servants. His guest-house remained always full of the blissful voice of the guest-visitors. His ideal wife, Kamala was very generous and chaste one. Kamala was endowed with plenty of virtues and beauty like Goddess Kamala incarnate. By the grace of God, he had a virtuous son, named Raghunath. Raghunath’s nature was polite and humble from the very childhood, he was sweet with everyone in talk, all remained satisfied and pleased with his behaviour. Going to the temple again and again Raghunath bowed before the idol of God; sang congregational song, did eulogy and took the round.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the age of seventeen his parents married him to Annapurna, the daughter of the well-off man, Gangadhar Karan of the village, Kalawatipur. Annapurna was the only sister, youngest among seven brothers, so, all the family members had great affection and paid special regard to her. As such, the marriage ceremony was performed with great pomp and show. Getting a daughter-in-law, with good qualities and characteristics, Kamala’s heart blossomed. She began to feel heavenly pleasure.  On this period of time Kamala was happy with all the seven kinds of pleasures; but it was fated something otherwise. For a few years, famine broke out continuously. Krishnachandra was a kind-hearted man, he did stop charging the land revenue, side by side, he offered whatever he had, in the service of the starving farmers. The house became empty. When a man begins to spend to maintain the family prestige and status once, in the miserable condition also he hesitates to spend less than earlier. The same was the condition of <span class="char-style-override-7">k</span>rishnachandra, he did not think to cut the coat according to clothes, his expenses continued as usual. He became indebted. The constant worries caused a great loss to <span class="char-style-override-7">k</span>rishnachandra’s health, he fell ill and one day, considering himself lying on death-bed, he called his dear son, Raghunath to him and placing his head in his lap began to say in pathetic tone—‘My dearest son! I just depart but keep my one single wish in your mind. Pay off the maximum debt to the best of your capacity. Remain cautious that the feeling of deceiving anyone may not crop up in your mind. God will bless you. Having said this much Krishnachandra closed his eyes forever. Whose husband was her life such Kamala burnt herself on the funeral pyre of her husband willingly having taken leave from her son. It was like a thunderbolt on the head of Raghunath.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जाही बिधि राखे राम ताही बिधि रहिये।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Live according to the will of the God.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Annapurna was the daughter of a very rich family, She lived mostly at her maternal house. Her father and brother had abundance of riches; but they were very miser. That is why they paid no heed even to the news of Raghunath’s miserable condition. What is the use of miser’s money? Those who are the insects of money, remain always busy in amassing and guarding money. They bear even the miserable grief of their dear son, daughter and venerable mother and father making their heart of stone; but they don’t want to part with even a single paisa for them. Raghunath was also not a common child; he was acquainted with such a man whose comparison, if made with his father-in-law Gangadhar Karan, was not even equal to a glow worm before the Sun. Raghunath did not go to his father-in-law’s house to seek any support. He sold whatever he had and paid off the whole debt owed by his father. Having made the arrangement of regular God-worship, he set out from the house wearing a small loin cloth and with a tattered cover cloth.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is the frolicsome activity of the Lord. There were blossoming two flowers in a single tree. In the meanwhile, it is not known wherefrom the worm of time made its abode in the root of the same. Oh! O God! The worm did not let them blossom even; They withered and fell down diffusing only a little fragrance and spreading a little glow. Now Raghunath! This is the time of your flourish, Flourish yourself, you are the devotee of the God—you are the flower of the lotus-type; You will have to open your petals and blossom, in the mighty heat of the Sun of misery and poverty, flourish yourself. Your splendour will be added hundred times more from this torn filthy clothes like the lotus covered with moss—the entire universe will be scented with the fragrance of your devotion. Now, the proper days for you to blossom have arrived, blossom Raghunath! You flourish!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Raghunath began to pass his days begging from village to village. This boy belongs to a high family, he was quite unaware of what is called sorrow. But today his agony or sorrow has no bounds. One day, in the dense night, lying under a tree, Raghunath thought to himself—what is gain in wandering about from village to village in this way without any purpose? What is the usefulness of life only passing the days in eating and sleeping like an animal? Why not to pass the life staying in any holy place muttering the name of the Lord—It will be better.’ Thinking so and concluding accordingly, Raghunath went away to Nilachal (Puri) with the reverence of devotion and love in his heart. After going into the temple and viewing the sight of the Lord he began to say with folded hands in a very simple way—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Lord! I am deprived of my mother and father both—they have left me as an orphan. That is why Raghu is today ‘unprotected—means unsupported.’ My mind goads me to take the shelter at your feet. But what is the meaning of my will, O my Lord! It is your will that counts.’ Now, do what you like but mind it that Raghunath is your bought slave.’ Whence there is the true piteous call of the heart with the conviction of simplicity; the answer is possible only there. Raghunath saw with his inner eyes as if the Lord were saying raising His lotus hands—‘Raghu! You have no fear at all, stay here delightfully enjoying your meal of the propitiatory offering, I have accepted you as my subservient.’ Respecting the Lord’s command Raghu began to stay there. Wherever offering available, to appease his hunger there and to remain viewing the sight of the Lord’s lotus face, this was the sole work of Raghunath. By the grace of the Lord Raghunath’s heart was so much overjoyed that all the past occurrences were washed away from his memory even the memory of his wife, Annapurna’s ever blooming lotus face vanished from his mind. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After some days this news reached his father-in-law’s house. To accept a poor beggar as son-in-law will damage their status and prestige. So, Gangadhar put a proposal before his sons after chiding and babbling that ‘Annapurna should be remarried considering as if Annapurna was unmarried.’ As were the qualities of father so were his sons and wife also. All unanimously approved it. Immoral, miser Gangadhar and his sons began to search out and at last, the relation was settled with the royal minister’s son, Vasu Mahapatra. Vasu was a great wicked and vicious, that is why, he agreed to marry already married Annapurna. Gangadhar and the minister’s son both were rich and influential men. So, none could dare to oppose this injustice. The date of marriage was fixed on the fifth day of the moonlit fortnight of Falgun (February-March). </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Annapurna came to know this. Now, she is not merely an innocent child. She has grown up more than fifteen years old. She became restless to know the mind of her parents; but what is the solution? Thinking of God she began to say—‘O God! What is going to happen, despite my lord of heart remaining alive, how is this talk of my second marriage? O Lord! Now, I have no right on this body, I have already surrendered myself to his feet, then how will I see the face of someone else with these eyes? O the Lord of the universe! You had rescued the elephant king from the disaster, it is You who had saved the shame of Draupadi. You are omniscient. What to say to You, the tale of my sorrow is not hidden to You. Lord! I am chaste, not corrupt; O Lord! Rescue me from this  sea of misery.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sitting aloof, Annapurna used to pray to God day and night and used to shed tears. Eating-drinking, laughing-talking, nothing was pleasant to her. She passed sleepless nights. She had lost her interest to go anywhere or to talk to anyone. In the house there was an old maidservant, who had brought up Annapurna. So, one day she related her painful story to her and said—‘Search out anyone going to visit Nilachal, let me send a letter to my lord. I am certain that he will come and protect me from this misery after receiving my letter.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The maidservant came to know one day that a few men were going to Nilachal to get the sight of Shri Jagannathji; she at once informed Annapurna and Annapurna wrote a letter—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O the lord of my heart! I am the slave of your feet, pay your attention to my misery—‘My wedding has been settled with the son of the minister of this kingdom on fifth day of the moonlit fortnight of the coming February. If I, your slave, deserve your grace, please come at once without any delay. It certainly depends on your wish whether you come or not. But I am counting the days. I will be waiting for you till the appointed time, If you fail to reach by then, I will commit suicide and give up this life.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Handing over the letter to the maidservant, Annapurna said—‘Ma! Handing over this letter convey them my message with folded hands that my lord lives at Puri, appeases his appetite by begging, he is known there by the name, ‘Raghu Arakshit. Convey my urge to them that my life depends fully on their mercy; if you give this letter to my husband, I will remain indebted to you for crores of births.’ The maid handed over the letter to them and related the whole matter meekly. They had also full sympathy with the anguish of Annapurna; so receiving the letter they assured with full confidence and set out for Puri. In the last of January (Magh) they reached Puri. For many days, they were unable to trace out Raghu. One day, abruptly, they happened to meet Raghu at the main gate of the temple. Being acquainted with him, they handed over the letter to him. Just reading the letter, Raghu’s mind happened to be restless and disturbed; he began to think—‘<span class="char-style-override-7">t</span>here are only ten days remaining to the fifth day of the moonlit fortnight of February, it takes one month to cover the distance of <span class="char-style-override-7">k</span>alawatipur. If I don’t reach, the chaste woman will commit suicide. Then, how to reach? Raghu was in a fix to come to decision. At last, going to the shelter of the Lord he began to say—‘O Lord! Who is there except You to save from this misery? O the Lord Krishna! O wish-yielding tree! O compassionate Lord, O Sun! Destroyer of darkness of misery. Find out some way to destroy the mental agony of the chaste. O the Omniscient! Nothing is hidden to you; except you, none else is protector at this time. Thus, being piteous and afflicted, it is not known, how many words Raghunath spoke before the God. It was too late in the night, with inflicted heart, praying to the Lord he fell asleep on the torn sack cloth near the main gate of the temple. Just while meditating, the affectionate to the shelter seeking, the Lord, the sleep overpowered him. He who calls the Lord considering himself meek and helpless in the aggrieved tone, is heard by the Lord at once. Today, Lord Jagannath got afflicted with the grief of His devotee. At the very moment in the same sleeping position Raghu reached Kalawatipur at the gate of Gangadhar Karan by the power of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nowadays, the people argue that this is all merely an imagination of mind. Such types of unnatural occurrences can never be possible. So, all this is beyond belief; but they are mistaken. The matters pertaining to the Lord and His true devotees are ought to be transcendental is unworldly. As His incarnation in the form from formless, similarily His actions are also divine. The Lord, Himself, has said to Arjun also—<span class="char-style-override-8">‘जन्म कर्म च मे दिव्यम्’</span> ‘My birth and action both are supernatural.’ Those who are the true devotees of God, become supernatural in their actions with the power blessed by the Lord. So, people having faith, should not have the least doubt in the supernatural deeds of the Lord and His true devotees.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just while at the Sun-rise he got up. He was bewildered to see the strange and began to think—‘Where  have I come? This is not the main gate? Nothing of Puri is visible here. Isn’t it that I am dreaming? What city is this? Whose grand palace is this in front? Here, there is no acquaintance of mine.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After marriage Raghunath had never come here. So, he could not recognise that it was his in-law’s house. When the sun rose up, he asked the passers by, ‘Brother! What is the name of this city? Who is that rich man whose building is this? ‘The people said—‘The name of this city is <span class="char-style-override-7">k</span>alawatipur and this palace belongs to Shri Gangadhar Karan.’ Just hearing the name Raghu’s amazement was beyond limit, he absorbed himself in the Lord’s love and devotion. The very moment; the stream of the tears of love began to flow from his eyes. He said to himself—‘O the auspicious and graceful Lord! Who else except You, can do this magic? Feeling pity at my heart-touching anguish it is You to show this great mercy on me. What does it matter for You? What is the meaning of this trifling matter for Him whose mere resolve creates and destroys the whole universe?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Forgetting his own identity what Raghunath was speaking to God is not known but in the mean time his many brother-in-laws came out of the house. From a distance they recognised Raghunath and conveyed this news inside the house at once going back. All became confused. Coming out when they saw, they found that it was Raghunath in torn clothes. The faces of all the family members got withered, they said to their self—wherefrom has this new problem been created? But Annapurna felt excessively happy; she began to express thousands of gratitude to the God. Whatever might be but Gangadhar took away his son-in-law inside the house due to public shame. Having got him bathed he was provided with good garments. The meal was prepared. Offering the food to the God, Raghunath took his meal. <span class="char-style-override-8">‘बिषरस भरा कनक घट जैसे’</span><span class="char-style-override-9"> </span>‘A golden pot full of poison’. According to this proverb the father-in-law, mother-in-law and the brother-in-laws of Raghunath began to talk in feigned sweet words having hidden the poison of hostility in their hearts. Nothing was left in the warm reception of Raghunath outwardly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After lunch they went away requesting Raghunath to rest. Raghunath reposed on the soft white bed like foam of the milk. The chaste Annapurna bowing down her face with shyness and modesty came slowly and slowly and sat down towards his feet and began to press his legs with her delicate hands. So many unknown emotions came to her mind to express but no word could come out of her tongue and her feelings remained folded in her mind. Just the same condition was of Raghunath also, he, too, could express nothing before Annapurna. Then, whether had they no talk at all? Why not, they did talk but in the language of tears of their eyes. The river of love overflowed from the eyes of the both without winking—both the afflicted hearts became cool.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here, wherein the silence, the tears were singing in the sweet and melodious unexpressed tune, the meeting of the two hearts of the couple, on the other side demoniac-hearted Gangadhar and his family members together were plotting for the perpetual separation of the couple. In the corner of a secret room, Gangadhar, his wife and all his seven sons unanimously decided—‘Today, in the night, Raghunath will have to be killed by giving him poison. There is no worry for Annapurna. After the death of Raghunath she will not remain orphan. Her joys will have no bounds after her wedding with the minister’s son.’ O the fools! How can you presume the joy and sorrow of a sacred and chaste-hearted woman?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As was the consent so was the action. The conspirators got the poison brought very secretly. It was decided to mix the poison in the food. The evening fell in. The food was going to be prepared. The sinful wife of Gangadhar mixed poison in all the items of food. The whispering among the mother, father and brothers of the whole day created doubt in the mind of Annapurna. She entered the kitchen on the pretext of mother’s help. The wicked mother said—‘Daughter! Will the food not be cooked without your help even today when after a long time the son-in-law has visited this house? Go and serve him. In spite of mother’s repeated instruction, Annapurna stayed there to know the secret pretending to say ‘Just, I go.’ In a very short time she smelt the entire matter. Her heart trembled with this mean thought of her parents. She at once decided to go to her husband and make him cautious. She rushed up but Gangadhar’s sons had taken away Raghunath outside for a walk. Annapurna’s mental agony was boundless not to get her husband there. She was worried excessively how to protect the husband’s life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The God provided her sense. On the small piece of toddy tree-leaf she wrote—<span class="char-style-override-8">‘भोजनमें बिष भरा हलाहल भूलचूक मुख कौर न लीजै॥’</span><span class="char-style-override-9"> </span>‘The food is poisonous, even by mistake don’t eat it’ and she went to the kitchen with this at once. The mother said—‘Anna! Stay for a while here,—I just go to adjoining room to keep the items of meal because there in that room is the arrangement to feed the son-in-law.’ Annapurna just wanted so, by the God’s grace, she got an opportunity. She silently put that piece of toddy-leaf in a ‘Pishthak’ (a type of Bengali sweet). Annapurna had seen in her husband’s house earlier that her husband was fond of Pishthak, so he would possibly first taste the Pishthak.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sinful lady called in the son-in-law placing the meal in the golden plate to serve him. Despite the intention in mind to kill him, there was no lack in her outward respectful treatment. Raghunath was quite unaware of this conspiracy. Washing his hands and feet he sat down on the seat and in the pleasing mood he offered the entire dish to Shri Jagannathji first; then after he sipped a little water. Annapurna hiding herself, was watching it from some distance, the throbbing of her heart had increased so much that she was feeling unable to stand even; but she remained there standing with the sense of duty, the darkness was spreading before her eye-sight. She was thinking if he took any other item of food first in place of Pishthak, it would be a great disaster. Then, again she thought whatever might happen but why to shame and fear? Let me see what happens; why not to call loudly and make the husband cautious that ‘the food served to him is full of poison.’ he should not touch it to his tongue at all.’ The God’s sport is strange. Annapurna had not to worry long. After sipping the water Raghunath first took up that Pishthak to taste. Just while breaking the Pishthak that toddy leaf came to his hands. Who would care for the leaf without any doubt? Raghunath and Annapurna saw it. Reading it, Raghunath at once, came to know the whole conspiracy. Considering the beginning of the dinner, the mother removed Annapurna from there very cunningly. She said—‘Daughter Anna! Go and sit with the maid; I will call you just now.’ She had fear in her mind that if she was there any other problem might be created. Annapurna too, did not express any objection in going from there, because she was confident that when her husband had already gone through her note—he would never take that poisonous food.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Raghunath came to be in a fix; the Pishthak was still remaining in his hand. He began to contemplate—‘Oh! What was done by me, I offered the poison to the Lord! O Lord! Pardon me for the fault done unknowingly. Lord! Now, grant me wisdom, what should I do? I am helpless at present to decide anything, how to give up the sacred offering of the Lord? The death is inevitable. One who is born, has to die one day it is certain. Will I remain immortal by not partaking of the God’s offering? If death is certain, what is the problem if I die today accepting the offering of God? No, no my Lord! I cannot disrespect Your offering. Whether I die or remain alive, I have no care for my life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The pious thoughts of a simple devotee reached the Lord’s ears at once. Before this at several times, God has converted the poison into nectar. The poison had proved nectar for Prahlad. There was a day when the poison to Mira had also proved nectar for her. Today also some proper arrangement would be made. Admirable is the playful Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With well understanding and without the least deviation of mind Raghunath ate the poisonous food remembering the name Lord Govind. Not a single grain was left in the plate. It was a deadly poison, it acted upon at once and after fluttering a little, he passed away. Today the witched wife of Gangadhar is feeling proud of her success and she is overjoyed. She ran to her husband and sons and called them there. All were overwhelmed with joy. All of them decided after well consideration that early in the morning the dead body would be buried in the earth. It will be announced that the sudden death was due to the snake-bite in the night. Deciding so they closed the room and went away. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Following the words of her mother, Annapurna had come apart, but her mind is not at peace, she is restless in the suspicion of any untowards occurrence. How can it be possible for a chaste woman to remain carefree after seeing the poison in her husband’s dish? Being upset, she was moving about round her sleeping room. By the movement and the whispering of mother, father and brothers created a great doubt in Annapurna’s mind. When all had gone away, she came out of her room and moved slowly and slowly towards the room where Raghunath was sitting for dinner. She found there that the room was locked. The lamp was burning inside the room. With the support of that light she peeped into the room through the window and what she saw in the room, she came in a terrific suspense. Oh! My life-support is lying lifeless on the very seat of fooding! The body of the chaste began to tremble with fear. She could stand no longer. Being fainted she fell down. When she came to sense after faint she found that it was darkness all around. Even the lamp of the room has gone out. There was pin drop silence. What was the alternative for the chaste now? She thought—<span class="char-style-override-8">‘निर्बलके बल राम हैं’</span> ‘The Lord is the strength of the weak.’ When a man becomes helpless from all sides, the mind of the afflicted man turns towards the sure and unfailing support and if he can give a call from the depth of the heart one pointedly, it is heard very soon. The sound of the kettledrum goes to four miles, the fierce roar of the thunderbolt goes to ninety-six miles but the sound of the inner heart of a devotee spreads in the whole universe and piercing through the orbit of the whole universe, reaches the divine abode of the Supreme Lord the very moment. The unspoken call of the mental agony of Annapurna exclusively devoted and depended to the Lord Hari, reached the ears of the Lord in no time. The divine throne of the Supreme God quaked with the pathetic voice of the devotee’s misery. The devotee’s mental agony made a terrible wound to the heart of the practical Lord. Realising the difficult misfortune of Raghunath, the remover of the devotee’s sorrow the Lord could not maintain His balance and reached Kalawatipur faster than the wind-speed. Annapurna standing in the dark outside suddenly heard the approaching sound of someone’s foot-step in the room. She looked inside in anxiety, she saw that the house was glittering with the smooth and bright radiance. Piercing the darkness, the gem of Ghanshyam’s lustre is spreading there. Aha! The Lord Hari is rubbing gently the body of my husband, the lord of my life with one hand, placing His other hand on his head like an affectionate mother. In the meanwhile an unprecedented sweet speech was heard. Lord Hari said—‘My dearest Raghunath! Get up my son! Why you are lying unconscious? What harm can this trivial poison affect you?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Raghunath revived to life. Raghunath got up as if from a long sleep. This blissful sight had such an impact on the mind and heart of Annapurna that she was unable to control herself. The darkness of her heart was removed forever. Due to the excessive delight and joy she fainted and fell down. Just when Raghunath got up, the lustre vanished. After a long and deep sleep when a man wakes up and as he thinks—‘Today, I took a long sound sleep being unaware of everything’ such is the condition of Shri Raghunath today. He thought that he was enjoying a very sound sleep, who awoke him up? He cast his look all around but nothing except darkness was visible there. By the God’s inspiration his past memory came back, all the occurrences began to flash before his eyes. I am the same Raghunath. I was dying by taking poison, what an horrible pain was! What a fierce affliction was! I had gone fainted with its effect. Who pacified my affliction? Who revived me to life? O! I have understood, it was the grace of Supreme Lord Hari! O the ocean of mercy! Except you, who is there another one to show mercy to me—your devotee! O my Lord! It is You only to know Your own play! It is You to throw down from Your lap and it is You only to give fondly affection taking up in your lap clinging to Your bosom. What will an ignorant being like me understand the secret of Your this frolicsome sport? O Lord! What is the need to understand? Give, Give my Lord! Give me agony, pour down on me the mountain of miseries, as much as possible, I am ready to welcome them. At least I will be able to see Your loving and affectionate vision to pacify the blazing flame of the heart after every misery. Enough! What more needed. This is the highest gain for me. I feel supremely peaceful. ‘So, my Lord! Give me the charity of misery again and again.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is not known that devotee Raghunath did speak so many words for the Lord Hari—the remover of distress, how much he laughed, how much he wept and how long did he continue conversing to the Lord, at last he began to chant divine names such as ‘Ram-Krishna-Hari’ with the choked voice. In the intoxication of the name of ‘Hari’, Raghunath became unconscious of the body and self, he became completely devoid of the worldly knowledge. In the twinkling of an eye the whole night passed away. Steeped in sin, Karan family passed the whole night sleeplessly; all passed the night changing sides on the bed. The burning sensation of these sinners heart was more fierce than the blaze of Raghunath’s poison. The sorrow of the person causing pain to anyone or wants to do so, is more dreadful than that of the sufferer. Raghunath had become unconscious due to poison, he had not to suffer long with its affliction, but Gangadhar, his wife and all the seven sons remained burning in the pyre of imaginary worry and fear the whole night. This sin got disclosed as ‘Somebody informed the royal court. ‘These royal constables came to arrest us; and escorted away’ etc., thousands of worries made their hearts disrupt in a single night. Sometimes they got up to sit, sometimes moved in the courtyard, used to tremble with fear just having any sound, looked outside through the windows again and again, but it had become very difficult for them to pass the night. For sinners the black night also becomes longer. Watching some brightness they left their beds and came out. All of them reached the kitchen’s adjoining room with the motive to bury the corpse in the earth hurriedly. Going towards Gangadhar, unlocked the room. The morning had already set in. The sun-rays had made the house bright. In that clear light whatever they saw, first they could not believe in. They saw—‘Raghunath is sitting on his dining seat steadily unmoved; his body is getting thrilled with joy, the divine light is scattering on his face, the water of tears is overflowing from his steady eyes, his lips are shivering, on some intervals the unclear chanting of ‘Ram-Krishna-Hari’ is being made as if he is any immortal god of any other divine world.’ All were wonder struck. They became blunt and bloodless. They lost their wit. They got stunned. Everyone was looking towards otherone’s face. They became dumb. All went inside the house. Raghunath is sitting unmoved in the same position. Feeling the sound of foot-steps, Raghunath, absorbed in divine love stretching his both hands began to call—‘Come, come, O my Lord!’ Just saying so he stood up in rashness. Having opened his eyes he says to himself to see them—‘The Lord is not here; Hari-Hari! Here are my killers—my father-in-law, my mother-in-law, my brother-in-laws the whole group to kill me is standing.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Like an intoxicated swaying away again, sat on his seat. Now, Gangadhar and others got afraid, they thought—‘This is not a common man, after such a poisoning even a man can never remain alive. Isn’t it that he is any god? Being overpowered with fear and astonishment, all caught the feet of Raghunath and began to beg for pardon.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Raghunath said in pleasant mood smiling—‘Here, you are not at fault, all reap the fruit of their actions. Probably, I had given poison to anyone in my previous birth, that is why I had to take poison in this birth, The fruit of action is inevitable. Yes, certainly I got revived to life even after bitter poisoning, the reason behind it is only that the <span class="char-style-override-7">l</span>ord of my life is the Lord Jagannath. Now, I have to make only one urge to you—‘All of you want to marry your daughter to someone else, seeing my condition of a destitute, if you consider it proper, then do so, show mercy to me, I just go away; but the reality is that if you have the least moral fear in your mind then handover my wife to me, she is the partner of my joys and sorrows; I will take her with me; but whether you handover her to me or not depends on you. I will not force you.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After this version, chanting loudly the divine names as ‘Mukund! Madhav! Murari! and others’, Raghunath came out of the house on the pathway. Gangadhar, along with his all the seven sons rushed after him, caught his hand and said—‘Please, stay one day, tomorrow, you may take your wife with you, we will have no objection. Hearing this, Raghunath sat there under the shadow of the tree; he did not enter again the sinful house. He made up his mind that the Lord Jagannath who made my reach possible to this place, who saved my life, will do whatever He thinks proper regarding Annapurna also.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even after the long persuasion of Gangadhar when Raghunath did not move from there, then being helpless he along with his sons came to his house. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Regaining consciousness Annapurna had gone to her bedroom being assured that her life partner was alive, but she was still suspicious of her family members. The wicked father and her brothers locked her in her room, so she could not come out of her room. That is why, she was quite unaware of any occurrence in the morning. She was fluttering like a bird in a cage, inside her bed-room. Coming inside the house Gangadhar unlocked her room and along with his wife and sons he began to ask her—‘Tell me Annapurna! Do you want to accompany your street beggar husband or you want to live with us? The wretched persons cannot presume the heart-agony of a chaste lady caused by such a question. Yet it is but natural for a daughter to feel shame and hesitation before her father. So, in a modest and shy voice but firmly Annapurna said—‘Father! Pardon me for my fault, I will go with my husband. He may be a street-beggar, destitute, whatever he is, after all he is my god. He alone is my resort.’ While saying so, Annapurna due to misery and anger breaking down the bounds of shame, she roared like a lion, Annapurna was no more a helpless lady of a simple and meek class. Annapurna turned Durga incarnate to annihilate the wicked demoniac group and to burn them to ashes with the fire of her eyes. She said in harsh and rude words—‘Father! Father! Do you want to make me corrupt? Do you want to handover me to an other man depriving me of my husband? It will not be so, it will never be so, don’t treat me a common girl. I am chaste, so long as I am alive, none can touch me. Be sure that I will commit suicide before if so happens and the world of your happiness will perish to dust in the twinkling of an eye by the curse of a lady of chastity.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How long can the heat remain in the water? Coolness is its nature. In the same way, the rage of the placid and simple Annapurna could not stay long. She caught the feet of her father and started saying so in the sweet and pathetic tone—‘Father! Forgive me. Let me accompany my husband. If I am an ascetic, then my lord deserves begging, it is he only the support of my life. It will be never beneficial to you to disallow me to go. That is why, I request you with folded hands to allow me to accompany my husband.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Considering the influence of Raghunath and seeing this condition of Annapurna with fear and worry, all the family members decided to send Annapurna with Raghunath. Gangadhar took away Annapurna with wealth and jewels to Raghunath and very humbly he said—‘Son! Accept your wife, remain kind to us so that any inauspicious may not happen to us.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Falling at the feet of her husband with the feeling of exclusive loyality, Annapurna surrendered herself, and then at once she began to say standing up—‘O the lord of my soul! Please start to move to any direction you want sooner, it is not right to make delay of a single minute to stay here. Your handmaid is ready to accompany you. Holding the hands of his wife and calling the words ‘Jay Jagannath’ Raghunath set out towards Puri.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Gangadhar came back home; but he felt much aggrieved to send his daughter with a beggar. On the other hand, Annapurna’s mother plotted a new conspiracy. A wicked mind thinks of wickedness always. She conveyed the message to the minister’s son—‘The destitute is taking away Annapurna; if you have courage, bring Annapurna having killed him.’ God knows whether it was a mother’s affection to her daughter due to attachment or a great sinful mind. However—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just while getting the message, the minister’s son with the support of his father started in search of Raghunath with one thousand horse-riders. What time will it take for the horse-riders to reach them who are going on foot? Raghunath was greatly astonished to see the dust in the sky and hear the sound of kettledrum and hoof from behind. It took no time when the wicked reached close to Raghunath and began to say roaring—‘Mean fellow, scoundrel! Where are you running away having stolen my sweet-heart? Run away from here at once leaving this beauty queen here, otherwise you will lose your life.’ Raghunath saw that there were thousands of horse riders with him. Raghunath got absorbed in love to see this new frolicsome play of the Lord and began to laugh to see towards the minister’s son with fearless eyes. Undoubtedly, Annapurna got frightened badly. She said—‘My father wanted to handover me in the hands of this wicked, now, what to do? How will we get rid of this misery? Bursting to laughter to hear the frightened words of his chaste wife, Raghunath said—‘Why do you fear so much? Don’t you know that the Lord Jagannath is my Lord? What does this misery mean? He who united us, who revived the dead from poison, will save us from this misery also? Don’t insult that ever-protecting Lord, keeping the worry and fear in your mind, what is the fear for us even in the presence of the Lord whose lotus feet are always meditated by the gods like Indra and Brahma etc.? You do watch His frolicsome sport. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord’s sporting is strange. While the conversation between Annapurna and Raghunath was still going on, when the two Rajput horse riders well armed with arms and weapons riding their horses very fast happened to reach there. Just reaching there they asked Raghunath—‘Who are you? Where do you go? Who is this charming lady with you? Whose is this army and why are they chasing you?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Relating the entire story Raghunath said—‘Brother! I am an orphan, I have no support of anyone except the Lord Jagannath and neither any other one is there to provide me shelter nor anyone to protect me. That is why I am waiting for His grace with restless heart.’ Both the brave soldiers said—‘You should have no fear, we just follow you. Let us see who is there to attack you? Raghunath understood that this was all the sportive play of his Lord. Raghunath and Annapurna began to move fearlessly under their protection. The army of the minister’s son saw that in the twinkling of an eye the two brave Rajput warriors turned into lakhs. All the warriors are protecting Raghunath and Annapurna. The minister’s son and his soldiers ran away to escape their lives wherever they could go for the safety. Just as the frogs escape away to see the serpent, in the same way, all the soldiers ran away within no time. Annapurna and Raghunath remained quite unaware of it. After crossing the boundary of the state, both the braves said to Raghunath—‘Go, now you have no fear at all; we depart now, we have other so many engagements. Offering them hundreds of salutations Raghunath said to them—‘Braves! Today we have been protected from the wickeds by your mercy. Whoever you may be, but you are our life saviour. Salutation to your feet again and again. Smiling both the braves went away from there. It is not known whether the both were Nar-Narayan incarnate or some other uncommon celestial. Raghunath could not recognise them but it was his firm conviction that he was protected from this great misery only by the grace of kind-hearted Lord Jagannath. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After some days, the couple reached Puri. By viewing the sight of the Lord, their entire fatigue was removed. With the money given by her father, Annapurna purchased a house to the south of the temple. The both, wife and husband began to live in that house happily. To relate the fables of the Lord Krishna, to chant the divine name of Krishna, to listen to the merits and virtues of Krishna, to remain absorbed in the love of Krishna, to dance as if mad in the name of Krishna and shed tears, were only work of the both.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The feeling of the Lord is the feeling of the devotee. We can visualise the feeling of the devotee. All are not fortunate to realise the sentiments of God. God is the embodiment of nectarean passions. He is the store-house of sweet emotions. That is the reason that when the intoxicated devotee forgetting his own identity in His sentiment, absorbed in His taste, dances and sings, the eyes of even the hypocrite are dazzled to see it—his mind and spirit are melted. When the devotee, mad in the love of God views the sight of His Lord how charming, how enchanting He looks to him, it is known to him only who has experienced it. This pleasant and charming appearance of the Lord is beyond the description in words. At that moment the Lord becomes unique and exceptional. At that moment bursting out of the idol of wood, stone or metal, a sweet, loving, charming idol appears. Have you ever been fortunate to see such a figure with mental eyes? If not, then see today Raghunath, absorbed and overjoyed in the Lord’s love, through your mental eyes and make yourself fortunate to see the vision of Jagannath before him. Once, having seen him, see Him and then seeing, see him. You will also sink yourself in the Ocean-depth of ever-new, ever-sweet, ever-blissful Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sometimes Raghunath dances, sometimes rolls down on the ground, sometimes raising his both hands relates his emotional feelings to the Lord in the dumb language; sometimes talks to Him through his tears and laughs. It means that being completely dedicated himself to the Lord, merging himself with Him he is dwelling in the sphere of the Lord. The chaste Annapurna also remains always busy in the service of her husband and the great Lord of her lord.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Devotee–Damodar and his Ideal Wife</p>
<p class="Numbers">(1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Damodar lived there in the city named Kanchi. He was a Brahman by caste. He had no issue. There was only the Brahmini in the house. Begging was the only means of their livelihood. It was hard to find any other so poor a beggar as Damodar in the whole world. It was the daily routine of Damodar to get up early in the morning, to take bath, and perform daily rituals, to put sandal paste on the forehead and having worn the garland of Tulasi, already offered to Lord and chanting divine Name ‘Ram-Krishna-Hari,’ to set out for begging in the city. He remained satisfied with the alms whatever he got without any consideration whether he got something or not, He used to handover whatever he begged the whole day, to the <span class="char-style-override-7">B</span>rahmini. The faithful Brahmini cooked the food with great pleasure. Having offered the food to god, both the wife-husband remained pleased with taking the food of the offering. If any day, any hungry and thirsty guest happened to come, first they offered the meals to him. If something is remaining they used to eat, otherwise the day passed on fast. The couple did not feel any agony but kept the fast that day very happily. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There main work was adoration of Shri Govinda. They remained obsessed with it day and night. No other talk, no condemnation of anyone at all. Their heart remained always melted with the feeling of kindness for all the beings. Nothing was in their house but they demanded nothing for themselves from the God. If they expected anything from the Lord, that was only the redemption of the beings. While singing in the praise of the Lord, whenever the feeling touched their mind that the Lord would bless them with His sight, only then they prayed with folded hands—‘O auspicious! The beings of the earth did not get Your auspicious sight, they are clung to the inauspicious assuming as if auspicious. O Lord! Be graceful to them, remove their illusion, water their heart with Your holy stream of the Mandakini of joy. May all live with mutual love and co-operation forgetting the violence and hostility! May Your benedictory form remain awakened in the heart of everyone!’ </p>
<p class="Numbers">(2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The scent of musk comes out even if it is covered with the leather. In the same way, the fragrance of Damodar’s repute also spread over the entire country piercing the curtain of his tattered clothing and decrepit hut. Gradually, this fragrance spread to that real country—the Supreme Lord of all the worlds also. The loving king of that real country, the Supreme Lord with the clue of that fragrance came to the city, Kanchi one day. His motive was to test the real and unreal. The king is, no doubt, a great mystic! Just reaching there He disguised Himself as an old ascetic. The body so feeble and old that He is unable to walk even a step onward. With the support of a walking-stick, moving slowly and slowly He happened to come at the gate of the destitute Damodar.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was the play of God, Damodar did not get a fist of rice even that day in the alms. He came back home empty-handed. The husband-wife, both began to meditate the charming feet of the Lord (Chintamani) lying down on the ground with the empty stomach.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">They began to say to themselves—‘Lord! You are the Supreme Lord, you can bless and deprave whatever You want but the destitutes have no other support than you. You are the only kindred for them, that is why You are called the ‘Great ocean of mercy’ and the supporter of the destitutes; it is only You to support them who have no support of anyone. Like the thunderbolt sheath, You cover the body of Your devotee and remove his all the vices. Lord! You are the death-serpent for the frogs in the form of wickeds. You are the invaluable ‘Chintamani’ for the living beings of the universe and for the uncontrolled mad elephants in the guise of the human beings. You are apparently a lion. You are the Lord of entire beings, that is why this meanest creature has come to Your shelter. Save this creature from a fear, O my Lord! Make haste to protect me, there is no other fear. This devotee is not afraid of even death because of the boundless glory of the name of the Supreme Lord, then, there is no question of fear from such trivial fears of this world. This slave does not pray even to remove such fear. Here, this slave is afraid of that if any guest happened to come at this moment how to manage food to serve him.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Where there was the fear of lion, the evening set in.’ Damodar and his wife were just worrying, their fear materialised, they heard these pitiful words of a guest—‘Who is there in the house? This guest is standing at your door.’ Just hearing these pitiful words of the guest Damodar came out in a hurry. He saw a lustrous but very old, feeble and tired Yogi standing at the gate. Damodar saluted him lying flat on the ground and asked him with folded hands in very humble words—‘Lord! What is your command to this slave?’ The hermit said—‘Brother! I have heard too much of your repute. As I have heard that you welcome any guest whole-heartedly and provide him meal warmly. I don’t take meal of everyone who is indifferent to the guest-service, and don’t even cast my look towards his house despite his persistence, but even I eat by begging the food from devotees who have veneration for guests. Your name very oftenly comes to my ears in the list of the guest-servers; that is why my mind tempted for your meal. Today it came to my mind, let me once take my meal at Damodar’s house, brother! This is the reason that I have come to you. I am old, I am hardly able to move but in the temptation of sharing your meal I did come here; tell me, may I get a handful of grain or not?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What was the fear in Damodar’s mind, that happened so. Damodar was extremely worried to hear the demand of guest, Ultimately <span class="char-style-override-8">‘होइहैं सोइ जो राम रचि राखा।’</span> means ‘Everything depends on the God’s will.’ Keeping it in mind, washing the feet of the <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ogi he spoke in the sweet accents—‘Maharaj! I find you greatly tired. Relax a bit on this Kusha-Seat. Just I come.’ Approaching the Brahmini Damodar said to her very gently—‘O the chaste! The guest has arrived here at the gate, he wants to have some food. There is nothing in the house, now, what should be done?’ The Brahmini said—‘Lord! What should I tell you, nothing is hidden to you; it is not possible to get a single paise even after selling the whole house. If there had been a single cloth in the house, I would have brought something by selling it, even that is not in my possession. These torn clothes and broken earthen pots are the entire property of our house. What will we get in its return?’ While stating so the Sati’s eyes began to shed tears considering herself unable to serve the guest. Seeing this condition of his wife Damodar’s eyes were also filled with tears. Taking a long breath he said—‘Then, what to do Sati! Will the guest not be attended? What is the purpose of life if the guest returns hungry? Govind! Why so hard a trial?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being worried the Brahmini began to call ‘Shri Hari’ with her distressed heart and only after a moment, startling Damodar with her laugh said—My lord! Why are you so impatient? Our Lord is Jagannath; He is sure to provide us grain for the guest. Do one thing, go to the barber and bring a scissor from him at once, then I will disclose you the means. Damodar was fast to bring the scissor immediately and began to say to the Brahmini—‘Now, tell me, what should I do?’ Showing her long hair she said smiling—‘Cut my these long and shining hair with this scissors and then both of us will prepare the rope with it and you will go and bring some money by selling it. What is then worry for the hospitality of the guest  when we have this much support?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Damodar was charmed with this entrancing spirit of sacrifice and unique foresightedness of the Brahmini and began to cut her hair with his own hands. He cut her all the hair in one sweep leaving a few around. They twisted at once a beautiful rope with their joint effort. Damodar went to the market to sell it. Fortunately, he got a customer also. He purchased the rope for a few coins. Damodar purchased pulse, rice, ghee, milk, curd, green vegetables with this money for the guest-reception and came to his wife happily and put all the objects before her. The Brahmini was very expert in cooking. In the twinkling of an eye, the meals were prepared. Coming out Damodar requested the reverent guest to accept the dish. The guest entered the house, both the wife and husband washed his feet with a great reverence, with a great veneration they took His feet water and sprinkled over their head. Today, their joys had no bound. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In reality, who can imagine the glory of their luck? Today Damodar got the opportunity to sip that holy water of the Lord’s feet without any effort sitting at home, which is unobtainable to even Brahma, though it remains in his ‘Kamandal’. The Lord is under the sway of lovely sentiments. Where the lotus of lovely feelings blossoms like a black-bee avaricious of the flower juice, God presents himself, but the man devoid of sentiment, can never attain Him.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a broken square wooden seat in the Brahman’s house. The wife-husband got the hermit seated on it reverently. They served the food on the banana leaf. The lady Brahman began to serve and Damodar began to fan and Shri Govind of frolicsome sports began to eat joyfully. Thinking that ‘The Sadhu is too old to eat so much’, the lady Brahman had served the food in scanty, but Hari in the guise of an old ascetic finished the whole food in no time and said—‘Very tasty food has been prepared. I want more if you have, today I am feeling very much sated by eating.’ The lady Brahman served whatever was there remaining in the kitchen. The omniscient God came to know that there was left nothing for them to eat. So, He ate away leaving nothing. Then, having washed his hands and mouth he sat comfortably. Chewing the betel he began to think—‘Aha! Their life is praiseworthy, they have nothing in the house, only the objects they possess are the torn cloth and a broken earthen pot, but what a unique love they have in attending the guest. Having served Me the entire food they remained hungry themselves; but there is no trace of discontentment at all on their faces. The women leave no stone unturned in maintaining their hair, but this Brahmin lady did not show the least attachment to her hair while getting it cut down for the service of the guest. They are unparallel in the world. It is not known to what extent the Lord Madhav, hungry of His devotee’s sentimental love, went while absorbed in deep thinking. After sometime He called Damodar and said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Devotee! I am highly satisfied with your dedicated service. Brother! Just see, now it is night, my body is too old, I think that I will be unable to walk in the night today. Having passed my night here, tomorrow in the morning I will depart. There is no need to collect more objects for my meal; One earthen pot-rice will serve my purpose.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Damodar—‘As your command’. Saying so he went to his wife and said to her in anxiety—‘Sati! The guest has no vitality to walk today, he will stay here in the night. How should we arrange for his meals?’ The chaste Brahmin lady had the knowledge of means, She said smiling—‘What is the worry? Cut down these remaining hair, we will twist the rope just now and by selling it bring the food materials. Why are you so much perturbed?’ Damodar became emotional to hear his wife’s words. He cut all the hair of her head. Both twisted the rope just then, having sold it, he bought the food materials as before. The Brahmini began to cook food with exhilarated mood. She covered her head with a rag. With this wonderful sacrifice of the virtuous Sati, the guest was honoured. Damodar is very much pleased with this service of the guest, but when his sight falls on the head of the Brahmini, he fails to check the tears of his eyes. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The food was prepared. The guest sat down to eat. ‘A little more, a little more’ saying thus, he finished the whole food of the kitchen again. Not a single food material even to satisfy an ant was left there in the kitchen. ‘The guest washed his hands and mouth, Damodar spread the torn seat of leaves and grass for the guest to sleep. The hermit slept on this happily. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The same Narayan sleeps on the bedstead of Sheshnag, who seats on the back of Garuda, in the hearts of the saints or in the inner vital part of the Lord Shiva, is sleeping comfortably on the bed of ‘Kush Kislaya’ being under the sway of His devotees love. Blessed is the pure love of devotee and blessed is God who is under the sway of devotee’s love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Damodar began to massage His feet slowly and slowly and his wife began to fan with the corner of her torn ‘Sari’ and steeped in devotees love the Lord unconscious of ‘Self’ began to enjoy the comfortable sleep considering the heavenly joy too trivial.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To see the guest asleep, the Brahmini said to the husband, ‘Oh! This Sadhu is too old. How will he be able to walk even in the morning with his so weak body? Tomorrow in the morning you should go for begging, by luck, whatever is available we will serve Him with that much; we will go on fast tomorrow also as today. As was the Brahmini so was the Brahman; he gave consent.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What does the sleeping and awakening mean for the Supreme Lord who is beyond all the three, awakefulness, dream and deep sleep? The Lord is listening to this conversation of the couple closing his eyes; The tears were filled in the eyes of the Lord to hear the sweet words and the affectionate spirit for the guest. From the corner of His eyes compassion began to overflow. Now, the Lord could not check Himself, He made the Brahman couple asleep by his divine potency and Himself, got up at once. He found the couple lying between His feet. The Lord, at once, placed His hands on the shaved head of the the chaste Brahmini and caressing it with His hands said—‘O the chaste lady! <span class="char-style-override-7">O m</span>other! Ah! How much sweetness is there in calling Mother. Let me say if again! Mother! Mother! May your head be covered again with the hair! Mother! May your body glitter with different kinds of ornaments of gems and jewels! May your all the body limbs glitter with beauty and exceptional charm! As the Lord went on blessing, so it took place. The Lord stood up, cast his look all around and then began to speak in the compassionate voice—‘The hut! May it be converted to palace!’ It was done so; the Lord said—‘The House-door! May it be full with wealth and gems! The same happened. Putting His hands on the heads of the both, He showering the nectar said—‘And! So long as you are alive, live comfortably and after death directly come to the divine abode. I, the companion of your life and death, will remain accompanying you forever. Blessed are you!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having blessed the devotee with rare blessing’s, Lord disappeared. The morning set in, the Brahmini got up, just opening her eyes, she was wonder-struck. She began to think of the miracle—‘O! Am I the same, where gone my torn sari? How are available here the valuable garments? How was my body loaded with ornaments? Keeping her hands on her head she began to think. As she touched her head her wonder waved—‘O! How did so charming hair grow on my shaved head in a single night? How such a charm and beauty in withered body? Am I dreaming isn’t it? Where has the old Sadhu gone away?’ The Brahmini stood up in hurry, now her amazement had no bound, neither was the hut nor was the bed of grass and leaf. Neither is there the broken earthen pot nor the torn clothes. The Brahmini also like Sudama began to say in bewilderment—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">फूटी एक थारी बिन टोटनीकी झारी हुति, </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Oh O! Such a grand palace, so big rooms, all the jewels and gems, such a prosperity and wealth, abundance of ornaments and garments! Are! My lords appearance and figure also changed! How did he become cupid in his apperance? What a wonderful is all this? Being perturbed, the lady Brahman pulling the border of clothing awoke her husband and began to say in a loud voice—‘Lord! Just see, what is this wonder?’ Damodar got up, sat rubbing his eyes and saying ‘what, what and began to stare all around in bewilderness. Sati now could not bear delay, led husband outside holding his hands and said—‘My lord! See all these later on, first go to search the guest. Where did he disappear? He was not a common Sadhu.’ Damodar saw that there was nothing of the past. Everything has completely changed; Piercing the mountain of poverty and sorrow, the pleasant rays of the soothing and cool light of prosperity are spreading all around. The Brahman could not proceed ahead. Steeped in love he remained stood there. The body got thrilled, the tears streamed forth from his eyes. Damodar with the choking voice said—‘Beloved! Stay, whether that old man was any human being that I should go to search him? If he wants to bless with his vision he can appear  even inside here. Until he wills we cannot locate him however we roam about inside or outside. Tell me where should I go to search that eternal Supreme Being? He is omnipresent, otherwise nowhere. If He wants, He can provide His sight just here, otherwise nowhere. Could you not recognise Him still? Who is there anyone to do such a work except the Lord affectionate to His devotees whose merely name made the stone float on the water, only the touch of whose feet transformed the stone to Ahilya, the saint’s beautiful wife, the touch of whose body-limb made Kubja so charming a lady? See towards your face! The same ‘Primeval Being’ who creates, sustains and annihilates the phenomenal universe, had visited your house to sanctify it in the form of an old aged guest. Sati goddess! Let us go to His refuge. Let us beg for pardon with the pathetic voice, Alas! We took him only as a common man; how many flaws we committed unknowingly is not known! Oh! We lost the gem from our hands!’ Stating so they began to pray hymns in His praise.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Lord! The ocean of kindness! Forgive us for our flaws, we have committed blunder but You are, O the Lord, the ocean of kindness. God! You are the sole Lord of the universe, You indwell in the heart of every being forever, nothing is hidden to you. So, this is our prayer, O Lord! To forgive us for the sin committed by us due to ignorance.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Damodar and his wife obsessed with love, made the prayer of the Lord for a long time. They both wept-rolled on the ground and became oblivious of themselves. At last, when they became conscious, they began to prepare for the great ceremony. Their whole life passed in the devotional service of the Lord and in the service of His devotee just likewise Lord and in the service of cows, Brahmans, the helpless, sorrow stricken, destitutes. After death, assuming the divine bodies they waited upon the Lord of Vaikuntha in the divine abode.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Devotee–Gopal Charawaha</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There lived a cowherd in the city named Kamalawati of the Northern state. His name was Gopal. As was his name so was his work—to earn his livelihood by tending and grazing the cows. Gopal was neither literate nor had he ever heard any religious discourse. He was unacquainted with the moral conduct and ideas also. Basically, there is no much importance of the outer conduct and ideas also. To maintain the conduct favourable to the Lord, is the real character and the true thought is the constant meditation of the Lord. Unless a man is endowed with such a conduct and character, he cannot be dear of the Lord. Gopal was of such a pure conduct and thought; he used to wander about in the forest with the cows throughout the day. He had his wife and son in the family, but he had no special worry for them. Never he went home. In the noon, his wife brought to him the mid-day meal. Having partaken of plain and simple food, Gopal used to roam about like the animal among the animals. He had a special virtue that he had full faith in the holy name of Shri Hari; he considered the name of Shri Hari leading to highest good and repeated His name with ardent love in the morning and in the evening. In real sense, lover of Shri Hari’s native is a great saint. Tulasidas Maharaj has written—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Tulasidas says that if by mistake even the word ‘Ram’ comes out from the mouth of a person, I offer the skin of my body for his shoes. Even if born in a lower caste, as pariah repeats and chants divine name ceaselessly, is virtuous than he who is born in a high family of upper caste but never mutters the name of ‘Hari’. Then, what good purpose that high family serves?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Time passes away very fast. Gopal now became fifty years old. The men of his age group ridiculing him passed the satirical remark—‘To repeat the name of ‘Ram Ram’ does not pave the path for divine abode’. Such type of taunt pinched his heart too much and he took it very ill, but he kept mum and did not react. One day, a saint passing by, said to them to see the behaviour of those passing remark—‘Brothers! You are committing a great mistake—he who mutters the holy name of the Lord with true heart and mind considering it good as advised by his Guru, gets deliverance from this world of misery without any effort. What to talk of the joys and comforts of the kings and Emperors, he gets the joys of the supreme abode of Supreme Lord even infinite times better bliss than the joys of Brahmaloka world. If this old cowherd mutters the name of the Lord, even when ignorant of its influence, the Lord’s name is so influencial that he will get a preceptor to guide him the direct path to the abode of the Supreme Lord. As a man is burnt with the touch of fire without knowing about it, in the same way Lord’s name burns all the sins to ashes. If a fool continuously goes on chanting the Lord’s name unknowingly, even he is sure to get any saint to push him ahead on the spiritual path by imparting him knowledge and in the long run, he gets deliverance.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Those rediculing Gopal felt ashamed to hear the words of the saint, Gopal was also hearing all this. The speech of the saint, his countenance and the influence of Lord’s name had an indelible impact on Gopal’s mind. Coming near the saint he caught his feet and urged him for initiation. The saint had evolved himself spirituality that he had no more any trace of craving to be a preceptor. He used to move about steeped in divine love. With the inborn feeling of kindness he said after hearing the request of the cowherd—‘Just see brother! To play the role of a preceptor is very difficult for me but you certainly need a Guru. As without an experienced boatman the boat cannot be sailed, so an experienced Guru is needed to cross this worldly ocean escaping through the dreadful waves to sail the boat of life also. Therefore, you should also surrender the helm of your life-boat in the hands of a worthy preceptor. Then, without any fear and soon you will reach across this great worldly sea very comfortably. Then, you too, will become a true saint and the Lord will be kind enough to bless you with His vision. Brother Gopal! Several persons have attained deliverance till now in this way. On this way, from time to time many high- souled saints and Sadhu happen to pass on and you will come across with someone some day. Make your Guru to him whose sight may destroy all the sinful tendencies, may arouse by hearing his words you enjoy wonderful bliss and by touching whose feet you develop sattvic feelings in your heart love of the Lord like flash of lightning.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Gopal felt overjoyed to hear the words of the saint and to know that he also might be blessed with the vision of the Lord, he became extremely enthusiastic. Having said this much the saint took his way. Gopal decided to find out a Guru. He expressed his wish before his friends and well-wishers. They said—‘Where will you find such a Guru?’ Gopal said modestly—‘Why not?’ Saint has already assured. A number of saints and ascetics pass by this way, some or the other will do come across. He has mentioned the characteristics; I will at once distinguish. When Guru comes across, I will serve him the fresh milk; and then he will be pleased with me. I will express myself—‘Guruji! I cannot be able to understand your profound  knowledge, kindly tell me only one thing, I will follow it whole-heartedly, I cannot involve myself in complexity; the reverent Guru will surely accept me as one’s own to hear my prayer. The friends and intimates began to laugh to hear Gopal’s words. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, Gopal began to wait anxiously. As the days passed, his restlessness also increased with the same speed. Till now, he had only one work to tend the cows- grazing and now, he got an other work also. Gopal used to sit on the highway and used to stare intently the faces of the passers by. He asked the travellers, ‘Have you seen any saint coming on this side?’ Sometimes climbing on the trees he watched from a long distance. Thus, his mind began to feel restless for Guru excessively. Sometimes he started weeping being impatient. By and by his rashness went on growing. Now, he has no rest of mind at all; his eyes always remain wet with tears. It never takes long time to fulfil the true longing. <span class="char-style-override-8">‘जेहि कें जेहि पर सत्य सनेहू। सो तेहि मिलइ न कछु संदेहू॥’</span> For one gets united without doubt with him for whom one cherishes true love. If the true curiosity and longing is there and the impatience increases to such a loving man, the Lord Himself may come before in the form of the reverent Guru. There should be true longing.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, it did not take more time for restless Gopal to get a Guru. By the inspiration of God a great God devotee saint moved towards the same direction where Gopal was sitting in the search of Guru. Gopal was already waiting intently, just seeing the reverent man from a distance he began to feel delighted in his heart. Seeing his condition some unique, he at once happened to call—‘Aha! Excellent! ‘The reverent Guru to lead me to cross the worldly sea is coming.’ The venerable Guru will require to be served with fresh milk so Gopal rushed up to milk the cow; the emotional waves of several longings began to rise in his blissful mind. In the meanwhile that calm, cultured, serene and lustrous personage came near him. Leaving the work of milking the cow in the middle, Gopal rushed. He had the pot of milk in one hand and the bamboo-stick to control the cows in the other hand. In the same condition Gopal began to call—‘Maharaj! Stay, stay. Kindly drink a little milk and then go.’ Hearing the impatient voice, the saint halted. In the meantime approaching him, Gopal bent down his head to his feet. Both the hands were engaged so he could not touch his feet. Then, with the natural feeling of simplicity and purity he said—‘O the venerable god! <span class="char-style-override-7">k</span>indly take me across the ocean of this world. Quaff this milk and grace me with your sermon. Having stated so, he put the pot of the milk and the stick aside and clinging to his feet he said—‘Give me sermons, Gurudev! <span class="char-style-override-7">e</span>mancipate me, until you accept, I will not release your feet.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the first instance, the saint was taken aback; but his heart was filled with pity to see Gopal’s simple and devotional sentiment. The spontaneous overflow of tears from Gopal’s eyes were the evidence of the purity of his heart. The saint said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Brother! Sit down; leave my feet, I will follow you to your house and there at a secluded holy place, I will give you initiation as my pupil. It seems to see you that you have not taken bath for many days.’ Gopal said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Maharaj! I have learnt only to tend the cows remaining in the forest, I have neither any care of my family nor I visit home ever and nor I know to bathe even. Kindly, just now give me sermons here itself. I am unable to bear the delay of going home.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Love knows no rule. There can be no binding of any rule for a really impatient in the fulfilment of his desires. Seeing him impatient for divine love the saint’s heart melted. He said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Brother! I will give you sermon here, but you will have to take a pledge before initiation, you will have to take some vows. Tell me will you obey what I say or not?’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Gopal said—‘Lord! I will certainly obey but I am illiterate, I may not be capable to do many things. Tell me a simple means. I will fulfil it as per your order whole- heartedly.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The saint was higly pleased with the guileless words of Gopal and sat down there remembering the Lord Govind. After purifying the mind and seat etc., taking out a little water from his ‘Kamandal’ he sprinkled it on Gopal’s body and then gave him a spell and said—‘My child! Since this moment whatever you eat, first offer it to the Lord Govind and then eat yourself. Enough! Only by this single means the Lord will be graceful to you. Hearing the words of the venerable Guru, Gopal saluted his feet with his cheerful heart and said—‘O Venerable! At any cost I will do so; but I have in my mind one thing to ask you, ‘as you instructed to eat after offering the meal to the Lord Govind, I want to know what is the appearance of that Lord, where does he live and how to view His sight? kindly tell me about these things also.’ The saint said–</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘My child! That Lord is present in everyone’s innerself; the entire universe is pervaded by Him. So, He will appear before you wherever you remember Him with sincerity of your heart. The appearance of the Lord Shri Krishna is very charming, His body is very handsome of swarthy colour, His both the eyes are very charming like the bloomed lotus. Like the moon of the full moon night in the autumn, His countenance constantly rains the nectar—Aha! All the miseries and worries are washed away only by His one sight. His lips  are red like the red and ripe ‘Bimba fruit’, the pleasant flute would be on His lips, He would be in the yellow sacred garment, (Pitambar) there is charming cincture in His waist and anklet would be glamorous in His feet. He who once gets this sweet and charming glimpse, becomes under his sway and absorbs himself in Him forever. Automatically his body, mind and entire property is dedicated to His lotus feet. Then, no other discussion or no other sight appeals to his mind as pleasant. You may be anywhere in any condition, you may call Him concentrating your mind to His such an appearance. There is no such a place where He is not present. Well! <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>ind it to eat any food object only after offering Him. Keep in mind never forget doing so. By the grace of the God, only this practice will bring the highest good to you.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having given this sermon, the saint drank the milk of Gopal and departed from there. Gopal, too, saluted his feet lying flat on the ground joyfully and made his way to the cow-shed. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Gopal’s wife and sons were quite unaware of this. His wife came with midday meal and went away as usual placing it there near him. But Gopal’s mind was concentrated somewhere else today, His mind is concentrated today in the thought of the Lord and in His meditation. He began to think to himself—‘The reverent Guru has said that God Shri Hari is omnipresent, He is present everywhere at every moment, then, why is He not visible to me? Why not to concentrate my mind to the appearance of the Lord as narrated by the venerable Guru and see whether I get to see His sight or not.’ Gopal was roaming in this thought, in the meantime his wife had gone away placing his midday meal. After a while Gopal saw that his midday meal was placed there, just seeing the food, the command of the Guru came to his mind. Taking the meal, Gopal took it away to a solitary place. After sprinkling the water, he placed the bread on the leaf, he placed ‘Tulasidal’ on it, then closing his eyes, concentrating his mind to the Lord Govind, he began to offer the meal to Him. Folding his hands he said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Govind! Take it, take it the loaves of bread are here, my Lord! Kindly partake of it.’ The reverent Guru has instructed me to eat the remaining offering of the Lord, so, O my Lord! Come, enjoy this very simple meal of Gopal with joy! If You don’t eat I will have to remain starving. Lord! Although I am very hungry today, yet if you don’t eat, I will also not eat, I will keep fast. O the Lord of destitutes! Don’t delay now, accept this offering and grace your slave.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this practice, the evening set in; neither Govind came nor partook of the meal. Gopal was very much shocked. He ate nothing and throwing the bread in the forest he came back to his cow-shed. He did not eat anything in the night also. The next day, his wife brought the mid-day meal in the noon and placed it as usual. That day also he tried to call Govind sitting at a lonely place; but like the first day neither Govind came nor partook of his meal. Gopal was feeling appetite badly, but that devotee, simple-hearted cowherd Gopal was firmly determined in his mind that according to the command of the venerable Guru he would not eat at all, without being eaten by the Lord. Even today Gopal remained without food throwing the bread in the forest. In this way, the day after day began to pass. If it had been like the modern time, the devotional faith in the Lord and Guru both would have been shattered, and such a sentiment of devotion would have been bycotted. That was neither the age of arrogant rationalism like today, nor was there room in the mind of that rustic cowherd for wrong reasoning. He was tumbling about due to appetite. But he was firm on his promise and remained unmoved cheerfully.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, continuous eighteen days passed, neither Govind comes nor partakes of his meal. So, Gopal also remains hungry. In the period of eighteen days his body decaying day by day became skeleton, his stomach went inside belly and his eyes went deep inside, he began to faint while standing. The wife asked its reason to see decaying condition of her husband; but he remained silent. She used to go away placing his meal there and after her departure, Gopal, too, went to any lonely place to offer food but the poor one had to return daily being disappointed. In spite of it Gopal was firm on his promise; Daily he thought ‘Aha! Death is certain in this world one day later or sooner; then why to disobey the Guru’s instruction? The Guru’s command is dead sure true, if not possible here, then after death in the next world surely there will be God’s vision before my eye-sight. Whatever may happen but the Gurudev’s instruction cannot be violated. What an admirable devotion!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Aha! It is twenty-seventh day of Gopal’s fast, now he has become too weak to move even; his eyes have grown white. It seems that he has to depart from this mortal world today. Gopal’s wife came with the midday meal at her routine time. She felt much grieved to see the condition of her husband, she asked—‘Lord! What has happened with you?’ But there was no reply. She said—‘I stay here today instead of going home.’ But Gopal did not agree. Ultimately following her husband’s order, she went away with tears in her eyes. Just when his wife departed, Gopal anyhow, rose up and sat and hardly he stood up and took away the midday meal in a lonely place. As usual like other days, he began to pray in the meditation of the Lord. Today he was unable to sit; so lying down on the ground he began to call the Lord Govind. Today there is no end of his tears. The whole water of his body, came out in the form of tears through his eyes and whatever energy was there in his body and mind, came out and was used in his prayer. Gopal was already confident in his mind that today is his last prayer. Thus, praying he began to salute again and again. Today he had a unique restlessness and eagerness in his mind. Today it was the call from the depth of the innerself of Gopal. Now, how was it possible for Lord Hari to remain hidden, at once, He appeared before Gopal.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The same charming appearance was of the Lord as the reverent Guru had depicted. The charmfulness and glow of His face was thousand times more than the outworldly beauty, the Lord was in the holy ‘Pitamber’ garment, the fortunate flute is adding to its beauty in His lotus hands. Gopal was oblivious of himself by seeing the world enchanting vision of the Lord. Today Gopal’s joys have no bounds. Abruptly, his inactive parts of the body became active. It was created a new life and fresh consciousness in his body. Being wonder-struck he closed his eyes once; but in his meditation also he saw the same appearance, what was before his open eyes. At once, he opened his eyes. His heart was moved with the profound joy of ocean, the constant overflow of tears from his eyes started. He clinged to the feet of the Lord. His body thrilled with joy, his throat choked, he became dumb. His loveful tears washed the Lord’s feet. Affectionate to His devotees, the Lord took His simple devotee to his lap and wiped off his tears with His lotus hands, desired even by the gods and seers and raining the nectar from his cheerful lotus lips He said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘My dear Gopal! Don’t weep. Just see, for your love- sake I just eat your offered bread. I need such a food. I am in habit of eating such a food offered with the sentiment of whole-hearted love. Child! I am not fond of food, I am fond of the feeling of love of the loving devotees like you. Now, go home and console your wife-son and kith and kin, now you have no worry, passing your life in adoration, praying hymns, after death abide happily in divine abode.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having uttered so, smiling the Lord disappeared. Gopal had many thoughts in his mind to express but his tongue had stopped. He began to stare in the wonder-struck position towards the same direction where that image had abruptly disappeared and he was gazing towards the pleasant image. He came to the position of the serpent deprived of his gem. He burst into tears being restless from separation pain. He felt very much distressed from the agony of Lord’s separation. Then, recovering himself with some courage he rose up and partook of the remaining food. Just as he started eating the left-over offering, the bliss and peace began to expand. While eating the Lord’s offering he began to sing virtues of the Guru and Lord. The sound of ‘Jai Govind, Jai Gurudev, Jai Govind, Jai Govind’ began to come out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He finished his meals, it was not the appetite of only twenty seven days but his hunger and thirst of this birth and past births got satisfied forever. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By virtue of reliance on divine name, Mercy of God and unswerving faith on the words of Guru, Gopal got blessed with the rare vision of quite compassionate and devotee-affectionate God. Victory to the Lord and His devotee.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Devotee–Shantoba and his Wife</p>
<p class="Numbers"><span class="char-style-override-10">(1)</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the Mughal period, there lived a rich man named Shantoba in the village, Ranjanam in the South. Shantoba did not lack in worldly comforts. He had enough repute and respect also. In all the twenty-four hours, he remained engaged in the enjoyment of pleasures and fulfilling his fondings and considered this the bliss of life. He had no inkling of the real bliss even in dream. The frolicsome sport of the Lord is strange. If He wants He may make a mountain of a mole-hill and a great fool to a great scholar in a moment. Just by His grace there comes a wonderful change in man’s life and at the very moment, adopting the virtuous conduct, he becomes deserving of God-realization. On account of the noble deeds of the previous birth and grace of the Lord, it was the same case of Shantoba also. With the association of a great saint his vicissitudes of fortune abruptly changed. One day, the foremost devotee, Tukaramji visited his house. The association of saints is infallible. The true sermons of Tukaramji made a spell-bound effect on the heart of Shantoba. His illusion was cleared. He felt the unique joy in the company of the saint. He began to consider all the comforts and enjoyments of the world trivial to this joy. His eyes were overflowed with the tears of joy. Shantoba’s vision got changed anew. All the particles of the world began to look fresh and novel to his new vision. The fresh new morning set in the life of Shantoba.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Today, Shantoba’s life completely got changed, everything began to look reverse. Previously what he considered nectar, he began to feel it poisonous. Earlier what were the objects of enjoyment for him, now it became hard for him even to look towards them. The string of his heart began to harp another tune and the sweet tune of his heart-lyre cooled completely the melodious lamp of arrogance like the musical mode song during the rains.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mind of Shantoba completely changed. Till today, his mind remained overpowered with the passionate feelings of sensuous enjoyments and the craving of prettiest and charming ladies and gold, now, in its place such thoughts began haunting his mind that—‘Oh! I wasted the valuable time of the human life in the enjoyment of the mean objects of lust, sex and other worldly comforts. What will be my fate now? How will I get the lotus feet of Shri Hari now, I am running towards the end of my life. In a very short time, the messengers of Yamraj will take me away before the Lord of Death; what will I answer then? ‘O Lord! O the kind to the destitutes! Now, what should I do?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As soon as such noble thoughts crop up in the human mind and heart, the Lord guides him the way according to his right and worth. Despite the goal being same, paths are different due to difference in locus standi. Due to this pathetic prayer, Shantoba also came to perceive the way in the last. By the inspiration of the indwelling Lord he abandoned all the objects of worldly attachment—home-family, wealth-prosperity all. Having distributed a large portion of his immense property among the poors, chanting ‘Hari Ram’ Shantoba set out of his house. Shantoba had nothing in his possession except a loin cloth. If there had not been the sentiment of public shame, that loin cloth also would have not been with him. By walking on foot Shantoba reached the bank of the river, Bhima. Shantoba was not at all frightened to see the dreadful waves of the river. Really, why to frighten? He, who resolves to be the fearless pilgrim of the divine path to cross the ocean of worldly existences, why will he be frightened with a common river? Without any consideration overwhelmed with the emotion of love Shantoba jumped into the river and by the grace of the Lord he crossed the river and reached the next bank in the twinkling of an eye. There was a mountain on the bank of the river; without any fear Shantoba climbed on the mountain. He felt a great delightfulness to see the tranquillity and natural beauty of the mountain. In the busy and noisy city where can be possible such a peaceful solitary holy place? The charming tranquillity of the mountain peaks, tasty water of the fountains, the sweet chirping of birds charmed his mind and Shantoba determined to worship the Lord seated in the hearts of all beings staying there in the caves of the mountain.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shantoba began to live freely in this undisturbed free area like a bird out of cage or a black bee coming out of the cell of lotus petal. His joys have no bound here. To hear the chirping of birds he too, begins to chant ‘Hari-Hari’. He comes to dance to see the dance of peacock. He becomes oblivious of his own today while singing the virtues of God chiming his tune, with the tune of the cascade’s musical sound. He begins to imitate the sound with indistinct sound to hear the song of a bird or animal which adds to its charm. The entire forest land is bloomed with the nectral music of his throat. All the violent and nonviolent creatures were attracted towards him by the influence of his melodious song. Even the trees, creepers and stars as if began to stagger by dint of his love. With the association of Shantoba the entire forest land endowed with flowers and fruits began to be glamorous.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Due to the difference of taste and interest, the same object of the world which suits anybody, does not suit the other one according to his interest and mars his interest. Whereas the exile to the forest was a great source of peace for Shantoba, the same had become the cause of disturbance for the family members. The family members decided to send Shantoba’s wife to her husband in the forest. They thought that Shantoba would be charmed to see the outstanding beauty and attraction of his wife and would be back in the family. The chaste wife of Shantoba was already very eager to see the sight of her husband’s feet on any pretext. By seeking the permission of mother-in-law with a trustworthy person she started to bring her husband back. Today, that chaste wife is feeling very much delighted. She thinks to herself– ‘If he comes, I will surely bring him back, if he does not agree to come back, even then I will be gainer to have a glimpse of his sight. If he feels happy in my abdication, I, too, will feel happy in his happiness. I will not be hurdle in his pleasure. Only to see him is a great benefit for me. Pondering over thus, she reached Shantoba. Like a shy creeper bowing down her head she remained stood before her husband. A number of thoughts crossed her mind, but her throat choked and her tongue could not speak a single word.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shantoba saw his most beloved wife of outstanding beauty standing near him; but his mind was not the least tempted. There was no modification in his mind at all. He remained sitting steadfast and unmoved as it was. In this condition enough time passed; but no word came out from the mouth of the both. The chaste wife was also absorbed in deep thought. She forgot her purpose as well as motive of the family members to send her here. Instead of charming her husband with her unique beauty and to take him away back, she herself got trapped. After sometime slowly she fell down on the feet of her husband and holding his both the feet with her both hands and washing his feet with the sacred flow of her tears she said—‘Lord! You left us and came here to worship the Lord, it is alright; but my god! There is no other god for me except you. It is you only who is god for me, you are the apparent god for me. Whom should I attend leaving you? This maid has come here today to serve your lotus feet. Will you not accept her service by giving her shelter? Hardly she could speak these words that her throat choked and she could speak no word thereafter. She remained lying in the feet of her husband. Now Shantoba opened his mouth—‘Not with the sentiment of passion but with the sentiment of duty’. Shantoba said with his internal firmness—‘All right! Stay with me, but you will have to live the life as I live. You can live here without your ornaments and fashionable costly garments, in simple clothes like me, otherwise you may go back on your way. I don’t want to check you at all.’ Just hearing the words of her husband the chaste lady put off all her ornaments and garments the very moment and engaged herself in her lord’s service in the form of a female ascetic. What will be more valuable ornament than husband for a chaste woman? The ascetic husband very kindly allowed her to stay with him. What better luck could be for her? That chaste wife had never got this joy in her inner heart in the grand luxurious charming golden palaces, what she is feeling today at the feet of her husband in the desolate land of the forest of the hard mountain area. Blessed is the Indian woman!</p>
<p class="Numbers">(3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The both wife-husband began to perform penance in joy in the forest. One day, Shantoba thought to put his wife on a hard test to know how higher position she had attained in the condition of renunciation, how much she had advanced in self-restraints, what strength she had developed to bear the sufferings. So, when the couple were drinking water of cascade after eating the fruits of the forest, Shantoba said to his wife—‘O the chaste lady! A long time has passed I could not taste the bread. It would be pleasing if you go to the village and bring the loaf of bread begging from anyone.’ Just on hearing the words of the husband the chaste and faithful wife said—‘O my God! Your behest is worthy of respect. Just I go and bring begging.’ Shantoba said—‘All right! Go, but be alert not to bring anything more than the loaf of bread.’ ‘Well! As your order, saying this the faithful wife set out to beg. Oh! The chaste and faithful wife of Shantoba who was brought up with silver spoon in mouth, who had passed her life in the gynaeceum only till now, who had no experience at all yet how to beg, is the same today going to beg alms treading on the thorny paths of the mountain. Her body is today devoid of ornaments and fine garments and her hair are without the least oil but her elegance in the torn clothes and scattered hair is beyond the words to describe. Her face is glowing and glittering with the bright lustre of husband-devotion and dedication. Whosoever sees her, he salutes her treating her as the goddess of the forest. Blessed is the chastity of Indian wife.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reaching the village, this faithful woman began to  beg from door to door. While moving about by chance she happened to reach the house of her husband’s elder sister. She felt very much grieved to see her brother’s wife in the form of a beggar. Her eyes were filled with tears. Anyhow with great difficulty checking her tears she said—‘O Bhabhi (my brother’s wife)! What is your this condition before my eyes? Whether the entire property of my parents wasted?’ Hearing the words of her husband’s sister, the chaste woman related in brief the whole occurrences of her husband’s renunciation and ascetic life and said—‘Sister! I have come here leaving your brother hungry. Don’t delay and check me, if you could give me a load of bread, give me soon or I go to visit other house.’ Having said this the chaste woman became ready to go. ‘No-no stay, my oath to you, stay-stay uttering so her husband’s sister went inside the house and brought a big dish full of ‘Halva, Puri and vegetable etc. The chaste woman refused to accept all this; her husband’s sister was not ready at all to accept her refusal. In such conversation, a long time passed. My lord is sitting hungry yet’ this thought was pricking the Sati’s mind again and again, considering it proper not to waste more time, she set out taking the dish from her husband’s sister. She was moving very fast to the best of her capacity but she was unable to maintain the pace due to the fierce path. Sometimes she ran, sometimes she was slow, sometimes stumbled and fell down and then again rising up moved fast. Thus, suffering several hurdles, she reached her husband and placing the dish before him she remained stood in the wait of his command.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shantoba cast his cool sight at the dish but the very moment suppressing his calm temperament with his angry sight, he said—‘I had not instructed you to bring such a dainty dish. I had told you to bring the loaf of bread and you have brought Halva. Go and give back from where you have brought it and if you may bring piece of bread then bring it begging from door to door. Hearing the angry words of the husband, the Sati related the whole occurrences of the village and said—‘It was very much pressure of your sister that compelled me to bring these viands. Neither it was your order nor it was my will; but I had no other alternative to persuade your sister and I have to bring it, now, I am ready to do what you say.’ Even after hearing the words of his wife, Shantoba refused to eat the Halva-Puri.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(4)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shantoba had already in mind that it was a very hard test of his wife but he thought his wife’s goodness in this. Those who have firm devotion in God, leave no stone unturned in obeying the behests of God. By going high and low on the hilly path and due to other hardships of the path, the Sati was badly exhausted and had become practically lifeless. Her body was trembling and it had become hard to breathe. Even in such a critical condition the Sati did not make a single minute delay and started immediately with the dish of ‘<span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>alva-Puri’ towards the village just to obey the order of her husband. She was chaste and considered her husband like God. The only vow of her life was to accomplish her husband’s love with her mind, speech and work.*</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-11">* This description does not mean for the husbands that they are the God and the women are their slave. As there is the moral duty of a woman, likewise there is the moral duty of a husband also. A husband should treat his wife like friend and co-partner of life. He should give her the treatment of love and respect, he should not treat her like a slave and never torture her and he should never put undue pressure on her.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Sati implemented her husband’s order going to the village. Persuading her husband’s sister in sweet words, she gave back the dish and moved for begging piece of bread to the several doors and got them. Now, she moved towards the mountain very fast. Today was the test day of the Sati. She had hardly moved a little distance when the dark clouds covered the whole sky and it began to rain heavily. It had spread such a thick darkness all around that it became difficult to see one’s own hands even. In such a condition it was very difficult to move on the way. But the Sati was proceeding ahead slowly and slowly covering the piece of bread with the corner of her torn clothes. Today that piece of bread is dearer proving to be even than the parts of her body because that is the object to please her husband. Shivering with cold, the chaste wife anyhow reached the bank of the river but now it is an uphill task to move onward. The river has overflooded due to rain. Neither there looks any boat nor the face of anyone that may be the support for her to cross the river. The anxiety of the chaste wife took the more fierce form than the dreadful form of the Bhima river. The fierce waves of the river Bhima rising very high apparently outside and the most terrible waves of worry inside her, made this helpless woman afflicted excessively. ‘Now, who will rescue me in this adverse situation? ‘Who will rescue such a  helpless all alone of weaker sex like me in this misery?’ calling to herself the Sati began weeping and drawing the long breath, she said—‘Oh! Oh!’ None looks here to help me. What will be now?’ She was trembling with fear. Her teeth began to chatter due to cold. She became very impatient and began to think over—‘Oh! The evening is about to set in, my Lord would be sitting hungry and thirsty, O! How to make this piece of bread available to him? O the friend of Pandavas Lord Krishna! O the Lord! Be graceful to me only once! O the kind-hearted! O the ocean of mercy! Where are <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou? Why don’t <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou pay your attention to this maid?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just hearing the heart-touching pitiful call of the devotee, the seat (Asan) of the Lord feels shaky. As soon as the pathetic cry of the ‘Sati’ reached the ears of the Lord, the God came to her in the form of a common boatman to protect her and began to ask in sober words—‘Sister! Why have you come out of the house in such a heavy rain? Aha! Your body has faded by the excess of wetting, where do you want to go suffering such severe pain?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Sati could speak not a single word in answer, she was absorbed in the meditation of the Lord Panduranga closing her eyes. To hear the alchemy voice, she opened her eyes slowly and slowly. She sees that a boatman is standing before her. Then, having related her story and begging for mercy, the Sati said to the boatman—‘Brother! Mind it, it is the Panduranga Lord who has sent you to me, now it is you to show pity on me and if you don’t then who will show kindness to me brother? How can I cross this fierce river Bhima and reach the next bank without your mercy? Now, I will not let you free without casting your affectionate sight just like the father or the elder brother towards me. O brother! Howsoever it may come, support me to cross the river. Oh! My hungry and thirsty husband would be waiting for me sitting on the hill; if I fail to reach there he will have to go on fast.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While speaking so the Sati’s throat got choked. She remained stood like the stone statue looking towards the boatman with the piteous sight. Now, in the eyes of the saviour Lord Chudamani in the guise of a boatman the sign of grace began to reflect. He seated the Sati on His shoulders like His own daughter, brought up with a great affection and fondling, made her to cross the river in the twinkling of an eye and leaving her exactly before her husband’s hut disappeared. He did not stay even for a moment to hear the words of gratitude. What an auspicious affection to the devotee!—Blessed is Lord-devotee.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, the Sati has no sense of her body. What Sati had done really! As the rain was going on heavier, so she was covering the begged piece of bread for her husband stretching her sari. By doing so she had used her whole sari in wrapping the bread, at this time she was completely naked without any cloth on her body; but she was quite unaware of it. Reaching near her husband’s hut, as she stretched the corner of her sari to put the piece of bread before her husband, just then she came to senses. She began to grieve to herself that—‘Oh! What would have the boatman thought about me?’ She got overpowered with shame with this feeling and put on the sari removing from the bread. Then, going to her husband in the pleasant mood, she saluted her husband’s feet. The piece of bread for which this chaste wife had taken so much trouble, could not serve the purpose of Shantoba also. That piece of bread which the Sati had kept safe from the rain by wrapping it with cloth considering it dearer than her life, were put by her taking it out of the corner of her sari before her husband meekly. But Shantoba even did not look towards it, he was obsessed with something else. Since Sati came with the piece of bread, a unique peace and delight spread there. The Sati’s charm and beauty, her lustre became such divine that Shantoba remained staring towards her without a wink in wonder. He was amazed to see the wonderful change in Sati’s glamour. Oh! Shantoba! Your fortunate wife has today got the sacred touch of the annihilator of sin and evil, the charm of the entire human being, the Supreme Lord, the touch of whose tender lotus feet made the wooden boat as the boat of gold, only the touch of whose feet-dust transformed the stone rock as Ahilya, the wife of sage and the touch of whose lotus hand into the beauty queen. That is why the beautiful appearance of the Sati is looking unique somewhat new and her every limb of the body is producing the pious lustre like the current of the electricity. Being so much surprised, Shantoba asked—‘O the female ascetic! Tell me soon, how could you reach here having crossed the river in such an adverse situation?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Sati said—‘Lord! By your blessings I faced no problem at all in crossing the river. I don’t know even how I reached across the river in twinkling of an eye. Lord! By your order I went to your sister at once and by long persuation I gave back the ‘Halva-puri’. Then, moving to many houses, I collected some pieces of bread. On one side your appetite was in my mind and on the other side my mind was worried how to reach here alone. So I immediately returned. I had walked hardly a distance when it began to rain heavily. The entire path became so muddy that it was difficult to walk on it even a single step. Darkness spread over all around. Anyhow with great difficulty I reached the bank of the river. When I came there I found the river overflooded. There was neither any boat nor the trace of any man. I trembled with fear to see the waves of the river rising high to the sky. At that moment the river Bhima had assumed such a fierce form as if the Goddess of the war–Chandika were dancing on the waves for the complete annihilation assuming the garland of white foam-heads. Due to the excess of darkness, even the hands became invisible despite the sun still in the sky. The heart burst to hear the thunder of lightening, to see the flames of burning pyres on the burning grounds and heart-bursting words coming from there, to hear the loud roars of the clouds and the loud sound ‘Dhu Dhu’ of the Bhima river. Sometimes such adverse sound was heard that the whole body became as if without blood, the heart began to throb fast, the feet chained and the eyes automatically closed. Then, being helpless I began to call the supporter of the helpless and  emancipator of the downtroddens Panduranga Hari. By His grace, at the very moment abruptly a man happened to reach there. Just on his arrival my closed eyes opened. On query, I came to know that he was a boatman. His heart melted to see my miserable condition and he lifted me on his shoulders like his own daughter and seated me in the boat and on coming down from the boat on this side He made me reach here and in the twinkling of an eye he disappeared. Aha! How nectarial his words were!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The more Shantoba is listening to the words of his wife, the more he feels amazed. His heart moved to hear his wife’s last words and his eyes were flooded with tears. After a while he said to his wife with choking throat—‘O the lucky one! Will you not favour me to have glimpse of that boatman only once? Goddess! My sole purpose of sitting here in the desolate forest is only to get His glimpse.’ While uttering these word Shantoba was overwhelmed with emotion, the tears began to overflow; he called loudly—‘Lord! Did you start feeling tired to appear before me even after coming to the door? Alright! Sati! Feed these pieces of bread to the birds and animals, I will not take even water till that Boatman provides me His sight? I will wait and see how long He does not appear. Aha! Sati! You are blessed. Today, you attained the invaluable gain of the touch of the great merciful Lord’s limbs. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Obeying the command of her husband the Sati fed the pieces of bread to birds and animals. Shantoba has eaten nothing till now. How can the chaste husband- devotee eat anything without her husband taking food? Both, the wife and husband began to meditate on God melodiously with mind being in the agony of separation remaining hungry.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Several days of Shantoba’s fast passed on. In the village a God-devotee Vaishya lived there. The Lord instructed him in the dream that on the mountain His devotee, Shantoba along with his wife was on fast for many days. Grab the great fruit of noble deed by convincing him to take food anyhow. Just when the devotee Vaishya got up from the sleep, he got many kinds of sweets prepared according to the instruction of the Lord and with these sweets he went to Shantoba and there, first he saluted Shantoba and uttered with folded hands– ‘Mahatma! This slave has brought some food objects for you as per the direction of the Lord, kindly, accept and take it.’ On his query the devotee Vaishya related the whole story of the dream to Shantoba.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just hearing his words, Shantoba became impatient and he began to utter with tears—‘Brother! Whoever you may be and whosoever might have sent you, but I will not taste your food so long as you make me to see the sight of that sender.’ The Vaishya made his request by all means; but Shantoba remained firm on his resolve. The poor Vaishya ultimately, feeling helpless saluted Shantoba’s feet, went on way back to his home. The objects of food remained lying there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the devotee Vaishya had gone away, Shantoba began to say casting his look on the food objects—‘My Lord! Why should I take the food—good for nothing? Should I forget You in the temptation of the objects which are to be changed into the form of excrement after a little while of eating, should I attach myself to the worldly objects of enjoyment leaving the nectar of Your love? No, Lord! No, it will never be so. But my Lord! How hard-hearted or cruel You are! I weep, I lament, I wail! Even then Your heart does not melt. Lord! Give me the glimpse of Your sight. Lord! Show me Your glimpse. O the Lord of my heart! Give me the view of Your glimpse. Lord! What should I urge you again and again, You are well acquainted with the condition of my heart and my mental agony. Only once my Lord! Show me your charming glimpse!’ Having uttered this, Shantoba began to weep bitterly. The omniscient Lord heard his cry this time. Now, the Lord could not tolerate the devotee’s mental agony. He appeared before Shantoba that very moment. At the first sight of Shyamsundar’s humbling, outstanding, sweet and pleasant charming appearance, the destroyer of cupid’s ego; Shantoba was mad in rapture. Today, the boundless joy of his heart in the form of ocean began to cross its limit. It is not known how long Shantoba took the nectareal drink of Lord’s appearance which is beyond the description in words, yet he remained unsatiated. He who gets even the shadow of that outstanding and unique glimpse only once, becomes mad after it. There is such an uncommon spell-bound charm in it. While drinking the nectar of Lord’s beauty, Shantoba’s hunger and thirst of many days vanished away. Sometimes he saluted His feet and sometimes began to dance in rapture; sometimes he rubbed his body with feet-dust rolling on it, sometimes he sang softly to himself and sometimes sat down silently. Sometimes he laughed and sometimes wept, sometimes restless and sometimes he sang in joy. But he was not at all aware of what he was doing. By the mercy of the kind-hearted God his tongue became active to dance, but his throat choked and he could not utter a single word. He tried his best, made many prayers in his mind but he remained speechless. After a little while he got some strength to speak in the indistinct voice something. The sacred water of the holy river of the devotional sentiments created in his mind, began to flow. Shantoba began to praise the virtues of the Lord; there started the rain of nectar in all the direction by the hymn at the glory of the glorious Supreme Lord. Shantoba changed the entire surroundings into nectareal atmosphere. The Lord was very much pleased to see the devotee’s pure spirit of devotion and blessing Shantoba with his kind grace disappeared.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, Shantoba’s condition was somewhat strange as if he was lying in the rapture of such a bliss which cannot be described in words. In the meditation of the Lord of the universe he was so much absorbed that he had no sense of his ownself as well as of the surroundings. Since now, Shantoba engaged himself in the worship of the controller of the universe with his mind, speech and body. His virtuous wife was also helping him in all the activities and proved herself a worthy wife.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sacred and pleasant fragrance of the scented flowers of the Lord’s devotion, blossomed in the pious heart of the saint Shantoba and his wife spread far and wide in the whole world. The internal peace of Shantoba’s mind did not remain confined only to the limit of his own heart, hundreds and thousands of men and women began to take its benefit. From time to time Shantoba used to flow the stream of devotional sentiments in the hearts of the householders by his virtuous sermons going to them for begging. One day, he reached a Brahman’s house to beg. The Brahman was out somewhere. The lady Brahmin was there in the house. She gave the alms to the saint with due respect and also expecting the alms of his grace she said humbly—‘Maharaj! <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>y lord usually comes to quarrel with me without any reason from time to time and tortures me often and threatens to attend your service having abandoned me. Lord! if he leaves me and goes away anywhere then what will be the condition of a helpless like me, I remain always mentally agonised and restless with this thought, I tell him nothing, I obey his all the orders, even then how is my fate that he always remains displeased with me. O the kind-hearted! I want nothing. I want that my Lord should not remain wrathful with me and his heart may be holy. So, be graceful to me to bless me only with this boon.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To hear the words of the lady Brahmin consoling her Shantoba said—‘Mother! ‘Don’t worry. I will try to find out the way to remove your trouble. Do one thing, if the Brahman threatens you further to come to me, allow to let him come to me gladly. When he comes to me, the very day, I will mould him in such a way that he will forget completely to quarrel again.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After uttering so, Shantoba went away. One day, it was a bit late in cooking. The Brahman became furious and began to say as in the past—‘Well enough! <span class="char-style-override-7">n</span>ow, I am unable to bear the affliction of everyday. I just go to the hermitage of Shantoba Maharaj. I will pass my life peacefully there.’ Today, the lady Brahman also did not keep quiet jingling she said—‘Why do you threaten me daily, if you want to go, it matters little, you may go. When am I going to check you?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The Brahman was in habit of saying whatever suited his tongue. To hear the point blank reply of his wife, was the first chance for him so he took his wife’s words very seriously and took it very ill and being agitated, he at once set out from the house with a blanket and a brass pot. He had a strong body. There was excitement already in his mind, so the Brahman reached the Shantoba’s hermitage in no time very soon.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By running continuously, he was breathing fast. He was hungry of the whole day, so his mouth got parched, he had lost even the strength to speak. After taking rest for a while, having saluted the feet of Shantoba, the Brahman said—‘Maharaj! There is daily quarrel in my family. I have bitter relation with my wife. Now, I am completely fed up with this world and I have come in your shelter for peace. O the kind-hearted! Please guide me the path of peace. Shantoba, at once, presumed that the Brahman was the husband of the same lady Brahman. Then, consoling the Brahman Shantoba uttered in sweet words—‘Brother! <span class="char-style-override-7">i</span>t is good that you have renounced, but these garments, this blanket and this brass pot are of no use for an ascetic. First, abandon them and fetch the water from the nearing waterfall filling this bitter-gourd and wash your hands and feet with the water and then take rest.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman’s excitement had yet not cooled, so he threw away his garments, blanket and brass pot at once and put on a loin cloth the very moment. He moved towards the cascade with the bitter-gourd in his hands to fetch water. The Brahman is hungry of the whole day. He has reached the hermitage from his house running away. So, he is feeling appetite extremely, his eyes are heavy, the body is burning, while coming out from the house leaving the prepared food, he had thought that he was departing from the house empty of stomach that did not matter as he would get the food to full of his stomach just reaching the hermitage of the Mahatmaji and the kind-hearted Swamiji would allow him to dwell with him, seeing his miserable condition. But when he reached there he found just opposite. To get the food was the matter of far away. Contrary to it Swamiji asked him, to fetch the water. ‘Oh! What a great trouble is, now it is unbearable to remain without food’—These words automatically came out of the Brahman’s mouth and he began to feel starvation again and again. The excitement of renunciation began to cool down slowly and slowly. So, his legs failed to move. There was burning the fire of hunger in the stomach, how long could stay the artificial renunciation?’ With great trouble the Brahman, anyhow reached the hermitage with the water. Reaching there he finds that Shantoba and his wife are taking food. His patience now lost its limit. Due to the strict oppression of starvation, he lost his shame also. Anyhow putting down the water container forcibly on the ground, he said—‘Maharaj! I am feeling unbearable appetite, kindly give me something to eat very soon.’ The Brahman began to ask for food with excess of eagerness pressing his stomach with one hand and showing his faded face with the next hand. Shantoba gave him some fruits. Now, the Brahman’s mood was out of control. How could some fruits appease his burning fire of hunger, abruptly he shouted loudly—‘Alas! I am your guest dying of hunger and you are avoiding me by giving some fruits.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing the condition of the Brahman, Shantoba was pained to himself undoubtedly but side by side he could not check himself to laugh also on his folly. After sometime he said to the Brahman—‘Brother! Isn’t it that you have choosen the ascetic life? If you have so much temptation for eating and drinking, how will you live a ascetic’s life? Brother! Austerity is very difficult, you should remain contented with whatever you get. An ascetic should never feel dissatisfied whether he gets less or more.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing these words of Shantoba, Brahmana’s entire feeling of renunciation vanished. Repenting for his action he made up his mind to return home and began to say to himself, ‘I don’t need such a renunciation of starvation. My home was certainly better than this renunciation.’ Having uttered so, he set off to take his blanket, garments and brass pot; but what he sees that nothing of it is there. There was no trace of his brass pot and instead some torn pieces of blanket and clothes were flying in the air. When the Brahman had gone to fetch the water, Shantoba had made such arrangement in his absence. This plot had been contrived to set right this pseudo renunciant on the charge of torturing his wife without any reason.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shantobaji’s plan worked. When the Brahman had to lose his ram and clothes, his sorrow had no limit. Already he had the distress of hunger besides this, this misery added more to his worry. He could no longer tolerate and burst to tears like a small child. Now, he experienced completely the hardship of renunciation. With tears in his eyes he said to Shantoba—‘Maharaj! If I had been at my home, my wife would have provided me food to eat at least twice to thrice. Now, I have come to realise my foolishness very well. But I had come here having quarrelled with her without any reason, how and with which face should I go before her now? Where to appease the hunger of my stomach? Oh! Be graceful at least to tell me.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shantoba said—‘Brother! The path of renunciation is very troublesome. Self-restraint is highly needed to tread on this road. He who is disturbed or begins to shed tears in the triffling matters of sorrow, cannot adopt austerity. One can follow the path of renunciation only with true firmity and sincere carefulness. Brother! You don’t have that worth yet. So, only householder’s life is good for you. Going back to your home fulfil the domestic duties. There lies your welfare. If you do so, all kinds of hunger are appeased, if you do your moral duty, your human birth will prove to be worthful. Well! I just accompany you to your home and persuade your wife and manage everything in such a way as she will give you a very good treatment.’ After this Shantoba accompanied the Brahman to his house and having solved the problem of quarrel between the wife-husband while returning he said to the Brahman— ‘Mind it never to quarrel with your wife without any reason. By the grace of Shri Hari your family life will be very peaceful and happy.’ The couple saluted the saint Shantoba. Shantoba came back to his hermitage, Then after the husband-devotee Brahman lady provided food to her husband with due respect. Having eaten to full of his stomach, he felt contentment and decided never to think of renunciation in future quarrelling with such a wife.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the South, Pandharpur is a famous holy place of Pilgrimage. That is called the ‘heaven of earth’. On every ‘Ekadashi’ the assemblage of the devotees is held. On this occasion hundreds and thousands of the groups of devotees gather here and on ‘Asharhi Ekadashi’ this number goes in lacs and all the ten directions are resounded with the chanting of the Lord’s name. Once, Shantoba also thought to share this divine joy going to Pandharpur on the ‘Ekadashi’ day. Shantoba along with his wife and a few Brahmans with a band with musical instruments, raining the divine nectar in the dry land of devotion, bereft of chanting Name of ‘Shri Hari-Ram’ set out. Repeating divine names, he reached the village named Narsinghpur. It was the ‘Dashami’ night. There is a river between Pandharpur and Narsinghpur. The river was flooded due to heavy rain. Its horrible waves were rising high to the sky. Neither there was any boat nor any boatman even. There was no other means except to swim to cross the river; but to see the horrifying sight of the river except Shantoba and his wife none had dare to go near the river. It was the ‘Dashami’ night, ‘Ekadashi’ is just the next day. The Lord should be worshipped reaching Pandharpur at the break of the morning, so it is necessary to cross the river at this very time. Shantoba saw that all were frightened to see the furious waves of the river, so encouraging them, he said—‘You got so much frightened only to see these few waves of this small river! Why are you getting frightened so much when ‘Shri Hari’, whose name only enables the living being to cross the ocean of this world, is our supporter. Having offered your all the worries to the lotus feet of that ‘Chintamani’, roaring His name follow me fearlessly that’s all. Don’t think of life and death. Proceed, with the roar of ‘Shri Hari-Ram’, let the river water and the universe tremble.’ Having uttered these encouraging words resounding ‘Hari-Hari’ Shantoba jumped into the river with fearless mind. The chaste wife also followed her husband chanting the name of ‘Hari’. After the couple, all the Brahmans also followed them resounding ‘Shri Hari’ and jumped into the river. In the chanting name of the ‘Hari’, they were so much obsessed that nobody had body- consciousness. An excellent lustre of joy came over their heart. The holy loud sound of ‘Shri Hari’s name resounded in all the ten directions. There was an unique gravitation power in the chanting of Hari’s name coming out of the pure and simple heart of devotees. By the influence of that force, end had to come there. The affection of the affectionate God for his loving devotees is famous in the whole universe. In the twinkling of an eye, a path was created in the middle of the river. Now, there remained no difficulty in reaching across the river. How and why can any hurdle be created in the way of the person who depends fully on the support of Shri Hari and the Lord ‘Shri Hari’ Himself is his supporter? The fruit of firm faith in God is always supernatural like this. Today, it was the same influence of the Lord that Shantoba along with his all companions crossed that fierce river in the deep darkness of the night without any effort. What is the meaning of crossing this small river to get the support of the clever sailor who has the power to provide deliverance from the ocean of this world?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Before the sun-rise all began to chant divine name of Lord Hari joyfully reaching Pandharpur. After day break all of them took bath in the river ‘Shri Chandrabhaga’. Then after having worshipped the devotee Pundarik all went to get the glimpse of Lord Vitthal. For the sake of Pundarik God Panduranga had incarnated. So, at Pandharpur, Pundarik is worshipped first. All were overjoyed by getting the sight of ‘Shri Vitthalnathji’. Shantoba being unconscious of the body was mad in rapture. The Sattvic sentiments of love developed in his body. He began to laugh sometime, weep sometime, cry sometime and dance sometimes.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At last, with tears in his eyes in a very pathetic tone praying to the Lord he said—‘My deity! It was Your inspiration that I had abandoned the domestic life. Lord! Now, be graceful never to forget this slave. Never give up this slave after giving the generous support of Your lotus feet. Shyamsunder! Your glory is boundless. Despite the praise of <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our virtues day and night with his one thousand mouths Sheshnag could not approach Your limit. Lord! By <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our grace, I am today fulfilled, now, my Lord! Bless me so that I may remain in Your lotus feet forever. Appoint me in the category of Your slaves remaining always with You, My Lord!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While speaking so Shantoba’s consciousness was no more. The Lord’s kindness is beyond limit. Lord never abandon him who surrenders himself with his sincere heart to His feet. At the first instance, it is difficult to turn towards Him, but once after being turned towards Him, He at once adopts him forever and the saviour of all the three worlds of the universe gives him place in His sacred feet. Shantoba saw through his divine sight that the Lord Shri Vitthal was present in the temple of his heart and with mild smile He commands that—‘My favourite devotee! Stay here, to see you in this condition I am feeling much delighted today. When I see <span class="char-style-override-7">m</span>y dear devotees in the condition of madness in love, I feel overjoyed beyond the description in the words.’ Blessed is Lord!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to the will of the Lord, Shantoba along with his wife began to live there at Pandharpur. His rest life passed in the intoxication of devotional love.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">Devotee–Nilamberdas</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Between sensuality and spirituality—what is more fascinating? In its answer most of the people assert that sensuality is more fascinating. It is but natural for the men like us, who are badly attached to the worldly objects, but the seers of truth do not find any substance in this assertion. They are acquainted with the fact that when a man wanders about inquest of God, crying the Lord’s name like a mad, ignoring the objects of his surroundings and even quite oblivious of himself due to some unknown reason, at that moment no object of the world can attract him towards it. Thus, the God has power to make us to forget the self-sentiment, that is why He is called ‘Bhuwanmohan’ (charmer to the universe). Fortunately the men who become attached to His charm and are attracted towards Him, only they know His charming power. The common men like us were yet not attracted towards Him. So, we have failed to know His charm, in the real sense. But those lucky men who have experience of His charm can enlighten us also with the unlimited charm of the Lord if we associate with them. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee Nilamberdas’s luck has no limit. He has been attracted towards the ‘Bhuwanmohan’ being fascinated by His charm and he has come to realize His enchanting power. Nilamberdas was happy in all respects; he had his wife, son, wealth and there was his full family, he had everything, repute, honour etc. But the moment he got attached to the Lord being attracted with the single charm of Mohan, since that moment the bindings of all the objects of the world became loose. He began to feel himself attached and bound with the mystic bindings of wife, son, self, repute etc., and began to consider his life worthless passing the time worthlessly to live with them. This thought began to haunt his mind again and again and at last he decided to set out having abandoned the domestic life at all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This thought did not only occur in his mind like the ambitions of a destitute and proved smoke in the air but this resolve made him a true ascetic and true renunciant. Oh! If it were not so, then what extremely charming power god possesses? </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having left the house with restless mind Nilamberdas set out on the way to Shri Jagannathji. He was extremely impatient for the sight of the Lord. He was in the condition of a child separated from his affectionate mother. As a small child weeps to remember his mother, similarly Nilamberdas’s mind constantly remained concentrated in the memory of the Lord and he used to weep bitterly for Him. Remembering the Lord he was moving very fast anyhow to reach Jagannathpuri very soon. He was unaware of the directions; as well as of eating, drinking and sleeping. Closing his eyes, remembering the Lord and staggering, he was proceeding onward. Such is the madness of a lover to meet his beloved. Shri Jagannathpuri was not close to the village of Nilamberdas. His house was situated in the Northern part of the state and Jagannathpuri was situated in the <span class="char-style-override-7">s</span>outhern part of the state. But he had no consciousness of anything except walking. Thus, passing through many mountains-hills, rivers-streams and hard desolate forests he reached the bank of Gangaji. It was rainy season, Gangaji was growing flooded; no bank was visible. one could not muster courage even to see the rising waves of the Gangaji; just to see it the heart trembled with fear. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nilamberdas has to go across the river. Without boat there is no way to cross the river, but the boat is not visible anywhere at all. Nilamberdas got perturbed in his mind. His grief was boundless at this moment. He was coming passing through many villages and forests. He was badly exhausted. The Sun was about to set. So it was necessary to reach across the river instantly. But the place where he was standing was beyond the thought  of any settlement, there was no trace of any man even. At such a deserted place there was none to query about the ferry. In such a situation there was no other alternative but to remember the Lord Shri Hari. Nilamberdas began to remember the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sometime passed chanting divine name. In the meantime a fisherman reached there while throwing the net into the river to catch the fish with his boat. Nilamberdas was very much pleased to see him. He began to express his gratitude to the Lord and calling the boatman he began to say—‘O brother! Kindly bring your boat to this side and oblige this Brahman in misery to help him to cross the river. Don’t worry for money. After crossing the river whatever you demand, will be given to you certainly. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The fisherman sailed his boat towards the bank hearing the words of Nilamberdas. He boarded Nilamberdas on the boat speaking in sweet voice. Just as boarding on the boat Nilamberdas’s joys had no bound. He began to express his many many obligations to the Lord in his mind. On the other hand the fisherman also was very much pleased to board Nilamberdas on his boat and began to express his thanks to God. There was difference between the thanks of the both. Nilamberdas was restless to get a glimpse of the Lord very soon; in such a condition the Lord managed to send the boat to cross the Ganga. He was expressing his gratitude to the Lord and the fisherman was feeling obliged to the God to get a helpless and weak person under his clutches considering him his prey. He had made up his mind to kill Nilamberdas in the middle of the river and rob his all the belongings whatever he had, so he was puffed up with joy in his mind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The poor foolish fisherman did not understand that all the possessions of Nilamberdas was not in the bag of his shoulder but it was in such a secret bag of the heart which could not be stolen by anyone. How could it be possible for him to apprehend the real condition of Nilamberdas? He began to sail the boat towards the mid of the river considering him a common passanger with the money-bag wandering about, with the purpose of robbing him. To see the fisherman sailing the boat to the other direction instead of the bank side, Nilamberdas said—‘Brother! You look to be very courageous; otherwise who can dare to bring the boat into the mid current of the river in such a stormy situation; but brother! Now the Sun is about to set, it is better to reach the bank before sun-set. So, sail the boat towards the bank side. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But who was going to listen to him? Really, the fisherman had the intention otherwise, so he continued sailing the boat in the middle of the river. In the reply of Nilamberdas he turned his face smiling. Nilamberdas at once understood his evil mind, to see this mental attitude of the fisherman. First he got perturbed a little; but it is not good to feel perturbed at such a time; Thinking so, with firm faith in God he said boldly with courage— ‘Brother! What is your motive, do you want to kill me? Very good! I will also see how you kill me!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To hear the words of Nilamberdas the fisherman laughed loudly and said seriously—‘Oh! You seem to be a great fanatic, but your death is close, well! It is only a matter of time. Well! Now, remember whom you want to remember, just the moment I make you reach the next world.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nilamberdas heard the words of the fisherman, he felt a little disturbed with some doubt. It was not the disturbance of death; it was the worry of death prior to seeing the sight of the Lord. He began to remember the supporter of unsupported and the strength of helpless, Ram with a concentrated mind. He said—‘O Lord! O kind hearted! Protect me, Protect me. The past is evidence that you have removed the distress of so many shelter-seeking, today relieve this shelter-seeking Brahman also from this misery. Protect this distressed one lying in the ocean of misery by the boat of Your grace! Lord! Save! Once after seeing Your sight whatever may be but save me from death before viewing <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our sight.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The affectionate to devotee the Lord heard the cry of the afflicted devotee. To know the internal affliction of the Brahman just the same moment in the form of a young brave Rajput, God appeared on the bank of the Ganges and began to say calling the fisherman in a loud voice— ‘O the fisherman! come towards this side. If you want to save your life, come here immediately, make hurry to sail the boat on the bank. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sound of Shri Hari’s throat was not a common one, just hearing this the fisherman felt lost, his body began to tremble with fear, it became hard to sail the boat, even then, he continued sailing slowly and slowly turning a deaf ear. Then, the Lord again gave a loud call; but when he did not pay any heed, at last an arrow with hissing sound came and knocked at the boat. With the roar of the bow the fisherman was perturbed and as if his eyes began to burn with the divine brightness of the arrow. He began to think over—‘Oh! Oh! What will be now? If the Brahman discloses the secret then he will finish me. But not to sail the boat to the bank is also not safe as he will kill me with his arrow.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thinking this cries he turned the boat towards the bank and reaching there rolled down at the feet of the Rajput brave. Nilamberdas was wonder-struck to see and hear this. He was confused whether it was a dream or truth. Then, the illusive <span class="char-style-override-7">k</span>shatriya brave rebuking the fisherman said in wrath—‘Wicked! I remain always constantly watchful moving here and arrest the plunderers like you. Tell me how should I treat you, if I separate your head from the body who will save you?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To hear the frolicsome words of the Lord the fisherman became lifeless. He remained lying in his feet like dead; Then, being calm the Lord began to say to Nilamber in humble words—‘O Brahman! Get down from the boat. Do you know who am I? I am the watchman of this area and I protect this bank and the orchard of this forest. I stay here only to give the proper punishment to him who tortures anyone, robs the passengers and kills him robbing his wealth. I have assumed this bow and arrow in this form only to protect the travellers from the wickeds.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To hear the words of the Lord in the form of Kshatriya youth, Nilamberdas began to say—‘Brother! I was great fortunate today that I could get Your appearance. It is You to save me from the jaws of death. So, I realize Your obligation. My innerself is afflicted at present for the sight of Shri Jagannathji; So having sacrificed everything I have set out, so, kindly, guide me the way to cross the river so that I may take a view of ‘Shri Nilachalnath’ (exceedingly dear).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Oh Brahman! Your heart-lord and your life-breath is just standing before you; It is He whom you are talking with. Could you not recognise Him still? Yes, how could you recognise Him still? None can recognise Him unless He introduces Himself. Without His grace, without His will, it is impossible to realize Him despite all the Jap-tap and Yoga (meditation, penance and Yagya) these all prove worthless even the crores of methods are adopted but He cannot be recognised. <span class="char-style-override-12">‘सोइ जानइ जेहि देहु जनाई।’ </span>‘Only he can know Him whom He favours to know.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said to hear the words of Nilamberdas—‘O the Brahman! When you have given up your house for the glimpse (darshan) of Shri Jagannathji, your desire can never remain unfulfilled. The Lord of the universe will protect you and support you. It is a little matter to cross this petty river, you have now become worthy deliverance from the world-sea very easily.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After giving assurance to Nilamberdas, the Lord said to the fisherman—‘To remain lying here like dead is not good for you. Rise up, support this Brahman to cross the river and make him reach the opposite bank of the river. Making him reach there infront of me and then come, otherwise, look here at my bow.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To hear these words of the Lord in the form of Kshatriya, the fisherman as if came to his life. Instantly rising up, he began to salute the Lord and began to beg pardon for his crime. At last, boarding Nilamberdas in his boat he sailed the boat. Now, the fisherman’s mind completely changed He has no ill will at all in his mind. Now, he does not utter any bitter word from his mouth. By the sight of the Lord his all the vices have turned to virtues and so he is sailing the boat singing the holy name of Shri Hari. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the twinkling of an eye the boat reached the opposite bank of the Gangaji. Nilamberdas got down from the boat; on the other hand, the Lord also disappeared. The fisherman is filled with the feeling of remorse. He began to beg for pardon rolling down in the feet of Nilamberdas. Nilamberdas moved ahead gladly having blessed him. Passing through several villages, cities, mountains, forests, rivers and streams, after some days he reached Shri Jagannathpuri.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By chance, that was the day of ‘Rathyatra’. The whole Puri was overwhelmed with joy and excitement. The uproar of ‘Hari-Hari’ and ‘Jai-Jai’ was resounding in the entire sky. The whole city was pervaded with musical sounds and the sweet melodious songs full of nectar, soothing to the ears sung by the charming ladies. The dance and congregational singing were going on without stoppage. To any corner where the ears were alert, it happened to hear the uproar of merriment and to any corner where one cast a glance, there looked the sight of exhilaration and sea of joy. Shri Balram, Shri Subhadra and Shri Jagannathji all the three were present in three separate excellent chariots. The devotees are pulling the chariots very gladly and all the three chariots are moving with deep roars. The attendants are dancing raising their both the hands and calling ‘Manima! Manima!!’. The people are jumping, clapping their hands in excitement of joy. Some are raining the tears and some have become still-motionless. At the same time Nilamberdas came to reach near the chariot. Today his joys have no bound; there is continuous flow of the tears of joy from his eyes. He forgot all the hardships of hunger, thirst, heat, cold etc., what he had suffered on the way of the long journey. This is the glory of the consecration with the pious tears of love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being absorbed in the devotional love of Shri Jagannathji, Nilamberdasji expressed his inner feelings before the Lord. The devotee and the Lord, pleasing to the devotee looked into the eyes of each other and some secret understanding was made and just in the twinkling of an eye, the devotee Nilamberdas fell down before the chariot of the Lord. To see him fallen down, the attendants rushed up to him and they see that he had passed away. The bird which was chanting a moment before <span class="char-style-override-12">‘हरे कृष्ण राम राम हरे कृष्ण राम राम’</span><span class="char-style-override-13"> </span> (Hare Krishna Ram Ram, Hare Krishna Ram Ram) these words, flew away, God knows where. Undoubtedly he would have reached the Supreme abode of the Lord. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nilamberdas’s death news spread all around. To hear his death occurrence all were surprised and began to praise his rare death and felt envious of this death. Oh! What a great glory of the devotee is! Their death even becomes immortal in this mortal world. Even today, the applausive sound of his death is heard from place to place in Jagannathpuri. </p>
<p class="Chapter-End-Text"><span class="char-style-override-6">Cheers hailing the victory to God and his devotee.</span></p>
