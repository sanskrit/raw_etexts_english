## CXX

(Translated from [Bengali](b8549e5120.pdf) )

GOPAL LAL VILLA,  
BENARES (VARANASI) CANTONMENT,  
*24th February, 1902*.

This morning I got a small American parcel sent by you. (Swami
Brahmananda) I have received no letter, neither the registered one you
refer to nor any other. Whether the Nepalese gentleman came and what
happened — I have not been able to know anything at all about it. To
write a simple letter so much trouble and so much delay! . . . Now I
shall be relieved if I get the accounts. That also I get who knows after
how many months! . . .

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
