<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">Preface</p>
<p class="Text">May our life remain like the fragrant flowers, may our fragrant life be the source of the fragrance of other lives and by the fondling love and the motivation of courage let them stimulate to progress onward. Man has been blessed with the opportunity of a limited and unknown span of life. The fragrance exists in this life only for a very short period; so this life should be spent in the most decent manner. It is not humanity to pass this life in complication, unrest and troubles. If everyone lives one’s own life dedicately and fragrantly by helping others to live a healthy life, then only the goal of human life will be achieved and the divine motive for the creation of the world will be fulfilled; otherwise not.</p>
<p class="Text">The human personality is more profound, still and serene than even ocean. It contains genius, sharpness and radiance like the Sun. Its depth and talent are unmeasurable, self-confidence and skill and art. Human being is the highest envolved creature. If his entire potency comes out abruptly, it can create up heaval in the whole world. If so desires, he can enlighten the whole world with enlightenment. The possibility of all around prosperity and progress is present in the human body, mind and soul, but he achieves them by the constant prowess and efforts. We are blessed with the human life so because we may make allround development of our personality and spread our fragrance in all the corners of the whole garden (universe). </p>
<p class="Text">Life is struggle, only those who are able to prove the excellence of their prowess and valour get victory. A river succeeds in reaching the sea when it maintains its constant competence to make its flow go ahead dashing against rock¦ The river lacks this competence remains limited like any pond or lake. Where is the opportunity materialise the dream of progress in reality?</p>
<p class="Text">A man has to climb on the tall tree of the difficulties to pluck the nectar fruit of success. He has to move on the high peaks of the troubles and miseries of various kinds. Those who lose their patience and courage to see the height, have to return empty-handed. But the heros who challenge the dangers and go on proceeding onward tumbling down the hardships, sufferings and antagonism, obtain a lot of on this very earth. The golden part of the successful eminent persons of the world has bloomed on account of their guts only.</p>
<p class="Text">This is the God’s will that we should adopt the various virtues what the Lord, Himself possesses. We should develop in ourselves the divine property what we call morality and humanity. The huge structure of religion and culture has been built so because we may create the faith in our mind impressed by them to live a restrained life of noble conduct. The main motive of theism and divine justice is that ‘man should realize the control of invisible power over him and may not dare to think of doing ill and immoral work even secretly, not only with body but even in thought also.’ Self-restrain is the root of nobility. The self-restrain and self-refinement are necessary so because the man should learn gentility and generosity towards his kins as well as others. This is the royal path to become a social animal in true sense. To follow the rules of sociability is the only way to safeguard the individual and Cosmic prosperity and peace—to maintain to remain progressive only. Self-control is the root of nobility. </p>
<p class="Text">Man has formed the society only to enrich his life with pleasures, comforts and means; and not to make his life thorny. When he first started to live having formed a society, he remained constantly prompt for the mutual co-operation. Mostly he used to be unselfish and detached. The feeling of sympathy, compassion and co-existence prevailed in his heart. This was the basic cause of his happy life. It was so when man was not civilized and well educated as today.</p>
<p class="Text">Then, what is the reason today when the man is so advanced in his social thought, he is leading his life in such a pitiable and frightened condition? Why has he become so that he is finding out the shortcomings in the humanenss and righteousness? Why are the people of the same society engaged in exploiting and torturing one another? </p>
<p class="Text">There is its reason—‘Man’s attitude today has become selfish hoarding.’ Today the man wants to a amass all the objects of the world for himself only. If in the society, the general delight, means prosperity and pleasant circumstances are to be brought, the man today boasting of being cultured, will have to be free from the lust of selfish motive. The allround prosperity and pleasure of all in the whole society is possible only on giving up this lust. It is the selfishness of mankind that has led to the doom of the world.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Man is the architect of his own fate</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord has constituted the body, mind and spirit of the mankind very skillfully. Each and every nerve, organ and pulse has been fitted very carefully. He has blessed every organ of this body with unlimited immence power secretly. Well! Our duty is only to know it and develop it patiently. In my opinion, abundance of objects are lying hidden in us to prosper and glorify the life. The wonderful power of courage, vigour, industry, labour, effort, patience and struggle are created  by our positive and creative thoughts and we take its advantage in the practical field of our active life. If we don’t pay attention to our hidden talent and spiritual power, we will remain poor, weak being and distressed. </p>
<p class="Text">The braves only deserve the enjoyment of earthly enjoyable objects, but the question is to make our life deligent. Nothing will come to our hands if there is no prowess. </p>
<p class="Text">Veda has said— </p>
<p class="Shlok">कृतं मे दक्षिणे हस्ते जयो मे सव्य आहित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">गोजिद् भूयासमश्वजिद् धनंजयो हिरण्यजित्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-2">Atharva.</span> 7/ 50/8)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Mankind! Do the valorous acts with your right hand and the success lies in the left hand.’ Amass the wealth of cows, horses, gold and all the other kinds of wealth by your self-efforts and labour.’</p>
<p class="Text">It is true that only the lion-hearted men of firm determination and constant striver have brought unique revolutions in the world. The circumstances could not overpower them by any way.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Hardships are the test of your prowess</p>
<p class="Text">A valorous man should greet the difficulties instead of giving in before them. They should consider them the honourable chapter of the school of their life. All the progressive minded persons of the world have been educated by the teachings of difficulties. Their minds having been developed by themselves, have been able to expand the knowledge and science to this high limit. If the life remains empty of difficulties, troubles, calamities, hardships and hard labour, man’s life will become completely inactive and full of disappointment.</p>
<p class="Text">Well! What is charm of utter disappointed, inactive, and disillusioned life?</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever the hue and cry, hustle and bustle in the world, whatever the motion and progress is, whatever the life is that is all due to the protection of the life from the difficulties and to beat them and to fight them.</p>
<p class="Text">Greet the difficulties considering them inevitable part and parcel of the progress of life—accept their challenge and overcome them even suffering hundreds of hardships to any kind of calamity. This is your prowess, this is the only way of your success and progress. Difficulties are not your opponents only but they are your friends too; they are the cause to advance you to go ahead on the path of progress. The single blow of disaster changes and improves even the most damaged and spoiled men. The experiences of those men who have been trained in the school of hardships and who have passed through, are invaluable and useful.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Live the life with great zeal</p>
<p class="Text">Grow like seed and remain progressing constantly like creeper going higher and higher. Mind it, human life is meant to live the life of exhilaration and enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="Text">Generally, everyone lives the life, but is there anyone to say confidently that really he is leading his life properly? I mean by living a life is to lead the life full of elation. </p>
<p class="Text">A life in real sense is an enthusiastic life, an optimistic life, lively life. Let us live a life which is not only dear to self rather than it should be fondling and darling to others also, it should be invaluable, ideal and motivational to all and sundry.</p>
<p class="Text">But what is the secret art that may make us to live such an exhilarated life? That art is very simple. Neither it requires any penance nor the practice of Yoga. Even in the usual course of life, the art of the life of exhilaration will be proved itself.</p>
<p class="Text">That art is to live for others, to live for the poors, downtrodden and weak, to live for the interest of the human beings and the prosperity of humanity, to live for the world sake. When we live for others, our life will be the life of others, all will begin to love him and all the doors of self-contentment will be opened.</p>
<p class="Text">The successful life means to live for any goal with a definite strategy. Do the works for others more than you do for yourself. Keep yourself away from the worthless disasterous doings. The more deeply the life is pondered over, the more complicated it will become. Really, the matter of consideration should be why the certain work was done by me? Talk less, do more. This is the best means for success.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Bravo!</p>
<p class="Text">When some tread on their way, by the staggering motion of their steps, the earth feels burdensome. When some proceed on their way, due to the seismic inspiration, the path runs calling—‘O the wayfarer! I have extended a red carpet reception in your wait.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Prof. Ramcharan Mahendra is the wayfarer of the same type. He moved ahead on the path of literature and the success ran after him giving call; because the wonder-box of his literature is not the scent of the sky-blossom or the woman dance of the fancy-copious enjoyment. He has the infallible sight of the judgement of life. His literature is imbued with the throbbing of life, which is not such as the show-piece of book-shelf as whosoever reads it may keep it there in the shelf after reading but the reader remains tempted to assimilate it as many times he reads his literature. Be pleased to read his book <span class="char-style-override-3">‘Jeevan Ke Mahakate Phul’</span> (The fragrant blossoms of life) after his books <span class="char-style-override-3">‘Swarn-Path’; ‘Anandmay Jiwan’, ‘Amrit Ke Ghunt’ ‘Akash Ki Nai Kiran’ ‘Jiwan Me Naya Prakash’</span> etc., published by ‘Gita Press’ Gorakhpur. Prof. Mahendra’s Pen, which has painted such bright paintings on the canvas of life that create the forceful thrill in the heart and uncontrolled fluttering of lips just to see it, is felicitating—‘Well done!’</p>

<p class="Page-Break">II Shri Hari II</p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Peace, prosperity and happiness by spiritual outlook</p>
<p class="Text">A saint was enjoying the beauty of nature and flowers sitting in a very cheerful posture in the royal garden of a king. The royal garden had been decorated expensively. Green creeping plants and laughing flowers of different colours, fascinating fragrance, the greenery of grass, cool breezing, and the natural beauty of the water-flow nearby were overwhelming the  saint with bliss. Being unconscious of his body and mind in the state of intoxication, he was enjoying the charming beauty of Nature. </p>
<p class="Text">This carefree state of bliss of the saint displeased the king. Why should a common man sit without any permission in his garden? He approached the saint in anger and said—‘Do you know whose garden is this?’ </p>
<p class="Text">The saint remained sitting in the same posture being carefree. The glow of the peace and delight was still glowing on his face as before. He answered—</p>
<p class="Text">‘This garden is mine and it is I who am enjoying it.’ Uttering so, expanding and making himself easier, he sat down and went on gazing the pleasant and soothing Nature. The king—‘Don’t you know that this is the royal garden? I am the king, the lord of this state. This is my garden. I have the right over this. Its flowers, creepers, plants, trees and all the other beautiful objects of nature here are mine. Special investment has been made from the royal treasury to enhance my delight. Each and every tree of this garden is invaluable. They have been caused to bring from far and wide. Unlimited royal expenditure has been made to plant and flourish them. Even then, the half naked in ochre coloured clothes and skeleton bodied destitute orphan like you claim of your right on it. The man who is unable to fulfil the common needs of his body and stomach, can ever be the master of this garden?’</p>
<p class="Text">The saint remained listening to the arrogant intoxicative speech of the king. Then, defusing his sweet smile he said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘O the king! You are failing to enjoy the charming beauty of the green creepers, flowers, plants trees and other objects of this garden so much as much I am enjoying in spite of your abundance of royal means and sources. Even after so much expenditure and lookafter and protection by a number of servants your honour being, unable to equal me in the enjoyment, is the open evidence of the fact that this garden does not belong to you. Here, the beautiful form of Nature is lying open. He, whose sense organs are capable to enjoy its pleasure, whose sensitivity is minute to assimilate the Nature, who can establish identity with Nature with rapt attention, is the lord of this garden. Beauty and delight are the matter of heart. Only the tender-hearted man can enjoy its taste, otherones, who may spend huge money on it, can never be its lord. Beautiful and pleasant objects are really the property of those compassionate persons who get pleasure and delight from them. I am enjoying the charms of this beautiful garden. So, it is mine.</p>
<p class="Text">Hearing this the king became thoughtful. The profound truth was hidden in the words of the saint. It was true that he had spent uncountable money in the decoration and nurturing of the garden, In the nursing and collection of the plants he spent lavishly. But he had no immune heart to enjoy the art of the Nature. He used to remain entangled with the numberless worries of the royal affairs even while walking in the garden. In such a beautiful atmosphere of the Nature, the political and diplomatic complications always kept him restless. To walk in the garden was for him just like to settle the problems of royal affairs sitting in the royal assembly. A number of persons presented before him in the royal assembly, and in the garden, all of them used to be seen before his mind. It was equal for him whether the garden was there or not.</p>
<p class="Text">Actually, there is hidden a great secret of delight and pleasure in the above mentioned instance. The sentimental feelings of pleasure and beauty are related to our heart. A flower of rose or coloured clouds, rising sun or melodious music, a pleasant painting, which we consider charming, it may be possible that the otherone’s sight may get no charm there and he may not feel pleasant to see it. But if eyes of beauty, the ears worthy of the taste of melodious music and flooded heart with love and compassion belong to you, then, take it granted that you will feel more pleasure in the objects belonging to others than they.</p>
<p class="Text">Pleasure and beauty are personal emotions. The subtleness of the feeling of sympathy and enjoying the bliss are individually different. To remain close to any beautiful object does not mean that he is getting pleasure and inspiration from the object in the same proportion as a compassionate man can get. </p>
<p class="Text">Contrary to it, a sensitive person can enjoy many objects of others only by the minute observation of his philosophy, the depth of feelings and liberal out look. You may go and enjoy the objects of Nature in the garden of those who plant it. You can enter the splendid state of art and painting by testing the art of paintings, painted in the houses of the men of riches. You can enjoy the melodious music being played on in their houses. You can broaden the scope of your spirit by sharing the joys and sorrows of others. The others children are your own children. Everyone who is related to you is your friend and well-wisher.</p>
<p class="Text">In reality the beauty and pleasure are not in the  objects. It is in the mind of the person who scans it. The measurement of our pleasure and beauty depends on the height and broadness of our mind. The more refined the taste is, the more compassionate and open the heart is, the more pleasure and beauty he enjoys. It is the outlook of man that gives him pleasure. The worldly and materialistic enjoyments for which, the world beings are restless, have not the least reality of pleasure at all. The real pleasure is in our own inner spirit.</p>
<p class="Text">Don’t be distressed to think that you are not owner of big gardens, grand palaces or huge buildings. Just imagine that if these things belonged to you, certainly, you could not shift them anywhere else. Even if you were its master, these things would have been far from you. Only in your mind a self possessive sense would have prevailed that you are the master of these materials and others have no right on them. Considering them as your own only in your imagination, you can be free of the sense of mineness which makes the heart of the owners of these objects narrow.</p>
<p class="Text">Considering all the worldly objects as if your own, enjoy them. The Supreme Lord has created each and every object for you only, to absorb your spirit in the pleasure and peace and for your help. The gardens full of greenery, the banks of the rivers flowing with sweet and gentle sound with unlimited exhilaration, the soothing shadow of the trees, flowers, pleasant and cool breezing, public places, temples, Monastery—all belong to you. Consider your own temple where you enter for worship, meditation, devotional songs etc. Suppose you were its lord, how would you maintain its cleanness and beauty, how seriously would you have looked after it and remained careful, you can do so even now. You go to any public inn or any library. Maintain the cleanness of the room of every public inn in which you stay, considering it your own. Read the book or newspaper in a public library so carefully as if your own. Just as you use your own objects very carefully, adopt the same attitude while using them also. </p>
<p class="Text">As much identification you have with the public objects, so much pleasure you will feel. By extending the sense of oneness, you will feel the juice of oneness in most of the lifeless objects, animals-birds, flowers-plants, gardens and at public places. Everything is meant for you only. The God has created each and every object only for your sake, you can feel jocund with them—keep this attitude in your mind. Move one step ahead and think that unreal even higher than these enjoyments of unreal world more refined and superior there is an other source of bliss also. That infinite eternal ocean of happiness and pleasure is the bliss of your self-spirit. After entering that universe of soul, one feels the eternal joy and supreme peace. That is such a divine bliss where the death has got no approach. By the dalliance of this supreme enjoyment, we become free from the fear of death and we become immersed in the eternal supreme powerful divinity. On attaining this immutable state, the adverse occurences and circumstances cannot make us ruffled. </p>
<p class="Text">Never think that you are destitute, poor and helpless or you are not the owner of so many objects. The want of any object should not be the cause of your worry. There is no question of scarcity in this well-affluent extensive creation of the God. Everywhere there is the abundance of prosperity for you. It may not be today but tomorrow these objects of riches are available to you, it is certain. The victory of abundance over scarcity, nobility over evil the truth over untruth is inevitable. There is no room for narrowness in the creation, it is in your mental outlook itself. In its place, we should contemplate about one’s own colossal expansive soul. </p>
<p class="Text">In your soul there is no lack. Expanse is everywhere there. The soul which God has blessed you, whose illumination is observed in the entire creation, that is your soul itself residing within you until a man is conscious of his own soul or has got self-realization, he remains ignorant of his spiritual lustre and his potency. After adopting the spiritual outlook in life there comes a great change in man’s life. He starts realizing the presence of an aspect of his divine soul everywhere. He sees the glimpse of affinity in every man, animal, bird, insect, lifeless objects. He becomes free from narrowness and nobility enters his mind. By adopting the spiritual outlook, it seems to him as if he has come in the celestial light from the darkness or he has awaken from the dream and come in the state of reality. The scarcity of petty objects due to which the worldly men suffer sorrow and pain to the realized soul these very objects appear quite mean, trivial and unsubstantial. The reason is that because of the evolution of his eternal conscious blissful, he remains calm and free from passion, distraction and he abides in the environment of divinity. </p>
<p class="Text">There is a very common and short way to attain the spiritual outlook and to remain endowed with the constant happiness to recognise and realize one’s soul and see its shadow in the entire world. We all are in the possession of these divine accomplishments, which are in the Supreme God. Everyone is fully competent to develop his divine spiritual powers having given up the worldliness, sensuousness, jealousy, greed and petty selfishness. I am in reality, the eternal soul, and immortal one. My sense organs are restrained by my mind. I move in the world freely and fearlessly. My soul remains unaffected at all by any external struggle, miseries and oppositions or against references, my soul is not going to be hurt the least. I have surrendered the reign of my mind to the hands of my mind. Selfishness, narrowness, poverty, scarcity—cannot revolt in the state of my spirit. My mind has realized the greatness of the soul. If such thoughts prevail in our mind, we start realizing that the Lord has not kept His sons deprived of any object, which are actually useful for them.</p>
<p class="Text">You have endless capabilites. As to the proportion you reveal your capability, abiding in the innersense and you practise the identification of the self with the self of others, you start getting rid of self-created narrowness, to the same proportion your defiled life will be far away from you and your sense organs will start enjoying the happiness of higher rank. Believe in that all the scarcities, all the sins, sorrows, miseries, fear and worldly worries are created by you yourself. Your soul is not in bondage of these. Keep yourself aloof from these, being released from them. Be one with the soul which blesses you with full happiness, supreme bliss and supreme peace. </p>
<p class="Text">Your power of love, powers of benevolence, sympathy and pity, kindness and pathos, divine powers of God-devotion in numbers are lying hidden inactive in your innerself. Due to your ignorance you have not developed them. It is only needed to make them active by constant practice and unshakable faith. By virtue of meditation and reflection, there can be reinforced. The meditation of the supreme Lord, the full concentration in Him and remembering Him again and again by muttering, we can increase the powers of our spirit.</p>
<p class="Text">Due to their ignorance many people have come to the conclusion that they can never attain, happiness, peace and divinity. Talent, accomplishments and powers are God-gifted oblations. Are you also of the same opinion? If it is so, remove this delusion of your mind at once today itself. The Nature has provided you enough means and capacity. As your spiritual realization and your spiritual attitude develops, so will expand the light of the lamp of knowledge, divine capacity and moral strength also. The momentary worldly pleasures and the darkness of deformatory attachments are destroyed. The fierce disturbance of mind, its constant unstability and dreadful blow of mental tendencies are cooled down. Having got rid of the false worldly creations, false attachments the man attains unobtainable divine capacity.</p>
<p class="Text">Realize your self-consciousness. That is your true form of Bliss and Consciousness. That is such a state where there is Supreme Bliss, perfect happiness and Supreme Peace. The spiritual truth is the only means to make you get rid of delusions, ignorance and decisions taken in ignorance. Peace is attained by introverting the traits of mind into it.</p>
<p class="Text">On attaining the spiritual sight the diseases, distress, sorrows, scarcity, victory, defeat, repute, humiliation, greed, hunger, joy, sorrow cannot disturb us. They cannot bind the soul in bondage. After realizing Atma nothing else remains to be known.</p>
<p class="Text">That what is eternal pleasure, which is present in the entire world in the manifisted form, which spreads the illumination everywhere without any restrain, which blesses us with the sight of foremost supreme sprirt by pulling us from the deep well of darkness, to attain that mental condition is the only spiritual outlook. This is only the supreme stable eternal truth. Merging in the soul the eyes of wisdom get opened and all bondages and lacks get extinct.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Modern life of tension and mental sickness</p>
<p class="Text">A clerk gentleman of a very common status somewhat perturbed, came upright to me and begged for Rupees five hundred to borrow. I asked him in amazement—‘Have you settled the marriage of your daughter and managing for it or are you sending your son somewhere else outside in connection with his higher education? What will you do with the money? </p>
<p class="Text">Browing beat he said in a loud pitch of voice—‘Oh! What to tell! I have been passing a very perturbed life for three months. My mind is restless and burdensome. My mind remains always heavy with tension?</p>
<p class="Text">‘Why? what is the matter?’ I asked him in a soothing voice.</p>
<p class="Text">‘The matter is nothing but a triffling and it has become a mountain of mole hill. My neighbouring drunkard dwelling in front of my house clashed with me on a triffling matter. First, he used hot words in passion and then came to blows. It turned to fighting. He has filed a criminal suit against me; but his case is weak. I have engaged a famous lawyer and have been winning the case till now. Enough! How can I eat humble pie before such a below standard man? My prestige is at stake. Now, a little sum of amount will be spent undoubtedly but I will teach him a lesson of humiliation. Well! Please, manage for me by anyway for Rupees five hundred only. Money can be earned, it is earned and spent but it is necessary to teach that wicked a lesson by giving him a blow of defeat.’ While conversing he got excited. His brows got curved and eyes became red. </p>
<p class="Text">It was clear that he was bent upon taking the revenge. Even after three months of the event, his agitated and fiery mind had not been cooled down.  His mind was full of tension. His mind seemed to be tired and burdened. This tensionised mind is the root of mental ill.</p>
<p class="Text">This incidence is of recent past when a man became so mad in wrath that he cut down the nose of his wife, though the cause of his wrath was very simple. His wife used to insist on going to her maternal house off and on. The husband used to remain overpowered with anger. This tension went on increasing and taking root in his mind. UItimately it ended in a terrible result. The husband would have suffered the punishment and the wife became disfigured forever.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Ò Ò Ò Ò</p>
<p class="Text">I have a friend. He is a Hindi poet of high rank. He is a professor. There is magic in his pen. He suffers from the problem of sound sleeplessness in the night. He remains changing the sides on the bed. Several times he takes the sleeping drug while going to retire on bed; but the doctor always alerts him of the danger of the intoxicating medicines. The regular dose of the intoxicating medicines should be avoided. Now, without that medicine he does not get sleep for continuously even two nights. He is now disturbed with the disease of sleeplessness. Once, he had written to me informing me about his mental disease—‘My teacher Prof. Broganwakar had been suffering from this very disease for thirty years and at last, he died of the internal mental tension.’ I have observed many patients, suffering from the disease of sleeplessness who remain ready to sacrifice a lot for a little sleep. In Delhi, a young girl of eighteen years could not sleep for the whole year. A sixty years old woman being afflicted with her son’s death didn’t sleep completely for twelve years. This insomnia is the result of the long tensionised life and useless worry and hidden fear permanently abiding in our mind.</p>
<p class="Text">This is a news from Ranchi—</p>
<p class="Text">‘It has come to the notice that a Uranva youth, belonging to the village Duraganva under Police station, Lohardaga district Ranchi murdered his father by beating with bamboo-stick. The father had scolded his young son with abusive words only. He took it ill and agitated so extremely that he murdered his father.’</p>
<p class="Text">Due to such a small reason, such a great sinful deed occured. It was the result only of the hidden tension secretly settled in his mind.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Ò Ò Ò Ò</p>
<p class="Text">A young student fled away to Bombay in the attraction of the cinema world. He remained wandering there as a half mad. He remained knocking about from door to door of movies producing companies, He had intense desire in his mind to become a filmy star. Unfortunately nowadays, the cheap films, which are being made are full of sexuality, wantonness and immoral deeds. To see them the youths become addicted of moving in the dreamland. They remain overpowered with the tension created by passion and sexuality. When this student found nothing, he committed suicide. It was written in his suicide note found in his pocket—‘I wanted to become the hero of the cinema. I don’t want to remain alive in such a world of deformation; where there is none to value my art-skill. Thus the mental tension became the cause of his death. </p>
<p class="Text-Black">Ò Ò Ò Ò</p>
<p class="Text">A young bride committed suicide being fed up with the piercing satirical remarks of her mother-in-law. The last letter she wrote, it had been made clear there that she was fed up with the discard and suffocation and thus, she was ending her life. The women mostly suffer from excess of tension which compels them to live in the hell of mind.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Ò Ò Ò Ò</p>
<p class="Text">It is just recently an old pensioner fell down and died in the bank while withdrawing his pension. A teacher died sitting in the chair while teaching in the class. The teachers and students had to perform his funeral rites.</p>
<p class="Text">Such men always remain in the condition of worry and tension. They remain always disturbed with imaginary fear and mental diseases. The family—worries either small or big, run after them in their mind every moment. These long lived worries become mental diseases increasing day by day and at last they become the cause of death. </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">What are the causes of tension?</p>
<p class="Text">The question arises, why is mental tension created?</p>
<p class="Text">The people in general today lose their temper on worthless matters. The bad tendency to take it ill and the feeling of jealousy and hostility has become so common and so sharp and violent that they become agitated by the mild hurt of their egotism. Their heartily instincts become uncontrolled. When the hostility is created with otherone, the worry and anxiety is natural and then it creates mental tension. Their condition becomes like a monster of human body.</p>
<p class="Text">It is the nature of animals to become furiated or dissatisfied without any reason, to hurt with horn or legs and bite with teeth. </p>
<p class="Text">If anyone just touches the snake even by mistake or unknowingly, it will become so fierce in anger even by a mild hurt on account of its wicked nature that it will take the life of the facing person. </p>
<p class="Text">It is said that the lions, tigers and panthers are so ill-tempered that they are annoyed merely as why he looked on face. Casting the eyes down one may pass on, it may be possible but they consider it their insult to be faced by others. This is heard through the people that the demons, devils, monsters and ghosts are also heartless in the same way. To hear a little against them, they lose their sense in passion. </p>
<p class="Text">The serpent, lion and goblin-devil are not considered to belong to the human class of birth but many of them are found in the shape of men also. Those who have not learnt to restrain their voilent instincts, their anger and agitation, insanity and passion, are voilent animals truely. </p>
<p class="Text">The modern law does not permit to take revenge at once. So the fury to others, agitation and passion remain hidden in our mind. Today the court cases are increasing very fast and the advocates are earning unfairly. Its main reason is that the people want to cool down their tension through the court cases.</p>
<p class="Text">He used abusive words against me, he damaged my prestige, he damaged my reputation, he defeated me and he usurped my wealth—when such thoughts are stored in the mind hidden, the mind is filled with tensions. Man starts plotting against them to take revenge by anyway. The hostility goes on increasing. Hatred begets hatred; it cannot subside it. Love, kindness, pity, compassion, affection, sympathy etc., are such tender instincts that can pacify the instinct of hostility and the tension is minimised—</p>
<p class="Text">It has been said also—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अक्रोशदवधीन्यां स ह्यजयदहरच्च मे।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये च तन्नोपनह्यन्ति वैरं तेषूपशाम्यति॥</p>
<p class="Text">He abused me, insulted me, beat me, defeated me and forcibly took my wealth—those who don’t provide room to such thoughts in their mind, are free from hostility and tension.</p>
<p class="Shlok">न हि वैरेण वैराणि शाम्यन्तीह कदाचन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अवैरेण हि शाम्यन्ति एष धर्मः सनातनः॥</p>
<p class="Text">So keep in mind—‘The hostility can never be subdued by hostility, it is love, forgiveness and friendship that bring peace and this is the eternal morality.’</p>
<p class="Text">Meaningless disputes and agitation are not the solution of the problem, on the other hand, they intensify the hatred and struggle. Court cases result is utter failure rather than the hostility continues longer. Even the party in opposition also claims his case justified. So, whether they win or lose the case but they leave after them repentence, remorse and a long chain of tragic helplessness.</p>
<p class="Text">The tensionised condition is dreadful. The passion and agitation should not be given place in the sub-conscious mind. Be aware of the passionate thoughts. There should be self-control, patience and peace at the time emotional agitation, perturbness, impetuosity, anger and imbalance. At such a moment the work should be done with cool mind and patience.</p>
<p class="Text">If you are able to maintain the mental balance, there can never be any adverse situation where the way is not possible to be found out. You should only maintain the balance of your mind. Find out the solution with a considerable understanding, intelligently with farsightedness. </p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Premature-death by perplexity</p>
<p class="Text">It has come to the notice through a reporter that in America, the patients of blood pressure and heart, the number of suicide commiters and the patients of insomnia have increased by leaps and bounds in comparison to the past several years. Eight lakh and eighty eight thousand people died of high blood pressure, Nine lakh of people died of insomnia and about three lakhs of people died of cancer. This number of death is just the double in comparison to the past few years. All these persons have died terribly because of the perplexity of mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Such types of uncountable deaths are common in every country every year and none is paying serious attention towards it and mostly are not even published in the news papers. Most of the cases of premature death are of such persons as have fallen ill due to the loss of the life giving energy by addiction of intoxication, sexual enjoyments, triffling worries of business, immoral love-relations, worthless disappointments and mental agitation. Their mental balance derailed so much that they could never be cured.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">What is the disturbed life?</p>
<p class="Text">If you ever felt mental agony or disturbance and felt annoyed and your desires remained unfulfilled, you become forgetting and fuming. In the situation of anger you feel tension in your mind and inwardly you remain perturbed, restless and desultory and become worried again and again and your mind is bent upon to vent one’s spleen. By these symptoms it can be marked that your mind is perturbed. This disturbance of mind may be the cause of untimely death or heart-ailment. </p>
<p class="Text">The disturbance of mind is very harmful for our health. The psychic of man’s mind going beyond limit, may create perturbation and mental disease. </p>
<p class="Text">The perturbed man does not feel sleep in the night. He passes the whole night changing the sides on his bed. The insult made by anyone always pinches his mind in the night, sometimes remains frightened by public slander, pungent criticism in the society or his opposition. He remains fearful from false reproach. He becomes turbulent just hearing a little reproach against him and he fails to tolerate it.</p>
<p class="Text">Generally, the family conflicts are the causes of the turbulence. Among the women the triffling matters become the cause of pungency wordy altercation and critical remarks. They turn the moles to mountain even the triffling problems and spoil by allowing too much indulgence including the entire family. This tumult noise on triffling matters always go on disturbing the tender-hearted men. The loafing of the children, the worry of daughter’s marriage, the difference of opinion between the husband-wife, the scarcity of money, intoxication, rising prices and humiliation caused by the officers or torture by them etc., hundreds of reasons may be responsible to cause mental perplexity. Perplexity is the fruit of suffocation and humiliation.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The strain of nervous system</p>
<p class="Text">In this connection, the opinion of the greatest psychologist, William James is valuable—</p>
<p class="Text">‘The imaginary and useless worries of the present and future, the hidden fears of the mind and needless strain of nervous system decreases our working capacity certainly and creates hindrance on his path of progress. The main cause of untimely death or heart-attack is the strain on the nervous system.’ </p>
<p class="Text">The man entangled in so many complications and entanglements, remains afflicted with tension. Constant mental tension creates deformations in the nervous system and the face becomes faded for emotional expression. This is one of the reasons of American’s emotionalessness. If you remain always worried or you are suffering from any hidden fear; if there is any restlessness regarding future, then note it that there is strain on your mind. Your nerves and muscles will always remain stretched. </p>
<p class="Text">Suppose, you are sitting in a simple chair and you are taking your breath at the rate of 18-19 per minute in place of 16 per minute and you start breathing before taking every breath out, there will be unnecessary pressure on your nervous system. You will be panting always, you will remain disturbed with the future worries.</p>
<p class="Text">On the other hand, if your forehead is shrink free lines of worries, you take your breath slowly and slowly mentaly free peacefully, your muscles remain loose, the worries can never even touch your mind.  	</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The internal turbulent condition of modern mankind</p>
<p class="Text">The so-called gentle and cultured mankind today is badly turbulent by his mind. His mental tension remains constant. He remains always sunk in the ocean of economic and social problems mentally. He remains distressed by the imaginary feelings of inferiority complex and the weakness of nervous system having been tired of the social gaps like mountain. These troubles are generally artificial and imaginary. </p>
<p class="Text">The poor health of the modern men is also one of the vital causes of the weakness of his nervous system. Nutritive edibles, ghee, milk or pure fresh items of food are not available to them. He pulls on the machine of his body depending on the aridity creating objects in the mind like wine, tea, coffee, biri (a form of crude cigarette) cigarette, intoxicating objects. On these artificial intoxicating elements the machine of the body does work for some time but ultimately it is broken to pieces and the untimely death occurs. So the physical treatment of the nervous system is a must. For a sound health, natural food and natural treatment should be practised.</p>
<p class="Text">The seed of sound health is planted in the very womb of the mother. So long as the mother and father are not fully cautious of their physical and mental health, the coming generation cannot be safe from the mental diseases.</p>
<p class="Text">Nowadays it has become very common to critcize bitterly to one another, to find out others fault, to blame  others, complains and show of jealousy. The dirty habit of finding fault at others is specially found in the politicians but it should not perturb us.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Maintain the mental balance at the time of hardships</p>
<p class="Text">In the moments of difficulties, first of all, let the mental peace be protected from the polluted impact on our minds. Keep your mind cool and pondering over by cool mind and heart, find out any means to get rid of and implement it. Be aware of mental disturbance. If your mind got influenced then think that your all weapons were snatched away and all the means to face were ended.</p>
<p class="Text">The easiest way to save the mind is neutrality. But what is meant by neutrality?</p>
<p class="Text">Any hardships be fallen on you, contemplate and study it in such a way as if you are not concerned with that calamity at all, as if no problem arose before you and if any mishappening has happened, you are mere a spectator.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Remain firm like rock before the protest and criticism</p>
<p class="Text">Treading on the path of truth, never be perturbed at all by the meaningless critical remarks of others. All the greatmen have to face opposition and they have faced it boldly and successfully with cool and peaceful mind. </p>
<p class="Text">Once, the great sage Daya Nandji Sarswati was opposed in a very dirty way knowingly by some people. This relates to Pune. By making his cut-out, which was garlanded with shoes; seated on a donkey in the form of procession it was demonstrated in the whole market. The face of the statue had been painted with black colour. When this news was conveyed to Swamiji, he uttered— </p>
<p class="Text">‘The duplicate Dayanand faces such situation. If that is the duplicate Dayanand, he deserves to be treated so miserably. I am the real Dayanand sitting before you steady in calm mood. This criticism is nothing to affect me in the least.</p>
<p class="Text">Even hearing his opposition, he remained steady and peaceful as usual. He was not perturbed the least. There was no trace of any disturbance at all on his face.</p>
<p class="Text">In the same way, an agitated Pandit of karnawas (U.P.) used to abuse Swamiji daily, but he paid no heed. By chance one day, he fell ill and did not come to abuse him. On this account, Panditji sent fruits for him. On this compassionate treatment, he was very much ashamed and his habit of abusing was given up.</p>
<p class="Text">A certain man used bitter words and abusive language for Mahatma Buddha daily and scorned him. He went on disturbing him by abusing for four days continuously; but the Mahatma always remained steady and peaceful they are never disturbed. He was very much amazed at the mental peace of Mahatma Buddha.</p>
<p class="Text">He said—‘My piercing words have no effect on you at all.’</p>
<p class="Text">Mahatma Buddha answered—‘If anyone does not accept any gift, whom does this gift belong to?’</p>
<p class="Text">He said—‘That belongs to the giver.’</p>
<p class="Text">Buddha said—‘You abused me which I did not accept. So, all your bitter words, abusive language and scorn remained with you.’</p>
<p class="Text">He had no answer. Actually this is the condition of fully steady and peaceful mind the practice of which washes away the worries and disturbance of mind.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The new method to escape from perturbation</p>
<p class="Text">A specialised doctor of mental diseases of England Dr. Hanery Rollin’s experience is that music, devotional songs, repeatedly singing of divine names loudly and the recitation of the verses of literature play a very important role in removing the perturbation of mind, tension and mental problems. Dr. Hanery Rollin has a very big hospital of mental diseases.</p>
<p class="Text">He has disclosed that about ten years back when the patients of mental problem were brought for treatment, it was not proved much beneficial. Later on, when some such patients who had interest in music were motivated and other patients who did not know music were also encouraged to join them; it proved very useful in curing them. This experiment proved successful to a great extent.</p>
<p class="Text">Dr. Hanery’s opinion is that for the treatment through music it is necessary that the patients should be kept in groups. A patient of mental problem remains always eager of the assurance that he is needed for the society. To encourage him to sing has proved to be an assurance. This experiment has proved beneficial to most of the mental patients. </p>
<p class="Text">By hearing or singing music, they become free from tension and they get a healthy flow of oblation to wash away jealousy, hostility, anger and worries.</p>
<p class="Text">All kinds of tension and disturbance are originated in mind. In your life mind plays the principal role. </p>
<p class="Text">Your all instincts are connected with mind. If a man behaves with contented and balanced mind, pleasure and success follow him in such a way as shadow follows the man.</p>
<p class="Shlok">अक्रोशदवधीन्मां स हजयदहरच्च मे।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये च तन्नोपनह्यन्ति वैरं तेषूपशाम्यति॥</p>
<p class="Text">It means ‘He used ill words for me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed my wealth—Men who don’t mind such thoughts, get rid of hostility. They become free from tension.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">न हि वैरेण वैराणि शाम्यन्तीह कदाचन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अवैरेण हि शाम्यन्ति एष धर्म: सनातन:॥</p>
<p class="Text">Mind it—‘Enmity cannot be rooted out by enmity. Fraternity (Love, affection, kindness, compassion) cools the mind, this is the eternal Dharma. </p>
<p class="Text">Spirituality gives peace to the mind and balance of mind prevails. When the medical treatment fails, the spiritual medicine cures the mind. By the spiritual means the mental diseases of man are cured. Riddance from sorrow, disease, anguish and disappointment can be possible.</p>
<p class="Text">Where the medical treatment of knowledge and science fails, wonderful benefits can be taken on the strength of divine power. You may be suffering from the miseries of any degree, your mind may be tensionised, you might be feeling depression, please watch and test the effect of spiritual treatment also. You can be benefitted in all respects.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">A spiritual method</p>
<p class="Text">Prayer is such a spiritual method which unites the man to God directly and provides the direct divine aid. Those who call the Lord piteously, get the help certainly. The faith in God is encouraging to mankind.</p>
<p class="Text">Internal agitation and external problems are created only when a man is turned away from the Supreme Lord. The Lord is the source of immense joy. Why will anyone staying just near soft and cool water of fountain remain thirsty? The more distance from God means the more internal disturbances of mind and the more affliction of sorrow, poverty, suffering, strife and dissatisfaction. By the true devotional prayer and connecting himself to the presence of the Supreme Lord directly, a man can attain the spiritual power.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">An occurence of war period</p>
<p class="Text">It was a bullet-shot on the face of a soldier and he began to writhe in pain. The doctor advised to take the bullet out with operation. People assumed that he would die during the operation. </p>
<p class="Text">But the soldier had full faith in the dispensation of God. He began to draw the power from the source of that immensely powerful Supreme Lord by prayer. He made the prayer of God with full devotion—</p>
<p class="Text">‘O the source of energy! Make me capable to bear the pain of this critical operation successfully. Bless me with full self-confidence to ignore the pain! I am surrendering myself to your hands.’ </p>
<p class="Text">He felt that any secret spiritual power was strengthening him with supernatural energy for the pain and suffering. The energy was being transmitted in his body. The power of Almighty has been supporting him. Having faith in the divine power he slept by and by. </p>
<p class="Text">When in the next morning he got up, he was feeling fresh energy. People thought that he was dead, but he told happily, ‘Doctor! I am ready for operation.’</p>
<p class="Text">All were amazed at his bravery. Only because of his self-confidence, the operation was successful and that soldier survived. He narrated that it is the fruit of secret godly help. He had prayed with true devotion that is why his body affliction were removed and came out safely from the jaws of the death.</p>
<p class="Text">Believe in God, the theism means to think that I am permeated by a single Supreme element. That eternal supreme element is present in every object.</p>
<p class="Text">By the true prayer of the Lord, singing hymn in His praise, worship and congregational singing (hymn) and true devotion, our anguish and grief, scarcity and suffering are washed away. A man having faith in God suffers neither from any internal woe nor has he to suffer in his active external life. In all the circumstances considering it a frolic, he maintain his life blissful by virtue of his divine virtues and divine traits.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Practice to remain free from mental tension</p>
<p class="Text">Make such effort that tension and perturbation may  not get room in your mind. By the mercy of God, all the worldly affairs are accomplished without any effort. Without any reason you remain restless about them and become unhealthy because of keeping your mind filled with agitation. Your all the problems are being solved one by one themselves. It is better you do your duty only and have faith in God for fruit. </p>
<p class="Text">The man disturbed by mental tension, goes on proceeding towards untimely death. Form such habits  as your needs may be minimum possible. The unfulfilled needs create mental tension. The man having the minimum needs, can enjoy the state of peaceful life easily. Those who have formed the dirty habits of sensuous enjoyments, comfortable life, the palate-taste or longing for the sense objects, intoxication, remain always perturbed with mental tension due to their unfulfilled artificial and false needs; better you don’t do so. It is mentioned in our Shastras—</p>
<p class="Shlok">वियात विश्वमत्रिणम्!</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Rigved. 1/86/10)</p>
<p class="Text">The gluttons face untimely death. Have control over your tongue. Eat to live healthy and not to enjoy taste.</p>
<p class="Text">By eating of unwholesome edibles, there is stimulation of passion and then mental tension upsets us.</p>
<p class="Text">If you want to live happily cool minded, peaceful and stable, give up the thoughts that cause pain to the spirit.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Immorality, doing unrighteous deeds, the evil thoughts of worry deserve to be entirely abandoned.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">Protect yourself from this green-eyed monster</p>
<p class="Text">Seeing a hunch-backed old woman the sage Narad became graceful. He said—‘O the old woman! Come to me I will cure your hunch-backness by the power of my Yoga.</p>
<p class="Text">The old woman said with folded hands—‘Naradbaba! If you are graceful to me, let me remain hunch-backed.’ Kindly make my neighbour also hunch-backed.</p>
<p class="Text">Being amazed Naradmuni asked—‘O the old woman! What will be your gain by the other being hunch-backed?’</p>
<p class="Text">The old woman said—‘I will feel pleasure to see other walking in the hunch-backed posture.’</p>
<p class="Text">This is the case of an old hunch-backed woman overpowered by the feelings of jealousy, who is interested in the grief of others, forgetting her own pleasure. It means that if the feeling of jealousy prevails dominantly in the world, it is not the heaven of pleasure but it may turn to the dark pit of ‘Raurav Hell’.</p>
<p class="Text">What is jealousy?</p>
<p class="Text">Jealousy is a wicked feeling that creates pain and jealousy in the mind to see others virtues, pleasure, progress and prosperity. It is an inner feeling that burns us internally to see others prosperity and progress.</p>
<p class="Text">Why is it so wicked? It is so because it does not inspire us for our own progress and prosperty, but contrary to it, it stimulates for the downfall of others to see them grieved. </p>
<p class="Text">Jealousy is a blended mental disorder which is generated and grows up with the association of laziness, arrogance and disappointment. This is the sentiment of superiorty complex. In other words it strengthens the egotism of man.</p>
<p class="Text">The jealousy is connected to the inferiority complex. Due to the inferiority complex we are unable to use our full competence in making the effort to reach our goal, we only have the burning desire. First, we think—Would that I had the particular object! Then, again we think—‘Oh! he has the object but I don’t. Then, we think—If it does not belong to me, it should not belong to him as well.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Envy is the healthy state of jealousy. In envy, to see anyone endowed with comforts, prosperity, attributes or to see anyone well off, we feel sorrow for our own shortcomings and then an ardent longing is created in our mind to achieve it. The envy is that forceful intense desire or excitement, which inspires us to compete others. Envy is not a bad sentiment of mind. Here, we feel sorry for our weaknesses. Here, we want to correct our mistakes moving forward.</p>
<p class="Text">In the envy, we feel sorrow as why we did not make progress and in jealousy the matter of sorrow is—‘How and why did he progress?’ The motive behind the envy is to increase the number of virtuous, qualitative, reputed and happy persons and on the other hand the motive behind jealousy to make downfalll.</p>
<p class="Text">Envy is concerned with a particular person while jealousy is created against all those who are distinguished among the people or who are deserving of others attention. In jealousy the feeling of anger lies blended in anyway. About a jealous person it is said also that the man is burning in jealousy. In the literature jealousy is expressed in the form of auxiliary sentiment from time to time, but the anger is completely inanimate sentiment. The man against whom we react anger, we never care for the goal of his mind. A poor jealous man remains always excited and restless only to escape himself from being considered inferior. The rich man wants to see the other as down fallen. The jealousy is born as a result of unfulfilled desire to see others inferior and poor. It creates arrogance, it strenghthen egotism and it remains weaving the warp and woof of malice. Being afflicted by igotism we cannot bear to see the welfare of others and being entangled with arrogance we fail to notice our own weaknesses. The cause of arrogance is superiority complex. Jealousy is its associate—whatever is available should come to me. </p>
<p class="Text">We become used of feeling sorrow in mind because of seeing others progress as the man of my neighbour is growing higher. I am continuing in the same condition without any progress.  Then, why should he prosper in this way? There must be something bad to him also? He must also suffer from some kind of agony, disease, grief, difficulties. I must cause some trouble to him. It will hurt him any way by doing so. By such thoughts our mind is hurt. All thoughts cause our noble and virtuous instincts and vital breath to deteriorate by and by. </p>
<p class="Text">Being mad in jealousy, man abandons the path of righteousness, morality and reason. His common condition even becomes the condition of intoxicated mind and others general condition seems to him exception. The disorder caused by jealousy in mind creates different types of deformations in the mental condition. Fear, nervousness, delusion, all these are originated by the depreciation of reasoning due to jealousy.</p>
<p class="Text">Every action has its reaction. The exposed reaction of the jealous actions in the outer sphere of mind is poisonous. The impure feelings of man pollute the surrounding atmosphere. The poisonous atmosphere becomes the cause of everyone’s harm. The feelings of jealousy that we have for others, probably its reaction among them also may be similar against us. </p>
<p class="Text">Those who consider that they can hide their jealous sentiments in their mind, commit a blunder. It is certain that it will be exposed by any means. From the  psychological point of view, other misconduct and the thinking to hide it, is the mother of several mental diseases. In so many persons, the behaviour like senselessness and madness is the outcome of mental complex born of jealousy. The jealousy remains active inside the mind and continues doing undesirable acts. The human life is not the result of only those sentiments, thoughts, emotional feelings, resolves, which exists on the surface of memory rather than the hidden characters and feeligs of our mind which are not in our memory even openly  also influence our personality. The secret jealousy lying in our secret mind is always active in our life. Jealousy, anger, sexual feeling, hostility, worry, fear and every experience of misbehaviour done, leaves a print on our inner mind certainly to some extent. These traits and experience are the constant growing germs. The formation of new life or the creation of new life continues going on the basis of these germs. </p>
<p class="Text">The defilements of jealousy after making their roots in our mind, don’t go away easily. When the feeling of selfishness and egotism become formidable, there are conflicts and struggle between the dead and living sentiments loss of sleep, nervousness, revengeful attitude wait for opportunity to assail harm, indifference etc., mental worries are the indication of jealous mental condition. If this disorder becomes violent an unexpressed worry and anxiety always continues to be present in our mind. Mind forgets the care of water, food, exercise and rest. While retiring on the bed the mental conflicts and unexpressed inner passionate feeling, don’t allow us to take rest. So, all the five organs of knowledge of man are disordered; the blood circulation is interrupted. The physical diseases also become dominant. Due to the disorder in the whole body, the mind is not nourished properly.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4"> To give place to jealousy and anger in the mind is to invite the number of mental agonies and diseases. So, always remain cautious and escape yourself from jealousy. This feeling has been named as ‘Greeneyed monster’ exactly right.<span></span></p>

<p class="Text-Black">Laughed so much to death</p>
<p class="Text">A news of Jodhpur, 23 October 65,—According to the news, a worker of Jansangh was so much overjoyed by the victory in an election that he had to be relieved of  life.</p>
<p class="Text">It is reported that on the victory of his party in the election he cheered so much that he happened to dance. From all the roots of his hair joy was bursting out, From molecule to molecule elation was reflecting; his all the parts of the body were dancing. His gladness crossed the limit. By and by increasing, it reached the climax. Just as a driver fails to stop the motor car, running with very fast speed by using the sudden brake, similarily he could not check the speed of his profound joy. Enough, he went on laughing. He remained laughing and cheering. His laughter slowly and slowly reached such a stage that he came to feel heart attack. In twinkling of eye he fell down there and died. </p>
<p class="Text">There was no deformation in his body at all, he was looking healthy and strong as usual, but his laughter had disbalanced his mind and by its assault he had lost his life.</p>
<p class="Text">Like the similar case, it was a report in the Newspapers—</p>
<p class="Text">Manila, 22nd November 1965. Forty-two years old Bentura Karwelis, on winning a bet in the phlipines elections similarily due to laughter beyond the limit died. As the matter was reported, he was narrating before his family members laughing cheerfully in the loud voice how he had won a bet of ten bags of rice. He felt pain is the chest. He felt some strain and tightness in his body and at once, he died of brain stroke.</p>
<p class="Text">Hear the third news—</p>
<p class="Text">It is concerning to Shivhar, Muzaffarpur, on 2nd July 1965. In the assemblage of a marriage party of this village, the music and dance was at climax. In the whole assembly the stream of enjoyment and pleasure was flowing all around. It was the world of wantonness there. All were in the jocund mood of joking and jesting. He began to laugh at any matter and while laughing excessively, he died.</p>
<p class="Text">It is said that this man was watching the dance in the mood of intoxication standing on the support of the bamboo of the tent. He was so much engrossed that he had forgotten everything. Abruptly, by a joke of the dance he burst into such a laughter, which he could not check. That laughter went on increasing slowly and slowly and later on it transgressed the limit of endurance. He laughed so much that he fell down there and died the very moment. This mournful event interrupted the whole pleasant atmosphere. The people were so much surprised that they were unable to imagine that anybody might die of laughter.</p>
<p class="Text">Any instinct of mind if goes beyond limit and our mind becomes uncontrolled, that becomes the cause of death.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">What will be now?</p>
<p class="Text">A news of Bulandshahar 3rd July 1965—</p>
<p class="Text">What will be now? What will be now? It was the voice of a weak farmer; which stopped his heart-beating and led him to death.</p>
<p class="Text">The whole occurence is as such six miles away from there a farmer of the village—Sikhaura, Malkhan Sing’s entire crop got damaged on account of heavy rain and flood and the weak-hearted farmer’s mind was hurt as—‘Oh what will be now? How will be sustenance? Who will help? how will the food and clothes be available? His mind was distressed with such a hidden fear that his inner instincts could not bear this percussion. This dreadful worry as if, had made his future perfectly dark. It resulted so that he could not have his inner conflict under control. He lost his courage and patience. The disappointment surrounded him. Thus, being unable to control his inner mental conflict and by sudden heart-attack, he passed away.</p>
<p class="Text">Having such men in view in the Vedas it has been said here—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अपवक्ता हृदयाविधश्चित्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Rigved. 1/24/8)</p>
<p class="Text">It means—‘A wise and reasonable man should give up those thoughts that cause pain to the heart. A man should bear the pain of calamity, danger, loss, death with strong heart. They should have the complete patience and maintain balance of mind.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">The fatal result of the excessive of wrath</p>
<p class="Text">This news is related to—</p>
<p class="Text">Modi Nagar—1 June 1965. Four miles away from here, near the village, Bhojpur on a brick furnace a dispute ensued between contractor and brick-making labourer for wages. On one side, the summer season and on the other side demonical frenzy of wrath led to a brick-maker fainting and instant spot death. Having The police noted the case and sent the dead body for post-mortem. This dreadful result had come out because of the excess of wrath and lack of tolerance.</p>
<p class="Text">The second news report is as such— </p>
<p class="Text">Kanpur, 5th July 1965. A resident of the village—Nigoh under the Shivali Police Station, was arrested on the charge of committing murder of his six months old daughter. It is reported that due to the constant weeping of the infant, being wrathful, that angry man threw down the child forcibly on the ground, as a result she died.</p>
<p class="Text">Being perturbed by this, the man himself also ran to jump into a well to commit suicide but acosting him the people handed him over to the police.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Death in dispute</p>
<p class="Text">A news report of Kanpur. ‘Whether the ‘Kumbh-bath’ is beneficent or not?’ On this a fierce dispute broke out in Bighapur station, in the district, Unnao. Both the groups became furious in anger. In the frenzy of wrath the provocation started and became violent. One of them died and another was injured.</p>
<p class="Text">Such a news reveals the fact that when the emotions of man goes out of control and then, they become the cause of great violence and crisis.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">A Calamity</p>
<p class="Text">Lisban! 31st July 1965. The Portugal news Society, Lucy Tania has reported that two men of Portutgali populated area, Goa, India jumped down from Lorry being frightened and one of them died.</p>
<p class="Text">The story is such—Two men were provided seat in a Lorry on their request. When they saw the covering of the coffin, lying near them rising up slowly, they were frightened and remained gazing it, but when from the coffin the drowsy voice was heard, ‘Has the rain stopped?; they were extremely frightened and out of fear they jumped down from the Lorry. One of them died and the another one was badly injured. Later on, it came to the notice that their fear was baseless. The sound that frightened them was of the man who was going to the city Ponda with the empty coffin. That man had entered the coffin to protect himself from the rain and had slept insidce the coffin.</p>
<p class="Text">There is a news of Barmer—</p>
<p class="Text">A man went for the first time to the funeral ground with the dead body for funeral rites. To see the dead man’s body for the first time, he was frightened so much that he passed many sleepless nights continued dreaming dreadful dreams. He got suspicious of fear. At last, that fear proved to be the cause of his suicide.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Only due to fear</p>
<p class="Text">A man named Jaun became disappointed from his life due to several failures. He had suffered many big mental shocks one after another in his life. He created several doubts in his mind being disturbed with the worry and perturbation. His mind was in a fix. He  himself thought— </p>
<p class="Text">‘Now, what is left in this life? The whole day passed in disappointment. What will I do to live the life of helplessness? I have no longing to live this life. It hardly matters whether God calls me from this world, I will bring the poison from the chemist just today to end this pinching pain of worry. I find only suicide the sole way to get rid over the worldly miseries.’ </p>
<p class="Text">In such a contemplation of mind being monotonous looking in a mourning apperance he went to a chemist to purchase poison.</p>
<p class="Text">Man’s face is the index of his mind. The inner feelings cannot be hidden, they come to appear on the face. The intelligent persons read the mind of the man by his facial appearance. As regards, the shop-keeper he reads the faces of the consumers throughout the day. The doubt was created in the chemist’s mind that—‘There is something black in the bottom. This man wants to end his life by taking poison.’ </p>
<p class="Text">I have to purchase the poison phial to kill the bed-bug’,—he said to the chemist.</p>
<p class="Text">‘What will you do? You never purchase any poisonous medicine; said the chemist.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Hello What to tell? The bed bugs disturb me the whole night. I am tired of them. I will get rid of them by this poison. I will take a peaceful sleep.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Mind, brother! This phial is full of poison, use it very cautiously. Be careful that it may not go to the hands of any child, otherwise he may die.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having uttered so the chemist went inside the shop and in the phial of poison he filled the harmless medicine and gave it to Jaun. </p>
<p class="Text">The chemist’s assumption proved quite true. Jaun was coward. His plan of suicide was fully planned. He was flying away from life.</p>
<p class="Text">He wrote the last letter to his wife and drank the poisonous medicine. He began to conceive death—Just to die,......Just to die. </p>
<p class="Text">Then he disclosed it also that he had taken the poison, and after a while he will be dying. </p>
<p class="Text">Then, not to wait, it created hue and cry all around.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Jaun has taken poison. Jaun is committing suicide. Make haste, save him anyhow. Call the doctor. Cause him vomiting any how, save Jaun.’ The patient’s condition was going on deteriorating.’</p>
<p class="Text">Due to unbalanced and perturbed mind his hands and feet were growing weak. His heart was throbbing badly. Just to die—just to die.’’</p>
<p class="Text">All were watching his exhausting and deterioriating condition every moment and expressing their feelings of grief. </p>
<p class="Text">At once, Jaun was taken away to the hospital to an expert doctor for the treatment and his treatment was started. </p>
<p class="Text">The doctor tested his pulse and heart very carefully, he made the urine, stool and vomiting etc., chemical test, All were expectant for his death news.</p>
<p class="Text">But astonishing! He did not die. He was waiting for the last breath lying on the bed. He was not losing his life.</p>
<p class="Text">The doctor tested the red liquid of the phial and at last said disclosing the secret—</p>
<p class="Text">‘The medicine, Jaun had taken, was not any poison. That was any harmless medicine. There was no deformation in his body.’</p>
<p class="Text">The chemist was called in. He also supported this fact. Making his view clear he said—‘I had given the harmless medicine to save Jaun’s life, that was not poison.’</p>
<p class="Text">Later on a great effort was made to convince Jaun but he was not ready to agree. Still he was the victim of mental disbalance. The fear of death had made him worried.’</p>
<p class="Text">He repeated the same again and again, ‘I have taken poison. I will not be saved to remain alive.’</p>
<p class="Text">The worry of fear and death had rooted in his mind. impatiently, It was perturbing him. This poisonous feeling had made his mind exhausted. This fear had polluted his all the nerves. The fear of death was not being washed away from the core of his mind. Due to wrong imagination and mental perturbation he was waiting for the death.</p>
<p class="Text">It resulted so that he remained in the hospital for many months in the suspicion and confusion. It took long for the patient to recover.</p>
<p class="Text">Without taking the poison only the false dread of death and mental disbalance had created these disturbances.</p>
<p class="Text">This was the opinion of the doctors that only the fear of taking poison had made him reach near death. It is not known how many persons are mentaly sick in the confusion and suspicion of such type of worries.</p>
<p class="Text">This example clears that the fear, worry, perturbation,  blind faith, mental pressure, all these have a great effect in our mind.</p>
<p class="Text">The same idea has been expressed by Dr. William Edler in these words—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Mental feelings react verily our physical actions. If our mind is sick, it is certain that body will also suffer from sickness. If the patient is mentaly worried, fearful, doubtful about death, then the doctor has to face great difficulty in his treatment.</p>
<p class="Text"> Take it granted that not only one but a number of persons looking physically healthy outwardly, are suffering from mental disease bearing in their mind hidden suspicion, whim, worries, tension, sudden emotions.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Death due to mental weakness</p>
<p class="Text">There is a news of London—A peon of a college of Everdin University lost his life only by the sounds of shrieking in anger and slanders of the streets. The matter was that he used to make true and false complaints of the students misbehaviour to the higher officials. Due to this mental weakness of back-biting, he became piercing spike in the eyes of the students.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Conquer the ill motives and remain cool and peaceful</p>
<p class="Text">A man should remain always cautious from such mental emotions and provocations. Whenever there is attack of these enemies of mind, let the mind be cool and composed and overpower the reverse circumstance and control patiently. </p>
<p class="Text">In our mind demonical propensities, morbid feelings and divine traits, modesty and virtues are talent, modest and nobility are lying asleep. If the demons wake up, they should be controlled by self restraint and self discipline. </p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">Don’t lose patience in odd situation</p>
<p class="Text">When a man dies, the mind trembles with fear, the tragic news of death is painful to hear. When we return from the funeral ground after funeral rite, our mind remains restless for many days.</p>
<p class="Text"> Not one-two, ten-twenty or one and two thousand persons but if twenty thousand persons commit suicide per year, it should be considered a serious situation.</p>
<p class="Text">Such an odd situation is there throughout the world. </p>
<p class="Text">The famous newspapaer of America—‘New York Times’ has published a survey report recently which reveals the fact that every year, about twenty thousand Americans commit suicide. This survey report has become the cause of worry in America.</p>
<p class="Text"> The report says that there are several cases of death that cannot be called suicide whereas they are the cases of only suicide and nothing else.</p>
<p class="Text">According to the report in America suicide is one of the first ten causes of death and as far as the youths are concerned, it is one of the five causes.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">A glimpse on the causes</p>
<p class="Text">In which month the highest number of deaths occur?</p>
<p class="Text">The American survey department has found out that the highest number of suicides are committed in the month of December and specially in the days of the Christmas. </p>
<p class="Text">It seems to be a matter of great astonishment? The Christmas is the festival of joy and happiness for the English people. Well! Why these deaths in the month of happiness? Listen to the reasons—</p>
<p class="Text">The Americans make the retrospection of their activities of the whole year in this month. What was done in the whole year? In how many matters were they successful and in how many matters they got failures? What were the facilities or the financial problems? In business, what was the loss or gain? They retrospect all the accounts of their work. They are materialists. They live the life on the principle of ‘Eat, drink and be merry lest we may die anytime. Most of them become depressed getting failure in their material purposes. Most of them are left alone by the false friends and even by their wives. They begin to hang around them who are endowed with the materialistic comforts and objects. Mostly, the Americans being afflicted by this disappointment and lonliness commit suicide.</p>
<p class="Text">Some more reasons as follows—</p>
<p class="Text-Black">1. Want of self-confidence—</p>
<p class="Text"> The mental patients of suicide consider this life short-lived, purposeless and meaningless. They think that the materialistic circumstances can dash them to dust easily. They don’t have their own identity. Man is a toy of fate. This lack of confidence creates cowardiceness in them.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">2. The loss of enthusiasm—</p>
<p class="Text">The minor adverse situations disturb the enthusiasm of their lives. First their efforts are half-heartedly performed, and then next they don’t have patience. They connect their failures with meaningless reasons whereas the want of their sincere effort is the chief cause of their failure.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">3. Domestic problems—</p>
<p class="Text">The quarrels among the women, the disputes between the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law the difference of opinion between the father and son, habit of intoxication, the sexual lust, and to deviate soon from the mental disorders. Mental and ligamentary defilements unable to marry the children properly, unemployment of the son, more children and the social conventions are the reason of suicides.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">4. Economic problems—</p>
<p class="Text">The enhanced expenditures of the modern time, showy life, modern fashions for the false show, so much money is needed which cannot be met out. Because of the unfulfilled false needs, the troublesome problems are created and the life becomes a burden.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">5. The passion of strife—</p>
<p class="Text">Nowadays, in the Western countries, the people are intoxicated with the madness of war and strife. They try to solve the problems by strife and quarrel and by the violent methods instead of adopting the peaceful means. As a result they always remain in tension.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">6. The racial discrimination—</p>
<p class="Text">The feelings of high and low between the whites and black and the complex of superior and inferior, poor and rich fill the mind with jealousy and hostility.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">7. Mental tension—</p>
<p class="Text">The tension of mind, to remain absorbed in meaningless thinking and inner mental conflict and struggle in brain makes the life quite unstable and restless.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">8. The addiction of intoxicating medicines and wine—</p>
<p class="Text">The people have started using mostly the intoxicating medicines now-a-days to win over worries and mental troubles. It keeps mind hot and the man happens to do something otherwise in excitement.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">9. The chiefest cause—</p>
<p class="Text">Disbelief in Almighty and the other world, the desire of the materialistic joys and comforts and discontentment in all the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">You are the centre of energy</p>
<p class="Text">If anyone of the reasons mentioned above is created in your mind, you should be careful at once. Nobody knows when being dominant this poisonous situation, may assume the form of suicide. </p>
<p class="Text">In the early morning sitting peacefully, ponder over calmly again and again on the following thought and instil it in your secret mind—</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘अहमिन्द्रो न परा जिग्ये।’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Rigved  10/48/5)</p>
<p class="Text">It means—‘I am the centre of energy. I can never be defeated in life.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘I am not to be deviated from my path due to minor botherations. I am never to be overpowered by the horrible situations. The hardships come and pass away like storm. I am the unmoved, steady and stable rock in the storms. The dreadful circumstances or any misery cannot assail any harm to me. They come to test me but I am never defeated by them.</p>
<p class="Text">‘My self-confidence is great. It is never disordered by the common wants and a little miseries. I have unwavering faith in the eternal power of the Lord. God’s potency is always with me. It protects me always like armour. I am never nervous due to my troubles; I think of means to solve them one by one. I find out the reasonable solutions of the problems. </p>
<p class="Text">‘My life is secure. The great energy of the Lord is being exposed in me. I will face all the adversities like a hero.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Daily, roar this resolve like a lion. By this nectareal thought daily morning and evening while going to sleep on bed, your self-confidence will become strong and firm. Keep on your self-confidence growing. Your self-confidence is to save you from all kinds of miseries, fear and grief. It is expected from a wiseman to contemplate about his own abilities, moral virtues, prosperity and courage always. </p>
<p class="Text">The dark clouds cannot stay long in the sky, similarly, the problems of life are also momentary. The man who has faith in the benedictory Lord, his life is protected from different kinds of calamities, ignorance, attachment. aversion and worries.</p>
<p class="Text">Who is spared from troubles? Who is free from disease? Who is safe from being harassed by the botherations? Who is free from death, disease, sorrow? If you minutely mark, every one is suffering from the worries.</p>
<p class="Text">But the brave, never care for them. They continue always making the right effort for the raising up their fortitude and progress.</p>
<p class="Text">To remain fixing your eyes towards bright future and continuing practice to make it practical, is the way to get rid of the odd situations.</p>
<p class="Text">Whenever the undesirable thought of fear, cowardiceness, defeat comes to our mind by creating the contrary thought of courage, spirit, vitality and being victorious in struggle, we should be free from the unfavourable situation.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">Don’t be perturbed worthlessly</p>
<p class="Text">You have to travel by train. It is still one hour for the train to arrive but why is this palpitation in your mind? Worry and nervousness have upset you. You have the fear in your mind for the train to depart one hour earlier. You are not free from this worry till you step in the compartment of the train; your mind remains filled with different kinds of worry for example—the worry to buy the ticket, the worry of pick-pocketting or the theft of your luggage, the fear of not getting the accomodation in the train; the fear of the arrival of the train before time, the fear of your watch being slow, the doubt of the collie’s non-availbility, the worry of missing the connecting train.</p>
<p class="Text">Such types of many worries make you off the rails. You hurriedly proceed and forget a few things even on the way, you lose the money or sometimes you forget to give necessary information to someone. When you reach the station, you came to know that the train is still late to arrive. Again the nervousness starts! Whether the suitable berth will be available or not? Will I be able to load all my luggage in the compartment? Is the weight of the luggage under the limit of the ticket or more? The worry of the ticket of your small child worries you that he might be arrested by the ticket-checker as you think that you have not purchased his ticket considering him under age.</p>
<p class="Text">The train arrives at the platform and you find that your all the worries were meaningless. All the feelings of your nervousness were useless. Due to false imaginary fears you were upset in your mind.</p>
<p class="Text">You will be astonished to know that there are some such persons also who have no care of catching the train at all. They have already taken the information about the train by which they have to travel but when the moment of catching the train comes close, they remain sitting silently and so carelessly as if they have not to go to the station. It seems that if they are even in sleep, they can catch the train. Such men are mentaly so strong that their daily routine and their different activities are not disturbed at all by anyway, this is simply an example.</p>
<p class="Text">There are different spots of nervousness. For the examinees, in the examination hall most of the examinees forget half of the question paper due to the hidden fear. As soon as; they enter the examination hall the heart beating starts. They forget half of the portions they have learnt. In the palpitation, they write wrong even what they know. For a doctor nervousness is very dangerous. At the time of operation if he becomes nervous seeing the deteriorating condition of the patient, the patient’s death is certain. If the drivers of train, motor car or motorcycles, the Rikshaw-pullers become mentaly disturbed, it is not known how many accidents will take place. When an orator stands to give a speech or an actor starts playing his role and just before he becomes nervous, he will fail badly.</p>
<p class="Text">In every sphere of life, the nervousness is harmful and dangerous. Becoming nervous is also a kind of mental weakness. So, a man should understand its characteristics well and make effort for its remedy.</p>
<p class="Text">In the society and world the dreadful situations arise. The root of nervousness is not there but it lies hidden in the mind of the man. Unstability, dissatisfaction, disease, fickleness are dependent on unhealthy atmosphere and they are not dependent on the outer world. </p>
<p class="Text">A man becomes nervous to see a dreadful situation but the other one faces it boldly and bravely due to his mental balance and to the best of his capacity. According to the doctrines of Western psychologists, the root of all the outer actions of man lies in his ulterior mind. This ulterior mind is very active, swift, powerful and very strong and capable. It guides the Supreme mind and body from inside. If any fear has occupied its place in the interior of mind (Generally in childhood) as a result, evil thoughts and evil instincts remain creating fear. The most secret dangerous effect of fear is there on body. Very harmful changes come in us. We usually have the adverse imaginations of the dangerous fruits. To see others being nervous, we also become the victim of nervousness like contagious diseases. Nervousness is the polluted reaction of the mental complex of the intricate fear. The root of this habit is found in the man’s initial life, family circumstances and emotional feelings and experiences.</p>
<p class="Text">Minutely observe and think how the cowardly habit of nervousness was formed? What were fears that frightened you in the childhood? Who were to tease you, to frighten you, to threaten you and to cause you trouble? How many times did your teachers rebuke you and reproach you? How did the step-mother misbehave with you? What were the deeds where you got failures?</p>
<p class="Text">If you get your psycho analysis performed by any learned psycho analyst, he will tell you the cause of the complex of your mind. He will tell what are the reasons of disappointing and entangled complex of your mental feelings. The child whom you always rebuke and reproach, threaten or discourage and torture, his entire potential productivity becomes crippled. From the very childhood he becomes pessimistic and indolent. He suffers from the inferiority complex and shyness badly from the very childhood. He feels shameful in triffling matters even and he hesitates to express his true words even before others. The ill-treatment with him spoils his self-confidence. It is here, he develops the habit of nervousness. He becomes devoid of the strength to fight against the odd and adverse circumstances.</p>
<p class="Text">So, this is the duty of the parents, teachers and guardians that they should never make the undue harassment of the children. They should make them realize their mistakes with love and affection. They should not rebuke them so badly, that they may lose their ambitions of life and become worthless forever, they may not be deprived of the instinct to fight the adverse circumstances.</p>
<p class="Text">Contrary to it, the sense of leadership should be developed and encouraged among the children. The old fables of strengthening their self confidence, the secret reasons of their small victories, their grand successes, the full appreciation of the courageous deeds even in the odd situations and whole-hearted appreciation and praise should be made with open heart.</p>
<p class="Text">The famous scholar of psychology Shri Lalji Ram Shukla has written that to humiliate the small children for anything is just like to create the feeling of nervousness in them. Such a child remains always afraid of being humiliated by other. So, he dares not meet the strangers or do any new work. It is common that sometimes the elders laugh at the child on any matter. If the child asks any question in the class, the teachers neglect them. Thus, the child feels ashamed of. Then, he loses his courage to open his mouth before others. Sometimes the child feels shy before all for his any mistake. His experiences also prove very unpleasant. He tries to forget his bitter experiences and forgets also. But such experiences make him weak forever. At the time of examination he becomes so nervous that he fails to write the answers of the questions. This is the bad result of the nervousness of his mind. So, it is clear by this instance that we should never rebuke or reproach the students and give contrary indication. We should not give a long speech of criticism for their mistakes. Bitter experiences should not be expressed before them again and again.</p>
<p class="Text">Know the real cause of your nervousness by the analysis of your mind. Fresh the old memories again and again. Having come to know the cause of nervousness, it can be removed wisely and intelligently. </p>
<p class="Text">If you go through these causes seriously, you will find that it was all your imaginary feeling and there was the least truth in it.</p>
<p class="Text">The reasons that make you to think uselessly and make you nervous in reality have not to happened ever, though you have become very old.</p>
<p class="Text">The present wise thoughts, the healthy indications or suggestions given to the hidden mind and the behaviour full of self-confidence are the three infallible weapons that can make us to get rid of our habit of nervousness. By these three means our self-confidence can be promoted and strengthened. As our self-confidence increases so the habit of nervousness decreases. </p>
<p class="Text">We become nervous so because we don’t make the preperation of the work to the best of our capacity and strength. The world requires the full preperation and in depth. The work done half-heartedly, being unsuccessful, damages our confidence. The nervousness starts. Whatever the work taken in your hands needs prior full mental and intellectual preperation for it and ready for all the circumstances whether adverse or favourable, whatever is possible. The full preperation will never leave any room for nervousness. Why will the man who is ready to face all the situations good or bad, feel palpitation? They are the thieves who feel heart-beating, fear, escape and feel shame. When you are well prepared, most of the weaknesses are over. Make full preperation before you take any work in your hands to accomplish. The contrary feeling of nervousness is ‘calm and peaceful emotion.’ Those who assume the peaceful and steady mental disposition root out the nervousness. We should form the mental habit of growth in the calm and steady condition of the mind. While doing any work we should be cool minded. The hidden self instructions of peace should be conveyed to the hidden mind. Go on contemplating so always.</p>
<p class="Text">‘I accomplish every work peacefully. I never do any work in hurry being overcome by imaginary useless fears, I am at peace, in supreme peace and steady, my mental balance is always right. I know that I can make progress only when I am free from fickleness. I never feel nervous; because I am healthy, happy and carefree in the potency of the Lord. By the power and initiation of God whatever is auspicious and stable for me, it will be so. Any storm or hardship cannot affect my peace of mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Continue inspiring your hidden mind in this way again and again. Day and night by rooting this sentiment in your mind your mental condition will be balanced. Visualize in your mind such peaceful persons, sages, learned men, thinkers as if you want to be peaceful yourself. The images of such great men inspire and encourage you in the state of nervousness.</p>
<p class="Text">Use your fancy in right direction; it means sketch such an auspicious and valorous painting of mind by imagination that you may see your that successful form in that painting. The picture of successful and peaceful life that you see on the canvas of your imagination will be certainly practical in your life. Suppose! You feel nervous while giving a speech. Now sketch the picture of a big meeting in your mind and imagine yourself giving a speech fluently before that big gathering. By the mental practice of success and peace, you will be able to accomplish it in your practical life certainly. </p>
<p class="Text">Do the work with peaceful, steady and cheerful mind. Don’t think yourself unfit for any work beforehand. Speak slowly and slowly. Do only one work at a time. It may be possible for you that you may be nervous to see many works before you; and you may feel tired due to a hidden fear. If the works are completed slowly and slowly, the mind does not feel too much burdened and disturbed.</p>
<p class="Text">Have confidence and firm resolve in your mind for the successful completion of the work. The work you are taking in your hand will be certainly, completed successfully, This bent of mind awakens your potency to get the success in the work. Have the constant thought of your characteristics, energy, capacity and your divine qualities. Even by mistake, don’t think of your weakness and shortcomings in your mind; otherwise you will feel nervous more and more. By thinking of the weaknesses, the worthless thought of self-remorse comes to our mind and it causes weakness. First, take small works in your hands where you can be successful. Then taking the hard and difficult work in hand, you should complete it successfully. It will develop confidence in yourself.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">The root cause of your nervousness is the imaginary accumulated fear of your hidden mind. So you must do what you think you cannot do, you must meet those whom you fear, hesitate or feel shy to meet. By its practice, the hidden fear of mind is washed away. So, gladly and fearlessly greet the difficulties and hardships.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">The golden clues of the protection at the terrible time of miseries</p>
<p class="Text">The life faces big earthquakes of hard time sometimes in the life. Unexpected sudden storm of calamity and miseries, death, tragic news make most of the persons extremely restless. Sometimes the ghost of fear appears before our mind. The life seems to be badly tangled in dangers. It seems that the life will be shattered forever. </p>
<p class="Text">At the time of such dangerous situation man is struck with amazement. The intelligence does not work. He becomes at a wit’s end. He becomes disappointed or being agitated, he speaks such words for which he repents later on.</p>
<p class="Text">Sometimes, we commit such actions in the excitement that we did not want to do actually or we did not mean so. Once an officer used some bitter words for the clerk. The clerk was enraged so much that he threw the files upon the officer’s face. It resulted that he was relieved from the service and he remained repenting for the whole life.</p>
<p class="Text">William Leyan Pheleps is quite true in version—</p>
<p class="Text">To keep the mind peaceful and cool in the adverse days is very useful for man. It saves us from many bad fruits. Let us see the most successful and affluent men around us and change our life afflicted with distress and perturbation accordingly.</p>
<p class="Text">Some men have struggled the sufferings very patiently. They have found out their own ways. Some ways are being given here for example—</p>
<p class="Text">Rules—(1) Mark the experiment of Field Marshal Bycount Smith to remove the tension of mental agony. Once, he had to face a big defeat in the war. He was trying to find out any such a way as he might inspire courage and zeal among his soldiers so he began his speech in the following way—</p>
<p class="Text">‘The result might be more horrible,’ he said. </p>
<p class="Text">‘How?’ a soldier asked the question.</p>
<p class="Text">‘It was possible that it might rain even!’ just laughing he said. All came to laugh hearing his smiling answer. The tension was minimised. </p>
<p class="Text">When you are also ever in hardship minimise your mental tension smiling. ‘Laugh’ itself is a nectarial remedy, which makes the body light spreading in the whole body. It makes the life lively.</p>
<p class="Text">You, too, should use ‘Laugh’ and ‘smile’.</p>
<p class="Text">Rule—2. A professor was giving his lecture in a higher class. He was mentaly nervous. He was speaking very fast saying the matters hurriedly. In hurry, he forgot the writer’s name of the drama on which, he was giving coments. He tried his best but could not recollect the name. A clever student of the class comprehended the mistake. Abruptly it came to his mind that hurry should be avoided in troubles, so without any fear, he went on arguing and discussing. As he got the interval of mind, his mind pacified and he was able to recollect the writer’s name—the name was Sir James Verry. Now, what was there? With a courage he told the name of the writer. His shyness was removed. He was escaped scarcely from a great disrespect. </p>
<p class="Text">So, stop for a little while. Make your mind cool and balanced. In hurry it is possible, you may commit such an error which may not be corrected later on. Suppress your mentality of doing anything in excitement in hurry. You will be saved from foolishness certainly. </p>
<p class="Text">So, let some time pass. Let the matter be pacified.</p>
<p class="Text">Rule—3 While conversing with others we want to cling to our thought with our own point of view only and stick to our view badly in discussion. We should not deviate the least. On the other side the other one also does not want to deviate from his obstinacy and his logic. It results so, that the tension continues. </p>
<p class="Text">The shop-keeper wants to bring round the customer but the customer does not want to give up his obstinacy. Nobody wants to be humiliated by withdrawing his words. But if you do so you will make the otherone your enemy.</p>
<p class="Text">A successful merchant told me,—‘The secret of my success is that I allow my customers to express their views to their best. I never dominate them. I satisfy their egotism. I only hint and allow them full opportunity to think over. By doing so I don’t lose my customer.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Don’t try to dominate others. Never hurt their ego.</p>
<p class="Text">Rule—4 Hearing our bitter criticism and ill our temper goes out of control. Some are so much excited that they lose the balance of their mind. </p>
<p class="Text">Recently I met a psycho-expert doctor. I asked—‘You have to meet several lunatics and men of disbalanced mind. What do you do?’</p>
<p class="Text">He said—‘It is possible only to hear our own criticism. If we take it in our mind that it has not been uttered for me. By this way, the psycho patient is annoyed with some one else on some other issue from his friend, from any member of his family or from any official. He makes me merely the scapegoat to vent his spleen on me.</p>
<p class="Text">You should also keep in mind that half of the population of the world and specially the women are either mad or immature. They seem to us strange and we are strange to them. Then, why should we be disturbed uselessly considering their utterence ill?</p>
<p class="Text">Rule—5 Gordon Kuper was flying by an aeroplane in the sky when his plane developed some problem. He writes that he did his best possible; used automatic control but the plane could not be controlled. First, I made my mind balanced peacefully. Then, I used the outer manual control. We do all this always usually in the beginning. I found that the plane was controlled. I got down safely. Since then, I realised that by the simple and common things and means the grand result can be achieved.</p>
<p class="Text">In the hours of peril, you should bear firmness in your mind and think over the way with cool mind to get rid of the hardships. Take it granted, if you are free from perturbation, it is undisputed fact the solution of the problem will come out.</p>
<p class="Text">There is no such difficulty, which may not be overcome. In life, never accept defeat. Disentangle knots of entangled difficulties. Don’t talk of your inferiorty or defeat—</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">The downfall of the society can be checked by this way</p>
<p class="Text">The sorrow is being expressed from place to place in the country regarding the moral decline. The new methods of cheating or deceit, fraud, theft, false advertisements somewhere adulteration in food materials somewhere bribery somewhere black marketing somewhere partiality are coming to our notice.</p>
<p class="Text">It is practically impossible to get pure milk, ghee, flour, curd and medicine etc., in the market. Everywhere there is adulteration of the spurious objects. In our country, the businessmen don’t realise that the business flourishes by honesty and by selling the pure materials. Black-marketing, not to pay the sales-tax, illegal business with the foreign countries like Pakistan etc., less weighing, by telling more price and after high haggling to charge less, showing the superior quality of sample and then giving the object of inferior quality, corrupting the originality by mixing the spurious object, the attempt to cheat the customers, are the different shapes of the downfall of the business.</p>
<p class="Text">Generally in the newspapers off and on the news of moral decline are published. In one year, only in Bombay the Anti-corruption Bureo lodged 243 cases of corruption and ignoble conduct including against 67 Govt. officials also. Out of them in 26 cases, 35 Govt. officials were arrested on the charge of taking bribe, embezzlement or grabbing money by illegal means.</p>
<p class="Text">The news report of the last 11th December 58 of Saharanpur says that 14 grain merchants, one Railway booking clerk and four brokers of Saharanpur were arrested in so called charge of sending the rice valuing rupees two Lakh out of the state. The illegal business of intoxicating objects has come in practice openly. It is published generally in the newspapers, several news of making illegal wine, or bringing opium by stealth selling drugs prepared from hemp plants and its leaves are in practice openly.</p>
<p class="Text">Just cast your sight on the monthly crime report of the Bombay Police. In the last of the month 103 cases came to light. Out of them 29 cases were related to the crime of drugs, 3 cases were related to gambling, 61 cases of driving the car without license and rest 10 were different cases of crime; for example the black marketing of cinema tickets, cheating, personal use of the Govt. property, the theft of building materials, pressing the women for prostitution and selling them.</p>
<p class="Text">All these immoral deeds are done due to the lust and greed of earning money easily without any labour. A number of persons have the desire of a prosperous and wealthy life and they want all the worldly objects of comforts and enjoyment, but they don’t want to earn honestly and with labour. As a result, they always think of any new method of cheating and deceit. </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Why do the people become depraved? </p>
<p class="Text">The addiction of making money without any labour is very bad. When a man is demoralised once and forms the bad habit of parasitic living, shirkering, cheating he never takes interest in permanent work.</p>
<p class="Text">Some people feel proud of their dignity in showing themselves more than their status or showing their higher social status, Despite being internally hollow, they want to show their position superior outwardly to keep the society in dark. There are some who are unrestraint in the addiction of taking wine, in the satisfaction of their sexual desires, fashion and the habit of luxurious comforts. The moral earning is always limited. Their mind remains always restless to meet their extra additional expenditures. They always think of the sources to increase their income so that they may fulfil their lustful desires and maintain ostentatious life. </p>
<p class="Text">In the modern age of unemployment it is hard nut to crack to increase the income honestly. In addiction; the man shirks from labour and wants to enjoy the pleasures without labour. He uses his wit in finding out the way that he may increase his income just double without taking trouble of doing any work or doing the minimum possible labour. In this matter he goes beyond the limit of propriety or justification. Momentry enjoyment and greed deludes his discrimination. </p>
<p class="Text">The social cause of moral decline is the attitude of false show, spirit of ostentarian false pride, the fulfilment of passionate and sexual desires or the madness after fashion and unnecessary craving or greed. A corrupt person’s mind remains always filled with greed that leads him towards illegal means. Some persons have the natural criminal tendency of theft. There are some of lustful nature who are fond of drinking wine, prostitution and passionate objects of hotels. Some satisfy their ego with extra- vagancy. All of them are the mental patients.</p>
<p class="Text">Extravagancy, luxuriousness and comfortability is a big flaw of the showy society. It is not limited only to the rich and capable group but is stretched to the middle and labour class; clerk and the officials also.</p>
<p class="Text">As much the false tendency of showing rich is found today, was never found so much in the past. The people are not satisfied with their honest income; they always think of the means to become rich abruptly in a single day (which are usually immoral). They do speculation, gamble, decieve others by so many ways, cheat others and perform corrupt practices and try to take bribe.</p>
<p class="Text">In the cities, the tendency to show false splendour and false show is prevalent everywhere. You can mark it on the streets, roads, in the parks, temples and mostly on the occasions of marriage functions. The fashion show and status show is perhaps most popular. The tendency among the young boys and girls to decorate and beautify themselves is growing by leaps and bounds unrestraintly. The people want to impress their grandeur on others to spend more than their income and its bad result is in seen in the form of bankruptcy in business, several court cases of cheatings and different types of crime. Where the culprit is sentenced severe punishment for dishonesty and cheating others. </p>
<p class="Text">Our outer show should be better. We should look as rich and capitalist, This variety of make up is now leading the society towards corruption. The cheater have now started impressing on others with their false dignified identity. They want to live in a particular style, reside in grand buildings, organise parties and then there is the sway of betels and cigarattes and to meet these expances to them taking corruption seems the only simple means.</p>
<p class="Text">A group of persons which is poor inside but shows that they are rich. This lower middle class tries to cover their poverty by all means. They have already spent their income before earning. They remain always indebted to either of the grocer or of cloth merchant. They fail to pay the electricity bill. The room rent is always due but even then, they organise banquets for their friends and they will never minimise their expenses in giving gifts etc. How long will the friends and relatives remain with them? Only till they are badly entangled with the debt and its payment goes beyond limit. The moment he became helpless under the burden of debt, such opportunistic friends become invisible and start hating the indebted man. None has any regard for him.</p>
<p class="Text">We have become slave of fashion. We see through others eyes, we think through others mind. We do what pleases others. We don’t do according to our means, according to our status or according to our income. We are slave to superstitions. We are  bent upon acting as is the custom of giving and receiving? When we have no money at all in our pocket and we mortgage our house. We don’t consider independently and never think pros and cons. Without the consideration of the class we belong to, we follow blindly the higher status. The society separates after tumultuous applauding for two days and we remain burdened with the debt throughout the life. It has become our misconception that if we put on such clothes or remain in make up and follow the vogue of the society, only then, we will deserve respect. Being enmeshed in foolishness we desire to live the life of that class, which is of higher status, higher income, wealthier and better welloff.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, a number of wise and educated persons even move towards sorrow, helplessness, suicide, agitation, crime and corruption. By the food adulteration, bribe from others, they cheat the innocent public deceitfully. They cheat by different ways. They get false advertisements published and don’t hesitate in committing robbery and murder. By committing theft repeatedly, they become habitual of doing so. Seeing a corrupt man well-dressed up the others also change themselves in the same colour. They also follow the same immoral means. The one corrupt person makes another one corrupt.</p>
<p class="Text">The money earned by dishonest means is like poison. Who earn money by immoral and evil means. Poison is present all around them.</p>
<p class="Text">The wealth earned by immoral means stays long only for eight to ten years and the entire wealth is destroyed just when the eleventh year starts. </p>
<p class="Text">Saint Tolostoy considered wealth as sin because of several evils are inherent in wealth. His wife preferred the luxurious life of eating, drinking, fondness for delicious dishes and outer show. She always used to put up the new demands of new fashions. Thus, due to the dissimilarity in their nature and view, their life had become sinful. If in his place, there had been any other one of weak self-confidence, he could have become corrupt to please his wife. He could resort to the conspiracy of robbing people by deceit, cheating, fraud, knavery and hypocrisy; Tolostoy had a great hatred for corruption. He did not deviate from the path of truth and morality. In the age of eighty-two, being tired of his wife’s strife, he abandoned his home. </p>
<p class="Text">It is true that they are great fortunate who treat the wealth as their servant. They, who are the servant of wealth are very unfortunate.</p>
<p class="Text">Out of so many pious objects, the fair means of earning money is the best. </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Our society, responsible of moral downfall</p>
<p class="Text">Who should be blamed for corruption? Whether the individual or the society? You will say that it is the individual who commits theft, treachery, fraud, cheating, adulteration and takes bribe. So, it is the individual responsible for this, the individual is to be blamed for. </p>
<p class="Text">In my opinion, the individual is not so much responsible for the corruption as much as the society. The society always influences the individual. In every society there are some customs and traditions and some definite rules and regulations. The individual is bound by them. Every individual of the society wants to follow the customs and traditions which have due importance in the society and which are considered good or bad in the society in natural way. He feels exalted of following them.</p>
<p class="Text">In the society there are some who lead a very simple life, but there are some such arrogants who have nothing in their pockets, but they boast of being well off by living a showy and ostentatious life outwardly. They maintain make up with artificial ornamental objects. They are outwardly something and inwardly something else, When they maintain make up, the society gives them due honour. They move in the society with a social status. The men of common status also imitate them to see their make up and luxuries. They are attracted to their fascinating life. Everything in the society goes on by imitation. One after another, well! Only this fascinating life is causing trouble everywhere.</p>
<p class="Text">The luxurious and fashionable life of the big men in the society creates the feeling of jealousy among the men of lower income. He is unable to meet his expenditure with the limited income. So, he always remains mentaly dissatisfied. Anywhere you cast your look, you will find a common complain of low income because he does not want to live under the limit of his income and social status and makes an unsuccessful effort to imitate the lives of rich, landlords, feudal chieftains, kings of higher status.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The suggestions to check the moral downfall</p>
<p class="Text">The moral downfall is a social disease. It is only the society that can solve this problem. If the society makes effort, the corruption can be rooted out very soon. Such functions in the society should be banned, which arouse the sense of jealousy and imitation of the rich class of persons in the minds of people of small incomes or that functions that prompt to increase the expenditures of false and unnecessary show. In the marriage functions where irrelevant expenditures are made for sake of only show, dealings the show of dowry, all these encourage others also for undue extra expenses. If anyone spends ten thousand the otherone plans for fifteen thousand to show him down and the third one tries to find out any other plan to show his position better than others. Curse to the social copying and imitation that keep us deprived of the living truth! And keep us restrained from exposing our reality! Or it may be said in other words that while exposing our real position, we may feel ashamed. Either the dowry should not be given at all or if given the transaction should be made through cheque which should be without any show of status-symbol. In the marriage, the daughter’s education, abilities and qualities, her moral conduct and health are on priorty. Money is completely subordinate. If there is no show of dowry then who will feel proud of giving dowry?</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Beauty-adornments should not be given importance</p>
<p class="Text">Today, when we observe the women life, we find the fault of society there also. Why is a young lady fond of decent royal garments, nylone sarees of quite new colours and attractive prints, and new designed ornaments? Why does she want to look in new fashions? Why does she use creams, powder, lipsticks on her face? Why is she so keen in looking so charming?</p>
<p class="Text">The reason behind it is that she thinks that she will get the honour of the society by the use of these adornments. It is her understanding that a wife is auspicious to be in the decorated fashions and in the adorned look. That simpleton lives in such a society where to look fashionable and adorned with jewellery is considered to be good; and to remain in half-naked dress, the Western countries are imitated and followed blindly. The society gives more importance to those beauty adornments and fashions; The society gives  respect. </p>
<p class="Text">In the craze of the social importance the simpleton woman gives up the use of several objects useful and necessary for life. She uses vegetable ghee in place of pure ghee, tea in place of milk but she spends freely for beauty adornments and fashionable garments. The fault goes to the society that accord states to the person on the basis of wrong measures outward show misleads the people.</p>
<p class="Text">The public mind does not think seriously going into the depth of the objects. Their mind is immatured. It is influenced by the only outer show. The individual’s life is valued on the basis of his outer appearance. So, it is the need of the time to ban pretentious show.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Cinema should be abhorred</p>
<p class="Text">The young boys and girls see the heros and heroines of cinema being honoured by the society as well as the government. The photos of the well decorated heroines are published with a great elegance. The newspapers attract the public attention towards them by publishing their interesting reports. The youths move with the newspapers decorated with the heroines pictures. In the rooms of the houses and in the offices their photos are pasted on the walls or the calenders of their photos are hung on the walls for decoration and honour. When the youths, whether male or female see this honour given to them by the public, the girls also want themselves to become like them. The crime of misguiding them is done by them who have diverted the immatured minds towards the evil paths by giving undue honour to them. </p>
<p class="Text">The society has given more importance to the cinema in the daily public life. Cinema has become a very important part of our daily life. The students of immature mind saw the romance and adventures in the films. They imitated them. As a result this class became voluptuous and romantic. The feelings of indiscipline, fashion, sexuality and hooliganism were aroused in the student’s minds.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, there is the need to look down upon the cinema with hatred; the heroines should not be given honour. Only the man of character, knowledge and learning, nobility, hard labour etc., should be honoured. The social sanctity and honour should be awarded to them only who have risen up in life by good conduct, restraint, noble behaviour, sacrifice, penance, simplicity and modesty. Thus, to go in the right direction, to think in the right direction should be encouraged. If the society gives due honour and place, to the truthfulness and modesty, the public will make effort to develop the human virtuous qualities being deviated from the attachment of money. Their thought will be diverted towards the higher moral ideals; We will have to give a new ideal lesson to the society.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The social sanctity should be given to the healthy acts of the society only</p>
<p class="Text">The whole aim of the true education is not only to make the society devoted to righteous acts but also to develop its taste in them. The society should become pious.</p>
<p class="Text">Out of all the purities, the purity of money is the best because the pure money is that which is earned honestly; He is not pure who makes himself pure with the soil and water only.</p>
<p class="Text">A thinker has written, ‘Undoubtedly, there are such men who have become rich by the means of injustice, dishonesty, fraud, torture, cunningness, bribery and corruption and today they have become worthy of honour in the society. Know it truly that they cannot be happy and contented. Can they enjoy the least of this wealth pleasantly?</p>
<p class="Text">‘No, Never at all. Their soul rebukes them, pinches them, tortures them and afflicts them day and night.’</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The learned men should guide the right direction</p>
<p class="Text">The responsibility to change the social atmosphere goes to the learned, thinkers, writers, editors, poets, social reformers, political leaders and saints only who preach and teach them with their thoughts, letters and articles, the new thoughts to the people, the new methods of thoughts and let them know to differenciate right and wrong. By their arguments they reach to the definite decisions. Wisdom is the quality of some distinguished persons, it is the personal property of some intellectuals. If these preachers take trouble to divert the social values towards the morality diverting it from the worldly attachments, it can be very beneficial to the society. </p>
<p class="Text">Those editors, who are preaching the feeling of sexuality and romanticism, are the public enemies; those who print the romantic, exciting, passionate and attractive photos of the ladies on the front page and are pushing the youths towards sensuousness, are causing great harm to the society. The others will also become like the persons whom they give more importance. So, they should give honour and due respect to the ideal men who are raising up the moral standard of human life higher and they should honour the crest jewels of women. In their papers they should publish the narratives, occurences, stories of only those ideal men who have the ideal worth raising up others higher. The public has gone astray towards corruption to read the dirty literature, romantic tales and narratives and the literature of low grade.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">The downfall of literature is the symbol of the down-fall of the nation. That is the true literature that proves beneficial to human being, it means to make the moral uplift of human life, to stimulate the faculty of discrimination. For the mental health, discernment is as important as the health for the body. By the awakening of discrimination, man will automatically be able to discriminate right and wrong. The editors should publish such literature which may develop the reasoning power in human mind and the public may proceed ahead towards divinity. The writers should write such literature where the man may learn the lesson of self-control, he may learn to lead his life in the limited income and may learn to remain contented; He may not allow the growth of his needs, subtle desires and gross desires. By virtue of prolification of such thoughts the atmosphere will be ‘Sattvic’ residing in such atmosphere, the society will itself renounce corruption.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-13">Let them be always away from us</p>
<p class="Text">Who should accompany us? What should be away from us? These questions have always put the Indian thinkers in complexity. </p>
<p class="Text">What should be kept away from us? Our intellectuals have pondered over this question a lot; they have considered over it from many different angles, they have deeply and critically studied on this matter from all point of views. This answer is useful for the progress and development of the human life.</p>
<p class="Text">We should be far away from those things that harm us; those evils that hurt our body, mind and soul should be left afar, we should avoid those persons who generate evil in our mind through their association. Our bad habits, bad nature, anguish, disease, lamentation, worry and hostility should be away from us; because all these are unhealthy and harmful. Our scriptures have mentioned those poisonous objects that should remain quite far away from us. As the scriptures say—</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Those people should not come in our contact</p>
<p class="Text">There are numberless men of different ideals and motives, of different colours, taste, features, natures, attitudes and mental maturity, they are different in habits and living standard. Outwardly all look similar; but all are quite different from each other in their minds, intellects and nature. There is a vast difference in their behaviours like the difference between earth and sky. Some are the source of new inspirations and spirits of courage and progress in our life; and some others may be the source of poisonous habits and ill motives. So, the understanding of good and bad, superior and inferior, progressive and fallen persons is very necessary. So, you should live in the company of the persons of good and virtuous mentality and thoughts and escape from those—</p>

<p class="Text">Such men always remain busy in the condemnation of others and finding fault in them. There is no moral, worldly, trading and spiritual benefit from these at all. The mean and evil tendency of fault-finding, develops in their company.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-14">Be aware of the rumours</p>
<p class="Text">Rumour is harmful for the both individual as well as the society. Its base is the use of the imaginary power of man in the wrong direction. Fear is a strong mental impulse of man. Usually, the fear perturbs all the living beings, but the man comes to use his imagination in the wrong direction joining his intellect with fear by the rumours. Those who spread rumours, corrupt the public mind and divert them from the right path by making the irresponsible talks among the people of the vicinity and create the polluted atmosphere of terror and perturbance among the uneducated and innocent public. The public starts taking interest in the talks of fear and danger generally without thinking deeply. The innocent people reckon the fear double or four times more through their imaginary power. Sometimes, the rumours have very dangerous effect. The fear gets instilled in the mind of the public very soon and hearing the wrong informations again and again it takes the shape of mental complex.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Impact on the soldiers</p>
<p class="Text">The psychologist writer Prof. Laljiramji Shukla writes describing the reaction of the rumours—‘In the war period of hearing the false propoganda and poisonous rumours some soldiers suffer abruptly by the attack of paralysis. There is no deformation in limbs of their bodies, but they cannot be used for duty. After the mental study of such coward persons it has come to notice that they were frightened by their inner heart from the fear of the dreadful sights of the war and butchering; but they did not accept this fear outwardly. Their ambition to show their heroism to the other soldiers did not allow them to accept this fear. Such persons used to boast of their valour before other soldiers. A ball of cannon fell down before such a soldier boasting of his heroism and it burst out. Only its sight made him unconscious.</p>
<p class="Text">The cannon-ball had no hurt on his body; but as a result of fear his mouth opened. Then, he continued in the same condition. Due to fear, it was a mental paralysis in his opened mouth. When by the mental treatment the purgation of the fear hidden in his inner mind was made, his mouth could be closed then. Thus, the mental complex of imaginary fear creates extraordinary kinds of great fear in the minds of men.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The rumours are infectious</p>
<p class="Text">The mental disorders are created only by the sight, imagination and hearing of certain rumours like the infectious wicked diseases. Suppose, any party or group is interested to serve its purpose or any enemy wants to make any country coward, he starts repeating such wrong rumours again and again through his preachers, secret agents or radio, which has a very bad and poisonous effect on man’s unconscious mind. The majority of the public is innocent and uneducated. If the fear or terror have made their roots deep in the mind, the public begins to turn their imaginations towards the directions of inauspicious imaginations of downfalls, weakness, defeat, sorrow and imaginary pain etc., These inauspicious imaginations spread from individual to individual, family to family, in the streets and Mohallas in schools and then in the whole village and city. The inauspicious imaginations make the soldiers fighting in the war and the citizens worthless and impotent by creating the cowardice feeling. These rumours make even the whole city deserted. Man’s prowess, vigour, patience, courage working capacity is destroyed.</p>
<p class="Text">So, it is very necessary to be aware of the rumours in the present difficult times. Neither we should take interest in hearing the rumours nor should we share in spreading it. But it is needed that the rumours originating harmful imaginations should be repudiated at once and such thoughts which are encouraging and strengthening to the faith in the victory should be spread over among the public. By the propoganda of right and courageous thoughts the fear and confusions of the public will be swept away and even in the most horrible circumstances, they will be able to face the enemy without any perturbation.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The reason behind the victory of the Britishers</p>
<p class="Text">The burning example of a country going to be defeated in reality, how it can change the defeat into a victory is being quoted here. In the last great war, when in the war of Dankark, the British army could not stay before the Germans and when they had to cross the English channel giving in badly, the atmosphere of disappointment spread all over England. Till then, almost all the European countries hostile to Germany had already surrendered before Germany. No army could stand before Germany. So, in this hour of distress, the Britisher’s condition was miserable. If Britishers mind had not been made free from fear and disappointment and there had not been generated the petals of hopeful imagination in their mind, the Britishers would have been defeated. </p>
<p class="Text">At that critical time the public imaginations were stimulated towards the hopeful thoughts of victory. This thought was propogated that the Britisher may lose the small wars but they are always winners in the big wars. By this good thought the thought of hidden fear changed into hope. As a result, the Britishers didn’t give in before Hitler. They remained facing them boldly. The outer circumstances also favoured them. The Russians who were at daggers drawn, having joined them as friend began to fight against Germans. On the otherside, America, too, supported them with man and money. Thus, by the right use of imagination the defeat turned to victory. </p>
<p class="Text">Neither accept that of which you have no confirmation of its truth; nor say to anybody. Such matters are the origin of cowardice mind and they are harmful to the nation.</p>
<p class="Text">Those who make the mountain of a mole hill with great elation they concoct glories without head and tail. Let us be very careful from them. By spreading rumours and getting others entangled with them, they take nasty enjoyment in becoming leader achieving their objective and diverting the innocent and uneducated public from the right path.</p>
<p class="Text">It is just possible that the enemy may be spreading the rumour. So, a minute watch should be kept on those who spread such rumours or describe it in a dramatic way.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">In the war period, only the matters of the public welfare are useful. So, the auspicious imaginations of the enemy’s defeat and the victory of our nation should be made. Instead of believing in the rumours of others, find out the truth yourself.<span></span></p>

The so called fraudulent Sadhus used to show, deceitful wonderful miracles. Such fraudulents have made the religion very much defamed and caused a great harm to the innocent emotional public.

According to the police report, the young man was suspicious of his wife’s infidelity. He prayed to the goddess to reform her habits and character and desired to offer his own sacrifice. Such fools will be called a sinner only.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The human sacrifice to please God</p>
<p class="Text">The Chanda district police had arrested three Gonds on the charge of a human-sacrifice. It was their misconception that the cause of not raining was the displeasure of Indra and there was no possibility of rain without offering him human sacrifices. By leading astray a man, they took him away before the Gond-god in the dense forest and made his methodical worship and then sacrificed him. Some of his blood was offered to the god and the rest remaining was distributed among themselves.

<p class="Text">We treat the child-behaviour affectionately and fondly being considerate. They are perplexed in no time in conversation, living way, behaviour and conduct, sorrow and pain. The least problem makes them nervous. They become disturbed by the imaginary fears at once suddenly. Feeling appetite they become restless and start weeping. If their toy is broken, if they happen to see any nightmare, if they have to stay in dark, they are perturbed badly. If they are separated from the brother, sister, mother, father and put alone, they become faded and start weeping and shrieking. They quarrel on triffling matters.

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-17">The secret practice of progress</p>
<p class="Text">There are two parts of human nature—The one part of human mind is indolent, carefree, lazy, and pushing towards downfall; but the second is the part that inspires him towards progress, awakening, permanent gain and superiority. In other words it may be called the inner spirit also. Both of these parts want to dominate the man turn by turn. Its result are decided by the talent and wisdom or reason. He who is guided by reason despite the difficulties and reverse circumstances sets on the path of prosperity, glory and progress like a lotus of the mud. He who is dominated by wicked propensity or evil wit, in spite of favourable circumstances, falls down and goes towards decline. As the path of decline is sloping if he falls once, he goes on slipping to downfall. He who goes ahead towards progress, is considered ideal in the eyes of the society. People remember him only. His parents and family members don’t have the consideration of his primary conditions at all. They forget it.</p>
<p class="Text">None can be glorious or reputed for a long time on the basis of his old family reputation, property, prosperity, noble deeds, glory or richness. The element of repute lies in the man. It is his own character, habits, nature and way of action that determine his popularity. Man has his own individual importance in every direction. He has his own original way of action. This is his quality. On the basis of his this originality the people have amazed the world.</p>
<p class="Text">Numberless famous and great persons came into existence, who were in the detestable condition primarily, but they were enlightened abruptly with their distinguished characteristics, divine gift and hidden virtues in them; a kind of quite new awakening was created and they set a wonderful example of their action.</p>
<p class="Text">You will be able to understand this rule when you also come to know your qualities and virtues. The moment you recognise your worth, your life-cycle—will turn over. So, don’t be disappointed, don’t be lazy, well! Be mindful of your thoughts direction. What is your inner voice? How are your habits? Be alert of your being addicted of intoxication or you are falling into a bad company? Be careful whether you are proceeding towards progress or downfall? </p>
<p class="Text">Keep it in your mind that God exists in you and you are blessed with His potency. Mind, soul and body are the treasure of wonderful hidden powers. You are lying in the undeveloped condition and dashing the days. You are considering the life worthless, empty and purposeless. But you are born to become a very valuable man. You have come here to rule. A big goal inheres you.</p>
<p class="Text">A man can do anything if he has firm resolve. Every firm resolve has a great power. Pity it is he does not want it with firmness. If there is no will, he can do nothing. So, it is clear that first you should have a strong firm, indomitable will in you to achieve your goal. </p>
<p class="Text">Generally, the people go on the same track of their forefathers. They don’t think anew. They remain in the same condition. Their mind does not work in any new direction of progress. Their talent does not practise in the new directions. Their imaginations are not creative. In this way, they remain traditionalist. They become habituated of the family-traditional work since their birth. They understand that their luck may favour them even in their traditional profession, work or service. But several times the people made wonderful progress by adopting the professions apart from their traditional profession. Here is the point to think, contemplate and imagine on the new line. Just see the world, analyse the social activities, judge the people’s mentality study deeply their nature and tendency, concentrate your look towards new direction. Be sure that there are still a lot of new works remaining to be done and specially they are left to be done with your hands. New business, new inventions, new progress all belong to your luck. Every moment of life is a new opportunity of progress for a man who finds out a new way to prosper after a new and well consideration and contemplation with courage, enthusiasm and self-confidence.</p>
<p class="Text">There are many people of the understanding that the opportunity of uplift comes only but once. A friend of mine failed in an interview, the other gentleman’s number was eleventh, as in high rank services only ten candidates are selected. The both gentlemen are now frustrated. They say—‘What to say, my heart was broken. All the hopes of life shattered and now what is there in future for me? Now, my life got ruined. This world is useless for me. I would like to suggest such exasperated and disappointed persons that there are ups and downs at every step of life. We are bound to tolerate such bitter moments in life. On the path of life, the thorns pierce into our feet certainly, but the opportunities of progress and development are ready to welcome us not only once but a number of times. These opportunities come to us in different ways and through different means but to take advantage or to ignore it, is our right and depending on use of our intelligence. Generally, it is found that they are not utilized as they ought to be. We should be very careful to have the minute observation of the ups and downs of our life as well as of the society every day, every month and every year that whether we are proceeding ahead or going back in the field of business and in the mental, intellectual, economic, social, moral and religious field or we stand static.</p>
<p class="Text">Mind the chief points—‘Don’t be afraid of the difficulties. The path of progress is thorny at every step. It is you to make your own path. It is you to remove the pebbles and thorns of your path yourself. Difficulties should be inspiring to you, it should generate in you the new freshness and courage to move onward on the path of progress day by day constantly. Your self-confidence should be very strong. The difficulties are the best teacher in our life. Just as a wrestler grows his physical strength daily constantly slowly and slowly by wrestling with his rival, being defeated again and again, covered with dust and becomes strong, in the same way, every difficulty makes us strong and firm by anyway in case we don’t accept our defeat. We may fall down but we should rise up again having waved off our dust. He who becomes ready everytime again and again to fight a wrestling with the difficulties, possesses the higher qualities of progress, as courage, labour and effort and a new hope to win. The courageous and self-confident men are contented only after beating the difficulties—</p>
<p class="Text">A thinker’s these valuable words deserve to be saved tightly—‘In the world trouble is not impossible but it is necessary. It is sure to come, the hardships born of irresponsible and coward persons are in abundance in the world. Any of them may befall any time to oppress the weak. Not to allow the difficulties to be created from our own side and face the hardships created by others is a lofty character of man. Man should remain always ready to dash against the terrible hardships. The hardships may affect anyone either good or bad; but he who has the strong force of character the splendour of thoughts and spiritual light will overcome them smiling like the full moon of eclipse. </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">He who is weak in character, shattered and coward and black-hearted should be declared as a  suicider. He will fall down having been broken by a mild shake of the hardship like a broken star.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-18">The difficulties are beneficial also difficulties make us strong</p>
<p class="Text">As a wrestler becomes strong being knocked down again and again in the wrestling and gets physical strength in the same way in the wrestling of life, a man becomes powerful by struggling the difficulties. He adds to his self-confidence. That developed self-confidence is the root of all victories.</p>
<p class="Text">You should greet the difficulties. You should beat them by your self-confidence. The victory over your every difficulty is the constant source to increase fortitude and courage.</p>
<p class="Text">You should be always ready to meet the difficulties whatsoever may be. The more you suffer from the hardships, the more easy will be your path of progress. Difficulties make us strong.</p>
<p class="Text">You are ambitious of progress and its cost is ‘Difficulty’—If you can pay this cost, there is no delay in getting the progress and success because the object is available to him only who pays its full cost. There is no suspicion about the accomplishment of the work for him who can pay the real price in the form of labour in the right way.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Difficulties strengthen our self-confidence</p>
<p class="Text">Your circumstances might be of any sort always go on striving with your self-spirit to move onward. Don’t be nervous with the hardship and miseries. When you are successful in overcoming them, you will feel a great pleasure to see your courage and prowess exceeding. Never be in dark that you are not in gain by any certain difficulty or misery or work. It is your illusion to consider the difficulty a misery or a burden; it is your false timidity and fear which is dashing you towards down-fall. By fighting the war against the miseries and pain and to stick stubbornly against them, you will evolve yourself morally and spiritually. You will rise above the common condition of your life and the world will honour you.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The heroes unfrightened from difficulties</p>
<p class="Text">You are well known with the hardships of the prince, Gautam Buddha. He performed hard penance sitting in the caves of the mountains. Hundreds of obstacles and hardships came before him. His body turned to skleton, the violent wild beasts attacked him, he suffered cold-heat-storm etc., but he remained firm on his Sattvic resolve.</p>
<p class="Text">As emerging from the mountain the spring of fountain ultimately makes its way breaking and dashing against the stones of the hill, similarily the courageous persons of firm determination and courage at last reach their goal removing all the obstacles of their way.</p>
<p class="Text">Maharana Pratap Singh’s life is an example of a courageous fighting war against hardships throughout his life. Pratap’s life clears to wage war for freedom without any comfort and means from the opponents and constantly moving onward towards his highest goat. You are also the modern Pratap.</p>
<p class="Text">In his small age the Mughal Emperor had become his enemy. His opponents were present all around him. The greedy persons of wealth were thirsty of his life. His own well-wishers and related to him were playing in the hands of Muslim rulers. Except a handful of patriots there was none his follower. He had only courage and spiritual power with him. With its support only he blew the trumpet of freedom. This was the only ambition of Pratap’s life—the liberation of Mewar. Just imagine, without any strong support he had jumped into the great sea of Mughal army taking the strength of his own hands. Hungry and thirsty he remained wandering about from forest to forest. His wife and children were pining for food and shelter, they remained distressed, restless and suffering from hardships. Ultimately his army had been defeated but he had never lost his courage. He never felt disappointed. He used to call the hardships as the mountain of cotton to be destroyed without effort. You are also expected of the same courage, same firmness and gradual awakening of duty.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The great hero Puru</p>
<p class="Text">Sikandar was dreaming of conquering the whole world; He had overcome several hardships with courage. He was coming to India from a foreign country to rob India and subdue it under him. His army was expert and well-skilled. He had the best quality of war weapons and war materials. He had already won many states of Punjab, but he had to face such an Indian warrior, who was the crown of India. Even today he is reverent in heroism. He was the king of a small state near the Jhelum river. His name was Puru. He had faced Sikandar with his very poor strength and had harassed him. A fierce war had broken out. In the war Puru had to suffer a great loss but he had not cared even to sacrifice his life to protect the freedom of his country. Unfortunately the brave Puru was arrested but he was the embodiment of courage. Sikandar asked the arrested Puru—‘O the Prisoner! How should you be treated?’ The brave was not a man to be perturbed by the hardships. Even among the men of his enemy he remained stood fearlessly. He answered boldly—‘Treat me as a king treats to a king. An Indian brave is never afraid of difficulties.’</p>
<p class="Text">All were striken dumb to hear his bold words. Sikandar, too was amazed.</p>
<p class="Text">The Indian braves are never perturbed in hardships. You have got the blood of the same braves, the same hero deserving emotions and the same admirable heroic traditions.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Go ahead on all the fronts of life</p>
<p class="Text">Whatsoever the situations may be but there are opportunities in all the spheres of life to move ahead. There are four aspects of human life—domestic, social, cultural and spiritual. Ponder over all these aspects carefully and judge yourself where you stand. In which condition and how far are you backward? Then, start from there to go ahead. How should be your family life, your wife, your children, your relatives, kith and kin prosper? By whom should they prosper? How should you enjoy the honourable status among your friends, your acquainted ones and the society? How to advance in the field of recreation, Art, music, tours etc., with cultural point of view? How to advance in moral, religious and spiritual world? All these fields are open to you equally for progress. Solve the problems there. Take equal interest in them. Make effort to be champion in all the fields. You will find how splendid and grand your life is.</p>
<p class="Text">The victory over every hardship will give you pleasure. Learn the art to take advantage from the miseries. You don’t think of your condition yourself and so remain inactive. If you make the true effort to go ahead, knowing your weakness the progress is sure.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Those who make efforts, reach the top</p>
<p class="Text">Remember it, those men who are ambitious of progress and are courageous, fast and hard working, reach the peak; but the lazy and cowards remain there and there only. Those who don’t make effort and are deprived of viewing all the sides, pros and cons are foolish and remain always rotting themselves. By shouldering the responsibility and doing it whole-heartedly we gain strength. The bigger responsibility, one takes the higher position; glory and repute he gains, The great men have never got frightened by new and hard responsibility. High thinking, new plans and constant labour are must to become a great man. These are those factors, which have been practised by every great man.</p>
<p class="Text">They were always confident of their ability. They knew their duty. They did the work whole-heartedly. Their self-confidence is the root of their success. They, who are not confident of fulfilling their job and are doubtful in the beginning of the work, who have the false imaginations and feeling of doubts of hurdles and hardship in their hidden mind, are unable to start the work even. Those who achieve the high posts, have to face the great adversities; opposition and troubles. Many great inventors have been inventing new inventions by remaining busy in their researches throughout their lives with hard labour but their work could not be fulfilled and they passed away from the world. Some were ridiculed by their companions, they were caused trouble, created many obstacles in their experiments even the primary needs of their lives could not be fulfilled; but they remained dedicated to their work and remained trying firmly to get even a little success. In the end they got fame and renown, one to them other thousands of men got overflowed with riches. Hard earned money leads to progress.</p>
<p class="Text">Everyone wants to do something but he does not want to take any trouble or does labour to do it. He does not take whole-hearted interest to accomplish it; in other words it may be said that he sows vice and wants to reap virtue. It is sure that such false dreamers fail in their goal and blame their destiny or God for this.</p>
<p class="Text">If a man is devoted with a firm determination mentally and physically to achieve his goal, it is dead sure that he can accomplish his aim. They, who are determined in their mind to do any work, never care for obstacles and hurdles. They do not feel any obstacle. In the path of progress, the difficulties come only to the cowards and fickle-minded people. The difficulties run away before the firm determination. They do the work of a guide on the path to the progressive men, ambitious of progress.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading"> The storms are to be faced</p>
<p class="Text">Never think that your life-boat will be sailing always secure and balanced. The troublesome paths will also come across. The pebbles, stones and thorns will also pierce. There will be blow of wind and storms also. The suffering will also clash. Actually all these occur to test your firmness. Be careful lest the rush should dash you.</p>
<p class="Text">In the path of progress, fear and doubts are such mental demerits which detain a man far behind. Fear whispers your ear—don’t do so otherwise it may be defective. Your entire prowess will be fruitless. </p>
<p class="Text">On account of this doubt in place of doing our duty sincerely and perfectly, we lose it. Because of the doubtful and suspicious mentality, we build such walls around us that we fail to find any gate to go out. In such a declined situation we can never progress.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">For the accomplishment of any big work and progress we have the great need of courage, firm determination and fearlessness. To initiate and awaken the prowess, latent in our mind, in the ancient time the Gurus used to say in the ear of the pupil— You are the form of ‘Brahma; root this mantra in your hidden mind. Say with full self-confidence—‘I am the form of Brahma. I am the brave son of the Lord. I will not sit without attaining the high status.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-19">The sensitive nature is very harmful for life</p>
<p class="Text">The great poet of English Literature John Keats died in his blossoming young age of 27. He was not suffering from any disease. The circumstances of his death period were somewhat as follows. </p>
<p class="Text">Keats was a well versed poet. He used to compose romantic poems. All appreciated his poems open-heartedly. He had an honourable position in the poetic world.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, by chance, a destructive article against him was published in a critical magazine. It had been written in personal enmity and jealousy. Here, he had been indulged in false denunciatory remarks. He had been blamed for false and baseless allegations only to defame him and take revenge of the old hostility. Keats read this criticism and it had a dangerous effect on his sensitive mind. He fell ill due to this mental agony and died in his prime age being the patient of T.B. </p>
<p class="Text">Just, imagine, in the prime of youth, when the people enter the active field of life by ceremonising the wedding, in the same young age that poor emotional poet died on account of his sensitive nature. Such an unimportant reason, the baseless criticism and the weakness of the poet that considering it true he got mentaly disturbed and frustrated inwardly! And that shock dragged him to death. It is clear that the poet had no courage and strength to tolerate his slander. He had no inner power to protect himself from the outer demoniac force. He was unaware that the sensitive nature could be the cause of death. The excess of emotion can also push into the jaws of death.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">King Dasharath died due to the severe shock of separation</p>
<p class="Text">Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram was departing to serve the banishment. The entire Ayodhya was grief-stricken. The citizens were weeping bitterly: many had fallen down being fainted. In the royal palace, the mothers were wailing pathetically in lamentation. All the family members were in tears in the grief.</p>
<p class="Text">The women are more tender-hearted than the men. Very simple matters have very bad impact on them. It was simple and natural for Kausalya, the mother of Sri Ram to be more affected by her son’s separation. Her only son was departing from her in the full young age with his wife to wander about in the forest leaving her alone lamenting. It was a very pathetic sight. The whole Ayodhya was afflicted with the dark cloud of anguish.</p>
<p class="Text">Really, the mother Kausalya and the father Dasharath both were distressed. Probably Kausalyaji was more anguished than Dasharath, but Kausalyaji was more considerate and tolerant while Dasharathji was of sensitive nature. He was very tender-hearted and emotional and his this emotion and sensitive nature took his life. He could not bear the mental shock. </p>
<p class="Text">The sensitive plant fades away only by touch. The men of such nature also come to disorder only by the mild blow of opposition, reproach, sorrow and hardships. Their mental balance is disturbed. They come to sudden perturbation. This type of emotion is a big demerit. This excess of emotion results in dreadfulness. So, being free from sensitive nature one should adopt tolerance.</p>
<p class="Text">This world is full of bad elements people resorting to Uselessly and habituals of condemnation are in abundance in the society and they are like serpents and scorpions. The thieves, robbers, crookeds, sinners and demons are used to creating obstacles even in noble deeds. The demons create disturbance in the penances of the sages. Ultimately, Maryada Purushottam Sri Ram had to use his bow against the torture.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Don’t be afraid of reproach without any reason</p>
<p class="Text">In every country of the world and in all ages all the altruistics, the benefactors of the human beings, progressive, benevolent great souls have been reproofed; that is in practice even today and will continue in future also. The mutual hostility, censure and jealousy are in the nature of the men of demoniac character. No great man or leader has escaped from censure. </p>
<p class="Text">Generally, this reproach is baseless and guided by the ill motive of revenge behind the back. Some persons of polluted mentality are jealous of your outstanding ability and virtues and so they want to create hurdle in your progress. When they, themselves fail in their motive, they provoke others by back-biting. To tolerate such baseless reproach and without any reaction of annoyance and digest the poison of reproach like the poison as Lord Shiva drank, is the great quality of man. This spirit of tolerance should be developed.</p>
<p class="Text">The great men have paid no heed to the censure. On the other hand they have taken its advantage. Censure has a great gain that the liking of the public comes to notice very easily. Mostly that, which is the liking of the majority becomes the issue of censure. The popularity expands by reproach. By the pretence of reproof, people usually try to understand the public servants. Indirectly, censure is the mental reaction of man’s popularity.</p>
<p class="Text">The reprover practises the means of back-biting because he spreads the false rumours which have no base at all. He fears to speak openly before you.</p>
<p class="Text">Anyone, ambitious of progress should not deviate from his goal by being disheartened by the short-lived baseless reproach. He who can tolerate the condemnation, is capable of bearing the great sufferings of the world.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Need not lose the mental balance at the time of censure and miseries</p>
<p class="Text">The words of Prince Vismark are the words of great experience—</p>
<p class="Text">‘At the moment of censure of any kind or at the moment of opposition, a man should protect himself from the mental shock that can make us empty of courage by causing wound to our mind like with the fall of rock. Let coolness remain pervading in our mind! Let our mind remain fully balanced! If our mind is depressed or gets frightened, it should be considered that all the arms and weapons have been snatched away, all the weapons and means to face the adversities ended.’</p>
<p class="Text">To protect the mind from the mental shock the easiest way is—‘neutrality’. In other words by making yourself neutral from the hardship, study it as if you are unconcerned and the hardship is there on the other one’s head and you are a mere spectator.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">James Allen’s example</p>
<p class="Text">The great soul, St. James Allen has written in one of his memories—I have found two men of my acquaintances whose earning of the whole life was destroyed at a time. One day, in the morning he read in the newspaper that the bank where they had their deposits, became bankrupt. Just reading this news one of them was so much shocked that his mind failed. He became mad. It was because of his excessive emotional mind.</p>
<p class="Text">But the second one who was not afraid of the adversities the least, said with a serious smile—‘Alright! God always does better for us. The earning of my whole life went now out of my hands. That money cannot be obtained again by my mourning, but yes, that can be earned again by labour. I lost my money only, at least I did not lose my hands, legs and enthusiasm. I will earn again.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Thinking so, that man again engaged himself in the work with new zeal and firm self-confidence and in a short time he became rich again; but the emotional man remained mourning weeping and beating his chest. He caught the way of disappointment instead of being industrious which made him  the victim of misery, growing day by day miserable.</p>
<p class="Text">The mind should be made tolerant.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Make the mind tolerant</p>
<p class="Text">It has been said in our culture—</p>

<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Rigved 1/147/5)</p>
<p class="Text">It means—(‘There are many persons to reproach) and to harbour malice. They who are always busy in reproofing and fault-finding in others, deserve to be left away by the understanding men because their company transforms us in a reproover.’</p>

<p class="Text">Remember it—‘The ignorant persons being overpowered by greed because of shock and sorrow (due to emotion) suffer from great distress; but the men of morality and nobility, and of firm resolve and prowess, growing their knowledge and realization become liberated from the worldly bondage and liberate others also from this worldly ocean by their examples.’</p>

<p class="Text">Remember it—‘There are all types of creatures—good and bad here in this world. Here on one side if there are men of auspicious and modest nature and noble persons, then on the other side there are lions, serpents, scorpions etc., violent and poisonous living-creatures also. They are covering the society hidden here and there. Therefore, men of understanding should seek the company of noble persons escaping from wicked persons and their baseless censure. If in fact there are bad habits and vices in our character. We should make effort with indomitable will to remove them so that none may get any chance to condemn—</p>

<p class="Text">‘O the Lord! free me from vices!’</p>
<p class="Text">Give up the sensitive nature. If anyone opposes you without any reason, don’t pay any heed to his reproach. People always condemn the good, the persons eager to uplift, constantly go on progress and uplifting. They never care for the social critics and jealous persons. The great men have to make their way of progress through the adverse rivals and hard struggles. The people could not estimate them and remained opposing for the sake of opposition only. Ultimately they won completely. Form your habit to remain balanced even in the condition of bitter criticism, censure, bitter words and opposition. Tolerance is the divine quality of human being. Develop it. If anyone says ill, don’t take it ill. Make your nature tolerant. Keep in mind—</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-20">Free your mind from imaginary fears</p>
<p class="Text">You are worried uselessly with an imaginary fear hidden in your mind. The fear of death, the fear of abashment, the fear of attack by anyone, the fear of being oppressed by the enemies, the fear of the devils and ghosts in the night, the fear of the loss in the business, the fear of dismissal from service, the fear of deterioration in health, the fear of loafing of children or the fear of loss of accumulated capital—these or numerous fears like this usually disturb your mind day and night.  </p>
<p class="Text">Believe truly that most of such fears are only the creation of imagination point blank and they are never to cause you any harm. You have got them in vain secretly rooted in your mind being afraid of them in vain.</p>
<p class="Text">Ninety percent cowards are disturbed because of imaginary fears but practically they never happen visit in their real life. The practice of fear becomes their habit. In every condition and situation they find themselves afraid of. The long stay of fear in the mind, makes us coward and timid, The prowess of a coward is lost. </p>
<p class="Text">Such a man can never do any work of courage. The habit of his timidity makes him unsuccessful in every sphere of life. </p>
<p class="Text">The cowards always think—‘I am nothing. I am a mean. Any big work of importance is not possible to be done by me. I am helpless, mean and destitute. Others are superior to me in knowledge, talent, strength, capability, shrewdness and they are better than I, they are endowed with all the qualities.’ The feelings of inferiority are hurdles in the right development of a man. Due to the root of fear in the mind, man’s valuable inner plans are destroyed in the dust within a moment.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Fear is the indication of our ignorance</p>
<p class="Text">The tendency of fear is the enemy of human life. The life of cowards and timids is worthless. Cowards die thousand times in a day. Thousands of lives are being doomed due to useless imaginary fear and becoming the victim of untimely death. </p>
<p class="Text">Just as the stormy blow of wind and heavy rain shatter the delicate flowers, plants, charming buds by shaking off, similarly the ill imaginations of the demon of fear shatter and leave the delicate and immatured heart in the undeveloped form and timid forever by its black-like death shadow. </p>
<p class="Text">Fear is the symbol of our ignorance and lack of understanding. As the feeling of insecurity increases in human mind, so do the creative positive capacities go on being crippled. His real fearless personality of lion with strong manhood goes on setting in the darkness. These cowards and timids don’t have their fear, superistitions, sorrow, timidity, hesitation, shame and lack of confidence limited to themselves but spread their timid mentality among the neighbours of the vicinity, friends even into their own children. Our female class is badly entangled since the ages, with the mentality of fear and timidity. The Indian women specially uneducated living in the villages and backward women remain striken with fear and lead their whole life in the prison of fear. Due to their timidity they have to lead the life of a helpless slave. Timidity and fear is the mental disorder of man’s decaying moral strength.</p>

<p class="Sub-Heading">Slap the lion</p>
<p class="Text">The Portguese News agency, Lusitenia reported from Lisbon that a vigorous man imbedded his teeth into the nose of a lion in Angola with such courage that it had to run away abandoning the wounded person.</p>
<p class="Text">The occurence is reported that two brothers naming Lusio and Jokim Chanka went to the forest for hunting; where a lion sprang upon Lusio and having knocked him down on the earth gripped him under his claws. He fell into a great dangerous risk. The death was covering him with its black shadow every moment. The lion intended to kill him. His brother Jokim could not shoot the lion; because the gun was with the servant and he had fled away being frightened. To save his brother from the claws of the lion, Jokim fell out with the lion with force to knock him down; but when it went beyond his control like the violent beasts he imbedded his teeth in the nose of the lion so forcibly that its breath stopped. A portion of the neck was cut down also. The lion was perturbed. Just as the hold of the lion was a little loose, Lucio jumping stood up and he shot at the lion. Both of the brothers remained hospitalised for a month in the injured position in the Nampula hospital; but they were saved. Such lions of courage and prowess among mankind are the true jewels of humanity.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Killed the lion with the axe</p>
<p class="Text">In the village, Ekulgarh a bold and brave Harijan youth named Mehataba alone killed the lion with the axe. It so happened that the lion had taken away the goat from his house in the night. He got furiated on this and his strong arms were thrilled to take revenge. In the morning he set out from the house in search of the lion. Wandering about he remained searching for the lion for a number of hours. At last, on the side of a river in a ditch he searched out the lion. The duel was fought between the lion and Mehtab. The lion gripped Mehtab’s hands twice in his jaws; but ultimately Mehtab killed the lion with the blows of his axe. </p>
<p class="Text">Even the insufficient means in the hands of courageous persons show their worth. A hero gets victory so many times with his more long bamboo-stick but a coward cannot in spite of being equipped with cannon and dagger. None but a brave deserves the enjoyment of the earth. Here, there are numerous heros, one better than other and you are one of them.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">By strangling the neck killed the Tiger</p>
<p class="Text">A youth named Bhagirath belonging to the village, Khogasara, district Bilaspur, strangled the neck of a seven feet long tiger and killed it. At a place, a snake and a tiger were struggling neck to neck, where many villagers gathered to watch it. What inspired the tiger and it stopped fighting with the snake abruptly and it fell upon the crowd. All the villagers ran away being frightened. Bhagirath faced bravo in the struggle, Bhagirath caught the neck of the tiger tightly and pressed it so tightly with the best possible force that it died. This is the inspiring story of the man of prowess. In fact, the world has been bowing down before the power. In the world none but the braves are adored. The majesties kiss those who have strength and capability in their arms. </p>
<p class="Text">The above mentioned examples are of those who are also the men of flesh and blood like us. They had also the same body like us; they had also the same legs and hands like us. The difference was only that they had the brave passion of prowess, courage and zeal, the inner moral strength, They had full self-confidences. That is why they could take the courageous step.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The villagers killed the Lion</p>
<p class="Text">The news report of Tehsil Faridpur of Bareilly has been published as follows—</p>
<p class="Text">The residents of village Charhia Tahsil Faridpur killed one eight and half feet long lion with Lathi and Danda (long bamboo stick). It is reported that a man named Dula Singh was grazing his camel in the neighbouring forest. A lion fell upon him in the meantime hearing the noise, the farmers working in the neighbouring fields reached there with lathi and spike and released Dula Singh from the clutch of the lion anyhow. One of the villagers brought a licenced gun from his house and he shot at the wounded lion which died immediately.</p>
<p class="Text">It has been the tradition of the holy soil of India giving birth to such heroes. We are braves. The castes make progress ahead on the basis of courage. It is only the courage that makes the counrties developed. The courageous move ahead and the circumstances also favour them, the companions also help them but those who lack of self-confidence, who have not realised their vigour, remain in a fix about their strength and remain thinking in fear that they are incompetent to do anything. Failure greets them who are devoid of self-confidence.</p>
<p class="Text">Different news of valour and prowess usually cover the newspapers today, which are the signs of growing prowess in the country. Peruse a few news events—</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Reward to brave villagers of Banda</p>
<p class="Text">As it is said that three villagers of Banda, Devasaran, Chunni Lal and Narbada had compelled an armed gang of robbers to run away from the village Khohi by hitting them with bricks and stones and had made their plan of robbery futile. The S.P. of Banda namely Shri A.M. Shah had rewarded them for their courage and bravery. The villagers had faced the robbers very boldly and had wounded one of the robbers badly who had been carried away by his companions.</p>
<p class="Text">This is the psychological truth that energy of a man lies inside the man and not so much externally Vitality appears outwardly, but basically it is hidden inside. He who looks fat, well built, strong and heavy physically cannot face the storm and wind and falls down being rooted out like the hollow tree if he is weak by mind, courage and prowess and if the circumstances don’t favour he will never be in position to rise.</p>
<p class="Text">But the man who is mentaly strong in his thoughts and feelings who has the treasure of confidence and courage, will never feel any problem in facing the adverse situations. The mental courage, prowess and valour is strong like the splendour of the sun which gives the acquaintance of its presence even tearing off the clouds. No other support or means of the world can equal to the courage ensuing from self-confidence of the world.</p>
<p class="Text">We need the capital of courage at every step in our daily life. Even today there are many such courageous men who are setting the examples of valour and prowess.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The old man’s jump with indomitable courage</p>
<p class="Text">According to the news received from Varahava (Santhal Paragana), in the recent past, a thief was caught in the 131 U.P. Sealdah-Gaya passanger train by the indomitable courage of an old man.</p>
<p class="Text">As it is said that as soon as the train arrived near the local station, a band of thieves threw out the box of the 55 years old man, and they themselves also jumped down from the compartment. The passanger also jumped down after the thieves. Then, the thieves began to assault him, but hearing his cry the police constables rounding on duty, rushed there and arrested the thieves.</p>
<p class="Text">This old man had the moral strength. The support of the Lord always follows the noble and right men.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The villagers knocked down the two robbers</p>
<p class="Text">One day, in the village Amba under Chhurpur police station of the district Prayag, two robbers were killed in the encounter between a few villagers and the gang of robbers. Three to four villagers are also reported to be injured with the bullets in the firing. In the report it has been published that a dozen of robbers well equipped with arms and violent weapons launched a raid in a house of the village. Hearing the loud roar and cry, the villagers gathered there with lathis and spears. The robbers started firing on them but the villagers were not afraid but they were successful in killing the two robbers. The rest dacoits ran away.</p>
<p class="Text">On the support of courage people protect their life and property, morality and family. By this courage, protection is possible everywhere. A courageous man takes its advantage every moment. It is not known where and how there may be the need of courageous performance. So, it is needed to remain strong in all the circumstances. The cowards suffering from inferiority complex are always suspicious. They remain in a fix whether they are capable to protect themselves or not.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Wonderful courage of the youth</p>
<p class="Text">There is a news of Bhardah (Ghazipur) that in the neighbouring village, Mirzapur, when a youth had bent down to detach the bullock from the peg, a very big poisonous snake fell down from the thatch of the hut on his back and it tightened the neck of the youth with its tail. This youth was not the least frightened. He showed an uncommon courage. In the middle of his both legs approaching his hands he caught the hood of the snake and twisted his fist tightly. On one side the snake was tightening the youth’s neck with a great force and on the other hand the youth was going on tightenning his fist. In the meantime the family members and the neigbourers got the youth’s neck freed from the hold of the snake’s tail and the youth threw away the snake with a jerk. The back bone of the snake broke away and the people killed it.</p>
<p class="Text">When the men of courage proceed onward the circumstances also support them and so many courageous helpers come forward in support. Courage breeds courage. One’s boldness encourages the otherone’s boldness. But those who lack self-confidence, who have never realized their own immense capacity, live in the darkness of suspicion and fearing and shivering remain thinking  that they are at all incapable to do anything. They never start any new big work. Such fearing cowards are always unsuccessful in life. They who suffer from inferiority complex get only failures in their lives. ‘None but the heros of mind taste and enjoy the fruit of wealth, health, position, power, rule, weapons co-operation etc.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-22">You are hero, so don’t be afraid of the enemies</p>
<p class="Text">The more you have fear, the more you are threatened, frightened, censured and slandered. The world always valuates your strength and prowess. If it is found that you are caving in, then, the people serve their self-interest by curbing, coercing and frightening you more and more.</p>
<p class="Text">If you under-estimate yourself, you will grow weaker, devoid of influence, more impotent and more afraid. Your vigour, prowess, willfulness and resolve will be deteriorating day by day. The imaginary fear will push you down into the hell of downfall. If you step back being afraid of your enemies, you will inspire and strengthen them to be more active against you. Your own errors and short comings will be bent upon in standing against you. </p>
<p class="Text">The enemy-fear is a false thinking of an imaginary mind. Being overpowered by it merely, we form the false imagination of our inferiority complex and meekness in the delusion of mind we overestimate our hostile. This false fear of mind has converted most of hearts into the funeral ground.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">In reality you are valorous</p>
<p class="Text">Believe in my words, you are a valorous one. The  capability of the protection of the nation runs through your veins.</p>
<p class="Text">I know several such men kind who have fallen down into the miserable condition having been entangled into the clutches of their fancied enemies and have reached this miserable condition. Their mind is filled with the imaginary fear. Such men always dream of the coming miseries and various devastating adversities. So throughout their life being under the spell of the imaginary fearful tendency they have shattered their courageous efforts and ambitions.</p>
<p class="Text">This fear is our terrible enemy to arouse the feeling of weakness in our life. This fear is the sole creator of disbelief, laziness, impatience, boldlessness, dissatisfaction, weakness and such type of different weaknesses of mind. After casting off the imagination from our mind, the noble qualities of man begin to develop.</p>
<p class="Text">There are a number of persons who are desirous to know other’s opinion about themselves. He always thinks about the opinion of some man or what does the newspaper speak of him? What is the attitude and opinion of anyone about my caste, race, country and religion? What is the reaction of the public about me? When I cross through the market what they talk about me?</p>
<p class="Text">When a man is involved in such types of logical or illogical arguements, it should be concluded that the man has been caught into the net of imaginary fear. In his secret mind, any weak mentality of his childhood is hidden anywhere and he is glancing the shadow of their pictures here and there.</p>
<p class="Text">As to see the faults in others is considered to be the mental blemish, similarly to suffer from inferiority complex and find fault and weaknesses in our ownself again and again is also to make the man weak and inferior.</p>
<p class="Text">It is mentioned in the Bible at a place that the object which a man has in abundance that very object  will be given more to him. That what is lacking that lesser object or virtue will also be snatched from him. </p>
<p class="Text">In other words it means that if your weakness is more dominant then the weakness, poverty, inferiority, sorrow, wretchedness, shortcoming, defeat will be available to you in abundence. If you think of your weaknesses, the same poisonous and foul atmosphere will continue to be created in your hidden mind. Even in your surrounding atmosphere, the weakness will remain spreading. You will be afraid of even the triffling matters. You will go on fearing of the nightmares the whole night.</p>
<p class="Text">Contrary to it, if you are overwhelmed with vigour, courage, gallantry enthusiasm, exhilaration and auspicious thoughts, the sentiment of courage and gallantry will be originated in your mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Your fears are imaginary. Your worries are your self-creation. In your full natural form, you are perfectly fearless, fear from worldly sorrows, miseries and all sorts of worries. Your real form is the form of hero. Any kind of cowardice thought should not come to your temple of mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Your inner-sense is such a mirror where you can see your fearless form. By rubbing that mirror with the sand of courage and self-confidence make it dignified. </p>
<p class="Text">If you may be capable to be free from fear in your life, you can be able to open the new chapter of your life. Only then, you can attain the life of prowess and victory. </p>
<p class="Text">The irrefutable principle of science is that two contradictory thoughts cannot be possible at a single place. When you fill your secret mind with the courageous thoughts in abundance, there will be no question of failure or defeat then at all.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-23">The neat and clean garments have their spiritual impact</p>
<p class="Text">As we feel a type of freshness after a bath by the openning of the hair-roots of our body and the rubbing of the body, similarily the man’s spirit gets pleasure after putting on new and neat and clean garments.</p>
<p class="Text">The character of our soul is cleanliness. This is free from all kinds of vices, defilements, filthy objects. Dirt cannot stay there in it. There cannot be even the drizzle of the mud of sin. If any object makes effort to make it muddy, there arises the cry of self-reproach, repentence and remorse. When any evil thought, unholy wicked fancy, despicable sensuousness and the mean mentality inferior to our morality, disturbs our truth, love, duty and devotion entering the sphere of our mind, all of us feel an internal percussion in our soul. What is the reason behind it? </p>
<p class="Text">Our spirit can never support us to do any such immoral deed which is associated with any kind of physical, oral, mental dirt. The men of dirty presumptions or nasty action resort to vile actions having ignored the inner voice; but internally they remain afflicted by a mental agony. You may suppress this inner voice for a certain period but its pious action goes on continuously.</p>
<p class="Text">The duty of inner voice is—To perform the act of cleanliness in our innerself; To initiate the mankind on the path of truth with the discernment between right and wrong removing all the dirty thoughts, counsels or fancies whatsoever come to our mind. The man who hears the innervoice is always guided to the right path by the inner voice. The sphere of his mind is always clean. Wherever any dirty thought is created in our mind like a rebel, the very moment the auspicious instincts of our mind turn it out by struggling with them.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Our outer atmosphere should be perfectly neat and clean</p>
<p class="Text">Since, cleanliness is the innate quality of our soul, so outer cleanliness also gives us full satisfaction and pleasure. The clean atmosphere has its impact on our health, pleasure, internal joy.</p>
<p class="Text">The garments of man play a very important role in the creation of neat and clean atmosphere. The garments are in the close contact of our body. It affects our internal instincts in its creation. The internal tendencies are created by the influence of our garments. If our garments are clean, naturally, the series of pure thoughts start. The flow of thought itself goes towards the purity and virtuousness. Our thoughts are unable to rise up so high due to dirtiness. Their moral truth is hurt unexpected. Because of living continuously in the contact of dirty garments our high spirits become crippled slowly and slowly.</p>
<p class="Text">It was the belief of Mahatma Gandhi that only in the clean Khadi garments he used to be inspired by the pure thoughts of truth, justice, non-violence and the world-brotherhood. Every non-violent truthful freedom fighter should wear khadi garments. There is a close contact between the Khadi garments and the purity of thoughts.</p>
<p class="Text">Cleanliness in the atmosphere and the cleanliness of the garments generate the clean mind. The men who is habitual of cleanliness is always higher in the standard of his thoughts than those in dirty garments.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Cleanliness is next Godliness’—this proverb has a great message. Cleanliness makes our approach near divinity. The special quality of the gods is their cleanliness. By living neat and clean you make your reach near divinity.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">What a matter of sorrow it is that whereas the other castes and races are always active for cleanliness and sow the seed of cleanliness among their children, here in our country a very little attention is being paid towards it. Cleanliness is a habit. If once it becomes our habit, it will continue lifelong and man will not forget it the whole life. It should be kept in mind that there is a big difference between cleanliness and fashion. Fashion is to show others and cleanliness is to root out dirtiness. Fashion in itself is only the indication of dirty mind.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-24">Feel self-esteemed of adopting Hindu dress and Hindi language</p>
<p class="Text">An English writer Tomas Fuler has written—with that simplicity of dress is the sign of gentility. Our spiritual feelings remain alive. The dress of a man reveals his religion, caste, country and culture everything for the man of clean and sober dress. Doors of all the high societies remain open, while the valuable glittering fashionable dresses indicate the shallowness of the personality and we become the victim of hatred in the others eyes due to pomp and show and spuriousness. For the improvement of virtues and character your garments are also required to be like that of the civilized persons.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The Hindu Get up is the only comfortable and simple</p>
<p class="Text">Every caste and every country man boasts of the make up of his caste or country superior but the entire world knows this fact and accepts the reality that Indian get up is attractive. The Dhoti Kurta and the Jaket the get up of Indian Hindu males and the Saree in practice among the Hindu women is considered to be the best and comfortable in the whole world. The countries of the world wherever our late Prime-minister, Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri visited in Dhoti and Kurta his dress had been considered the best and highly appreciated. In the same way Pandit Vijaya Lakshmi’s and Smt. Indira Gandhi’s Indian Sarees have been given the foremost place in cleanliness, attraction and modesty.</p>
<p class="Text">The garments are closely related to our culture and religion. To distinguish every culture and religion is the separate make up also. The get up of a particular type creates a particular type of mentality and feeling in the mind. Even uneducated illiterate man are seen in the Western style in coat pant and tie and in hat  boot and socks blindly following the western style. By smattering of English they complete their hypocrisy. The shallow mentality of vanity, obstinacy, false dignity, luxury and bragging begin to be created in the mind just while putting on the English dress. The prosperity, lewdness of sensuous enjoyment, luxury, glamorous show is attached to the Muslim dresses. With the dress get up and language, the culture, history and religion are attached. The Western and Muslim culture and religion are based on the lewdness of sexual passion and on the voluptuousness of eat, drink and be merry. They give more importance to the lewdness and meaningless worldly objects. At the same time there is the excess of repulsive and disgusting vulgarity, nakedness and lewdness all around there. In the Western society everywhere there is the dominance of voluptuous brutal mentality. These countries give priorty only to the artificial outer beauty (should it be called the real beauty?), pomp and show and false show. Daily the new fashions are introduced there. Among these castes the unsatisfied desires of sexual passion and different enjoyments and sensuous life are the hindrance in the rise of their thoughts and talent above the materialistic level. They have forgotten the value of high ideals of life in remaining absorbed in taking the beastly taste of meat, wine, mean objects and lower ideals. Whatever the dresses and get up, pomp and show, the fondness of fashion, false boasting, outer decoration, sensuousness and enjoyments of Western and Muslim cultures are; that is the brutish pleasure of man’s five sense organs.</p>
<p class="Text">Put on the muslims or Western dresses for a single day, you will feel the same thoughts like them in your mind. You are in an army uniform, your mind is filled with the sentiments of violence, brutals, terror wickedness and to oppress on others and ostentation. In the muslim dress, the sentiments of sensuousness, passion and selfishness, demonstration and shallowness are created in the mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Today the Indian youths who are running after fashion, wearing the half naked and tight dresses like the film actors acting in the vulgar films, wander about on the roads at the city, loafing about with transistor in their hands and remain gathered in group on the cigarette and betel shops, before the hotels and cinema halls, only make the demonstration of fashion. In such a blind copy what is beauty? Such a modernism is merely an illusion. </p>
<p class="Text">The Indian dresses, neat and clean while Dhoti, loose and long Kurta, jacket, sandle etc., are proper and comfortable, cheap and according to the economic status and season. They create the atmosphere of co-ordialily and compassion. There is more cleanliness, attraction and comforts in these dresses; man is free from meaningless show also. Fraternity, simplicity, humbleness, modesty and gentility have been the distinctive characteristics of our culture and religion. By the use of this dress our spiritual feelings remain alive. We consider the excess make up and showy robes ostentatious. This pomp and show has been considered here baseful. By using the minimum possible robes to establish identification with nature to have our body away from decoration and make up, fashion, pomp and show, simple living and high thinking has been the view of our life and it should continue in future also.</p>
<p class="Text">In the Western countries where the sentiment to win the nature prevails, the Indian culture and Hindu religion has made a humble effort to establish identification with nature. In the Hindu religion the mountains like the Himalaya, the Kailash, the rivers like the Ganga, the Yamuna and the Godawari, forests, trees and gardens have been considered sacred. They have been considered the dwelling places of the Lord, Not only the saints and hermits of India but also the public of India have been enjoying the pleasure in the laps of Nature. The Indian Hindus consider the nature as their mother instead of treating the nature as maidservant and they give due regard to the nature. They have always realised and felt oneness with the forests, creepers, mountains, rivers, animals, birds and trees of Nature. Our pilgrimages and temples have been established near the rivers and mountains. The forests, gardens and villages have been the good symbols of our culture.</p>
<p class="Text">So, due to the village-dresses and affinity with nature, the simplicity, cleanliness, health, modesty and liberality are found in our dresses also. The mentality of looking always embelished is considered to be the sign of shallowness. The worthless artificiality, and decorating objects of different colours have been always the objects of detachment for us here. According to the Indian culture this has been the concept that as much artificiality and show is adopted in life and as much unnaturality is there in our dresses, so much distance will continue to be created from higher life.</p>
<p class="Text">Indian dresses don’t mean poverty or helplessness rather it means to use the suitable and necessary objects sacredly without any show. This simplicity, cleanliness, pridelessness should be associated with our behaviour and conduct. The robes should not be very costly and injurious to health like Nylon, Terelyn and it should not be of very thin threads of silk. It is not needed at all. We have been the lover of thick white ‘Khaddar’; but it should be clean. The dresses of glamorous show, different colours and unnatural fashionable, are the symbol of worthless hollowness. The quantity of the dresses should be minimum for wearing but we should have the full consideration of its cleanliness. This is the sanctity of Indian thoughts that instead of being loaded with ornaments better to get some new dresses made and in maintaining cleanliness to spend some money is more useful. The simplicity of mind, thought, dress and the cleanliness of the surrounding atmosphere and soberity have the wonderful capacity to attract towards the high spiritual life.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The Hindu religion and culture is attached with Hindi literature and Hindi language</p>
<p class="Text">The slavery of language is the worst; because with the language the culture and religion of that country is also to be adopted secretly. We begin to accept the religion, traditions, the braves and culture of that country also which national language we love, adopt or fully appreciate. Behind the curtain of the language the religion and culture are also preached. Behind every word, idiom and proverb of the language, the religion, culture and sacrament are hidden and they also speak. The religion comes out in day-to-day behaviour in the garb of language. The formation of numerous words is made through the source of religion. The religion and language are co-related.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The diplomacy of Britishers; the slavery of Englishmen</p>
<p class="Text">When the Englishmen had won India, they were not satisfied merely with the victory over trade and business and political victory. The political slavery is the outer and external administrative slavery. The rule is administered on the base of administrative punishment, terror and fear. They planned to enslave Hindustan (the Hindus country) with the view of mental slavery also.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">How was this mental slavery created?</p>
<p class="Text">When any brave race wins over the weak race, she tries to make her slave in all respects. The winner race thursts upon her the load of her language and literature. They have to study the language and literature of the winner race forcibly. Those who learn that language are rewarded and the appreciation certificates are distributed to them. The defeated race learns the appreciation and praise of the heros of the winner race directly or indirectly again and again; sees their pictures, sings their songs and lives in the atmosphere of their mentality. So, silently, the defeated race goes on accepting also the religion of the winner race and adopts her traditional customs and ideals also. </p>
<p class="Text">The bad result of the physical weakness and defeat is that they begin to consider the winner race superior to them in all respects. It develops the feeling of mental and cultural slavery in the loser caste. By reading the appreciation and praise of the other caste in their language and literature again and again, the people of weaker caste starts suffering from the inferiority complex and it seems to them that the rulers are superior to them in all respects and they are inferior and their everything is useless. This is the slavery of language.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, by the study of foreign language for a long time the defeated men begin to consider the foreigners superior and consider their literature, culture, ideals, customs and traditions and their thoughts superior most. They regard their old fables and stories and their racial ideals the best one. This is the rule of the psychology that we begin to think it true (even if it may be wrong and baseless) whatever is mentioned before us again and again. Thus, by the study of a foreign language and literature for a long time, any caste or race forgets her own racial dignity and the golden glory of her cultural heritage. Thus, the mental slavery goes on increasing.</p>
<p class="Text">Our mental slavery in India has been continuing since long through the foreign language and literature. Behind the curtain of the language religion is also preached. It is a matter of great shock that none has yet paid attention to this minute psychological fact of preaching the other religion secretly behind the curtain of language.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The slavery of Urdu and Islam</p>
<p class="Text">The mental slavery in India started from Urdu and Islam religion. When the Muslims won India because of the rift among the Hindus, they had also preached Islam in this Hindu country through the Urdu language. There was the spread of Urdu and Persian reign. These languages were declared the national languages. The Hindu public were pressurised to read Urdu by terror and violence. Those who did not study Urdu, were not encouraged in the Govt jobs as well as in the state. On the other side, those Hindus who earned the knowledge of Urdu and Farasi due to fear or greed, were given superior jobs from the Gvernment. side as encouragement, sufficient rewards, honour and social status were awarded to them. </p>
<p class="Text">Behind the curtain of Urdu and Farasi the Islam was spread over. Secretly, many of Hindus were made muslim by converting their religion. The ideals of muslims and Islamic culture were advertised excessively. The big volums of Urdu were written and made popular. This was all the preaching of muslim life-style, rules of Islam, ideals of appearance and dresses, principles and doctorines abruptly the Islam took a turn.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The slavery of Englishmen and English language</p>
<p class="Text">The time changed. This time another foreign race suppressed us. There came an other big storm in the language, culture, dresses and ideals again. </p>
<p class="Text">Just when the age of Urdu, Farasi and Islam religious ended, the new age of English language and literature started. The Christian priests started the preaching of Christianity through the English language and literature. Lord Mackaly took the greatest interest in the conversing of English. First, by teaching English the clerks were prepared, they were given the good jobs and by awarding rewards and social status, the English was given the social sanctity and thus, a majority became well educated in English, it was made the state language then.</p>
<p class="Text">By getting the support of the Government, the reign of English was established in India. We began to imitate Englishmen, we began to put on English dress and began to feel proud of speaking in English.</p>
<p class="Text">In the primary classes, English was started to be taught from class three and in English medium schools English was started to be taught to the children. In the shadow of English, Hindu children were taught and preached the christianity; English culture, their gods, their way of living, their ideals and life system secretly. Many of Hindus, specially the men of untouchable class adopted Christianity. A number of missionary schools were started for the children. There was the priority to the teachings of Christianity more than imparting them education. The attractive publication of the ‘Bible’ were distributed among the children free of cost and in many institutions the ‘Bible’ was taught in the lower and higher classes to initiate them with the primary sacraments of Christian religion. By and by the Indians began to consider English the most superior language of the world. Thus, the slavery of English language covered the whole India due to some extent in the greed of the Government. services, to some extent due to fashion and the mentality of imitation. The natural attraction is created towards the foreign goods howsoever of inferior quality they may be. The attraction increased towards Englishmen. The English way of living, the English fashions and get up and English speaking had a great impact on the uneducated public of India and it went on continuing.</p>
<p class="Text">Contrary to it due to the spell of English, the minds of Indians began to suffer from the inferiority complex towards their literature, Hindu culture, Vedic religion, Indian dresses and culture. </p>
<p class="Text">To conclude, with the language, literature, dress of any country, the religion, culture and racial ideals of that country are closely connected. These sacraments are very easily rooted in the minds of the tender-hearted children. When our children study English language and literature, the feelings of the superiority of English men influence their minds. We became fan of Christian religion, their gods and goddess, materialism, perversity, their customs and traditions and voluptuousness and lust of sexuality. In English we read heroic tales of Christian braves. By reading it again and again, we become the inhabitant of their mental atmosphere. Their ideals and thoughts look us better and superior. Their religion and culture seem to us superior to Hindu religion and Indian culture. We read about the wars which they had won. Thus, the sentiments of the foreigners prowess, superiority and heroic feelings leave their strong impression on our hidden mind and thus, a type of mental slavery overpowers us. This mental slavery is prevailing today in this Hindu country. This slough must be given up without any delay.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">It is only Hindi and Sanskrit that can protect our religion</p>
<p class="Text"> With Hindi and Sanskrit languages, the Hindu religion and Indian culture and the old ideal sacraments and purifications are related. Sanskrit represents our glorious and praiseworthy traditions. Sanskrit is full of the best literature, spiritual knowledge and the property of original thoughts. Sanskrit is the source of all the languages of the world. The highness of spiritualism, philosophy and psychology lies in abundance therein our religious books which are in Sanskrit language. In philosophy no country of the whole world has yet been able to touch the height of India. The admirable and permanent property of spiritual knowledge what the Hindus possess; the vigorous fables of our braves, and the highest sacraments of Hindu caste are collected and safe in Hindi and Sanskrit.</p>
<p class="Text">For the protection of Hindu religion, Hindu culture, Indian ethics and thoughts, spiritualism etc., the advertisements and preaching of Hindi and Sanskrit at broad level is a great necessity for this country of Hindus. </p>
<p class="Text">To study Sanskrit and Hindi is the impartible part of our religion. Who is a Hindu who does not know these languages? Hindi can unite the whole nation by creating the emotional unity in the country. This is the moral duty of the scholars of Hindi and Sanskrit that they should work for the development and preaching of the both languages and make effort so that the property of the old thoughts  the both languages are under the reach of common public. The doubts of the public mind should be dispelled that there is lack of other literature useful to mankind in Sanskrit literature except only the Vedas, Shastras and grammer. There is the invaluable property of literary and philosophical thoughts in the Sanskrit Literature. The language that remains as much as popular to the common people so much developed and long lived it becomes. Contrary to it, if it is unpopular from the common public, it becomes the object of long past untimely. By chance, Sanskrit has met some unfortunate fate. It is a matter of great sorrow that in spite of being the richest literature of the world, it has been considered the dead literature of the past, but now, the interest towards the study of Sanskrit has started growing among the people for sometimes. This is a good symptom, but there is the need of the support and co-operation of Hindi for the protection of this growing interest and development. The entire Sanskrit literature should be spread in every corner of the country through the medium of Hindi. They, who know Hindi and Sanskrit and the learned men, should do much hard labour for the protection and encouragement of this growing interest and development, only then this interest can be lasting and useful.</p>
<p class="Text">The ancient glory of India, Hindu religion and Indian culture have faced a great loss by the compulsory teaching and learning of English in the bitter days of the slavery of British rule. Having forgotten the praiseworthy traditions of Hindus, we have began to copy the Western dress, language and materialistic views. For the cultural awakenning and to create the emotional unity, it is a great need of the time to adopt Hindi by the majority of the people.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Let us not follow the Western way of life and their ideology blindly</p>
<p class="Text">We should do the best possible to regain the ancient glory of our country, religion, language and culture. Let us live in the simplicity of our country. No country becomes great by the blind following of others. We should develop our own characteristics. By own mother language, culture and dress only the development of the country is possible. George Bernard Shaw has truly said—‘Such a man who has no control on his own language, can never be expert in other language!</p>
<p class="Text">Hindi language is in the practice of forty-three percent people of India. This is the main language of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The Hindu religion, Indian culture and the ages old purest sacraments are hidden behind it. Because of the origin of this language from Sanskrit, it is close to Bengali and Marathi.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">So, every Hindu should feel self-esteemed of adopting Hindi language and Hindu dress. By the propagation of these elements, the Hindu religion can spread extensively and the emotional unity can be established. The spread of Hindi means the spread of Hinduism. All the ideal high sanctities of Hindu religion, the traditional ideals, ambitions, the leading thoughts, the ancient glory and the future progress is vested in making this language popular more and more. Considering his moral duty every Hindu should study the religious literatures published in Hindi, establish the library of religious books in the family and donate in charity the Hindi religious literature having purchased it.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-25">In the time of crisis, hope should not be given up</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Necessity of the inner strength not of the external one</p>
<p class="Text">The writer named Mark Ruderford has mentioned an accident in his autobiography. It was his childhood. Once, Mark Ruderford was standing on a sea beach. Afar a ship was berthed having cast an anchor. The child Ruderford wished to take a round of the ship by swimming and come back. He was very expert in swimming and he had the practice of taking out the stone from the bottom by taking the dip of ten feet down the depth. He was a young boy. The ship was berthed at the distance of two hundred yards from the beach.</p>
<p class="Text">He swam and reached the ship easily but as soon as he began to return, it may be his ill luck or ill of mind, the foolish, hopeless and coward thought came to his mind that his decision of ‘return’ was beyond his power and he would die before reaching the sea-shore. He does not have so much strength in him that he will be able to reach there safely again wherefrom he had come. In his odd imagination he presumed that he would die. He thought himself sunk before drowning. He began to count the last days of his death. He lost his strength. </p>
<p class="Text">But his mind changed again. From the horizon of darkness the dim rays of hope rose.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, he thought ‘Death is sure the danger is terrible, the shore looks dim, why not to struggle once more before drowning?’ He also said to himself—‘Till today, it is clear in my mind that this will be last struggle for me before my watery-grave—‘A heroic effort’—and I strengthened my broken hope and with a new zeal, I made effort again  with full capacity. I am unable to describe what way I chose in my effort (it is not known, how the God had provided me that courage). I used my will power with my full capacity to win over fear.</p>
<p class="Text">In a single moment the fear came to an end and my mind was fully confident that I could save my life. The hidden power of the God is in my support. I know to swim. If I have come here by swimming, then, I can return also. Patience overtook my mind. I started using my hands comfortably and in a very short time crossing the sea I reached the shore. From the innerself the divine force saved me. </p>
<p class="Text">To mention here this fearful event is important because it proves that the man losing the patience, should never think that whatever he did that was final and to the best of his capacity and he could do no more. This is also worth noting that I faced this terrible situation by abruptly created self-confidence in the mind and made the best effort. It had made my victory ten times easier.</p>
<p class="Text">In reality, the God is present in our innerself to provide us the strength of courage at the moment of crisis. From the inner side He supports us to get salvation.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">We get the inner support of the Lord</p>
<p class="Text">Let us take the support of patience and courage at the time of hardships, think of the prowess and make the best possible efforts to fight the difficulties and beat them; have confidence of our divine powers and we can overcome the hardships without any loss.</p>
<p class="Text">The hair of the body may be tiny but actually it is well deep rooted. In the same way, man’s roots of courage are deeply rooted in his confidence. This vigour and prowess is present inside us.</p>
<p class="Text">The man who looks physically strong from the outside but inwardly he is weak, will fall down being rooted out like a hollow tree before any storm and if the circumstances did not favour, he will never rise up. But the man who is emotionally stong; and has the capital of courage with him; will never feel any problem in struggling against the reverse circumstances.</p>
<p class="Text">The inner force (spiritual power) is like the pungent splendour of the sun, which makes to realize its existence even tearing the dense clouds. No help, facility or support of the world can equal the support of self-confidence.</p>
<p class="Text">They who expect sympathy from others by showing their meekness and weakness are in delusion.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Difficulties are a must for the evolution of life</p>
<p class="Text">The English learned man named Carlyle has written the matter of great experience of which each and every word is the source of new inspiration—</p>
<p class="Text">The difficulties don’t deserve hostility but fraternity. They should be considered necessary for the school of life. By clashing with the difficulties man becomes strong. While teaching the skill of wrestling in the wrestling arena, the master makes his pupil fall down by knocking down him again and again. He is hurt, he is sprained, he gets jolts, he is soaked with dust and sweat, he feels terribly tired but the same labour makes a man strong. He becomes energetic. The each and every part of his body becomes strong.</p>
<p class="Text">In the same way, if the difficulties don’t occur in our life, if we don’t face the hardships of life, if we don’t clash with miseries, the life will become utterly inactive and empty of zeal. So, to build up the life the difficulties should be greeted for the progress of life considering them the necessary means. Let us be ready to accept their challenge and remain removing even one misery by suffering one hundred pains. This is called prowess, humanity and this is the only way of progress and success.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-26">Invaluable Treasures of Experience</p>
<p class="Text">Righteousness is the friend and guide of our daily life; this is the life style of daily and every moment behaviour in practice. In the life of many great men the morality has saved them from the mud of sin. Some examples are given here—</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">God is the seer of everything</p>
<p class="Text">A justice named Changsen lived there in Mongolia. He was highly religious-minded. He used to practise righteousness in his day-to-day behaviour. Due to this reason he had to pass his life sometimes in scarcity.</p>
<p class="Text">It so happened one day—</p>
<p class="Text">One day, his certain rich friend came to him. After the usual talks of formality, he took out a packet of golden coins and presenting it to him with due regard he said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Nobody will be able to know the secret of this money except you and me. Please, accept this packet and let my work be done. Well! Who witnesses it? None will discuss about this money and your dignified reputation will also not be hurt. Be carefree from this secret matter. This fact will not be leaked out by me at all.’</p>
<p class="Text">The greed of money deviates even the men of great reputation from the path of morality. Who sacrifices the offered money and specially, when it has been offered by any reliable man?</p>
<p class="Text">That gentleman was confident that the bribe would be accepted and his immoral work would be done silently.</p>
<p class="Text">But the morality of the justice raised its voice. He was in favour of always to practise the morality in day- to-day behaviour. His inner soul gave him the moral support and he said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Friend! Don’t say that none is the witness of this immoral money. Morality is a necessary part of human nature. By the secret moral wisdom of man gets the  inner gratification and mental peace. We should criticise ourselves also with the same bitter point of view as we criticise others. There are no eyes of flesh to witness this immoral money undoubtedly, but the house and the earth are the witness. Hundreds of eyes of the sky are the witness of our secret deeds and the Lord of all having numberless eyes that Supreme Almighty is the witness of all our outer and internal deeds of every moment. I will not accept this immoral money at all. I will give the decision in your case according to my moral prudence.’ </p>
<p class="Text">The judge did not accept the immoral money. The morality was winner.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">I will not defy the moral prudence</p>
<p class="Text">This is an event of 1915—</p>
<p class="Text">Lokmanya Tilak thought to go abroad. There were already the obstacles regarding money and transportation but another unexpected problem came before him.</p>
<p class="Text">It was so as the then orthodox tradition against the sea-voyage stood as a hurdle on his way. Those days, the sea voyage was considered against religion. They who went on the journey abroad with strong will used to be outcasted. Thus, none could think of the abroad-journey. </p>
<p class="Text">Tilak thought, ‘For the progress and uplift of the country, the visit of the foreign countries should be made to know the secret of their progress. If the permission is granted by the old Pandits for the visit of the foreign countries, the moral hurdle will be over. </p>
<p class="Text">With this consideration Mahamanya Tilak reached Kashi and there he requested a Mahamahopadhyay ‘It will be much better if he certifies that with my sea-voyage there would be no harm to religion.’</p>
<p class="Text">Panditji heard the request of Tilak. He considered it a good opportunity. It is a good chance to charge money from Tilak. He had been serving his purpose of self-interest behind the curtain of religion some times in the past also. Now again, the greed of money flashed before his eyes. Giving the solution of the problems he said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘This journey is against the ethics of religion. In general condition we don’t allow anybody; but if you can spend rupees five thousand as atonement, you may be permitted to visit abroad under the religious sanctity. Tell me, can you manage this amount?’</p>
<p class="Text">Tilak was adamant to go abroad on any condition. He could manage this amount very easily. His economic condition was also better. Having managed the money when he thought to give the money, suddenly his innerself jolted him and the inner voice shook him off —</p>
<p class="Text">‘Religion is the ordain of God. Morality is the strong base of our society. If the moral wisdom is disregarded in this way, the moral system of the society will be shattered badly. I should not do this immoral act in my self-interest.</p>
<p class="Text">His unconscious mind began to curse him again and again for doing this act against the moral wisdom. His moral consciousness began to reproach him for changing the religion in his favour with the support of money. He began to feel his act improper. His innerself began to imprecate him for his conduct against morality. He could not pacify his moral wisdom. </p>
<p class="Text">At last, he decided—‘I will not allow immorality and self interest to dominate myself. I will not allow morality to be stigmatised by money. He turned back with the money. He did not defy the morality and he felt a great peace in his hidden mind.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The service of humanity is the best religion</p>
<p class="Text">‘Swami Ram Krishna Math’ had already been established in Calcutta. All of his devotees had already taken the enterance in the ‘Mutth’ having taken renunciation. The financial expenses of the ‘Mutth’ were met by the profit of the land attached to the ‘Mutth’. The hermits had no other work except devotional muttering, song and worship.</p>
<p class="Text">In the meantime by chance, plague broke out in Calcutta.</p>
<p class="Text">People in number began to suffer from this disease and die. Swami Vivekanand could not tolerate it and changed this religious Mutth into relief camp. He engaged all the spiritual priests in the service of the afflicted ones and said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Brothers! The form of religion is changing today. The Lord has put his true devotees and hermits to test. The struggle between humanity and epidemic has broken out today. Today every hermit of the Mutth has to appear at the test and he has to present the proof of his truthfulness. The treatment and service of the patients, orphans, crippled, weak and helpless is the part of religion. Treat and serve the patients so much, be so compassionate to them that no patient of the ‘Mutth’ may be overtaken by the death. In case, there is shortage of money, I will sell the land of the ‘Mutth’. Don’t worry! Service is the religious work. The service of the patients is the service of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">On the influential call of Swami Vivekanand all the renunciates of the ‘Mutth’ engaged themselves in the service of the patients as if they were doing a divine work.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Knowledge, devotion and wisdom is needed and not money</p>
<p class="Text">Swami Vivekanand’s (the then Narendra) father earned money in abundance but all soon, spent. The result was that when he died, the economic condition of the family had been in dole-drums and it became difficult even to pull on livlihood.</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji (Narendra) had passed B.A already at that time, but unfortunately he could get no job even after making great efforts. His mother and younger brothers and sisters reached the edge of starvation. </p>
<p class="Text">Even after graduation there was the financial problem. They were running through a very horrible condition. They were helpless to find out any way. No way out was visible. </p>
<p class="Text">Ultimately, being compelled and disturbed, he went to his guru (the preceptor) Shri Ramkrishna Paramhansji and narrated the pathetic condition of his financial stringency.</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Ramkrishna paramhansji thought over seriously. Then, he said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘You will get anything today whatever you demand from ‘Kalimata’ because your devotion is sincere. Strength lies in faith. The true devotion is always fruitful. Go, and demand.’</p>
<p class="Text">Swami Vivekanand was worried. What the helplessness not compells to do! The hungry man happens to do otherwise, even generally he forgets the discrimination of moral and immoral.</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji’s devotion was certainly unswerving. After midnight he went to the temple of Goddess ‘Kalimata’ for the demand of money. Oh! What happened! What a change! Now, the situation is, he is standing with folded hands and forgot suddenly what he wanted to say.</p>
<p class="Text">Having forgotten his worldly interest he began to speak the words—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Mother! I want nothing. Bless me with only knowledge! Bless me with devotion! Bless me with wisdom and sentiment of detachment from the worldly affairs!’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Ramkrishnaji was feeling astonished at his prayer. Why does he not demand money to get rid of starvation? He again sent him to the Mother Kali.</p>
<p class="Text">Not only once, but he sent him thrice to make his demand by assuring him fully that his demand would be fulfilled by the Mother. </p>
<p class="Text">But do you know what happened? Swami Vivekanand could not put the demand of money before the ‘Mata’ even a single time.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">To wipe away the ignorance from the world is also a big pious act</p>
<p class="Text">By the grace of his Guru (preceptor) Swami Vivekanand had already acquired the self-realization along with the vision of the Lord. In a garden of Kashipur he was attending his guru (preceptor).</p>
<p class="Text">Just after attaining knowledge a thought flashed in the mind of Swamiji—</p>
<p class="Text">I will pass my whole life in spiritual practice in seclusion enjoying the Supreme Bliss in a trance renouncing the world.’</p>
<p class="Text">The inner dweller of all beings Guru intuited it and said— </p>
<p class="Text">‘Vivekanand! Your selfish spiritual outlook is not proper, you are not absolved of duty to free the world and the society from ignorance is also religion and now you have to accomplish this practical righteous work. You have yet not to enjoy the spiritual joy in seclusion. Now, create the moral awakening by your knowledege and wisdom.’</p>
<p class="Text">Now what was alternative for Vivekanandji? </p>
<p class="Text">He obeyed respectfully his Guru. He dedicated himself with his body and mind in the service of human beings instead of sitting alone in any solitary place absorbed in the Brahmic bliss.</p>
<p class="Text">Morality had saved from sin.</p>
<p class="Text">Mahatma Gandhi fell in a bad company in his childhood. The bad company is poisonous like epidemic disease. By falling into a bad company a man is often bent upon doing the evil deeds, which he will not do in his common life probably.</p>
<p class="Text">Young Gandhi reached such a polluted circumstance of evil thought, where he could commit sin like smoking, eating meat and sexual enjoyment with any other woman. His wicked friends took him to a prostitute by coaxing him. He was in a very critical situation. A common youth of general character would have certainly deviated from the right path to the downfall but abruptly Gandhiji’s moral sacred sacraments of his childhood knocked at his mind. His moral wisdom proved to be the shield in his protection. </p>
<p class="Text">Just as a strong branch cannot be twisted easily according to wish or the blots of the unripe earthen pots cannot be removed after being baked, the same way the moral sacraments of childhood cannot be wiped easily. Gandhiji had been taught since his childhood that smoking, eating meat and sexual enjoyment with another woman is a dreadful sin. A man should beaware of them.</p>
<p class="Text">Gandhiji’s innerself began to curse him from the inner side. As a result he was saved from the sin. The practice and teaching of moral conduct and sacraments saved him from the mud of sin of adultery.</p>
<p class="Text">The moral wisdom always keeps us cautions, that is the divine voice that always guides a man to the right path.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Consideration of others service</p>
<p class="Text">After being released from Ahamedabad jail, Pt. Nehru said while addressing a public meeting that he was about to visit Malaya in near future.</p>
<p class="Text">After his speech was over a slip was given to him. It was written in it—</p>
<p class="Text">‘My son is ill. The certain medicine is needed for his treatment . That medicine is not available anywhere except Malaya. You are to proceed for Malaya. If you may bring this medicine while coming back, it will be your great obligation.’</p>
<p class="Text">That man had noted down his complete address below it.</p>
<p class="Text">Whereas a great leader of a country like India and on the other side, a common man’s insistence to him to bring medicine. If there had been anyone else, he would have thrown away the slip folding it. But Nehruji considered the service of others as the practical part of religion. Whatever the service of others is possible by anyone, he should do it. The service of the patients, preceptors, weak, old and helpless is the religion. Even in his most busy and most important programmes of Malaya, Nehruji did not forget to bring that medicine and on the basis of the original slip, placed safely, coming back to India, he got the medicine sent to that patient.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, Pt. Nehru was going to Kamala Nehru hospital. On the way, his sight fell on the crippled female sweeper of his father’s time. That female sweeper had fondled Nehruji in her laps. At once, he got his car stopped and got down and running he embraced her to his neck. He began to ask her with choking throat, ‘O my Lachhminiyamai! How are you now?’ Overwhelmed by love, the female sweeper, having blessed him, burst to tears in emotion. Pt. Nehru had such high sense of close affinity, others distress and mentality of service that he had the consideration of everyone. He made the full arrangement of the female sweeper’s whole life.</p>
<p class="Text">This is the event of 1929—</p>
<p class="Text">At the time of Mahatma Gandhi’s country tour, Shri Prakashji and Pt. Nehru had stayed in a room of Masorrie. Suddenly Shri Prakashji felt headache. When Nehruji returned  to his room being tired after the whole day work, he saw that Sri Prakashji was lying on the bed closing his eyes and the servant was rubbing his head.</p>
<p class="Text">Pandit Jawaharlal enquired of his condition. He got worried and with service and help point of view, after the walk of about one and half miles, he brought the tablets from the shop of a chemist to give him relief from the headache and made the patient Sri Prakashji to swallow the tablet. It lessened his pain and he could sleep comfortably.</p>
<p class="Text">In the same way in 1933 a member of Congress executive body, Shri Ram Saran felt headache. When Nehruji came to know it, he began to rub ointment on his head. In spite of the insistence to forbid, he remained rubbing his head till the patient fell asleep.</p>
<p class="Text">These occurences point out that there is practical side of the religion also which is useful in life at every step and at every moment. Religion is a practical life style. We should develop our soul and our virtues in the interest of the society. The virtues are tested at the time of distress. Even in the adverse circumstances and troublesome days let us remain holding the morality. This is the way of human evolution.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Man is the mine of virtues. The God is present  in our soul. It is needed to make Him apparent by our day-to-day behaviour in our daily life. Let us be a great man and live righteousness in life, then, this world will become elegant. Morality makes us a good citizen. Divinity is sleeping in you. By the noble deeds, nobility and honesty awaken it and activate it. Live morality in your behaviour. Really, we need active morality. Winning over religion experience it.<span></span></p>

<p class="Text">From time to time among the human beings such great personalities have been flashing who can be called a diamond discovered in garbage. About these brightening diamonds the matter is usually noticed in the columns of newspapers. Here is being given some inspiring events of fragrant life-blossoms collected from different places which prove even today—<span class="char-style-override-3">‘</span><span class="char-style-override-4">कीर्तिर्यस्य स जीवति’</span>, ‘They remain always alive who enjoy reputation.’ They were among these who are born, but never die.</p>
<p class="Text">1. I will not sell the priceless humanity for one hundred golden coins—</p>
<p class="Text">Once in a river of Italy such a flood occured that the entire bridge except a portion in the middle on which a house was situated, washed away. The afflicted family members of the house, peeping through the windows began to call the people standing on the border in the pathetic cry to protect their lives. The cracked part of the house was but to be washed away. The flood like the broadened jaws of the death was ready to swallow up the helpless.</p>
<p class="Text">...............Just to be flowed away! Just the end! just to drown, just to die!! Death............guffawing, a dreadful sight of death!!</p>
<p class="Text">The big rush of grieved viewers standing on the river bank was witnessing the pathetic sight. All and sundry wanted to save them, but one’s own life is dear to all. Who is there anyone to sacrifice one’s life for other’s one. What a selfish the world is!</p>
<p class="Text">In the meanwhile a rich man from the crowd feeling pity proclaimed loudly—</p>
<p class="Text">‘If anyone saves the men surrounded in trouble, I will give him one hundred gold coins in reward. Is there anyone such courageous to win this prize by saving the lives of these unfortunates from the flood?’</p>
<p class="Text">A poor man remained hearing. The feeling of benevolence was awakened in his mind.</p>
<p class="Text">The proclaimation was made again. It was proclaimed far and wide in a loud voice. He could not control himself.</p>
<p class="Text">The poor youth felt encouraged. He was a boatman, robust in body of irresistible boldness and zeal with the spirit of help of humanity, he reached the rest part of the river with his boat with indomitable courage and zeal without caring for the waves. The people were presuming to see his life in danger that he would also lose his life. The greed of reward will end his life from the world forever. The greed for money is blind.</p>
<p class="Text">But that courageous youth won. Facing hundreds of hardships, struggling against death and overcoming it, that brave, ultimately, brought the men in trouble safely to the bank again. </p>
<p class="Text">Now, all showered unreserved praises upon him. They were praising in exagerating words. The men escaped from the calamity were also bowing down to his obligation. </p>
<p class="Text">Then, that rich man began to give the reward of one hundred gold coins to that poor youth according to his proclaimation in the joyous mood. This was the understanding of the people that the poor youth would feel happy for his good fortune to get this big reward. </p>
<p class="Text">But what this!</p>
<p class="Text">That poor youth refused to accept that reward of one hundred golden coins.</p>
<p class="Text">The richman said hypocritically—‘You have saved the lives of these men from the jaws of death taking the risk of your own life. Every moment was dreadful for your life. You should accept your reward gladly, Take these one hundred gold coins. Count them whether they are exact in nuumber?’</p>
<p class="Text">Then, whatever the young boatman said is the treasure of humanity. All of us should feel proud of it even today.</p>
<p class="Text">He said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘I will not sell humanity by accepting one hundred gold coins. I have not saved these men in misery for the greed of money. Donate this amount among these helpless because their need is more important than mine.</p>
<p class="Text">It is truly said—</p>

<p class="Sub-Heading">2. The imitable sacrifice of a widow—</p>
<p class="Text">There is an old Pakka well of one hundred and fifty years old on the road going from Mungyer to Bhagalpur. The well is named as the well of Shyamo  Pisanhar near the well there are trees of Neem, Peepal and Gular, which cool shade has made a comfortable spot for the travellers to take rest. Long ago, a seventy years old lady named Shyamo had got it made. Her name still continues on the tongue of the people. The story runs as such—</p>
<p class="Text">When Shyamo was only 13 years old, within one year of her marriage she had become widow. She was insulted in her husband’s house and she was abused. She came back to her father. For sometimes, her parents remained alive but after their death the entire responsibility was thurst upon her. Shyamo thought—</p>
<p class="Text">‘The youth period will pass not by sitting idle but by doing labour and some work. To depend on the food earned by labour is man’s moral duty. So long as the limbs of the body are working, something must be done. Those only can remain steadfast in righteousness, who keep their body and mind engaged in some work. In the idle mind evil thoughts and passion keep revolving. There is always fear of going astray from the right path. I will earn the bread by manual labour and also do some benevolent deed also.</p>
<p class="Text">Well! This became her resolve. The God exists in the virtuous resolve.</p>
<p class="Text">She lived like an ascetic doing labour. The young widow got up two hours earlier in the night before the sun-rise and finished the grinding of five kg. flour till morning. Then, she worked on the water kiosk. Cutting the grass she sold it. Whatever the work was available to her, she used to do it earnestly. She cooked anybody’s food, sometimes she washed the clothes of someone or supported in cleaning. After taking some rest in the mid day, she again grinded the flour. After noon in the third part of the day she spinned the cotton threads on the spinning wheel. She developed the habit of labour. Whatever the work she got, she used to do it and thus, she remained collecting the money.</p>
<p class="Text">Throughout her life she earned five hundred rupees. She thought to invest it in some virtuous work. The place, where there is pitch road today, it was the rough road earlier. Water was no where to drink. The travellers felt a great difficulty in want of water. She spent the entire earning of her life in getting the Pakka well built. Those were the days of cheapness. In such a small amount that Pakka well was constructed. Even today that well reminds of that widow’s devotion to benevolence, hard labour, restraint and outstanding sacrifice. </p>
<p class="Text">Having an altruistic outlook can we not get any library, public inn or water kiosk etc., built?</p>
<p class="Text">The late Shyamo’s spirit gives the sermon of benevolence and generosity view. It may not attract the attention of others but she motivates that we should do the virutous acts in any situation wherever we stand; we should be charity-minded and we should never deviate from the moral path.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">3. Her glory is spreading fragrance even today—</p>
<p class="Text">When, the Ambala passenger train passed through the culvert near Bhatinda, abruptly, the engine driver, Daulatram saw with opened eyes that the front culvert was damaged. If the train passed over it, it would cause a fierce accident and thousands of persons would die the death of flies. His heart was overwhelmed with humane pity and pathos. He could not bear this fierce train accident; but what should he do?</p>
<p class="Text">The violent dance of death was before his eye-sight. He was thinking of any plan. </p>
<p class="Text">In the twinkling of eye he thought and took decision at once. He used the Vakuum brake with full force of his body and breath. He could think this only.</p>
<p class="Text">The engine stopped with a big jerk. The jerk affected the compartments, passengers fell down, some bent down to this or that side, but luckily none died.</p>
<p class="Text">At least about two thousand passengers were escaped from death. It was a great virtuous deed. But what happened with Daulatram?</p>
<p class="Text">The blow of the engine was so fierce that it got Daulatram entangled with the brake badly and he remained in the same position for a long time and Oh! He passed away there entangled with the brake. The flower of humanity fell into dust being faded untimely.</p>
<p class="Text">Undoubtedly, Daulatram’s death is the death of martyr. He was one of them who are born but never die and leave their glory forever. Daulatram’s sacrifice is still immortal. That is to illuminate the dark path of humanity.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">4. In the dreadful darkness of war the fragrance of humanity—</p>
<p class="Text">The event relates to the second world-war.</p>
<p class="Text">A Japanese soldier was wounded badly. He was bleeding, slowly and slowly growing weak and his face was fading. The black shadow of death was covering him. It was crystal clear that he was on the verge of death his life was only for a few moments.</p>
<p class="Text">The latent humanity of an Indian soldier got suddenly awakened even in the battlefield. He thought, ‘He could be enemy but it matters little! But at the moment while dying, he deserves pity. No question arises hostility at the last moments of death!’</p>
<p class="Text">He moved to provide tea to the wounded soldier in a small glass having poured down from his bottle. He put the head of the soldier in his lap with a great affection and touched the lips of the soldier with the cup of tea. He said—‘My friend! You noticed the heroism of a soldier of Budddha’s land on the war front, now taste tea with his affectionate hands.’</p>
<p class="Text">But oh! What! What a barbarism! Fierce wound to the heart of humanity!</p>
<p class="Text">That wicked Japanese in the return of the sympathy  pierced the thigh of the Indian soldier with his dagger the Indian soldier began to bleed.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the both fell down. The Indian soldier was wounded but the wound was not total due to the weakness of the Japanese soldier. .</p>
<p class="Text">After a few hours the Japanese wounded soldier was brought to the Indian hospital. The Indian soldier’s wound was also bandaged. When he became well, the same Indian soldier again went to him with a cup of tea and returned only when he made him drink tea lovingly. Now, the japanese soldier was feeling afflicted with the emotion of atonement. He was suffering from self-remorse on his action.</p>
<p class="Text">The Japanese soldier said—‘Now, I have come to realise why Buddha was born in your country, India only.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Humanity is the sweet smelling flower of life blossoming in the night, that smells sweet with fragrance even in the dread of darkness.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">5. He who happened to become extraordinary due to his kindness and courage—</p>
<p class="Text">A common employee of Railways was there as a gateman named PannaLal Pathak. His duty was to shut the gate of the main road at the time of the train-arrival. What a work of benevolence is possible in such a work of little importance? You will say, ‘No work of benevolence is possible here.’</p>
<p class="Text">But your presumption is not right.</p>
<p class="Text">The Barauda-Mathura passenger train was arriving at Ratlam station. The signal was down. Pannalal had gone to a side having closed the gate of the road according to his duty. It was eight in the night. By chance, three women labourers were coming back to their homes having finished their work of the whole day. They were tired and anxious to meet their children. The train was at a little distance. They thought to cross the line hurriedly. They came out through the wire guage silently. By chance their clothes got entangled with the wire guage and they came to a miserable condition.</p>
<p class="Text">Anyhow, after overcoming this problem they had hardly reached the rail line when they heard the jolting sound of the train and they got perturbed. They lost their courage. The rail engine was just in front of them to crush them to pieces.</p>
<p class="Text">Pannalal saw all this and showing a great courage he jumped upon the line.</p>
<p class="Text">In the same breath he pressed both the ladies in his arms and dragged them out of the railway line.</p>
<p class="Text">Now the train was just before; it was the next sight of death; yet he did not lose his patience and jumped to save the third female labourer, but alas!</p>
<p class="Text">The angry engine gave him a fierce blow and threw him away and the pitiless engine moved ahead crushing the third female labourer.</p>
<p class="Text">Panna Lal became unconscious in this struggle and it seemed that he would not be saved then.</p>
<p class="Text">But in the hospital he was treated under special care. The doctors tried their best to drag away this foremost chief of humanity from the jaws of death. God always supports the noble deeds. By luck, he recovered his health.</p>
<p class="Text">On the table, when he came back to his consciousness, these were the words that came out of his mouth—</p>
<p class="Text">‘What happened with the third woman?’ ‘Bravo the man! Even in these moments of death he had no care for his own self but his mind was absorbed in the worry of that third female labourer.’</p>
<p class="Text">The latent humanitarian attitude may awaken  anytime and do the wonderful act of benevolence. The deeds, which are not done, by any worldly temptation or greed, are done in the divine influence all of a sudden. This sleeping spirit motivates him very fast after awakening his divine spirit towards the virtuous deeds of benevolence.</p>

<p class="Text">It was morning. It was about 7 a.m. of the day. People were on their morning walk. A youth was also coming walking carefree and in an easy mood absorbed in thoughts.</p>
<p class="Text">His attention is just diverted towards the side of the road. What is this? Oh! What an odious sight it is!</p>
<p class="Text">There is a dog. Close to his ears there is a wound. Probably, this poor creature is the victim of someone’s hurt with hard wood. It is bleeding. The flies are buzzing. Foul smell is spreading. He is fluttering his ears again and again being afflicted with the pain; The flees fly away for a short while, but again sit overt the wound and begin to defile it and suck the blood. </p>
<p class="Text">The youth remained presuming the dog’s pain. Oh! What a pathetic sight! This dog can neither speak, nor get it bandaged and dressed by the doctors. Who is there to realise his pain? The spirituality pricked his mind.</p>
<p class="Text">He turned back from his morning walk. Now he was stepping fast towards the medical centre of an Ayurvedic doctor.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Vaidyaji! There is the need of a person for the dressing of a patient. The patient’s condition is very serious.’ He said in a pathetic tone. In the hope of the customer, the Vaidya asked anxiously, ‘Speak without any hesitation, who is ill at the residence?’</p>
<p class="Text">The youth said—‘There is none ill at my home, one who is patient is not considered by me less than anyone of my family members by any way.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Vaidya asked, ‘Who is that one?’ </p>
<p class="Text">The youth said in a very painful voice, ‘Near the ears of a forlorn dog his wound has been infested with worms. He is restless with pain. He cannot sit even for a moment in comfort. He is fluttering his ears in restlessness again and again. I am very much worried and grieved at his serious condition. Kindly give some medicine without any delay.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Fie! you are worried so much for this only—the Vaidyaji said, ‘For such the trivial dog, you have created such a storm! I had become perturbed  to see your facial appearance of perturbance.</p>
<p class="Text">He gave a medicine.</p>
<p class="Text">Then, laughing he said—‘My dear friend! Keep yourself guarding while doing good. Ultimately an animal is animal only. In the condition of pain the dog becomes about half mad-remains always restless............we apply the medicine hardly on the human patient. It is not an easy task to apply the medicine on a sick and wounded dog.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Vaidyaji was speaking on. The resolute youth paid no heed to his words. He came running to the dog. The wounded dog was now more restless. The flies had disturbed him badly by their sting. Many others were also passing by that way. While going on the path they looked towards it with hateful glance and making a face and casting the glance of contempt, moved ahead fast. Without hating the foul smell, the youth, neither pressed his nose nor was he frightened with his bite. </p>
<p class="Text">With a courage after wrapping a bamboo stick with cloth he dipped the stick into the medicine and getting the cloth soaked with medicine, touched the would with it mildly. The sharp medicine showed a fast effect on the dog’s wound, the dog got agitated. He tried to bite also but the courageous youth kept on doing the service, he did not bother for it at all. He remained absorbed in his work of benevolence. </p>
<p class="Text">The sick dog felt some relief and peace. Due to the effect of the medicine the wound was caused coolness and the flies also flew away by its foul smell. The dog felt comfort. </p>
<p class="Text">Now, he was lying peacefully and the youth was using the medicine properly coming closer to him. By waging his tail the dog was expressing his gratitude. He had realized that this man was any god of the previous birth. He had saved him from death.</p>
<p class="Text">Whereas the white coloured persons did not pay any attention towards the wounded dog, contrary to it this youth’s heart had melted with pity.</p>
<p class="Text">Do you know what was the name of this man? It was Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya who had brought a revolutionary change in India in the Hindu religion. Indian culture and in the field of education he had invested the most part of his life in educating the country.</p>

<p class="Text">America! The busy bank of a river! Awakeness and rare movement! It is early in the morning. The people are coming and going on the side of the river for bath. Some are enjoying the river water sitting on bank of the river being tired of walk and they are watching the rising waves and playfulness of the fishes springing with the waves. There is peace in the atmosphere, there is freshness and joy in the air. </p>
<p class="Text">‘Save, O save my child, anyone!’ A heart-touching voice of a woman was heard from a corner. It attracted everyone’s attention. The mother was pointing out towards the river weeping bitterly. Unfortunately her child had fallen down into the river and on the surface of the water was crying ‘Just drowned, just drowned.’ </p>
<p class="Text">The pathetic cry of the woman had spread all around till now. The people could not control. They gathered running at the spot of accident. Now, it was a good rush there. There was perturbation in everyone.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Save, O my son is drowning. Oh! Oh!! He will die, O! Anyone, show courage! save the child from the water!’ The mother was bitterly crying in pathetic lamentation. </p>
<p class="Text">Most of the people were simply the spectators standing there; but none dared to jump into the river and save the child. The life was dear to all. Why to die for the son of else one, If one drowns, let him drown! </p>
<p class="Text">‘Save, Oh, now just he will drown! Protect! Save!’ Just the moment a youth of about eighteen to nineteen years of age coming through the crowd with the speed like wind reached the river bank and jumped flat taking the aim of the child. All were in the amazement. What happened?</p>
<p class="Text">Was he not afraid of the strong current of the river? Had he no attachment with his life? Is he the victim of strong emotions and sentiments or hurriedness? Who knows! The fast flow of the river might swallow him! </p>
<p class="Text">Now all are concentrated to watch the youth’s method of swimming. Several times the youth seems to be entangled with the whirpool. Sometimes his mouth and nose seem to be fill with water badly, Several times he escapes hardly to be dashed with the hard hidden rocks. He is really, searching the child by taking dip.</p>
<p class="Text">It has taken long time in searching the child. All are looking with anxious eyes searching the youth at the spot of the occurence. He has not come out of the water where has he disappeared?</p>
<p class="Text">Isn’t it that he drowned in the water? It appears no hope of his return. Probably he passed away from the world forever.</p>
<p class="Text">But after some moments!</p>
<p class="Text">His black hair are somewhat visible on the water surface. Mark! Now he is seen swimming on the surface of the water. The moving legs are clearly visible. He is coming towards the river bank. </p>
<p class="Text">O God! The fainted child is also in his arms. After a little while the people see that the youth is putting the fainted child before his wailing mother.</p>
<p class="Text">He is fainted with fear. He has drunk some water. He will be well soon. Now take care, your child is safe.’ The mother is staring at the youth with the grateful eyes. The child was taken away to the hospital and by luck his life was saved. It was the youth’s courage and effort that brought back the life of the child from jaws of death even. Who was aware of that the child would be saved from the accident? The Lord’s grace is boundless.</p>

<p class="Text">His father was a labourer getting the monthly wages of Rupees two or three. His life was full of financial and social problems. It was hard for him to satisfy the hunger even. It was sufficient if anyhow the cloths were available to wear. The shoes and caps were the objects of luxury for them. If even the food was not available to the stomach’s fill then where was the question of other items like sweet or of a sweetened preparation rice and of milk, boiled together, a cake fried in ghee; chat and Pakauri? These items were the objects of dream for him.</p>

No doubt he was tempted and wished that his son should also become educated and able, in him the science and knowledge of the world had become worthy of honour in the civilised society. </p>
<p class="Text">But curse to the financial helplessness! He had nothing in his pocket to bear the expenses of school charges and buy the books, manage for the school uniform and when his son demands for the pocket expenses like other students what will be answer? </p>
<p class="Text">The father always thought all these and kept on the ambitions in his mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the child had grown up somewhat matured. When he saw the other boys of the village going to school with their school bags, he used to catch the corner of his father’s clothes and with tears in his eyes said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Father! All the boys of the village go to school to study with slate and pencils. I will also go. Bring books and slate for me also. I will also become great after getting education. I will also work as a clerk by sitting in the chair. It is the education that makes anyone great and famous. I will study with the concentrated mind and become a learned one.</p>
<p class="Text">The father stared the child with tearful eyes. He caressed his hands on the head of the son affectionately. Then, wiping his tears with great affection, describing his condition of poverty and helplessness before him he used to say—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Son! You have intense inclination for education you crave for getting knowledge from books. These are the symptoms of greatness. Your old impressions are very high and Sattvika. What a nice had it been if you would have been born in a rich family? Oh! Why were you born in this poor family? If your destiny had favoured you to become great, you would have not been the son of a poor like me. Oh! Curse to my poverty! I am unable to manage a little to educate my dearest son!’</p>
<p class="Text">While saying so tears streamed forth from his father’s eyes. His heart used to throb fast. He used to cling his dear son to his bosom with great affection and the sense of mineness. When he returned to normalcy from the upsurge of the emotion he said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Son! Don’t be disappointed. If winter comes can spring be far behind! Being grown up more, think of doing some labour so that first we may fill our stomach. And then in the spare time you may study also. I have no money at all in my pocket. At present to think of the study is quite useless.</p>
<p class="Text">Having heard the father’s talk of financial affairs, the boy had to suppress his feelings. What in fact this innocent child of small age but could do?</p>
<p class="Text">But his intense secret craving to become learned after being educated remained deep-rooted in his mind and day by day it surged up.</p>
<p class="Text">Even in the adverse miserable condition and poverty and despite discouraging reply of his father his courageous and zealous sentiment did not minimise. He was in search of favourable opportuning. Along with perseverance he had sufficient modesty and civility. He was sweet in tongue with everyone. His modest behaviour made many his friends. He befriended such good and gentle students who allowed him to read their books in spare time. Not only to this limit, but they who came being well educated after paying costly fees in the shools, used to teach this poor boy also something.</p>
<p class="Text">When the other rich boys played, this boy used to study in the streets in the dim light of the street lamps of the municipality.</p>
<p class="Text">He had no slate and pencils. He used to practise writing on the ground with the burnt coal. Someone gave him a pencil showing mercy. Then, he began to learn the alphabets by writing on the papers thrown as useless papers on the roads and streets. He learnt many words and sentences orally. Many lessons and stories of the syllabus books were committed to his memory.</p>
<p class="Text">The father began to curse for his poverty to see his perseverence. His heart also became restless to see his son’s hard labour and sharp wit and to make him educated.</p>
<p class="Text">This was the first chapter of the child’s life.</p>
<p class="Text">The life took the second turn. The new page of his life started. His poor father made a plan for more earning.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, with the purpose of more earning he set out towards Calcutta near his village with his son. He had no fare of the train. He started his journey on foot.</p>
<p class="Text">On the way he halted to take rest. The tired father said—‘I don’t know how long have I come?’</p>
<p class="Text">Unexpectedly the boy answered, ‘Nine miles father.’</p>
<p class="Text">The father was astonished.</p>
<p class="Text">‘How did this boy come to know it?’ he was thinking in his mind.</p>
<p class="Text">The boy himself explained—‘Father! It is written ‘nine’ on the close mile-stone. </p>
<p class="Text">The explaination of the answer was the sign of the child’s sharp wit. The father was overwhelmed with joy to see it.</p>
<p class="Text">The child Ishwar Chandra learnt the English numbers while going with his father. Due to the sharp talent of his son, again he fell into contemplation and returned with him.</p>
<p class="Text">On the way, he remained thinking—‘It will be a great crime towards such an inquisitive child to deprive him of the study due to poverty. I resolve that I will take my food only once a day keep all the family members to depend on only one meal but I will send Ishwar Chandra to school at any cost. </p>
<p class="Text">This resolve became the base of the child’s progress.</p>
<p class="Text">Coming back home he got Ishwar Chandra admitted in the school of his village. The boy studied with devotion and concentration of mind. He acquired the highest knowledge of his course book. He proved to be the best student of his school. All the teachers admired him excessively. Now, he had completed the study in that school. </p>
<p class="Text">It was impossible for a poor father to continue his study further away from the village. So, he had to refuse to continue his education; because it was beyond his capacity to bear the expences of his education further onward.</p>
<p class="Text">Then, Ishwar Chandra requested to get him admitted in any school, He will meet the expences of fees and education anyhow by doing the work of labour—He, himself, will search any job in the city. </p>
<p class="Text">The father agreed and got him admitted in a Sanskrit school of Calcutta. On account of his devotion, service and perseverence, Ishwar Chandra pleased the teachers of the college so much that he was exempted from the fees. He had become the sharer of his friends for the books.</p>
<p class="Text">By this way, he went on increasing his qualifications gradually. Constantly he went on rising up. Till the age of nineteen, he was well versed in Sanskrit Grammar, Literature, Figures of speech, Vedanta, Shastras. He became a great learned man of the country. Being impressed by his unequivocal knowledge and dignified conduct, an assembly of scholars honoured him with the title ‘Vidyasagar’ along with a certificate of honour and in his valuation he was offered the post of professorship in Sanskrit with due respect and request in the Fort William College of Sanskrit.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">By the virtue of labour and intelligence a labourer’s son became the historical man of India. His name was Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar.<span></span></p>

<p class="Shlok">पुरुष एवेदॸसर्वम्।    </p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Rigved 10/90/2) </p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘This entire universe is the form of the Supreme Lord. Considering the world as the manifestation of God, it should be served.’</p>
<p class="Text">The God is always present in the human mind and numberless times He illumines in the form of divine traits. The God has done extraordinary labour in the creation of human beings, its fruitfulness is only when man remains engaged in the fulfilment of divine purposes and benevolence for which he has been created. To make this world pleasant and well managed, The formless Supreme Lord needed a form, which had its consummation in the form of human being. </p>
<p class="Text">From time to time such examples are seen in our society and daily life which prove the existence of God in our inner self and He prompts us to do noble deeds. Such examples are quoted here.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Life-donation to save the patient</p>
<p class="Text">A surgeon Dr. Sudhir Gopal Jhingaran of N.E.R. Central hospital Gorakhpur in the Eastern U.P. sacrificed his life to save the life of a patient. It is so, the patient had been operated. The patient was weak already from the beginning and he had the shortage of blood in his body. His blood was tested and classified in group. After testing the blood of many persons the blood of his group could not be available. By chance, the surgeon Dr. Sudhir Gopal tested his own blood and it was of the same blood group of the patient. The blood of only the doctor could save the patient and there was not other way to save the patient. Now what to do?</p>
<p class="Text">Doctor Saheb began to think, ‘To raise ourselves higher above the materialistic narrowness, we will have to think that we have been blessed with this human class of birth for the welfare of others for the spiritual thoughts, for the benevolence, service and to accomplish the high ideals. If we do nothing for the human welfare then our human life is worthless. We must do something in the interest of this world—the Cosmic form of manifested God in addition to our body and family sustenance.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having thought so, Dr. Sudhir Gopal became ready to donate his blood to the patient. After one bottle of blood the patient came to require one bottle more blood. The doctor was again donating his blood that in the meanwhile some such reactions happened in his body that he died the same night despite the best possible treatment. God’s labour proved fruitful. That divine light extinguished but gave away the lesson to hundreds of souls the duty of human birth.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The Eye-donation of an old woman</p>
<p class="Text">In Allahabad the eyes of 70 years old Bengali woman have been jolted to two blinds successfully. The old woman had bequeathed her eyes to the hospital as a donation. She had got written in her will—‘If any part of my body may be used in the welfare of any other one, I consider my life worthful. This is the motive behind the boundless talent, divine knowledge, this human spirit that has been blessed by the God to the mankind that he should remain dedicated in benevolence till the last breath. Let my eyes be kept protected and use them to any needy youth either male or female and God’s creation of mine may prove useful.’</p>
<p class="Text">The doctor of the hospital has transplanted her one eye in a ten years old blind girl and the second in 22 years old youth. Both of them have regained the eye-sight.</p>
<p class="Text">In the same line there is an other example A six years old girl named Jyotsana Ben Patel of Bombay city donated her eyes after death. This girl had died in the hospital of the city in 1965. The parents of the girl donated her eyes to the Gvt. eye bank at once. As a result the pupils of a blind boy were transformed and one another man was surgically operated for the vitium transplantation.</p>
<p class="Text">The news report of Nagpur is as such—In the local Medical College, the donated eyes by a 60 years old woman were transplanted in the eyes of 30 years old young lady. She had lost her eye-sight at the age of five due to the smallpox.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The imitable ideal in the life of scarcity</p>
<p class="Text">Even in the afflicted with scarcity and hardships, burdened with the load of many responsibilities there is the glimpse of God.</p>
<p class="Text">The matchless ideal presented by the teachers and employees of D.A.V. college, Muzaffarnagar, in the help of teacher’s orphan family on his sudden death is imitable certainly.</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Sitaramji, head of the department of economics in the college died on 17th of july 1965. There was left no support for the widow, two sons and four daughters of Shri Sitaramji. The two sons were dependent. They could earn nothing. The earning man became the victim of death. The two daughter should be married without delay. </p>
<p class="Text">It is not very difficult to presume the result of the lecturer’s death in such a financial stringency and manage problems and what problems and hurdles would have been created before Shri Sitaramji’s widow? It is not hidden to anyone about the poor financial stringency of the teachers. Their earning remains confined to their livlihood only. There are rare who leave some money after their death. As regards they who have a big family, they have no end of their miseries.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord flashed through the college employees. There was a murmuring in their innerself—‘You should support the family of your late colleague by all means.’ All decided to support the family in misery.</p>
<p class="Text">Do you know what was this decision?</p>
<p class="Text">All of them including the peons and even the sweepers decided to donate the amount of their D.A. and they would be depositing it for the coming three years. Thus, with the money collected the family will be supported for all the purposes like marriage etc.</p>
<p class="Text">It is not difficult to imagine the problems of the teachers and employees who took this vow; but the humanity considers them the ideal who try to solve other problems at the risk of their own sufferings and they are the inspiring ones.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The honesty of a Rikshaw-puller</p>
<p class="Text">The news report of Faridkot. The twenty-one years old Rikshaw-puller, Ram Chandra spent his whole day in search of the stranger traveller, who had left his suitcase on the rikshaw by mistake and in hurry he had gone away at his work. That suitcase contained the jewellery worth of about forty-five thousand rupees. If he desire, he could grab the entire wealth, but that Rikshaw-puller understood the moral responsibility of human life and considered his success in fulfilling it. At last, openning the suitcase, with the support of the address written in a letter, he found out the owner of the jewellery and approaching him, he handed over the suitcase as it is. The owner of the jewellery wanted to give the Rikshaw-puller Rupees five hundred as reward. First he refused to accept it. After insistence, he took that money and donated it in the account of ‘Jawaharlal Nehru-Smarak.’</p>
<p class="Text">The God in man guides him to the right path. If there is intensity of desire and there is need, firmness and strong assiduity, the path of benevolence is certain.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The atonement of mistake</p>
<p class="Text">A news concerning an event of Cuttack has been published in the newspapers. A unique type of occurence of atonement by a student for his mistake has happened. The event is as follow—</p>
<p class="Text">A student of class VIIIth of Shekh Bazar came from the city to the station by Rikshaw. He gave a note of Rupee one to the Rikshaw-puller to pay twelve annas as Rikshaw fare, but the Rikshaw-puller returned the note because he had no change of four annas to return. The student having said, ‘Just I bring the change. Stay for awhile—went on the platform inside and he was absorbed in reading the magazine on the book stall so much that he forgot that he had to give the fare even to the Rikshaw-puller.</p>
<p class="Text">After half an hour when he came to remember taking the change from the book stall he rushed out of the station but unfortunately he could not find the Rikshaw-puller there. The innerself of the student disturbed him badly. He began to think—‘Oh! What a sin I committed! I grabbed the wage of a poor labourer! I deprived a poor man of his food. He would be hungry being in a sad mood. While searching for, it became late he began weeping in sobs in the night; yet he could not be found out. Just near the motor stand. When the people enquired of the cause of his weeping, he explained to them as it was and began to say—‘A poor Rikshaw-puller was deprived of his wages due to my mistake. I am compunctioning for it.’</p>
<p class="Text">After the persuation by others, he went home by another Rikshaw with tears in his eyes but he donated twelve annas to the other crippled beggars before he departed.</p>
<p class="Text">It is true that if the internal ambition is firy, to fulfil it if there is firm resolve and strong effort, the way of benevolence occurs to one’s mind. Anyway becomes veritable to offer support or service to others.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Sacrifice for benevolence</p>
<p class="Text">A man naming Anand Rao belonging to Chhindwara district Jabalpur has been honoured with the president award after death of sacrificing his life to save the life of a child who was drowning. As it is said that a ten years old child was playing on the weak cover of steel covering a deep pit of drains. That covering could not bear the load of the child and suddenly collapsed. It was filled with water upto a good height. Late Sri Anand Rao was standing near by. He did not care for his own life to save the child’s life and he, himself jumped into the pit. Though, he was successful in his purpose, but he died due to the poisonous gas and air of the pit due to choking of breath before he could come out. For this great heroic deed of benevolence, the government of India appreciated it and has awarded him ‘The President Award’.</p>
<p class="Text">In the same line an other news—</p>
<p class="Text">New Delhi. By saving the life of three ladies from drowning at the risk of his own 16 years old boy naming Subhas Chandra’s father, R.R. Khurana was awarded with ‘Life-Saving-Award’ (First class) posthumously by the chief commissioner in a meeting organised at his residence.</p>
<p class="Text">The whole event is as such—Subhas Chand the student of Kamarshal Higher Secondary School of Dariaganj was wandering about with his three friends near Kudasiaghat on 8th of November 1962 when a loud cry was heard from the Ghat side. They at once reached the ghat running. They came to know that a few women had been caught into a whirlpool. Having put off his shoes, Subhas jumped into the river, Yamuna in his dress on his body. He saved all the three drowning women but could not save himself and sank into the Yamuna river. When the story of this benevolent boy was narrated in the organised meeting, his father’s forehead raised high with pride.</p>
<p class="Text">There is hidden divinity inside the mankind and its glimpse reflects from time to time. By benevolence man’s divinity develops more and more. By adopting this attitude a man becomes god, gets peace and becomes famous and gets joy in this world and the next world.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The Post Office without employee</p>
<p class="Text">In a village of Rajkot (Saurashtra) a post office without any employee is running successfully just to make an experiment. In that village of Junagarh the postcards and envelops have been kept in a box. Anyone who needs takes out and drops the money of its cost. Due to this honesty that Post office is running properly. This Post office has not suffered from the loss of even a single rupee till now. By developing the tendency of doing good, man proceeds towards divinity and presents the atmosphere like heaven.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">I can do nothing against rules</p>
<p class="Text">Saint Socrates was sentenced to death. The people had not understood his ideology rightly. There are enough foolish-minded in the world. Due to this reason, Socrates was in condemned cell of the jail as a prisoner who has been sentenced to death.</p>
<p class="Text">His most favourite pupil, Crito thought of a plan to save him. He wanted to save him by anyway right or wrong. By giving bribe, Crito entered the jail secretly and spoke before Socrates with folded hands—</p>
<p class="Text">‘I have managed in all respects to save your life. Don’t delay and escape from the jail silently. All the arrangements outside the jail to run away safely, have already been made. Nobody will get any clue of your escape from the jail. You will be made to reach any other country. The entire earning of my whole life is presented to your feet. Well! Only your life is required.’</p>
<p class="Text">It was a golden opportunity for Socrates to protect his life. Who is there such a man whose life is not dear to him? A man wants to protect his life by anyway, proper or improper.</p>
<p class="Text">But on his proposal Socrates answered soberly— ‘I cannot accept such immoral proposal. I consider it a deceit to the God by going against the rules of that country where I was born, where my mother and father have been living, where I have breathed in the air and where I have been brought up.’</p>
<p class="Text">In reality, the base of spiritual exaltation is not any method of worship, rituals or the practice of spirituality but the living of the divine qualities, honesty and  will to stick to the discipline can be the base only. For the attainment of God, heaven, salvation and spiritual peace, the essential factors are self-control, moral conduct and magnanimity without their achievement how can be worthy of redemption?</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Corpse Donation of Ownself</p>
<p class="Text">Sr. Ed. V. Narsingh Rao an advocate of Gudar in Hyderabad has already donated till now; his blood forty times to save the life of the patients but his tradition of sacrifice and renunciation has yet not stopped. He considers the service of God in the service of the humanity. He wants to make the human life fruitful. So, he has bequeathed his dead body to the Osmania General Hospital—Superintendent’s name in his will. He has said this also in his will that his eyes should be kept reserve for the needy.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Old Widow’s all in all given in charity</p>
<p class="Text">An old lady named Smt. Joharia Bai has donated her entire property in charity to the State government to open a girls School in her village Siwani in the district Bilaspur.</p>
<p class="Text">The widow donated her property to the Dy. Finance minister of Madhya Pradesh, Sri S.P. Dubey at the time when he was delivering a speech in a public meeting in the village. When the local leader was greeting the minister, the old woman went up on the dais and handed over the papers of her land costing seven hundred rupees and one thousand five hundred in cash to him. She gave words to donate rupees five hundred more in the near future. This old woman appealed to the Dy. minister to start the construction work of the school soon so that she might see the school flourishing in her life time. She says that the devotion of God is inherent in the expansion and discrimination of knowledge. To provide opportunity to others to acquire knowledge is the real worship.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The dutifulness of a peon</p>
<p class="Text">The robbers thrashed badly to a school peon named Shri Durgaprasad of Bulandshahar and looted his all the cash. When they began to snatch his cycle forcibly, he resisted stubbornly. That cycle was the school property and thus, it was his moral and pious duty to protect the public property. He did not give this cycle to them until they fired shots and made him fall down on the ground. That peon was the employee of Sharma Higher Secondary School, Bulandsahar.</p>
<p class="Text">He was going to his village to attend an important work when on the way the robbers surrounded him. They took all the cash what he had with him forcibly. When they began to take away his cycle forcibly, he said in the humble words—‘You can take all my possessions but I cannot give you the belonging of the school at any cost; because this is a public property. I consider it most important to guard it.’</p>
<p class="Text">The dutifulness is the great worship of the God. There is the source of constant overflow of virtues and noble deeds in benevolent human heart; because God remains present in his mind in the inanimate form.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-32">Sacrifice and love</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The excellent fruit of virtuous deed is inevitable</p>
<p class="Text">There is the hidden moral rule of law of the Supreme God guiding the whole universe. There is the abundance of spirituality present inside the human beings and it leads him towards noble deeds. The man leading his life according to this moral divine rule of law remains always happy, healthy and talented and fully contented. Contrary to it, the man following the immoral polluted path of sin, remains suffering from distress; disturbance and self-contempt in his inner life.</p>
<p class="Text">In the words of Prof. Laljiram Shukla—‘Man behaves against the moral law in passion and demonical frenzy, guided by selfish motive or due to ignorance but he has to bear the punishment of the God for his immoral conduct. After suffering from pain he comes to the right path of nobility. For the noble and auspicious deeds pleasure, contentment and self-satisfaction and for the sin, disease, sorrow, dissatisfaction is the real fact. This rule is fully in accordance with reason. </p>
<p class="Text">The lives of numberless persons have revealed this truth. The moral conduct has provided them wonderful benefit. Here, some  experiences of such persons are being quoted in their own words—</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Virtuous deed saved from the hanging</p>
<p class="Text">Sri Gopal Newatia has written his experiences in connection with Ram Lal Nai (the barber) in the following words—</p>
<p class="Text">‘That day, while massaging his body Ram Lal Nai asked him, ‘Babuji, Was the case of Bombay decided? </p>
<p class="Text">I startled a bit! What astonishing one side Bombay and the otherside this rural village! Before I could reply he again said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘You will see, Babuji he will be acquitted by the jury; but I have marked the eyes of the judge. He will not acquit him.</p>
<p class="Text">The words of the Nai confined to the Nai! What this judge, how his eyes and this Ram Lal the witness! But it did not stop here, it continued—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Babuji! The Bombayite fired shots only, but I had used the dagger, in twice three pieces............!’ </p>
<p class="Text">Hardly I heard than I jumped and sat down. </p>
<p class="Text">He said, ‘Babuji! Don’t get startled up. Ram Lal is not now a murderer but the servant of your majesty! Yes! But the hands are the same that had used the sword.’</p>
<p class="Text">It came to my mind to ask when, whom and why he killed? But I did not consider it proper to interrupt his narration to be deprived of the taste. Ram Lal continued his story—</p>
<p class="Text">‘In my case, thousands of my villagers gathered in the courtyard of the court and made prayer of my acquital. But, my lord! The day I stepped in the court and my eyes looked on the face of the judge, I came to understand that the fact was not hidden to him. And it happened so also as I have already been sentenced for being hanged to death.’</p>
<p class="Text">My amazement had no bound to hear this because Ram Lal the convict of hanging-sentence was physically present before my very eyes presuming my curiocity, he began to say himself—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Babuji! There is nothing astonishing here. This is all the fruit of the past noble deeds. The act of benevolence is the true religion. The God repays a good return of our every noble and meritorious act. If we do any noble work even hidden, the virtuous deed remains deposited like money deposited in the bank and does the work of armour in the difficult days. The God repays the return of our every work either good or bad.</p>
<p class="Shlok">राम झरोखे बैठिके, सबको मुजरा लेय।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जाकी जैसी चाकरी, वाको वैसो देय॥</p>
<p class="Text">This Ram is the second name of moral rule. Since I had come to senses, I had an attitude of benevolence and doing service and help of others in the best possible way. In any fair or gathering in the neighbourhood all the time for day and night I used to make the thirsty persons drink the water. I have distributed grams among the hungry persons from my own pocket, I have donated cloths to the beggars, I have provided medical treatment to the animals; I have never cut any green tree, I have never done any immoral deed, this is the collected fruit of all the noble deeds, that this Ram Lal escaped from being hanged.’ </p>
<p class="Text">I was taking interest in the occurence of Ram Lal’s life. </p>
<p class="Text">He was not only acquitted from death sentence but from the punishment of 25 years in the jail also. It was all the reward of his noble deeds and ............ and .......... Babuji! if you want I should tell its secret also. </p>
<p class="Text">I was already taking interest in these expereinces just like in detective stories. So I nodded head in agreement. Being stimulated Ram Lal again began to narrate.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Now, just you see, how much does the merits remain collected and helps the man in his rainy days? Hearing the news of death-sentence, my wife wept bitterly but I had not any trace of agony on my face. I was confident that the devotee of the Lord, who had fallen by chance into trouble, could not die premature death, then where is the question of death sentence? I have seen the convicts of death-sentence in the jail, their condition becomes worse than that of hell till the decision of appeal. To live, to eat, to sleep, toilet all in a single room and the worst is as if a naked sword is hanging on the head. But believe my lord! Ram Lal had full faith in the God’s moral justice. That he would not be hanged and it so happened also. I appealed in the higher court and there the punishment was minimised to twenty five years of imprisonment only. The God granted me my life.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Twenty-five years! This punishment was also exempted.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘No, my lord! There also my previous noble deeds rescued me. This was the secret reward of leading my life according to the moral rules of conduct that I got. Just after two years a war broke out and it was announced that the prisoners who would like to go to fight in the war would be exempted from punishment. Well! What more needed? Hundreds of prisoners like me became ready and it took the form of an army. Whereon one side this long imprisonment, shackles, handmill and other troubles and the other side this army-uniform, food, open air and carefree life. This was all the result of merits. It is only the moral law of the Supreme that protects under such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Text">I saw a number of countries as a soldier of the army. Even went and came from America but mark this hidden support of God! I simply a prisoner of jail was travelling throughout the world.’ </p>
<p class="Text">I asked—‘Ram Lal! Did you fight ever?’ </p>
<p class="Text">He said—‘Babuji! Enough! It was the only desire that remained unfulfilled. In the war the use of dagger is far away, even the opportunity to touch the butt to any one’s body could not be available! That was the war of hand-grenade and bomb. The chance to fire with gun was also only once, at the time of roll-call when the bullet from any side came and pierced into the thigh.’</p>
<p class="Text">While describing this Ram Lal’s chest puffed up. I cast my praising look. He went on narrating—</p>
<p class="Text">‘The bullet hurt me but I was conscious. In usual way after being wounded, the death comes before eyes but I tell you truly Babuji! I was confident that the Lord was finding out some way to save me from this trouble also. Then, such was divine device really. I felt as if who had released me from noose of hanging and relieved me from the twenty five years of imprisonment, this amassed capital of virtuous deeds will support me this time also and Babuji! You see it is the support of that Almighty that has made me to sit in this position before you remaining alive.’</p>
<p class="Text">It was beyond my imagination that the life of a village barber could be so full of events; but the influence of noble deeds was quite true. Ram Lal had been discharged from the army also on the ground of sickness. </p>
<p class="Text">With this experience it is clear that the acts of noble deeds are the source of lifelong benefits. The acts done according to the moral wisdom provide spiritual force.</p>
<p class="Text">One whose innerself is illuminated with spiritual knowledge, becomes capable to know one’s vices and the sentiment is created to remove them as soon as possible. Where there is light, there is no possibility of darkness. In the same way where there is moral wisdom, the hidden support will be there without the least doubt. The devotion to God means the feeling of love, benevolence service to all the living beings. The only way to love the God enshrining all beings and do the moral duty is to relieving them of their sufferings and to make them happy as far as we can do earnestly. Righteousness is not to be confined to the tongue only but it is to be given practical stablity through actions.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Dady, used to sit there to guide the right way to the travellers</p>
<p class="Text">Miss Sunanda (Bombay) has written an event occured in Western countries as follows—</p>
<p class="Text">That year, I was on a visit of ‘Switzerland’ in summer. The direct road going to ‘Gathard mountain pass’ was passing near my rented house to stay there in Lugano; but another road also was going somewhere else from there—On the hill usually, the travellers might have been catching that road by mistake. But just beside my house, there lived an old gentleman.</p>
<p class="Text">In the house there were only two members—he and his daughter Leena. In any accident the gentleman had lost his energy to walk. So he had to take the support of wheelchair to move anywhere. He was a great benevolent and given to service. He considered it piety to use his body in ‘others’ service whatever could be possible by him. Because of his feeling of service he got up early in the morning daily and pushing his chair anyhow he reached there where the road had been divided into two directions. He used to sit there till the sun-set reading books under the shade of a tree. Leena brought tea, breakfast etc., for him there. </p>
<p class="Text">When my curiosity grew intense, one day I asked Leena—‘Why does the old dady sit on the side of the road instead of taking rest?”</p>
<p class="Text">Hearing my question she remained silent for a moment. Then said—‘My dady has the dominant humanitarian feeling of service to the mankind as a whole. His legs are meaningless even then he wants to serve the travellers more and more. All the beings of the world fulfil the desire of their welfare, pleasure and self-interest themselves but dady is of the view that man is blessed with the abundance of opportunities to become more thoughtful, considerate and wise and its true usefulness lies in dedicating himself in the welfare of the world. He should be guided by the feeling of human welfare. Dady sits there to guide the right path to the travellers. If any traveller turns to the wrong direction he guides him the right direction.’ </p>
<p class="Text">It is his version—‘If I could make my worthless life worthful for others even by this way, I would be feeling pleasure of life. What we say, let it be practised in our own life first, it will give a good reaction itself. By fondling even the beasts and birds begin to show affinity then what to talk of mankind? He remains always fond of affinity. You do good to others and your good is served first. Every particle spent for the welfare of others comes back numberless times more. My soul feels a great joy, peace and contentment by this work of guidance.’ </p>
<p class="Text">From Michigan, Sweden, Brazil etc., he has got letters of gratitude also for guiding the travellers. Dady considers these letters the invaluable treasure.</p>
<p class="Text">While saying this, Leena’s throat choked and I was amazed to see the feelings of social service of that man guiding the travellers sitting under the tree.</p>
<p class="Text">This memoir makes it clear that if a man lives a truthful life, it is good enough. The true glory of man is in the fact that should be called a man of virtue, civilized, cultured and gentle. The man’s ambition should be to be possessed of the rich store of humane virtues in excess. The best criterion of anyone’s progress, prosperity and intelligence is that he should enhance his divine humanitarian virtues overcoming his vices and make his life ideal and exemplary. Among the human duties the greatest objective is the self-evolution. There can be nothing more success in life than the service of the mankind.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The unique feeling of benevolence of a criminal</p>
<p class="Text">This is a news of Bermingham. A criminal whose name was William Boven had committed the murder of his wife in 1961. After five years of the case trial, he was convicted for the murder and awarded the punishment of death-sentence. Before death sentence, the criminal was asked for his last wish. He said—‘I am unlucky that I could do no virtuous deed in my lifetime but before death my moral wisdom has awakened and I want to do any work of benevolence so that I may die peacefully. Before death I want to do such a work as may be set an example for future and may prove to be the source of inspiration for the other unfortunates like me. I have decided that my both the eyes should be donated to any blind to provide them sight. I am sorry that any other part of my body cannot be useful for anyone otherwise I would have given them also.’ </p>
<p class="Text">According to the last wish of the criminal his both the eyes were taken out and seating him on the chair of electricity he was sentenced to death. The eye-surgeon planted his one eye to a blind old man and the second eye to a blind young girl and thus, they began to see.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">A virtuous Rikshaw-puller</p>
<p class="Text">A news of Roorky is as such—A teacher’s mother fell ill seriously. He called in a doctor for treatment in hurry. But unfortunately the teacher’s old mother had died before the doctor came. The teacher asked the doctor to excuse and said—‘Sorry for your trouble you have taken to come here.’</p>
<p class="Text">The doctor answered—‘No matter. Well! Please pay Rupees five as the fees of my visit.’ Fees without treatment! Begging pity and with helpless glance the teacher saw towards the doctor. The pathetic wailing cry of his wife and children was being heard coming from inside the house. But the doctor left the place when he got his fees. He was not the least pitiful.</p>
<p class="Text">The teacher had brought the doctor by a Rikshaw. He gave eight annas to the Rikshaw-puller as its fare; but he refused to accept this money. While departing, he spoke in a sweet voice—</p>
<p class="Text">‘As your mother has died and I should charge the fare? I am not the doctor, but a poor Rikshaw-puller. It is the man who supports at the time of misery. My heart is not a stony heart.’</p>
<p class="Text">The teacher said to him—‘You have done labour. You have shed your sweat; that is why you are entitled of wages.’ Please, accept it.’ </p>
<p class="Text">But the Rikshaw-puller went away without taking the fare.</p>
<p class="Text">The doctor of materialistic view and the Rikshaw- puller of the spiritual view are the examples for us to follow. Really, the religion means to assist in maintaining the society well arranged, well controlled and well developed. But it is a matter of sorrow that such religion should be given importance. That importance is not being given today but unless that feeling to serve others likewise does not develop. The feeling of serving of a man as one ownself is present unless in every particle develops in the human beings even the strict rule of law cannot check up the vices of mankind. We should feel proud of following the divine moral rules and having faith in them. Let us go on developing virtues in us.</p>
<p class="Text">By developing the divine merits in our conduct and behaviour only our society can progress. Out of the religious treaties ordained in the ‘Smritis, Sacrifice, forgiveness, kindness, equanimity, service and benevolence are the foremost. If these divine properties are to provide peace and contentment in the individual life, that can be conducted in the society also. As a result its fruitfulness in social life is also but natural. </p>
<p class="Text">The auspicious deed depends on the purity of innersense. The more purity is in our mind and reason the more auspicious work will be done by us. He who becomes noble by nature cannot do evil deeds even if he befalls in adverse situations.</p>
<p class="Text">Generally, a common man thinks that he will be exempted from the fruit of his evil deeds by worship, muttering, austerity, Yagya, fast, the sight of gods etc. But it is certain that we have to bear the fruit of virtues and sin at any cost. It is an other thing that some times virtues dominate the vices and sometimes the vices dominate the virtues. If the merits increase the sins minimise. If the evils increase, the sins go on increasing.</p>
<p class="Text">Man is the store of both—the virtues and vices. By the study of Mahabharat we come to know that whereas Duryodhan, Karn etc., had the demerits, they had praiseworthy merits also. Due to the excess of evils the Kauravas were defeated and due to the excess of merits the Pandavas were winners.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">The highest merit is to go to the shelter of the preceptor (Gurudev), God or Supreme Lord and obey their bidding. The Lord exempts him from all the evils who has got this merit.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-33">Self-effort is the best</p>
<p class="Text">You consider that you can progress in your life only by the support of others. We depend on others. We require their help and support. But as a fact, this thought is wrong point blank.</p>
<p class="Text">God has made man complete in himself. Those elements, that cause progress and uplift in life, have been permeated in abundance in him. Man’s mind and spirit is filled with plenty of wonderful mental, moral and spiritual powers. In his evolutionary thoughts there is plenty of material of life formation.</p>
<p class="Text">There are different directions of there powers. You are free to follow the path what you want or where to go. Courage and valour, patience and struggle, labour and effort, devotion and knowledge etc., are the different directions of thought. The man who proceeds to anyone of the directions, goes on proceeding a head higher and higher to the same direction by the power of his thought. He takes its advantage by its use in the active field of life.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Our ignorance</p>
<p class="Text">Sometimes man remains ignorant of his power for a long time. In want of this true knowledge, he remains floating about aimlessly like the leaf floating in the air. Then, abruptly by the contact or an association with anybody or by fellowship with saints his faith develop in his powers and in the ripe age of his life he starts his progress.</p>
<p class="Text">They who are not mindful of their energy hidden in their mind, body and soul, remain poor, agonised and weak throughout their life. In their whole life they fail to attract the attention of the people. Numberless persons of such type were born in this world and like the animals and birds they wasted their life and perished it to the dust. They are the braves and vigorous who deserve the entire enjoyments of this earth. There is nothing in this world for the cowards and idles.</p>
<p class="Text">We are amazed at the success of great scientists. We stare in amazement and are astonished on the inventions, invented by them. We stand amazed to see the sky-kissing buildings of the men of riches. We clap with joy to see the demonstration of the artists art and skills. We remain pondering over for a long time on the miracles of the mountaineers riding higher on the peaks of the great mountains. The Western countries have left the fish and birds far behind in the field of ships and aeroplanes. Man is reaching the moon today. These are the wonderful miracles of man’s prowess.</p>
<p class="Text">Today, our country is overpowered by cowardiceness and laziness. Such a long period of our independence has passed, but we could not make that progress what was ought to be achieved by us basically. We have failed to remove the illiteracy, non-understanding and poverty of our country. We have failed to increase that production in our fields which was ought to be done. We have not made progress in the field of science and knowledge. It clearly means that we are not hard-working and painstaking to a great extent.</p>
<p class="Text">In the Vedas there a very useful saying—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कृतं मे दक्षिणे हस्ते, जयो मे सव्य आहित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">गोजिद् भूयासमश्वजिद् धनंजयो हिरण्यजित्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Rigved 7/50/8)</p>
<p class="Text">It means—‘O the man! Make effort with your right hand and be confident that the success is sure in the left hand, achieve the cows, horses and gold etc., invaluable objects with your hard-working  and painstaking efforts.’</p>
<p class="Text">This is our great weakness, We repent that we could do nothing in our life. In any sphere of life we could not make any remarkable progress. We are frustrated with failure. Its, reason is clear that we did not make hardworking efforts as the part of our life. Our life and our country could not make that satisfactory progress really which was ought to be done by us on account of laziness and remaining lethargic.</p>
<p class="Text">In the moments of helplessness and disappointment, the hidden prowess of our mind proves to be the true supporter for us. When the man stands on his own legs and does not expect any support from others, he comes to stand at the gate of success.</p>
<p class="Text">You should be valorous. Take the work and plannings in our own hand with new zeal and courage. Identify yourself of your courage in the sphere of your work what you have taken in hands. Then, it is certain that you are not a coward and weakling.</p>
<p class="Text">Mind it that you are endownd with hundreds of types of powers. You have plenty of materials to change the directions of life and society towards the progress. You, yourself, create in you the powers of courage, vigour, efforts, labour, patience and sturggle by your firm resolve and by their use you take advantage in the active sphere of life. If you neglect and don’t become serious about your these divine powers, you will remain miserable and weak throught your life. The braves only deserve the enjoyments of the earth. There is everything in the world—wealth, property, respect, dignity and high status but to gain it, men’s perseverance is needed.</p>
<p class="Text">If the prowess is not awakened, you will get nothing. In true sense he is man who bears manliness, the second name lustrous element, in his character, he is called man, in fact without prowess he is a jackal or mouse in the shape of man.</p>
<p class="Text">Search out your hidden original power. Contemplate over the works what you can do better than others in the better artistic way. What are the fields where you are superior and better than others? What are your characteristics? To depend on others and remain sitting idle is good for nothing. God helps those who help themselves. You will be entitled of God’s support only when you work with your own hands. Only the self—supporting man can make progress. Manliness is a must in your life to be called a man. It has been said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">रुहो रुरोह रोहित:।          </p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved 13/3/26)</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">It means—‘The man of perseverance and making efforts, gets the height of progress. The fatalists, depending on fate only and lazy will remain always helpless, destitute.’<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-34">You are a great man</p>
<p class="Text">Regarding our body, mind and circumstances, our several actions are done unwillingly and unknowingly. The actions which we consider being done willingly, are often the result of any excitement.</p>
<p class="Text">When any singer learns well to play on any musical instrument, then later on he does not need at all to pay attention to the movement of his every finger. While playing on his instrument. If he is concentrated to the words he is singing while playing on musical instrument, his fingers will work automatically exactly at the right place and according to the melody, the pitch-rhythm will come out. The same is the condition of our all actions. All these actions are done by our hidden mind. While doing any habituated action, the outer mind wanders about anywhere else, even then, by the influence of hidden mind the action goes on being done in its own way silently.</p>
<p class="Text">In our life we are in practice of doing any new work always which we are not even aware of. Some of them are of good habits and some bad. First, in the beginning they have light effect on us because of being ignorant of them, but in due long course of time when they become deeply rooted, it becomes very difficult to get rid of them. The habit of chewing betel, smoking, meat-eating, the dirty passion of seeing movies, using the rude and harsh and prideful words etc., among the friends and in the society start very minutely but with the passage of time they become deeply rooted in our life. The tendency of theft and crime among the children or the wicked passion of sex among the youths remain, growing up slowly and slowly. First, a very small act becomes the cause of the start of the dirty habit or poisonous thought, but when it grows up and becomes strong, it becomes almost impossible to get rid of it.</p>
<p class="Text"> Progress depends upon our ownselves. Noble thought, good habits, or auspicious resolves are under our power. When the divine properties become silent, only then the wicked demoniac characters become active. The demoniac characters remain asleep in our mind or in other words, the divine tendencies present in our mind remain alert and awakened and keep them suppressed. The divine traits keep on the poisonous demons subdued and powerless. If we want the real joy or happiness and peace, we should maintain the divine characters as—love, pity, sympathy, service, sacrifice, modesty etc., always active, awakened and progressive. If the pious instincts or the gods, asleep in the world of your mind, remain always awakened and constant active in doing their divine acts, the demoniac characters will not get opportunity to grow up and the man will continue going ahead on the splendid path. By adopting the good resolve to activate it in practice is in our hands. If we are always alert and choose only good habits using our wisdom, we can make a good progress. We can shape our character according to our wish. The power of pious resolve is hidden in human being in natural way. The divine power is there in you by nature. We can expand it as much as we want by distinguhing it and constant practice.</p>
<p class="Text">By the practice of divine powers, develop them, mind it that your efficiency develops by practice day by day. If your divine powers are not used , they begin to decay. The cause of every action is thought. We are the undisputed lord of our mental empire.</p>
<p class="Text">The mental empire is also what a strange! There are strange imaginations in it and there are a lot of seen or unseen or heard matters of the world. In this empire there is no reach of any one else but you. This is such an empire where there is no motion of any grossness. This empire is situated in zero and that zero is not the zero of practical mathematics but shapeless. Even the air has no reach there.</p>
<p class="Text">In your mental, imaginary state you are completely free and you, yourself are the maker of all the rules. You are all in all. You can make impossible to possible. This is your such a hidden empire which is beyond the right of anyone and beyond the knowledge of anyone and neither there can be raised any objection by anyone against your thoughts.</p>
<p class="Text">Keep in mind, difficulties and comforts, success and failure, gain and loss, progress and downfall—all reflect in your life only according to your mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Never be disappointed, Remain always making efforts constantly for your progress, for the creation of noble habits, for the accomplishment of your good resolves, By making efforts again and again you will be encouraged and get success. Your hard and difficult works will become easier gradually. Your each and every effort, even your a little success is to enhance your spiritual power and self confidence. In future you will be able to do your work smiling. In the life it is the most necessary to go on making efforts remaining always alert for the accomplishment of auspicious resolves. This self-confidence is needed not only for the youths but for the old also.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Success is a habit</p>
<p class="Text">Success is a habit. Form the habit of success from the very childhood. Man’s mind is the repository of such powers which cannot be imagined by man himself. Napoleon Bonapart was considered the most powerful man of the world. He was a fearless and bold leader. It was his heroic and most courageous deed, that has made his name immortal in the history of the world, but when we see his life in the beginning, we are amazed how Napoleon could make so much progress.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Was he the son of any rich capatalist?’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Not at all. He was born in a poor family in an island; named Korsika.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Were the facilities of education and life available to him?’</p>
<p class="Text">‘No, the poor Napoleon was deprived of any arrangement of education.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Did he pass his childhood in comforts and grandeurous?’</p>
<p class="Text">‘No, his childhood was full of darkness. He was considered the boy of dull-mind since his childhood. In the beginning of life his health was also not satisfactory. Besides it, he was physically very weak, lean and thin.’</p>
<p class="Text">In spite of so many difficulties, miseries and oppositions, Napoleon had reached the top of success with the support of self-confidence, strong resolution and willpower. Despite his poverty and a little education, he became the ruler of France. This ruler was quite opposite to the Napoleon of childhood. Napoleon raised to the position of the commander of France army from a common soldier of the army. Having defeated the Europian countries he assimilated them in his ruling state. The cause behind his wonderful progress was his self-confidence. He always used to think in the kingdom of his mind that he was a brave man of the world. From the very childhood, the feeling of heroism and greatness had rooted in his mind. It was his version that with the support of firm resolve nothing is impossible in the world. From the early childhood he dreamt in his mind to rule the whole world.</p>
<p class="Text">You, too, should always have the dauntless faith in your confidence of greatness. Man is empowered with such a wonderful stock of power which is beyond the imagination of himself.</p>
<p class="Text">Because of being the domination of mind this body is named as ‘man’. The persons of developed mind should be called man. Everyone has the impact of mind in one’s life. Only due to his thoughts a man falls into the bondage or salvation. By the mental concentration to a single purpose, the energy is created. So, as are the thoughts, meditation and contemplation of mind, so will be our will power.</p>
<p class="Text">If your thoughts are lower graded, confined to the momentary enjoyments of sensuousness, sports, recreation and tours, the energy will also be likewise. How can they move ahead whose thoughts change from moment to moment?</p>
<p class="Text">You are not a feeble body but a spirit of supreme power. Where the thoughts are firm and doubtless, there is the unlimited and strong power. The steadiness and resolution in thought comes from faith.</p>
<p class="Text">Just consider, who are you? Are you simply a body? Are you an effigy made of bones, flesh, blood, skin etc., foul smelling and hateful objects? No, you are nothing like bone, flesh blood, you are the form of divinity. When anyone slaps on your body, you say ‘he beat me’. You, here, commit mistake. If you think seriously, you will come to realise that you are not simply a body, but thought yourself, you are yourself power, you are verily what as you think yourself. If you understand merely a body, then, you are simply a body. If you consider yourself a soul, great soul, developed, greater and supreme soul, the omnipotent spirit then, really you are omnipotent, endowed with all the virtues, a great warrior, full of patience, valorous outstanding man. You are the divine image. You can become whatever you like by your firm resolve.</p>
<p class="Text">You have the born natural right to become vigorous, strong, healthy lustrous. Never say that you are agonised, helpless, poor, old, sick, empty of energy and suffering from fever. These are the external matters, related to body only.</p>
<p class="Text">You are superior to body,—You are intellect, greater than intellect you are soul. You are the hero of the divine force. You are the lord of all. Have your mind under full control. Make it strong. The body will also obey the mind. Then, there will be no trace of sorrow, worry, weakness, old age or failure. Give up the feeling of infirmity. Wake up in the light of knowledge from the darkness of illusion.</p>
<p class="Text">This ‘if and but’. ‘If it had been so, I would have also made progress.’ ‘If I had favour of anyone, I would have been promoted ....... but it was not so.’ Qualification and worth have no meaning’, never talk such sentences of cowards. These words make you weak and feeble. Never allow room to sorrow, remorse, disease, pain, loss and disappointment, infirmity and misery in your mind and heart. It makes you lax, your rights are devastated and there comes the mentality of slavery in you.</p>
<p class="Text">Don’t make the public-slander a hurdle in the accomplishment of a higher goal. This thought checks you from the progress. It fetters your legs. ‘People will laugh, cut remark, public will ridicule, they will condemn’, don’t care for it. The path of progress is difficult and very hard and unbearable. It does not suit the world. The people of the world remain jealous of them who are making progress. If you care for the worthless matters of the world, having fallen into the pit of disappointment forever, you will always remain decaying in the same down condition. You will not be able to see the broad world coming out of the narrow well being the frog in the well. Such thoughts of weakness occur in the mind to test the power of resolution. So, without being deviated by such thoughts, testify your firmity. Don’t show your incapability. By firm resoluton, self-confidence and constant practice, even the impossible will become possible. Remain proceeding ahead having firm faith in God’s grace and spiritual force.</p>
<p class="Text">Don’t allow the soul to be disgraced, let not the spirit be disregarded. Let not the eternal illumination of the spiritual lamp be dim.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-35">The noble thoughts have the power of new creations</p>
<p class="Text">Noble thoughts are the originator of man’s hidden mind, his present life and bright future. The desires lying in the hidden mind, our flights of imagination are fulfilled inevitably.</p>
<p class="Text">Contrary to it, the inferiority complex, worry, fear and disappointing thoughts decay our productive energy. The present life becomes hell. It results in suicides and heart-attacks. In spite of being alive the man lives like a dead man.</p>
<p class="Text">The common men lack the knowledge of what is the gain or loss of high pure thoughts and specially the uneducated persons are unaware of this fact at all. That is why in this world a numberless persons feel disturbance and problems in life.</p>
<p class="Text">If the people become aware of the way to have the pious thoughts and they begin to think in the positive direction, this world appearing so hard and full of problems, will become the heaven of joys. Wailing, remorse, worry, perplexity, fear, misery disappointment etc., mental feelings will be nowhere and the man will become the owner of the entire happiness and prosperity of the Lord, the creator.</p>
<p class="Text">Thought is the creative power. The sublime inclination and right way of thinking are the names of noble thought. This high thinking, the noble thought of self-welfare is the base of the future progress.</p>
<p class="Text">The thought even being invisible is everything. That is the best part of man’s mind. That is all valuable mental property. ‘Thought’ is not worthless at all, that is denomination, creative power, the form of progress. There lies the creative life. That is in itself life. That is the truth.</p>
<p class="Text">Thought is the original form of man. Whatever the repercussion is created, the form is shaped, the impression is felt by throwing stone, wood etc., in the water, there is more severe hurt made by throwing the thoughts through speech (speech-writing). The firm sublime thoughts create the better atmosphere. Whosoever comes in its surroundings, does not remain unaffected.</p>
<p class="Text">Thoughts have wonderful power to create new life,  to form the new society and originate the new world. When the society adopts the new thoughts, the new generation starts pulling on life accordingly. One whose mind is full of zeal for the new and there lies the acute ambition in his mind to become great in life, one who wants to become a high officer, an eminent writer or a famous orator or leader, whose mind remains always creating big objects, high ideals in the void, in his state of mind, really, becomes great one day with the power of his thoughts—This is the experience of all the considerate and reasoning persons. All of them who have attained a very high position, rising from the ground or who have earned an immortal name, have given the priorty to the progressive sublime thoughts in every work.</p>
<p class="Text">The quote of a great learned man, Saloman is true to a great extent. He says that—‘As lasting emotions a man keeps in his mind, as he thinks in his mind, he becomes so gradually. Every thought forms the minute centres of his mind.’</p>
<p class="Text">But there is a misuse also of this power of thought. That is to remain engaged in worthless imaginations like a fool and never to do any solid work. By assuming air and sitting idle, none can make uplift. What is thought must be practised. Prove a true and pure gold in your action. There should be truth of resolution in your speech. There should be the background of action. The hands and legs both should be used together. The body should remain active.</p>
<p class="Text">The power of creation lies only in those thoughts where there is true faith, strong devotion and constant practice.</p>
<p class="Text">It is truly written in Bible—‘According to your faith, do it into you..’ So, it is clear that the power of life-creation lies only in high active thoughts.</p>
<p class="Text">Besides the pure and high thoughts a firm faith is needed. If a student’s mind is always bent upon doing the professional job, he will be an employee only in his later life, but if in any high ambitious mind, there are the grand thoughts of doing superior acts of benevolence, due to the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings and resolute thoughts certainly he will be the master of any excellent action in future and rule over numbers of men.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The patients recovered by sublime thoughts</p>
<p class="Text">There was a report in a Newspaper that a mental doctor cured more than two hundred patients by the awakening of the noble thoughts in their minds.</p>
<p class="Text">Its secret is that to any patient or anybody as the thoughts and sermons are preached again and again with firmness, the same thoughts will be started to be practised by the patient with his body through his secret mind. The meritorious thoughts of health, joy, courage, prowess, vigour, happiness etc., were readout again and again to the mentally weak patients. So, their mind giving up the thoughts of disease and weakness heard and adopted the beneficial thoughts of health, pleasure, happiness etc. As a result, they began to feel themselves healthy and strong. As much gradually they attained health, happiness and energy.</p>
<p class="Text">Just mark, what a wonderful influence of right and healthy thoughts is!</p>
<p class="Text">This is the spell of the thoughts of a common category. When you make the strong practice of the reasoning science, you will realise the truth of thoughts and you will confirm it that really, it is the ‘thought’ only the most creative fertilising energy of man.</p>
<p class="Text">Even, by our mutual association the great purpose of ideas is achieved. They who are of pleasant and happy nature, are always happy, never worry; even in the miseries and hardships they remain absorbed in the lofty thoughts only and passs the time smiling. Anyone who meets him, how much sad, worried, distressed and troubled he might be, becomes pleased to see their smiling face. He forgets his agony and pain and becomes sharer of their pleasant company. Whenever, the men of joyous thoughts go, they rain the happiness and delightfulness everywhere.</p>
<p class="Text">Just contrary to it, there are such men also whose face is always swelled on account of anger, jealousy, deceit or agitation. Their face is ugly and they remain always surrounded with sad, bitter and poisonous atmosphere. Nobody wants to go to them and neither anyone wants to talk to them. Their faces remain faded due to their poisonous mentality only. They are source of disease, sorrow, grief everywhere.</p>
<p class="Text">There is the need of such men in the world whose heart is pious, sacrificing and full of love and who are the source of happiness to all, who may expand the empire of love, happiness and exhilarations in the society of the distressed and agonised persons.</p>
<p class="Text">The storage of the Supreme Lord is inside you, then why do you beg the alms of love, delight and happiness from others outside? Why do you become the beggar for man’s support?</p>
<p class="Text">In the boundless storage of the Supreme all the objects belong to Him, then why don’t you demand directly from Him? Why don’t you have faith in His power of making gifts?</p>
<p class="Text">The reason is that you were not educated since the childhood about the supremacy of the Lord and you have also started doing so imitating the weak and lethargic men of the world.</p>
<p class="Text">You have a great need of self-confidence. That self-confidence is the existence of God in you.</p>
<p class="Text">You will question, ‘Will the God bestow unexpectedly a large fortune?’ My answer is, ‘Yes, would give you’ Give place to self-faith in your mind.’</p>
<p class="Text">For the sake of example there are several such examples, but better you test by doing yourself. Mind again the following verse of the Gita 17/3—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्य श्रद्धा भवति भारत। </p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रद्धामयोऽयं पुरुषो यो यच्छ्रद्ध: स एव स:॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘O Arjuna! The faith of all men conforms to their mental disposition. Faith constitutes a man; whatever  the nature of his faith, verily he is that.’</p>
<p class="Text">And in the Bible there are many references at different places—‘If you demand in My name, then, believe, you will get and do realise this also that you got it. You will get certainly.’</p>
<p class="Text">But it is a matter of sorrow that we don’t awaken our spiritual force, don’t have full faith in our spiritual force, that is why we are agonised.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Think in the right direction</p>
<p class="Text">Several books have already been written on the power of thought and more others are in the process, but it seems that nothing has been written till now. We see that everyone is in the possession of that power but they are not making the best use of it as they ought to do. This is called—‘It is darkness under the lamp’.</p>
<p class="Text">Place your highest ideals, outstanding dreams, flourishing thoughts in your mind keep these ideals safe. Try to practise them in your daily life and daily works, apparently. If you are of firm determination on your beautiful thoughts, your future life will be shaped accordinly.</p>
<p class="Text">Healthy mind-creative, useful and self-supporting thoughtful mind is the architect of your life. The new directions of the progressive life are formed only by healthy and better mind and the body bears the fruits of good and bad works also due to mind. Throw out the feelings of defeat, timidity, inferiority, and worry from your mind. Don’t be afraid of defeat. Every defeat should create a new energy in you. The defeat should create new zeal and courage in you. The useful defeat means that circulates the new potency and the elixir of courage in you and makes the path easy for the victory.</p>
<p class="Text">But don’t try to complete all in hurry in a single day. Do your work with peaceful and balanced mind slowly and slowly. Your courage should be maintained constantly. In any condition that should not be loose. First, think over well that you are a developed soul and a man of prowess. You are fully capable to accomplish the work. You are the embodiment of victory. Make such thoughts the part and parcel of your nature. After some time, all your uphill tasks will become easy for you in the natural way.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Make your resolves strong. This firmity is the base foundation of your accomplishment. As you sow, so shall you reap. According to the men of prowess if the work is done with firmity, victory is a must. Let your hidden potency go on increasing. If you are not successful, don’t blame the nature of situations or anyone else unnecessarily.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-36">Have faith, the future is ready to welcome you with golden days</p>
<p class="Text">Probably, you have already made up your mind, that the golden days of your life have passed away and the highest achievements to be achieved have been achieved by you.</p>
<p class="Text">This is a false notion. Having abandoned it, adopt the new optimistic view.</p>
<p class="Text">Human life is very long. Everyday and every moment a new success is achieved. Any invisible hand inspires at every moment for a new progress.</p>
<p class="Text">Life is like a big book of which every page goes on opening gradually. God knows! What its expansion is! How long will it go? How long is its destination!</p>
<p class="Text">Listen to an event of a day. I was sitting in the Post Office. At the same time an young man of thirty to thirty-five years came there to withdraw his deposited amount from his saving account. His face was faded with worry, sadness and a great disappointment. His face was growing pale.</p>
<p class="Text">By the way, the discussion started. I asked in amazement, ‘Why brother! Why are you closing your account?’ He turned his faded face towards me. He said with disappointed eyes, ‘Doctor Sahib! What to say! I am entangled with miseries!’ I said—‘Are you entangled in any court case?’</p>
<p class="Text">He said—‘Brother! I did not see even the face of the court throughout my life. Here, I have another problem.’</p>
<p class="Text">I was astonished. Different types of arguments were arising in my mind. He, himself began to narrate his story.</p>
<p class="Text">He said—‘I have been consulting the doctors since the last year and seeking their advice. Sometimes I have stomach-ache and always feel heaviness in my stomach. I consulted many doctors; but the last doctor gave his finding that I had developed a disease, named appendicitis. The last portion of my intestine has decayed. That is the cause of the heaviness, old constipation and pain. Through operation that portion will be cut down and separated. I have been postponing this operation for one year. Now, the doctor advises for immediate operation, otherwise death is inevitable. My wife and children are too much disturbed. Hence, I want to handover the amount remaining with me in the deposit and then, I should be ready for the peaceful death.’ While saying this, tear came in the eyes of the youth. I was also shocked for a moment. Then, I said, ‘Have you consulted any other doctor also?’</p>
<p class="Text">He said—‘I have already consulted the most expert doctors also. I have no faith in the common Vaidyas. The medical Science is so advanced and therefore, there is no scope of doubt.’</p>
<p class="Text">I—‘Do you have faith in God and Naturopathy?’</p>
<p class="Text">He—‘No, I believe in only what can be proved by logic and which may satisfy my mind and wisdom.’</p>
<p class="Text">I—‘For the God’s sake, postpone your operation for the next few days and let me treat you for a week. When ultimately, you have to die, enjoy the light and air of the world for a week more.’</p>
<p class="Text">He was impressed to some extent. I said to him, ‘Soul is closely related to God. So, you are free from any disorder, accept it. Unnatural way of living and polluted view of an atheist, has made you to consider that this God-gifted body as the storage of diseases.</p>
<p class="Text">“Now, get up early in the morning and concentrate your mind to the changeless, free from vices and disease, pure, immutable, the eternal Supreme Lord. Say to yourself—‘I am completely well and healthy. There is no trace of any polluted flaw. The divine spirit is getting awakened in me and it is getting me rid of all the disorders. My entire body is quite healthy, free from any disease. I have no contact with any disease. I am a man of pure and changeless body. I am healthy. My stomach is doing the function of digestion properly. All the accumulated flaws have been removed away.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘This was the mental treatment. It will revive your lost self-confidence and wonderful miracle of Divine Power will come out in your bdoy?’</p>
<p class="Text">“The next number is of Naturopathy. You are a clerk. You work for eight to ten hours sitting in the chair, bending down your waist. So, you are suffering from the acute constipation. Drink double water. Take maximum fruit juice and make the fruits your regular diet; eat the tomato and mango by sucking it. The last advice is that you should walk daily in the morning for two hours without any break. Do the manual work. Well! The body will be completely transformed.”</p>
<p class="Text">The spiritual treatment had such an effect and by the grace of the God that gentleman began to recover. Within a week the heaviness of his stomach reduced. The use of Anima was also continued to clear the stomach. Now his health is more than satisfactory. He has got a new life and his doubt of appendicities has also been removed from his mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Now he has become theist in his view also. He has developed his full faith in the prayer of God and water-treatment. I usually advise him even today—‘The best time and the best success of your life is still waiting to welcome you in future.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">He usually answers—‘I have experienced the power of God and got the healthy life. Is it not enough! The power which could not be convinced by anyone has come out by devotion.’ Sometimes, that which we have already considered the end of life becomes the beginning of success. So, we should never be disappointed.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-37">The imperishable treasure of spiritual power </p>
<p class="Text-Black">Spiritual Power</p>
<p class="Text">When you see the laughing-tittling fragment flowers on any charming juicy branch, a longing rises in your heart—‘How good it would have been that I would have also been simple, charming and attractive and innocent like them! I would have also been so colourful like them and fragrant with the scent of virtues; I would also have been innocent and affectionate; I would have also led a carefree bereft of showy life!’</p>
<p class="Text">When you see the bright sparking colours of a peacock’s feathers and find him in the oblivious condition completely absorbed in dance, abruptly desirous you became that—‘Would that I could also dance in such an attractive manner and could attract others fascination, the movement of my feet could express out the profound feelings of my heart. The sweet and touching songs of my heart could express my joys and sorrows, hatred and love, hopes and disappointments etc.!’</p>
<p class="Text">When we read the most touching stanzas of any devotional poet or poetess, or hear the devotional songs there is created a forceful desire in our heart involuntarily, ‘If I could also sing the sweet songs and compose the touching devotional song and would express my mental conflicts in the devotional voice! By the queer mixture of devotion and poetry, I could feel the spiritual joy and with the union of self-devotion, my life would be auspicious and peaceful! The people could feel fresh, with the cultural awakenning in my speech!</p>
<p class="Text">When we hear the highly developed moral tendency of Prahlad, Dhruv etc., the virtuous morality of moral and chaste women, the sacrifice of Dadhichi for the protection of divinity, the valiant stories of the martyrs to free the country from slavery, the firmity and courage of brave Hakikatrai, the heroic and fearless inspiring occurences of Guru Govind Singh’s sons, the intense desire is created in our mind and heart that—‘Would that I could also expose these high morals and merits, these characteristics, these ideals and high emotions in my life! I would also sacrifice my life on these altar of freedom!’</p>
<p class="Text">Wherever we see the high conducts and merits, health, charm or any praiseworthy art or skill, in any other one, a high intense ideal sentiment and feeling is created in ourself silently from unknown source, ‘Would to heaven that I could also demonstrate the same divine feeling or outstanding powers!’ Every goodness creates an awakenning in us, wakes up our latent spiritual potency and gives a secret indication to go a head towards higher. It is our hidden spiritual power that creates interest and courage towards goodness and superiority. The temptation and desire of our heart towards the noble qualities and virtues of others and to imitate them is only due to this storage of our potential spiritual power.</p>
<p class="Text">On the other side there is an other concept.</p>
<p class="Text">When you see any mad making delirious talk, wrapped in odd and filthy cloths, speaking meaningless, there is never a desire in you that ‘I, too, should become foolish, intoxicated and unbalanced like him.’ When you see any thief, robber, or criminal being convicted or being outcasted in the society, you never want at all to become a thief robber or criminal. When we see any leper, crippled, sick, feeble, poor, destitute, defamed, outcasted, convict our mind never tempts us to become so. To see an ugly man we never long to be ugly ourselves. To see a patient we never desire to become a patient.</p>
<p class="Text">We don’t want to become the tormentor of subjects or dictator like Kans. We have no sympathy at all for Ravan, the kidnapper of Sita and inclined towards tyrany and torture. We have no affection for wicked Duryodhan who tortured his brothers and got butchered the numberless men. We hate the wickeds, immorals, the oppressors of subjects, brutals, killers of mankind, annihilators, exploitors, drinkers, gamblers and lustful persons. We never want to become anyone of them. All the evil tendencies are against our spirit. Our natural attitude is never inclined towards them.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">We proceed only towards the virtues, morality, noble tendency, high arts and scripts and divine qualities of Divinity. Our self-spirit is the nectar basin of all the divine qualities. That is such a divine centre, where our high ideal tendencies and feelings go on sparking like the sparks of fire. The green trees are seen flourishing on the spots where the water is hidden underground. In the same way where the spiritual truth of mankind is awakened, our mentality and tendency remains attracted towards the divine qualities of soul. That proceeds ahead towards divinity. The spiritual truth loves the virtues and all the dignities. In splendour and glory of the society it is our spiritual truth only that is circulating. The root centre of glory, supreme and beauty is our own spirit the embodiment of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-38">What will you collect, poison or honey?</p>
<p class="Text">In the earth, sky, light, air, soil, potency—all are equally available to all, but the sugarcane taking out the living element from the earth and collecting the quality of sweetness, provides us sugar, jaggery, relish and sweet-meat; lemon orange, tomato, tamarind, ginger collect sourness; the bitter gourd collects the bitter element; the chilli pungent, the ginger becomes acrid. are generated from the same earth according to the seeds. Every seed takes out the living element from the earth according to its nature and character and actions. Despite the equality of the earth, water, air, sky to all there is distinction in the new objects. The same is the condition of mankind living in the human world.</p>
<p class="Text">For all the human beings world is the same. It has plenty of prosperity action, honour, repute, pleasure, health, life-element, property lying scattered. For all, but everyone is collecting joy and sorrow according to his natural disposition and mentality. There are so many enjoying the happiness of life and so many are suffering the tortures of hell. We make our own separate world ourselves according to our mentality, interest, nature, character, action and our view of life.</p>
<p class="Text">The fancy of heaven and hell always revolves in human mind, they cannot be fulfilled in the outer world; they are created according to the individual thoughts and action in this very world. There might be heaven or hell, but here in this world, we are ourselves creator of the joys of heaven or tortures of hell for our life.</p>
<p class="Text">You will be astonished how a man can enjoy heaven? Heaven is the invaluable creation of the Supreme Lord. How can a human being share his hand there? Man is a feeble effigy of flesh and bones; what can be possible for him?</p>
<p class="Text">But such doubts are useless. In the creation of our world we are more responsible. Our mind is busy in weaving the warp and woof of heaven and hell. We can attain the salvation, supreme bliss and supreme abode not after death but in this very world, in this life by this human body when we are alive. It is the mind that changes the heaven into hell and just when our view changes by illuminating the hell with divine light our mind changes it into heaven.</p>
<p class="Text">You will ask, ‘How is heaven possible on the earth?’ Where is capability in us to do so? It is the vicissitudes of fortune that does everything. Who can drive the chariot of fate?</p>
<p class="Text">The first way to create the heaven on the earth is—healthy body. Body is that insturment through which you take out the subtle particle of heaven and hell from the earth. The sick, feeble, weak, loose, devoid of valour, filthy body is such a defective instrument that can take out only disappointment, jealousy, anger, hosility, sexual passion, bitterness, malice from the earth. That element contains only to take out filth merely and to create the atmosphere accordingly. The sick body has the sick mind. What will a sick mind create except hell? The prurient body will think of only fornication, the greedy mind will run only after money. The angry mind will collect the aids of its agitation itself. The jealous mind will collect itself the materials of its sorrow and vexation. This world will appear to sick body as a shackled, full of sorrow and difficulties, internal agony, opposite to it, he whose body is healthy and sound, finds the world as heaven.</p>
<p class="Text">The second element is—Man’s view towards life. The man who has the pessimistic view about life, will get nothing except difficulties, disappointment failure; what more will he get? He will get the sources of wailing and lamentation anywhere. Such men are habitual of sorrow. This will create the mental hell. Against it, the optimistic person will any how and anywhere find out the support of living a happy life and a courageous life. From mental point of view, the optimistic and pessimistic view is the creator of heaven and hell. What is the colour in our mind, the surroundings and everywhere looks accordingly. The reflection of our inner mind creates the happiness and sorrow in this world.</p>
<p class="Text">If we want, we can create in the inner side or outer side both the atmosphere of love joy and courage with the higher counsels, we can make the surrounding atmosphere fragrant with the fragrance of heaven by our pious thoughts and feelings. Contrary to it we can make our innerside and outerside both as hell by the vicious desires.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Whether you will collect poison like a scorpion or honey like a honey-bee?<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-39">Be optimistic in your view</p>
<p class="Text">The worried or a happy life depends on our outlook and view of life. Actually, ‘What is our point of view regarding any event’—This element creates our mental world. If you take your life with happy, exhilarating and optimistic point of view, it is certain that in spite of distressed mind, you will lead a happy and optimistic life. The man concentrated to his tragic events of life will be facing the sorrow and agony only despite his sound and healthy atmosphere.</p>
<p class="Text">For example, go through the life of the men of mean mentality as mentioned by Sri Anant Gopal Seware—</p>
<p class="Text">It is in our hand to accept the calamity as calamity or not. There are some such events, to break out fire in the house, or the death of any dear one, bankruptcy, to loose the case, long sickness, imprisonment, daughter’s marriage, son’s education etc., undoubtedly cause us trouble to some extent but we begin to consider it so seriously and excessively as if the mountain on our head and think that the great calamity has fallen on us. There is no lack of persons in our society who consider the rope as a snake and start trembling. One of my friends was in jail who had been sentenced to jail for one and half years. He counted the days daily that when he would be released.’ I said—‘O brother! Now it is remaining only one year in place of one and half years. What time will it take to pass on?’ Under the walls of prison, there are some who see either the mud of the ground or walls of the jail only and there are some who make themselves joyous to stare the stars of the sky?</p>
<p class="Text">When I was in the boarding, I used to purchase the objects of need sharing it with my room partner. When the bottle of the scented oil remained half empty, he said—‘Just see, how fast is this oil of half of this bottle finished in twenty days only?’</p>
<p class="Text">‘O dear, how is it empty? Still it is half full.’ I said.</p>
<p class="Text">Ponder over seriously on the above examples. Difference of views is clearly visible in it. The writer’s smiling face and encouraging others is optimism where he looks only the merits in others and takes inspiration from them. The second is the pessimistic view where he has made himself half dead due to the great disease of worry, in spite of everything with him. As long days you will remain half dead in the worry of false fear, in so long days, the optimist with his happy appearance will gather so much power and means that the mishappenings will not be effective on him. What a matter of sorrow it is that we don’t change our wrong and poor outlook? We should have the outlook of hope, courage, joy, and self-interest.</p>
<p class="Text">Sir Walter Scatt’s example is inspiring to us. To run a Press Sir Walter Scott had been loaded with such a heavy loan that a man of common moral strength would have gone mad due to the heavy load on mind but Sir Walter Scott did not allow his mental condition to be deviated and continuously for forty years he went on writing novels and cleared off the entire loan by its earning.</p>
<p class="Text">Lowal Thomas also had to face the problem of loan, he got fierce disappointments, but in spite of all he had never felt worried. He knew that if he got worried about his loans, his productive and creative efficiency would be crippled and his money-lenders would surround him and start buzzing on him like buzzing bees. So, daily in the morning he bought one flower and linking it to the button of his coat, singing the melodious song set out to walk towards the Oxford street. He always kept the feelings of fearlessness, vigour and optimism in his mind and never accepted defeat even in adverse situations. He remained always alert in making efforts to find out any way to make the circumstances in his favour.</p>
<p class="Text">How the change of outlook or view influences the mind to be strong or weak will be clear to you through this example of the book ‘The Psychology of Strength’ (Shakti Ka Manovigyan) written by J. A. Hadfield. He writes—‘I have tested three men’s strength in the influence of mental suggestion. That strength test was made by catching the Dynamo Metre. I instructed them to hold the Dynamo Metre strongly and tested their physical strength in three different situations of mind.’</p>
<p class="Text">When I tested them while working in commonly average condition their average strength to hold it was 101 pound and again they were indicated by mental suggestion that they had grown weak. The sign of weakness was growing in them. This indication had such a fatal impact on them that their energy reduced to 29 pound. Thus, they were given the solid indications of their loss of strength, weakness, decayed vitality again and again by hypnotism. As a result, they became so weak that one of them happened to say that he had no strength even equal to a child. I am a child without energy. My all the limbs of the body have gone lax.</p>
<p class="Text">Then, again having put these men under creative and solid clues their physical strength was tested. ‘You are strong, you are vigorous.’ There cues had such a forceful impact that their strength increased to 142 pound. By the encouraging cues, five hundred percent of increase has been found in their physical strength. This above mentioned example makes it crystal clear how much effective the view of mind is.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, a sick man lying on a bedstead was brought before Christ, the great. Christ’s mental point of view was always full of exhilaration, strength and optimism. He said to the sick man, ‘Son! Be happy ...... your sins will be forgiven by the Lord ...... Stand up and go home on foot.’ By this cue of firmly and self confidence, there was such a wonderful impact on that sick man that really he stood and began to walk. It was the statement of the sick man that ‘These courageous and inspiring words had such a miracle on him as if there was the overflow of the powerful energy in his innerself.’</p>
<p class="Text">Del Karnegi is of the opinion that man can be completely free from worry, fear and different types of other many diseases by the support of optimistic courageous views. He should develop love for life. He should get absorbed in the well-wishing emotions to throw away the causes of worries with the support of sympathy.</p>
<p class="Text">D. Larson’s statement is that the new psyche specialists have made the research that there are little objects in our life which have more impact on our mind and body than happiness. Spirit, body and mind all are balanced to joy. Thousands of men have been ruined in absence of happy mentality. So, for the long life, pleasure and health, worry is dangerous. </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">The body demands happiness, hope, exhilaration and peace. In want of necessary substance the spirit is pained. We should fulfil the demand of body by remaining happy and exhilarated always.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-40">Died in the age of thirty, buried at sixty</p>
<p class="Text">It should be inscribed on the graves of most of the persons dying nowadays. ‘Died in the age of thirty but buried at sixty.’ Why? There are many persons in my notice who start declaring themselves old even in their youthful age of thirty. Life is the name of cheerfulness and their cheerfulness perishes to dust from their very childhood. The sweet feelings of enthusiasm, carefreeness delight, dreams and the sweet and pleasant imaginations of youthfulness have taken plight from their hearts forever. Life has become dim, tasteless, momentry and transient for them. Just pay attention to the following sentences of the letter written by a modern youth and then you will come to know what is their attitude towards life—</p>
<p class="Text">‘.....Sometimes I remember the room of the boarding, when I used to be with you, when there was a spring in our movements, picnics and day-to-day life. Then, life was like an intoxicating object and we could be more intoxicated and infatuated, carefree and absorbed in it. When there felt a great delight in the gossip with the friends and in the presentation of minds minute motion. Now, it seems that the feeling of satisfaction and contentment has destroyed the sharpness of mind and body. I am not in any trouble but rather comfortable. My desires are fulfilled before I express. Yet I am lacking that joy of those days. A strange laziness has overpowered. Like watch I am going on counting the hours and minutes of life. To talk with you about the unworried carefree old days; not in the present and future, bathing in the past I want to become again young and joyous for sometime.....’</p>
<p class="Text">Such a condition of apathy, helplessness, disappointment and inefficiency is not only of my this friend but of thousands of others. God knows why the people are not hopeful and optimistic about life. Today we see that many a man becomes old and weak untimely earlier in life and become the prey of untimely death. By decreasing slowly and slowly a man’s age has reduced to thirty to thirty-five. This concept has prevailed among us that this is our real age. The miserable result of this rooted illusionary feeling is that to see anyone in the old age, in our mind also the same idea is created that I will also reach the same position very soon. My cheeks will also be shrivelled, the eye-sight will be weak, the body will be in a deplorable and helpless condition and then one day ...d...ea...th. Enough, being afraid of this idea we have the assumption of different baseless fears. We always remain absorbed in the hearti rending and painful feelings of old age. It is not known what the more we think, and in the same worry remaining absorbed we come to invite that great monster too earlier than matured time who has chewed away I don’t know, how many.</p>
<p class="Text">Keep in mind—To think of diseases and other adverse results, we corrupt our mind and provide a suitable place for them in our body, and then the disease makes its claim in our body. To be fully overpowered by the imaginary fear of old age and always dreaming the old age and burning in the fire of old age, we invite of making the favourable circumstances and situation. The moment, the imagination of any wicked thought, disasterous disease or any other miserable imagination comes to our mind, at once its image or photo is printed in our mind. Then, the same disease, the same worry the same wicked imagination makes a very bad effect in the form of any serious and dreadful disease on our body. With the same types of unhealthy and disappointing thoughts we damage our fate with our own hands. We ourselves cover the moon light of happiness and health with black clouds.</p>
<p class="Text">William Lyan Philips asserts—‘I can tell you the exact time when the man starts growing old. That is the moment when he feels after self-examination that while sitting aloof his mind and thought is attracted towards the past more than future. When man’s mind remains stored with the old happening, the old memories, reminiscence and the past events, understand that he is growing old.’</p>
<p class="Text">After passing many years and facing many adversities in search of the way out to get rid of the feelings of old age, I suddenly came to know that always remaining worried about it, cannot give me success to get it. To cut short a long story is that we should not allow our mind to think even for a moment that we are growing old, we are ill, or weak. Forget your age completely, don’t pay your attention towards it at all. Never think of them. Not of only yours but don’t allow your mind to give entry to the thought of others decaying age also. Make a firm resolve in your mind that you will not be old still. But reverse to it form a habit of dreaming the happy youthfulness. Enter into it with the high ideals of youth and until your each particle is overwhelmed with those divine emotions, don’t separate those divine ideals even to the size of mole hill from your innerself. As will be our ideals, so will be our ambitions, and as will be our feelings of heart, so will be their glimpse visible on our face and the reflection of the same will twinkle in our eyes. We should be fully confident and well determined that we have no concern at all with impotency, lazinesss, diseases, disappointment, mental and physical agony and death.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">If we continue the spontaneous divine flow of youthfulness and having the ideals of youth infront, having faith in our potency for them make efforts and always keep the rules of health and energy before us and throwout the worry, fear and doubt from our mental ambit, the old age will remain afraid of us. Let the courage shower on the grass of youthfulness that has grown in your heart. Follow the rules of conduct with pure celibacy. Keep it in your mind that the presumption of time of the old age to start and loosing potency has caused a great loss to the human society. Whatever such types of grass and straw have established their roots in our mental garden, should be started to be rooted out from just now. Man never grows old, but he, himself, feels old. You cannot be old so long as there is the dominance of sweetness, modesty, and courage in your mind and heart, so long as your heart remains illuminated with the divine light of ambition, so long as the fear of old age is not created in your mind, so long as there is the flow of potency in your blood to work and your physical strength is not lost. Build a grand building of pleasure and happiness in your heart with these joy giving potencies.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-41">We should pass our life smiling like the flowers</p>
<p class="Text">There are three works on priority in human life—work, recreation and rest. Everyone of the common people takes at least eight hours compulsory out of twenty-four hours of day and night to earn his livlihood. After taking out eight hours for rest, eight hours time is remaining for leisure. This is a problem of consideration how to use these eight hours of leisure period to get maximum delight, pleasure and peace.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Evade always shedding tears</p>
<p class="Text">This is the version of numerous men that—‘I have no time for recreation and to enjoy the charms of life. I am surrounded with so many problems that I always remain entangled with them day and night and thus, I am very much disturbed.’ This is uttered by him in such an anguished mood that it indicates his helplessness, disappointment and incapability.</p>
<p class="Text">You ask the ladies—‘What do you do the whole day?’ They will say—‘In baking the bread, looking after the children, fulfilling all the domestic chores, sweeping the house, cleaning the utensils, washing the clothes, preparing the children for school and sewing the clothes, I remain so busy that I have no time for rest.’ While saying so their face will become withered with worry, disappointment, pain and internal agony. They are as if weeping, their appearance will cause you to presume that they are passing their life in wail and cry. The load of the worldly worries is so heavy on them that they are doing nothing except wailing-crying and bearing the heavy useless burden in their life. What is the gain of such life as deprived of even two minutes of recreation?</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Life overpowered by wealth</p>
<p class="Text">Most of the rich people and shopkeepers, government officers and officials, businessmen are always assiduous in earning and counting the money, but they are not conscious of using their time and money for their life and pleasure. Some ignorant persons have made the aim of their life to earn money only. The riches have overpowered their life. That has become the cause of their numberless worries. Even the family life and domestic joys have taken flight from their life.</p>
<p class="Text">Remember, money is the means of life. Life is bigger and greater than money. Don’t allow so much freedom to money that it may begin to rule you and torture your life with the serious burden of worry, anxiousness and meaningless works. Life is more important than money. Its usefulness depends on the progress, prosperity and satisfaction of life. Money is needed in your life only to the extent that it may fulfil your justified needs and may not be an obstacle in the progress. More than that, to hoard the money or to become a capitalist, don’t destroy the divine element like this life. When you are in the possession of the money to fulfil your general needs, use it then for the purpose of enjoyment.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Adoration of supreme bliss</p>
<p class="Text">The real aim of life is to achieve the supreme joy. We should try to get maximum delightfulness, comforts, laugh and happiness. The man deprived of happiness and pleasure, who remained a toiling wretch and bearing the load of the world throughout the life or remained engaged in collecting the money, despite being called wealthy from economic point of view but on the surface of truth, could not take the taste of life. Joy is that spiritual element, which gives our mental wisdom a great delight and contentment, the entire happiness of the world is achieved.</p>
<p class="Text">What is joy? Joy is related to our mind. Our five sense-organs are constantly in process of giving the experience of joy or sorrow to our mind. Every sense-organ may be related to our joy or sorrow. If we maintain every sense-organ active for the feeling of joy, the expansion of joy is possible.</p>
<p class="Text">Our happiness is internal. The men who search for it in the outer material objects are at fault. Making contact with the worldly objects, our all the five sense organs who transmit its knowledge to our inner world, create the feeling of joy in our mind. So to get comforts and happiness, we should keep our mind in the situation of joy and happiness having our mind free from the feeling of disappointment, worry, inferiority complex. This is the main gist of our mental condition.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">New life</p>
<p class="Text">They, whose aim of life is the maximum gain of happiness and delightfulness, reach near it by shaping the same mental condition. This is the element of our mental favour that takes out continents from the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The need of optimistic view</p>
<p class="Text">As much close attachments we keep to the worldly objects, as much we increase our artificial needs, so much worries we invite. Different kinds of worries make the music of our life out of tune and jarring and we fail to create the sweet atmosphere of happiness. We go on peering and vexing making the issue of trifling matters. Our life remains full of botherations. We pass the miserable life of wail and cry associated with worry.</p>
<p class="Text">Don’t remain weeping but remain carefree. Remain establishing closeness more and more with the substance of happiness. The objects or matters for which you remain worried day and night are in your contact for a very short time. Then, why to make our life thorny for them?</p>
<p class="Text">We should lead our life smiling like flowers. Just see the nature, there is the pleasant atmosphere of joy everywhere. How joyously is breezing the morning cool air! Listen to the chirping of birds in the garden. How carefreely flows and falls the water of small and big rivers, fountains and brooks! Every drop as if happens to laugh having been scattered and speaks, ‘O the men of world! Burst to laugh in merry making. Lead the life smiling. Leave the worthless worries.’</p>
<p class="Text">What is the capital with the birds? What amount have they deposited in the banks? For how many years have they made the stock of food materials to eat? How many quilts, beds, costly and decent garments to wear, rooms, motors are there they have? In spite of being penniless, in spite of no arrangement of food, clothes and house for the next day, how happy and carefree life they lead! How melodious and sweet song they sing with carefreeness! See the peacock while dancing! What a carefree and different modes of dance he makes! His dance of fifteen to twenty minutes is a bath in the ocean of joy. He has no worry of either children or worldly botherations. We should learn lesson of joy from these creatures of Nature. We should imbibe the blessedness of their lives.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Take the vow of delightfulness</p>
<p class="Text">Come and be a striver of the truth of joy to give up your artificial and wicked worries and ill feelings and imaginations forever. Go on tasting the taste of life. Colour your each and every nerve of the body in the colour of happiness. Laugh self and distribute your exhilaration, carefreeness and delightfulness among others with liberal attitude. Consider the world full of joy. If we, having given up the mean view about life, ‘This world is the ocean of joy’—Put up this feeling before us, then our sorrow misery, agony and useless worries will end in no time. Our mental tendencies will concentrate in truth, consciousness and bliss solidified God; and our imaginary sufferings and botherations will go away.</p>
<p class="Text">He who has become stable in the Supreme form of spiritual Truth, is really blessed. Having come out of the darkness of ignorance and illusion he has come in the illumination of joy, courage, zeal and hope. By the worship of supreme joy man’s inner and outer life both becomes full of self-satisfaction. He, himself begins to feel that the life afflicted with modification, fear, worry, anger, passion and sensuousness cannot enjoy the bliss of joy, Materialistic granduer and prosperity, money, paramountcy are not the cause of self-contentment.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Let us determine to enjoy happiness always in every situation, in every atmosphere, enjoy the enjoyments of the world; because our concern is with joy. We are born to enjoy only. The adverse and indomitable circumstances can not create hurdle in our merriment. Having changed your outlook and having the ideal of achieving the righteous joy before you lead your life. Wherever in any situation you are, you can lead a joyous life adopting the optimistic view.<span></span></p>

<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved 1/2/2)</p>
<p class="Text">Mean—‘Make your body strong like stone, By hard working and endurace the body becomes strong.’</p>
<p class="Text">In my neighbourhood, a Govt. employee retired from service in the age of fifty-five. He used to say, ‘There will be no work after the retirment from Govt. office and then I will live very happily. I will make my health better only. The rest life will pass very smoothly and there will be relaxation from the hard work and control.’</p>
<p class="Text">And one day, he got his pension. He got relief from the work. Now, he was the sole owner of his time. There was no work but only rest.</p>
<p class="Text">No doubt, he got leisure but his mind began to feel heavy and his health also got as if rust. He passed a few days here and there on the shops, the houses of the friends and acquainted and sitting anywhere in the Mohalla but yet his mind was restless. One day, four days, one month, two months! Ultimately how long to sit! Life is very long, it is unknown how long is its root? He got fed up with inactive life. He became ill. The disease went on increasing and he became confined to his bed. The doctors treatment continued. The man who worked hard for eight hours till a few months back, was the same man showing his pulse to the doctors and was counting the hours of death.</p>
<p class="Text">While lying on the bedstead, there was an inspiration by God that—‘idle life without any work being rusted, will cause death. That is a sort of suicide. So long as body is active, something must be done.’</p>
<p class="Text">Well! He went to his old office. By chance, he got any simple job in the same office on daily wages. He accepted the same.</p>
<p class="Text">A matter of great astonishment! God’s sportive activity! For two to four days, he went to the office any how, but after three to four days, his physical instruments became active and began to work. The instruments that had gone rusted again began to work on account of the practice of work. Due to the engagement in work, he had no time at all to imagine of old age, disease and weakness or useless imaginations.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, he goes to the office as usual. He works like the young men. He gets a meagre amount but he does not care for it. His shackled life is pulling on ahead. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. his day passes in work. His wife is already dead. There is no work at home, but yet he remains busy in work. He expresses the gist of his life in the following words—</p>
<p class="Text">‘I consider the work the best medicine for a man. The active life solves those problems of life where the costly medicines fail. Action expands the span and health in life. By continuing some mental and physical work, a man can live a long life. The long-lived creatures of Nature remain always active. If long life and health is to be achieved, remain busy in work till the last moment of life.</p>
<p class="Text">Eighty years old a female student</p>
<p class="Text">This news is related to Paris. A snow-white haired grand mother had been divorced sixty years ago by her husband due to difference of opinion between them. When she searched work for herself, she found that she could remain more happy in the mental work of study and writing. She again started to study in the Sarbon University of Paris. Eighty years old this zealous lady was still a special student of Sarbon University even in 1905, because in those days, she was studying Science. This lady has three sons, seven grand daughters and one great grand daughter. She considers work most important to remain mentally healthy and long lived. Now, she has taken admission in the University to study English and German.</p>
<p class="Text">She usually says, ‘This is my personal experience that I have come to conclude that by running the machine of man’s body regularly, it works for a long time. The man who remains busy in doing any useful work as much, so much he enjoys the sound health.</p>
<p class="Text">Here, the words said by Mahatma Gandhi, come to my mind that—‘He is the true student, who has a true thirst of getting knowledge, who feels joyous to meet the hardships in acquiring knowledge and who forgets everything making the knowledge the centre and end of life. It anyone studies with the consideration of the knowledge as the means of earning money, then, neither he will achieve the high ideal to achieve his goal nor will his labour prove to be worthful.’</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">One hundred fifteen years old employee of the Post Office</p>
<p class="Text">At Dhanbad, recently, one hundred fifteen years old employee of the Post Office has passed away from the mortal world. People have been heard admiring him highly.</p>
<p class="Text">This is the statement of the acquainted persons that the above mentioned employee of the Post Office performed his duty of a Postman going on foot. Throughout his life, he remained moving out sufficiently. He had a great hatred for the lazy and inactive life. He had not preferred even to buy a cycle. Even in this old age, his mind was cool. He was never found indulged neither in any intoxication nor ever angry.</p>
<p class="Text">Even after retirment from his service, he had availed pension for sixty years. The health of this employee, leaving after him a brimful family of grand sons and great grand sons, was fully maintained due to walking, moving about and remaining busy in any work. Whenever anyone querried of his health, he uttered only one thing, ‘I never sit idle, remain busy in doing something always. This is my conviction that it is the practice of work that can make a man healthy and long lived.’</p>

<p class="Text">The oldest man, Shirali Mislimov of Moscow of the republican state, Ajarbejan of Soviat State celebrated his 159th birthday in Baku. In Baku, a ceremonial funcation was organised in his honour. Mislimov refused to cover the distance of six miles from his house to Baku by car. He went to the place of the function on foot to a distance and then riding on horse. According to ‘Tas’, in spite of being so old Mislimov is quite active. He remains busy in walking on foot and taming the sheep. He does not sit idle. He has interest in work. He neither drinks wine nor smoke cigarette; but he eats vegetables and fruits mostly. His wife is 85 years old and his eldest grand son is 65 years old.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The growing age in Russia</p>
<p class="Text">In Russia, generally people are long lived. In the recent past, it had been published in the papers—‘A one hundred fifty-eight years old farmer, Makhmud Evajov, who had participated in the ‘Agriculture exhibition’ is famous for his long age and balanced moral life in Soviet Union. In the honour of his praiseworthy work last year in 1965 the Soviet government has awarded him with the award ‘Order of Red Banner of Labour’. His experiences are as such—</p>
<p class="Text">‘In continuing the practice of some mental and physical labour the taste of life is created and the body organs remain active properly. By sitting idle they are rusted and grow old untimely. Just as the water remains soft; pure and healthful due to its flow, similarity the nervous system remains active by work. To maintain the youthful potency of the body organs ‘work’ is the most important factor. This is the fatal mistake of a number of persons that they understand that the old persons should not work or minimise their movement. I do tell you on behalf of my personal experience that so long as this body is fit to work, the mind and spirit should be kept loaded with the burden of work. All the limbs of the body should be kept active more and more. To sit idle is harmful to the both—the mind and the body.</p>
<p class="Text">The work plays the decisive role in the growth of  the age. It is the well known fact that a man can live long only on the basis and support of the systemetic work.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The tainted effect of sitting idle</p>
<p class="Text">On one side Iran Patrovich Pavlov the scholar of physical science used to say—‘A clerk remaining busy with his work, which is not very difficult maintains a satisfactory health till the age of seventy, but just when he retires and as a result leaves his daily routine, his body organs become incapable to work and he dies soon. It is so usually with everyone who becomes free from all types of work in the old age. There are so many matters in my knowledge where comparatively active, smart, cheerful and hale and hearty persons who retrive on pension, have suddenly grown weak and fallen ill. This is the reason that after retirement the man should not leave the work completely but he must go on doing some easy works like gardening, music, literary work, moving about going on tours, to tame the pet animals, to feed seed to the birds, full bath, to live in the open atmosphere, to play with the children or to teach them, worship and devotion and to do the work of cleanliness in the temples etc., life giving works.’</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The whole world is active</p>
<p class="Text">Actually, the whole world is active. Inactiveness is apperantly death. Only the man busy with work is healthy, under self-control, free from defile and agitation, cheerful and liberal. The perfection of work gives joy to the living being.</p>
<p class="Text">Lord Krishna has said in the Gita the same thing in these words—</p>
<p class="Shlok">न हि कश्चित् क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत्।</p>

<p class="Text">Means—‘Without action a man cannot remain alive even for a moment. Each and every creature has natural tendency that he should continue doing something. If anyone does not even agree with any purpose of life, even then only to remain alive, work is necessary. The whole world is active.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Then, why do you only considering yourself more aged sit idle doing nothing? Must do something.</p>
<p class="Text">Just mark the working of the world. What is law working in the secret of Nature-functions? What is the character of living being? What is difference between animate and inanimate objects? What is that character that helps us to differenciate the living from non-living? It is very necessary to understand them.</p>

Why is there consciousness and pulsation in them? Why does the Lord Sun continue making day and night from several ages with uninterrupted speed? Why are all—this Nature, this world, this society this great universe—are functioning?’</p>
<p class="Text">Its sole reason is ‘Action’ means activity. In other words all are engaged in action day and night, every minute, every moment. They don’t stop even for a moment. They never take rest. All the animates and inanimates of the world are engaged in action. The whole universe is active. </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">This world is the field of action. There is no place here for the inactives and idles.

<p class="Text">The speed of the train was very fast. There was a turn just infront at a distance and onward there was a junction station. Where the two trains running together could collide and break to pieces. The conductor was a little late in detaining one train, He was thinking that this train would have reached the other main rail line before the next train arrives on the main rail line. Oh! suddenly on the next rail line also, the engine of the other train was seen coming exactly at the same time. The speed was very fast. The signal was down. Within a moment both the running engines collided fiercely and the dreadful accident took place. The whole atmosphere was resounded with the pathetic cries of thousands of passangers. A number of lives were lost and a number of families were ruined. Some were crushed and some lost their legs and hands many were wounded badly. It was a great loss of life and property.</p>
<p class="Text">What was the reason behind all?</p>
<p class="Text">Behind this accident there was only one man. It was a little carelessness of that man; a little laziness! It was a little delay in giving the signal. His momentary laziness became the cause of several deaths.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The junior army was bit late in reaching</p>
<p class="Text">The event is related to the great war of France. A big war was being fought out fiercely. The troops of the force were on attack with the speed of wind on the enemy one after another. The battle of bloodshed and butchering continued for eight hours. The soldiers of the next side of the hill were dedicated active in their defensive role. Both armies had already exhausted badly. If they had fought once more but the last they would have won. A very strong force in aid had been summoned. Every moment the junior army were being waited. The winner side was now confident of the victory. They were now fully confident of the aiding force to arrive in time. So they converted their reserve force of self-protection also into attacking force, and they had begun to fall upon the enemy coming out from the hidden places of the hill. They were confident that the aiding force would join them and they would be victorious.</p>
<p class="Text">But what ill! The aiding force did not arrive in time. The curious eyes were waiting for them every moment in the hope of their arrival. The captain of the troop named Grauchi did not reach in time. What was the result? Do you know?</p>
<p class="Text">The royal force had to face defeat. In the famous war of WaterLoo Nepoleon was badly defeated. He was arrested as a prisoner in the jail of St. Halina and died as a prisoner. </p>
<p class="Text">Ultimately why did it happen so? Napoleon was extraordinary expert in war skill. He had won many indomitable wars. His experience of war fighting was unique. There was not his least fault in losing the war.</p>
<p class="Text">The mistake was that his one Marshal assistant had reached a bit late with his force for aid and had become the cause of a great warrior’s defeat.</p>

<p class="Text">In the business field, a famous firm was struggling against bankruptcy. This firm had a big permanent capital deposited in California. They were expecting the payment of the money to them in a certain period. If that money is in hand, the credit of the firm, the reputation of its owners and their future prosperity was safe.</p>
<p class="Text">But the hammer of destiny! The crooked circular motion of destiny! After one week, the next week and so on the days passed but the gold was not available to them from there. </p>
<p class="Text">At last, that unfortunate the last day also came to reach. When the firm had to pay many bills of big amounts at any cost. Now, the debt had increased the last limit, yet the reputation of the firm owners was giving a semblance from the thin curtain of hope. They were hopeful that they would be surely getting the payment of money from the safe fund of California to make the payment of the increased emergency amount. </p>
<p class="Text">Just in the early morning by cablegram a forceful demand was made to send the amount without any delay.</p>
<p class="Text">Everyone was fully hopeful that there would be  no carelessness and the deposited money would be available before any objection.</p>
<p class="Text">But ill luck! Very shocking! When the steamer reached, it came to knowledge that the money had reached late and till then, this steamer had already been driven away from there.</p>
<p class="Text">The next steamer came with one and half times more than the total increased amount, for the bankrupt firm but oh! Till then, the firm had been declared bankrupt. Due to a bit delay, its credit and the reputation of the owners had been fully ruined.</p>
<p class="Text">Its reason was that the senders of the money support had made a bit delay in sending the money. Would that! They had sent the money a bit earlier, their credit, repute and honour would have been saved.</p>

<p class="Text">A criminal was sentenced to death with the charge of murder. He was being brought away for hanging. He had faced a wicked murderer being compelled of the circumstances.

<p class="Text">Law is blind. Whosoever comes under its approach anytime gets punishment certainly.</p>
<p class="Text">The public was in favour of this man. There were hundreds of prayers in his favour sent to acquit him showing him mercy. The public was in his favour and all had the full expectation that one day before the execution, the order of his acquittal would be served certainly. Even jailer was confident that the prisoner would be released.</p>
<p class="Text">But the morning approached in the wait of the order. The time was running very fast and the black faced death having opened its dreadful jaws, was approaching him to swallow. </p>
<p class="Text">The last moment reached. The preperations of hanging him were being made; even then, everyone was hopeful of the Govt. order to release him. A man remains alive till the last moment with the support of the bright light of hope.</p>
<p class="Text">Probably, the Govt. messenger must be bringing the release-order. Just to come! Came now! But none came. The criminal was taken on the platform for execution. His face was covered with the black cloth like black death. The down bolt was pressed.</p>
<p class="Text">Now the dead body was hanging fluttering. The soul had gone away, the lifeless body was shaking in air. Just at the very moment a horse rider was seen coming with a fast speed. Everyone’s eyes were concentrated towards him. He was the royal messenger. With the release order of the prisoner. Riding the horse madly he was coming. The release order was there in his hands which he showed to the agitated mob raising his hands from a distance.</p>
<p class="Text">But Oh! He had reached a little late. A little hurry could save the life of a man. It was the only mistake that the messenger to bring the release order had reached the emergency spot a little late. </p>
<p class="Text">All these events clear a very important formula of life and that is that we must be very careful about the binding of time. Never get delay or show laziness in the fulfilment of duty.</p>
<p class="Text">A little delay may cause the death of hundreds of men. The repute of the years may go to dust. The pleasure, prosperity joy, peace may vanish.</p>

Let us make our life regular and never remain lazy. The work should be done at the right time. We should shape our life regular, planned and according to definite contour. The usefulness of life is possible only in spending the time mostly in higher works according to rules. There is nowhere irregularity in the course of time. The universe, the regents, the earth and the sun, the moon all the rest eclipses and stars are in the movement with the motion of time. The creation cannot function by the disorder of time. In the entire system of creation this rule is implemented. Then, why only you, should be irregular?<span></span></p>

<p class="Text">Smt. Vinona Bohara is an Indian M.B.B.S. lady doctor. She had visited Geneva (Switzerland) recently in connection with her study. She is expressing her opinion about the labour class of the Western countries.</p>
<p class="Text">‘I found that the labourers there have a high sense of honesty. I have seen them working at such places where there is no officer or any contractor rebuking them for any dullness in work to superwise their work; The labourer will start doing the work at the right time whether the work is a very simple work of merely digging a pit. He will do the work with full concentration for eight hours—neither a single minute less nor a single minute more. Even the sweeper comes by his car and having cleaned the road he goes away. In the countries like Sweden and Norway the living standard of a truck driver is very high; because he earns much more than the labourers here due to his honesty. I have noted it that if the wages are so high there, they have the habit of doing the work with great zeal, honesty and sincerity also. If anyone’s purse is lost, they don’t deviate from their morality for such a small thing; they return it as it is. Here, we always cry of ‘Dharm-Dharm; we maintain the religious clothes outwardly to prove our religious tendency and mind, paste the sacred mark on the forehead and garland in the neck. There is the practical religion. In every day-to-day life there is the religion of honesty. I saw them nowhere telling a lie for very simple things in general. We indulge ourselves in deceit just coming out of the temples. They live the life of Christianity. Their conduct is based on the principles of morality. Their religion is practical religion. Their religion is the practice of morality in conduct. The real strength of any country can be measured by the practical behaviour in righteousness. The practical form of religion is considered the worship of God by them.</p>
<p class="Text">This conclusion is the eye-opener to all of us. In reality, a man may be very honest and true outwardly, but if he is not so in his daily routine of life, he should be called verily a thief.</p>
<p class="Text">He who is not true to his work mentally is a kind of thief. Not to steal any other one’s object but in spite of not even taking the object of others, but if there is desire in the mind to get it, if his mind is tempted for it, really he is committing the act of theft. Not to speak ill of other even, but to think ill of him—is brutish and sin.</p>
<p class="Text">Outwardly such a man may not be considered the victim of punishment but he is a culprit before his soul and gets its punishment also in any form.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">One who is outwardly a thief is a thief; but one who is thief in his mind is a double thief. Firstly, he has the mentality of theft, secondly he shows himself honest outwardly. He is in practice of deceiving others. The practical thief may give up his habit of committing theft to some extent due to some reasons but immune of state rules a mental thief remains always the real thief.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-45">This is the best means for a pleasant life</p>
<p class="Text">If in mind the old tragic memories are active it is better to forget them. Unpleasant matters must be forgotten. To forget them is as necessary as to remember the noble things. If the useless old dry grass are grown in the fields you root out them. The mean, the agitating, jealous, painful memories are just like those old dry grass which spoil the purity of the orchard of innerself. They decay the productive energy. By remembering the mean, worrying feelings again and again, we create a mental hell around us and remain suffering from the sorrow and pain in our past tragic memories. </p>
<p class="Text">It is wise to disband our mind from such tragic concerns. When we disband our mentality from there, it is certain that we will be free from the hell. Forgetfulness has a very auspicious impact. As soon as we are detached from the memory or imaginary fear of pain, sorrow and remorse, we start moving onward towards light from the darkness. So long as a man’s mind is full of tension, sorrow, disease, pain, fear etc., its prowess does not reveal out. Our divine auspicious endowment remains crippled. </p>
<p class="Text">Pt. Ramlal Pahada’s opinion is quite reasonable—‘Whenever the ominous feelings are created in your mind, it is wise to disband and remove them from your mind then and there. It is very difficult to forget weakness, helplessness, inferiority, fear and pain; but to remember God is easy.............If we crush the imaginary bindings, the God will support. Just when we turn our mind towards Him, He supports us in a wonderful invisible way. We remain even unaware of it.’</p>
<p class="Text">A famous doctor of America writes in his article named ‘Medical Talk’—‘After the experience of years I have come to conclusion that There is no other medicine more effective than ‘Forget’, to be free from worry and anxiety, He writes—‘If you want to be healthy by mind and conduct then forget all the things concerning ill health.’ </p>
<p class="Text">In the daily routine of life don’t remain peering being involved with triffling worries. Forget them. Don’t grind them in your mind. Don’t tame it in your innerself or imperceptible, throw it out of your innerself and forget it. Remove it out of your memory.</p>
<p class="Text">I do agree that someone your ‘own’ has hurt you. He has hurt your heart. It may be possible, he might have not done it knowingly, and suppose he has done so deliberately will you then remain engaged in mental conflict with it? Will this worried mental condition lessen your mental hearings? O Brother! Forget those painful unpleasant episodes. Don’t pay heed to them and concentrate your mind to the auspicious noble deeds. Don’t allow the net of worries of the old bitter memories to be weaved. Forget your pains, sorrows and sufferings. Who is there deprieved of sorrows and sufferings? Forget and detach your concentration from there; fix your glance towards hope having removed it from worry, join your mind with pleasure turning it from bitterness.</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever the wounds of hatred, hostility, jealousy, ill will etc., are there in your mind, are being festered and they are creating poison in your own mind, body and spirit. Why do you commit suicide with this poison? Why don’t you enjoy the life? Then, why not to throw off all these matters out of your mind and heart, wash them away from your heart? You will see that by standing on the bright side of life, such a purity will welcome you that your mind and body will become completely pious and healthy; why are you committing suicide with your own hands to think of your agonies again and again? Perhaps, you don’t know about them. That is why I tell you—Forget the worries, remorses, the bitter experiences from the surface of memory.</p>
<p class="Text">‘What should we do at the time of great hardships, miseries? What should we do when we are loaded by the burden of the mountain of miseries, when someone has planned to ruin us and someone very close near and dear to us has entered the jaws of death, on such occasions when our wound is very deep and fatal? Should we forget them also, make them beyond memory? Yes, certainly, forget them also. It may be slowly and slowly but forget them also. Here, is your welfare. In future, you will get more and more pleasure and peace.’</p>
<p class="Text">Neither listen to nor talk of sorrow, worry, and disease. Listen to and talk of only health, joy and love, peace and fraternity and compassion. You will see that you have health, joy, love and peace—everything.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, I tell you on behalf of my own experience, take it granted that it is not very difficult at all to be free from sorrows. It is very easy. It will take some time to make the habit in the beginning, it may be possible that some hurdles might be created, but when the habit is formed, instantly you will dismiss even the biggest worries in a joke and you will become such an expert in forgetting that the problems, making the life poisonous and miserable, will disappear just coming before you. This world will appear pleasant and joyous to you and no wicked feelings of sorrow, scarcity, pain, suffering will exist in your mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Learn to forget. If the health of body and peace of mind is your desired object, then learn to forget. The best means to get rid of worry is to forget.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Don’t peep into the past with mournfal sight. Make the progress of present and future wisely. This is only in your hand.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-46">Hindu religion gives importance to the useful elements of life</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">In Hindu religion the useful deeds have been valued</p>
<p class="Text">There are hundreds of religions in the world. They have their different base and different recognitions. When we compare these religions with the different recognitions of ‘Hindu Sanatan Dharm’, we find one thing very important that Hindu religion stands on the theory of ‘Utilitarianism’. The ancient Hindu thinkers, meditators, scholars and the preceptors have filled their long experiences, deep study, minute vision and observation and original useful thoughts in Hindu religion, only the useful and beneficial matters have been given place in the religion.</p>
<p class="Text">Wereas in other religions, the moral substances, recognition and customs and traditions are not clear in meaning and purpose, but at the same time, every moral recognition in Hindu religion has its meaning, purpose and usefulness. There are some useful substances hidden behind them.</p>
<p class="Text">This religion gives no importance to any outer hypocrisy and false show. There is the priority given to health and healthy thinking everywhere.in it. Such useful proverbs and beneficial hymns are in plenty here which form the healthy mind, healthy body and a developed society. In our ancient books, specially in the Vedas, the Supreme Lord and His worship and devotion, the evolution of spiritual power, the character formation, moral conduct, self-restraint, association of virtuous persons like useful subjects for the individual practice have the valuable priority including the consideration of all round development of the society and nation. Many very useful elements like marriage, happy domestic life, woman’s grace, the preclusion of demerits, health and healthfulness, prohibition of vices, etc., and other many useful elements have been included in religion, where there is only gain and gain.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Hindu religion is the way of life, useful in all respects</p>
<p class="Text">The Hindu intellectuals have remained desirous that those elements, duties, the ways of worship, hymns, exercises, customs and traditions recognitions, the views and thoughts should be included in religion so that the progress and evolution of man and society in all respects—individual, social, physical and spiritual might continue till the end of life. The Hindus might be healthy, long-lived, self-restraint, developed and progressive in all respects in the world. Whatever they thought proper, useful and beneficial for the human life, they included it in the religion, so that the Hindus as a whole should adopt them certainly and go on taking its advantage. There has been the priority of the benefit of scientific outlook in the social conduct of Hindu religion, in all the sixteen ceremonial rites, different functions and festivals. In the idols of gods the support of symbology has been taken. Each and every god has been named with some occult symbolic meaning. The symbolic meaning is hidden in the incarnations also.</p>
<p class="Text">In the ancient time, the awakened public understood the methods of Hindu-worship, the hymns of the Vedas, gods, goddesses, festivals, idols, and the religious books. The Vedic spells were used to be on the tongues of the Public, the divine language like Sanskrit was our mother-tongue. But it is a matter of great regret that our entire religious knowledge has confined to a few learned men because of the inability to understand Sanskrit language. The public fail to understand Sanskrit. So useless blind-faiths, false notions, foolishness, imbecility, have entered the field of religion which are needed to be rooted out from the public mind.</p>
<p class="Text">What are the ordains of our religion from the utility and beneficial point of view. What are benefits from rites and rituals? This is a long subject. Here only a few conducts, rituals and festivals can be discussed from the point of view of their utility.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The useful element for health in Hindu religion</p>
<p class="Text">Hindu religion considers the healthy body as the root of the entire religion. The man of healthy body only can lead a moral life in real sense and only he can enjoy the pleasure of the full span of life and provide the full benefit to the society. What will a weak, sick, deformed man devoid of health understand the secret meaning of religion?</p>
<p class="Text">So, here, human life has been confined in the limit of one hundred years.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Spend the energy of life restraintly—</p>
<p class="Shlok">शतं जीव शरदो वर्धमान:। </p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved 3/11/4)</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘O the Hindus! Live for one hundred years., a progressive and prosperous life. This life potency has been blessed to you to spend very carefully.

<p class="Text">Means—‘If you want righteousness, delivernance, to make this life fruitful, then, go on increasing lustre, courage, vigour, life-force and the growth of energy.’</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Body is the Temple of God</p>
<p class="Text">This body of yours is not only the lump of flesh and bones, not any mean and hateful object, not ignorable, but this is the holy temple of God. God, Himself exists there in the form of soul. On account of the presence of God, it is the most sacred. It needs full care and look after. Considering your body as the holy God-temple, look after it and protect it under the careful watch. The protection of body is the first priority of our religion.</p>
<p class="Text">Some are alway engaged in looking after, increasing the strength and building the body—It is not at all right. Only the body goes on developing and mind, soul and knowledge are neglected, then perversity is created. This perversity must be given up. Making alert from this it has been written—</p>
<p class="Shlok">दृंहस्व मा ह्वा:।</p>

<p class="Text">Means—‘Do become strong but not uncontrolled at all. Improve your health, but don’t torture a weak with your strength. Don’t indulge in vices, mind it.’</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Remain alert in edibles</p>
<p class="Text">In the Hindu religion, edibles and non-edibles have been given the top priority. Non-edible objects (as eating meat, wine, eggs, smoking, stale objectes, heavy, intoxicating edible, gluttony) are totally prohibited. It has been said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">विश्वं समत्रिणं दह। </p>

<p class="Text">Omnivores (without considering edibles and non-edibles) burn themselves in the fire of diseases. They suffer the pain of the hell even on this earth. The fools, having no consideration of edibles and non-edible, remain sick and short-lived.</p>

<p class="Text">Means—‘A Hindu should eat such food which is sweet, tasteful, prepared by the Ayurvedic method. A progressive man should take that vegetarian food, which protects the potency of life having eradicated the diseases. The spicy, pungent, stale meat, eggs and pungent intoxicating meals are abominable.’</p>
<p class="Text">Our meal should be such as may expand our wisdom, talent, age and vigour, constantly.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Sun and wind also like God</p>
<p class="Text">Here, we should get up early in the morning and being fresh from usual body routine, offer water to the Sun. This is considered the part of our religion. It is most beneficial for health and long life. It has been said—</p>

<p class="Text">Celibacy protects semen, this semen is life. The loss of semen or potency is death. After the birth of an issue, it has been considered proper even for the married people to maintain the life of celibacy. The protection of semen is religion.

<p class="Sub-Heading">The science of morning-bath</p>
<p class="Text">The purity of mind and soul comes by the purity of body. By washing the body with water the inner peace and balance is created. The inner and outer germs are destroyed. As a result, there is the gain of appearance, lustre, vigour, age, healthfulness, greedlessness, the damage of ominous dreams, penance wit and purification—all these ten merits. The Hindus have given the top priority to bath. This is the means of the outer purity of the body. In our religion, to bathe in the Ganges, Yamunaji, Godavari, Saraswati, Narmada, Sindhu, Kaveri, etc., rivers is considered the part of religion. While bathing, the Hindu devotee remembers these rivers. These rivers are situated in all the four corners of India. Thus, the attempt has been made to maintain the integrity and emotional unity of India. There are chemical qualities also in the water of these rivers, which provide health as well as long life, our outer and inner are purified.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The science of bath at sacred place of pilgrimage</p>

There are some pilgrimages situated on the places at hills and mountains. There is a very pleasant and healthy atmosphere of Nature.  On those moutntains there are very useful medicinal herbs and fresh air. The sun-rays create purity here. The sacred places of pilgrimage are situated mostly on the banks of the Ganga-Yamuna rivers. In the water of the Ganga there is the mixture of many qualitive effective chemical elements. It is very curative for the body and the health. The curative rays of the sun, moon and stars have also the chemical effect on these sacred places.

The life of an old man extends to one hundred years. He gets a spiritual atmosphere to live.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The purity of Basil-leaf</p>
<p class="Text">In the plant of basil there is the chemical quality to maintain the health, to cure from the diseases and to make the effect of poisonous germs ineffective. In the Malaria fever it kills the poisonous germs and purifies the surrounding atmosphere. Due to its scent the diseases don’t come near us. At the time of death, the basil-leaf in the water of the Ganga river is made to drink. There is a conviction that it removes the obstacles of death. The modern scientists are making researches on the chemical qualities of basil-leaf. The doctor’s conclusion is that by the use of this nectareal plant the mucus is removed, it cures the obstacle of the urine, it sets right the function of digestive system and purifies the blood. The basil-leaf is very useful and effective in curing from breathing problem, Pneumonia, cold-fever, the urine-infection.

Not only one but there are numberless recognitions in Hindu religion which are based completely on the scientific principles, which are directly beneficial to us for our health, youthfulness and in the worldly gain in addition to the spiritual gain. There is a rule of definite conduct from morning till evening and in fulfilling these definite rules there is gain after gain. All our recognitions and entire convictions as—the simple and pure food, the science of remaining silent, the prohibition of eating the market-food objects, fast and Ekadashi vow, fast on particular dates, the benefit of drinking cow-milk the science of the lamp lighted with ghee, the consideration of direction while sleeping, the concept of next world and the science of untouchability etc., are purely based on science.

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-47">Mother Lakshmi should never be insulted with your hands</p>
<p class="Text">The Hindu seers of the highest truth are famous for symbology. They have made such symbols for gods and goddesses which are the source of original thoughts and auspicious feelings to the common people. Our all the three goddesses—Saraswati, Durga and Lakshmi are the three symbols. It is a matter of great regret that we are forgetting its meaning day by day. Saraswati is the symbol of knowledge, Durga is the symbol of strength and Power and Lakshmi is the symbol of wealth and prosperity.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading"> The inclusion of purity in wealth</p>
<p class="Text">The goddess Lakshmi is the symbol of wealth power. According to Indian culture and from the point of view of Hindu religion, goddess Lakshmi is the presiding deity of wealth-power. By her grace, the economic prosperity is gained.</p>
<p class="Text">The Hindus are extremely farsighted. What suits them useful, they make it the part of religion and include purity, sanctity, divinity, proper utilisation, supremecy and restraint in it.</p>
<p class="Text">To give the wealth the form of the goddess means to bring purity in it. We consider wealth to sacred power of the society. The wealth has been given the form of Lakshmi so that it may be used to lead the society on the moral path, to assist the backwards to advance and to fulfil the divine performances. The true meaning of the worship of the Goddess Lakshmi is to use the riches for the upliftment of the society, individual and the nation and its auspicious deeds. That should be spent in the social welfare. Only then, there is the usefulness of money. This is called the worship of goddess Lakshmi.</p>
<p class="Text">Lakshmiji is the symbol of Indian economy. In the use of money whatever the alertness should be observed is included in the worship of the Goddess Lakshmi. They who misuse the money, insult mother Lakshmiji evidently.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Make the proper use of money</p>
<p class="Text">If any domestic virtuous Hindu accepts wealth in the form of Lakshmiji, he should make the proper use of money. We realise the power of money at every step in the modern age. By its proper use we can serve the public at large. Let some basic principles of life suggested by the Indian thinkers be kept in mind. Having the consideration of wealth, truth, justice and public welfare in mind, the earning should be made by moral means and it should be spent in the common interest of the public—</p>
<p class="Shlok">उतो रयि: पृणतो नोपदस्यति। </p>

<p class="Text">Means—‘The wealth of the charity donators never decreases, it multiplies more and more.’</p>
<p class="Text">The money invested in virtuous deeds is secured like the capital deposited in the banks. To use this capital in getting the public rest houses built, in opening the libraries, to start water kiosk, in getting the trees planted, in opening the new schools, in establishing the charitable hospitals, in managing the water for the animals, in managing the work of cleanliness in the villages, granting scholarships for the perspicacious students are the infallible means of the goddess Lakshmi’s worship and service. These virtuous deeds are to uplift the society higher. According to our interest and economic reach let the work of charity and service be decided.</p>
<p class="Text">The money spent in the advancement/uplift of the poor people is fruitful like worship. Money is not to be hoarded but to be spent in the public interest. It has been said—</p>

<p class="Text">It is not only sufficient to remain confined to himself in doing the noble deeds. It is your moral duty; you should inspire your other close friends also to spend money in the pious deeds. Admonish these misers also lacking in wisdom that this money does not belong to yourself but it belongs to the whole society. Money is not to be amassed only meaninglessly but it is the means of making its good use. You, your offsprings, your family, your neighbourers, the state, the country and the whole country can be benefitted by this. It should be spent in the service of poors, penurious and the sufferers.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Always remain mindful of deservings and non-deservings</p>
<p class="Text">But the support should be given to those who deserve. If you support any non-deserving, he may create disorder in the society. After patient observation the service should be given to the men of noble conduct. It is said in the Shastras—</p>
<p class="Shlok">रयिं धत्त दाशुषे मत्यवि।          </p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved)</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘Always use your discernment in charity, make the charity donations only to those who deserve.’</p>
<p class="Text">When you start for public welfare, scrutanize the deservings and non-deservings carefully. Think over patiently.

<p class="Text">Means—‘The divine tradition of charity donation should not be stopped.’ The mother Lakshmi says that whatever the knowledge, vigour, ability and wealth you have, that is to donate to the sufferers in the society, continue to invest it in the interest of others throughout your life.</p>
<p class="Text">Watch it attentively and then come to conclude who is that person of virtuous character who needs your financial support. Don’t be mindful for the propogation of your name. The best financial support is where the donator is unknown.</p>

<p class="Text">The Indian sages have given much more importance to the earnings with honest and proper means with the service motive. It is said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">रमन्तां पुण्या लक्ष्मी:। </p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved7/115/4)</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘This is the tested prescription that the money, earned honestly stays with the man long and causes him lasting gain and benefit. No one flourishes with dishonest earning.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">देवो वार्य बनते।</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘The wealth stays with them only who are virtuous citizens otherwise in the second generation it is wasted and spoiled by the son of bad conduct. If you failed to shape your child virtuous, the plenty of property also is wasted away.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Indian intellectuals have always given recognition to the money earned honestly with better and sacred means. It has been the Indian concept that the moral outlook in business provides divine support. It is never found that the immoral earning has ever proved beneficial. The coming generation has finished it. So, the money should be used in evolution of virtues.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Always have the consideration of the purity of means</p>
<p class="Text">The mother Lakshmi gives us message of the purity of riches, the justification of means and the purity of innerself. This point of view should always prevail in human mind that he should not be blind after money, he should not adopt the means of cunningness, deceit, arrogance, hostility, hypocrisy, untruthfulness, theft, injustice and other immoral means, he should not be entangled with the demoniac vices.</p>
<p class="Text">On account of the impurity of wealth, greed and fraud the behaviour of brothers is guileful, the master and servant are not in harmony, the shop-keeper and consumer are not in good relation. This is all due to the selfish policy of economic transactions; so these relations should be sweet.</p>
<p class="Text">Economy is also the most important part of wealth. This is one of the powers of the Supreme Lord. That is the means of human service and worthfulness. This property of wealth should be used for the evolution of the human greatness.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The message of the freedom from debt</p>
<p class="Text">Whereas on one side, the alertness from the immoral earning has been suggested, on the other side, we have been made cautious from being indebted also. Whatever we earn by moral means, we should live under our means; we should pull on accordinly. We should remain away from false show, fashion, waste of money, spendthriftness, intoxication, cinema, decoration, outer show etc.</p>
<p class="Text">We should have our palate under control. We should lead a restraint life according to the rules of conduct. This is the suggestion of the great persons well-versed in scriptures—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनृणो भवामि।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved6/117/1</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘Limit your expenditure according to your earning, Don’t become indebted even in any adverse situation. Don’t do any such work as may push you into the hell of debt.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनृणा: स्याम।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved 6/117/3)</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘O the mankind! If you want to live happy and with reputation in this world; don’t do any such deed that you have to take loan.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वान् पथो अनृणा आ क्षियेम।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved 6/117/3)</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘He who is free from debt makes progress. The man in debt decays day by day.’</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The intoxication of riches is a demoniac delusion</p>
<p class="Text">If the foolish, those having a little knowledge and arrogants and sinners, become rich and the excess of wealth comes in their hands, this wealth becomes the cause of their downfall. Let us be alert from that side.</p>
<p class="Text">The demons had taken Lakshmiji under their control. So, there is shadow of demons on the wealth. The money collected in the hands of wicked and undeserving persons is invested in demoniac deeds and it is deformed. The pleasure-seeking persons, the lustful persons, having various cravings, libidinous persons, unwise persons do the unholy, dirty and immoral deeds with the money which are always worth shunning. Lakshmiji remains displeased with such works.</p>
<p class="Text">How it is misused when it comes to the hands of fools and immoral persons, has been mentioned in ‘Kadambari’ as such we should always remain alert and active to be escaped from them—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यथा यथा इयं दीप्यते तथा तथा दीपशिखेव कज्जलमलिनमेव कर्म केवलमुद्वमति। अनया कथमपि दैववशेन परिगृहीता विक्लवा भवन्ति राजान:, सर्वाविनयाधिष्ठानतां च गच्छन्ति। तेषां दाक्षिण्यं प्रक्षाल्यते, हृदयं मलिनी-भवति, सत्यवादिता अपह्रियते, गुणाश्चोत्सार्यन्ते। केचित्सम्पद‍्िभ: प्रलोभ्यमाना </p>

<p class="Text">Means—‘The evil minded, sinners and the pleasure-seeking persons begin to engage themselves in the immoral, vicious and corrupt activities with the same speed as the speed of the growth of their riches. It creates the evil thoughts in mind just like the flame of the earthen lamp throws out only the black soot after it.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘If unfortunatgely any how one is caught (means—on bad influence of Lakshmiji), even the kings lose their sense and become the dwelling place of evil deeds. Their liberal mindedness is washed away, their hearts become impure, the truthfulness goes away from them and the virtues run away.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Some are compelled to be out of sense in the greed of money due to the attack of the defilements (Pleasure seeking attitude, evil thoughts, violent and cruel deeds, the vicious schemes of sexuality). They fail to recognise even their friends like the man on the edge of death.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, we should remain always alert from the evils of wealth. As it has been said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मिथ्यामाहात्म्यगर्वनिर्भराश्च न प्रणमन्ति देवताभ्य:, नाभिवादयन्त्यभिवादनाहर्ान्, नाभ्युत्तिष्ठन्ति गुरून्। जरावैक्लव्यप्रलपितमिति पश्यन्ति वृद्धजनोपदेशम्। आत्मप्रज्ञापरिभव इत्यसूयन्ति सचिवोपदेशाय, कुप्यन्ति हितवादिने। सर्वथा तमभिनन्दन्ति तमालपन्ति, तं पार्श्वे कुर्वन्ति तस्मै ददति, तस्य वचनं शृण्वन्ति, तं बहु मन्यन्ते, योऽहर्निशमुपरचिताञ्जलिरधिदैवतमिव विगतान्यकर्तव्य: स्तौति यो वा माहात्म्यमुद्भावयति।</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘The evil minded rich persons of vicious mentality don’t pay obeisance to the gods even in the egotism of superiority complex.’</p>
<p class="Text">They don’t bow down in salutation to deserving elders and don’t stand up in their honour to see them.’</p>
<p class="Text">They take the sermons of the learned old man as the gabbling due to the weakness of old age.</p>
<p class="Text">They are displeased on teachings of the minister and consider it the defeat of their intelligence.</p>
<p class="Text">They are so proud of their wealth that they are in anger even on the adviser of their welfare.</p>
<p class="Text">They give honour, keep in their company and listen to them only who are always day and night remain busy in their flattery with folded hands and leaving their duty praise them just like their deity-God or who declare of their greatness.’</p>
<p class="Text">By remaining absorbed in all the above mentioned evils the mother Lakshmiji is insulted. We should keep ourselves always away from all these demerits and vices. We should not do any such evil deed that insults the mother Lakshmi with our wealth.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-49">Let the tradition of charity continue through your hands</p>
<p class="Text">The Indian culture gives immense importance to the munificence and absolute truth. When our needs combining purity with simplicity are fulfilled, we should donate in charity for the welfare and progress of others. In the ancient time they were the sages, hermits, priests, Brahmans, saints and monks who were selfless and devoted to public welfare and surrendered their entire life for the welfare of human beings. They used to support and help others always. There were some who passed their entire life in imparting knowledge and study. They used to make efforts for the enhancement of the knowledge, health, efforts, co-operation, joy, comforts, wisdom, morality etc., virtues of the people through their sermons. They passed most of their time in the development of the spiritual truth in human nature. These learned and liberal saints were the institutions of living benevolence in themselves and the form of Yagya. When they were so much dedicated to the public service, the public also managed for their food, residence, clothes, bringing up their children, considering their moral duty. As today in the present time the public welfare institutions are running with the public contribution, similarily the saints and Sadhus, Brahmans also lived their life depending on the charity donation, auspicious contributions and alms etc. The character and mentality of the ancient saints and their personality used to be so higher and dignified, so sacred and holy and so pure combined with simplicity that there was no room for any doubt even in the imagination about them; because the public used to remain confident of the right use of their donations after donating them. The public did not think the need of the audit of the account. Thus, our priests, the Brahmans imparting knowledge, the Munis, sages used to manage for the all-round development of the public with the money got in the charity donation. The system of fulfilling the needs of their life by the charity donation was justified, he who has dedicated his whole life and absorbed so much in the public service, in the munificence and absolute truth that he may not even think of his individual gain, deserves to be looked after by the public.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, the tradition of charity donation started. In the due course of time, the charity donation for the blinds, crippled, lame, leper, incapable of making any earning—all types of helpless persons who were not capable of earning for their livelihood, came in practice. They deserve also to accept the alms because there remains no other means for them to continue their life. In this way, the system of charity donation has been prevalent in two ways—</p>
<p class="Text">1. The financial aid to the saints, Brahmans, priests, preceptors, hermits was given the name of ‘Charity donation’, 2. The name ‘alms’ was given to the crippled persons, lame, disabled person, unable to do any earning. The charity donation and alms, both meant to help others. These both should be used for the enhancement of ability, benevolence, virtuous deeds, public welfare, joy and peace and purity combined with simplicity.</p>
<p class="Text">What does to give to others mean? The Indian tradition of charity donation is nothing but the scientific system of lending. Whatever we give to others is deposited like our secured capital. The better in charity donation is that which is given to one who suffer from scarcity. To dontate to the person who is not in need, has no importance. The money donated to the non-deserving is useless. If more food is fed to the person whose stomach is full, he will fall ill and he will drag the donator also along with him towards the downfall. According to the Indian culture the charity donation is a very noble work. He who eats his loaf of bread with distributing it to others also, never goes in the scarcity of anything. How will the hard-hearted persons, who dig their money in the earth adding to more and more, come to realise what is the mental contentment and self-satisfaction in charity donation? The self gets exhilarated. The death is the most unpleasant but to see any other one in sorrow and finding himself helpless not to help him by any way is more unpleasasnt than death even. This is unanimous opinion of all the Hindu Shastras that the total sum of human life is benevolence. We should remain devoted in the human welfare to the best of our capacity. But this donation should not be for the arrogancy, egotism, repute but for the self-redemption. It is not proper to think that I have done good to others. Charity donation does good to the donator himself. It gives us the lesson of self-control. If you don’t even donate, even then, the world will go as usual. The Lord is so generous in squandering His abundant store that even without our least support the public work will not suffer. If you don’t give, any begger will not die of hunger. Any how his food will be managed; but you will lose an opportunity of benevolence. Your liberal tendency of benevolence will be damaged and blunted. The mental evolution and the spiritual power achieved by the charity donation is not beneficial to the receiver but to the donator. To do good to others is a kind of means of our own redemption. What a big benefit we may give to anyone by supporting him with a little amount? But in comparison we do our benefit thousand times. It develops our liberal mentality. The source of joy opens.</p>
<p class="Text">Charity is the divine quality of spirit. The Sattvic sentiment of benevolence in whose innersense it is aroused, it turns him to be liberal and a cluster of radiance. The charity is not confined to money or food and clothes only, but labour can also be donated in charity. The true donator gives priority to the public welfare. He donates even his bones like Dadhichi for the general welfare of the mankind. Like Vyasji, he spends his entire life in the creation of virtuous books. He preaches the knowledge of weapons like Dronacharya. He originates the grammar like Panini, preaches the sermon of love and religion like Buddha. Thus, a true charity donator donates his talent, wit, ability, art, intelligence and energy according to the time and necessity of the country.</p>
<p class="Text">This is the discussion of the donatior’s side. Now see the next side of the receivers side who accepts the charity donation. To accept begging and charity donation is an act of a very heavy responsibility and to bear this burden is found among a very few courageous men. The scholars of Shastras have compared the alms with fire. Just as the fire should be used very carefully otherwise it can create a great havoc and loss; similarily a well consideration and better thinking is needed before accepting the alms or charity. You should remain always ready to give just double of the accepted alms or charity in return to the donator. Your needs be very limited. The effort should be made for the service, support and solving the problems of hardships of the donator or remain giving lofty sermons in the form of well wishes and blessings.</p>
<p class="Text">There are two purposes of charity or alms—The first purpose is that by the act of charity the donator gets self-satisfaction of sacrifice and benevolence. The second purpose is that the sages, seers and Brahmans get the opportunity to remain moderating and purifying their pride and egotism. In the ancient time, the public servants, benevolents and the saints adopted the bare position of a begger to remain free from egotism. In donating charity or alms to such beggars, the donators felt their honour and the beggars became free from egotism. This increased a strong feeling of mutual brotherhood and affection. The donator usually remained in gain more than the beggar. To give spiritual help to the strivers seeking God-realization, this system of begging had been made. In fact, this begging was proper and according to treaties of the Shastras too:</p>
<p class="Text">Nowadays, several lazy and idle persons, fraudulenters, wicked beggars and cheaters, taking the advantage of this profession, are in practice of cheating the people. As regards themselves, they don’t want to do any work and want to enjoy the money got without any effort. Last year, the number of beggars had gone high as fiftysix lakh. The number of real sufferers of the distress is only nominal, but mostly they are those who take the disadvantage of others labour; and in the name of morality and righteousness are engaged in the profession of begging by several types of ostentations, mean deceptive conduct and untruthful behaviour. It creates the poisonous and disasterous atmosphere in the society. By doings so there is the spread of untruthfulness, hypocrisy, false show, deceit and intoxication in the society. So, it is our duty to remain alert from such cheaters who are grabbing free money without any work in the name of morality and religion.</p>
<p class="Text">Its has been said in our religion—</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘दानशूरो विशिष्यते’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Means—‘That  is the munificent person  who is foremost among the mankind. In other words the munificent person holds the dignified position among the men in the society.’<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-50">Move towards divinity</p>
<p class="Text">Mental struggle between god and devil—In our mind there continues usually the conflict of the two contradictory feelings constantly the conflict between good and bad, truth and untruth, the struggle of gods and demons. In the Purans the description of the battles of gods and demons has been made from step to step. In every Puran on any pretext, the wars between some gods and some demons have been described again and again. What is this?</p>
<p class="Text">Actually, this is a kind of symbol. In the symbolic way, the effort has been made to show that the struggle between the virtuous and vicious mentalities of mankind, this struggle of gods and demons has been continuing from eternity and will continue till eternity. None is spared from it. The problem of truth and untruth is perpetual. </p>
<p class="Text">In the Gita, whatever the description of the holy battlefield of Kurukshetra and in the Mahabharat the description of the Kauravas and the Pandavas representing the immoral side and moral side respectively, has been made that is not limited only to the battle of arms but that is the symbolic description of the constant conflict of our innerself regarding two contradictory tendencies of truth and untruth, the virtues and vices, god and devil.</p>
<p class="Text">The scholars of Shastras were proved expert enough in conveying the divine knowledge to the reach of the common public. They have a hidden meaning also behind all the fables of the Purans. A wise man can easily understand this hidden meaning and can take the broad sense, hidden in it to his heart. There are two contradictory sides in all the moral fables—One is immoral and uncontrolled and the second is fully moral and restrained, one is righteous and the second is vicious, one is of the gods, the second is of devils, means the demons. The struggle of these two opposite characters have been described in the Mahabharat and the Ramayan. Both the feelings are worth reflection.</p>
<p class="Text">As described in the Ramayan, the army of monkeys and bears, of Rama and the army of demons consisting demons like Ravan, Kumbhkarna and Meghnad, their regular war between them and ultimately the victory of Rama, is the symbolic description of our internal mental condition. In the Mahabharat the side of the Pandavas respresents the truth, justice, ethics, honesty and theism and the Kaurava side represents falsehood, deceit, violence, injustice and dishonesty. After a long struggle between the both we find the success of the divine side.</p>
<p class="Text">In the ‘Adhyatma Ramayan’, the representation of God-devil war has been made more clearly. All the incarnations of the Lord are with the purpose to destroy the collected sins in the society and to establish the morality and divinity, to protect the gods and annihilate the demons. Such incarnation can be felt in innersenses of several amongst us also being incarnated from time to time.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">This struggle of sin and virtue</p>
<p class="Text">In the innerself of the mankind both the tendencies of virtue and vice are hidden in the form of seed. When we bend towards evil, vices, untruthfulness, deceit, jealousy and violence and torture the weak and helpless or exploit others, our demoniac or devil character dominates. On the next side, when we become restrained to love, justice, truth and wisdom, our divinity gets flourished. The demoniac and divine are the two mighty forces of our mind, brain and character. These are the two tendencies—Sin and virtue of our mind are the two sides, the two aspects. Out of them one is the intoxicating black side and the second is bright snow-white pure mixed with simplicity like winter moon light.</p>
<p class="Text">In everyone some evil sacraments of ruthlessness and sin are present. In some persons these demonic characters are strong for a long time, and later on they are subsided and become well cultured. In the duration of passing lacs of years through the highly mean classes of births in the animal and demon classes, these demonic elements remain clinged to our soul. In the proportionate of our collected noble deeds slowly and slowly these demonic characters go on decreasing. Yet even throughout the human life they remain dominating and strong in some persons. The struggle between demon and god goes on continuing. The brutish tendencies of sin and untruth remain creating conflict and disturbing the peace of man’s mind.</p>
<p class="Text">In some of the men the devil mind and demoniac mentality are very strong. When the brutish mentality grows up very strong, they come to commit such vicious acts such sinful acts, intoxicating and violent deeds which remind us of the demons like Ravan and it becomes fresh in our memory. Those mean mentalities overpower them and they commit unrestrained evil deeds in their influence.</p>
<p class="Text">The fury of demoniac wit is mostly in two forms—1. The unrestrained dance of sexual passion, 2. The fierce blast of wrath. In addition to it, the naked demonstration of the mental agitation, intoxication, jealousy, passion and emotional fury are seen in the demons. In the momentry demoniac frenzy or mental agitation, the men of demoniac mentality happen to do such unwise deeds which result is unexpected dreadful.</p>
<p class="Text">The men of demonic mind spread poison in the society because by its imitation the other men are also stimulated to do evil and it awakens the vice mentality of others and the whole society is affected. The immortality starts growing, the entire atmosphere is polluted with disorder, rowdyism and unrestrained behaviour and its demonstration is seen at a broad level.</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever the mean mentality of rift, non-cooperation, breach, separation, narrow mind, exploitation, selfishness, violence, barbarism, plundererism, kidnapping etc., vices are seen in the society is the blackness of demonism.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Demon is very mighty</p>
<p class="Text">The demon and god, both are of the same appearance, of mankind. They are distinguished on demon and god on the basis of their different opposite mentality of innerself. Those elements creating wrath, hostility, clash and disturbance are called demonic elements. Those men who diffuse such vice elements of selfishness, clash, violence and disaster in the society or in the world; support deceit, hypocrisy, fraud, arrogance and tyranny; pollute the atmosphere with jealousy, hostility and hatred—really they are demons in the form of human beings. Their feature, hands,legs, mouths and head face look like man’s external appearance basically but basically they are demons. Their mind remains always running towards the brutish and demonic mentality of sexual and sensuous passion. Their speech and behaviour is always bitter.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The demonic food</p>
<p class="Text">The demons meal is Tamasika and Rajasika. There is no consideration of edible and non-edible in their meal. They daily use meat, wine, eggs, intoxicating objects, onion, garlic etc. By this vicious meal their brutish instincts remain overpowering them always.</p>
<p class="Text">One of the causes of wicked nature is the Rajasika, food also. The excess use of pickle, sauce, sour, heavy, the sweets of different types, red chillies, the drug prepared from hemp leaves and buds, hemp, Hashish, opium, wine, intoxicating drug made of opium, crude cigarette, cigarette, tobacco, soda, lemon etc., all the stimulating food objects are Rajasika. It stimulates the sexual feelings and agitation of man.</p>
<p class="Text">The Tamasika meal is worse than this also. There is the excess use of stale—polluted, tasteless, foul smelt, rotten, oil and the objects prepared from ghee, meat, wine and intoxicating objects in it. By eating all these types of objects man becomes wrathful, sensuous and sexual, immoral, violent, greedy, lazy and vicious. By the use of such demonic food the mind lives in the condition of greed, passion, lust, wrath and agitation.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The demonic tendencies</p>
<p class="Text">The mean mentality of man is called demonic feeling. It remains present secretly hidden inactive in his mind and comes out in the different repulsive, nasty mean despicable form.</p>
<p class="Text">Today we are observing different types of vulgarity, intoxication, dishonesty and evils in the society. The people become agitated, violent, disturbed and turbulent on the triffling matters. They feel proud of on the triffling matters. They feel proud of on the matters of no importance. They use slanderous words and quarrel. Being emotionally mad and agitated they come to clash. The suicides are generally committed in such a perturbed condition. There are the dreadful reactions of demonical frenzy. Now-a-days, daily we go through the tragic news of suicide, clash and litigations, the triffling matters are taking the giant shape. The politics has became the battlefield of groupism.</p>
<p class="Text">Today, the diseases, sorrow and worries have affected the society in excess. The people are dying of heart-attack even in their young age. One of the chief reasons of heart attack is the constant worry of a man. The mental evils are more in the cities than that of in the villagers. The useless thinking and tension is mostly the cause of madness. The insanity of anger and jealousy has badly covered the society.</p>
<p class="Text">This increasing mentality of clash and struggle is demonic instinct. This is the disasterous and mostly mentality hidden secretly in our inner mind, it is very difficult to get pleasure, peace and balance. It is this wicked character of our mind which is the root cause of all the domestic clashes, long sickness, ill-behaviour, illegal abortion, social stigma, insult, poverty, retaliation, demonic frenzy, like all the tragic diseases. Ill thoughts is almost the wickedness. Passion of sensuousness is apparently poison.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Let us proceed towards divinity</p>
<p class="Text">All the creatures in the form of human-beings in the world can be divided into three classes according to their virtues, action and nature—1. God, 2. man and 3. demon. All these three are similar in colour, shape, figure, like a man but their virtues, action and nature differ from one another. They are the demons who are fallen down with the point of view of thought, life, goal and food. They eat meat, keep the ill-thoughts of agitation, passion and desires in their minds. The demon remains always alert for his own selfish interest. I should grab everything, I should remain always in gain, my passions and desires should always remain fulfilled, there is no concern to others—such thoughts are there only in the men of demonic mentality. That outlook is absolutely impure.</p>
<p class="Text">In real sense he is the man who looks both the sides—gain-loss, liberal-miser, self and others, own and the rests, whereas he brings up the feelings of love and genrosity in his mind on one side, on the next side, he feels jealousy, hostility and hatred etc., also in his mind. Man is the bundle of weakness. He considers gain and loss and in the influence of present gain he comes to commit errors. His self-interest goads him to do otherwise. Due to impure outlook, man’s thoughts and actions turn to disaster. He remains wandering about on the lowest surface of materalism. He spoils the invaluable divine blessing like human life among the domestic, worldly and economic problems.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The feeling of divinity is great</p>
<p class="Text">The state of divinity is the Supreme State. By assuming the divine sentiment man becomes blessed. In this world whatever the condition has been imagined to be the source of immortality, that is included in the divine character.</p>
<p class="Text">In the feeling of Divinity there is the purity of Godliness. In our concept of our ideal, the Supreme Lord is the mass of Supreme higher powers. All the noble qualities of man—love, mercy, pity, friendliness compassion, courage, patience, generosity—emerge from the Supreme Lord, god is His part. Divinity is  the lustre of spiritual power and holiest particle of Divine majesty.</p>
<p class="Text">The feeling of Divinity is the feeling of immortality. The gods don’t give any importance to this transitory body of bones and flesh. This earthly body is to be perished in a very short time. The body is born, grows up, but very soon it is perished also, but the soul is undecaying, immortal, eternal. Soul is the part of the Supreme God. The feeling of Divinity is the feeling of the spiritual supremecy. By realizing ourself the eternal spirit, by self-realization, the body does not feel the pains of death. The man considering himself god always observes with spiritual sight. He always considers that he is the soul. My real eternal form is indivisible impregnable, imperishable, endless. My soul can never decay at any cost.</p>
<p class="Text">The man dwelling in the higher mental sphere of divinity, thinks that he is pious, pure internally and externally both. No vicious demonic attack on him is possible.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The morality of divinity</p>
<p class="Text">The worshipper of divinity discarding the peity worldly outlook always watches everything with spiritual eyes. He adopts pure Sattvika nature combined with in mind, speech and action. He has no interest at all in the transitory pleasures, worldly attractions and materialistic allurements. He assumes and develops those noble and higher qualities in himself day by day which are beneficial for the public in general.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The centre of all virtues</p>
<p class="Text">The sentiment of Divinity only is the central point of all the spiritual and divine powers and that is the emerging point of the entire spiritual divine energy. The inner ambition of the soul is to merge into the Supreme Almighty at last by self-evolution. Our soul is nothing but verily God itself. We can plan for our spiritual evolution by developing the virtues of the soul, which is the compact of truth, consciousness and bliss.</p>
<p class="Text">In fact, as much as we meditate and ponder over the divine properties of the soul so much we are benefitted with the noble company of divine bodies who have reached the highest position due to their spiritual evolution, so much we reach close to the absolute truth. The ultimate goal of man’s life is to be developed in the form of Supreme Lord. Our auspicious instincts are to develop the divine virtues.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Divinity is hidden in you</p>
<p class="Text">Know it granted that the shadow of the divinity is present in your this body unobtainable even to the gods. You have obtained this class of birth after wandering about through numberless classes of births and rebirths. There is need of only one leap for the embodied being in this body. By this effort he can be able to bear the responsibility of absolute truth.</p>
<p class="Text">Such numberless great persons of divine merits have been born who are yet even today the pillars of illumination. Shivi, Dadhichi, Harishchandra, Moradhvaj, Prahlad, Buddha, etc., were gods despite their human bodies. They are immortal. These immortal persons will be always counted in the category of gods. They will always remain the source of the message of the highest knowledge, devotion, service, sacrifice, generosity to the humanity.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The theistic faith</p>
<p class="Text">The indomitable faith in God, reverence and faith in the eternal existence of God is the strong base like the boat to cross this ocean of the world. The Divine sentiment is the spiritual process based on theism. In the world it is he who has faith in the existence of God and spiritual support also in addition to the materialistic bases, becomes victorious. The feeling of theism is a base. By the support of theistic feeling and spiritual powers even the great miseries go away.</p>
<p class="Text">In the words of a great learned scholar, ‘Generally, in all the religions the existence of All-pervading and All-powerful God has been made the base of faith and devotion. When the man finds himself attached to the existence of All-pervading mighty, Divine Reality, his energy becomes so powerful that he moves ahead being balanced in spite of his mental conflicts, worldly pains, materialistic problems.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Firm faith in God and indomitable conviction provides mental balance and strength to the mankind.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘To unite ourselves to the Divine entity, seeking shelter, self-surrender and hymns have been considered the constructive form of religion. The processes of contemplations, pondering, conviction, concentration, meditation etc., have been managed for the union with the Divine entity, to gets the inspiration of strength and mental balance.’</p>
<p class="Text">The above mentioned words clear the significance of theistic feelings and view. By developing the theistic emotions and feelings, man gets union with the supreme powers of the spiritual world. He becomes introvert sparing himself from the mean worldly ups and downs.</p>
<p class="Text">Our Sanatan Dharma is based on this concept. By the means of prayer, we take advantage of establishing our close contact to this power storage. We feel excessively contented and peace in our mind after the worship of God. We become free from all mental tensions. All the great thinkers of the world have emphasized to adopt theistic view. You should also adopt it in your life and take the advantage of Divine feelings.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The feeling of devotion</p>
<p class="Text">There are different forms of God. There are several different idols and paintings in the form of gods; there are numberless temples of God. By awakening the devotional feeling in these idols, these temples and these paintings, the dwelling of God becomes possible. The existence of God lies in the higher feelings of devotion. The God presents Himself in the mental attitude. We get the sight of God, where we instal His idol with devotion. To centralise around the faith is devotion.</p>
<p class="Text">In the words of a famous thinker—‘For the faith in God, devotion is very important. In the worldly life and in the physical sphere love has its limit, when the same love becomes active in the inner sphere of self, it becomes devotion.’</p>
<p class="Text">The realization of that Supreme God is possible only through devotion. Devotion handsover the entire oar of this life boat to the hands of God.</p>
<p class="Text">What fear has he whose life is in the hands of God? He, who holds the hands of God, becomes fearless. The God illuminates his whole life.</p>
<p class="Text">Devotion fills our life with such a firm conviction which always follows us and supports us like armour. It is only devotion that can unite us with the spiritual truth (God). By the faith in God we unfold our divine traits and rise above the mean demonic and brutish mentality.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Develop in yourself the virtuous merits of Gods Sense of Truthfulness</p>
<p class="Text">Truth has the first and foremost place to awaken the divine feelings. Truth is the form of God, the untruth is demonic property. The men of Godliness always search out truth and adopt it. They always speak the truth; they make truth the base of their life, they keep false and untruth at an arm’s length.</p>
<p class="Text">The seer Vedvyas has given the topmost place to the truth among the divine merits. He writes that—all lofty divine propensities are included in Truth. ‘There is included non-violence and non-theiving etc., in truth. Mahatma Gandhi was such a votary of truth that he used to say that after knowing truth nothing is left to know. Well! Who needs to be guided the light of sun?’ The truth is itself illumination and itself evident. Man’s deliverance is possible only then when he comes to know the different forms of truth well and try his best to practise it in his daily life. This is the best means to proceed towards divinity.</p>
<p class="Text">Truth is the part of divine feelings. ‘Just while pronouncing ‘Truth’ the tongue gets a great satisfaction and peace, just while thinking the mind becomes cool; and by installing truth in heart, the heart feels cold. By being entangled with the illusory creation, this man, the immortal prince of God has become beast having fallen down from the humanity—he is suffering from the imprecation of ignoring the truth. In the whole frolicsome activities of God there is everywhere truth. Every particle of life is thirsty of ‘truth’ only. This life only means moving in the element of absolute truth we should drink nectar.</p>
<p class="Text">The ‘Shruti’ says—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘असतो मा सद‍्गमय’</span> ‘Let us move towards truth from untruth.’ All the programes of our life, the entire success, the ultimate goal is hidden in one word—that is ‘Truth’.</p>
<p class="Text">Brothers! Move towards truth giving up untruth, false, deceit, all these forms of evil conduct.</p>
<p class="Text">Just as the calf of a cow milking the udder of the mother cow, gets only milk, similarily, by the study of Vedas, nothing purer than the milk of truth is available anywhere. Truth is the ladder to heaven, just like the ship to cross the sea. There is the presentation of truth only in the Vedas. It is only truth that has been mentioned as the absolute fruit. Penance, morality and restraint—all these are included in truth.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">The sense of justice</p>
<p class="Text">Due to the hidden wickedness and barbarism in human being different kinds of injustice are created. A man tortures another one only due to his demonic attitude.</p>
<p class="Text">The inner darkness creates injustice. The animals have no sense of just and unjust. Due to this downfall in our society, the injustice is spread over in the houses, families, castes, institutions and groups. The foolish men of strength are doing injustice to the wise weak. The fools are ruling the wise. This barbarism can be subsided only when we assume the divine mentality of justice in all respects.</p>
<p class="Text">Injustice is created by sin and immorality. The weakness invites others to do the acts of injustice. The big wild violent animals are present in the world. But they fail to dominate us due to our more strength. So, being, powerful, we should try to prevent injustice. To prevent injustice, develop your mental, physical and financial strength. Always keep it in your mind that God has to incarnate again and again to remove sin, immortality, injustice from the world.</p>
<p class="Text">If others oppress you, if they are unjust to you then, begin atonce to become strong. Don’t think that you are alone and bereft of means. It is better to go on following the path of justice by your noble conduct than to become stronger capitalist by adopting the sinful and immoral means. Attention! Let not your unjust hands rise on anyone.</p>
<p class="Text">Ultimately justice wins sentiment of generosity. It is justice which is morality.</p>
<p class="Text">Sentiment of generosity is a divine quality. The gods are always generous by nature. They support and co-operate everyone with the same sentiment without any discrimination of caste, creed, condition or good or bad. The narrowness cannot approach them.</p>
<p class="Text">Miserliness is not our spiritual quality. The spirit is generous. There is no limit of its bound. Whenever we see with the spiritual eyes, all the creatures appear verily our own and own. When we see ourself with the angle of spirit, due to considering everyone the part of God, we find our own friend, well-wisher, member of our family and brother. In everyone there is the existence of the same single spirit. With the point of view, internal unity, love and co-operation all are found included in the great quality of generosity. He who assumes generosity with broad outlook, the entire world is our own, the loss of one is the loss of all, the gain of one is the gain of all. By the mentality of generosity we remain active in the collective uplift.</p>
<p class="Text">The unity means by divine mentality that you should not consider yourself, body but spirit and assume the qualities of truth, justice, love, wisdom, generosity etc., which are your real endowment.</p>
<p class="Text">Read your innerself and findout such mean works which are not favourable to your pure, righteous element like spirit.</p>
<p class="Text">Do only what suits your spirit. Start giving up the works from just today which are against the dignity of your soul.</p>
<p class="Text">Your soul is the divine touch stone of the discriminate truth-untruth, righte-wrong, good-bad. At the time of confusion, that discriminates milk and water. Don’t make the least delay at all in growing that work or thought that creates the feeling of internal joy, happiness or self-elation even if you might be presuming any worldly loss of present either directly or indirectly—This is the straight way of self-realization.</p>
<p class="Text">‘In our life and actions, the divine element will certainly be visible. I am shaping my life and thus, approaching God.’ Root this thought firmly in your mind—</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Our soul is the reflection of God. Basically, there is such a divine power, that inspires a divine intelligence by its influence. To realize this spirit, to develop its qualities, to obey its command should be our ultimate goal.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-51">Learn the genuine use of compassion, forgiveness and punishment</p>
<p class="Text">There are several means of human welfare in Indian culture. The seers and sages of Hindu religion have decided the traditions of Shastras after the serious consideration of each and every aspect of human life. Our culture is full of the wish of the highest  good and deliverance of even the meanest and downfallen. In the Hindu Dharma, the exhilarating messages of new hope and zeal have been given to everyone, how much lower to any extent he may be and the society has accepted him fallen down to any extent. It becomes possible only by the genuine use of these three—Compassion, forgiveness and punishment. So, its real significance should be understood well.</p>
<p class="Text">Kindness is justified moral of the human being. He who is in distress, crying for your support deserves your mercy. Those, who are weaker than you, who are younger than you in age, who are in pitiable condition deserve your mercy and you should be certainly kind to them. Mercy is your duty. To serve others means—You serve yourself. The complete humanity is not possible only by courage and vigour, it needs to be combined with the tender feeling of mercy also.</p>
<p class="Text">It is the mercy, that divine quality which is expected by God from you to support his brethren. Mercy is a very important virtue for the protection of humanity and to remove the patient’s diseases, to free the poors from poverty and to remove the distress of grieved ones. Effort should be made to hold on to it. The sphere of your mercy should continue to be extending. It should not be only for the mankind but it should include birds, animals and small insects, moths also.</p>
<p class="Text">But mercy also has its limit. The man who does not prosper or progress by your kindness once or twice is not a man and he is a stone. What we see in the society that a number of beggars have made begging as their profession in the pretext of mercy. This is misuse of mercy. Many other such examples will be there, which ought to be avoided.</p>
<p class="Text">Forgiveness is an other part of our mercy. He who misbehaves with us, or causes harm to us and becomes the cause of our trouble and loss, should be forgiven if he repents with true mind. Usually, several wicked persons become aggressive towards the path of progress after forgiveness. Human life is invaluable. So, once or twice even the guilty should be forgiven and the means of progress should be provided to him. Today in our society many neglected castes, distressed, backward persons are there who deserve our mercy and sympathy.</p>
<p class="Text">Society is the association of men. It consists of advanced ones and backwards both. It is only the mutual treatment of love and kindness that can run the society in right order. Co-operation is the religion of human spirit. Forgiveness provides a new opportunity to a man to improve himself.</p>
<p class="Text">Punishment is the last limit of our culture. The wickeds must be suppressed. In the public interest, if a wicked is punished even breaking the general rules to some extent, it is not worth abandoning. Maryada Purushottam Shri Ramchandraji had to kill Bali by hiding himself. Bali was wicked, he had lost his consideration of right and wrong and the subject had trembled by his sensuous tortures. There was none to face him in war and kill him. One who came to fight with Bali face to face, his half of the vigour was transfered to Bali automatically. So, Shri Ramchandraji had killed from the back of the tree instead of coming face to face. In the interest of the nation it was justified although it was the act of breaking the general rule of war. The wicked was ultimately punished, whatever the way was adopted.</p>
<p class="Text">Similarily in the war between Kauravas and Pandavas, the family preceptor Dronacharya caused a great havoc on the army of the Pandavas and there was a great ruin of their army. The Pandavas got afraid to see it. If the Kauravas had won, it would have been created the reign of injustice and torture. So, Shri Krishna got an elephant named Ashwathama killed. The name of Dronacharya’s son was also Ashwathama. When Dronacharya heard from the mouth of Shri Krishna that Ashwathama was killed, he got perturbed. On this very moment, he was killed. If Drona had not been killed on some pretext, the Kauravas would have won and it would have been the victory of immorality.</p>
<p class="Text">In Bihar, a big tyrannical king, named Jarasandh ruled there. He had grabbed about eighty small states of the kings and had kept many queens in his gynaecium of the palace having kidnapped them. The wicked Jarasandh was extremely mighty and no one was capable to face him. That is why Shri Krishna, himself in the disguise of a Brahman accompanied Arjun and Bhim and reached the gynaecium of Jarasandh. There He disclosed Himself a Brahman and in his own palace having managed shrewdly the wrestling between Bhim and Jarasandh, got him killed. In the same way, when Karn killed Arjun’s son by deceit, Shri Krishna took its revenge also.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, from time to time for the repression of torture and wickedness of the world and protection of truth, love, justice, there is a rule of punishment in Indian culture. To punish the wicked by trick, diplomacy or even by hiding ownself with purpose of righteousness or the good of the nation is not immoral. A number of wickeds and demons were subdued and punished and as a result of the same our culture is surviving. <span class="char-style-override-5">‘शठे शाठ्यं समाचरेत्’ </span>The policy of ‘Tit for tat’, only due to following this policy, our culture is on the top of glory.</p>
<p class="Text">Mercy, forgiveness and punishment—judicious use of all these three should be made in human life. Its practice needs cautiousness and intelligence. It is the morality and righteousness to forgive them showing mercy who are weak, helpless, distressed, deserve your support. As divine laws and mercy of God are equal for all, similarily your kindness and forgiveness should be for the whole mankind—It is possible that they may adopt the new path of life by your forgiveness and may start to pass the life of high ideals. If there is such a man of any country, any city, any village or in any condition and if you meet him, who may be uplifted by your kindness, forgive him for his past faults. The feeling of forgiveness, itself, is to create peace and balance to your own heart, it is a joyous elegant instinct to enhance the spiritual happiness and joy. He who wants undecaying pleasure, should remain free from the feeling of jealousy, malice and hostility. Forgiveness and kindness will free you from these wicked sentiments.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Practice the use of punishment after well consideration. Attention! On the basis of individual hostility to do injustice is such a type of two-edged dagger which wounds the weak but it does not spare even the strong.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-52">Man becomes god by self-restraint</p>
<p class="Text">According to Indian culture man’s view point should be high. In our culture soul has been given priority. The Hindu fundamentalists have thought over the way of life, worldly behaviour, objects and individual method of living life and the fundamental principles with the spiritual point of view. Going above trivial worldly enjoyments of pleasure and comforts, having developed spiritual feeling the priority has been given to live the life of spirituality. Keeping in view the protection of morality the recognitions have been prescribed here in our culture.</p>
<p class="Text">The Indian sages had made researach that man’s endless ambition, the achievement of happiness and peace, cannot be possible with the worldly or materialistic objects of nature, or with the satisfaction of sensuous passion or by the satisfaction of sense organs. This materialistic world stimulates our gross cravings. Constantly the longing of worldly objects is generated one after another. One sensuous desire is yet to be fulfilled when the next craving is generated. Man collects and hoards boundless riches, seeks pleasure in unrestrained sexual play and cheats others by grabbing and by the selfish means. He makes conspiracy of fraud, cheating and other different kinds of deceitful acts. He resorts to the sensuous joys, intoxications, jealousy, hostility, but never gets the lasting joy and bliss. He wastes his entire life in a sort of mirage.  But just reverse his wicked feelings are agitated more. As much as a man considers the joys of life in the outer worldly objects, so much his individual and collective life is full of dissatisfaction, thorny, mournful and miserable, uncontented and entangled one. The Hindu scholars of Truth had come to the conclusion marking this mistake that selfishness and worldly enjoyments are certainly not the source of permanent joy. The centre of our joys is the self-advancement instead of materialistic pleasure-objects. For the internal purity there are prescribed means of different kinds in order. Sacrifice, martyrdom and self-control—these are the means, which help much in the internal purity.</p>
<p class="Text">In the Indian culture, there is the rule of strict restraint of the sense organs. He who is capable of restraining his sensuous passions and sense organs, can share the performance of others service. What will he do his own good and good of the public who fails to control his own body, desires, passions, habits etc., </p>
<p class="Shlok">‘हरन्ति दोषजातानि नरमिन्द्रियकिङ्करम्।’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (Mahabharat)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The man who is slave of his sense-organs (and his instincts) is dragged away towards vices.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘बलवानिन्द्रियग्रामो विद्वांसमपि कर्षति।’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Manu. 2/215)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The sense-organs are very powerful. They forcibly carry away even the wise towards sense objects.’</p>
<p class="Text">So, the Indian culture has always appreciated the strict treatment with ownself.’ If we fail to restrain our vicious tendencies, our energy will be wasted. He is the ideal Indian who follows all these three—(Dam, Dan, Yama) control, donation, yama. Specially, control out of these three—(Dam—means, subjugation of the sense-organs) is the eternal principle of the Indian seers of Truth. Self-restraint increases spiritual lustre and manliness. ‘Dana’ is absolutely pure and superior. By adding and enhancing his powers, man becomes lustrous and free from sin by self-control. Whatever the fruits of divine rules, morality auspicious deeds or the performance of all the Yagyas are, the self-control is more important. The action of donation can not be fully purified without self-control. So, it is the ‘Dama’ only that creates the mentality of ‘Dana’ and ‘Yagya’.</p>
<p class="Text">The man who does not control himself by the subjugation of his sense organs and self-control, what is the use of his renunciation and dwelling in the forest? and what is the gain to live in a forest or in any hermitage by taking renunciation for the man who has no control on his sense organs and what is the need of living in the forest or in the hermitage abandoning his house unless he has control over his senses and his mind?</p>
<p class="Text">Wherever a man who has controlled his senses lives, the same place is forest and a great hermitage for him. He who is devoted to amiability and good conduct and who has already controlled his sense organs and who lives with simplicity of what avail are hermitages to him? The modifications are caused in the men attached to the sensuousness even in the forests and if the five sense-organs are controlled even a domestic life, is verily the penance.</p>
<p class="Text">He who is always engaged in the benevolent or good deeds, for such a detached person his home is the forest of penance. Dwelling alone in the aloofness, following the moral rules strictly and firmly and keeping away his sense organs from the worldly attachments, remains busy in the pondering  of spiritual truth is the fruit of Indian culture.</p>
<p class="Text">On one side whereas Indian culture preaches the sermon of self-restraint, on the next side insists on to be generous to others more and more. A true Indian should always remain prompt for the service, co-operation and support.</p>
<p class="Shlok">सत्यस्य वचनं श्रेय: सत्यज्ञानं तु दुष्करम््।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यद्‍भूतहितमत्यन्तमेतत् सत्यं ब्रवीम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Mahabharat)</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘To speak the truth is the most benedictory, but the knowledge of truth is very difficult. So, I consider the truth simply which is much beneficial for the beings.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">आत्मोत्कर्षं न मार्गेत परेषां परिनिन्दया।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वगुणैरेव मार्गेत विप्रकर्षं पृथग् जनात्॥</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘Never see your progress in the censure of others. He is the true Indian who wishes the evolution of other men with his own virtues. The worshipper of Indian culture are always the helpers and supporters of shelter-seeking and weakers.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">In India, there is the tradition of generosity with others. The Indian culture has been generous to even those who came here from the outside to kill them, who gave poison, who burnt in fire, who got trampled with elephants and who got bitten with snakes. We have seen the God in all. We have observed the sight of Vishnu in the elephants, in the serpents, in the water and in the fire also, then, to see God in animals and men is much more valuable. We have been of the generous nation to love all the creatures as a whole.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-53">The glory of Gayatri and Cow</p>
<p class="Text">Gayatri is the eternal and beginningless of Indian culture. It is mentioned in the Purans—</p>
<p class="Text">‘The creator of the universe, Lord Brahma had got this ‘Gayatri Mantra’ through the oracle. He had acquired the power of the creation of this world by the penance of practice of this spell. As the explanation of the four parts of Gayatri, Brahmaji described the Vedas with four faces. Gayatri is called ‘Vedmata’ the mother of Vedas. All the four Vedas are merely the exposition of Gayatri.’</p>
<p class="Text">In the 24 letters of Gayatri, the teachings of Vedas, Shastra, Puran, Smriti, Upanisad etc., have been given which can provide man the individual social and spiritual happiness and peace. In the Gita, Lord Shri Krishna has Himself said—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘गायत्री छन्दसामहम्’</span><span class="char-style-override-5"> </span>It means—‘I Myself, am the ‘Gayatri Mantra’ among the vedic hymns.</p>
<p class="Text">Gayatri is the superiormost spell of India, that is why, it is said that it bestows longevity, knowledge, son, glory, wealth and the lustre of the Brahma. By the practice of the worship of Gayatri, all the impurity distraction frozen on our spirit are washed away and the purified form of soul appears and different accomplishments and ocult powers start coming out. Just after the start of Gayatri worship the spiritual power of man increases in his inner-self and the vices are removed away. The quantity of self-restraint, modesty, zeal, smartness, labour, sweetness, honesty, truthfulness, generosity, love, contentment, peace, the spirit of service, close affinity etc., virtues begin to enhance day by day. Gayatri has been called here, the ‘Kamdhenu’ (Cow of plenty, fulfilling all desires) because it satisfies the spiritual hunger and thirst. Gayatri has been called the nectar of the earth also; because it fills us with the power to get the true nectar, having released from the wheel of birth and death. By the worship of Gayatri on the priority basis, the spiritual advancement is made, this is the chief gain. Gayatri is supporter in progressing the direction of self-redemption, happiness and peace.</p>
<p class="Text">The mother cow is the shining symbol of Indian culture. The ancient Aryans have said—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘मातेव रक्षति’</span> means ‘May this mother protect us! The Supreme Lord, Shri Krishna had shown this admirable path by the service of cow, so that we might adopt the ideal in our life. By emphasising the importance of cow mother in the ‘Rigveda’ and ‘Atharv Veda’ many useful sentences of doctorine have been said which are quoted here—</p>
<p class="Shlok">माता रुद्राणां दुहिता वसूनां </p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वसादित्यानाममृतस्य नाभि:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्र नु वाचं चिकितुषे जनाय </p>
<p class="Shlok">मा गामनागामदितिं वधिष्ट॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Rigved 8/101/15)</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘Cow is the mother of ‘Rudras’ (gods) the daughter of Vasus (demi-gods), the sister of Aditiputras and the treasure of nectar in the form of ghee. It is the duty of every thoughtful man not to kill the cow the innocent and worthy of not to be slain.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">यदि नो गां हंसि यद्यश्वं यदि पूरुषम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तं त्वा सीसेन विध्यामो यथा नोऽसो अवीरहा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved 1/16/4)</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘If you kill our cow, horse and man, I will bind you with the ball of glass, so that you may not kill my braves.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">यूयं गावो मेदयथा कृशं चिदश्रीरं चित् कृणुथा सुप्रतीकम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">भद्रं गृहं कृणुथ भद्रवाचो बृहद्वो वय उच्यते सभासु॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Atharvaved 4/21/6)</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘O the Cows! You make the man of lean and thin body hale and hearty and make handsome in appearance to the men who are empty of lustre. Not only this, you make our houses auspicious with your auspicious words. That is why, it is only your glory, sung in the gatherings.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">There are numberless gains from the cows. Considering the usefulness of cow, the Hindus have given her such a high status. For an agricultural country like India, the rearing of cow and the protection of cow is religion. The mankind as a whole will always remain indebted to the mother, cow for the numberless benefit to the human beings. The decay of the cow race is harmful for the nation and society from economic and moral both point of views. There should be the increase in efforts—to increase the number of cow-sheds in every village and city, so that the continuity of the sufficient availability of milk, ghee, fertiliser and strong bullocks may be maintained. In India rearing of cows and their protection is the ‘Sanatan Dharma’.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-54">The nectar of life</p>
<p class="Text">It is the knowledge of life which is the nectar to guide the human life to tread on the life and path free from throne. The man having the more knowledge of life and joy and sorrow, loss and gain, good and bad, sin and virtue, ups and down, proceeds onward leaving others behind and he is acknowledged as successful.</p>
<p class="Text">The knowledge of life is achieved by two ways. Man lives his own life. He commits errors of different kinds. He is punished for every error and deserves praise and appreciation for his success. He gets the experience of life on the basis of his pleasure and bitterness. On the basis of this experience he crosses the distress and adverse circumstances. Without experience, the unripe man falls down on every step and gets punishment. That experience is the total sum of life.</p>
<p class="Text">But by experience the road of getting wisdom is long and complicated. There are several men who commit mistakes again and again but even then, remain devoid of experience and fail to get its advantage. Those who go ahead only on the basis of their experience, no doubt, get its benefit but that experience is got too late after growing old. Some experiences are got within months and years. Sometimes it causes a great loss which cost is paid throughout the life, A wrong matter has its very harmful effect.</p>
<p class="Text">The second type of knowledge is got from the collection in the books, stored and saved from the ages passed and written in an attractive and pleasant style, if we remained dependent on our personal experience got in the life, half of our life may pass in understanding these experiments and useful rules and the ways and means of its practice; because every clue of life is got after a heavy cost.</p>
<p class="Text">Life is a big book. In this book each and every day is like one page. Every line gives a new mystery. But the life instead of one or two days, one or two years, is of years long. We come to know all the mysteries when our life reaches the edge of death. Then, the breaths of life don’t remain to practise these experiences conclusions valuable clues and useful rules of life in our life.</p>
<p class="Text">So, as soon as possible we get the true experiences of life, useful rules and the matters of benefit, from anywhere, we can form a higher life as soon as we begin to implement them.</p>
<p class="Text">Everyone who has written the experience of life, practises them in his life also. He proceeds onward on its basis. He takes its benefit by following which the great men had achieved repute, glory, respect and success.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">Every good book is extract of the life</p>
<p class="Text">What you consider book is not simply a motionless and lifeless object of paper. Books and monthly magazines are living commotion of life.</p>
<p class="Text">There is the divinity of experience in each and every word of the books and news magazines; there is the solution of the hardships of the ways of life, there is the coolness of the tree-shade; there is the undaunted faith and fragrant life; the fragrant flowers of heart are rejoicing and there is the golden source to make the earth heaven. The winter moon of hope is spreading the laughing light in them and the silver beams are scattered.</p>
<p class="Text">In the world of the books there are great seers and sages, the great thinkers of the world are there, the poets, writers and leaders are alive in the books. They are always ready to support, they have no consideration of day and night. Whenever and wherever we want, we may avail the company of our those preceptors and friends sitting in the books.</p>
<p class="Text">In the pages of books there is a permanently decorated living world. In this mortal world. God knows when this body, a lump of flesh and bones will be perished, but the experiences written there in the books are long undecaying.</p>
<p class="Text">In the books there are the methods to solve all the problems of the world. The books are filled with the conclusions of the profound mystries of life and are avaliable to us.</p>
<p class="Text">Believe it, the knowledge which you would get after passing fifty years of life, can be achieved by you from the good books in the beginning of life or even today or whenever you like.</p>
<p class="Text">There is the presence of scholars, thinkers and saints in the houses where the books are present. You have already kept a number of wise and learned men in your almirah.</p>
<p class="Text">In the words of sage Tiruvallavar—‘The men of letters are like fragrant flowers. Wherever they go, they carry with them the sweet fragrant joy. Everywhere they have their dwelling and everywhere their motherland is.’ </p>
<p class="Text">‘Knowledge is wealth. Other objects are negligible in its comparison. It is such a wealth, that accompanies a man even in the next births, in the generations to generations of the man, in the form of sacraments in the family.</p>
<p class="Text">The intelligence, purified by knowledge goes on ascending in the next births gradually and his life going higher reaches the consummate.</p>
<p class="Text">As much as well is dug, so much water is got, similarly, as much self-study, learning and teaching is made, so much the man becomes learned and wise.</p>
<p class="Text">What is man? What is this world? What is God, this soul and the beings—What happens of the human life after death? How can the best life be passed? These can be known only by them who have studied well seriously the books of the great thinkers, who have learnt knowledge in true sense.</p>
<p class="Text">It creates surprise, why the people are lazy in earning such a incomparable wealth?</p>
<p class="Text">Age is no bar. Study can be made at any age. A man should remain enthusiastic to get knowledge in any age even when he has become old and lying on death-bed. Knowledge is a divine property to accompany you in the births after births. Only he who is well read, has eyes really. He who has no knowledge is blind. His mind has only two pits but not eyes. It is the knowledge that has eyes.</p>
<p class="Text">Your friend might possibly leave your company, but the virtuous association of books is always open to you.</p>
<p class="Text">If the useful knowledge, got by self-study is practised in life, you can be escaped from so many foolishnesses of life very easily.</p>
<p class="Text">The thoughts, collected in the books have brought so many big revolutions in the world. It is a great mistake to think them dead one. They have great power. They are living as their authors. Just as any very effectual medicine is preserved in a bottle very carefully for the use in life, similarly a good book preserves the sole truth of the great soul-life. From the conclusions of the same life we can take the maximum benefit.</p>
<p class="Text">Remember the words of the poet, Milton—</p>
<p class="Text">‘A superior book is like the invaluable blood-drops of a great soul, which is eternal in usefulness and good guide. It consists of the best juice, the total sum of experiences for the future generation.’</p>
<p class="Text">This human life is quite rare, it is not available again and again. The experiences of this life cannot work in the next new life. It is not known whether this unobtainable life will be got in the next life or not. So, without waiting for our experiences to be ripe, we should take the maximum benefit by the self-study of these books.</p>
<p class="Text">You waste your free moments uselessly in cinema, clubs, gossips, gambling, playcards, useless talks and discussions. These means of recreations are not healthy. The means of self-study is healthy and effectual.</p>
<p class="Text">Self-study develops your hidden strength and powers and you live in the good company of highly exalted souls. They guide you the new directions to the holy thoughts and imaginations.</p>
<p class="Text">Self study should be the part of our daily life. As it has been said also—</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-55">The wonderful volume of the world which is never old</p>
<p class="Text">The most popular book of the world is—Gita. The lacs of copies of the Gita have been sold and even now, the numberless men of the world read it and consider it the most favourite. The reason behind it is that this small volume consists in brief of the gist of human knowledge, spirituality, ethics, moral duty, Vedas, Shastras. This is the most important conclusion of Mahabharat.</p>
<p class="Text">The problems of the world have always been complicated but its clue of solution is found in the Gita. There is only the need of the man who may understand it well countless number of learned men of India and foreign countries, wrote more than fifty commentaries and explanations of the Gita, hundreds of detailed and minute criticisms and comments were written. Gita was translated in a number of languages and thousands of editions were published. Rarely there would be any language in the world, in which the Gita would have not been translated. Even the foreigners have appreciated the Gita and declared it the best volume of Indian Philosophy.</p>
<p class="Text">The famous American Philosopher Emerson went to meet the English thinker and essayist, Carlayle—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Will you present me any book with your own hands? I want the gift, the most favourite to you and which has inspired you the most’, said Emerson.</p>
<p class="Text">Carlayle said—‘You want that gift which has proved to be the best guide of my life, and which has been the source of illumination and inspiration in my life.’</p>
<p class="Text">He remained pondering over for a while and remained moving before the almirah of His library fully packed with books, then, presenting a small book he said—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Please, take this book, my dearest book.’</p>
<p class="Text">Emerson took that book and saw its name—this was the translation of ‘Shrimadbhagavat Gita’ in English.</p>
<p class="Text">Carlayle said—‘This is the most favourite gift of India to the world and my dearest gift to you. This book has covered the entire spiritualism of the world, the welfare of human being as a whole and the guideline in all the situations in the form of pithy verses.’</p>
<p class="Text">Emerson said—‘This is a very small book.’</p>
<p class="Text">Carlayle said—‘Yes, this is the collection of pithy verses. This maxim is the gist of human science, knowledge and spiritualism.’ Well! Nothing more is required. Only this book is sufficient to do good and shape this world and the beautitude as well. Its message can never be old.’</p>
<p class="Text">Emerson touched the Gita with his forehead. This gift proved to be the turning point of his life and it gave a new outlook of life. Emerson has written—‘I daily bathe in the holy water of the Gita. Among the books of the present age, the Gita is the foremost. The age when it would have been written, must have been some supernatural age.’</p>
<p class="Text">Reading the Gita, the German scholar Shlegal had come to emotion. The spirituality of Gita has its very powerful influence on the thoughts of Shoupenahar and Mejani.</p>
<p class="Text">Among the Muslims, the prince of Bukhara was a great lover of spiritualism and higher life. Going beyond the narrowness of the religion, he had studied the Sanskrit language also. He was the first man among the Muslims, who had attracted the Islamic world towards the Gita.</p>
<p class="Text">Alberuni had said—‘The Gita is the better gift of knowledge to the world. In this single book the gist of all the sects of the world has been presented.’</p>
<p class="Text">It is related to the Moghal age—</p>
<p class="Text">The Emperor Akabar was the lover of knowledge. When it came to his knowledge that the ‘Shrimadbhagawat Gita’ is the total sum of Vedic religion, he ordered Faizi to translate Gita in the Persian language. Among the Muslim Emperors, whosoever read it, was charmed. Shikoha named it ‘Sirde Akabar’. This was a favourite book of Akabar. Faizi had written in the introduction of this book—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Gita is the source of spiritual bliss to the mankind. This book is the guide of the path leading to truth and is full of countless sermons unfolding the deep secrets of spiritualism. This is the creation of the foremost among men, Vyasji having the topmost knowledge, to guide the mankind about the oneness of all the spirits of the world. If is beyond my speech and pen to praise it.’</p>
<p class="Text">Really, this is not the experience of single one but of the many.</p>
<p class="Text">All the Upanishads are like the cows, the Gita is the milk of nectar and the milkman is Himself, the Lord Shri Krishna.</p>
<p class="Text">If the entire literature of India had been destroyed and merely the Gita had been left safe, even then, it was sufficient to remind the glory of Aryan race to the whole world.</p>
<p class="Text">Gita is the symbol of Indian culture. In the Vedic religion, whatever the higher thought, the fundamental truth, view points, the elements of the secret of the uplift of human life, all these are included and are found in the combined form in this gem of books only.</p>
<p class="Text">Shrimadbhagavat Gita is the spiritual volume to present the concluding gist of Vedic religion and culture. But in the present situations of the country, the Gita is specially beneficial and useful.</p>
<p class="Text">Today in the country, narrowness, small disputes, narrow outlook, the discrimination of colour, caste, class, the discrimination on the basis of religion and indifference to duty, all such mentalities have spreadover. The pit of differences between man to man is expanding fast. The country is disturbed with the mentality of fatalism, inactiveness and gloomy disorder. The entire country is in the condition of a type of cowardiceness and suffering from the inferiority complex.</p>
<p class="Text">The country is passing through an old situation of doubt and in decision even worse than the condition of Arjuna in the battlefield before the Mahabharat war had not broken out. ‘Whatever I should fight the war or not? What should be my outlook towards war?</p>
<p class="Text">The same philosophy of action and duty in the Gita that had persuaded Arjuna to be ready to fight and at last had made him winner, can make the country march ahead. This message of (Krmayoga) unselfish action given by the Gita only can make the country strong.</p>
<p class="Text">There is the message in the Gita to do the duty rising above the petty mentality of loss and gain and expectation.</p>
<p class="Text">There is the message of action in the Gita. Integrated with Sattvika and unselfish feelings is necessary. In the world <span class="char-style-override-4">‘श्रीकृष्णार्पणमस्तु’</span> ‘Surrender yourself to Shri Krishna is needed.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4"><span class="char-style-override-4">‘श्रीकृष्णार्पणमस्तु’</span> The man who has surrendered himself to God with this feeling considers that all the works are not for him, all are for the God, these are for the protection and stability of the world and that is why these are pleasing to the God. This mentality of the devotee having faith in the Gita, makes his secular actions spiritual.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-56">Surrender to the God—The inspiring ideal of Gita</p>
<p class="Text">Surrendering himself to the Lord, completely when the man offers his entire mental, intellectual and spiritual powers to the feet of the Lord, the old tendencies or instincts of the man, which were badly attached to the worldly enjoyments, now start rising up towards a new direction from downward to upward, from the materialism to divinity. For the spiritual accomplishments, he comes in contact of the divine powers. The man of self-surrender gets a new life.</p>
<p class="Text">Be self-restraint and then offer your all the actions, your powers and your desires to the Lord. Such a man, who has surrendered himself completely, has been successful in the work of the public interest.</p>
<p class="Text">To offer the entire self to the Lord, to collect the spiritual powers by becoming the Lord’s part or the servant of God’s servant. This discipline of self-purification has been continuing since the ancient time. In the Gita, the Lord has explained the function of self-purification in the following words—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तमेव शरणं गच्छ सर्वभावेन भारत।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्प्रसादात्परां शान्तिं स्थानं प्राप्स्यसि शाश्वतम्॥</p>

<p class="Text">We have nothing as our own. Whatever is, belongs to the Lord. We do nothing for ourselves but do everything for the Lord service—by doing anything with this mentality man gets the power beyond limit. That is why the poet has said truly—</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-57">Give-up the false notion of hunger</p>
<p class="Text">False hunger is that appetite, which is an artificial creation of our mind. That is hot the appetite of our stomach, but the mind remains hungry of different kinds of objects, cravings and necessities. The Brahmins of Mathura are renownsed for false hunger. As it is generally said that without hunger by overeating they were those to fall ill who took bitter medicines, remained on long fast and became well after a great trouble. So, one should remain cautious from false hunger.</p>
<p class="Text">The materialism is a type of false hunger. Just as in false hunger, there is a useless temptation and mental dissatisfaction, similarity, in the false hunger of materialism the new way of entertainment, the satisfaction of sexual mentality, desires are worthless and not true. Basically, a man does not need them. Due to ignorance, he feels their need. In its fulfilment, as much as he goes on being attached, so much with the same speed it is inflamed like the ghee in fire.</p>
<p class="Text">It is the duty of man being awakened to realize the self. The self-realization provides us the emancipation of the self—</p>
<p class="Shlok">दर्शनं ह्यात्मन: कृत्वा जानीयादात्मगौरवम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञात्वा तु तत्तदात्मानं पूर्णोन्नतिपथं नयेत्॥</p>
<p class="Text">Means—‘Let us observe the spirit, let us know the spirit, let us realize its great glory and let us tread on the path of self-evolution.’</p>
<p class="Text">We should do such noble and higher deeds that  are in harmony with the glory of the great spirit. So, the duty of everyone of us is of great responsibility. Without the spiritual behaviour, our life is like the elephant without an elephant-goad, the elephant may go astray there is none to control that elephant. The spiritualism teaches us the behaviour embodied with the spiritual virtues to others and inspires us for the higher life.</p>
<p class="Text">A spiritual man glances the same sight of self-spirit in others which is present in his own self. He goes on pouring down his love, pity, compassion and sympathy on others. The orbit of his close affinity is broad enough which includes in it not only mankind but other creatures too.</p>
<p class="Text">Spiritualism creates the real and absolutely pure hunger removing away our false hunger. It burns up all latent desires and generates Sattvika feelings, It initiates us towards purity.</p>
<p class="Text">When we give the slogan ‘Leave the false hunger!’ We want to say—‘Give up the needless and worthless artificial needs, desires, sensuous passions. The hunger of undesirable meal, the desire of fine clothes and garments, the hunger of grand houses, the luxurious life, the life of enjoyments, unrestrained powers and rights and the hunger of unlimited wealth—all such types of hunger are needless for your personality. It is improper to get entangled with them. You should remain escaped of the materialistic web of illusion and remain giving up all kinds of false hunger. Be free from false artificial life and practise the simple behaviour of simplicity.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">The false hunger is unnecessary craving and greed. So, to remain away and maintain distance from it is the only means of a successful life. It is only spiritualism that can remove it.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-58">The bliss of heaven and salvation can be experienced here</p>
<p class="Text">‘Yoga’, among six parts of Indian philosophy is a great contribution of Hindus and Indian to the world. This is quite different from the other dry thoughts of the world; because it is practical. Yoga is science in itself. If we want, we can name it ‘Eastern Psychology’ also. Those, taking interest in Indian culture give due importance to ‘Yoga’ and see it with respectful sight; because, it is full of spiritual miracles. It was the seer Patanjali to originate the Yoga. According to him, ‘Yoga’ is such a knowledge, where a man can merge himself in God by the control of mind.</p>
<p class="Text">The word ‘Yoga’ means ‘Union’ or to unite. How pleasant is the union of two separated persons? By the mutual joining with one another we become firm and strong. We feel the internal exhilaration. Our soul feels joy. Whatever the immaculate, enlightened, consciousness, sentiment, Bliss, beauty, joy, benevolence, undecaying immortal is there in the innerself of man, is the spirit. This spirit is closely related to the eternal, the substratum of all Supreme fundamental truth, the Supreme, Lord. By the means of Yoga, when this spirit unites with Supreme Spirit, we are overwhelmed with that joyous sentiment and feeling like the mental condition of the child depending on the mother’s milk, when meets her after separation. Really that joy has no simile.</p>
<p class="Text">The feeling created after the union with the Lord is to give unlimited joy and eternal peace. The joy got by the devotee by the Lord’s worship and ultimately union with Him is indescribable.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Yoga’ is that knowledge which provides us the joy of the heaven and salvation here in this world. A number of devotees shun their materialistic properties and absorb themselves in the spiritual disciplines (Yama-Niyam, Dhyan, Dharana etc.); because they give more priority to the spiritual bliss than the worldly joys. The realized souls have written their feelings of their union with the Supreme soul. So, it is necessary for the inquisitives to know and experience the miracles of Yoga to study and understand well the knowledge of Yoga with the company of great souls and learneds. Now-a-days, only to perform ‘Asana’ and ‘Pranayam’ is considered complete ‘Yoga’, but these are the sub-ordinate practices of Yoga, only for health purposes, but in real sense it is union with God through mind and soul. For the study of the science of Yoga, zeal, the attainment of virtues and long practice and the virtuous preceptor—these requirements are necessary for the practice of ‘Yoga’.</p>
<p class="Text">There are several forms of Yogas as ‘Karmyoga’, ‘Gyanyoga’, ‘Bhaktiyoga’ and ‘Rajyoga’. ‘Yama-Niyama’ are the base without which none can be inclined to the path of ‘Yoga’. The Yogi Shri Arvind has emphasised more on ‘Self-dedication’.</p>
<p class="Text">What is the practice of ‘Yoga’? In the inner-self of man, that what is the immaculate, enlightened and consciousness (Shuddha, Buddha, Chaitanya), is immortal reality God, the ‘Spirit’ mind, intellect mind, ego, all these four attached with consciousness is called embodied being. This is also apart from the Lord also not apart. It can be called as ‘Dualism’ (Dvait) and ‘Non-duality’ (Advaita) also. It is the fire that brings forth spark. The spark can be called separate from the fire; but without fire the spark is of no existence, so, this is also the part of fire, which is non-dual. The eternal Supreme Truth is fire and the soul is spark. Both are apart also and the same also. In the ‘Upanishads’, they have been compared with the two birds sitting on the same branch of tree. In the Gita accepting the existence of the both one has been called ‘perishable’ and the second ‘non-perishable’.</p>
<p class="Text">Due to misunderstanding, ignorance or illusion the both (The embodied soul and God) become separate from their eternal unity. This is the cause of sorrow and lamentation.</p>
<p class="Text">Where the embodied soul and Supreme soul are united, there, the will, inclination and the mode of action of the embodied soul all become according to the will, interest and mode of action of the Supreme soul, then there is the spontaneous overflow of immense, divine joy. In the absence of the spiritual unity, the man’s mental world remains badly disturbed and unpeaceful. The anguish of this disorder of his inner-self world remains blazing like conflagration. The materialistic means of comforts and enjoyments may be even boundless, but his inner-self remains deprived of even the least peace of mind. The master of boundless riches, the seth, capitalists, big officers remain surrounded with different worries, anxieties and anguished. It makes it clear that a man can never get the real and permanent joy or comfort of life by his property, wealth or rights and powers.</p>
<p class="Text">In the same way, there are several such men also who are empty of pelf and power and the material opulence and comforts, yet they are free from tension and they lead a carefree life. They enjoy the sound sleep of comfort and remain pleased to see the joy all around them. it makes clear that the scarcity of pelf and power and other worldly facilities does not become the cause of their lessening of joy. The worry of the rich and the happiness of the poors is its evidence that the happiness does not exist in the outwardly objects and the base of the happiness is not external.</p>
<p class="Text">In the spiritual unity, there is pleasure in the union of the both. The same can be said in the Yogic philosophy as the union of soul with the eternal Supreme Spirit. The next name of this union is ‘Yoga’. By the union of soul and the Supreme eternal truth and with the combined force of unity such a bliss is originated which is incomparable to any joy of the world. The same bliss is given the different names as Supreme bliss, deliverance of the soul, Brahma who is all peace, spiritual accomplishment the sight of the Lord, etc.</p>
<p class="Text">Basically, there is no existence of man’s mind. This is merely and instrument of the soul. There is the existence of mind only to activate the soul’s mode of action in order and by its performance to give the gross form. Its actual function is to adopt the viewpoint, thought and mode of action according to the will and interest of the soul. If the mind functions according to the proper and natural way, the human being takes the real taste of the happy life. But it is unfortunate that most of us are today devoid of this situation. The spirit is mainly the element of truth. Its will and interest is towards purity. The demand of spirit is to find the every moment of life overwhelmed with purity and every thought and action to be endowed with purity.</p>
<p class="Text">But being entangled into the web of illuson and ignorance. We are misdirected. Our mind runs after gloom and passion. By the constant encouragement to this mode of action, it becomes so mighty, that the desire and temptation of the mind gets its priority in the place of the call of soul.</p>
<p class="Text">After getting rid of this vicious mental tendency following the soul only we can get the real joy. This mode of action is called the Practice of ‘Yoga’. This practice of ‘Yoga’ should be the duty of daily routine for the striver of high properties. According to the Indian culture, the base of real joy and peace is merely the practice of Yoga. When by the means of ‘Yoga’, the man, distressed by the struggles of the world being introvert sits near the soul, he feels the boundless peace.</p>
<p class="Text">The above lines throw some light on the importance of Indian ‘Yoga-system’. The ‘Yoga’ is the psychology of eastern view. According to this, a man should attain cravings in the Supreme eternal free from all the a state of stable existence. Contrary to it the Western psychology speaks that there should no restrain on the sensuous passion. This ‘Yoga’ system of Indian Psychology is superior and better; because by this method man’s interest and mental attitude remains higher. The purify and divinity gets sufficient opportunity to develop. The first advantage of the practice of Yoga is the purity of mind and the second advantage is the concentration of mind and peace. By the constant pondering and meditation develops the concentration of mind. The spiritual forces develop. All the modern methods of Western psychology as Psychotherepy, mesmerism, thought reading, clair-voyance etc., are possible through Yoga.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">The a great need of the present is to sharpen the right outlook of ‘Yoga’—knowledge. The performance of ‘Asan’ and ‘Pranayam’ have become the entire ‘Yoga’. But the ‘inner-practice’ is more important in real sense. At the time of ‘Yoga’ the Yogis wear the skin of deer so because they used to get it available from the dead deer easily. Now-a-days, the skin of animals shot dead with the bullets of guns are available which is at all condemnable. Now there is no need of tongs The simple life like foremost ascetic, Arvind, Swami Dayanandji, Swami Shivanandji is appropriate at all.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-59">The base of real happiness and peace is this </p>
<p class="Text">‘Spiritualism’ is the view of theists while ‘materialism’ is the view of atheists. Spiritualism is related to the intutive perceptrion which, is not visible with the physical eyes, but its influence is pervasive and lasting. The spiritualist has integral faith in God. Contrary to it the materalist runs towards the object, which is visible with the physical eyes and which provides instant gain. The modern age is in illusion of worthless concept to earn more, enjoy more and expand your needs and searching for the happiness at the tragic places. His property has expanded; the boundless wealth is there in the countries like America. There is no happiness in wealth, there is dissatisfaction and mirage. There is no lack of energy in the world, varied objects of luxury and comforts are ready but there is not the least satisfaction and peace.</p>
<p class="Text">So long as any man or any nation does not has faith in God, he does not get the base of lasting and stable thought. Spiritualism provides us the strong base. Whatever the work a spiritualist takes in his hand, that work is fulfilled automatically with the divine power. The materialist wants to fulfil the work with the worldly efforts, but these works fail to give satisfaction and peace despite of being completed. The materialist looks for the gain which means good for nothing and he dies in the same. That poor does not have such a farsightedness that he may know at least that the worldly objects may vanish in a moment.</p>
<p class="Text">Why is the modern world dissatisfied? The reason behind is that the base of his thinking, understanding living and stability is temporary and momentary. If he may adopt spiritualism, he can get energy and peace.</p>
<p class="Text">The man, possessing twenty-six qualities of divine property can be called a spiritual man. These qualities are—Absolute fearlessness, perfect purity of mind, constant fixity in the Yoga of meditation for the sake of Self-realization, and even so, charity in its Sattvika form, control of the senses, worship of God and other deities as well as of one’s elders including the performance of Agnihotra (pouring oblations into the sacred fire) and other sacred duties, study and teaching of the Vedas and other sacred books as well as the chanting of God’s names and glories, suffering hardships for the discharge of one’s sacred obligations and uprightness of mind as well as of the body and senses. Non-violence in thought, word and deed, truthfulness and geniality of speech, absence of anger even on provocation, disclaiming doership in respect of actions, quietude or composure of mind, abstaining from slander, compassion towards all creatures, absence of attachment to the objects of senses even during their contact with the senses, mildness, a sense of shame in transgressing the scriptures or social conventions, and abstaining from frivolous pursuits; Sublimity, forgiveness, fortitude, external purity, bearing enmity to none and absence of self-esteem—these are, O Arjun, the marks of him, who is born with the divine endowments.</p>
<p class="Text">Contrary to it the materialistic men have the demonic traits. They are hypocrite They say something and do otherwise. Their hypocrisy is markable at every step. It is a matter of great regret that now, those who boast of being spiritualist, are mostly devoid of the qualities of divine property. They are arrogant. They don’t bow down before anybody. They remain overpowered with pride. According to the three qualities—(Sattva, Rajas, Tamas) there can be three states of pride also. All these kinds of proud are to be given up. Such men who have wrath, hard-hearted and ignorance are found in general now-a-days and actually, they are the root cause of disturbance.</p>
<p class="Text">Theism teaches us faith in the God. We should not consider the God as the human being of this world having four hands and fourlegs. God is the absolute fundamental truth. As the air is an element. The sceintists have divided the air into many sub-parts—Oxygen, Nytrogen etc., and every part will be called ‘Air’ basically. Similarily, a single essence, which is pervading everywhere, which exists in the innerself of everyone and which interpenetrate all, is Supreme Lord. That spirit is everywhere, all pervading. Spiritual truth is the greatest achievement of our saints and seers. This essence has three forms—</p>
<p class="Text">1. The creator, 2. the sustainer, 3. the destroyer. All three powers are prevalent by three names in Indian culture—Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. All these three are apparant. None can deny them.</p>
<p class="Text">Today, we are in a great need of spiritualism. The enjoyment can not pacify the lust of the enjoyment of worldly objects rather than it intensifies more. It is only the feeling of sacrifice and self-restraint that purifies our mind and the wit is purified by knowledge. It is only the master of his senses who can get salvation. The man attached to worldly objects faces evil destiny.</p>
<p class="Text">Self-discipline is better than the control thrust upon by others. Our soul’s voice can inspire us to the path of truth. The earth exists unmoved only because of truth. It is only truth why the sun is blazing and only due to the existence of truth the air is in motion. Everything is constant due to truth only. We should remain always prompt to hold on truth and give up vices.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">This human life is not meant for the momentary enjoyment of the sensual objects. The sole duty and the sole purpose of human life is self-realization.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-60">Yes, my age is not eighty, only four years</p>
<p class="Text">The king Nausherva was going somewhere. He remained fond of knowing any new thing by having conversation with others. By chance, on the way, a white bearded man met him. The old man was of religious mind. Both of them came close to each other. Now the course of discussion started.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the question arose what should be the subject of discussion? Whether politics, arms and weapons, religion, philosophy—ultimately what should be the subject in talk, what subject will interest this old man?</p>
<p class="Text">In the course of thinking, the king, Nausherva asked the old man to start the converstation—‘O the old gentle man! What is your age?’</p>
<p class="Text">The old man was old enough with completely white hair, mouth toothless, wrinkled face, the eyes were down in pit. His waist was bent, the body limbs were shaking and body shivering! The old remained silent for sometime. Then, he answered seriously—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Sir, I am only four years old.’</p>
<p class="Text">This answer was somewhat strange. This old man, at the edge of death and his age simply four years! What a wonderful version! What a white lie! It could never be believed. The king got furiated but suppressing his anger, said with showy respect—</p>
<p class="Text">‘In this old age such a lie! Bare Minya! Why are you assuming air? Your this exhausted condition, your shaking body, these white hair like milk, are clearly certifying your age not less than eighty years in any condition. Don’t place a riddle. Tell how far I am true in my presumption? My presumption about age can never be wrong as I think.</p>
<p class="Text">The old man was looking somewhat astonished and afraid. He was unable to speak any word for a while. He could not make the answer clear.</p>
<p class="Text">The king again asked—‘Repeat your words again, I could not really understand.’</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the old man became a bit hot and said with the motive to make himself clear—‘Sir, I speak the truth. Really, I am only four years old.’</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the king became serious and began to think—‘His words seems to be some what profound.’</p>
<p class="Text">Said—‘Bare Miyan! Make your words clear.’</p>
<p class="Text">The old man said—‘Sir, your presumption is not wrong. Really the matter is so, that I have wasted seventy-six years uselessly.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Have wasted!’ How can it be possible so? Have you not fed yourself and your family?’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Sir, I have wasted these 76 years only in doing such works. I caused the children born. Then, I remained engaged in bringing them up, then supporting them to get any job and getting them married. I remained in the false notion of realizing my main duty to nourish my children and myself till the aged 76 and I did nothing else.’</p>
<p class="Text">The king said—‘Then how do you say these years to be wasted?’</p>
<p class="Text">‘I do consider them wasted. In this long duration of life, I earned neither any virtue nor helped any poor nor did any work of welfare. I remained living the life of a beast. My valuable time passed away in eating and drinking.</p>
<p class="Text">‘For the last four years, I have come to realize that in this long and broad world where as there are living numberless distressed men and pitable creatures, we are not born only for self-gratification but the others have also their right on us. It is our duty to do some good to them, offer our services to them and do some works of welfare.’ By the means of our knowledge or capital, power or intelligences, by our mind and body we have to lift them up and give them some support to progress ahead. The superiority of a man is there when he keeps his family limited and remains satisfied with limited resources and when he takes the benefit of self satisfaction and self happiness by helping and supporting others also who are in great distress, scarcity trouble and depressed. To express pleasure in the happiness of others and offer whole-hearted greetings and wishes to them is one of the most important part of social traits. The civilization and literatures also ordain it that the man is born to do good to others. He should always help and serve to the best of his capacity to those inferior to them, destitutes, helpless, weak, patients, running in scarcity, disappointed persons. This sense has prevailed in me for the last four years. So, I consider my real age as four years only.’</p>
<p class="Text">Hearing these words of the old man, Nausherwa became thoughtful. He realized that he himself is also guilty from this point of view and he had also not started yet to live in real sense.</p>
<p class="Text">A man may be at the top of richness, health, learning, well off and satisfaction, but all these can provide him only the materialistic means and comforts. He can fulfil his own interest as well as the family interest, This sphere is very limited. All animals seek their own welfare and welfare of their family but that is not the man’s human life. To produce more children and pass the whole life only in bringing up and feeding them is not a better life than an animal-life.</p>
<p class="Text">It is not the sign of prudence to use the entire competence and talent only in earning and spending in own interest. If we continue sacrificing in the public interest and in the service of the people and the world being for their moral uplift, shaping ourselves pious more and more. We can create a heaven on this earth—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्तु सर्वाणि भूतान्यात्मन्येवानुपश्यति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतेषु चात्मानं ततो न विजुगुप्सते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Rigved 40/6)</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">It means—‘He who considers the sorrow-joy and loss-gain of all the beings with such an angle as if his own sorrow and joy, gets rid of all the suspicions and doubts. He serves all the beings perceiving God in all. Really, his life is blessed and praise-worthy who works for the uplift of the society taking it the form of the Almighty God.’<span></span></p>
