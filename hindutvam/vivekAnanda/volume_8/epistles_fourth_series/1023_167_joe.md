## CLXVII

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

1719 TURK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO,  
*30th March, 1900*.

MY DEAR JOE,

Many thanks for the prompt sending of the books. They will sell quick, I
believe. You have become worse than me in changing your plans, I see. I
wonder why I have not got any *Awakened India* yet. My mail is getting
so knocked about, I am afraid.

I am working hard — making some money — and am getting better in health.
Work morning and evening, go to bed at 12 p.m. after a heavy supper! —
and trudge all over the town! And get better too!

So Mrs. Milton is there, give her my love, will you? Has not
Turiyananda's leg got all right?

I have sent Margot's letter to Mrs. Bull as she wanted. I am so happy to
learn of Mrs. Leggett's gift to her. Things have got to come round;
anyway, they are bound to, because nothing is eternal.

I will be a week or two more here if I find it paying, then go to a
place near by called Stockton and then — I don't know. Things are going
anyhow.

I am very peaceful and quiet, and things are going anyway-just they go.
With all love,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. Miss Waldo is just the person to undertake editing *Karma-Yoga* with
additions etc.

V.
