title = "The asura"

+++
R was telling me how she was reviving her saMskR^ita by reading the
harivaMsha that I had given. R being like the proverbial hidden Rustam
of the Iranians, can show a sharp eye. She was struck by a name of
varuNa, i.e. prachetas, in the harivaMsha and was discussing its
provenance with me. amarasiMha gives a name of varuNa as prachetas.
kAlidAsa following paurANic tradition in the shakuntalA (if I recall
right) calls him prachetas and this name is mentioned by all major vedic
commentators like UvaTa, sAyaNa and mahIdhara of mantra-mahodadhi fame.
prachetas might have two meanings: wise or ever-alert. Both of which are
applicable to varuNa as he is described in the R^igveda. This reminded
me of the R^igvedic mantra of shunaHshepa Ajigarti: “kShyan-nasaMbhyaM
asura prachetAH” (RV1.24.14); here he is called the asura prachetas-
which captures the semantics of his Iranian cognate exactly: ahura
mazdhA (the wise ahura). This phrase also occurs again in RV 8.90.6
which seems to refer to varuNa as the asura who is prachetasa. This
suggests that just as mAzdhA (cognate of medhira in Vedic, an adjective
applied to varuNa) was used in the Iranian world, prachetas was the
preferred cognate of this form of the name in the Indo-Aryan world.

We also encounter a similar term in RV 8.42.1 “astabhnAd dyAm asuro
vishvavedA”, where varuNa is called asuro vishvavedas- the all knowing
asura.
