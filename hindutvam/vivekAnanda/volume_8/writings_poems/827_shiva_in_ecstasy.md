## SHIVA IN ECSTASY

(Translated from a Bengali song.)

Shiva is dancing, lost in the ecstasy of Self, sounding his  
        own cheeks.  
His tabor is playing and the garland of skulls is swinging  
        in rhythm.  
The waters of the Ganga are roaring among his matted  
        locks.  
The great trident is vomiting fire, and the moon on his  
        forehead is fiercely flaming.
