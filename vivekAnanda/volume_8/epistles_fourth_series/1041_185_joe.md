## CLXXXV

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

102 E. 58TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,  
*20th July, 1900*.

DEAR JOE,

Possibly before this reaches you I shall be in Europe, London or Paris
as the chance of steamer comes.

I have straightened out my business here. The works are at Mr.
Whitmarsh's suggestion in the hands of Miss Waldo.

I have to get the passage and sail. Mother knows the rest.

My *intimate* friend did not materialise yet and writes she will come
some time in August, and she is dying to see a Hindu, and her soul is
burning for Mother India.

I wrote her I may see her in London. Mother knows again. Mrs. Huntington
sends love to Margot and expects to hear from her if she is not too busy
with her scientific exhibits.

With all love to "sacred cow" of India, to yourself, to the Leggetts, to
Miss (what's her name?), the American rubber plant.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
