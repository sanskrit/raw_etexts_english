I had recently taken my clansmen to the zoo where I came face to face
with the seriema. It was a tremendous experience. For years we had only
heard of this bird – the last representative of a great radiation of
extraordinary birds from the Americas. We made eye contact with the
seriema – we felt like being in a special presence. For the first time
we felt we were seeing all the long gone glorious phorusrhacids in flesh
and blood through the vision of that seriema before us. For a student of
evolution some organisms truly produce what is closest to the experience
of brahman as Hindus would say. R told me that she felt like using
almost the identical language when she saw the seriema many years before
me (I think she said it was like the experience of the khechari vidyA –
in time I guess).
