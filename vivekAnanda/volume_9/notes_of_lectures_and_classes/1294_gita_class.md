## GITA CLASS

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 6, pp. 275-76.)

*\[Sister Nivedita's notes of a New York Bhagavad-Gitâ class, recorded
in a June 16, 1900 letter to Miss Josephine MacLeod\]*

This morning the lesson on the Gitâ was grand. It began with a long talk
on the fact that the highest ideals are not for all. Non-resistance is
*not* for the man who thinks the replacing of the maggot in the wound by
the leprous saint with "Eat, Brother!" disgusting and horrible.
Non-resistance is practised by a mother's love towards an angry child.
It is a travesty in the mouth of a coward, or in the face of a lion.

Let us be true. Nine-tenths of our life's energy is spent in trying to
make people *think* us that which we are not. That energy would be more
rightly spent in *becoming* that which we would like to be. And so it
went — beginning with the salutation to an incarnation:

Salutation to thee — the Guru of the universe,  
Whose footstool is worshipped by the gods.  
Thou one unbroken Soul,  
Physician of the world's diseases.  
Guru of even the gods,  
To thee our salutation.  
Thee we salute. Thee we salute. Thee we salute.  
In the Indian tones — by Swami himself.

There was an implication throughout the talk that Christ and Buddha were
inferior to Krishna — in the grasp of problems — inasmuch as they
preached the highest ethics as a world path, whereas Krishna saw the
right of the *whole*, in all its parts — to its own differing ideals.
