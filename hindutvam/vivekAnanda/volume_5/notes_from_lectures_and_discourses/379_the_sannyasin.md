## THE SANNYASIN

In explanation of the term Sannyâsin, the Swami in the course of one of
his lectures in Boston said:

When a man has fulfilled the duties and obligations of that stage of
life in which he is born, and his aspirations lead him to seek a
spiritual life and to abandon altogether the worldly pursuits of
possession, fame, or power, when, by the growth of insight into the
nature of the world, he sees its impermanence, its strife, its misery,
and the paltry nature of its prizes, and turns away from all these —
then he seeks the True, the Eternal Love, the Refuge. He makes complete
renunciation (Sannyâsa) of all worldly position, property, and name, and
wanders forth into the world to live a life of self-sacrifice and to
persistently seek spiritual knowledge, striving to excel in love and
compassion and to acquire lasting insight. Gaining these pearls of
wisdom by years of meditation, discipline, and inquiry, he in his turn
becomes a teacher and hands on to disciples, lay or professed, who may
seek them from him, all that he can of wisdom and beneficence.

A Sannyasin cannot belong to any religion, for his is a life of
independent thought, which draws from all religions; his is a life of
realisation, not merely of theory or belief, much less of dogma.
