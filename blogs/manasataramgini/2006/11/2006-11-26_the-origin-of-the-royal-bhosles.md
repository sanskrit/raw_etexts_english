## Intro
The problem of the origin of the royal Bhosles, or the clan of Shivaji
the reviver of Hindu fortunes, has interested me at various points due
to a variety of reasons. I had come across the notorious stone
inscription in Thanjavur that gave a peculiar genealogy that did not
match any other genealogy from Maharashtra. 

## shUdra → kShatriya
During my peregrinations in
the Maharatta country I came across tribal Bhosles who were
cattle-herders, and many other tribal groups bearing traditionally
Maharatta last names- e.g. the Shinde, the Holkar and the Gaikavad.
There is evidence that these later Maharatta princes were originally
shUdras who attained royal status due their military distinction. So
given the Thanjavur inscription, I did not find it impossible if the
royal Bhosles were also shUdras who attained royal status as the latter
Maharatta princes had done.
 
Per say, this phenomenon was pretty
widespread: In Andhra, in the years of the great struggle, we have the
Kamma and Reddi shUdras attain royal status as a consequence of their
valiant struggle against the Moslems \[Though there are other lines of
evidence that they were originally kShatriya-s who were merely
reassuming their lost status\]. 

In support of such origins for the
Bhosles we have the statement of Jadhavrao the father-in-law of Shahji.
When Shahji’s father, Maloji, asked him for his daughter’s had he
refused initially citing his higher status as result of his descent from
the yAdava clan who were originally rulers of Maharashtra before the
Islamic deluge. The name bhosle is variously hyper-sanskritized:
paramAnanda makes it bR^iShabala. A smArta eulogist from Thanjavur made
it bhAsvata-kula. This suggests that it probably did not really have a
Sanskrit original.

## rAjpUt descent assertions
Yet, we have many assertions to the contrary claiming royal Bhosles to
be a Rajputs of the Sisodia dynasty. This idea greatly fascinated me,
because it would mean that many primary Hindu heroes of medieval times
had a common origin- linking the Ranas Hammir, Kumbha, Sanga and Pratap
with Shivaji – a pretty remarkable thing if true. So what are the points
that support the Rajput origins of Shivaji?  

- 1\) shiva-bhArata of paramAnanda: Shivaji and Shahji are of the ikShvAku
lineage like the Sisodias  
- 2\) parnAla-parvata-grahaNAkhyAna: Shivaji is a Sisodia  
- 3\) Bhushan the Hindi poet states the same.  
- 4\) Shahji in his letter to the Sultan Adilshah states he is a Rajput.  
- 5\) Islamic raconteur Khafi Khan describes Shivaji as a descendent of
the Ranas of Chittor.  
- 6\) rAdhA-mAdhava-vilAsa-champu of kavi jayarAma (\~1654 CE) describes
Shivaji as descending from the Sisodias of Chittor.  
- 7\) An intelligence dispatch of the East India company from 28th Nov
1659 reports: “Sevagy, a great Rashpoote issues forth from his fort
Rayguhr to strike blows on the Emperor, Duccan, Golconda and the
Portuguese.”  
- 8\) Tod and Ojha who had access to the Rajput records claimed that they
apparently mention the Bhosles descending from Ajay Singh, the uncle of
Vir Hammir.  

The proponents of the Rajput theory mention that after Lakshman Singh
and Ari Singh died fighting Khalji, the Rajputs fled to the Aravalis.
Here, Ajay Singh brought up Vir Hammir the son of his brother Ari Singh.
When Ajay Singh faithfully handed the throne to Hammir, his sons were
furious and fled to the Deccan. One of them Sajjan Singh then founded
the Bhosle clan in Maharashtra. In Rajasthan, Vir Hammir liberated Mewar
from the Moslems after defeating them in many battles.

The following are the main dynastic accounts given for Shivaji (names
phonetically rendered):  

Kolhapur Royal chronicles:  
lakshmaNa siMha → sajjana siMha (reaches Maharashtra in 1310 AD) →
dilIpa siMha → shivAjI-I → bhosAjI → devaraj-jI → ugrasena →
mahulAjI → khelojI → janako-jI → sambhAjI → bAbAjI → mAlojI
→ shahAji → shivajI Chatrapati

As per Tod’s account from Rajput chronicles:  
ajaya siMha → sajjana siMha → dilIpa siMha → shivAjI-I → bhorAjI
→ devaraj-jI → ugrasena → mahUljI→ khailujI → janako-jI →
sattujI → sambhAjI → shivajI Chatrapati

Satara Museum chronicles:  
lakshmaNa siMha → sajjana siMha (reaches Maharashtra in 1310 AD) →
dilIpa siMha → siMhajI-I → bhosAjI → devaraj-jI (came to south
India) indrasen-jI → shubhakR^iShNa → rUpAjI → bhumIndra-jI →
dhApAjI → barbaTjI → khelojI → jaya-karNa → sambhAjI→ bAbAjI
→ mAlojI → shahAji → shivajI Chatrapati

Thanjavur stone inscription:  
yekojI → sharabhojI (came to south India) → mahAsena → ekashiva
→ rAmachandra → bhImarAya → ekojI → varAha → ekojI II →
brahmAjI → shahAjI → ambAjI → parasojI → bAbAjI → mAlojI →
shahAji → ekojI or vyAnkojI (First Maharatta king of Thanjavur)

The Jintikars of Gwalior give the following genealogy:  
bakhtAjI (came to south India from north) → nAgojI → ekojI/vyAnkojI
→ bAbAjI → mAlojI → shahAjI → sambhAjI (elder brother of
shivAjI) → umAjI → parsojI (may not be real son) → jinTikar
bhosles

From royal Rajput documents with seals, termed sanads one can confirm
the following:  
lakshmaNa siMha → ajaya siMha → sajjana siMha → dilIpa siMha →
sidhoji → bhairoji (bhosAjI?) → devaraj-jI → ugrasena →
shubakR^iShNa

All reliable Maharatta accounts confirm:  
bAbAjI → mAlojI → shahAji → shivajI Chatrapati

The connection between the two is the major un-answered question. One
might notice that most non-Shivaji lineages of Bhosles match with the
Shivaji lineage’s claims only starting from Babaji Bhosle the Patil of
Verul, associated with the shiva temple of ghR^iShneshvara. Hence it
might be posited that the Sisodia connection is fictitious. The
opponents of the Sisodia theory state that Gagabhatta, the great brahmin
scholar of from Kashi, created this genealogy to legitimize Shivaji as a
kShatriya and give him the yaGYopavIta and savitrI.

## nAgpur branch
But there is another important point in this connection – the origin of
the royal Bhosles of Nagpur who rose to power under their brave leader
Raghuji, whose wife had an insatiable taste for French wine. The royal
Bhosles of Nagpur too claimed a Sisodia origin from Sajjan Singh. But
they had definitely branched off from Shivaji’s line before Babaji
Bhosle, and so we are already in the murky zone. 

The piece of evidence
linking them Shivaji comes from a tale related to his death. Since
Shambaji was under detention during Shivaji’s death and for reasons that
are unclear Rajaram was also not around, Sabaji Bhosle an ancestor of
the royal Nagpur Bhosle performed the funerary rites. Shahu also briefly
considered appointing the Nagpur Bhosle as his successor because he
lacked a son, but eventually chose Rajaram’s descendent as his
successor, being a closer relative. This suggests that the royal Bhosle
clans did consider each other related. Another Maharatta clan, the
Ghorpades, also claim descent from the same Sisodia lineage and declare
themselves as the elder line to the Bhosles. It is possible that their
claim is a bit more solid.

## Herder of royal origins
Recently, there has been a new theory that tries to ingeniously combine
the cattle-herder origins with royal origins. This theory derived in
part from the book “shikhar shingaNapUrchA shambhu mahAraj” in the
Maharatti language has the following elements: 1) Bhosle is
etymologically related to Hoysala. The Hoysalas were old rulers of
Karnataka and Tamilnad, and parts of what is now Maharashtra. 2) A
chieftain of the Hoysala family baliyappA gopati, the grandson of
mahabhillama was the ancestor of Shivaji. He was a major cattle-herder
with numerous herds and built a temple for mallikArjuna in
Shikhar-Shinganapur.

The Bhosle surname was taken up by his descendants
or herders unrelated to him but in his payroll. It was common even in
the north for servants to take the surnames of Rajput masters. The royal
Bhosles are direct descendents of baliyappA gopati, while the tribal
ones might be those of his erstwhile herders. In support of this it is
notable the mallikArjuna was a very important shrine for Shivaji, and he
spent a while performing rites there. His brother Ekoji/Vyankoji built
the Malleshvaram temple in Bangalore again for the same form of shiva.
The li\~Nga of ghR^iShneshvara also seems to be a representative of
mallikArjuna.

Even today Shikhar-Shinganapur is a major temple for Maharatti
pastoralists and it had several vIra-kals in the vicinity that depict
carvings of fallen cattle-raiders, similar to those of the Tamil poems,
and women worshiping rudra.
