## LXXXII

*To Mrs. Charles (Mary) Funke*

228 W. 39  
NEW YORK,

*the 6th Jan. 1896*.

DEAR MRS. FUNKEY \[FUNKE\] —

Many, many thanks for the sweet flowers. It recalls to me the beautiful
times we had at the Thousand Islands and presages many such summer
gatherings.

The work here had begun in right earnest, and we will advance it farther
this year than in the last.

I am therefore uncertain as to the exact date of my coming to Detroit. I
will come, however, very soon.

Yours ever in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA
