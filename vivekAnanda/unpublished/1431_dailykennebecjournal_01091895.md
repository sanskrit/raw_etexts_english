### (*Daily Kennebec Journal* January 9, 1895)

... Swami Vivekanenda, the Hindoo monk, who is now lecturing in this
country, has a calm pleasant face lit up with large and brilliant eyes.
He lived in the Himalayas for some time, where he claims he acquired
calmness of mind. He is said to be a wonderful combination of religious
orthodoxy and social radicalism, western scholarship and eastern
spiritual wisdom.
