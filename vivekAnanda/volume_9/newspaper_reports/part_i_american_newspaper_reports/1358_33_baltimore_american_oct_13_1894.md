## A HIGH PRIEST OF INDIA

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 2, pp. 191-192.)

\[*Baltimore American*, October 13, 1894\]

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA ARRIVES IN BALTIMORE

HIS VIEWS ON RELIGION

Swami Vivekananda, a Brahmin high priest of India, arrived in Baltimore
last night, and is the guest of Rev. Walter Vrooman. . . .

To an American reporter last night Swami Vivekananda said:

I have been very favorably impressed with American institutions during
my stay in this country. My time has been divided between four cities —
Chicago, New York, Boston and Detroit. I never heard of Chicago when in
India, but I had frequently heard of Baltimore. The main criticism I
have to pass on America is that you have too little religion here. In
India they have too much. I think the world would be better if some of
India's surplus of religion could be sent over here, while it would be
to India's profit if its people could have some of America's industrial
advancement and civilization. I am a believer in all religions. I think
there is truth in my religion; I think there is truth in your religion.
It is the same truth in all religions applying itself through various
channels to the same end. I think the great need of the world is less
law, and more godly men and women. . . .
