## ON JNANA-YOGA

First, meditation should be of a negative nature. Think away everything.
Analyse everything that comes in the mind by the sheer action of the
will.

Next, assert what we really are — existence, knowledge and bliss —
being, knowing, and loving.

Meditation is the means of unification of the subject and object.
Meditate:

Above, it is full of me; below, it is full of me; in the middle, it is
full of me. I am in all beings, and all beings are in me. Om Tat Sat, I
am It. I am existence above mind. I am the one Spirit of the universe. I
am neither pleasure nor pain.

The body drinks, eats, and so on. I am not the body. I am not mind. I am
He.

I am the witness. I look on. When health comes I am the witness When
disease comes I am the witness.

I am Existence, Knowledge, Bliss.

I am the essence and nectar of knowledge. Through eternity I change not.
I am calm, resplendent, and unchanging.
