## A PRAYER MEETING

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 1, p. 207.)

\[*Des Moines Daily News*, November 30, 1893\]

Vivekananda attended a prayer meeting Wednesday evening and witnessed
the baptism of two young women. The service impressed him very much. He
said:

I see. The sentiment is ennobling and the ceremony beautiful. It is the
more impressive that the minister is honest, earnest and believes what
he says.
