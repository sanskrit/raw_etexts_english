title = "rAmAnujAchArya’s encounter with the chera magicians"

+++
A chera magician, who was well-versed in the bhUta and bhairava tantras
had mentioned that his spells were often unable to penetrate anywhere
near the vicinity of the anantapadmanAbha temple in the chera country.

Regarding this temple, one of my reliable sources offered a curious
tale, though I have been unable to recover it from any other source.
rAmAnuja, the arch-advocate of the qualified-advaita had gone to the
regions of anantapadmanAbhA temple. After observing the rituals he was
unhappy with the use of rites of obscure tantric provenance, which did
not adhere to the mainstream pA\~ncharAtra texts. rAmAnuja and his band
sought to bring the temple ritual to conform to the pA\~ncharAtra norms.
So rAmAnuja assembled learned scholars from Kashmir and the Dravida
country to counter the chera magicians at the temple, and he was sure of
victory. The cheras were not happy with the proceedings are said to have
invoked a band of mighty cheTakas that is said to have lifted the entire
party during the night even as they were sleeping and cast them away
somewhere. When they woke up they were shocked to see that they were
lying in the outskirts of Kanchi. Never again did rAmAnuja visit the
shrine after that.
