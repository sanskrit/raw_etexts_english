The above are from the deposits of a tributary of the mUlaka-gomUtraka
(modern Mula-Mutha) that we picked up near Bhuleshvara:  
Row 1- recent and sub-fossil shells, and pebbles from the deposit
bearing the microliths  
Row 2- flint cores.  
Row 3- fragments of agate microliths.  
Row 4- flakes produced during microlith manufacture.  
These blades appear to have been used with wooden hafts and
stylistically belong to the middle of the temporal range of microlith
manufacture which appears in India even before 30k years and continues
as a background within chalcolithic sites of the Daimabad/Jorwe
cultures. From a brief prospecting I hold these deposits contain a lower
bound of 20 blades per cubic meter of deposit – these fellows were
enormously productive.
