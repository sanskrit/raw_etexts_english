PUBLISHER'S NOTE 
This is the last work of Veer Savarkarji which he oompleted during his illness and old age. After its Marathi and Hindi editions have been Circulated, we feel it a matter of profound pleasure and pride to offer to the public the English version of the book. How far the book has been popular can easily be seen from the fact that its Hindi and JUarathi editions have been published repeatedly. 
The author wanted to translate this voluminous work into English himself, but he could not do so because of his failing health. His world famous book, The Indian War of Inde­ pendence, 1857 was translated into English from the original Marathi by his several patriot colleagues, but the final touch given to the book was of the author himself. He wrote Hindutva and Hindu-Pad-Padashahi originally in English, 
Savarkar was a writer of great eminence in Marathi, Besides the charm of language, there is a striking originality in his writings, and thought is paramount. Hence the neces­ sity of making his work available in other languages arises invariably. But translation, they say, is like a faithless mistress. The charm of the original goes. The learned 
•translator, his labour tempered with devotion, has, however, tried to give his best. 
Shri S.T. Godbole has not translated the book in the customary way. The scores of books (given in the Appendix) which he has quoted in support of the assertions made by the author while, on the one hand, lend authenticity to the book, they, on the other hand, show the colossal labour put in by him in the project. We are extremely thankful to him. 
Savarkar saw the panorama of Indian history in the rise and fall of the Hindus. This concept of history moulded his political thinking and career. How far he has been success­ ful in presenting his point of view is left to the discerning reader. 
A Word In Confidence 
It is with great pleasure and satisfaction that I present to the readers this translation of the original book in Marathi. I consider it a piece of good luck to have had an opportunity of translating such an important book by the late Swantantrya-Veer V. D. Savarkar, which cropped up in. my casual talk with Shree Balarao Savarkar, the devoted private secretary of that Prince of Patriots. After it was- translated every chapter went to the illustrious author who honoured me by going through it very carefully and when I had the good fortune to meet him personally on the comple­ tion of the undertaking, he obliged me by saying that he was satisfied with the translation and appreciated the hard labour it entailed. Would that Swa. Veer Savarkar had been aliv& today to see this English translation of his book in print ! 
Veer Savarkar's book, "*in?ftq ^fafRRnoT gfl is a commentary—not a history in its academic sense—on the significant events and periods in our national life, taking a. broad survey of the growth and survival of our Hindu race. In a way this attempt of Savarkar has been singular, barring a few honourable exceptions. 
The general trend of the Histories, written, read and taught in schools and colleges has been one of eulogizing the foreigners and deprecating the Hindu race, relying wholly on the biased records of the foreign historians and travellers,. Attempts are, happily, being made to reconstruct and restate the history of India from the national point of view,^ using to the utmost all available native records of coins and inscriptions and covert allusions in the otherwise non-histo­ rical works, slender though Ihey may be ; but they are still sporadic and isolated, relating to this or that particular phase of Indian History. This volume presents 'Six Glorious Epochs of Indian History' since the beginning of our recorded history i.e. from the days of Chandragupta. 
Maurya to the end of the British dominance over India. Hence, like its predecessor, 'The War of Indian Independence 
•of 1857', which galvanized the public opinion and changed the world outlook on that phase of our national life, this book too is very likely to start re-orientation of our histori­ cal concepts and the accepted historical theories. A need for an English translation of this book was, therefore, sorely felt with a view to introducing it to the people who are unable to read or understand Marathi. 
A book of this type had to be substantiated with proofs, especially when it was replete with thought-provoking—even -at times shocking—statements and conclusions. Basic refer­ ences were, therefore, an unavoidable necessity ; but the author, who had already crossed the bar of eighty years, and whose physical ailments had already created insurmountable diflSculties in the very writing of this book, could not be expected to stand the rigour of pin-pointing his references, voluminous as they were. I, therefore, had to shoulder that responsibility. The appendage of the basic references to this volume is thus my humble contribution. They will clearly show to the reader that the facts mentioned in this volume are fully backed by evidence. The interpretation of these facts and the conclusions drawn from them, however, are the author's special privileges, if only they obey the laws of logical reasoning. The chapters are numbered serially from one to twenty-three. Each paragraph is serially numbered at the beginning, while the figures in the body of the para­ graphs indicate the reference number. In preparing the index, reference is made to the paragraphs and not to the pages. My thanks are due to my son, Shri P.S. Godbole for going through the type written sheets and preparing the Index. I am thankful to Shri B.D. Velankar, the Asiatic Society of Bombay and the University of Bombay for library facilities. I am also thankful to the publishers who have brought out this book.

CHAPTER 1 
CHANDRAGUPTA—CHANAKYA I 
1. According to modern historical research, the first phase of the dawn of our national life dates back almost from five to ten thousand years ago^. Like that of China,. Babylon, Greece and other ancient nations our ancient his­ tory, too, is clothed in the poetical garb of mythology. It is replete with anecdotes, folk-lore, and deification of national heroes and heroines, and resorts to supernatural and symbolic description. Yet these ancient mythologies (Puranas) of ours are the pillars supporting the edifice of our ancient history*. Just as these extensive Puranic texts of ours are a magni­ ficent treasure of our ancient literature, our knowledge, our glorious deeds and our grandeur and wealth, in a similar way they are a vast store-house of the accounts of our past, desul­ tory, chaotic, even at times, ambiguous though it may be. 
2. Our 'Puranas, however, are not 'history' pure and unadulterated'. 
3. Hence, I propose to set aside the consideration of the 'Pauranic times' in the present context. For the 'Glorious 
The number indicate reference to the book given in the Appendix. 
2 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Epochs', that I am going to refer to, and dilate upon, belong 
not so much to the Pauranic times, as to the historic periods 
of our national life. 
THE BEGINNING OF INDIAN HISTORY 
4. The main criterion of history is that the dates and 
places and descriptions of events referred to therein must 
necessarily bear the stamp of authenticity, and they should 
be corroborated, as far as possible, by foreign as well as 
indigenous evidence. 
6. The account of our past which fairly stands this test 
begins approximately from the time of Lord Buddha. Hence 
many Indian and Western Orientalists have accepted the 
Buddhist period as the beginning of Indian history*. The 
incessant and indefatigable labours of these Orientalists may 
in future include some of the so-called 'Pauranic period' into 
the historical one if some new evidence were to come to light. 
Till then at least we have to regard the Buddhistic period as 
the starting point of our history. 
6. Again, in respect of establishing the authentic history 
of any nation beyond doubt, the convincing references in the 
contemporary literature of other nations are really invalu­ 
able. The ancient period of our history which can be suppor­ 
ted by the now available, unimpeachable evidence in the 
historical records of countries other than India is the one 
which begins round about the times of Emperor Chandragupta 
Mourya^. For, since the date of Alexander's so-called invasion 
of India numerous references to events in India are to be 
found in the historical accounts of the Greek writers and the 
description of their travels by the Chinese travellers. 
7. What should be the criterion for determining the 
Glorious Epochs, I am going to discuss here. For that matter 
there are hundreds of glorious epochs in the history of our 
nation which stand the tests of poetic exuberance, music, 
prowess, affluence, the height of philosophy and depth of theo­ 
logy and many other criteria. But by the 'Glorious Epoch' 3 ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 3 
T mean the one from the history of that warlike generation 
•and the brave leaders and successful warriors who inspire 
and lead it on to a war of liberation in order to free their 
nation from the shackles of foreign domination, whenever it 
has the misfortune to fall a prey to such powerful fatal 
aggression and to grovel abjectly under it, and who ulti­ 
mately drive away the enemy making it an absolutely free 
and sovereign nation. Every nation extols such epochs of the 
wars of independence which inflict crushing defeats on the 
enemy. Take for instance, the American War of Indepen­ 
dence. The day on which America wrenched her indepen­ 
dence from England, vanquishing her completely on the 
battlefield, is a red-letter day in the history of America and 
is celebrated like a festival all over the country. The moment 
recording this successful struggle for freedom is acknowledged 
as a glorious epoch in the history of America. 
GREAT NATIONS AND THE CALAMITY 
OF FOREIGN DOMINATION 
8. Moreover, the birth of the United States of America, 
is only of a recent date. In the very short span of her history 
it is not unnatural that only one such terrible calamity befell 
lier and consequently gave her only one glorious occasion to 
overcome it. But the nations like China, Babylon, Persia, 
Egypt, ancient Peru, ancient Mexico, Greece and Rome and 
many others, which can boast of a history of thousands of 
years, naturally had many occasions of being overcome 
and oppressed by mightier foreign aggressors*. Prom these 
monstrous calamities some of these nations freed themselves 
again and again with exceptional valour, and humbled and 
routed the enemy. These nations with a long tradition of 
thousands of years are naturally proud of many such glorious 
moments recording their signal victories over their enemies. 
The history of India as compared with that of other nations, 
has a consistent and unbroken record. Most of the nations 
that flourished side by side with her in the past are uow 
4 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
extinct and are remembered only by their names. China 
stands today as an old witness of the greatness of India. 
9. Both China and India are vast countries and have 
maintained their independence and power right from the 
ancient days. No wonder they had to face many more 
mortal dangers of foreign domination than the other short­ 
lived nations. The unerring wheel of fortune affected them 
too. Just as India was attacked by the Sakas, the Huns, the 
Mughals and others, so was China too a victim of the invasions 
of these and other alien nations''. She had to build the world- 
famous China-wall all around her territory as a bulwark 
against the Hunnish inroads. Nevertheless the enemies did 
conquer China, sometimes by circumventing the great wall or 
at times crossing it^. Mostly only in parts, but sometimes at 
least, wholly, China had to writhe and squirm under the yoke 
of foreign domination^. Yet every time she could revive 
her strength and overthrow the foreign aggression and regain 
her independence, and even today she is an independent and 
powerful nation. This in itself is a marvel of history. An 
appraisal of Indian history demands the same criterion to be 
adopted. But specially when our country was smarting 
under the British sway, many English writers had so much 
perverted the Indian history and obliged two or three genera­ 
tions of Indian students in their schools and colleges to learn 
it in such a way, that not only the rest of the world but 
even our own people were misled. Absurd and malicious state­ 
ments implying that India as a nation has always been under 
some foreign rule or the other or that Indian history is an 
unbroken chain of defeat after defeat of the Hindus^", have 
been used like currency and are accepted by our people with­ 
out affront or remonstrance or even a formal protest. To 
refute these statements is essential not only from the point 
of view of honour of the nation but also for the sake of 
historical truth. Efforts being made by other historians in 
this direction have to be supported, as far as possible, by 
propaganda. That in itself is a national duty. That is why 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 5 
I have decided here to describe the historical achievements of those generations and of their representative leaders who vanquished the aggressors from time to time and liberated their country. ALEXANDER'S AGGRESSION 
10. Alexander's attack on India is the first well-known 
foreign invasion during the ancient period of Indian history. 
It took place in 326 B.C.", a period of human history when 
the modern European nations like England, France, Germany 
^nd others were not even born. The Roman Empire had not 
^s yet any foundation laid for it. It was only the Greeks 
who were resounding the European stage^*. Small Greek 
•city-states ruled themselves independently. O f these Sparta 
and Athens were the most progressive. But when these small 
separate city-states were invaded by the ruler of a vast, 
well-organized, unitary and very powerful Persian empire,^' 
they were unable to face him successfully. Those small 
•Greek republics did their best to fight the enemy back, but 
all their efforts proved fruitless before the vast ocean-like 
Persian armies. Naturally, the Greeks earnestly thought of 
effecting a fusion of all their separated small city-states into 
•a, powerful Greek Kingdom and forming a united front. So 
Philip, King of Macedonia, who was fired with the same 
ambition, conquered all those small Greek republics"; but 
he died before he could develop them into a mighty nation^^. 
However, his son who succeeded him to the throne, was much 
more ambitious, more eager to gain power than his father 
whom he surpassed in valour^*. It was Alexander. He ins­ 
pired the whole Greek Community with a sense of solidarity 
and militant nationalism. He organised an invincible army, 
and marched on the Persian Emperor, Darius, himself, who 
had been the arch-enemy of the Greeks^'. This well-organised 
Greek army simply routed the vast but ill-organized Persian 
army. At the battle field of Arbela (331 B.C.) whole of the 
Persian administration virtually collapsed^^. With his victo- 
6 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORV 
rious army Alexander marched straight on to the Persian 
capital and after conquering it he proclaimed himself the 
emperor of that country^*. This unprecedented success 
whetted his lust for conquests. With the Greek and Persian 
empires at his feet, the sky seemed to him well within his- 
limit. He was intoxicated with the wild ambition to conquer 
the whole world and therefore he planned to invjide India, of 
which the Greeks had been hearing so much for generations 
together. He thought he would run over India as easily as he^ 
had crushed the Persian as well as the ancient Babylonian 
empire. In order to execute this daring plan he formed a new 
powerful army with the pick of his Greek soldiers, full of 
youthful enthusiasm and equipped it with glittering -weapons. 
This army consisted of one hundred and twenty thousand 
foot-soldiers and a cavalry fifteen thousand strong*". These- 
brave soldiers, mad with victory after victory, had been so- 
much impressed by the unbroken chain of Alexander's con­ 
quests that they looked upon this great general and emperor 
as a divine being. Alexander himself began to pose as the son 
of the Greek God, Zeus^^. 
GEOGRAPHICAL DIMENSIONS OF INDIA 
11. In those days, some two thousand and five hundred 
years ago, the Indian community and Indian Wngdoms had 
spread far beyond the Indus, right up to the boundary of 
Persia. The mountain range known today as the Hindukush 
was at that time called Paropnisus**, by the Greeks. Modern 
Afghanistan was called Gandhar, known in Indian tradition 
by the name, Ahiganasthan*^, while the river Kabul has been 
called Kubha in our ancient literature**. Throughout the 
whole region up to the Hindukush mountain, ruled peacefully 
various states, some small, others large*^. Right from these 
Indian states, all along the banks of the Indus, straight up 
to the place where it leaps into the sea, was a long and un­ 
broken chain of Indian states which strictly followed the 
Vedic religion. Most of them -were republics*" and were then 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 7 
called 'Ganas' or 'Ganarajyas'. Their constitution was essen­ 
tially democratic. There were only two or three monarchies 
worth the name, one of which the biggest and strongest, was 
ruled by a Pourav King, whom the Greeks called Porus*'. 
DR. JAYASWAL'S HINDU POLITY' 
12. Dr. Jayaswal, one of the prominent members of the 
revolutionary party, 'Abhinava Bharat', during the critical 
years of 1907-1910, and later on a world-famous Orientalist, 
has given, after a critical research, a very detailed account of 
the different 'Bharateeya Ganas' spread along both the banks 
of the Indus right up to its confluence with the sea. 
13. According to Greek mythologies, they seem to have 
believed that their ancestors had migrated as a separate 
branch of the original Aryan Stock from the Gandhar and 
other regions beyond the Indus**. When Alexander's forces 
entered the precincts of India they accidentally came across a 
small community of people who called themselves the original 
Greeks*'. They had been completely merged with the Indians, 
but as soon as they saw this Greek army they avowed that 
they were the ancient brethren of those Greeks'**. Alexander, 
too, was led to believe that India must be the original abode 
of his ancestors. He and his whole army were so much de­ 
lighted at the sight of this, their antique fatherland, that 
they stopped fighting for some days and celebrated a great 
festival. The Greeks performed a sacrifice and offered 
oblations to propitiate their Greek deities'^. 
14. The Greek Gods resembled the Vedic ones very 
closely. Their names had undergone changes in pronuncia­ 
tion by corruption in course of time. The Greeks too perfor­ 
med sacrifices as the Indo-Aryans did, and offered oblations 
through the fire to their various deities'*. They were also 
called lonians. 
IONIAN' AND YAVAN' 
15. It is likely that these Greeks were the descendants 
8 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
of Anu, the son of Yayati ? One wonders if Anwayan was 
later on corrupted to Indian. This bit of a guess must, how­ 
ever, be left to the research scholars. The fact remains that 
the Indians called these Greeks 'Yavanas' from the very 
beginning, as is seen from the Sanskrit literature'*. It is from 
the Greek word 'lonians' that they came to be called 'Yavans' 
or 'Yons' in India. 
B U D D H A N O T H E A R D O F F R O M G A N D H A R - 
PANCHANAD TO SINDH 
16. One more fact deserves mention here. The contem­ 
porary Greek writers have given in their books detailed 
descriptions of the varied life of the people from those parts 
of India where Alexander moved—from Gandhar to Panchanad 
(the Punjab) and thence along both the banks of the Indus to 
the very place where it flows into the sea. But throughout 
all these descriptions not a single reference to either Lord 
Buddha or the Buddhistic cult or sect can be found, whereas 
there are numerous references to the Vedic Hindus'*. From 
this and, of course, from other contemporary references it is 
quite clear that at least till that time the Buddhist; sect was 
quite unknown beyond the Shatadru (Sutlej) river. It means 
that for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred years 
after the death of the Buddha the Buddhist cult spread here 
and there round about Magadha and not farther off, a fact 
which deserves special notice for the proper interpretation of 
subsequent history'*". 
A GREEK MEANS A YAVAN ! 
17. Our contemporary Indian ancestors called these aggressive Greek foreigners, who professed a slightly alien religion, 'Yavans'. But that is not the reason why we should call all foreign aggressors 'Yavans'. It is obviously a mis­ take. Especially when our people began to call.the Muslims 'Yavans', they really committed a blunder. Although the Greeks were aggressors and foreigners, they were, compara- 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 9 
tively speaking, considered to be particularly devoted to 
learning and highly cultured and civilized according to the 
standards of the time. The Muslim hordes that invaded India, 
centuries afterwards, were highly fanatical, diabolic and ruth­ 
lessly destructive. It would have been in the fitness of things 
to call them 'Mussalmans' in view of their demonic nature. 
To call them 'Yavans, is doubly wrong in as much as it un­ 
duly flatters them and does a very great injustice to the word 
'Yavan' itself. The Mussalmans may be called 'Mlenchhas', 
mot 'Yavans'. 
ALEXANDER AND STUPID MUSLIMS 
18. A stupid notion common amongst most of the Mus­ 
lims is worth a mention here. The name 'Alexander' was 
•corrupted into 'Shikandar' in the Persian language. So long 
as the Greek empire had Persia under its sway many of the 
Persian people highly impressed by the unprecedented valour 
•of Alexander named their new-born sons Shikandar. Later 
on even after the Persians were converted to Islam this 
practice of naming their children 'Shikandar' persisted. 
The Muslim converts in India adopted that practice. But 
ignorant of the historical origin of the word 'Shikandar' 
thousands of Muslims in India fondly believe that, like 
Mohammad Ali, Kasim and others, the name Shikandar is a 
^Muslim name; and (that valiant Alexander must be some Mus­ 
lim personality). Nay, he could be so very valiant and a world 
•conqueror simply because he was a Muslim. If any one tries 
to convince these fanatics, vulgar and vain-glorious Muslims 
that 'Shikandar (Alexander) was not a Muslim, that he could 
never be one, as Mohammed Paighamber, the founder of the 
Muslim religion, was himself born not less than a thousand 
years after the death of Shikandar, these, die-hard Muslims, 
would call that person un-informed. 
19. The eastern boundary of Alexander's empire at 
that time was the Hindukush mountains. After having 
•crossed these mountains he marched with his vast armies 
10 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Straight to Taxila in India The King of Taxila, King Ambuj 
(Ambhi) accepted his overlordship without giving him any 
battle'®. Some Greek writers assert that this very King of 
Taxila had invited Alexander in order to put down his rival, 
King Porus'*". If that is so, Ambhi had quite naturally to 
pay for his treachery by his willing, though abject submission 
to the Greeks. 
UNIVERSITY IN TAXILA AND A 
STRANGE COINCIDENCE 
20. Taxila was the seat of the most famous Indian 
University of the time, where students from different count­ 
ries came to study various sciences and arts. Even the Princes, 
of different states came there, learnt political science and got 
lessons in the art of governance, warfare and strictly observed 
the rules of discipline prevalent there''. 
21. By some strange coincidence, just when Alexander 
was marching at the head of his army into India, after reduc­ 
ing Taxila, a brilliant youth, who, a little later, was destined 
to carve a glorious page in the history of India was learning 
the sciences of war and politics in the same University of 
Taxila'8. He was called Chandragupta. The old teacher who 
was well-versed in different lores of the time and was also an 
astute politician and was giving lessons in politics and na­ 
tional revolutionary activities to this splendid youth under 
the portals of the same University, was Chanakya'*. 
22. But in the confusion wrought by this invasion of 
Alexander these two exceptionally gifted personalities had 
not yet attracted public attention to themselves. Both of 
them had been watching very closely the movements of Alex­ 
ander's vast forces. Alexander had, as it were, put all the 
crowns and coronets of Kings, and kings of kings and of all 
the small Rav's and Raval's, into a melting pot and forged 
a single crown to proclaim himself the Emperor of India ; 
while the old sage, Acharya Chanakya, was secretly planning 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 11 
an easy transfer of that covetable crown to his young 
disciple's head by means of a coup d'etat. 
WAR WITH PORUS 
23. The king of Taxila, Ambuj or Ambhi had, as already 
said, bowed down to the Greek might without fighting a 
single battle, and therefore everybody began to jeer at his 
treacherous act, as it humiliated the braver spirits. In 
order to counteract it, the neighbouring Indian monarchies 
and republics decided to force a bitter struggle on the Greeks. 
It is really unfortunate that these various independent 
Indian states did not think of making it a common cause, or 
perhaps had no time to do it. As soon as he reached Taxila,. 
Alexander without any loss of time, sent ultimatum, to all 
the neighbouring Indian states, demanding unconditional 
surrender, and when Taxila's very next neighbour. King 
Porus, ignored his ultimatum and took up the challenge, the 
Greek captain-general macrhed on him*". 
24. King Porus mainly depended on his war-chariots 
and elephants, whereas the Greeks relied upon their cavalry 
brigades. The river Vitasta (Jhelum) separated the two 
armies. All of a sudden, even before the two armies joined 
battle, torrential rains overflowing the river with high floods 
began to assail them all round. Alexander searched high 
and low and in a few days found to the north a place where 
the river was fordable. With precipitate haste, he crossed 
the river and with his fine cavalry, dashed against the forces 
of King Porus". This disturbed the whole plan of Porus; 
still he fought on a fierce battle. But the rains had turned 
the field muddy ^^o, rendering utterly useless Porus's two 
great instruments of war, namely chariots and elephants. 
He could not, therefore, successfully check the brisk and 
energetic attacks of Alexander's horsemen. In the thick of 
the battle, Porus seated on his elephant and desperatly 
fighting, was grievously wounded*^'' and fell into the hands 
of the enemy. Thus, partly because of Porus's misfortune and 
12 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
partly because of Alexander's military skill on the battle­ 
field, the Greeks were crowned with success. 
VICTORY—SHREWD POLITICAL STRATEGY 
25. When Porus was taken as a captive before Alexan­ 
der, the latter asked the Indian King, "How should I treat 
you ?" Porus promptly replied, 'like a King'. This apt reply 
has evoked the comment of European as well as our own 
historians that impressed by this bold reply, Alexander 
returned to Porus his territory making him a governor under 
him, instead of putting him to death"". But this inter­ 
pretation of Alexander's treatment of Porus is wrong, and 
therefore, such platitudes should be avoided in school text­ 
books. 26. Obviously, Alexander was not like the artless simple 
Indian King, Harishchandra, who gave away his kingdom in 
his wakeful hours in order to fulfil a promise made in dream. 
He knew if he killed Porus or liquidated his kingdom, placing 
in his place some Greek Satrap, the highminded people 
of the state would be aflame with rage and hatred towards 
the Greeks. Now Alexander wanted to fight his way all 
along to the chief Capital of India, namely Pataliputra ! Could 
he ever do so with the sole support of his own Greek army ? 
On the other hand, it was far more profitable to win over 
Porus with apparent magnanimity and kindness as he had 
done to king Ambhi of Taxila (Takshashila) and enlist his 
active support in order to facilitate the accomplishment of his 
daring plan of the conquest of India. It is, therefore, not for 
the sake of appreciating the bold rejoinder of Porus but as 
a clever political strategy, that arch diplomat Alexander 
returned to Porus his Kingdom. He even annexed the smaller 
neighbouring states, which he had conquered immediately 
before or after his clash with Porus to the latter's kingdom. 
He had appointed him as his Satrap (governor) of this vast 
Indian province**. Porus too gave his assent uo Alexander's 
proposals to simply wait for his time for fortune h.ad played 1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH IS 
foul with him. Porus had done his duty, as a Kshatriya war­ 
rior would do, of fighting till the end against the enemy of

vluable tenet in political science. Knowing that the submis­ 
sion of king Porus was only time serving, the Indian popu­ 
lace also did not take it amiss. It will be shown later how at 
the opportune time King Porus (now Satrap Porus) turned 
the tables against Alexander himself. 
27. After the end of the war with Porus, Alexander set 
himself up to the task of stabilising the newly conquered 
neighbouring states and began a careful study of the life of 
the people there and in the yonder regions. Besides, to 
replenish his army that was depleted in numbers and energy 
because of the incessant wars from the Hindukush to the 
Panchanad, Alexander ordered fresh regiments of forces from 
his Satraps in Babylon and Greece, and sent back those of 
his fighting forces who were wounded and rendered invalid 
and also those who were shirkers*'. 
INQUIRY OF THE INDIAN ASCETICS 
28. The scouts whom Alexander had sent round to- 
survey the local condition of the people i n the subjugated 
as well as non-subjugated provinces, brought, among other 
reports, detailed descriptions of the penance-groves in the 
forests, and of the ascetics, anchorites, recluses, freed from 
oil worldly bonds, wandering about all alone in search of 
knowledge and also of those sages who were deeply engrossed 
in philosophical thought. Alexander himself was fond of 
learning and philosophical discussions, for he called himself 
the disciple of the great philosopher, Aristotle. He had 
already heard much in Greece itself of such ascetics and of 
austere Brahmins. So he earnestly desired to see person­ 
ally at least some of these austere Brahmins in India, who the 
Greeks called 'Gymnosophists' and have talks with them. So - 
he sent for some of such hermits from their forest-abodes** 
and some he saw in their secluded cells. The Greek writers. 
14 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
themselves have given some interesting tales about such 
occasions. I would like to cite a tale or two from among 
those in the words of the Greek writers themselves, so as to 
throw some light on the thoughts and feelings of the Greeks 
and their leader, Alexander. 
29. "This philosopher (Kalanos), we are told, showed 
Alexander a symbol of his empire. He threw down on the 
ground a dry and shrivelled hide and planted his foot on the 
edge of it. But when it was trodden down in one place, it 
started up everywhere else. He then walked all round it 
and showed that the same thing took place wherever he trod, 
until at length he stepped into the middle and by doing so 
made it all lie flat. This symbol was intended to show 
Alexander that he should control his empire from its centre 
and not wander away to its distant extremities"*^. 
THE CANON OF DANDAMIS 
30. Alexander keenly felt that he should send for and 
have a personal talk with one Brahmin, of whom he had 
heard so much in Taxila (Takshasheela). The Greeks called 
this Brahmin 'Dandamis'*" but I have not so far succeeded 
in tracing down his original Sanskrit name. The Brahmin, bent 
with age and knowledge, was free from all worldly ties and 
wandered naked everywhere. He did not pay any heed to 
Alexander's messages. Thereupon Alexander sent his own offi­ 
cer 'Onesikretos' to this selfless recluse who told him, "Alex­ 
ander, the very son of God Zeus (Sansk: Dyus) and a world- 
conqueror has summoned you to his court. If you still fail 
to come, you will be beheaded instantaneously." The Brahmin 
began to laugh vociferously at this threat and replied, "If 
Alexander is the son of Zeus; in the same manner and for 
the same reason I am also the son of that very Zeus (Dyus). 
As to his boast of being a world-conqueror, it is absolutely 
vain! He has not as yet seen the other bank of the river Vyas. 
If he successfully faces the brave Indian states beyond and, 
yonder still, the powerful empire of Magadha, and still 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 15 
remcains alive, we shall have time to consider whethere he is 
a world-conqueror. Alexander offers me land and gold, but go 
and tell him that ascetics like me spit upon such things. This 
mother-land of mine provides me with everything I want, 
with the loving care of a real mother. If Alexander is going 
to chop my head off, then my head and body would mix up 
with this earth of which they are made, but he would never be 
able to murder my soul. It is invincible, indestructible and 
immortal. Go and tell him that he should issue these threats 
to those who are slaves of gold and power and are afraid of 
death. Before us these threats of a mortal like Alexander 
fall flat and are powerless! For, a true ascetic Brahmin can 
never be won over by gold, nor does he ever fear death !! I 
won't come! Go away." 
31. We have quoted only some of the sentences from 
the reply of Dandamis to Alexander. Greek writers have 
given the full text of his fearless and direct reply**". Plutarch 
too, has mentioned these tales. Some writers*' astounded by 
his dauntless and straight-forward answer, have remarked, 
"If at all anyone in the world has so successfully defied 
Alexander, who had conquered so many kingdoms, it was 
this naked, old Brahmin ascetic of India"*'". 
BRAHMINS HANGED FOR POLITICAL CONSPIRACY 
32. In his survey Alexander came to know that although 
these world-forsakers, ascetics, recluses and others were 
wandering all alone, their opinions exerted a powerful influ­ 
ence because of their disinterestedness, fearlessness and their 
disregard for any consequences whatever, upon the govern­ 
ments of Indian republics and also on the monarchies. The 
tongues of these free and fearless Brahmin ascetics had 
sharp edges like the swords of the Indian Kshatriyas and 
they protested against the unjust Greek aggression very 
sharply and spread, openly or secretly, great discontent 
against Alexander amongst the Indian populace. Naturally 
his first adoration of these 'Gymnosophists' suddenly gave 
16 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
place to his intense hatred against the Brahmin hermits. 
Thereupon he began to seize some such Brahmins and hang 
them*8. Before beheading one such Brahmin, when Alexan­ 
der asked him as to why he instigated a certain Indian ruler 
against the Greeks, he fearlessly and firmly replied that it 
was his most sacred tenet and that if he were to live, he 
ought to live honourably, else he should die honourably." 
(Plutarch LXIV). 
33. After defeating King Porus, Alexander thought his 
dazzling victory should unnerve the neighbouring states and 
force them to submit meekly, but his hopes in this respect 
mostly belied him. As he crossed the Vitasta (Jhelum) and 
marched onward, the various republics, big or small, on his 
way began to offer sanguinary battles**. Without a decision 
at the battlefield, they would never accept his overlordship 
meekly. Although the superior number and might of the Greeks 
went on overpowering the Indians, the consequent strain of 
incessant fighting did not fail to make itself felt on the Greeks. 
34. Greek writers have described many such battles 
with various Indian republics, but this is no occasion to 
mention them either at some length or briefly. However, 
some of the chosen incidents have got to be given here 
at some length, at least as a mark of respect to those brave 
Indian republics who, though not jointly yet severally, offered 
the toughest of resistance to that mighty Greek army of a 
hundred thousand gallant soldiers and their brave, world- 
famous, captain-general Alexander, who had vowed pom­ 
pously to trample over the whole of India and conquer the 
Crown of Magadha. for himself, and which finally forced him to 
strike a retreat homeward from the very threshold of India. 
REPUBLICS OF SAUBHOOTIS AND KATHAS 
35. The constitution of both these republics was demo­ 
cratic. Writes a Greek writer Diodoros,^" 'they were gover­ 
ned by laws in the highest degree salutary and their political 
system was admirable'^"". One special feature of these 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 17 
republics was that with a view to promoting healthy, strong 
and handsome progeny, the procreation of human species 
was not left to individual whims and fancies, but was 
controlled by the state. They were very fond of physical 
beauty*'"'. Hence marriages were arranged not with an eye 
on the handsome dowry, but with proper consideration of 
mutual physical fitness, beauty and health, and the ability 
of the bride and the bridegroom to bring forth healthy and 
sturdy children. Even while electing their leaders, who were 
to guide the nation and bear the yoke of national welfare, 
sufi"icient weightage was given to the candidate's build of the 
body and physical strength. Their laws regarding the proper 
production of human species were so strict that within three 
months of their birth children were medically examined by 
the state authorities, and if a child were found with some 
native defect or to he suffering from some incurable disease 
or deformed, it was immediately put to death under state 
orders without any mercy*"". 
35-A. Readers of history know well that tht Republic 
of Sparta had similar laws about heredity*^. 
36. Though not so very strict and ruthless as the 
Saubhootis and the Kathas, there were other Ganas or 
republics in India who paid special attention to heredity, 
and the bringing forth of strong and handsome children. 
The 'Vrishnis' were also very particular, from the ancient 
times, about the physical beauty and strength of their lead­ 
ers and state officials. The physical strength and beauty 
of the world-famous leader of these Vrishnis, Lord Shree 
Krishna, has been immortalized. Lord Shree Krishna's sons, 
too, have been credited by the Puranas** with exceptional 
beauty. 
REPUBLIC SUBSISTING BY ARMS 
37. A good many republics, in the Panchanad (the Punjab) 
and along both the banks of the Indus, right up to its great 
leap into the sea, were said to be living on weapons*'. The 
18 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
most remarkable fact about them was that not only the men 
but the women too in those republics, had necessarily to 
undergo military training so that at the time of war, literally 
the whole nation could be drafted for military action. 
Although different from each other in some particular 
respects, their constitutions, needless to say, were essen­ 
tially democratic. Whether big or small in size, they were 
all independent. 
THE REPUBLIC OF THE YOUDHEYAS 
38. The Republic of the Youdheyas, spread far and wide in the fertile lands to the south of the river Vyas in the Panchanad (the Punjab), was the most prominent of them all. It was looked upon with awe and respect by every one because of its valiant youths who always fought for their independence regardless of their lives. It was truly called, by the foreign historians**, 'A nation in arms'. They too had a law necessitating everyone between the ages of 18 and 21 to undergo sound military training which kept not only their male but even the female population well-equipped with arms. 39. On seeing Alexander march down the Vitasta (Jhelum) and the Chandrabhaga (Chenab) in order to cross the Vyas, after defeating King Porus, the adjoining republics and the hill tribes, the gallant Youdheyas**, who were to the south of the river, spurned Alexander's ultimatum of abject surrender and began all-out preparations for war. Yet the so-called Emperor of Magadha, the cowardly Dhananand, was not roused from his stupor. That lily-livered coward does not seem to have sent any military help to the gallant Youdheyas in order to vanquish Alexander at the very portals of India. Nevertheless, the Youdheyas got ready to face Alexander, relying on nothing but their own strength. 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 19 
ALEXANDER'S ARMY STRUCK WITH TERROR 
40. When Alexander's army came fighting to the banks 
of the river Vyas, after crossing the Indus, the Vitasta, and 
the Chandrabhaga, they came to know that beyond that 
river the democratic Youdheyas had taken arms to fight for 
their independence against the Greeks. Besides, they learnt 
about their bravery and also of the fact that beyond the 
Youdheyas mightier Indian states along the banks of the 
Ganges were making ready to fight with them. Though the 
Greek soldiers already spent and disgusted with unceasing 
warfare with the Indians in the Panchanad, dared not cross 
the Vyas and join battle with the courageous and daring 
Indian states like the Youdheyas and the others**. 
41. But the lust for war and conquest of their war- 
intoxicated enterprising, and exceptionally courageous cap­ 
tain-general and emperor, Alexander, was not quenched in the 
least. He proclaimed, throughout all the divisions of his 
army, his immutable decision to cross the Vyas, conquer the 
Youdheyas and march straight off to Magadha. This obsti­ 
nate declaration of Alexander roused a great furore and rage 
amongst the already war-weary army, even amongst the 
veterans ! The Greek soldiers secretly began to pass resolu­ 
tions, group by group, to refuse straightaway to go ahead. 
In spite of the fact that they had been considering Alexander 
unconquerable and the son of God Zeus, they were extremely 
disgusted with his lust for power. No sooner did Alexander 
smell of this dissatisfaction amongst his soldiers, he delivered 
an inspiring speech. 
ALEXANDER S SPEECH TO HIS ARMY*' 
41-A "On seeing that you, 0 Macedonians and allies ! 
no longer follow me into dangers with your wonted alacrity. 
I have summoned you to this assembly that I may either 
persuade you to go farther or to be persuaded by you to 
turn back if we have driven the Scythians back into their 
deserts, and if besides the Indus, Hydaspes, Akesines and 
20 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Hydraotes flow through the territories that are ours, why 
should you hesitate to pass the Hyphasis also ? Are you 
afraid ? 
41-B "For my part, I think that to a man of spirit there is no other aim and end of his labours except the labours themselves 
41-C "But if any one wishes to know the limits of the present warfare, let him understand that the river Ganges and the Eastern sea are now at no great distance off. 
41-D "But if we turn back, many warlike nations extending beyond the Hyphasis to Eastern sea and many others lying northwards between these and Hyrkania, to say nothing of their neighbours, the Scythian tribes, will be left behind us unconquered, so that if we turnback, there is cause to fear lest the conquered nations, as yet wavering in their fidelity, may be instigated to revolt by those who are still independent. 0 Macedonians and allies ! glory crowns the deeds of those who expose themselves to toils and dangers 
41-E "Such of you as wish to return home I shall send back to your own country, or even myself will lead you back." 41-F According to Smith, "he (Alexander) recited the glories of their wondrous conquests from Hellespont to Hyphasis, and promised them the dominion and riches of all Asia. But glowing words fell on unwilling ears and were received with painful silence, which remained unbroken for a long time"(P. 79). 
42. But the effect of bis inspiring speech was contrary to his expectations. As it was now amply clear from the very lips of Alexander that they would be required to fight more sanguinary wars of attrition, they were scared to the marrow. Dr. Jayswal writes in his Hindu Polity, "The Greek army refused to move an inch forward against the nations whose very name, according to Alexander, struck his soldiers with terror"*'. 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 21 
43. Alexander was extremely enraged to see that his 
soldiers disobeyed him by flatly refusing to cross the Vyas 
in order to save all further trouble, because they were tho­ 
roughly exhausted and afraid to fight immediately without 
any rest**. But Alexander was as cunning as he was brave. 
Apprehending danger, Alexander refrained from doing any 
thing rash in a fit of anger and straightaway walked off into 
his tent in utter despair. He stopped talking to anybody. 
He did not show himself outside his tent for three consecu­ 
tive days*". Then he thoughtfully hatched a new plan in 
his mind. He, thereafter, gathered the whole of the Greek 
army and told them that he had given up the plan of cross­ 
ing the Vyas. He said, "I have now decided to go back to 
Greece". This statement naturally elated the rank and file 
of his army. Alexander then asked, "But how are we to go 
back ? If we turn our backs straightaway and go to Greece 
by the same route as we came along, all this Indian territory 
we have conquered would rise in revolt, thinking that we 
are stricken with terror. So instead of turning our back 
straight off towards the land route to Greece we should 
better go a little obliquely to the sea along the banks of the 
Indus and then return to Persia along the sea-route. Next 
time when we shall come again to India, we shall conquer 
the Indian states beyond the Ganges and accomplish our 
conquest of India"*"". 
44. True it is that Alexander said 'When once again we 
shall come to India'—"But 0 Greek Captain General, once 
again ! Truly ! But when ? Let alone the kingdoms beyond 
the Ganges but if these very states that you have conquered 
today were to renounce the yoke of your sovereignty and 
become indepedent, then ? Nay, even before that next time 
you mentioned, if you yourself were to be no more then...? 
Even the race of Zeus can succumb to the ravages of time, 
may it then belong to Greece !" 
45. If those Indian Gymnosophists, ascetics and recluses 
iave ridiculed Alexander's threat of coming back again 
22 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
to India in some such manner, it could never have been out 
of place. 
ALEXANDER'S RETREAT 
46. However loudly and pompously Alexander might have swaggered with his mouth, the fact remains that the Greek soldiers took a feght of the Youdheyas and others bej'ond the Vyas and hence Alexander could not dare cross that river! Indian valour had taken the conceit out of the haughty spirit of the advancing Greek army, and so they had to strike a retreat. Alexander did not retire willingly. The Greeks proved to be powerless before the Indians, and hence was this ignoble retreat ! To hide this simple fact the Greek and European historians write, ''Had he but crossed the Vyas Alexander would have defeated not only the Youdheyas but the Magadha empire also. The Youdheyas and the Magadhas had never actually defeated the Greek army of Alexander on the open battlefield"." These boastful'ifs'and 'whens' can be answered most aptly on behalf of the valorous Indian Youdheyas in some such way : 
—Kalidas' Shakuntalam, Act 3 Shi oka 1 
[Why fight with an enemy who flees away at the mere twang of our bow] 
47. Again this typical itch of the Greek army for fighting in the open field was to be allayed for ever by the Indian military strength a little later ! Soon Chandragupta was to make his entry on the military stage of India. Wait a bit, 0 you, reader ! 
ALEXANDER BUILDS A POWERFUL NAVY 
48. Soon after his retreat from the Vyas, Alexander 
had five to six hundred warships built in order to make his 
way to the sea along the course of the Indus*'. Embark- 1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 23 
ing thousands of his well-equipped warriors on these war­ 
ships, he began to march off to the sea through the river. 
About the commencement of this voyage of Alexander along 
the waters of the Indus, arrived the two fresh regiments of 
forces ordered from Babylon and Greece*'". Naturally, 
the heretofore war-weary and rebellious Greek soldiers of 
Alexander were cheered up once more. 
49- But while Alexander was making his way towards 
the sea after striking an 'honourable' retreat from the V y a s , 
a very great political conspiracy began to shape itself most 
secretly throughout the Greek-trodden Indian territory 
from the banks of the Vyas right up to Gandhar. But of 
that conspiracy we shall have occasion to speak in a more 
detailed way a little later. Here it should suffice to say that 
the Indian republics along both the banks of the Indus, 
whether big or small-made light of Alexander's threat to 
come again to conquer India as nothing more than a pompous 
political stunt, and prepared grimly to oppose his forces as 
severely and as stubbornly as possible. But alas ! it was. 
a decision taken separately by each particular republic. It 
was not a well-organized, united effort, under a central 
authority to destroy the Greeks under Alexander. Hence the 
same story of Gandhar and Panchanad was repeated here, and 
the well organized army of Alexander, with its superior 
numbers, could successfully fight each Indian republic and 
go ahead. Even if these stray battles with various Indian 
armies did not fail to exhaust and weaken Alexander's forces, 
still they could not crush him completely. There were, of 
course, some exceptions to these separatist war-efforts. Of 
them at least two, which even the hostile Greek historians 
praise whole-heartedly and which gave such a severe blow to 
Alexander, deserve a brief mention here. 
THE REPUBLICS OF THE MALAVAS 
AND THE SHUDRAKAS 
50. The two republics led their separate lives along the 
24 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
banks of the Indus. Both were rich, brave democracies with 
a high sense of honour. Of the two, Malava republic was the 
more famous from the ancient times and was quite extensive. 
These two republics had at times been hostile to each other. 
But when they saw Alexander's powerful navy went on defea­ 
ting every single Indian state in various battles and kept 
on forging its way to the sea, the political leaders of both 
these republics decided to correct the mistake of these 
several Indian democracies which fought singly with a vastly 
superior enemy, a mistake which was proving fatal to their 
wider national interests. So, instead of fighting the Greek 
army singly, they decided to amalgamate their fighting forces 
under a unified control**. Not only did they unite their men 
at arms but they intermarried in order to bring about politi­ 
cal and social unity among them. For the intermingling 
of castes and blood they had a great collective marriage 
ceremony, wherein at least a thousand girls from both the 
'Ganas' (republics) were inter-married to the youths of the 
other republic. 
51. While this unified army of the Malava-Shudrak 
republics was fighting tooth and nail with the Greeks, Alexan­ 
der laid siege to one of their important cities. Although the 
name of this city cannot be ascertained positively, it must 
have been some capital city or one of similar importance. As 
this republican city kept on fighting desperately the Greek 
siege had to be prolonged. The haughty Alexander could not 
bear it. He thought of ordering the ladders to be put up on the 
ramparts of the enemy stronghold and commanding his Greek 
oldiers to climb them up and straightaway storm the city. 
52. But the same sort of unrest and disaffection 
against Alexander began to be seen in his army as was 
once experienced at the time of the crossing of the Vyas. 
The Greek army was avowedly wending its way homeward in 
order to avoid new wars. But all along the bank of the Indus 
they had to fight fresh battles. And they knew that unless 
Alexander gave up his aggressive designs calculated to pacify 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 25 
iis unsatiable lust for conquests brutal wars were unavoid­ 
able. Because of this bitter war with the Malava-Shudrak 
•conabined forces, the Greek discontent reached the climax and 
there were rebellious whispers openly flouting Alexander's 
•commands. 
52-A 'When the Macedonian soldiers found that they 
i a d still on hand a fresh war which the most war-like 
nations (lujjjS) would be their antagonists, they were struck 
with unexpected terror and began again to upbraid the King 
in the language of sedition. (Curtius Bk. IX Ch. IV as quoted 
in 'Hindu Polity') {Mc Crindle I. L. by, Alexander P. 234). 
53. Still in the end Alexander promulgated his command 
to his soldiers to climb up the ladders and leap straight into 
the enemy stronghold which valiantly defied the Greek siege. 
Seeing that his Greek soldiers hesitated to undertake the 
'daring feat, that exceptionally valiant commander of the 
'Greeks, the mighty Alexander, himself began to climb one of 
the ladders put up against the ramparts of the stronghold. At 
this the whole Macedonian army was suddenly inspired to do 
the great deed, and all began to climb instantaneously. Once 
at the top of the ramparts Alexander straightaway jumped 
down in the midst of the enemy and there ensued a hand-to- 
hand fight between the Indian and the Greek forces. 
And suddenly— 
54. And suddenly an Indian warrior took out an en­ 
venomed arrow from his sheath and applied it to his bow­ 
string and let it fly with an unmistakable aim at the place 
where Alexander stood edging on his warriors, and shining in 
his golden helmet**. 
65. It was not an arrow, ii; was in fact Indian revenge 
incarnate. To use the lines of poet Moropant (with a slight 
variation, of course) we can say— 
(with apologies to Moropant !rRfm'^cr-^?Tf<T#) 
26 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
ALEXANDER ROLLED INTO A POOL OF BLOOD 
56. The shaft of the Indian warrior unmistakably pierced the heart of Alexander, and suddenly the emperor rolled down unconscious**. A Greek soldier immediately covered him with his shield. There was a sudden hue and cry in the Greek ranks that Alexander had been wounded, that he had fallen unconscious. With exceptional daring the Greeks lifted him from the pool of blood and carried him safely to his camp. There with great difficulty that terrible shaft of the Indian warrior was extricated. The Greeks heaved a sigh ot relief when after a long time of patient nursing, Alexander gradually regained consciousness. It took several days for the wound to heal up. During all this time Alexander was confined to bed. 
57. But everywhere, in Babylon and Greece, the news that was received reported that Alexander was killed in the war by an Indian arrow*'. Consequently there were some uprisings in Gandhar and Persia. But later on when it was known that Alexander was only severely wounded and was now recovering, the situation came to normalcy. 
58. No wonder whatsoever, if the news of Alexander's having fainted by a bow-shot was greeted cheerfully through­ out the Malava-Shudrak republic. Alexander was so much puffed up with pride when King Pourav (Poros) was wounded in the battle, thao he circulated a new coin with a picture showing his fall stamped on it. The coin is still to be seen as a mark of his vanity*'". That insult inflicted on India was fully avenged by the Indian arrow which sent the Greek emperor rolling down on the battlefield in pools of blood. The Ionian Emperor, Alexander, who unjustifiably shed Indian blood, was made to atone for it personally by the- shedding of his blood. 
59. The Malava-Shudrak republic too should have stam­ ped on some golden coin the picture of Alexander fallen in a pool of blood with an arrow deeply thrust into his chest.. Possibly they did. 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 27 
60. According to his cruel military code, he had been 
cruelly crushing down the states which had opposed him. 
But whenever there appeared any foe who was equally strong 
and who retaliated furiously, Alexander had the cunning to 
dissemble nobility and frankness of heart. When he recovered 
from his wound, he began to make overtures of peace to the 
commanders of the Malava-Shudrak army instead of dictating 
his usual arrogant terms*'. For cease-fire talks a hundred 
representatives of the joint Malava-Shudrak republic were 
elected, and for them Alexander held a grand reception 
ceremony in his camp. Detailed and very entertaining 
descriptions of this reception are available in the books 
of Greek historians**. But for want of space we have to 
satisfy ourselves with a brief reference to it. The hundred 
representatives were, even according to the Greek standards, 
of uncommon height, heavily built, having handsome muscular 
bodies. They were clad in valuable embroidered clothes and 
had worn beautiful ornaments of gold and pearls and precious 
stones. Everyone of them went to the Greek camp in his 
well-decorated and well-equipped golden chariot. They had 
with them elephants, too, with costly and beautiful outfits. 
The Greeks had always felt a special fascination for the 
elephants. 
61. Although ranking in his mind was the fact that 
these very representatives of the Malava-Shudrak joint 
republic had brought upon him, a little while ago, a mortal 
danger, Alexander showed his magnanimity in that reception 
ceremony and paraded his own imperial splendour. For every 
one of those hundred representatives there was a special 
golden seat. The banquet which was given in their honour 
was attended with costly wines and excellent savoury 
dishes**". The grand banquet was followed by various field 
games and tournaments, music and dancing. In the end, a 
treaty was signed by the Malava-Shudrak representatives and 
Alexander'*. 
62. The divergent accounts given about this treaty by 
^8 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
various Greek writers of the time have at least this much in common to tell. The Greeks and the Indians had jointly agreed to put a stop to their hostilities and that the Malava- Shudrak republic was not to cause any harassment to the retreating army of Alexander while it was progressing on its way home along the Indus. Of these two valiant republics, the Malavas will be referred to later on when, I shall be des­ cribing the wars with the Sakas, the Yuechis and other Mlenchha powers. The fact that this Malava republic had been prosperous and strong for many centuries to come, therefore, need not be specially proved. 
63. Even the Greek writers could not help recording some more acts of valour during the Indian resistance to the Greek onslaught, although the details of the time and place of their happenings are not available. Two of them are cited -here to serve as specimens. 
THE TREACHEROUS ATTACK OF THE 
GREEKS ON MASAGA TRIBE 
64. At Masaga, Alexander captured a small armed 
community of seven thousand, which included several women. 
Alexander promised them their lives on condition that they 
should join his army and fight with his Indian enemies, or 
else, he threatened them with wholesalem an-slaughter. Or, 
as a third alternative, he said, he would carry them off as 
slaves ! The leaders of the community agreed to his first 
proposal, but requested that they should be allowed one night 
for mutual exchange of views. Alexander agreed. There­ 
upon these seven thousand Indians marched towards a hill 
some nine miles ahead of the Greek Camp. Writes Vincent 
Smith, 'The Indians being unwilling to aid the foreigners 
in the subjugation of their countrymen desired to evade the 
unwelcome obligation'TM". So they decided to give the 
slip to the Greeks. But Alexander came to know of their 
intention. So while they were sleeping for a little rest, 
Alexander fell upon them all of a sudden with his huge army

and began to cut down everyone. There was a great havoc amongst those Indians. But within a short time they drew up their swords and other weapons. They made a hollow circular formation, gathering the women and children inside it, and faced the Greek attack most heroically. A good many women also were found desperately fighting with the foe. Till almost all of them were killed they kept on fighting for the freedom of their nation.

THE AGRASHRENIS 
65. This little Indian republic of the Agrashrenis too, instead of surrendering, fought to the last with the vast Greek navy of Alexander as it was making its headway to the sea through the course of the Indus. When the Greeks attacked their very capital these brave Indian warriors erected blockades and barricades at different intervals and fought every inch of their ground so tenaciously that Alexander could not enter the city before he had sacrificed many Greek lives. According to Curtius," "when those brave fellows could not further resist the odds, they (the Agrashrenis) set their houses on fire and their wives and children and all threw themselves into the flames'^" !" That is to say, they 'made johar' (to use a later day phraseology). 
THIS IS T H E S A M E J O H A R I—JAI H A R !! 
66. We. generally believe that this magnificent and awe-inspiring tradition of 'johar' or self-immolation of large groups of men and women in times of national crisis was ori­ ginally practised by the Rajputs only. But instances, like the one just mentioned, cited by the Greek writers who were astounded to witness them, go to prove that, even before the name of the Rajputs was ever heard of, this splendid 
30 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
tradition was followed by our Indian warriors right from the 
ancient days. The word 'johar' is comparatively modern. 
It was perhaps derived from the war-cry 'Jai Har' ! The 
Indian God of war and destruction is Har 1 Har ! Mahadev !! 
That is why the Indians fought desperately inspired by this 
deafening war-cry ! The Marathas too used the same war-cry 
'Har, Har, Mahadev !' After fighting to the last, when every 
hope of success was over, or every chance of escape from the 
enemy was lost, this johar, this martyrdom, this noblest type 
of self-sacrifice was resorted to by the Hindus as the last 
unfailing weapon to save their religion, their nation, their 
own self-respect and to avoid captivity, abject slavery and 
hateful conversion ! As soon as all men of fighting age were 
slain on the battlefield after taking the greatest toll of the 
enemy blood, their wives, mothers, daughters, hundreds of 
them, with babies at their breasts, used to leap into the burn­ 
ing pyres, specially kept ready for the purpose, and were 
reduced to ashes. This was what was known as'Johar'! It 
was not an easy job ! It was the limit of valour and endu­ 
rance for the sake of keeping up the prestige of one's self and 
one's own religion ! 
67. Whoever had donned this exceptional armour of 
'johar' and its leaping flames were beyond all attempts of an 
Alexander, an AUa-ud-Din or a Salim—why, even of Satan 
himself—to pollute them and convert them to his religion ! 
Confronted with this horrible sacrificial fire the enemy stood 
aghast, discomfited and crest-fallen. 
68. The above-mentioned' johar'—collective immolation 
of lives—by the Agrashrenis is one of the many described by 
the astounded Greek writers, and which the Indians preferred 
to the humiliation of being the captives of the Greeks. 
THE JANAPAD REPUBLIC OF BRAHMANAKAS ! 
69. At last when Alexander's naval force reached the 
mouth of the Indus, fighting incessantly all the way, it met 
with yet other independent republics. These 'janapadas' or 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 31 
'Ganas' were like the small Greek city-states, and had none 
amongst them which could ably withstand with equal 
numbers the mighty and numerous army of Alexander. Still 
one of them, the 'Brahmanak janapad' made up its mind 
to cross swords with, rather than submit to, Alexander. This 
was the same 'Brahmanak janapad' which is referred to by 
Panini, says Dr. Jayaswal'^*. It is already told how, while 
fighting in the Panchanad (the Punjab), Alexander had wreak­ 
ed his rancourous revenge against the clan of philosophers, 
especially the Brahmans. When Alexander learnt that it was 
the same clan of Brahmans, to which this small state 
belonged, he decided to whack his malicious stroke upon it 
with all his might. Plutarch (McCrindle 'Invasion of India 
by Alexander' P. 306; V. A. Smith E. H . I., P. 106) writes in 
his 'Life of Alexander', "These philosophers were specially 
marked down for revenge by Alexander as they gave him no 
less trouble than the mercenaries. They reviled the princes 
who declared for Alexander and encouraged free states (in 
India) to revolt against his authority. On this account he 
hanged many of them" (Ch LIX). 
69-A. That little 'Janapad' too fought to the last with 
these Greeks for the sake of its national honour and inde­ 
pendence. 
PATTANPRASTHA 
70. What now is called by the Muslims, Sindh Hyderabad, 
was at that time known as Pattanprastha. In Sanskrit lan­ 
guage the cities along the sea-shore, or at the mouths of 
rivers were mostly called 'Pattan'. Pattan is equivalent to 
the English word 'Port'. Perhaps the English word 'Port' 
might have been a corruption of the Sanskrit 'Pattan'. When 
Alexander neared the sea this small state of Pattanprastha 
was confronted with a dilemma : to surrender to the enemy 
was most hateful to the 'Pattanprasthis', but they knew full 
well that they would never be able to fight with the powerful 
Greek army on equal ground. So they resolved the dilemma 
32 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
by forsaking, collectively, their native country, their homes 
and landed property and motherland with sad hearts'*. 
ALEXANDER'S HOMEWARD VOYAGE 
71. That part of the ocean where the Indus flows into 
it should really be called Sindhusagar. Sindhusagar, a name 
for the sea to the west of India, is a fitting counterpart for 
the Gangasagar, a traditional name for the eastern sea. 
72. On first reaching the sea, Alexander divided his 
army into two parts. The first batch he sent back to Iran 
(Persia) by a land route through what now goes by the name 
of Baluchistan". The whole of Alexander's army had been 
thoroughly exhausted in this expedition to India. Moreover, 
Baluchistan, at that time was full of impregnable forests and 
thoroughly unknown to the Greeks. So, the Greek division, 
sent this way, somehow reached Persia, after so many haz­ 
ards and privations. On the other hand, Alexander himself 
set sail by the sea-route with another division of his army 
and reached Persia'*. As the whole of the old Persian 
Empire had now formed a part of Alexander's greater demsne 
he went to his capital namely Babylon. But he did not return 
to the capital in that same triumphant spirit in which he had 
started on his Indian campaign two years ago, with a view to 
winning for himself the vauntful title of the Emperor of India. 
Not only did he not return like the Emperor of India, he did 
not even appear to be an emperor at all. He returned just 
like an ordinary commander of an army despaired and worn 
out after a long-drawn and hazardous campaign. 
INDIA WAS NOT PERSIA 
73. The cause of this disappointment of Alexander was 
that the Greeks up to that time knew only one empire, worth 
the name,—much more extensive than their own—that of 
Persia ! When these Greeks marched upon that Persian 
emipre under their uncommonly brave and brilliant comman­ 
der, Alexander, and when after only two or three campaigns 1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 35 
the vast Persian empire fell before them like a paper palace, 
they were so much flushed with their victory that they fondly 
considered their commander to be endowed with divine 
qualities, and as such unconquerable. Alexander himself 
could not escajje the infection of pride. His ambition to win 
for himself the over lordship of the whole world soared to the 
sky. Bharat appeared to him just next to and as easy a prey 
as, Persia. So very vast a land and so very weak !!! So he 
wanted to crown his Persian conquest with the glittering 
diadem of the Indian imperial authority. Greedily enough he 
ran to have it with all haste ! 
74. But the experience he had had was quite contrary to 
what he had expected. In India he had to face the bitterest 
opposition at every step. Although he never lost a battle as 
such, his Greek army was completely exhausted and exas­ 
perated in the very process of winning them. These victories 
were far too costlier than the ones in Persia, and all their 
vauntful declarations of conquering India as easily as Persia 
proved to be empty words 'full of sound and fury signifying 
nothing'. And in the end he had to return with the acquisi­ 
tion of only a small strip of land along the Indus river. 
75. Thus was Alexander disappointed and to a certain 
extent insulted. But that valiant emperor was not downcast! 
He was itching to return once again to India after stabilizing 
things in the newly conquered regions of India and annexing 
them permanently to his vast empire, like those of Syria, 
Persia, Babylon and others. 
76. Alexander declared the annexation of the region 
from Hindukush and Gandhar to Taxila (Takshasheela), half 
of the Panchanad up to the river Vyas, and that from the 
confluence of the Vitasta with the Indus to the sea. He 
appointed the Indian King Ambuj or Ambhi of Taxila his 
governor (Satrap) of the Hindukush region'*, and King 
Porus as his governor of the Panchanad. To the third but 
narrow strip of land along the Indus, were appointed his two 
trusted Greek generals, Philip and Nicanor, under whom he 
34 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
placed the mobile force of the Greeks. He established in 
India some townships too, one of which was Alexandria in 
the direction of Taxila'*. 
ALEXANDER'S DEATH 
77. Before Alexander decided to stabilize things in the 
Indian territory he had recently captured, he learnt that the 
local democratic institutions refused to accept his over­ 
lordship". Even while Alexander was in Sindh, he received 
intelligence of a revolt by the Indian subjects in Gandhar. He 
was about to send a fresh and large Greek army to Gandhar. 
But in quick succession followed another disturbing news of a 
fresh conspiracy being hatched in the Punjab (Panchanad) to 
overthrow Alexander completely. But Alexander could at 
that time do nothing to thwart any such attempts at revolt. 
During his campaign against India not only his army but he 
himself was completely exhausted. To add to it, his addiction 
to drinking had grown beyond all limits of safety; he suddenly 
took ill and died in B.C. 323. That is to say, hardly within 
a-year-and-a-half of his return from India with all his army 
the great Greek (Macedonian) Emperor breathed his last at 
Babylon'8. 
INDIAN POLITICIANS CONSPIRE 
78. As has already been told, as soon as Alexander 
began to retreat along the Indus, some of the Indian politi­ 
cians began hatching out a secret plan against the Greeks in 
the Punjab to win back their lost freedom. But it was not 
merely aimed at the recovery of the lost territory. It was 
•essentially to overhaul and revolutionize the whole gamut of 
the political life of India and to bring about a sweeping 
change in the internal life of the country. Even if Alexander 
had not died so soon, the deep-laid Indian plot was 
destined to achieve this daring political revolution. This 
sudden death of Alexander, however, gave Indian political 
workers an unexpected golden opportunity and they were 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 35 
quick enough to utilize it for the overthrow of the Greek 
power. 
GREEK GOVERNORS BEFIEADED 
79. Alexander had left behind Nicanor and Philip as the 
chief representatives of the Greeks. When the news of 
Alexander's death reached India the Indians in the republic 
of the Ashvinis suddenly fell upon the Greek Governor, Philip, 
and assassinated him along with his small Greek regiment'*. 
The second, Nicanor, was also similarly despatched,^" and all 
those monarchies and republics along the banks of the Indus 
which had acquiesced in the Greek overlordship, shook it off 
at once and proclaimed their independence forthwith. Greek 
colonies, Greek ensigns and standards—whatever signified 
the Greek power were completely destroyed on the spot. The 
whole of the tract along the banks of the Indus right from 
the Panchanad to Sindh which Alexander had conquered and 
annexed for ever and anon to his empire, became indepen­ 
dent within six months of Alexander's death*^. 
80. Alexander had conquered states and countries and 
empires like Greece, Syria, Persia, Babylon, Egypt and the 
like. There he founded Greek cities and Greek colonies, and 
even after the division of his vast empire, just after his 
death, his governors and military commanders and their 
descendants ruled the respective regions like Babylon for 
centuries together. Even now in some other countries cities 
exist with the name Alexandria, and Alexander's name is 
ever crowned with the honorifix 'The Great' throughout 
ancient history. 
81. But what happened in Bharat ? The small states 
and republics in the farthest corner of India which Alexander 
had annexed to his empire under the impression that he had 
conquered them for ever and for ever, after fighting inces­ 
santly on various battlefields for two long years and shedding 
the blood of millions of Greek and Hindu soldiers—those very 
Indian states and republics and monarchies literally uproot- 
36 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
ed his power, his standard, the Greek colonies and every 
hateful sign of the Greek v i c t r y — a n d that too within six 
months or at the most a year'^" ! 
82. At last, not to speak of the city of Alexandria which 
he had established, his own name too is not to be traced 
anywhere in Indian history, as if there never was any 
invasion, any aggression on India's borderland of any Mlenchh 
(Yavan) emperor, named Alexander, who dinned the ears of 
the people throughout Europe with his proud title, 'The 
Great' ! Curiously enough, even no stray reference has yet 
been discovered in Vedic or Jain or Buddhist ancient 
literature. 
83. Writes Vincent Smith in his famous Early History 
of India : " A l l these proceedings prove conclusively that 
Alexander intended the permanent annexation of those 
(Indian) provinces to his empire But within three years 
of his departure from India (fron 325 BC to 322 BC) his 
officers in India were ousted, his garrisons destroyed and all 
traces of his rule had disappeard. The colonies which he 
founded in India, unlike those established elsewhere in Asia­ 
tic provinces took no root. His campaign though carefully 
designed to secure a permanent conquest, was in actual effect 
no more than a brilliantly successful raid on a gigantic scale 
which left upon India no mark save the horrid scars of a 
bloody war. India remained unchanged. She continued her 
life of splendid isolation and soon forgot the passing of the 
Macedonian storm. No Indian author—Hindu, Buddhist or 
Jain—makes even the faintest allusion to Alexander or his 
deeds." (Page 117) 
84. Who were the most prominent leaders of this politi­ 
cal conspiracy which wiped out, within a period of six months 
or a year, the whole of foreign political dominance caused 
by Alexander's aggression right from the Panchanad to 
Sindh ? History as yet is ignorant of their names'" ! Still 
two of them at least have become immortal ! They are the 
same two men whom I have mentioned while describing 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 37 
Alexander's advance up to Taxila. The first was a brilliant 
and smart youth, who had just completed his studies at the 
University of Taxila^ Chandragupta ! And the other was 
Acharya Chanakya, who had been a teacher at that Univer­ 
sity and who later on gave practical lessons in political craft 
and political revolutions to the young Chandragupta ! As 
they were to lead the whole of Bharat hereafter, it is fit and 
proper that they should be introduced here. 
THE STORY OF CHANDRAGUPTA'S BIRTH 
85. Like all other great men of the ancient world 
Chandragupta and Chanakya have their life-stories clouded 
with legends, anecdotes and imaginary accounts. Those 
who are interested in them for the sake of intellectual enter­ 
tainment may profitably read Radhakumud Mukherjee's 
' Chandragupta Maurya And His Times'. We shall give here 
only so much of their lives as appear to us to have historical 
sanction. 
86. Some small bands of the Shakyas, amongst whom 
was born the great Lord Gautam Buddha, had at one time 
to shift to far off regions because of some disastrous calamity 
that had befallen them. They called themselves Kshatriyas. 
However, in those adverse days those displaced Shakyas 
began to follow other professions for their livelihood. There 
happened to be a plentiful breed of peacocks in the forest 
where these tribes later on lived. To keep these peacocks 
and sell them became one of their professions. So they had 
^Moriya' as their nickname, and the Moriyas formed a class 
by themselves. One family of these Moriyas came back to 
settle in the vicinity of Pataliputra. One woman of that 
Moriya tribe named Mura (Mayura) somehow got access to 
the harem of the royal palace and soon became the concubine 
of the Emperor, Mahapadmanand or 'Dhananand' as he was 
generally called. Her son from this Nanda Emperor was 
the same Emperor Chandragupta. 
87. However, when Chandragupta became an emperor. 
38 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
the story of his hirth might have appeared derogatory to 
his greatness and therefore in some books of the time th& 
story was slightly altered to mean that Muradevi was the 
wedded queen of the Nanda emperor, not his concubine, 
which in consequence meant that Chandragupta was a legiti­ 
mate royal prince and not an illegitimate one. 
88. But a third anecdote seems to outdo both the 
above, stories saying that Mura and Emperor Nanda were in 
no way connected. Mura had a son from her husband of the 
same clan and that son was Chandragupta himself. Later on 
with the help and guidance of Arya Chanakya and with his 
own valour he raised his poor father and mother to eminence 
and after wresting the imperial power from the Nandas he 
founded the Maurya Dynasty'*. 
89. It seems a common weakness among all human 
societies and communities, in a greater or lesser degree, to 
attempt to judge the greatness or meanness of an individual, 
not so much from his manifest virtues or vices as from the 
race, the community or the family he is born in. That is why 
as the time passes such inflated anecdotes about their family 
tradition are propagated and popularized through plays, 
poems and novels or through folk-lores. There are other 
anecdotes too besides the ones referred to above, which seek 
to ascribe greatness or meanness to Chandragupta. But for 
the reasons given above they need not be mentioned here. 
90. Was Chandragupta a concubine's son ? Was he not 
a Kshatriya ? What matters though ! Chandragupta could 
have said with justifiable pride, "More than any of you, 
nominal caste-born Kshatriyas, who bowed your heads to 
the Mlenchhas, the Greek emperor and his commanders, I, a 
'peerless' Chandragupta, have a greater claim to being a 
Kshatriya in as much as with my sword I have completely 
vanquished those very Mlenchhas in every battlefield." With 
the same haughty affront of Kama, he could have flung in 
the face of those railing enemies the following words : 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 
Heft ^T ^cT 35ft ^ jft ^"t ^^rfqiJi; ii 
tsTTira fir afrq- JT^RTT f "Tt^JI II 
— o f Bhatta Narayan, Act III, 37. 
["Whether a charioter or a charioter's son, or whoever 
(else) I may be, (that is of no consequence !) Birth in a (noble) 
family depends on fate ; but manliness depends on me !"] 
91. The son of Mura is a Maurya ! That is precisely 
why Chandragupta is called a Maurya. Proud of his maternal 
extraction Chandrgupta designated his royal family as 
Maurya and immortalized the name of his mother, Muradevi, 
in Indian history. The Maurya emperors accepted the same 
Moriya caste too, (one which traded in peacocks) that 
belonged to his m^other. The guardian deity of the Maurya 
family is also a 'Peacock'. This fact is corroborated by rock 
inscriptions. The Ashoka pillar found at Nandangad bears 
at the foot a picture of a peacock. The stories from the life 
of Ashoka inscribed on the celebrated 'stupas' at Sanchi have 
similar figures of peacock carved beside them'*", 
THE EMPEROR OF MAGADHA 
92. Mahapadmanand was the emperor ruling at that 
time over the vast Magadha empire. He was already very 
unpopular because of his many vices'*''. His subjects were 
exasperated because of the heavy taxes, levied on them in 
order to satisfy his lust for gold. People called him Dhana­ 
nand instead of Mahapadmanand in order to deride him for 
his excessive lust for money'*". He could come to the throne 
because he happened to be the brother of the earlier emperor, 
but he had not a single virtue, fit for an emperor ! He would 
have proved his worth had he but taken up the challenge of 
Alexander and crushed him in the Panchanad when the latter 
had marched on India and when he had proudly declared his 
intention of conquering Magadha and be the emperor of India. 
He should have at least undertaken such a great expedition 
as to overthrow the Greeks and free the Indian territory 
40 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
subujgated by them to deserve the title of an emperor ! But 
he did nothing of the kind, and meekly swallowed the insult 
hurled at him by Alexander ! This cowardliness on his part 
made, on the one hand, every self-respecting and nationalist 
Indian despise him, while, on the other, made him crafty. He 
hated the selfless national politicians. In order to undermine 
their prestige, he insulted them publicly. A really capable 
person was invariably an object of his hatred and was 
subjected to malicious treatment. 
93. From this Mahapadmanand, it is said, his concu­ 
bine, Mura, had the illustrious son, Chandragupta. Some 
anecdotes pertaining to Chandragupta's childhood are avail­ 
able but they are far too few and merely hearsay stories. 
What appears to be certain is only this that the cowardly 
but crafty Mahapadmanand began to fear the young Chandra­ 
gupta, shining with his sharp wit, his daring and ambitious 
spirit, seeking to exercise his rights as the heir to the throne, 
bastard as he was. He feared that under the leadership of 
this unrestrained bastard son, his antagonists would not fail 
to dethrone him ! Mahapadmanand very well knew how his 
very Nanda forerunners had vanquished the original Shishu- 
nag dynasty of Magadha and usurped the throne ! Under 
some such apprehension there appears to have occurred some 
clash which Mahapadmanand used as a pretext to banish 
Chandragupta out of the precincts of the Magadhan 
empire'**. The intervening account is permanently lost to 
oblivion. Hereafter Chandragupta makes his appearance in 
the University of Taxila (Takshasheela) as a royal prince 
having his lessons in politics and the science and art of war. 
An anecdote which is current in thafc region viz. that he got 
access to this university mainly through the good offices of 
renowned and learned Arya Chanakya may have some grain 
of truth in it". Chandragupta had already been studying 
in the manner described above at this university for about 
six or seven years when Alexander attacked India. There, 
for the first time, this illustrious disciple of Chankya, this 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 41 
young Chandragupta, began to shine with his exceptional 
brilliance in the sacred national conspiracy that was being 
batched by the Indian patriots and politicians to avenge the 
insults heaped on the Indian nation by the Greeks and to 
liberate the territory lost to them. 
A MARVELLOUS HALF HOUR IN HISTORY 
94. Young Chandragupta seems to have secretly wan­ 
dered through the Greek camps in order to study the peculiar 
features of the Greek armoury, the Greek military formations 
and war strategy. For he was once caught by the Greek 
sentries on suspicion that he was reconnoitring in the empe­ 
ror's camp'*. The report reached Alexander himself and the 
Macedonian emperor summoned the disguised Indian youth 
to his presence. Some even think that the said youth went 
to see Alexander by previous appointment. 
95. That valiant Macedonian supreme commander and 
emperor Alexander, in his thirties and the future Indian 
captain-general and emperor Chandragupta just on the 
threshold of his twenties, but as yet merely a wandering 
nonentity stood face to face sizing up each other for a few 
moments ! It appeared as if two lustrous suns, one fast 
approaching his zenith and the other not as yet risen fully 
out of the misty shroud of the early dawn, were staring at 
each other's eyes. 
96. This strange interview is not likely to have lasted 
for more than half an hour. But it has truly proved to be a 
historical marvel of perennial interest ! 
97. Even while almost all the Greek writers'* allude 
to this strange interview, nobody can say for certain what 
exactly transpired between the two or what words were 
exchanged by them. One or two of them write only this 
much that Chandragupta said distinctly that he was related 
to the royal family of Magadha or something to that 
effect'*". This much is certain that to the questions put by 
Alexander, Chandragupta answered boldly and resolutely ! 
42 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
In that strange parely something went wrong and Alexander 
ordered the youth to he taken out of the camp forthwith. 
Instantly the fiery youth left the camp, but in the mean­ 
while when Alexander changed his mind and called again 
for the youth in his presence, he was nowhere to be found 
again'**. 
T H E S T O R Y O F C H A N A K Y A ' S F A M I L Y 
98. Arya Chanakya was born in a Brahmin family and 
his name was Vishnugupta. His name Chanakya must have 
probably been derived from his native town of Chanak. But he 
is more particularly known by his name Chanakya. Koutilya 
is one more name by which he is equally well-known. His 
great and abiding work is known as Koutiliya Arthashastra^ 
Koutilya must have been formed fi'om his original family 
name qw) Kutal. He was well-versed in almost all the 
sciences of the time and was renowned at the University of 
Taxila and also amongst the learned circles of India, as a 
great scholar. He was ugly in appearance. Later on, when 
after the imperial revolution of Magadha his name gained 
great fame not only all over India but even in Greece and 
other foreign countries, as the guide and preceptor of Chan­ 
dragupta's early years and later as the chief minister of the 
Indian empire, several hearsay stories sprang up as to his early 
age, as they did regarding Chandragupta and Alexander. 
Several references to them based on solid grounds or other­ 
wise are to be found in many literary works, dramas, folk­ 
lores, written many centuries after the deaths of both 
Chandragupta and Chanakya. These references in Jain, 
Buddhist and Vedic literatures are not wholly reliable'*. Even 
in a Sanskrit drama his character has been depicted in an 
unrealistic manner for the sake of dramatic effect. As such the 
ridiculous descriptions of his ugliness or of his ungainly teeth 
or the childish reports, that he picked up from amongst the 
uneducated rustic children playing in the street one reckless 
Chandragupta to be made the future emperor of India simply 1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 43 
because he took a fancy for the child, or because his know­ 
ledge of palmistry guided his choice, cannot be taken as 
historical truths. However, more discerning research-workers 
should necessarily investigate if there is any basis for them. 
THE PERVERTED REPORT OF CHANAKYA'S VOW 
99. One such anecdote about Arya Chanakya should be 
discussed here as an illustration. For, it is being taught in 
the present-day schools in that very perverted form. The 
said anecdote purports to say that because he became famous 
as a great scholar in the University of Taxila (Ta.kshasheela) 
and the regions round about, Arya Chanakya was appointed 
as the Chairman of the Grants Commission (^sn'siw) in the 
royal palace of Mahapadmanand at Pataliputra". While 
he M'as working in that high office. Emperor Mahapadmanand 
came there one day on his inspection rounds. But he laughed 
at his teethless ugly mouth and his unshapely body, at which 
Chanakya took a great affront. Therefore, Nanda pulled him 
down instantly and, as is written in some books, pulled his 
tuft of hair till it was uprooted and finally ordered him to 
be driven out of the palace. The fiery Brahmin instantly 
retorted saying "I shall drag you down from your throne and 
completely destroy the Nanda dynasty and then and then 
alone shall tie up my tuft of bair." With this grave vow he 
marched straight out of the palace''. 
100. But let it be remembered that Emperor Nanda had 
come there to inspect the work of the Charity Department, 
not to visit a beauty parlour I How is it plausible, then, 
that Mahapadmanand who had himself appointed that learned 
scholar to the high office of the President of the Charitable 
Grants Department, would now say that because of his ugly 
features Arya Chanakya was unfit for that post ? The office 
of the Chairman of the said Grants Department required the 
expert knowledge of the religious sciences and judicial proce­ 
dure, not physical beauty ! But there is a more potent objec­ 
tion than this one to disprove this foolish anecdote. This 
44 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
anecdote implies that Chanakya revolted against Emperor 
Nanda because of his personal insult alone, and that, had he 
not been thus insulted, he would have remained a loyal 
servant of Mahapadmanand, that the India-wide revolution 
that he successfully brought about was not for the sake of 
freeing the Indian land from the foreign Mlenchcha domina­ 
tion, but only to avenge his personal insult! For this very 
reason this anecdote is clearly perverted. 
101. When as a strategy in politics Shivaji went to 
Agra accepting the overlordship of Aurangzeb, the latter 
insulted him, and when there was a clash of words, Shivaji 
was put under arrest. But Shivaji slipped away most miracu­ 
lously and skilfully and declared war against Aurangzeb. 
If, after telling this story, any wiseacre were to conclude that 
it was because be was personally insulted that Shivaji bore a 
grudge against Aurangzeb and established an independent 
kingdom for himself, that he had no higher motive of the 
emancipation of his religion and country, it would be the 
height of absurdity and foolishness. Equally absurd and 
foolish would it be to say that it was only to avenge his perso­ 
nal insult by Emperor Nanda that Arya Chanakya brought 
about a pohtical revolution by exterminating the Nanda 
dynasty. 
THAT ANECDOTE SHOULD BE EXPLAINED THUS 
102. It is not true to say that because of his personal 
insult Shivaji revolted against Aurangzeb. On the contrary, 
Aurangzeb had taken a fright that it is to overthrow his alien 
religious domination that Shivaji had taken arms, fired as he 
was with a glowing fervour for Hindutwa. That is why he 
insulted Shivaji and relegated him to captivity ! In a similar 
way because Mahapadmanand had secret reports that, avail­ 
ing himself of the weakness of the reigning monarch, Arya 
Chanakya was busy conspiring against him so as to overthrow 
the Nanda empire, the Emperor Nanda insulted him in his 
royal palace and at that very moment the illustrious Brahmin 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 45 
Arya Chanakya retorted boldly, 'If I am a true Chanakya I shall see to it that your tyrannical rule is overthrown so that Bharat might prosper". This is how the anecdote should be explained. 
103. A very solid proof for this is available to us in the very Koutiliya Arthashastra written by Chanakya himself. While introducing the writer it is said (in the very book)— 
'^vtsm f^r^: 5ft^: ^im w 
— " g s m ^ ^<ft??ITT Telang's edition P. 44 
—^I'q^nf'I P. 429 
"He who destroyed the Nanda and rejuvenated the national armed strength, as also the national scientific advance, which were decaying under the Nanda regime and thus caused the uplift of his Bharatbhoomi, has written this treatise." He has not used even a single word in these introductory lines to say that he destroyed Nanda to avenge his personal insult. It is for the progress and prosperity of his own nation and motherland that Nanda was destroyed ! Chanakya's great work itself tells it clearly ! 
104. The anecdote which is told in a downright drama­ tic way perhaps means only this, that his original nationalis­ tic animus towards Nanda was whetted the more because of this personal insult. 
CHANAKYA'S POLITICAL ACTIVITIES PRECEDED ALEXANDER'S ONSLAUGHT 
105. Chanakya had been living in the vicinity of Taxila good many years before the aggression of Alexander'*. He had a first-hand knowledge of the political situation in the Bharatiya frontier territories right up to the Indus. 
106. Just adjoining the borderland of India had stret­ ched far and wide the unitary and centrally well organized 
46 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
nation, inimical to India. Chanakya was shrewd enough to 
understand that in the event of an aggression by such a 
well-organised and inimical country, the small native demo­ 
cracies and monarchies from the Panchanad to the Indus 
would utterly fail in the open battlefield, if they were to 
iight separately. 
T H E G R E E K C I T Y - S T A T E S T O O P E R I S H E D 
PRECISELY FOR THIS REASON 
107. Just then a practical demonstration of the above- 
mentioned axiom took place in Greece. The moment the 
Persian Emperor invaded Greece the small Greek city-states 
like their prototypes in India, were convulsed to their bones. 
In the end, it is only when Philip and Alexander conquered 
all of those separatist Greek city-states and forged them into 
a powerful empire was it possible for then; to vanquish the 
Persian empire. Chanakya was not slow to understand its 
significance. 
108. He arrived at the firm conviction that vis-a-vis a 
powerful and extensive inimical empire as its neighbour, 
India had only one way to defend its independence and make 
its administrative machinery strong enough to withstand 
any foreign aggression and that was to boil down all the 
smaller monarchies and republics and to forge out of them a 
•centralized, unitary and strong empire. 
FOR THE ENTIRE UNDIVIDED INDIA 
108-A. But there was not a single Indian monarchy or 
republic throughout the whole of the region right from 
Gandhar, Panjab to the Indus delta, which could execute 
this plan of Chanakya, who had already appraised their 
capability and inclination. Naturally his next choice fell 
on the only mighty empire of North India, namely Magadha. 
His head full of plans for the future Indian revolution, Arya 
Chanakya came again to Magadha in order to study secretly 
the political situation visiting every place right from a poor 
r • 1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 47 
man's cottage to the royal palace. As such he was trying 
to get access to the King's court on some pretext or the 
other. When the question of the appointment of Arya 
Chanakya as the Chairman of the 'Grants' department' 
(?lsilE?lw) was mooted Nanda did not object to it because till 
then he had known nothing else of Arya Chanakya, but of his 
scholarship. This appointment greatly helped Arya Chanakya 
to perfect his secret revolutionary plans. 
109. But before long Emperor Nanda had reports that 
Arya Chanakya was not a scholar pure and simple, but an 
expert organiser of secret plots and was at that time busy 
plotting against him. Enraged at this, he publicly insulted 
Arya Chanakya as already told before, deprived him of his 
authority as the Chairman of the Grants' Department, and 
expelled him out of his imperial precincts. Being thus 
outlawed, Chanakya returned again to Taxila. 
110. In the meanwhile, the young bastard son Chandra­ 
gupta being exiled, as has been already told, from the 
Magadhan court by Emperor Nanda, went to Taxila and 
joined Chanakya—an incident which proved most favourable 
to that patriot's ambitous plans of establishing an all-India 
empire. 
WHY DID CHANAKYA BACK CHANDRAGUPTA 
ALONE? 
111. If he were to dethrone the weak and wicked Nanda 
and crown in his place on the throne of the Magadha empire 
any outsider, the tradition-loving important persons from 
amongst the feudatories, the Indian princes and even the 
common people would probably have opposed vehemently, 
even though the chosen person had been endowed with the most 
excellent qualities whereas Chandragupta, though not a 
lawful royal prince had some native blood-relation to the 
throne as the bastard son of the Emperor of Magadha. He 
was, moreover endowed with valour and other qualities of 
head and heart. As such the arch-diplomat Chanakya 
48 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
shrewdly guessed that even these votaries of tradition were 
far less likely to oppose Chandragupta's election to the 
throne of Magadha. He, therefore, determined to champion 
the claim of Chandragupta to the emperorship of Magadha— 
why even to that of the whole of India." 
112. While the grand plan of an India-wide empire of 
Chanakya-and-Chandragupta was thus being set afoot the un­ 
fortunate event of a foreign invasion was reported towards 
Persia. Alexander had already destroyed the empire of Persia 
and had invaded India. Although, as has been related in the 
foregoing page, he was staunchly opposed by the Bharatiya 
valour and forced to retreat home, it was plain that Alexan­ 
der's well organized imperial military might was not totally 
annulled. 
113. Even out of this evil some good did emerge. The 
republican subjects of the frontier regions, with their faith 
in democratic principles shaken rudely by the heavy knock 
of a foreign invasion and the bloody wars that followed, 
began to agree with Chanakya and other patriotic prophets 
that national independence was in peril unless a countrywide 
Indian empire was established on the lines of the vast, 
highly centralized, well-organized and unitary form of empire 
of the enemy. 
114. The first happy sign of this revolutionary spirit 
was seen in the general uprising throughout the smaller 
states and republics, conquered by Alexander and annexed 
to his empire, and in the fact that hardly within six months 
or a year of Alexander's death these Indian territories shook 
off the foreign rule and became independent. Justin, an 
ancient, renowned writer, credits the leadership of Chandra­ 
gupta with the authorship of this wonderful and noble 
collective uprising. "India after the death of Alexander had 
shaken, as it were, the yoke of servitude from its neck 
and put his governors to death. The author of this libera­ 
tion was Sandrocottus." The 'Sandrocottus' of this quotation 
is Chandragupta. The Greeks pronounced the name of 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 
Chandragupta in this very way. 
THE ONLY WAY TO REPEL RE-INVASION ? 
115. Although the general rising in these frontier pro­ 
vinces was successful under the guidance of Chandragupta, 
Chanakya and others, the followers of Chanakya began to 
warn all princes and political leaders, that it had not as yet 
made Indian independence completely safe from the future 
Greek onslaught. They went on preaching everywhere that 
Alexander himself had vowed till the day of his death that 
he would invade India once again and conquer it thoroughly, 
that the "chief officers of his state and commanders were at 
war with one another for the division of the Greek empire, 
that the triumphant one among them who would ascend the 
throne at Babylon would not fail to attack India with an 
army more powerful than before and that the first victims to 
that aggression would be these very people, if they remained 
disunited as separate Rajakas (monarchies) and Prajakas 
(republics). But if they availed themselves of this opportu­ 
nity of the civil feuds of the Greeks and if they could merge 
the whole of India into a strong empire with an efficient 
administration at the centre, this new Indian empire stronger 
than that of the Greeks, could very easily beat the MIenchchsas 
were they to come once again aggressively. Hence they said 
India should be built into one strong nation ! 
INVASION OF CHANDRAGUPTA AND CHANAKYA 
ON MAGADHA 
116. Without wasting even a single moment of the 
golden opportunity of the Greek internecine wars, Chandra­ 
gupta and other followers of Chanakya began openly to raise 
a powerful army to march first of all against Magadha 
according to Chanakya's plan of the political revolution. A 
few but very telling references to this fact are to be found 
in the critique named 'Mahavamsha''". From these and 
from other sources it appears that this invading army of 
60 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Chandragupta was mainly composed of the soldiers from 
Panchanad, the Pauravas and the republics who were inspired 
with the preaching of Chanakya for a unitary Indian empire. 
In order to enlist the sympathies of the Parvateshwara i.e. 
King Paurav, who was a powerful king in those provinces 
Chanakya is said to have met him secretly. As Alexander's 
sway had been completely thrown off from the Indian 
territories. King Paurav was no longer a subordinate satrap 
•of the Greeks. From stray references in some books it appears 
-that not only King Paurav offered his support for Chanakya's 
cause, but some wealthy people too helped him actively. 
•Chanakya offered the command of the whole army to Chandra­ 
gupta. After establishing their hold on all possible regions of 
Panchanad, they marched speedily on Magadha*^. The Indian 
populace and the local powers disgusted with and enraged 
at the tyrannical and weak rule of the Nanda and inspired 
by Chanakya's ideal of a strong unitary empire of the whole 
of India, joined Chandragupta's army as it marched ahead 
fighting**. 
117. In this daring and stormy march of theirs Chan­ 
dragupta and Chanakya had many times to face very grave 
dangers to their lives. Once their whole army was routed by 
a violent knock of the opposing forces and both Chandragupta 
and Chanakya had to flee into the forest to save their lives*'. 
One night they had to sleep on the bare hard ground, but 
undeterred by any of these calamities, Chandragupta and 
Chanakya formed their armies again and'again and kept on 
marching ahead and in the end entered the precincts of 
Pataliputra, the Magadhan capital itself. 
118. The arch-diplomat, Chanakya, had bribed the 
army and the people in the capital of Nanda. On the strength 
of this general sedition the daring Chandragupta fell like an 
arrow-shot upon the city of Pataliputra. 
MAHAPADMANAND BEHEADED 
119. When Chandragupta's army rushed into the capital, 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 61 
blocking it very rigidly from every side there was a great 
havoc everywhere. Chandragupta himself enterd the royal 
palace, but Mahapadmanand had already left it in the general 
disorder that had ensued and was trying to slip out of the 
capital secretly. He was, however, caught on the way and 
beheaded almost instantaneously**. 
SAMRAT CHANDRAGUPTA KI JAYA ! 
120. Chandragupta was soon proclaimed Emperor of 
Magadha. He adopted Maurya as his family name after that 
of his mother, Mura. Hence he and his royal dynasty came 
to be known for ever in history by that very name 'Maurya'. 
As soon as he publicly ascended the throne of Magadha he 
appointed Chanakya as the Chief Minister of the empire, 
approximately in B.C. 32PS. 
121. Alexander died round about B.C. 323. It means, 
therefore, that within about two years Samrat Chandragupta 
and Chanakya effected this gigantic revolution which establi­ 
shed the indepedent and powerful Indian empire dispelling 
all gloom of despondency and disintegration, while on the 
other side the Greek feudal lords were quarrelling amongst 
themselves**. In order to avail himself fully of this opportu­ 
nity, Chanakya immediately busied himself with the establi­ 
shment of internal peace and order. 
T H E B A S I C P R I N C I P L E O F C H A N A K Y A ' S P O L I T I C A L 
THEORY—MILITARY MIGHT FIRST 
122. But the peace and order of even a unitary empire 
ultimately depends on its militarj' strength alone which forms 
the bed-rock of the whole imperial structure. This was the 
basic principle of Chanakya's political theory. Warlike 
spirit and armed-strength, he said, were the very life-breath 
not only of the political but also the civil life of a commu­ 
nity. Let that warlike spirit mitigate itself a bit and all 
religions, all sciences, all arts, why the whole life of a nation, 
is doomed ! 
52 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
'In the event of the Kshatriyas forsaking their old kingly 
duty all the religions are (hound) to perish'. A huge building 
without a (proper) foundation, as also, an empire without an 
(adequate) military strength are bound to topple down 
even with a stormy wave of wind. Arya Chanakya, who 
preached all this, first of all began to reorganize a huge 
powerful army, which was well-commanded and inspired with 
the ambition to win in order to defend the newly-born 
empire. This he did with such an amazing speed that during 
three or four years not only his subjects came to have faith 
in his great powers but also the enemies of India began to 
fear it. 
123. What did this huge army of Chandragupta so well 
planned and so well organised amount to ? 
124. Hardly four years earlier when Chandragupta- 
Chanakya vowed secretly to establish an independent Indian 
empire under a unitary command their armed might was 
literally nil ! That very Chandragupta who started with this 
'nil' had now a well-equipped loyal army of 6,00,000 foot 
soldiers, 30,000 cavalry 2,000 war-elephants and 4,000 
chariots*'! 
125. With this powerful army, Chanakya wiped out the 
chaos created by the separatist small states, republics and 
monarchies in north India which wanted to lead an inde­ 
pendent life of their own, and established peace and unitary 
organization. In the end all the territory on this side of the 
Indus up to the Panjab, the Kingdom of the Pauravas and 
Sindh proper were annexed to the Mauryan empire**. 
126. Had any political thinker and administrator or an 
Indian emperor felt proud to have established for the first 
time such a unitary Bharatiya emperor, it would have been 
but natural. 
INDIA'S FRONTIER HINDUKUSH NOT INDUS 
127. But Chandragupta and Chanakya were not satisfied 1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 53 
with extending the boundaries of their empire up to the 
banks of the Indus only, they had vowed to establish the 
Bharatiya empire over the whole of India and to annihilate 
the unruly Mlenchchas ! At that time the (north western), 
frontier of India did not rest with the eastern bank of the 
Indus. But it reached much farther beyond the Indus so as 
to include among its fold the regions like the Gandhar and 
the rivers now lost to Afghanisthan, but once well-known to 
Vedic Aryans, like the Kubha (the Kabul of today) the Kramu 
(the Kurram of today), the Suwastu (the Swat of today), the 
Gomati (the Gumal of today) and others, right up to the 
peaks of the Hindukush mountains^o". To that far end 
were spread our repubhcs following the Vedic religion and 
born of a Bharatiya race ! And over these regions had been 
ruling the traditional royal dynasties of India. As our 
people in that ice-cold regions were comparatively whiter it 
was also called by some "White India"^"^. Naturally the 
national aspiration, as embodied in Chandragupta-Chanakya 
scheme of things, fortified its imperial boundaries not only 
up to the eastern bank of the Indus with a strong army, but 
it also busied itself with the planning and preparation and 
execution of the extension of the imperial boundaries right 
up to the natural geographic frontiers of India, the Hindukush 
mountain, and yearned to hoist its flag on the top of that 
mountain. 
"These also laboured in the cause espoused by the other sages." 
GREEK FEUDS AND THE DIVISION OF THE EMPJLRE 
128. In the meanwhile, the Greek civil feuds had tem­ 
porarily ceased by dividing Alexander's empire, ceding its 
vast portion from the Indian frontiers up to Babylon to 
Seleucos Nicator, one of the bravest and most experienced 
veteran of Alexander's military ofiicers, who ruled it as an 
independent sovereign^"*. He was supposed to inherit the 
54 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
claim to the region beyond the Hindukush which was formely 
conquered by Alexander. 
129. He, therefore, demanded the surrender of that 
region from Chandragupta who had appropriated it to him- 
self^"^. Of course, Seleucos did not realize that now the Greeks 
had to face not an Ambhi of Taxila as before, nor any cowardly 
minister, but King Chandragupta and his minister, Chanakya 1 
They not only scoffed at this frivolous demand of Seleucos but 
demanded in return the surrender of the region from Gandhar 
to Hindukush beyond the river Indus^"*. 
SELEUCOS ATTACKS INDIA WITH A MIGHTY ARMY 
130. Enraged at this rebuff, Seleucos marched against 
India round about 315 B.C. with a Greek army, trained under 
Alexander^"*. If we leave aside the little-known invasion of 
Gandhar by Alexander in B.C. 329, this was the second inva­ 
sion of India by the Greeks after the famous one, already 
fully described, by Alexander in B. C. 326. 
131. But this time, after he crossed the Indus, Seleucos 
was amazed to see that the region instead of being divided 
into separate Indian republics as at the time of Alexander 
had undergone a complete change, both political and military, 
because of the brave efforts of Chandragupta and Chanakya. 
He was confused. Right from the northernmost part of the 
Panjab, on the bank of the Indus, to the waters of the 
Western Sea (Sindhusagar) he saw erected, as it were, a steel 
wall of well organized, centrally controlled fourfold Indian 
army to check his advance ! And at the head of it was 
Chandragupta himself !! 
132. As soon as the two armies thirsting to fight met, 
a bitter war started. The Greeks did their utmost but at last 
the Indian forces on two or three battle-fields somewhere on 
the banks of the Indus (the place or places are unknown yet), 
put them to such a pitiful rout that Seleucos could not help 
capitulating to the victorious Chandragupta^"*. 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 55. 
REVENGE OF THE DEFEAT OF KING PAURAV 
133. Thus was avenged by this decisive victory of 
Chandragupta over the vanquished Greeks the old sore of the , 
defeat of King Paurav and other atrocities and insults meted 
out to the Indians by Alexander ! So— 
THE VANQUISHED SELEUCOS MEEKLY ACCEPTED 
ALL THE TERMS OF THE VICTORIOUS 
CHANDRAGUPTA"'. 
134. According to these terms of the treaty, Seleucos 
relinquished his right to the Indian region this side of the 
Indus which he had so far maintained. But when he was firmly 
told by Chief Minister Chanakya that the war would not 
end unless the whole region from Gandhar to Hindukush, 
which was till then in the Greek hands, was yielded to the 
Indian Emperor, he submitted to it meekly and the thousands 
of Greek warriors who proudly held their brave chests and 
their swords drawn up v/hile crossing the Indus on their 
march against India, now returned crest-fallen, with their 
heads and swords held down. They crossed not only the 
Indus backwars but retreated to the farthest end of the 
Hindukush mountain"'. 
LOVE IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT FEAR 
fsTT ftir q- sft?] 
135. This singular victory of Chandragupta brought the 
Indian frontiers quite close to those of the Greek empire of 
Seleucos and the dividing line between the two empires was 
the range of the Hindukush mountain ! The might of this 
Indian emperor and the personality of Chandragupta and 
Chanakya impressed the Greek Emperor, Seleucos, so much 
that he was fully convinced of the advisability of having 
friendly relations with such a mighty empire than to be on 
inimical terms with it ! Secondly, Seleucos had enemies on 
the other frontiers although they too were Greeks. Friend­ 
ship with Chandragupta, therefore, was calculated to overawe 
56 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
them too ! For these reasons the Greek Emperor, Seleucos, 
whole-heartedly signed a treaty of permanent peace with 
Emperor Chandragupta^"*. 
136. Moreover, with a view to cementing this political 
and international friendship with a wedlock between the two 
royal families and personal affinities and ties, the Greek 
emperor celebrated the marriage of his daughter with Chand- 
ragupta"!. 
137. This offer of the royal princess in marriage by 
Seleucos erected a golden pinnacle bedecked with jewels 
over the magnificent temple of the success of Emperor 
Chandragupta! 
THE GLORIOUS TREATISE OF MAHAMATYA 
CHANAKYA! 
138. How very effectively and firmly with full regard to 
the propriety of the case and yet how very discreetly Chana­ 
kya managed the affairs of the state can be clearly seen from 
his treatise on body politic named Kautileeya Arthashastra 
and from the far-reaching influence of the invincible Indian 
Empire which kept on increasing for at least a hundred years 
afterwards. The account of Megasthenese, the Greek ambas­ 
sador at the court of Chandragupta, also testifies to the part 
this Treatise played in maintaining peace and order and 
affluence in the whole empire'". 
139. At times a single historical event happening over­ 
night or within a single day changes the whole current of 
history for over a thousand years to come. This decisive 
victory of Chandragupta over the Greeks had also had far- 
reaching effects. The English historian, Vincent Smith, has 
this remark to offer : "For almost a hundred years after the 
failure of Seleucos Nikator no Greek sovereign presumed to 
attack India". 
140. "•••The first Indian emperor, more than two thous­ 
and years ago thus entered into possession of that "Scientific 
frontier" sighed for in vain by his English successors and 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH 57; 
never held in its entirety even by the Moghul monarchs of* the 16th and 17th centuries {Early History of India, 4th ed. 
1924 by V.A. Smith, P. 126). 
DID ALEXANDER CONQUER INDIA ? NO. ; 
141. In the ancient period throughout the whole of Europe Greek civilization was the only one which was far ahead t of others. Almost all the modern nations of Europe, therefore,; rever it as their source. Naturally the name of a valiantr Greek emperor of that time like Alexander is, therefore, a: source of living inspiration to them. The European histories, therefore, call him "Alexander the Great" and many anecdotes 
•and legends in the mythical manner are colourfully taught to the young pupils through their history text-books. But the 
•commonly educated European people—not of course, the few learned historians—are blissfully ignorant of thet hen Indian antogonists of Alexander and his Greek empire, Chandragupta, 
•and his minister, Chanakya ! Such perversion of history can be overlooked so far as the European people are concerned. But after the establishment of the British rule over India in 
•our schools and colleges too the same disproportionate praises were sung of Alexander in the history text-books and other types of literature. Because three or four generations of ours have been imparted the same English education, our educated classes are also impressed by the name Alexander the Great. But they too probably never knew who Chandragupta or Chanakya was. This perversion of history and the misun­ derstanding it has created in the minds of our people should no more be tolerated hereafter. We may not mind the other traditional anecdotes about Alexander, but those at least which are connected with Indian history and which extol Alexander disproportionately to the derogation of the Indian people, must be deleted from our school text-books and from our literature. Take for example, the one colourfully told in the school and college books of Europe and other types 
•of literature and which was widely published in our country 
58 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
also by the English. 
142. The Greeks and the other European people believed 
that Alexander was a world-conqueror and he had conquered 
the whole of India. When that war-like Emperor returned 
home after his world-conquest, he is said to have burst into 
tears at the sad thought that no more country remained for 
him to be conquered. This anecdote about Alexander is 
proudly told not only in Europe but even in India ! Now it 
can be very clearly seen how very absurd and ludicrous this 
belief is from the short account given earlier in these pages. 
To the great nation of those times, China, he never turned 
his face. But even if we leave this fact aside, we have already 
shown how he was baffled and made to retreat when he came 
conquering to the Western frontiers of India with the ambi­ 
tious design to conquer the Empire of Magadha and the rest 
of India and how his aspirations were defeated. Alexander 
was brave, Alexander was a conqueror ! But he was not a 
world-conqueror I Conqueror of India he never was !! If at 
all that valiant hero was really moved to tears it was impossi­ 
ble that his tears should have been caused by the thought 
that there was no other country left for conquest I For he 
himself knew that it was false. His tears then must have- 
been caused by the sad realization that he was not able to- 
defeat India completely which he longed so much to conquer. 
On the contrary he must have been much disturbed by the 
thought that even the small corner of India that he believed 
he was able to conquer was also very likely to be wrenched' 
from his hands by the rebellious Indians ! 
142. A As it is said in the poem "Gomantak" 
[Of whomsoever else he might be the conqueror, Alexander- 
was never the conqueror of India ! He did not even see the- 
courtyard (of the palatial edifice) of India, and to many- 
others he was never known(even by name) !] 
1ST GLORIOUS EPOCH SUPER ALEXANDER ! 
143. Great men should ordinarily be never compared 
with one another. They are great in various ways, but if 
anybody tries to compare any such and extol the one to the 
derogation of the other, this hoax must be exposed and refuted 
completely. So long as Europe eulogizes Alexander alone as 
'the Great' and tries to brow-beat his antagonist, Emperor 
Chandragupta, by evading any reference to him, we Indians 
must need assert that if at all they are to be compared, 
Chandragupta was Super-Alexander in comparison with 
Alexander ! Alexander ascended the throne of a strong 
nation, already won by his father and commanded an army 
that was also formed by King Philip. On the strength of 
this ancestral inheritance he bravely built up a strong Greek 
empire ! But Chandragupta enjoyed no such heritage ! He 
had not a single soldier under his command ; besides he had 
been banished from his ancestral empire by his father ! Only 
one man was at his side; it was Arya Chanakya ! Under these 
circumstances he had to start anew ! Yet he built up a 
mighty army, conquered the ancestral empire, and wiping 
out the Greek conquests under Alexander himself and under 
his general Seleucos Nicator, founded an Indian empire 
mightier even than that of Alexander himself !

145. Emperor Chandragupta expired in 298 B.C.^. He was succeeded by his son, Bindusar, who was also brave. He took for himself the epithet 'Amitraghat' (the annihi- lator of enemies^. Even after the death of Chandragupta the ministership rested with Chanakya at least for some time*. Naturally, Bindusar took upon himself the task of Chanakya and Chandragupta, which was left half accomp­ lished at the latter's death, (cf : paragraphs 108 to 127) According to the plan, the Yavanas were sorely beaten, the whole of India was once again free, and there was established as far as north India was concerned, a centrally administered unitary form of strong empire. But their avowed objective was the consolidation of the whole of India under one Supreme ruler, for the sake of which it was his duty to as­ similate South India into the Mauryan empire of the north ! 
146. Although the several states in South India at the time belonged to our own people, they were independent in their own ways, and were absolutely free from any kind of foreign domination. It was, however, necessary that they should have merged their separate existence into the north 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 61 
Indian empire if the whole of India was to be one indivisible nation with a central authority to guide its destiny. To do so was their national duty ! 
147. Once he started on his Southern campaign, Empe­ ror Bindusar made almost all of the Southern States and principalities accept his sovereignty either by peace talks, by grants of money or by threats of violence or even by sowing seeds of sedition*. It is recorded in history that he annexed seventeen capitals (with their states) between the eastern and the western seas to the Maurya empire. It seems that he brought the whole of the northern, southern eastern and western India under his sole command and accomplished the ideal of the India-wide unitary empire. Besides this, the Maurya empire of Bindusar was unique in as much as, even according to the standards of history, India was the mightiest, in its military sense, of all the nations of the then known world. 
148. It was because of the invincible four-fold armed strength built up according to the precepts of Chanakya, that from Chandragupta's accession to the throne of Magadha to the time when Asoka courted Buddhism and even till his death i.e. for about a hundred years, no enemy from the outside world could give any kind of offence to this All- India Maurya Empire, either by land or sea or by crossing any frontier whatsoever ! 
A S O K A T H E H O L Y ! 
149. Samrat Bindusar died in 273 B.C.*. His son, Asoka, ascended the throne after him by putting aside his elder brother*. Emperor Asoka truly deserved to be includ­ ed in the list of virtuous and holy kings not only of India but of the world. However, according to the criterion laid down in paragraphs 7 to 9 of this book the Asokan epoch does not fit in properly in the scope of the glorious epochs. Hence we cannot do anything more than bypass him with only a slight reference. 
62 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
150. But after his conversion to Buddhism, Asoka carried 
out an excessive propaganda in favour of certain Buddhist 
principles like Ahimsa and the rest which have caused so 
much harm to the Indian political outlook, her political inde­ 
pendence, and her empire, that it has become absolutely 
necessary to discuss at some length here as well as in other 
chapters, not only the principles of Asoka but also those of 
Buddhism and their practices. 
HAIL TO LORD BUDDHA ! 
161. Before discussing here some of the anti-national 
Buddhist preachings and practices and their effects, I consi­ 
der it my duty to state in the beginning—so that there may 
not be any misunderstanding or perversion of my views-that 
on the whole, I have a very high regard for Lord Buddha 
and his religion. In Indian history there are several lofty 
Himalayan peaks of world famous personalities, and the 
name of one of those sublime heights is Bhagwan Buddha ! 
As regards this reverence for him, I too, would gladly join his 
disciples in bowing down my head before his idol, saying 
'Hail to thee, 0 Lord Buddha !' The Hindu nation too, which 
gave birth to such a divine considers him the ninth incarna­ 
tion of Lord Vishnu. 
C A U S E S O F T H E D E C L I N E O F B U D D H I S M IN INDIA 
152. The Buddhist cult for that matter was being 
preached in the vicinity of Magadha at least three hundred 
years before Asoka. It was mostly propagated, till then, by 
persuasion and conviction, on matters of principles. Natur­ 
ally its progress was slow. It has already been pointed out 
in Paragraph No. 16 that till the time of Alexander and 
Seleucos Buddhist religion was hardly known in the 
Panjab, Sindh, Gandhar and other provinces. The Greeks 
knew nothing of it. Good many historians are under the 
impression that because Buddhism did not regard the autho­ 
rity of the Vedas as the highest and because on the whole it 2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 63 
appeared on the whole atheistic, the followers of the Vedic 
religion at that time opposed it very vehemently and as 
such the Buddhist religion was exterminated from India. But 
this belief, firmly established in the minds of the people 
throughout the ages till the very present day, is not wholly 
right; for, the belief that Lord Buddha founded any non- 
Vedic atheistic cult is in itself wrong. Round about the 
t i m e G a u t a m B u d d h a w a s b o r n t h e r e w e r e n e a r l y fifty 
or sixty creeds in vogue' and this the Buddhist books them­ 
selves admit as true. It was customary to hold intellectual 
debates of the Vedic and non-Vedic philosophies. Whoever 
was convinced by persuasion and discussion adopted freely 
the religion he liked. Although it is true that Buddhism 
suffered a sort of defeat in this philosophical and intellectual 
warfare that went on throughout the long period from the 
days of the Buddha to those of Shankaracharya, the disgust 
and hatred which the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas and the 
other Hindu people felt for the Buddhist sect and the corrupt 
practices they followed were mainly due not to the philoso­ 
phical or intellectual, but to the national and political rea­ 
sons. How all this happened will be explained so far as the 
scope of this book will permit. 
ASOKA ENFORCES BUDDHISM 
153. After courting the Buddhist cult, Asoka became 
such a great zealot of his new religion towards the end of his 
career that he was not satisfied with persuasive type of 
religious conversion so far prevalent in society. He declared 
as penal all those Vedic religious practices which were taboo 
from the point of view of the Buddhists but which were the 
very foundation of Vedic religion. For want of space we shall 
cite not more than two or three instances. He banned all 
those sacrifices throughout his empire which admitted of 
violence*. Sacrifice was the mainstay of the Vedic religion, 
r o u n d w h i c h t h e B h a r a t i y a c i v i l i z a t i o n h a d flourished 
ever since the Vedic period. The discontent, therefore, that 
64 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
must have been caused amongst the eighty per cent of the 
population which comprised Brahmins, Kshatriyas and 
other Vedic people when those sacrifices were declared penal 
offences by the government, can best be imagined. Ashoka 
even banned hunting®. The Vedic religion considered 
hunting as one of the essential duties of a Kshatriya. Not 
only was it forbidden by Asoka to kill fish and fowl for the 
food of millions of people, but simply for upholding the 
extremist principle of the Buddhistic 'total Ahimsa'. If 
practised sincerely and without making any exceptions, these 
principles prove utterly harmful to mankind. It was also 
declared unlawful to hunt wild beasts like lions and tigers 
which very often broke upon human habitations and caused 
great distress by carrying away men and animals^". While 
he was thus tyrannically overriding the religious practices of 
the Brahmin-Kshatriya and Vedic people", Asoka went on 
erecting great pillars and inscribed thereon his famous edicts 
enjoining on his subjects to be tolerant to all religionists, to 
give respect to the Shramanas (ascetics) and Brahmins alike. 
It is really strange that an emperor, calm, cool, composed 
and considerate, like Asoka, should not be able to realize the 
inconsistency between his precept and practice. 
164. Nearly fifty years before Asoka, Chanakya had 
already visualized the inevitable, horrible effect of some of 
the teachings of the Buddhist cult on the national strength 
and the foundation of the society as a whole. As such in 
his famous political treatise, "Arthashastra", on which was 
erected the whole edifice of the Maurya empire, he had laid 
down certain restrictions which were essential from the 
national point of view, on those who thought of leaving the 
worldly life and become 'bhikkus'. For instance, one of the 
Chanakyan rules forbade a minor girl to enter the Buddha 
'Sangham' without the express permission of her parents and 
the government. Another of his rules prohibited every 
several man from becoming a 'bhikku', unless and until he 
had provided amply for dependants, his wife and children^^. 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 65 
But during the reign of Asoka and later also these restric­ tions disappeared, and every man or woman, young or old, became absolutely free to renounce the worldly ways to enter the Buddhistic Sanghas. Thousands of these 'bhikkus' i n the 'Sanghas' were allowed free food, clothing, beddings and abodes as charities, at the cost of the state. Asoka spent crores of rupees from the imperial treasury on building gigantic viharas and on the maintenance of millions of such bhikkus living in them^'. The major part of the revenue- collection of the imperial treasury was made from the estates of the Vedic Hindus, yet it was spent on the universal propaganda of the Buddhistic sect which antagonised them. This squandering away of their wealth for the growth of their antagonists naturally bred great discontent among the Vedic populace. 
A B L O W T O T H E I M P E R I A L M I G H T ! 
155. This excessive propaganda for unrestricted ahimsa 
which Asoka carried on by the use of his political authority 
throughout his empire and the countries beyond it, cut at the 
very root of the Indian empire and was even more harmful 
than any other acts of his for the national existence and 
national independence" ! Thousands of bhikkus, appointed 
and maintained by Asoka preached everywhere that army 
strength of every sort was violent and sinful, and that all 
those who followed the life of a Kshatriya were violent and 
so irreligious ! Everyone who vowed to practise 'ahimsa', 
everyone who renounced the use of weapons and his family- 
life and lived the life of a 'bhikku' in the viharas according 
to the Buddhistic principles was greater, holier and so more 
praiseworthy than the brave Kshatriya soldier who fought 
and bled and died in the defence of his nation. Naturally 
the common people too came to think that any and every 
wandering parasite of a 'bhikku' was more respectable and 
religious-minded than the brave armed warrior^*. 
156. Asoka had precept, commonly preached by other 
religions also, inscribed on his.'pillars' : Religious victory is 
66 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
more valuable than the one gained by means of arms !" But 
•was this religious victory possible in this earthly life ? Was 
it practical ? A draught of nectar is said to make a man 
immortal; may be ! But can anybody tell the whereabouts of 
the shop where that nectar is available ? 
156-A. [Whoever can satisfy his hunger by eating the 
rice and curry made of words ?] 
167. Was not the empire of Asoka with the unlimited 
resources, power and wealth with which he could carry out, 
throughout the whole of India and abroad, a vigorous propa­ 
ganda 'that religious victory was superior to victory on the 
battle-field', itself gained on the strength of the mighty and 
invincible four-fold army built up by Chandragupta and 
Chanakya^' ? Had all that army forsworn arms and lived the 
idle parasitic life of the 'bhikkus' in the 'viharas', embracing 
Buddhism, as soon as Asoka ascended his ancestral throne, 
would it have been possible for him to sit there securely as an 
emperor even for a moment ? Even at that time the Greek 
states beyond the Indian border and farther off than these the 
more ferocious wild tribes of the Saka-Kushan-Hun type, who 
recognized 'violence' as the only means of achieving their 
objectives were anxiously waiting for an opportunity to 
pounce, like a lion, on India, but they feared the four-fold 
invincible Indian army. Would they all not have taken this 
golden opportunity to throttle the 'bhikku-ridden' India and 
Asoka's 'religious triumph without the use of arms' and drawn 
its blood ? 
158. But it is hardly necessary to indulge in these 'ifs' 
and 'whens'. At that very time, India had unfortunately to 
suffer the grievous consequences of the preaching, not only of 
Asoka but of the Buddha himself, as has been shown in my 
play, 'Sanyasta Khadga'". The miserable plight of the people 
and the successful resistance which the Vedic Hindus offered 
will be described hereafter. 
159. While describing these sad consequences, I do not 
at all intend to analyse the comparative merits and demerits 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 67, 
of all religious principles, practices or rituals of both the 
Vedic and the Buddhist religions like the sacrifices, penan­ 
ces, sanyas and the like, from the 'other worldly' point of 
view, nor do I wish to examine them thoroughly and compa­ 
ratively from 'this-worldly' outlook. To see how many of 
those principles are trustworthy today or how many of those 
rituals are worth following at the present time is also out of, 
the scope of this book. So these points will not be raised. 
I, however, wish to discuss in this book the nation-wide con­ 
sequences of the different religious principles and the actions 
of their followers on the political life of India of those days. 
For without any such historical analysis, the different cur­ 
rents and undercurrents of history of those times cannot be 
properly shown. 
AFTER THE DEATH OF ASOKA 
160. This pious emperor, Asoka, who till his end laboured hard according to his own religious faith for the ultimate good of mankind, died in 232 B.C. 
161. His death proved to be the beginning of the end of that magnificent India Maurya Empire ! 
162. During the last 25 years of his life he had applied himself heart and soul to the propagation of the Buddhistic cult. His descendants who succeeded him as emperors were all honest Buddhists and that is why they turned out to be nominal rulers, weak in armed strength^'. Because of the criminal neglect of the imperial military might for these forty years or so by the 'extremists' among the followers of the Buddhist principle of 'non-violence' and their rulers, the whole military organization of the Maurya empire right up to the frontiers, and especially the north-western frontier, gradually went into complete disorder. This was allurement enough for the foreign foes who had been so far kept off through the awe of the Maurya empire, to venture a fresh aggression on India hardly within thirty years or so of Asoka's death". 
68 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY. 
T H E A G G R E S S I O N O F B A C T R I A N G R E E K S 
163. Samrat Chandragupta had defeated Seleucos Nica­ 
tor and driven away the Greeks far beyond the Hindukush 
mountains round about 315 B. C. (cf. paragraphs 130 to 
140). Seleucos had established his independent Greek king­ 
dom in Bactria adjoining the western side of the Hindukush 
mountains which was then the extreme frontier of India. As- 
it was independent, it had lost every contact with the origi­ 
nal distant European Greek state. If at all there existed any 
contact between the two, it was that of dire enmity. These 
Bactrian Greeks, therefore, were called Asian Greeks. Be­ 
cause of the break in the continuity during the intervening 
hundred years or so, these Bactrian Greeks had fallen off 
miserably in every respect from the high standards of the 
original Greeks of Alexander's time. They had now nothing 
of the spirit and vigour of their Alexandrian ancestors. 
Alexandrian ambition of conquering India, however, still 
goaded them on. As soon as they saw the degeneration of 
the military strength of the Maurya empire, these Bactrian 
Greeks were fired with the malicious ambition of Indian con­ 
quest, as has already been told above, and Demetreos, their 
king at that time, crossed the Hindukush and attacked 
India As the Indian army offered no resistance worth the 
name, Demetreos reduced Kamboj, Gandhar and crossed the 
Indus, and conquering the whole of Panchnad, that Yavana- 
dhip (the Greek King) proceeded with his army to conquer 
Magadha i t s e l f T h e whole of the Greek army was inspired 
with the warlike spirit and they began to declare that they 
were going to realize the dream of the Indian conquest of 
Alexander^^. 
WHY THIS SUDDEN DEGENERATION OF 
INDIAN BRAVERY ? 
164. How very strange it is that hardly before a hun­ 
dred years or so the provinces like the Panchnad (the Punjab) 
and others from the Hindukush to the Indus in which the 
brave Indian Kshatriyas, their republics, and soldiers and the 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 69 
common populace had all defeated and repulsed, with excep­ 
tional valour, the aggressive Greeks under Alexander and 
Seleucos and drove them back, should now be overrun so 
very easily by the much too weaker and degenerated Bactrian 
Greeks ! Owing to the constant dread of the brave fighting 
warriors of India, Alexander and Seleucos could not sleep 
soundly in their military camps while fighting in these provin­ 
ces. But these second-rate Bactrian Greek military leaders 
could sleep soundly in the royal palace of Ayodhya (Saketa) 
in the confident safety of their triumph. 
165. This Greek invasion of Demetreos took place within 
thirty to forty years of Asoka's adoption of Buddhism. How 
•did the Indian resisting capacity and bravery in the valiant 
provinces of Gandhar, Panchnad and others deteriorate so 
suddenly during those intervening years? What particular 
•event in those thirty to forty years necessitated this 
•degeneracy in the high standard of Indian heroism? 
166. Was this Bactrian Greek invading army, under the 
leadership of Demetreos, in any way superior to those of 
Alexander and Seleucos? Not at all! They themselves ad­ 
mitted that their forefathers under the leadership of Alexan­ 
der and Seleucos were far superior to them, were endowed 
with almost divine powers*'. It clearly means that the rea­ 
son, why these inferior and weaker Greeks should conquer 
the Indians so very easily, was not that the Greek prowess 
had increased since the time of Alexander but that the 
Indian heroism and the Indian capacity to resist aggression 
must have deteriorated to a horrible extent. 
167. Now, during the hundred and twenty-seven years 
or so that elapsed between the Alexandrian aggression in 327 
B. C. and the one by Demetreos about 200 B. C, there occur­ 
red only one significant event which was likely to bring about 
this grievous falling off in the high standard of Indian mate­ 
rial prowess and their ability to repulse the enemy. It must 
have been the extremist propaganda of the non-resistant 
non-violent principles of Buddhism which condemned the 
military might throughout these provinces. For no other 
70 S!X GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
event of such magnitude took place at that time. We shall just consider here two points which throw some light on this issue. 
INDIAN MENTALITY AT THE TIME OF 
ALEXANDER'S INVASION AND THAT AT THE 
TIME OF DEMETREOS ! 
168. At the time of Alexander the Buddhist cult was 
never heard of in the provinces of Kamboj, Gandhar, Panch­ 
nad straight to Sind. (cf. para: 16). The people there were 
hero worshippers nf Vedic Hindus ! States like the Youdheyas 
were proud of their war-like spirit and bore the attribute 
'Nation-in-arms' (siiq^sftq^) with evident exultation ! (cf : para 
38). Not only the Kshatriyas there, but in some of the states 
all the citizens, men and women, young or old, took the field 
to face the aggressive foreign enemy. Where unfortunately 
a certain republic got beaten, the brave Indian ladies there 
leapt into the fire with the dauntless children (cf. paras 40 to 
55) at their breasts ! One more thing can be adduced in 
support of the martial spirit of the Vedic Indians of the time 
of Chandragupta-Chanakya who were ever prepared to protect 
the national boundaries. 
169. It is interesting to note how martial prowess has 
been extolled in glowing terms in the famous treatise, 'Artha­ 
shastra' of Chanakya, which mainly guided the administra­ 
tion of the magnificent Indian empire of Chandragupta. 
According to Chanakya's treatise, all the varnas including 
the Brahmins had free access to the military service. 
?rq%^t5^ 55^5:5T?^^?cr> ffsrfeT ii 
(in the event of an extensive war with the enemy. 0 Yudhi- sthir, all the classes of people should be seen well-armed with weapons.) 
This was the tradition of the Vedic Hindus ! When such a large imperial army entered the battlefield in order to face the enemy, the emperor, dictates Chanakya, himself was to address the whole four-fold army in the following way : 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 71 
<'t^Kc(CA||^ ^T^ra-^f^nnRTi^: qin^Rg^gr^R ^xm ifir: 
(The brave warriors enjoy the same bliss as the one 
which is obtainable through the final ceremonial bath after 
the completion of sacrifices—it is vouchsafed by the VedasI 
In the righteous war the warriors sacrificing their lives go 
instantly to the same blissful state (in heaven). This king­ 
dom is to be enjoyed by you as well as it is by me. Then, 
why wait. Pall upon the enemy, and annihilate them !) 
171. Who can tell, even Chandragupta himself might 
have thus inspired his Indian fighting forces when they mar­ 
ched upon Seleucos ! 
172. The war, which beats down unjustifiable aggression, 
protects the virtuous people and destroys the wicked ones, is 
never considered 'violent' by the Vedic religion. It is called 
a religious war (a righteous war!)**. 
173. At the time of Alexander the Vedic propagandists had been going round kindling the fire of heroism and bravado in order to fight such a righteous war of liberation against the Yavan (Greek) enemy throughout that region from the Panchnad to Sindh. Many of such national propa­ gandists, mostly Brahmins, were being caught and hanged by Alexander ! (cf : paras 32 and 69 for Plutarch's citation) 
174. After the valiant soldiers of Chandragupta thus routed the forces of the Yavan emperor, Seleucos, Chandra­ gupta and Chanakya built a strong steel wall of the mightiest four-fold army in the world to protect the Indian empire right up to the Hindukush mountain. The dread of that armed might alone stopped the Bactrian Greeks beyond the Hindukush from harbouring any thought of enmity towards India for about 125 years. So long as Samrat Asoka called himself the follower of the Vedic religion, that means till about 252 B.C., the north-western fronrier guards of the Mauryan empire remained well-equipped and invincible. 
175. But as soon as Asoka adopted Buddhism, this security of the empire fell to pieces ! Had Asoka abdicated 
72 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
from the imperial throne of Magadha when he adopted 
Buddhism as Lord Gautam Buddha himself forsook the Sakya 
nation before him, and had he travelled around as a bhikku 
propagating the faith, the Indian empire might have been 
spared a great calamity and Asoka's loyalty to Buddhism, 
too, would have been truly tested. But till his death Asoka 
could not bring himself to abdicate his imperial throne. On 
the contrary he turned his whole empire into a Buddhistic 
monastery to carry on the propaganda. Evidently enough 
in those frontier provinces the dictums like 'Religious victory 
excels martial glory', 'Anger should be conquered by the 
negation of anger', 'Non-violence is the supreme religious 
duty', 'Never kill any animal', and such others which had 
their roots in the Vedic religion, and which were beneficial 
to the society so long as they were practised with due regard 
to place, time and person, began to be preached in the 
Buddhist way, irrespective of any such consideration and in 
absolute terms, without any reservations. Bands of 'bhikkus' 
brought up and maintained by the imperial treasury of 
Asoka began to preach in that region that armed might was 
a sin ! Only the followers of Buddhism were appointed to 
high ofiices of 'Dharmamahamatra' {^^ ^Tm), provincial 
officers, and the faithful government servants like the Rajjuks. 
All these were expected, according to the orders from Asoka, 
to reader every sort of help on government level to the 
precept and practice of the Buddhistic cult. Throughout 
the provinces like Gandhar and Panchnad Buddhism was 
preached not only amongst civilians but also amongst the 
soldiers. Naturally in those frontier provinces of India, the 
warlike spirit and armed strength began to decrease as 
speedily as the untrammelled propaganda about non-violence 
and other Buddhistic principles gained momentum every­ 
where with the avowed royal support. After Carrying on such 
demilitarizing and anti-national propaganda for twenty years, 
Asoka breathed his last. His successors, the Buddhist weak­ 
lings, surpassed Asoka in the neglect of the invincible 
frontier guards which had been so scrupulously and assidu- 2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 73 
ously maintained in well-equipped military outposts since 
the time of Chandragupta. This was ignored to such an 
extent that the whole defence-line collapsed as would a whole 
turret the base of which has sunk underground. 
IN SHORT 
176. Because Asoka and his descendants with their 
imperial support carried throughout their empire the 
incessant propaganda of the one-sided extremist Buddhist 
principles, which derided martial prowess, and criminally 
Jieglected the intrepidity and valour which fought for 
national independence, and because they transformed the 
whole empire into a gigantic Buddhistic monastery and 
converted the fighting warriors into saffron-clad Buddha 
bhikkus, the heroic spirit among the people of the frontier 
provinces and their staunch patriotism suffered a horrible 
•debasement and the military organization which had been 
the strongest in the world since the time of Chandragupta, 
wore out completely because of this internal virus. And 
that is the reason why Demetreos' Greek forces, far inferior 
-to those of Alexander and Seleucos, could so easily reduce 
the whole region from the Hindukush to the Panchnad and 
could march proudly towards Magadha. 
177. With all the imperial authority and resources at 
the disposal of these Buddhists, none of the provincial 
.governors, nor any administrator, nor even the Buddhist 
population, got excited and boldly came forward to fight in 
the battlefield these Yavan foes who dared snatch away the 
independence of India and subjugate it. They were not 
enraged at this insult of India nor were they ashamed of it. 
"The very descendant of Asoka in Magadha, who called him­ 
self emperor and was adoring the imperial throne, the 
Buddhist King Brihadrath, never took a step to resist the 
advance of the Greek enemy ! 
178. Perhaps that Buddhist King was trjdng to win 
•over the Greeks by his unrestrained observance of the Bud­ 
dhistic principle of 'non-resistance' and the one which 
74 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
preached, "Anger should be conquered by the negation of 
anger" and was trying to succeed in the application of the 
Buddhistic doctrine by keeping indoors ! 
WAVE OF NATION-WIDE RAGE AMONG THE 
VEDIC HINDUS : THE VALIANT KHARVELA, 
THE KING OF KALINGA, MARCHES ON 
THE GREEKS 
179. Although the Buddhists were neither enraged nor 
disturbed, nor for that matter, even ashamed of the fact 
that the Greek aggression was undermining the national 
honour of India or that it endangered the nation's liberty, 
the Vedic Hindus at least were highly enraged at this 
national insult and the imminent national calamity. Unfor­ 
tunately, they had no political power left in the north of 
India which could immediately resist this national calamity. 
But within a decade of Asoka's death the provinces of 
Kalinga and Andhra in south India had renounced the para- 
mountcy of the Buddhist Mauryas and established their 
independent kingdoms^'. The kings of both these provinces- 
were staunch followers of the Vedic religion and so equally 
staunch Indian patriots. Both of them had built up mighty 
armies well-equipped with arms. The news that the Greeks 
had conquered northern India, and that the Magadha king, 
a weak Buddhist, could not at all resist it, caused a great 
furore amongst the Vedic population in South India. At last, 
the king of the independent State of Kalinga, the valiant 
Kharvela, decided to march himself at the head of an army 
against the Greek army of Demetreos. 
THE YAVANAS ROUTED : THEIR HASTY 
RETREAT ! 
180. First of all with a mighty army he conquered 
Magadha^s and joined battle with the Greek forces some­ 
where near Ayodhya^^. The strong Indian army of Kalinga 
dealt such a crushing defeat upon the Greeks that Demetreos'"' 
immediately turned his face backwards, and marched off with 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 75 
all his army back to his home beyond the Panchnad'^. 
181. After driving the Greeks beyond the frontiers of 
India, Kharvela did not find much time either to pursue the 
fleeing enemy or to organize the administration of the whole 
of that region. Political emergency drove him back to 
Kalinga almost immediately. He did not dethrone the 
Maurya emperor of Magadha, King Brihadrath. As soon as 
he returned to Kahnga, Kharvela celebrated, according to 
the Vedic tradition, the horse ceremony'*, to commemorate 
the brilliant victory he had gained against the Greeks in de­ 
fence of the honour and liberty of India. This horse-sacrifice 
was particularly known to have a national and political 
significance". Besides owing to Asoka's ban, the Vedic 
Hindus were not able to perform any sacrifice whatsoever for 
the last forty or fifty years. But soon after the Vedic states 
were established in Kalinga and Andhra, this horse-sacrifice, 
the first of its kind was celebrated in total defiance of all the 
injunctions of Asoka on the Vedic religious practices immor­ 
talising the crushing defeat inflicted on the Greeks, the 
national enemies of India. 
ANOTHER GREEK INVASION 
182. Seeing that Kharvela had returned to the south 
Menander, who had so far stabilized his position in Kamboj 
and Gandhar and who was furious at the disaster met with by 
Demetreos on his march against Magadha, once again invaded 
India within a period of four years'*. As at the time of the 
invasion of Demetreos so also at this time the Greeks did not 
meet with any opposition worth the name in the Panchnad, 
which was dominated by the Buddhists and, as such, had 
become pacifist. The weak descendant of Asoka on the 
throne of Magadha, too offered no effective resistance. 
THE BUDDHISTS SYMPATHIZE WITH 
THE GREEKS 
183. On the contrary, Menander could enlist the .sym­ 
pathy of many of the Buddhists in his campaign. For he 
•76 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
openly said that he approved of many of the Buddhist 
principles and that he was soon going to become a convert 
to it^^. So, many Buddhist preachers began to publicise that 
the Greeks had come to fight with the Vedic Hindus alone 
•and that if they conquered India theirs would be a Buddhist 
rule ! The Buddhists were not much concerned with the 
alien nationality of the Greeks. Buddhism did not recognize 
the differences of caste, race or nationality ! This was the 
anti-national and anti-Indian wicked way in which the 
Buddhist preachers began to delude the people of India ! 
As their sympathetic assistance was so useful to Menander, 
he too began to circulate through his Greek agents that this 
•campaign of his was directed solely to nip in the bud the 
conspiracy of the Vedic Hindus to snatch away the imperial 
power from the hands of the weak Buddhist rulers of Maga­ 
dha**. Menander came once again reducing the Panchnad 
and other provinces right up to Ayodhya. In order to avoid 
the repetition of the sad plight of Demetreos who had made 
undue haste at an inopportune time, Menander spent some 
time in Ayodhya consolidating the newly won territories and 
replenishing his army before he launched an attack on 
Magadha and waited for the auspicious moment. 
BUT THERE IN PATALIPUTRA...? 
184. The Vedic community and their leaders in North 
•India had already experienced a surge of heroic spirit 
because of the victory of the brave Kharvela of Kalinga. 
To add to it the news arrived of Menander's manacing inva­ 
sion ! Besides, the Indian Buddhist populace showed clear 
signs of defection and betrayal of their co-nationalists to 
Menander. The nationalist Indian leaders, therefore, formed 
a revolutionary body with a view to dethrone the vacillating 
and weak Brihadrath Maurya from the royal seat of Magadha 
and replace him with one of the Vedic sect, who was of proven 
metal like Chandragupta Maurya. But everybody was con­ 
fronted with the difScult question as to who was there so bold 
and powerful as to take the lead in this national revolution 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 77 
and to destroy the Yavanas (the Greeks) completely. 
PUSHYAMITRA 
185. Amongst the remnants of the Magadhan warriors 
in the army of the above-named Brihadrath Maurya was one, 
named Pushyamitra. Hew as a Brahmin by birth. He was,: 
moreover, a staunch supporter of the Vedic religion and 
Indian nationality, and a devotee of Lord Shiv''. His family 
name was Shung. Even in the Magadhan army he had 
attained so much importance because of his military exploits, 
that Brihadrath Maurya himself had appointed him, not 
very willingly but only out of necessity, to the office of the 
Commander-in-Chief of the forces in the face of the deadly 
war with the invading Greeks. The moment he got the reins 
of the highest military authority, Pushyamitra began to 
enlarge and reorganize the army of Magadha, and equipped 
it with all the weapons. This focussed the attention of all 
the patriotic Vedic populace on Pushyamitra, the general 
of the army. Everybody anxiously hoped, if General Pushya­ 
mitra should lead the political coup ? Who else, they 
thought, was, at that time, fitter and abler than this valiant 
hero to ascend the traditional imperial throne of the Indian 
empire ? 
186. From the historically established facts of this 
Magadhan political revolution which are going to be related 
very shortly, it will be amply clear that General Pushyamitra 
must have accepted the leadership of the future conspiracy. 
It is very likely that he must have secured, in advance, at 
least tacit consent of his army and some of its leaders, before 
he acted openlj'. 
ASSASSINATION OF BRIHADRATH MAURYA 
187. While all these preparations were going on, one 
day it was decided to hold a grand military review in the 
vast courtyard of the royal palace in the capital city of 
Pataliputra. Emperor^Brihadrath Maurya was present there 
to witness the march-past and receive the salute of the army. 
78 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
But while as per Pushyamitra's orders the ceremonial move­ 
ments of the four-fold army and their different formations 
were going on with all pomp and show and noise and bustle, 
for some reason, not known to history, some trouble arose 
near the place where King Brihadrath was sitting. In the 
excitement of the moment. General Pushyamitra marched on 
Brihadrath Maurya who had come to be merely the titular 
head of the empire and beheaded him^^. 
188. This chopping off of the head of Brihadrath put a 
stop to the dynasty of the Mauryas ! The Buddhistic Mauryan 
Empire met its doom that day ! 
189. This unexpected and horrible turn of events 
caused a great furore in the large crowd assembled there. But 
did any of the armed warriors or anyone from those of the 
royal household who were sitting near King Brihadrath 
attack General Pushyamitra ? No, not at all. On the con­ 
trary, the whole army hailed him as their leader'®. 
190. For, General Pushyamitra had done exactly what the 
soldiers themselves and many others wanted to do but could 
not, as nobody in the whole of India dared shoulder the 
responsibility for such an hazardous deed. Pushyamitra 
had simply done the unavoidable national duty of killing 
Asoka's descendant, Brihadrath Maurya, who had proved 
himself thoroughly incompetent to defend the independence 
of the Indian empire*". 
PUSHYAMITRA AND CHANDRAGUPTA 
191. Chandragupta and Chanakya had to assassinate, 
as an unavoidable national duty, Samrat Mahapadma Nanda 
who had proved himself thoroughly incapable of repulsing the 
Greeks for the protection of the Indian empire and its inde­ 
pendence at the time of the first Greek invasion of Alexander. 
Just for the same reason Pushyamitra had to cut off the 
head of Brihadrath Maurya, the nominal Buddhist emperor, 
simply as a national duty. 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 79 
EMPEROR PUSHYAMITRA SHUNG 
192. This momentous event took place round about 
184 B. C." and with all the Vedic rituals Pushyamitra was 
annointed Emperor of India on the throne of Asoka in Pata­ 
liputra. It marked the end of the Maurya dynasty and the 
beginning of the reign of the Shungas. 
EMPEROR PUSHYAMITRA'S CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE GREEKS ! 
193. First of all, Pushyamitra stabilized the adminis­ 
trative set-up and consolidated his position in his capital 
and the regions around it and after mobilizing a strong four­ 
fold army, eager to fight, he fell upon Menander who had so 
far dug in his feet safe in Ayodhya**. Finding it extremely 
difficult to hold their ground before the mighty arms of the 
Indian army, the Greek general, Menander began to retreat. 
Earlier Demetreos had not been pursued; but this time 
Pushyamitra was not going to be slack. He chased and 
hunted down the Greek army. Inflicting defeat after defeat 
on the Greek army and causing confusion in their ranks, 
Pushyamitra drove the dispirited and vanquished Menander 
far beyond the Indus. The Indian empire right up to the 
Indus was once again set free from the Greek political 
dominance*'. 
THE GREEK SWORD WAS BROKEN, THE GREEK 
SHIELD SHATTERED, THE VERY ROOT OF 
THEIR POLITICAL POWER DUG UP 
AND DESTROYED ! 
194. This was the last of the Greek aggressions on 
India. This terrible defeat inflicted on the Greeks by Pushya­ 
mitra consumed their strength so much that they never had 
the heart to strike again at Bharat any time in future ! 
Bharat thus annihilated this Greek enemy who had been a 
source of constant trouble since the time of Alexander. 
195. Pushyamitra annexed all the territory liberated 
from the Greek hands to his own empire**. He appointed at 
80 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Ujjaiii his son, Agnimitra, as the viceroy of the region. General Agnimitra was a brave and able commander like his father. He forced the land up to Vidarbha in the South to acknow­ ledge his overlordship. But later Vidarbha refused to do so. Hence Agnimitra attacked it. In the battle Vidarbhadhish (the lord of Vidarbha) was defeated**. Amidst all this con­ fusion. Princess Malavika, the daughter of the Vidarbharaj, was enamoured of the bravery and other virtues of Agnimitra and was very eager to marry him. So with the consent of Pushyamitra, the King of Vidarbha celebrated her marriage with Agnimitra. This not only created the bonds of friend­ ship but also the bonds of blood-relation between the two royal families. On this romantic theme itself has Kalidas composed his famous play Malavikagnimitra. 
A HORSE-SACRIFICE IN THE VERY PATALIPUTRA 
OF ASOKA! 
196. Pushyamitra, who had completely destroyed the Greeks, the age-old alien enemies of the nation, and rejuve­ nated the Indian empire, had acquired with his own splendid victories the right to perform a horse-sacrifice according to the Vedic tradition. About this right of Samrat Pushya­ mitra Vincent Smith writes in his Early History of India (1924), "The Yavanas and all other rivals having been disposed of in due course, Pushyamitra. was justified in his claim to reign as the paramount power of north India and straightaway proceeded to announce his success by a magnificent celebration of the Ashvamedha Sacrifice at his capital. (P.212)*6. 
197. This declaration of celebrating a horse-sacrifice by Samrat Pushyamitra tlirilled the whole country, barring the minority community of the Buddhists, with national pride and martial triumph. In the very capital of Asoka, who had deprived the Vedic Hindus of their religious free­ dom by means of his supreme political authority, was this Ashvamedha of Samrat Pushyamitra to be performed. This horse-sacrifice of Pushyamitra was in fact a public imperial proclamation of Samrat Pushyamitra that all the restrictions 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 81 
imposed by Asoka on the religious freedom of the Vedic 
Hindus were withdrawn. 
198. Emperor Pushyamitra's grandson, Vasumitra, was 
also a spirited young prince, as his father, Pushyamitra's son, 
Agnimitra was a veteran army-leader and an efficient royal 
administrator. When Samrat Pushyamitra let his sacrificial 
horse loose on its triumphal march throughout the land, the 
task of protecting that horse with a strong army was entrus­ 
ted to this brave young grandson. General Vasumitra. The 
horse was not obstructed in his free ramble right up to the 
banks of the Indus. But on the banks of the Indus he was 
opposed by a certain Yavan King which, according to the 
conventions of the time, meant that the sovereignty of 
Pushyamitra was challenged. So the young General Vasu­ 
mitra fought with the 'Yavan' enemy and after defeating him 
completely, got released the ceremonial horse. The bound­ 
less joy that was universally felt in the capital, when after a 
year the invincible and unconquered General Vasumitra 
triumphantly marched into the city, can very well be seen in the 
formal invitation sent by Pushyamitra to his son, Agnimitra, 
which is still available to us in almost the very same words 
of the Emperor*®". Kalidas has practically reproduced it 
verbatim et litteratim in his aforesaid play,'Malavikagnimitra'. 
That letter in the drama is so interesting that everybody 
might read it with pleasure. It is a living document of the 
thoughts of Samrat Pushyamitra and the common feelings of 
the people of those triumphant days. 
A NATIONAL FESTIVAL 
199. The festive occasion of the horse-ceremony was 
graced with the presence of the great sages and ascetics of 
India, Brahmins well-versed i n a l l the Vedic lore, the high­ 
born Kshatriya Kings and princes, the prominent officers 
and administrators of the empire, eminent citizens and 
leaders in towns. Patanjali who was renowned as the greatest 
of the scholars and who has now cotne to be listed, with 
universal approval, among the world's greatest scholars— 
82 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
including the western ones—was also present on that glorious 
occasion. With the blessings and participation of such 
celebrities the festival of that horse-sacrifice naturally came 
to acquire the dignity and grandeur of the Indian national 
victory over the Mlenchchas. 
TOTALLY ANNIHILATED ASIAN GREEK STOCK 
200. After the Greeks were driven away beyond the 
Indus by Samrat Pushyamitra round about 190 to 180 B. C. 
and India was rid of all Greek dominance, the Greek race 
saw the beginning of their extinction. Beyond the Indus in 
•Gandhar and Bactria (Balhik) they had some small states 
dragging on their uncertain existence. And about the beginning 
•of the first century of the Christian era, when a great tide of 
the fierce war-like race of the Sakas from Central Asia dashed 
against Bactria, Persia and Gandhar, the Greeks knew not 
wrhere to flee in order to escape the terrible impact of Sakas' 
sharp swords. They fled with wives and children, the old 
and the infant. At last they crossed the Indus and entered 
India to save their lives*'. But now they came as displaced 
persons seeking shelter ! What a tragic irony ! This influx 
of theirs was a far cry from the triumphant entry of their 
fore-fathers under Alexander and Seleucos! The latter rushed 
in crying hoarse for war, while the present Greeks came in 
begging for shelter !! 
201. But India gave them shelter very graciously in 
those most unfortunate days, forgetting all enmity*^. These 
runaway Greeks settled severally wherever and whenever 
their separate batches could find any shelter. Some of them 
became converts to Buddhism while some courted Hinduism. 
But as Vedic Hindus alone had their states everywhere in 
India, these Greeks, whether they were Buddhists or Vedic 
Hindus, were not able to cause any sort of political trouble. 
They adopted the Indian languages, Indian customs and 
swiftly they were merged completely in the Indian society. 
And because they had marital and other social relations with 
the Indians, within a century or two they completely lost the 2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 83 
sense of their separate existence as Greeks—the sense of their 
separate nationality ! Just as a lump of salt dissolves swiftly 
into the torrential current of the Ganges, in the same way 
their Greek extraction was totally merged into the tidal wave 
of Indian life. 
THE MLENCHCHAS MERGED INTO OUR 
CIVILIZATION 
202. Most of the western historians, and our own 
too,. have completely missed one point in this connection 
which for that very reason must be made explicit here. It is 
this. Whether it was the Greeks or other foreign aggressors, 
—whoever came flashing their swords but who were ultimately 
conquered and engulfed, completely submerged in our society 
leaving not a trace of their separate existence behind. In 
overy case it has been amply proved that it was only when 
the aggressor's insolent sword was beaten down—it was only 
when the aggressor was vanquished completely in the deadly 
armed conflict on the battlefield—that those foreigners became 
so very tame and pliable as to be easily overwhelmed and 
•dissolved in our society. This was achieved not by peaceful 
persuasion, but by the stronger and deadlier weapons. 
NO RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION-BUT THE MOST 
APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT FOR TREASON ! 
203. Some of the old Buddhist books, in the loquacious 
style of the Puranas, enlarge upon the cruel treatment meted 
out by Pushyamitra to Buddhist bhikkus, upon the outright 
massacre of some of them, and the destruction of some of the 
Buddhist monasteries". Even the European historians*" 
have set aside all these references as exaggerated ones! Still 
some of them have stated that there should be some grain of 
truth at the root of these exaggerated accounts that Pushya­ 
mitra might have been guilty of some slight persecution of 
the Buddhists by M'ay of revenge. We also feel that Samrat 
Pushyamitra might have taken good many of the Buddhists 
to task, but not for any philosophical or theological difference 
84 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORV 
of opinion. 
204. The Buddhists were not persecuted as a class simply 
because they believed in nihilism or agnosticism or because 
some of them were atneists while others were non-violent on 
principle and condemned the Vedas, or because their reli­ 
gious rituals were in many ways different from those of the 
Vedic Hindus. Lord Buddha himself experienced no obstacle 
in the propagation of his faith ! Let that alone ! The 
Buddhist faith had been more or less three hundred years old 
by the time of Chandragupta's succession to the throne ! In 
his undivided all-India Hindu empire and also during the 
tenure of the ministerial office of the staunch Arya Chanakya, 
no Buddhist persecution of any sort was reported by the 
Greek ambassador, Megasthenes, who bad stayed at the court 
of the first Maurya Emperor for years together. Megasthenes 
does not refer to Buddhism even by name, for they had 
not till then formed any anti-national and political alliances 
detrimental to the interests of the nation either with A l e x ­ 
ander or Seleucos. It was not then possible for them! That is 
why alone with many other religionists the Buddhists also 
could observe their own rituals according to their own beliefs 
and likings. Besides, they could openly preach by sweet per­ 
suasion and discussion. 
205. Subsequent to the invasions of Alexander and 
Seleucos, when the Greeks came raiding for the second time 
under Demetreos and Menander and when advancing as far as 
Ayodhya they were about to dethrone the reigning king of 
Magadha and endanger the independence of the Indian empire. 
At that time the Indian Buddhists played a brazen-faced- 
treacherous role, as is seen from the fact that these Buddhists: 
swore their loyalty to the Greek Emperor, Menander, whom 
they called Milind. When the latter adopted the Buddhist 
cult, they accepted him as the King of the region conquered 
by him^i. The Buddhist scholars and 'bhikkus' proudly 
struttd in the Indian courts of those Greeks, as if they were 
moving in some national court. In order to put down as 
sternly as possible these highly objectionable treacherous acts 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 85 
of these Indian Buddhists, the plots hatched to undermine 
the national independence, and the open instigation to do 
anti-national acts which went on incessantly through various 
Buddhist monasteries and viharas, Pushyamitra and his gene­ 
rals were forced, by the exigency of the time, when the war 
was actually going on, to hang the IndianBuddhists who were 
guilty of seditious acts and to pull down the monasteries 
which had become the centres of sedition. It was a just 
punishment for high treason and for joining hands with the 
enemy, in order that Indian independence and empire might 
be protected. It was no religious persecution. As the 
supreme authority in the imperial administrative structure of 
India, it was Pushyamitra's duty—a religious and kingly 
duty according national legal code—to chastise perfidy, 
whether it was on the part of the Buddhists or on that of the 
Vedic Hindus ! ASOKA AND PUSHYAMITRA 
206. In traditional historical writings, mainly based on 
Buddhist myths, Asoka has been extolled as tolerant of diff­ 
erent religious sects while Pushyamitra wholly conniving at 
his efforts to establish religious freedom, is generally imputed 
with intolerence and persecution of the Buddhist.s. This false 
notion has to be corrected. If anybody is at all guilty of reli­ 
gious intolerence, it was Asoka himself. For, not only with 
verbal propaganda but with the abuse of his regal authority 
he declared as illegal all the fundamental religious rituals, 
such as sacrifice and hunting by the Vedic Hindus who formed 
the majority of his subjects. But Pushyamitra did not 
issue any royal decree enforcing any performances of sacrifices 
in the Buddha Viharas or the worship of Vaishvadeva in every 
Buddh household, even as a fitting retort to Asoka's injun­ 
ctions. The Buddhists were as absolutely free as all other 
religious sects to perform their religious rites and enjoy 
religious freedom, so long as they abstained from any anti- 
national foreign contact. It is likely that in the troubled times 
of national war the chastisement of the disloyal Buddhists 
86 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
might have affected some of the innocent ones. But it was> 
not a rule—but an inevitable exception ! 
207. What Pushyamitra really did was to reinstate the 
religious freedom which was annulled by Asoka. If anybody 
is to be called intolerent of religious differences, it should be 
Asoka and not Pushyamitra ! 
208. In this context, the words of Vincent Smith who 
shows no particular partiality for the Vedic Hindus and yet 
writes judiciously are worth remembering. 
209. However, Vincent Smith, too, like other historians^ 
has not realized that the taain reason of the general animosity 
that the Vedic Hindus felt toM'ards the Buddhists, and the 
persecutions that the latter suffered at their hands from time 
to time, culminating in the total annihilation of Buddhism 
in India, is that the Buddhists often times betrayed the 
cause of Indian independence and Indian empire. In spite of 
the fact that Vincent Smith never realized this main reason 
of the downfall of Buddhism, he has held the Buddhists 
responsible for the religious persecution mentioned in various 
Buddhist writings. A n extract from his Early History of 
India (1924) (P 213-14) will bear out the above remarks : 
209-A. "The memorable Horse Sacrifice of Pushyamitra 
marked the beginning of Brahmanioal (Vedic ?) reaction 
which was fully developed by centuries later in the time of 
of Samudragupta and his successors...if credit may be given 
to semi-mythological stories of Buddhist writers, Pushya­ 
mitra was not content with the peaceful revival of Hindu 
rites, but indulged in a savage persecution of Buddhism...it 
will be rash to reject this tale as wholly baseless, although it 
may be exaggerated...That such outbursts after all should 
have occurred is not wonderful if you consider the extreme 
oppressivenses of the Jain and Buddhist prohibition when 
ruthlessly enforced as they certainly were by some Rajas and 
probably by Asoka. The wonder rather is that the persecutions, 
were so rare. And that as a rule the various sects managed 
to live together in harmony and in the enjoyment of fairly 
impartial official favour." 
2ND GLORIOUS EPOCH 87 
210. Pushyamitra who, with his armed might, completely 
exterminated the Greek intrusion which from the time of 
Alexander had often caused great harm to India, and who, 
therefore, rightly deserves the title, 'Yavan-destroyer,' 
protected ably for 36 years not only the independence of 
India which he himself had won, but brought about the many 
sided development of his country and then died peacefully in 
149 B.C. 
211. In the sense in which Chandragupta's rout of the

CHAPTER III 
VIKRAMADITYA, THE ANNIHILATER OF SAKA-KUSHAN MENACE 
212. After the total destruction of the Greeks, India saw another foreign aggression which has to be reckoned with in the Indian history rather conspicuously and which was in some respects more ominous and extensive than those of the armies of Alexander or other Greek generals. I mean the incursions of the Sakas and Kushans. 
213. Although the Sakas and the Kushans in some respects differed very widely and although they fought each other very furiously, from the Indian point of view they had such a striking similarity that they appeared almost identical^. Hence their hordes, which dashed against India, like tidal waves, one after another, were generally called Sakas by the common Indian people. At some places in the Indian literature they are referred to as 'Kushs'^. For this very reason, in this book too both of them are mention­ ed as Sakas. 
214. The Sakas lived in Central Asia beyond Bactria (Balhik) in large wild gangs*. The region beyond them was occupied by tribes, equally wild and ferocious*. Even beyond this region right in China, there were still wilder. 
3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH 89 
more ferocious, but braver nomadic tribes of the millions of 
Huns (HsiungNu) which were always at war with one another*. 
These Sakas, Kushans and the Huns entertained bitter 
enmity towards one another and were constantly at war. 
215. About a hundred and fifty years before Christ, 
tribal feuds amongst these nomadic tribes flared up in such 
"terrible manner as were never heard of before. One of these 
tribes, the Huns or Hsiung Nus of China who were the most 
pertinacious desperados of all, fell with all their ferocity and 
might upon the neighbouring tribe of the Kushans, driving 
them off completely out of their homeland towards the 
"west®. So the Kushans in their turn fell in repeated violent 
"tidal waves upon their next neighbours, the Sakas, who were 
then happily ensconced to the north of Bactria (Balhik) ; 
•and after exterminating the latter from their abode they 
founded there their own kingdom, instead. The Sakas 
faithfully forwarded that kick to the adjoining Bactrians 
•whom they attacked instantly. In Bactria (Balhik) were at 
this time, small Greek states, maintaining their precarious 
•existence since the time of Alexander. But against the 
irepeated attacks of these wild tribes in which the women too, 
on horse back, fought shoulder to shoulder with men, these 
Bactrian Greeks were absolutely unable to hold on any longer 
and were, therefore, completely destroyed', their land 
•being overrun and occupied entirely by the Sakas. But 
•even there, and within a short span of a hundred years or 
so, came in hot pursuit their inveterate enemies, the Kushans, 
whose lives were spent, as those of the Sakas, more on cam­ 
paigning on horses and in fully armed military camps than 
;in stabilized and prosperous cities. The Huns again attacked 
the Saka-Kushans and ousting them even from Bactria and 
•other countries, established their own rule there. These 
exterminated Saka-Kushans, being blocked from behind and 
from the sides, had to descend into the region of Baluchis­ 
tan', and along the route through the BolanPass they dashed 
-avalanche-like on the Indian territories of Sindh, Kathiawad 
90 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
and Gujarat. They trampled under their horses' hoofs adjoining Indian territory rushing violently, plundering and burning towns and cities, sparing neither women nor children. History, unfortunately, does not know for certain what Indian states existed there at that time, or whether or not, they could arrest this irrepressible aggression of these Mlenchchas. However it is not necessary to discuss the problem here as it does not fall within the scope of this book which has been outlined in Paragraph 7. It is enough to state here that round about the beginning of the Christian era these Sakas had occupied the Indian territory of Baluchistan, Sindh, Kathiawad, Gujarat and some parts of Aparantak (Konkan) to the south, right upto Ujjayini*. And the whole of India was extremely uneasy at the gruesome prospect of the possible incursions of the Kushans and Huns who were to follow the Sakas ! 
SOUTH INDIA WAS ABSOLUTELY FREE FROM 
THE MLENCHCHA-AGGRESSION 
216. Foreign aggressions , at least in the ancient period of our history, being launched through the north-western frontiers, it was mostly our north Indian brethren who had to bear the whole brunt, opposing them as best as they could and in the long arduous run destroyed them completely. That is why during this period no foreign enemy could crosa the Vindhyas and penetrate into the Southern half of India. Barring the one solitary, transient and half-hearted Arab- invasion^", Southern India continued to enjoy unhampered complete liberty, sovereign imperial authority, and material prosperity; for almost since 500 B.C. no foreign aggressor was- able to cross the Vindhyas and step into the South. Right from Kalinga to the Pandyas, the Cheras, the Cholas and other South-Indian rulers of the time had always kept in readiness strong naval forces, fleets and flotillas to protect the- Western, Eastern and Southern seas against all foreign incur­ sions. Naturally, the Indian sea-fronts remained absolutely:^ inviolable throughout all this period. On the contrary the

strong South-Indian naval powers had carried their invincible- 
and conquering armadas to Burma, Siam and other countries 
right upto the Philippines and established their over-sea 
political, cultural and commercial empire^^. 
217. As the foreign aggressions through the north-west 
frontier were successfully opposed there and then by our 
north-Indian heroes, those various enemies could not even 
reach the Narmada river. But the Sakas having entered 
India through the Bolan Pass in Baluchistan, in the coastal 
provinces of Sindh, Kathiawad and Gujarat, were compara­ 
tively exposed to their own attacks and this was the foreign 
aggression on South India. But that too proved abortive.. 
Why ?

218. Fortunately, at this very time were rising ta 
prominence the two States of Kalinga and Andhra who were 
staunch followers of the Vedic religion and were nationalist, 
in their outlook. Like all other nationalist Indians the- 
Andhras were beside themselves with mortification and indig­ 
nation at the foreign Saka attack on the vast Indian region, 
from Sindh to Ujjain and at the sad and humiliating fact 
that there should be no Indian power to resist it. Moreover, 
since some of the Saka hordes had reached as far as Aparan- 
tak (Konkan) after having crossed the Narmada river, the 
safety of the Andhra kingdom itself was seriously endangered.. 
For these various reasons the rulers of Andhra marched with 
a mighty army against the Sakas with a view to annihilate 
t h e m c o m p l e t e l y , a n d f o r t h e first t i m e t h e y c h a l l e n g e d 
the Sakas' might driving them back beyond the Narmada 
river^^. Simultaneously with this impact of the Andhras, 
the Sakas who had till then spread upto Ujjain in the- 
north, suffered another defeat at the hands of the Youdheyas. 
and Malavas'^*. It has already been described (in paragraphs 
.38 to 40 and 50 to 62) with what invincible valour these two- 
republics had offered sanguinary battles in the defence of 
Indian liberty even at the time of Alexander's invasion. So- 92 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
being attacked by the Andhras from the South and in the 
north by the Youdheya-Malavas, the very sting of the 
a.ggressive fang of the Sakas was completely blunted and 
devenomed. Their progress stopped forever. They were 
never able to establish a unitary and powerful rule of all the 
Sakas anywhere in India. Whatever stray kingdoms they 
had founded so far in India, were unable to face successfully 
the two-pronged drive of the Indian retaliation. 
THE VICTORIOUS MALAVAS 
219. The above-mentioned Youdheyas and the Malavas 
attacked the Sakas who had spread round about Ujjayini. 
An allusion has been found to have been made to the fact that 
the Malavas had invested the fort of 'Uttambhadra' round 
•about the year 57 B.C. The then celebrated King of Sakas, 
named Nahapan, had forced the Malavas to lift the siege. 
But soon after the Malava forces encircled Nahapan with 
bis whole army from all quarters. Naturally a decisive battle 
was joined, wherein the Malava republican army showed the 
limit of its valour, but not being content with the destruction 
•of the Saka forces which were considered to be second-rate 
they killed in the war their very King Nahapan". 
MALAVA SAMVAT 
220. Because of this crushing defeat at the hands of 
the Malavas, the Saka military might and morale was so 
much shaken that they seemed to have taken a fright of their 
lives to face pitched battles with the Indian armies. This 
battle is conspicuous in another respect too, in as much as 
the Malavas started a new era of their own in the year of this 
victory to commemorate their signal success over the Sakas 
which had resounded throughout the length and breadth of 
India. They named this era as 'Krt', but on the coins that 
they struck on this occasion are inscribed in the Brahmi 
script legends such as 'Malavajayah', 'Malavanam Jayah', 
"Malava Ganasya' and so on^^.

T H I S IS T H E S A M E V I K R A M S A M V A T O F O U R S 
221. In our country, good many emperors started new- 
eras in their own names. It was a traditional ambition, and 
a kind of right of such victorious kings and emperors to style 
themselves as 'Shakakartas' (the starters of new eras). The 
latest instance that can be cited is that of Shri ShivajiMaharaj. 
He too commenced his own era the 'Shive-Saka'. Most of these 
various eras ended with the termination of these royal dynas­ 
ties. However, of the two or three eras, which have attained 
a national character and which have been adopted by the 
Hindu world, although region-wise, and by which not only 
our mundane affairs but our religious rites also are dated 
for more or less two thousand years, the Malava-Samvat 
should be remembered rather particularly because this very 
Malava-Samvat later on became our famous Vikram Samvat. 
222. The celebrated historian. Dr. Jayaswal, inhis 'Hindu 
Polity', has ably upheld the view that Malava-Samvat is the 
same era as our Vikram Samvat. However, he maintains that 
Malava-Samvat was also called Vikram Samvat (era 
celebrating a victory) from the very beginning. But from the 
historical incidents that we are going to cite here, it should be 
clear that another view of the matter is more acceptable. 
This second view claims that it was to celebrate the all-India 
character of the Gupta Emperor, Vikramaditya's victory over 
the Saka-Kushans which wiped out their separate existence 
from the Indian soil, when the victorious king began to rule 
from Ujjayaini. That Vikram Samvat became, as years 
elapsed, more and more widely known throughout the nation 
and equally popular, so that throughout the whole of north 
India millions of Hindus are even now observing it in their 
religious rites and ceremonies. 
ORIGIN OF VIKRAM SAMVAT AND SHALIVAHAN SAKA. 
223. It must be made clear here and now that there is 
yet no agreement reached amongst the historians about the 
origin of this Vikram Samvat^^. There are very wide differ- 
^94 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
ences of opinion about the chronology of various important 
events in our ancient history. So are they on this point too ! 
JJven in respect of the birth of Gautam Buddha the dates 
suggested by different historians vary at times by fifty or even 
a hundred years. The same can be said of Kanishka's times. 
Some maintain that he ascended the throne in 78 A.D., while 
-others put up the date of his accession to the throne as 120 
A . D. Even about this Vikram-Samvat a third opinion is 
still sponsored by some historians that the Vikram Samvat 
had nothing to do with the era started by the Malava Repub­ 
lic; that it was the one started in 58 B. C. by Azes I, one of 
the Chief Kshatraps (Satrap) of the Sakas who had by then 
-entered India, and the one which later on people renamed as 
Vikram Samvat when the Gupta Emperor, Vikramaditya 
completely uprooted the power of the Saka-Kushans. There is 
also the fourth one that in 58 B.C. a certain valiant emperor, 
named Vikramaditya, who ruled there at the time, won 
a great victory over the Sakas and started this era in his 
own name to commemorate that victory of his. It had again 
nothing whatever to do with the Malava-era or that started 
by Saka Satrap, Azes I. But as no rock inscription or any 
other evidence is found which refers to the Vikramaditya who 
ruled at that time or again as no coins of the Vikram Samvat 
-have yet been found this myth about the aforesaid era has 
not so far attained the veracity of a historical event. 
224. If, however, any coins or rock-inscriptions or other 
evidence were to come forth any time and if anybody were to 
propound a new theory about the origin of this Vikram 
Samvat, we shall be glad to accept it. 
225. What is said about the Vikram Samvat can very 
well be said about the Shalivahan (Salivahan) Saka. The 
advocates of the first opinion about this era say that when 
the first King of the Kushans in India, Wima Kadphises 
[Wemo (Ooemo) in his Greek coin legends and Yenkao-ching 
of the Chinese historians—of Smith OHI P. 147] whom our 
people considered no other than a Saka, ascended the throne 
(of his father) in 78 A. D., it was he who started this 'Saka' 
3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH 95 
era. But another class of historians hold that it was not Wima Kadphises who ascended the throne in 78 A. D., but it was his successor Kanishka who did that, and that it was that Emperor Kanishka who started the Saka era in order to perpetuate the memory of his accession to the throne. Later on when the Salihavan emperors of Paithan conquered the Sakas they turned the Saka era into the Salivahan Saka to signalize their victory. Besides these two, there is a third opinion held by some historians that the Salivahan Saka is in no way connected with that of Kanishka or any other Kushan King. They maintain that round about the year 78 A.D. King Hal, who wrote the Gatha Saptasati, himself won a glorious victory over a Saka Satrap in Gujarath or Sourash- 
•tra and to perpetuate this monumental success over these Sakas he started the Salivahan Saka. 
226-229. Since there is no need to discuss this topic here at any great length, it will be quite enough to mention two or three important points from whatever little is written here about the Saka era. They are :— 
(a) Whatever opinion about the Saka and Vikram eras is accepted it is agreed beyond doubt that both the eras signify the decisive victories the Indians won over the Saka- Kushans. 
(b) In our count of time Samvat is a more acceptable term than Saka—We have all along been using right from the Vedic times Samvatsar and Samvat for the measurement of time. The word 'Saka' has not been generally used in that sense. It is quite clear, therefore, that the word must be a corruption of the name of foreign aggressors like the Sakas and the Kushans. 'Shalivahan (Salivahan) Saka' is not a pure name of Sanskrit extraction as Vikram Samvat. So the name 'Saka' of our Mlenchcha enemies should be eliminated and only 'Salivahan Samvat' should be used at the time of the celebration of our religious rites and the words 'Shalivahan Saka' or merely 'Saka' as wrongly used in our religious ceremonies should be banned. 
(c) That both the national eras, namely the Vikram 
96 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Samvat and the Salivahan Samvat, should be closely- 
connected with the glorious memory of Indian victories over 
the Saka-Kushans is not merely a queer coincidence, it is 
of great significance. Many eras like those of the imperial 
Guptas and others, although greatly honoured during those 
particular periods, are lost in the abyss of time. Only these 
two which recorded the Indian victories over the Saka- 
Kushans have enjoyed immortality. This may give us a fair 
idea as to how our Indian Vedic people had to suffer 
grievously at the hands of the ungovernable hordes of the 
Saka-Kushans. For, otherwise these Vikram and Salivahan 
Samvats which were started to perpetuate the memory of the 
victories of the Salivahan and Gupta emperors over the 
diabolic atrocities of, and political subjection by, the Saka- 
Kushans would never have attained so much importance 
vis-a-vis the extinction of many other victorious eras, and 
could never have been observed even after the lapse of two 
thousand years as the chief national eras of the Hindus. 
INDIANS' MARTIAL & RELIGIOUS VICTORY OVER 
THE SAKAS 
230. Just as the Malavas firmly checked the aggression 
of Sakas by killing their king, Nahapan (cf: Para 219), in a 
similar way and at the same time did our Andhra warriors 
march from the south towards the north and destroy the 
Saka kingdoms in Gujarath, Sourashtra, and Sindh". 
Harassed by the repeated offensives opened against them 
by the valiant Salivahan Kings like Vilinayankur, Gautami- 
putra Satkarni, Vashishthiputra Pulamayi and others, the 
Saka Kings upto Ujjain ultimately reconciled themselves to 
the sovereignty of the Salivahan Emperorsi^. There exists 
a rock inscription which tells us tha.t a Saka Satrap 'Rudra' 
even gave his daughter in marriage to a Salivahan King^* 
as the Greek King Seleucos had years before given his to 
Emperor Chandragupta! 
231. It must also be borne in mind that because of 
incessant fighting with the Indians on various battle-fields 
3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH 97 
and the consequent destruction, during this century or a half, 
of thousands of their original number of soldiers that came 
to India, the Saka power suffered great numerical losses. 
232. As the Saka military might thus began to lose 
strength because of the Indian resistance, the highly deve­ 
loped Indian civilization began more and more to effectively 
impress itself on the foreign Sakas. As a natural result of 
the constant warfare with the Indians for over a hundred 
years, the Sakas seemed to have surrendered completely to 
tbe Indian civilization. From the common man to their 
royal families, the Sakas abandoned their own original Saka 
names and adopted purely Indian ones like Satyasinh, 
Rudrasen and others^". It is strange to note, that most of them 
embraced the Vedic religion. In fact, ever since the Sakas 
crossed the Hindukush and entered Baluchistan and Sindh 
and settled there permanently, they had come in constant 
contact with the Buddhist population and the Buddhist 
centres there, preaching and propagating the tenets of Lord 
Buddba from the time of Asoka and Menander. Moreover 
the Malava-Youdheya republics, which fought with them 
furiously at that time and defeated them and also the valiant 
armies of the Satvahanas too were Vedic Hindus. The Buddh­ 
ists had never resisted them with or without arms. Under 
these circumstances, it would have been but natural, had 
the Sakas hated the Vedic religion of their powerful enemies 
and accepted the Buddhist cult of those who ungrudgingly 
submitted to their political domination. But what happend 
was exactly the opposite of this natural expectation. The 
majority of the Sakas, right from the commoner to the royal 
prince, got themselves converted, most willingly, to the Vedic 
religion^i. The raison d'etre perhaps was that the Sakas 
being originally of a warlike disposition, whose blood always 
rushed violently through their veins at the thought of a 
battle, looked with awe and respect the valiant Vedic war­ 
riors who fought and defeated them, enemies though they 
Avere, and the Vedic religion which inspired such fighting 
spirit amongst its votaries must have exerted a great 
98 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
fascination for them. 
233. The Sakas came to love the Sanskrit language too. 
The kings of two or three feudal Saka principalities that 
were left in their hands patronized Sanskrit studies. One of 
the Saka kings made Sanskrit the official language for all 
correspondence of his court and administrative depart­ 
ments^^. Their correspondence with the other Indian States, 
big or small, was also carried on in Sanskrit. Their social 
customs and manners, too underwent rapid changes and they 
got themselves attuned to Indian Social life^'. 
THE KUSHAN INVASIONS 
234. While the Indians were thus gaining victories over 
the Sakas in military, as well as cultural, fields and were 
uprooting their aggression, the locust-like hordes of the 
Kushans dashed against the northern frontier of India towards 
the Hindukush. These Kushans were ousted from their 
homeland by the Huns along with their women and children. 
As such fighting troops of millions of Kushan men and 
women violently entered Southern Asia shedding blood, plun­ 
dering and burning towns and cities and spreading destruc­ 
tion everywhere. Throughout the whole Asiatic region, right 
from the,Chinese frontier beyond the Hindukush to that of 
Greece in the west they literally played havoc. Some of 
their troops in hot pursuit of their old enemies, the Sakas, 
overran the Bactrian Kingdom, and, crossing the Hindukush 
entered the Indian north-western provinces of Gandhar, and 
extirpating the smaller Saka principalities that still were 
there at the time, they pushed themselves ahead into the 
Punjab. They founded there a kingdom of their own. The 
name of their first king in India was Wima Kadphises^*. 
235. The might of the northern Youdheyas, Malavas and 
other republics and that of the Salivahans in the South being 
put to its last extremity of endurance in successfully resisting 
and ultimately putting down tbe Saka aggression for more or 
less a hundred years, they could not immediately and suc- 
cessfuly stem the overwhelming onlaught of the Kushans, 
3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH 99 
who were crueller and more blood-thirsty than even the Sakas, till they came to occupy the Punjab. However, even in those miserable days the Indian resistance to Kushan aggression gradually became so hot and determined that the Kushan hordes could not make any headway in the Indian territories this side of the Punjab. 
EMPEROR KANISHKA 
236. After the death of Wima Kadphises, Kanishka 
ascended the Kushan-throne in 78 A. D. (in the 'opinion of 
some historians in 120 A. D.^^.) ! His achievements were un­ 
rivalled, his ambition was boundless. It is needless to give 
any detailed account in these pages. Some events, however, 
have to be recounted here so far as they fall within the scope 
of this book. Kanishka subdued all the nomadic, plundering 
and marauding bands of the Saka-Kushans on both sides 
of the Himalayas (Hindukush ?) as also all the smaller or 
bigger centres of political power and forged them all into 
an extensive empire^®. He proclaimed himself as the 
Emperor of the Kushans and founded his capital at Purush- 
pur (Peshawar of today). Thereupon he marched on the Sakas 
who had established their power from Malava to Sindh and 
who, being defeated by the Andhras, had acknowledged their 
paramountcy^'. But the same Indian States which had been 
incessantly fighting the Sakas for over a century and had 
been by now thoroughly exhausted in their attempt to put 
down these aggressors, had to face this new calamity of the 
Kushan onslaughts and as such they found it extremely 
difficult to do so. Being defeated in one or two battles, the 
Satavahanas themselves had to withdraw their forces from 
the north of the Narmada river to the south in order to build 
up a strong defence for their own territory against Kanishka's 
conquests. By that time Kanishka had conquerred all the 
Saka states of Malava, Gujarath, Sourashtra and Sindh^*. 
Naturally, the Sakas in those regions renounced their al­ 
legiance to the Andhras and paid the^pbeissance to their new 
lord. Emperor Kanishka^^. Over and above, Kanishka's 
loo SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
army crossed the Narmada in order to march upon the- 
Andhras themselves and subdued a corner of Aparantak 
(north Konkan). But mindful of the concentrated armed 
might of the Andhras, Kanishka dared not attack them. So 
he withheld his southern conquests forthwith. Thereafter he 
marched with a huge army to oppose the Chinese general who 
had invaded his north-Himalayan territories. After a series 
of battles, he vanquished even the Chinese general and 
annexed the Chinese provinces of Kashgar (Tashkand),. 
Chaskand, and Khotan to his empire. 
THE TEST OF A NATION'S PROWESS AND ITS 
RIGHT TO LIVE 
237. The propriety of recounting this whole incident 
here is to show clearly that this sudden eruption of the 
Saka-Kushans throughout Asia did not convulse India alone; 
it discomfited even the then strongly built and well-organised 
empire like China too for a time on the battlefield*". But just 
as it is tom-foolery, born out of jealousy, to say that the 
Chinese nation had been weak throughout all these years and 
was never better fitted for anything else than to be rotting 
in slavery simply because they suffered temporary defeats 
against the Saka-Kushans or at some such other times, it is 
equally foolish and jealously blind to say, as some of our 
enemies do, that the Indian national life was a series of 
defeats. It only shows that they cannot read history 
properly. 
238. It is not the number of foreign aggressions over 
a nation that is the last criterion of deciding its vitality or 
virulity or the absence of both, but the query, whether that 
nation was destroyed as a result of those aggressions or 
whether in the final phase of that national struggle that 
nation was able to overcome those foreign aggressions, that 
determines a nation's prowess, its vitality and its right to 
live. 
239. Let us see which of the three, the Sakas, the 
Kushans or the Indians, passed this test successfully, and 
3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH IGl 
•who passed out of existence. 
KANISHKA EMBRACES BUDDHISM ? 
240. Although busy with his campaigns right upto 
'China and the consequent wars, Kanishka's m i n d was always 
preoccupied with religious and cultural things. He in the 
meanwhile, proclaimed his conversion to Buddhism*^. In 
consonance with this new creed of his he built several stupas 
and vihars at various places, in his empire. At that time 
also, as it was during the Asokan regime. Buddhism was 
burdened with innumerable fads and fanciful theories. The 
different Buddhistic sects were at enmity with one another. 
So in order to do away with all these differences and to 
bring about a general agreement, he, like Asoka, convened 
a great council of all the Buddhist sects*^. But instead of a 
general agreement there appeared a new sect called the 
Mahayan which virtually changed the nature of the Buddhist 
cult**. Since the all-embracing precepts and practices, which 
were agreeable to Kanishka but which had no base in the 
original form of B u d d h i s m , were incorporated i n this new 
Mahayan sect, some others refrained from joining it and 
eventually founded a new sect which came to be called 
Heenayan. Kanishka helped spread the Mahayan sect 
extensively in his trans-Himalayan demense. This great 
council recognised Sanskrit as the language of their religion. 
Hence Buddhistic scriptures, which were formerly written 
in Pali and Prakrit only, were translated into Sanskrit. Many 
new books, such as the Buddha-charit, and others on varied 
subjects were composed by learned scholars who enjoyed the 
patronage of Kanishka**. Naturally, not only i n India but 
even amongst the Saka-Kushan population in the Asian 
empire of Kanishka the old as well the new Sanskrit literature 
and civilization began to spread briskly*^. Thus did th's 
new Kushan world, which had come as a conqueror willingly 
became subservient to this Indian civilization and culture, 
as did tbe Saka-world before it, in respect of Indian religion, 
Indian language, Indian thought and Indian customs. 102 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
241. Since Buddhism itself was an Indian religion, 
India could boast of a religious victory when Emperor 
Kanishlia embraced it. Although this was all well done, it 
must be borne in mind that Buddhism that was embraced by 
Kanishka was not the unadulterated original one of Lord 
Buddha nor that of Asoka. It was the Kanishkan edition 
of Buddhism. Eor example, although the Emperor had 
surrendered his loyalty to Buddhism, he still worshipped the 
Vedic deities like Rudra. Kanishka's Buddhistic faith had 
nothing to do whatever with the non-violence (5iff?n) of Asoka 
which declared 'Abstain from violence to animals' or 'Not the 
victory of the battle-field, but the religious victory is the 
only true victory'*®. While on the one hand he was spreading 
the Mahayan sect, this avowed Buddhist was, on the other 
hand, attacking his enemies with huge armies*^. In order 
that he might be called the Emperor of China he passed ten 
years of his life in bivouacs with armed soldiers all round 
him. In the end tired of his lust for incessant warfare his 
army revolted and killed him. Death alone could put a stop 
to his insatiate lust for war**. 
242. One more thing to be pondered over : How could 
Kanishka spread Buddhism in the Chinese territory beyond 
the Himalayas ? It was possible because he had first 
conquered those provinces with his weapons of war. Spread 
of the Buddhistic cult there followed his martial glories on 
the battle-fields ! That is why it spread there so rapidly. 
He sent hundreds of missionaries there, built various vihars,. 
fed and fostered thousands of Bhikkus ! All this was 
possible for him because he had under his command a very 
powerful empire, i.e., he had a mighty armed strength. 
Wasn't it ? 
243. In fine it will have to be said that the statements 
like, 'Armed victory is superior to religious victory' or vice 
versa are untenable. 
244. Without armed support, religious victory is tame 
and insipid, whereas martial glory without a strong religious, 
footing becomes grossly diabolic ! This alone is true. 
3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH 103 
HEREDITARY DISLOYALTY OF THE 
B U D D H I S T S (Continued) 
245. A Buddhist or a Vedic Hindu, Kanishka was after 
all a foreigner belonging to the Kushan aggressive tribe, and 
had founded an empire on the north-western frontier of India 
by force. His empire was in fact an aggression on India. 
His was not at all an indigenous Indian empire. So the 
patriotic Vedic population of India fought furiously with 
Kanishka as it did with the Sakas, in order to overthrow his 
empire and to liberate all those Indian provinces which had 
the misfortune to grovel under his political domination. But 
what were the Indian Buddhists doing at that time ? They 
tendered their submission to the Mlenchcha enemy, the 
Kushan emperor, as soon as he courted the Buddhistic cult 
and began to perpetrate acts of treachery against the Indian 
nation and the brave patriotic Vedic people, who were 
fighting for her liberty ! As has already been described (in 
paragraphs 204 to 209) the Indian Buddhists had, formerly in 
the time of Emperor Pushyamitra, who fought for national 
liberty, sold their loyalty to the Greeks led by Menander and 
others and committed treason against their native land. In 
the very same manner, they did not hesitate this cime to act 
treacherously towards their mother-land when' the foreign 
Kushan aggression was at her throat. 
246. Had the Indian Buddhists put down the Sakas 
and founded a kingdom of their own, the Buddhist King 
would certainly have had the rightful claim to the credit of 
liberating India like any other Vedic King; and like the 
Vedic King Salivahan or Emperor Pushyamitra we would 
have gladly felicitated tbem. But how could the Buddhists 
ever show this staunch national spirit ! Even when Vedic 
patriotic republics and states like the Youdheyas and 
Satavahanas were engaged in a life and death struggle with 
the Saka-Kushans for a hundred and twentyfive years or 
more, these Indian Buddhists did not trouble themselves in 
the least for the cause of national liberty. But as soon 
as the strongest of these national enemies, Kanishka, 
104 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
proclaimed his conversion, albeit half-heartedly, to Buddhism, 
the whole of the Buddhist population submitted their mosi 
affectionate loyalty at the feet of that national foe. They 
extolled him like a God to the skies ! They prayed fervently 
in their vihars for the everlasting existence to that Saka- 
Kushan Mlenchcha State.*^. What wonder if the inevitable 
consequence followed ! As a result of the extreme hatred 
which the Vedic Hindus felt towards the Buddhists for their 
high treason. Buddhism continued to decline, as it had begun 
to do right from the time of Pushyamitra, in spite of the 
royal support of Emperor Kanishka, 
K A N I S H K A ' S G R A N D S O N E M B R A C E S V E D I C 
RELIGION 
247. Moreover, when Kanishka was killed, as has already 
been told, by his rebellious soldiers while he was fighting 
in China, the Indian Buddhists were in a miserable plight, 
as they found themselves utterly lost both ways. For, the 
successor of Kanishka, his son Emperor Havishka, remained 
comparatively cold in his sympathy towards the Buddhists*". 
And after Havishka, Kanishka's grandson, who became the 
ruler of the Saka-Kushans, actually abandoned Buddhism 
and embraced the Vedic cult with a public ceremony ! He 
even changed his original name and took for himself the 
purely Sanskrit appellation, Samrat Vasudeo*^ and struck 
coins with the images of Siva and Nandi imprinted on 
them*2 J 
AFTER KANISHKA S DEATH 
248. As soon as Emperor Kanishka died his Indian 
empire fell to pieces. His rule in India was not far extended 
even in north India. It was never very strong. It had 
covered only a small north-western strij) of India which 
comprised the Punjab, Malava, Sourashtra and Gujrath and 
a. small ribbonlike piece of land from the north-Konkan, 
which had formerly been in the hands of the Sakas. Now 
after the death of Kanishka, the two or three Saka kingdoms 
•3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH 105 
which formed part of this Kushan empire threw away the 
Kushan sovereignty and once again became independent. 
During the century-old Saka-Kushan aggressive wars, the 
Satavahanas had maintained the independence of their 
•entire Southern India unimpaired; and now the north-Indian 
states also, who had so far accepted the nominal overlordship 
of Kanishka, renounced it and regained their independence**. 
In this very confusion the principality of Pataliputra in the 
eastern part of India also became independent. 
ONCE AGAIN ROSE THE SUNKEN SUN OF 
PATALIPUTRA 
249. Pataliputra has been called a small principality 
in the previous line. Our readers might feel that it is.a slip 
of our pen. But it is not so. For during the deluge of the 
Saka-Kushan aggressions at the beginning of the Christian 
era the throne of Pataliputra, which was adorned by the 
celebrated Emperors like Chandragupta, Asoka, Pushyamitra 
and others and from which were guided for centuries together 
the destinies of the all-India empire from the Himalayas to 
the southern seas, was lost all of a sudden, just as the setting 
;sun vanishes while we are still looking on and know not when 
it has set. During the century-and-a-half of incessant Indian 
Avar Avitb the Saka-Kushans that followed, the separate 
existence of Pataliputra or Magadha was never felt. Some 
non-entity of a king from somewhere ruled and lived within 
the four walls of Pataliputra. 
250. But about the year 300 A.D. was established on 
this very principality of Pataliputra the rule of Lichchavi 
Republic, which was knoAvn in Magadha from the times of 
Lord Buddha**. 
251. The daughter of the chief of this Lichchavi 
Republic, Kumardevi, was wooed and married by a promising 
youth, son of a feudal chief, named Chandragupta in 308 AD**. 
With the strong support of the same Lichchavi Republic, he 
• established his sway over the surrounding territory and in 
• 320 A. D. he founded an independent kingdom in Pa tali-

putra*«. Let not this Chandragupta be confused with the 
famous Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, because of their 
similar names. Emperor Chandragupta belonged to the 
Maurya dynasty, while this promising Chandragupta was 
born in the Gupta family. His achievements, however, were 
as brilliant as would have befitted the glorious dynasty of 
Emperor Chandragupta Maurya. During his short reign of 
ten or eleven years he extended his small kingdom of 
Pataliputra wide enough to include Magadha, Prayag and 
Ayodhya so that the epithet of Maharaj should be applied 
to him deservedly*'. Entrusting his kingdom into the able 
hands of his son, Samudragupta, who was ambitious of 
uprooting the Mlenchcha power of the Saka-Kushans in the 
north-western part of India, and of establishing an extensive 
Indian empire, Chandragupta died in the year 330 A.D.**. 
This Gupta dynasty was a staunch adherent of the Vedic^ 
religion Shree Vishnu being their chief God of worship*^. 
EMPEROR SAMUDRAGUPTA 
252. As soon as he came to the throne, Samudragupta 
planned to conquer the several independent Indian States 
in the north as well as in the south and establish a strong 
Indian empire like the Mauryan Empire of Chandragupta 
and Chanakya and then to sweep over the still lingering 
Mlenchcha power of the Saka-Kushans in the north-western 
part of India with all the might of his empire. Accordingly he 
conquered Kamrup, Samatat, Nepal and all the region from 
north-eastern frontier provinces to the Vindhyas*". Thereafter 
crossing the Vindhyas, he entered South India with a 
powerful army. He conquered twelve prominent kingdoms in 
South India. Many of the defeated kings, after having 
been brought captives and after having accepted his over­ 
lordship, were granted their kingdoms and were allowed to 
go free. About these glorious campaigns of his in the north 
and south of India many western historians have spoken- 
with eloquent praise, giving him the best of their current 
phrases, "The Indian Napoleon"". After such an extensive 
3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH 107 
military expedition, Samudragupta returned to Pataliputra, 
Then in order to proclaim to the world his acquisition of 
this new Indian empire according to the Vedic religious rites 
he celebrated the Horse sacrifice*^, on a grand scale and was 
rightfully annointed a Samrat (an emperor). Thereafter he 
began his extensive preparations for his dash against the 
Saka-Kushans. 
THE FINAL SURRENDER BY THE KUSHANS. 
253. At the fearful reports of this impending attack of 
Emperor Samudragupta whatever small kingdoms of the 
Kushans like Gandhar and others were, still leading a 
precarious existence in the north-western regions of India,- 
voluntarily sued for peace and accepted the Gupta para- 
mountcy**. Our Indian ancestors at that time called these 
Kushans 'Kush' also. As a token of their surrender those 
Kushans sent rich offerings along with their personal envoys 
to Samudragupta. Thus after an incessant warfare for a 
century-and-a-half or two the Indian sword ultimately cut 
asunder the very root of the Kushan power in India. The 
Kushan problem was finally disposed of here and now ! 
254. But the Saka kings from Malava to Sindh who, as 
has been told in paragraphs 236 and 248, had thrown off the 
yoke of Andhra domination when the latter were engaged in 
a life and death struggle with Kanishka and later on, after 
the death of Kanishka, declared themselves free, did not on 
their own initiative talk of any submission. 
SAMRAT SAMUDRAGUPTA'S DEATH AND AFTER. 
255. While he was just preparing to march upon the 
Mlenchcha power of these Sakas, this powerful Emperor 
Samudragupta breathed his last in 375 A.D.**. He had 
expressed his wish that after him his younger but valiant and 
virile son, Chandragupta II, should be crowned emperor. But 
discarding this dying wish of his, the elder son, Ramgupta, 
ascended the throne on the strength of his seniority in 
age**. But he was so weak that almost all efficient ofiicials 
108 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
in his military and civil service and his ministers too began 
to hate him secretly. Just at this juncture a strange thing 
happened which galvanized the popular feeling against 
Bamgupta's feebleness. Although some historians consider 
this as a hearsay anecdote, still ancient writers, like 
Vishakhadatta and Banabhatta have credited it with truth 
and a reference to it is to be found in the copperplate grant 
of King Amoghvarsha*®. Again as in the comparatively 
recent times the Rajput warriors had faced a similar 
situation against Alla-ud-din in respect of Padmini, the 
opinion of some other historians that this anecdote about 
Ramgupta must be substantially true is the more acceptable. 
The incident in question may be summarised in the following 
manner :— 
256. Emperor Samudragupta having died and a weakling 
Ramgupta having ascended the throne after him, the 
Saka kings became fearless and began to behave insolently 
with the Magadhan empire which was on inimical terms with 
them. An impertinent and mean-minded Mlenchcha king of 
these Sakas commanded Ramgupta in order to humiliate him 
that he should send his young and beautiful wife, Grhdevi, 
to him or else be prepared for war*'. This insolent and 
wicked message convulsed the whole political atmosphere of 
the Magadhan empire with shame and indignation. But 
Emperor Ramgupta had become so utterly imbecile and 
shameless as to start preparations to send his queen, Grhdevi, 
to that Saka Satrap with the sole intention of avoiding a 
conflict**. This infuriated his younger brother, Chandragupta. 
Elouting Ramgupta's orders, he took Grhdevi under his 
protection*". Then resorting to guile, Chandragupta sent 
word to the Saka king that according to his commands Queen 
•Grhdevi was being sent to him, but that because of natural 
womanly bashfulness and modesty she would like to go in a 
•curtained palanquin. She was also to be accompanied by 
a retinue of her maids in similar litters. The Saka king was 
mad with joy to hear this message, and he replied that the 
•queen might be sent that way. Chandragupta, however, 
3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH 10» 
himself donned the female attire and sat in the Queen's 
palanquin, while in the accompanying ones, too, sat the 
chosen warriors in feminine garb. As the train (procession) of 
those covered palanquins drew near the capital of that Saka 
King, the latter, beside himself with joy, came forward to- 
the queen's palanquin to receive her in person; whereupon out 
came Chandragupta, in the guise of a woman, andpouncing 
on the unsuspecting Saka King slew him instantly with his. 
sword®". From other litters too, issued forth the warriors 
with drawn swords and before the shocking news of the 
slaughter of the Saka King could spread about they vanished 
along with Chandragupta quite out of the enemy's reach. 
257. The whole capital and the nation itself was 
resounding with the praise for Chandragupta when the glad 
news spread that Prince Chandragupta had returned to 
Pataliputra after accomplishing this unprecedented daring, 
feat and punishing with his own hands the Saka King, who 
had insulted the nation, with instant death. There was a 
great agitation to dethrone the cowardly Ramgupta who had 
ascended the throne of Magadha setting aside the last wish 
of the deceased emperor, Samudragupta, and to crown. 
Chandragupta in his place. In that commotion Ramgupta, 
was killed. Immediately Chandragupta was crowned 
emperor and he married the same Grhadevi whom he had 
with his exceptional valour saved from humiliation at the 
hands of the enemy®i. Later on with a well-equipped huge 
army Samrat Chandragupta marched upon the Saka Satraps. 
SAKA SATRAP RUDRASINGH KILLED ; THE LAST 
PHASE OF THE WAR WITH THE SAKAS 
258. When the war came to closed grips on the Gujarath- 
Malava frontier of the Saka dominions the Saka kings offered 
tough resistance at every place and at every place the 
Indian warriors crushed the enemy®^ ! In the last battle the 
remaining Saka Satrap, Rudrasingh, the son of Satyasingh, 
himself was killed by Chandragupta®*. 
110 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
THUS ENDED THE SAKA RULE 
259. Having thus vanquished the Sakas completely, 
Chandragupta liberated the provinces of Sindh, Kaccha, 
Sourashtra, Gujarath, Malava and others under their 
domination and incorporated them into his Indian empire®*. 
After such a total destruction of the Sakas, when Emperor 
Chandragupta entered the ancient and renoM^ned c i t y o f 
Ujjayini, which till a little while ago was the capital of the 
Saka kingdom, the people there celebrated his entry as a 
grand national festival. Samrat Chandragupta assumed the 
title of Vikramaditya®*. In order to immortalize his glorious 
and crushing victory over the Sakas, he renamed the so far 
Tiniversally current Malav Samvat itself as Vikram Samvat 
after his own name (cf. paragraph 222). He made Ujjayini 
the capital of the western part of his India-wide empire®®, 
and there he lived like a crowned King. 
260. How far can one describe the satisfaction and pride 
that the people all over Bharat felt at this decisive victory 
won by Vikramaditya over the Mlenchchas ? The whole of 
India became free from the foreign domination and became 
'Ekrat', united under one King! How profound must have 
been the joy and pride of Vikramaditya himself when he saw 
that the strenuous efforts and successes and failures of a 
hundred and fifty years or so of the Youdheyas, Malavas 
Vilivayankur (Vilinayankur ?) Satavahan and other great 
warriors for the destruction of the Saka power and of the 
valorous achievements of his grand-father and the national 
aspirations of Vedic Hindus had, at last borne such glorious 
fruit ! 261. Of this the English historian like Vincent Smith 
says though rather grudgingly, "We may feel assured that 
differences of race, creed and manner supplied the Gupta 
monarch with special reasons for desiring to suppress the 
impure foreign (i%^) rulers of Western India. Chandragupta 
Vikramaditya although tolerant of Buddhism and Jainism 
was himself an orthodox Hindu, especially devoted to the 
•cult of Vishnu and as such could not but have experienced 
3RD GLORIOUS EPOCH 111 
peculiar satisfaction in "violently uprooting the foreign 
chieftains". 
THE SAKAS TOO VANISHED 
262. In paragraph 230, it has already been described 
how the Sakas adopted the Vedic faith, Sanskrit language 
and Indian customs and manners. Now that Vikramaditya 
had utterly destroyed their political power with his 'mailed 
fist' they hereafter lost their separate existence as Sakas as 
distinct from the Indians. Only within two or three 
generations there was hardly any Saka to be seen in India, as 
it previously happened in the case of the Kushans. 
263. In the historical past, there lived and ruled good 
many Emperors in India, but there was hardly any as 
surprisingly popular as this Emperor Vikramaditya who 
exterminated the Saka-Kushans so thoroughly that not a 
trace of any of them is found today. Even a foreigner, the 
Chinese traveller, Fa-hien (or Fa-hsien), who visited India in 
his reign, has paid a glowing tribute to the prosperity, 
happiness, wealth and contentment that had reached its 
height, throughout the whole of the Indian empire under the 
Guptas®'. Even today in the innumerable Indian villages 
the name of King Vikramaditya and his high sense, and 
administration of, justice is lovingly sung in folk-tales and 
ballad. After having defended the powerful unitary Indian 
empire and developed it in every respect for more or less 
thirty-five years Samrat Vikramaditya died in 414 A.D®*. 
264. The epoch which began with the royal seal of 
Samrat Vikramaditya, the proud Victor of Saka-Kushans, 
is THE THIRD GLORIOUS EPOCH of Indian History. 
• * J U Glorious Epoch 
CHAPTER IV 
YASHODHARMA THE CONQUEROR OF THE HUNS 
T H E H U N N I S H O N S L A U G H T O V E R T H E W H O L E 
WORLD 
265. A reference has already been made earlier in this book to the Huns who routed all the Saka and Kushan tribes from their original homes and themselves occupied the vast tracts of lands. These very Huns, fiercer and far more cruel than their predecessors, now menaced not only the whole of Asia but also the whole of Europe. Every one of the then well-established, civilized, and strongly built nations and kingdoms of the world, right from China to Rome was rocked to its bottom at the very thought of this impending doom. There was no limit to their number nor were their raids limited to this region or that. 
266. When their armies marched out, thousands of their men and women carried fire and. sword to every city and every village that they entered and to every human being, young or old, child or woman, whom they came across. Not only by day but even at the very dead of night did they carry on these nefarious activities, shouting wildly like beasts and engulfing the enemy lands like wild fire. At the end of every bloody battle, they celebrated their victory 
4TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 113 
then and there, dancing wildly and drinking strong liquors in cups made of the very skulls of the slaughtered enemy soldiers and their women or children^. 
267. Being very close to the original Hunnish territory, almost all the provinces of the vast Chinese empire were rendered desolate because of their terrible raids^. The great China Wall of today is a glaring testimony to prove the incapacity of the Chinese Emperor to ward off these Hunnish locusts. The one great wonder of the world—this China Wall—is indeed the greatest monument to Hunnish Terror* ! 
268. One of the leaders of these Huns, Attila, organized these horsemen who pillaged Central Asia and made straight for Europe*. His various marauding armies dashed like an avalanche into European Russia through whichever inlet they could find and wrought havoc everywhere. Universities and art centres, houses and churches, the poor men's huts and rich palaces, towns and cities—whatever they could lay their hands on, these Huns went on reducing them to ashes*. Whoever came in their way was ruthlessly cut to pieces. After trampling down Russia they rushed into Poland, thence attacking the Goths in Germany and France*. Army after army of the once invincible Roman Empire was put to rout. These Huns loved not victory so much as they did ruin and destruction for its own sake. Consequently, the whole of Europe was not only defeated in war but was virtually bathed in blood and laid utterly waste. For a harrowing description of this devastation of Europe at the hands of these barbaric Huns, one shoidd read Gibbons' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.' Even today most of the European languages use 'Hun'' as the foulest of abuses, indicating thereby the horror with which they looked upon these devilish Huns. 269. In the very same manner did another avalanche of these Hunnish horses, which hovered for some time round about the Himalayas destroying whatever remained of the Saka-Kushan strongholds, dashed against regions like the Gandhar and others to the north-west ol India". With the 
114 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
very same energy and devilish ambition with which they 
devastated the empires of China, Russia, and Rome, did these 
Huns march impatiently to trample down India from end to 
end under their horses' hoofs, and began to force their way 
to the Indus. 
BUT 
270. Rut fortunately India was no longer being 
ruled by any coward like Dhananand who brought disgrace 
to the land at the time of the Greek invasion of the Punjab. 
It was now under the sovereignty of Kumargupta,* the 
illustrious son of Emperor Vikramaditya, the avenger of 
the Saka-Kushan domination. India at that time enjoyed the 
century-old Golden Age of the Gupta era. The Mauryan 
Golden Age saw, towards its close, the Indian military 
strength disorganized and powerless, because of the foolhardy 
Asokan policy of total non-violence (Ahimsa). But the Vedic 
India of this time under the leadership of Kumargupta did 
not allow the imperial army to degenerate in the least. Being 
always aware of the avalanche-like Hunnish onslaught, 
which was expected sooner or later. Emperor Kumargupta 
kept a very strong war-like and well-organized army,^" ever 
prepared to defend its frontiers. 
THE FIRST HUNNISH ONRUSH PARALYSED 
271. The moment he learnt of the Hunnish aggression 
on Gandhar, Kumargupta sent his valiant son, Skundgupta 
at the head of his four-fold ('^^'n) army to uproot the 
Hunnish menace". With their special technique based on 
their unlimited number, which had so far been unmatched for 
its efficacy, these Hunnish invaders began to make short work 
of the Indian frontier guards. No sooner did the Indian 
soldiers destroy one Hunnish army at a place, than would 
they emerge up from all other quarters, like ants pouring 
forth from their anthills. Even if these were completely wiped 
out, there would appear fresh ones creating confusion all over 
the land. The armies of Skundgupta fought battle after 
4TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 115 
battle with the irresistible Huns, destroying them steadily 
but surely for years together^^. The result was that even the 
innumerable forces of these Huns gradually lost their strength 
and energy and dared cross the frontiers of the Gupta Empire 
no more. Why, they could not even defend the places they 
held so far against the aggressive and fierce impact of the 
•Guptas. The remaining troops of the Huns, therefore, fled 
clean out of the Indian frontiers through the very passes they 
had come in. This crushing defeat kept the Huns away from 
India for the next forty years or so^'. 
THE BRAVE SKUNDGUPTA 
272. After having fought continuously for years on end 
and having defeated the most powerful enemy who had al­ 
ready brought to their knees the greatest empires of the world, 
Skundgupta proudly returned to his father at Pataliputra, 
where the victorious Prince was greeted with unprecedented 
enthusiasm, pomp and g l o r y O l d Emperor Kumargupta's 
joy can easily be imagined. It knew no bounds. In order 
to celebrate this singular success Kumargupta performed 
the Horse-sacrifice (sr'?^^) according to the age-old Indian 
tradition". 
DEATH OF KUMARGUPTA 
273. Shortly after this, the old emperor K u m a r g u p t a 
died, having satisfactorily fulfilled his life-mission. He was 
succeeded by his eminent son, Skundgupta, many of whose 
memorable deeds showing his rare abilities cannot be 
recounted here for M'ant of space and also because they do 
not directly bear upon the present theme. 
274. While Skundgupta was thus ruling in India another 
Hunnish adventurer, Khikhil by name, organized their scat­ 
tered forces in Asia, as Attila before him had done in Europe, 
and founded another kingdom and styled himself a king. 
Towards the end of Emperor Skundgupta's career this new 
Hunnish adventurer marched towards India at the head of a 
powerful army with a view to avenging the ignoble defeat the 
116 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Huns had earlier suffered here^®. 
SECOND HUNNISH INVASION OF INDIA 
275. During the very first encounters the Huns over­ 
threw the imperial frontier guards and drove them back at 
one or two places. No sooner did he hear of this fresh Hunnish 
aggression than Skundgupta, in spite of his old age, left his 
capital and marched as far as the Panchnad (the modern 
Punjab). While he was thus preoccupied in his military camp 
organising the overthrown imperial frontier forces for a coun­ 
ter-attack upon the enemy, he learnt that his step brother, 
Purgupta, was busy treacherously planning to usurp his 
throne". Nevertheless, the patriot Skundgupta, disregarding 
liis personal interests, kept on fighting the alien invaders in­ 
stead of speedily returning to the capital to settle his domestie 
trouble as some others in his place might have most probably 
done. Had he done so, and left the imperial army fighting 
without his guidance, the Indian soldiers would have, in all 
probability, lost courage and the invaders would have swept 
over the whole of the Punjab and at least the half of north 
India. As he was convinced of this impending calamity, he 
r a t h e r p r e f e r r e d fighting a g a i n s t t h e b a r b a r i c H u n s to 
returning home ! 
276. And even as he was fighting in the defence of bis 
mother-land did this aged warrior-king die about A.D. 471 
in his military camp, like a true King that he was^* ! 
"AN EMPEROR MUST DIE STANDING" 
277. An interesting anecdote is told about a well-known 
Roman Emperor who ruled in those 'palmy days of Rome,' 
that while he was lying on his death-bed in his royal palace, 
he once suddenly got up, sword in hand, and said to the 
frightened attendants, who suspected it to be a delirious fit, 
that a king must not die in his bed. " A Roman Emperor", 
he said, "must die standing"^*. 
278. In a like manner did this great Indian Emperor, 
Skundgupta, die in a small military camp fighting relent- 
4TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 117 
lessly, in spite of his failing years, the very enemy on whom 
he had inflicted severe defeats in his earlier career. Renoun­ 
cing all royal comforts and pleasures he spent almost fifteen 
to twenty years of his life suffering all the discomforts and 
hardships of a camp-life for the sole purpose of defending his 
empire and preserving the independence of his motherland, 
And when he did die, he did so fighting the arch-enemy of his 
nation, far away in a bivouac in the farthest province of the 
Punjab—not in his royal palace in the capital! If ever there 
was an ideal emperor, it was he ! 
279. If the Huns were hemmed in one small corner of the 
Indus and if India was saved all the indignities, massacres 
and wanton destruction at their hands to which Europe had 
been subjected almost contemporaneously, all the credit 
must go to the armed strength of Skundgupta. Although he 
died before the Huns were completely annihilated, his 
exemplary valour brought forth another generation of 
warriors, much stronger than before, to take the field against 
these once war-intoxicated but now enfeebled Huns. 
280. Hence we bow down to the memory of Emperor 
Skundgupta, with as much reverence and pride and a sense 
of national gratitude as we might do to any other conqueror 
like Vikramaditya. 
AFTER THE DEATH OF SKUNDGUPTA 
281. Subsequent to the death of Skundgupta the throne 
of Magadha was usurped by his rebel brother, Purgupta, 
whose lack of every sort of ability encouraged the Huns 
once again to push forward under their King, Khikhil. In 
the reign of Torman, who succeeded Khikhil, Huns once 
again let loose the dogs of war and Kamboj, Gandhar, and 
the Punjab suffered most from their horrible depredations 
and arson^o. The world-famous University of Taxila was 
raised to the ground^^. Thousands of its invaluable books 
only served to make bonfire for the Huns. 
282. This is another instance that shows how even the 
national literature, civilization and culture are destroyed at 
118 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
the hands of foreign invaders, if they are not defended and 
supported by the nation's mailed fist. 
283. In the meanwhile, those Hunnish hordes which had 
so far overrun the kingdom of Persia, and in A.D. 484 put 
her King, Phiroz, to death, were now free to join the army 
of Torman in his work of reducing India to the same miser­ 
able state^^. With his army so suddenly augmented, Torman 
pushed ahead of the Punjab into Malava and captured it 
round about 511 A.D.^^, along with its capital Ujjain. When 
Torman's son, Mihirgula, who was braver and more atrocious 
than the father, succeeded to the Hunnish throne, strangely 
enough he became a sincere devotee of the Vedic God, Rudra 
and held the cult of Buddha in the greatest spite. 
MIHIRGULA, THE DEVOTEE OF THE 
VEDIC GOD 
284. Strange as it may seem the Huns were speedily 
attracted to the worship of the Vedic God Rudra at least 
from the time they entered the north-western frontier 
province. Of these people Vincent Smith says, "The savage 
invader who worshipped his patron deity Shiva, the God of 
Destruction, exhibited ferocious hostility against the peaceful 
Buddhistic cult and remorselessly overthrew the Stupas and 
Monasteries which he plundered of their treasures^*". 
THE PATRIOTIC VEDIC HINDUS AND 
TREACHEROUS BUDDHISTS 
285. In this context the readers are referred to para­ 
graphs 182 to 209 and 245 to 246 of this book wherein we 
have commented on the patriotic spirit of the Vedic Hindus 
and the treacherous attitude of the Buddhists. In order to 
vouchsafe this comment of ours this incident of Mihirgula 
should be most significant. 
286. Even when this Hunnish aggressor Mihirgula had 
accepted the Vedic cult of God Rudra and brutally 
oppressed the Buddhists, who had become inveterate 
enemies of the Vedic Hindus, the latter did not accept his 
4TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 119 
political dominance, nor did they ever join him in his atrocities against their own rivals. In spite of his avowed acceptance of the Vedic cult, Mihirgula was looked upon as a foreign aggressor and as such a national enemy by the Vedic Hindus. They avowed enmity towards him for the sake of making politically free those regions which had so far gone under his sway. It cannot be denied that even amongst the Vedic Hindus, kings like Kamboj and Jaichand did commit treason earlier or later, but on the whole the Vedic community had all along been hating the non-Vedic people and had been giving terrible battles for protecting the independence and imperial power of their nation unimpaired. Even the English historians, like Smith, could not help mentioning, maybe in malicious terms, this strong national feeling of the Vedic people. While stating in general terms that these Vedic Hindus were the born enemies of any foreign political power, trying to subdue the country, he says, "Those foreign tribes, Sakas, Pahlavas and lonians (Yavanas), at the time settled in the Western India as the lords of a conquered population, were the objects of hostility 
of the Vedic King Vilivayankur II He recovered the losses which his kingdom had suffered at the hands of the intruding foreigners and utterly destroyed the power of (the Saka King) Nahapan. The hostility of the Andhra (Vedic) monarch was stimulated by the disgust felt by all the Hindus, and especially by the followers of the Orthodox Brahmanical system of the outlandish foreign barbarians^*". 
287. It should not surprise the reader if he finds in this observation of Smith a faint echo of an Englishman's heart-ache at his own painful experience of the British: Imperial Colonies. KING YASHODHARMA 
288. Under the undeserving and weak Purgupta the suzerainty of Magadha began to be flouted and disregarded by almost every one. Most of the vassals of the Gupta Empire and even the provinces and principalities began to 
120 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
rule themselves independently. All these virtually subordinate 
but actually independent provinces and different feudal 
lords feared the political dominance of the Huns which had 
by then spread as far as Malava. Everybody was seething 
with indignation at seeing a foreign tyrant like Mihirgula 
occupy the throne of the Great Vikramaditya at Ujjain, 
and every patriotic Vedic Indian was anxious to see the 
Huns overpowered and routed at the earliest opportunity. 
Yet none of all these smaller states and provinces had the 
courage to take any aggressive move against these Huns. 
Nobody could broach the subject openly. 
289. At such a critical time an adventurous youth 
vowed to solve this knotty problem. He was not even a 
titular king or emperor. He was merely a small chieftain, 
Yashodharma by name, of a relatively small principality in 
the province of Malava^®. But his ambition, his sense of 
patriotism and his daring spirit were as lofty and powerful 
as to challenge the might of the mightiest and pompously 
styled 'King of Kings' of the Huns, Mihirgula, and dethrone 
him and to destroy the Hunnish influence root and branch. 
A COMMON FRONT OF THE VEDIC KINGS 
290. First of all he organized almost all the neighbour­ 
ing independent Indian states with a view to fight out the 
Hunnish manace^'. Even Baladitya of Magadha supported 
this organized war effort and under the leadership of King 
Yashodharma all these kings marched against the Huns from 
all sides. This well organized Indian Army could do what 
none else could think of doing single-handed, and the most 
powerful Hunnish army began to be slaughtered on the 
battlefields of Indians. 
DEFEAT OF THE HUNS . CAPTURE OF 
MIHIRGULA HIMSELF 
291. In the end, the Supreme Commander, Yashodharma 
marched at the head of a very powerful army on Mihirgula 
himself, and joining battle at Mandasore or Korur some- 
4TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 121 
time about A.D. 628 overthrew the Hunnish dragon for ever. After a very savage man-slaughter Mihirgula himself became a captive of King Yashodharma^'. 
292. This singular success resounded thunderously throughout the length and breadth of India. 
293. And in order to avenge the numerous atrocities that Huns in general and Mihirgula in particular had so far perpetrated against the Indian population, King Yashodharma forthwith ordered the hanging of Mihirgula*". 
BALADITYA'S ANTI-NATIONAL GENEROSITY 
294. But as soon as Baladitya, the Emperor of Magadha, learnt of this death-sentence passed on Mihirgula by King Yashodharma, he, as a member of the Combined Front, insisted that the Hun be spared and be handed over to him alive. Yashodharma did so only to avoid displeasing 
3aladitya. Whether according to a secret treaty with Mihirgula to serve some selfish end of his or under some 
•disastrous delusion of the so-called superhuman generosity consisting in the release of the deadliest enemy, who deserved nothing but hanging, a delusion which seems almost permeated through the very veins of the Indian people, Baladitya spared not only Mibirgula's life but even allowed him to go honourably to the remnant of the Hunnish terri­ tory to the north-west*^. A great many years after him, Prithviraj allowed another inveterate enemy, Mohammed 
•Ghori, to go scot free !

(Payah-panam Bhujanganam Kevalam Vishwardhan) 
295. Thanking his good stars, Mihirgula hurried straight to Kashmir where he secretly organized the Huns and killed the king, annexed Gandhar, persecuted the people of the land and especially liquidated the pockets of Buddhist influence after slaughtering wholesale thousands ot Buddhist 
•monks and nuns*^. 122 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
296. It is very difficult to say if fate had brought to 
life this Mihirgula only to give a practical lesson to the 
Indian Buddhists -who were intoxicated by the delirious idea, 
viz. 'Religious victory was greater than arnaed victory' and 
to show that without one's own armed support even Religion, 
cannot survive the onslaughts of the barbarous enemy's fire 
and sword. 
297. Nevertheless, these milksops of the Buddhists who- 
were sorely distressed at these persecutions did not fail to 
use the only weapon they had to avenge themselves on. 
Mihirgula. Only when Mihirgula died a perfectly natural 
death, these Buddhists recorded his death in their myths, 
sending him forthwith to hell. "When this demon of a Hun,. 
Mihirgula, died", they wrote, "and went to eternal hell to 
atone for his hatred towards Lord Buddha and to suffer 
inhuman pangs, the Earth broke into two by the very shock.. 
It rained as heavily as the Deluge of Manu, and the birds 
and beasts ran helter-skelter crying horribly. Many other 
upheavals also took place**. 
297-A. For these en-feebled Buddhists, was there any 
other way open for consolation than to imagine themselves 
the unlimited tortures in the infernal fires of purgatory or 
the hell or the 'narak', as we Indians should like to style the 
place, a terrible enemy, whom they dared not think of 
harming in the least while yet he lived in this world suffered ? 
But wasn't this consolation of these non-violent Buddhists, 
violent ? Is it kindness or extreme cruelty ? 
T H E V I C T O R I O U S E N T R Y O F Y A S H O D H A R M A 
INTO UJJAIN ! 
298. After vanquishing Mihirgula completely Yasho­ 
dharma overthrew all H u n n i s h influence from the Panchnad 
and after having re-established Indian rule in this newly 
freed land, he returned to Malava with his victorious army. 
With great pomp and ceremony did this Yashodharma 
enter Ujjain** which had the reputation of being the capital 
of India since the time of Vikramaditya, and which he had. 
4TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 12$ 
freed anew from the foreign yoke. Now he did not remain 
a simple king but had become the king of kings, Maharaja- 
dhiraj**! He erected two pillars to commemorate the 
victory of the Indian patriots against the Huns*®. They- 
even now testify to the gratification that the people of these- 
times might have then felt. 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HUNS NEXT ? 
299. What else could have happened to them ? They 
met with the same fate that their foreruimers the lonians, the 
Sakas, the Parthians and the other aggressors did. Soon 
after Mihirgula died round about A.D. 540 the Hunnish states- 
in the north-west region beyond the Indus valley dwindled 
into insignificance within a generation or two and perished 
completely*'. After wresting political power from the Huns 
the Vedic Hindu kings once again began to rule right up to- 
the Hindukush**. The moment they lost political power, 
because of an armed might stronger than their own, the Huns 
became as meek lambs. Dr. Jayaswal writes, "The Huns 
were fully crushed within a century by the successive (Hindu), 
dynasties*'." Because of the great losses in their ranks, suff­ 
ered during a century of incessant warfare with the Hindus- 
Hunnish population diminished rapidly in numbers. Whoso­ 
ever remained took over willingly to Indian religions and. 
languages and customs and within a generation or two 
merged so completely with the Hindus that they could never 
recollect their Hunnish extraction. 
300. Vincent Smith has the following comments to offer 
on the far-rea ching effects of this decisive Indian victory 
over the Huns : "After the defeat of Mihirgula and the 
extinction of the Hun Power on the Oxus, India enjoyed 
immunity from foreign attacks for nearly five centuries*"." 
300-A. It clearly [means that after the defeat of Mihir­ 
gula at the hands of Yashodharma and after the end of the 
Hun empire beyond the Oxus there was no foreign aggression 
over India for nearly five centuries to come. Thus the whole 
of India, right from Pariyatra (Hindukush), Gandhar^ 
124 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Kashmir, the Punjab and Sindh straight to Kanyakumari, enjoyed under the Hindu Kings prosperity and happiness for nearly five hundred years. The whole of Bharat was independent, powerful, wealthy and happy! 
A RESUME OF THE ANCIENT PERIOD IN INDIAN HISTORY 
301-307. If by the Ancient Period in Indian History we mean the one from B.C. 600 to A.D. 700,—a period as large as 1300 years—and if the succeeding period is called the modern, it is in the fitness of things that here and now should end that period so far as the subject matter of this book is concerned. Some of the historical points pertaining to this ancient period—which should very carefully be impressed on the minds of our young men and women and the general reader, but which are generally lost sight of, are briefly dealt with here in this conclusion : 
(1) In this ancient period no foreign aggressor could ever conquer the whole of India at any time. This fact generally 
•escapes the notice of good many of the foreigners as of our own men, while some deliberately neglect it or pervert it. On reading such titles of Chapters as 'Alexander's Invasion of India' 'Saka aggression on India", foreign as well as native readers are generally misled into a belief that the whole of India was overrun either by Alexander or by the Huns, and lost its independence. Under this delusion many of the 
•enemies of India and her so-called well-wishers have raised such objections and propounded such theories as to mean that the whole life of the Indian nation—i.e. the Hindu nation—has passed imder in foreign slavery. It is to bring to light and refute this foolish and wicked charge and to show that it is due to either unintentional ignorance or wilful malice that such theories are ever propounded, that this book has been purposely written. 
So from the foregoing narration it should be clear that— (2) Right from Nepal to Eastern Sea (Bay of Bengal) the whole of northern and eastern India and southern India, 
4TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 125 
that is to say, practically three-fourths of this great continent, 
of India, remained completely independent of any foreign 
domination for these 1300 years. No aggressor by sea or 
land could ever reduce it completely to slavery. 
(3) Of the remaining western and northern India, 
roughly about 1/4 of the continent was only once traversed, 
by a^foreigner. Sakas and Kushans held the north-westera 
tract of land between the Punjab and Gujrat for some time. 
The Huns could barely reach Ujjain. How miserably these 
national foes suffered at the hands of Indian nationals has. 
been briefly described in the foregoing pages., 
(4) Hardly any other contemporary nation of the world 
will be seen to have so successfully destroyed the foreign 
aggressors and maintained its national independence for such, 
a length of time—not less than 1300 years. 
(5) It is not only India that these lonians, Sakas and. 
Huns and other aggressors invaded. Some of them disrupted 
almost all the other nations ! of the then known world and 
brought in the so-called Dark Ages. They threw some of the 
other nations into complete oblivion—a fact which must 
always be kept in view when comparing them with India in 
respect of these barbaric aggressions. 
(6) These very barbaric aggressors who came in such 
large numbers carrying powerful weapons with the diabolie 
ambition of annihilating the whole of the Indian continent 
were themselves reduced by the Indian warriors to ashes in 
the conflagration of a general war, their beastly instincts, 
being purified in the martial fires and merged in the vast 
Indian multitude so completely that even their name (^ITT)- 
did not remain (^} behind them ! 
308. Let us for a moment imagine that a certain Angel 
who had been observing the affairs of this Earth at that time 
and has once again come down on the Himalayan peaks and 
is surveying the Indian scene. Not,knowing what happened 
during the intervening years he began to ask from the peak : 
"Well, are there still left over in this continent of India any 
of the lonians (Greeks) who had once founded a kingdom in a 
126 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
.small corner of this vast piece of knd ?" If any Angel does inquire this way, there is unfortunately no one left to tell him, "Well, I am he—their descendant \" If again the Angel asks, "In one part of India there were some kingdoms and -communities of Sakas and the Kushans. Is there anyone of them to be found here now?" To answer this question in the affirmative there is unluckily none left. No one can be found today to say, "Yes, I am Saka" or "I am a Kushan." Were he again to ask for the third time "At least some of the gentlemen belonging to the Hun clan who had once harassed the whole of the world and who had once advanced up to Ujjain must be found here ! Are there any such ? Even to this question no one can proudly say today "Why not ? Here J am their direct descendant". 
309. But if the awe-stricken Angel asks again, "Well, tell me at least if there is any yet left of those Hindus who fought bravely with all these foreign aggressors and ruled 
•over India ?" Then the answer, "Yes, I am that Hindu ! I am he !" would spring from more than three hundred million mouths in this country and prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the deep rooted foundations and the grand edifice of the Hindu nation and the Hindu State I 
310. So this can be fittingly called THE FOURTH 
•GLORIOUS EPOCH of Indian History glittering in the lustrous martial achievements of the most daring and successful emperor, Y A S H O D H A R M A !

"The Mohamedan conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace may at any time be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within"

Glorious Epoch 
CHAPTER V 
THE CLIMAX OF MAHARASHTRIAN VALOUR ! 
THE MARATHA STANDARD FLUTTERS PROUDLY OVER ATTOCK 
NATURE OF THE MILLENNIAL HESDU-MUSLIM STRUGGLE 
311. The scope of this book, 'Six Glorious Epochs of Indian History', has already been explained in Chapter I (paras: 4 to 8) from which it should be clear that a detailed account of the continuous, long-drawn, fierce and gigantic Hindu-Muslim struggle is not intended here. What we intend to do here is to examine thoroughly and from the Hindu stand­ point this epic struggle and the period covered by it as searchingly, as faithfully and as fearlessly as it ought to have been done—but unfortunately has not so far been done. 
312. For even today it is absolutely essential and beneficial to the interests of the Hindu Nation. 
TWO AGES OF OUR HISTORY : ANCIENT AND MODERN 
313. We feel that our History is naturally divided by 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 129 
the course of events into two great ages : the Ancient and the 
Modern ; the first, ending with the seventh century, and the 
second, stretching from the beginnings of the eighth century 
to the present day. In the preceding four chapters we have 
dealt with the vast ancient period of about a thousand years 
or so, while we intend to analyse, in the following nineteen 
chapters, the course of events in this modern age of Hindu 
History. 
314. In doing so detailed accounts of the many stray 
events supporting our main thesis will certainly be given 
where necessary and the chronological sequence will also be 
maintained. But the chronological details will not be allowed 
to crowd up the limited space at our disposal, as they are 
easily available in various big or small volumes by many 
other writers. Hence our whole attention will be focussed 
mainly on the bearings of different important points in the 
subject rbatter in hand, rather than, though not without 
regard to, the cbronological order. 
THE EPIC HINDU-MUSLIM WAR 
315. The struggle on the two fronts in all the bloody 
wars fought at every Muslim invasion right from the begin­ 
ning of this modern age was hitherto unknown and unheard 
of. For the Greek, Saka, Hun and other invaders, who came 
pouring in down the plains of the Punjab, had political 
domination of this country as their sole objective. Barring 
this political aim their raids had never been occasioned by 
any cultural or religious hatred. On the other hand, these 
new Islamic enemies not only aspired to crush the Hindu 
political power and establish in its place Muslim sovereignty 
over the whole of India, but they also had, seething in their 
brains another fierce religious ambition, not heretofore 
dreamt of by any of the old enemies of India. Intoxicated 
by this religious ambition, which was many times more 
diabolic than their political one. These millions of Muslim- 
invaders from all over Asia fell over India century after cen­ 
tury with all the ferocity at their command to destroy the 
130 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Hindu religion which was the life-blood of the Nation. 
THE OUTRAGEOUS CHRISTIAN INCURSION 
316. To add to these catastrophic Muslim inroads over 
India Christian nations like the Portuguese, the Dutch, the 
French, the British and others rushed upon our nation from 
the sea, round about the fifteenth century A.D.—even if we 
were to ignore the infiltration of the Syrian Christians in the 
Malabar during the 1st century A.D. This Christian offensive, 
like the Muslim one, was both political and religious and 
equally devilish. They also wrought havoc by converting 
millions of Hindus at the point of the bayonet—an account 
of which will be given at its proper place. 
317. Although the two fronts of this Muslim aggression, 
viz., the religious and political, were only the two parts of the 
same epic Hindu-Muslim struggle, their original forms, their 
weapons of war and their ultimate end were altogether 
different. Naturally, they have to be discussed separately, 
as far as it is possible to do so. 
318. Hence we shall first examine the religious aspect 
of the Muslim-Christian aggression over our country in 
Chapters VI to XII and then in Chapters 13 to 22 of this 
book we shall discuss its political side. 
• 
ti 
CHAPTER VI 
BEGINNING OF MUSLIM BVCURSION 
319. We have already pointed out—and shall do so hereafter—how the histories written not only by foreigii historians or those who are avowedly inimical to us, but even by our own people, ignore the glorious episodes of exceptional valour and monumental successes of the Hindus and in their stead, catalogue only the calamities that befell them and present them as the only true history of the Hindus, because they were never fearlessly written from the pure and simple Hindu standpoint. We have already referred to many such instances, in the first four chapters in support of our conten­ tion and will do so even in the following pages. The period under consideration here is an instance in point. 
320. Generally speaking in all histories, especially in the history text-books used in schools, the writers invariably jump from an account of the Hunnish onslaught to the first Successful Muslim campaign on Sindh, without writing even a line or two about the intervening long period of these hundred years or so. Next follow in quick succession the detailed narration of Muslim invasions one after another, so that a common reader, especially a pupil, catches an impression, which is very often carried even in his later life, that the his­ tory of the Hindus is nothing but a doleful tale of foreign subjugation and national defeats. Our enemies have publi­ cized these false impressions as established facts all over the world for the last two or three centuries. For instance, a man like the late Dr. Ambedkar, burning with hatred against Hinduism, writes : 
" The Hindus, has been a life of a continuous defeat. It is a mode of survival of which every Hindu will feel ashamed^." 132 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
321. In fact, historical evidence shows that after the total 
rout of the Huns, that is to say, since about A.D. 550 Hindu 
Kings and emperors successfully crossed the Indus at various 
places^ and reconquered not only what are now known as 
Sindh, Baluchistan, Afghanistan, Herab, Hindukush, Gilgit, 
Kashmir and many other regions from the Greeks, the Huns, 
the Sakas and other foreign peoples, but hoisted the victorious 
n a t i o n a l flag o f t h e V e d i c H i n d u s f a r b e y o n d t h e n o r t h ­ 
western boundaries of Chandragupta Maurya's empire upto 
Utter Kurus ! Why, even in Khotan in Central Asia beyond 
Kashmir, there ruled Hindu kings and, in the opinion of 
many historians, even Gazani was ruled by King Sheeladitya*. 
THE REJUVENASCENT HINDU NATION 
322. Even the foreign historians like Vincent Smith are 
astounded at the enduring ability of the Hindu nation to 
rejuvenate itself after crushing defeats. For a detailed 
account of this period and Smith's glowing tribute to the 
successful struggle for independence of the Hindus the 
curious readers are advised to refer to the concluding portion 
of Chapter IV of this book. Only one sentence will suffice 
here. 322-A. "After the defeat of Mihirgula (by the Hindus) 
and the extinction of the Hun power, India enjoyed immunity 
from foreign attack for nearly five centuries*." 
323. Smith has thus completely refuted the extravagant 
and vulgar remarks of Dr. Ambedkar on Hindu history. 
THE BEGINNINGS OF THE AWEFUL MUSLIM WAR WITH INDIA 
324. It is generally believed that Mohammed Bin Kasim 
was the first of the Arabian or Muslim invaders to march 
upon Sindh. But in fact it was at least fifty years before 
him that other Arabian Muslims had started picking up 
quarrels with the Brahmin kings of Sindh*. They had even 
tried an armed aggression®. Yet we do not intend to dilate 
upon the systematic and chronological account of these 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 133 
various skirmishes by armed bands or military detachments'. 
It is enough for our purpose to bear in mind that all these 
attempts were foiled successfully by the Hindus*. At length 
Usman', the governor of the Grand Khalipha's distant 
province of Oman, openely attacked the Hindu state of Sindh. 
The then Brahmin King of Sindh, Chacha, vanquished not 
only these Arabs, but killed their very Commander-in-Chief, 
Abdul Aziz, in a battle^". After these sporadic attempts 
till about A.D. 640, the Arabs did not undertake any 
important expedition, with perhaps the only exception of the 
small distant province of Makram^^, which they reduced 
to ashes converting the Hindus there at the point of the 
sword to the Muslim faith^^. These Hindu Baluchistanian 
converts of those days became later on bigoted Muslims. 
T H E F I R S T B I G M U S L I M E X P E D I T I O N 
AGAINST SINDH 
325. Thereafter it was in A.D. 711 that Mohammed 
Bin-Kasim launched the first large-scale offensive against 
S i n d h w i t h a h u g e a r m y , fifty-thousand s t r o n g ^ * . T h e 
majority of the population of Sindh, then, was Vedic Hindus, 
with King Dahir at the head of the state, while, only a small 
minority was the follower of Lord Buddha. Formerly, when 
Sindh was under the Huns, their last King Mihirgula had 
persecuted the Buddhists very cruelly, because in spite of his 
Hunnish extraction, he had become a faithful follower of the 
Vedic religion and hated Buddhism for its feebleness^*. 
(Chapter 4—Paragraphs 284 & 285.) But after Mihirgula, when 
Sindh went under the sway of the Vedic Hindu Kings, the 
Buddhists no longer suffered any such persecution. They 
were free to follow their own religion so far as it concerned 
only with their own selves. 
THE BUDDHIST TRAITORS 
326. Nevertheless, these Indian Buddhists were elated, 
to see the Muslim foreigners march against the Hindu 
kingdom. These Buddhists, who bore malice towards the 
134 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Hindus, perhaps thought that these new Muslim aggressors 
might embrace their Buddhist cult, as did their forerunners, 
the Greeks under Menander or the Kushans under Kanishka, 
and establish a Buddhist empire over India. So they went and 
greeted the Arabian-Muslim leader, when he captured Port 
Deval from the hands of King Dahir^*. They appealed to 
him in some such way as the following :— 
326-A. "We have nothing to do with Dahir and his 
Vedic Hindu cult. Our religious faith differs very widely 
from theirs. Our Prophet, Lord Buddha, has taught us 
'Ahimsa.' (Total Abstinence From Violence). We never take 
arms and dabble with political affairs of the state. Whoever 
wins and be the ruler of the state, we obey him in all matters 
temporal. You are now the victor, so now you are our King t 
Never suspect for a moment that we shall even enlist 
ourselves in Dahir's armed forces or help him in any way. So 
we pray that the Buddhists should not be subjected to any 
indignities or troubles at your hands." 
326-B. Complying with some such request of the 
Buddhists which amounted to complete surrender, the arch 
diplomat Kasim gave them temporary assurance of safety". 
327. On receiving the news of the fall of Port Deval, 
King Dahir, on the other hand, mobilized his army and 
took the field". Kasim, too, on his part, went ahead subju­ 
gating some parts of Sindh. The Muslim-writers of Tarikhs 
(reports)^*, who have recorded the details of this campaign, 
testify that the Buddhists in Sindh helped the Muslims in 
every possible way^', while the latter marched onwards, by 
showing them difficult passes, providing tbem with foodstuff 
and fodder and supplying them secret military intelligence. 
Some few Vedic Hindus also were guilty of this treachery; 
but their attempts were individual and exceptional. 
KING DAHIR DIES FIGHTING ON THE 
BATTLEFIELD 
328. At last, the main forces of the Muslims and the 
Hindus joined battle at Brahmanabad^". The Hindus fought 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 135 
fiercely. Although the Muslims then had no cannon, they 
h a d fire-arms o f a n e w t y p e , w h i c h t h e H i n d u s d i d n o t 
possess^i. Naturally the latter began to find themselves 
weaker in strength. Moreover the Arab platoons that were 
in the pay of Dahir rebelled^^. When the Hindu-Muslim 
armies came to close quarters, the Arabs informed him that 
t h e y w o u l d n o t fight a g a i n s t M o h a m m e d - B i n - K a s i m , 
since the latter was a Muslim, as they themselves were, and 
that it was a religious crusade against the Kafirs^*. What 
more, they even marched on their Hindu master himself. 
This artlessness of the Hindus in placing complete faith in 
the enemy met the same fate, whenever in future a Hindu 
King employed Muslim soldiers in his army. This very often 
caused the Hindu strategy to topple down and made their 
battle-arrays ineffective**. 
329. Nevertheless, without letting this betrayal of the 
Arab platoons cause any confusion in his ranks. King Dahir 
mounted his elephant and kept on fighting in the thick of 
the fray**. But when he himself was killed in the battle, the 
Hindu army was routed, and the Muslims, in hot pursuit, 
entered the city*®. 
330. However, the moment she received the horrible 
news of King Dahir's death on the battle-field, the Queen 
and hundreds of other brave Hindu ladies leapt into a great 
fire and burnt themselves to death*'. It was the limit of 
warlike spirit, the Kshatriyadharma ! The enemy's attempts 
to capture and molest the Queen and other ladies of high-rank 
were mostly foiled. 
331. Even then, in the confusion that was wrought 
everywhere, Daheer's two daughters named Suryadevi and 
Pramiladevi fell** into the hands of the Muslims who had 
dashed into the city, killing every captive soldier and 
every citizen*'. Mohammed Kasim took them and also 
hundreds of others away as courtesans. The looting and 
massacre of the Hindus and large-scale arson in the city went 
on unhindered. But that was the fate of not only one city; 
every other city or town that the Muslims visited on their 
136 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
onward march through Sindh met with the same disaster*". 
B U T W H A T W E R E T H E B U D D H I S T S D O I N G IN T H I S 
NATIONAL CATASTROPHE ? 
332. At the fnews of the fall of King Dahir and the 
victory of the Muslims, these Buddhists began to ring bells 
in their vihars*^ to greet the Muslim conquerors, and prayed 
in congregations for the prosperity of the Muslim rulers ! 
333. But what they thus asked for as a boon proved 
to be an inexorable curse for them. After winning the final 
battle, when the Muslims rushed violently, like a stormy 
wind, throughout Sindh, they went on beheading these 
Buddhists even more ruthlessly than they did the Vedic 
Hindus**. For, the Vedic Hindus were fighting in groups or 
individually at every place and so they struck atleast a 
little awe and terror in the minds of the Muslims. But as 
there was no armed opposition in Buddhist Vihars and 
Buddhist localities, the Muslims cut them down as easily as 
they would cut vegetable. Only those of the Buddhists who 
took to the Muslim faith were spared, while all their vihars 
throughout Sindh and the innumerable shrines in them were 
knocked down, and hammered to pieces ; for the Muslims 
hated these 'Buddh parastis'—these shrine-worshippers. 
334. The very word, "Buddhaparasta", which found its 
way into the Islamic tongue, is itself a corrupt form of the 
original Sanskrit work of the Buddhists, 'Buddhaparastha'. 
The Muslims began to call the shrine-worshippers 'Buddha- 
parashta' because on their way to India they first found such 
numerous shrines nowhere but in the Buddhist Vihars. To 
annihilate such shrine-worshippers was for the Muslims a sort 
of religious commandment**. 
BUDDHIST AHIMSA AND MUSLIM HIMSA 
335. This is now the place where the question that we 
have discussed at length in Chapter II (Paras 152 to 159) of 
this book, about the downfall of Buddhism in India should be 
chronologically concluded. By the year A.D. 700, of which 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 137 
we are speaking in these pages, that is, before the Muslims 
could set foot in India towards Sindh, the Buddhists all over 
India were fast diminishing in numbers and dwindling into 
non-existence as is already shown in previous chapters. The 
successful theoretical refutation of the Buddhist philosophy 
and religious tenets by the stalwart Vedic theologians and 
'pandits'** is not the only cause of the total extinction of the 
Buddhists in India ; many other social and political events 
also had a fair share in this momentous task. Of them only 
those which have not received the proper attention from the 
historians so far, or which have not been given enough 
prominence which they really deserve, will be conspicuously 
referred to at their proper places in these brief concluding 
remarks. 
THE FIRST CAUSE : THE BUDDHIST HIGH 
TREASON 
336. We have already dwelt at length on this collective 
high treason of the Buddhists in India against their nation 
in Ch. II Paras 162 to 159 ; 182-209, and Ch. Ill Paras 242- 
246 of this book. Because of this treacherous mentality of the 
Buddhists, the whole of the patriotic and politically 
conscious Indian population was up in arms to destroy them 
rootand branch. Being convinced beyond doubt by actual 
•experience that these Buddhist congregations (Buddha- 
sangha) were inherently anti-national and unpatriotic, and 
treacherous institutions, the patriotic politicians and the 
iingly courts gave them hardly any support anywhere in 
India. Especially in the north about the year A.D. 700 as 
the new Rajput Kingdoms which were the staunch support­ 
ers of the Vedic religion, began to prosper**, the Buddhist 
population and the Buddhist cult were rendered helpless, 
socially boycotted, weak and invalid everywhere in India. 
THE SECOND REASON : fFANATIC BUDDHIST 
AHIMSA 
337. Just as the patriotic and politically conscious 
138 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
population of India became impatient with the Buddhist cult, 
so was the general populace disgusted with the harassment of 
Buddhist Ahimsa. At times—though few and far between 
—when the Buddhists gained the greatest political power over 
the major portion of India as in the times of Asoka and Shree 
Harsha, they enforced the Buddhist tenets on the Vedic 
Hindus by misusing their political authority. The writings 
of the times are replete with copious references to, and 
illustrations of, the religious persecution carried on by the 
Buddhists on those occasions. Yet if passages are quoted 
from some Vedic books, some over-sensitive soul might doubt 
their veracity as they occur from an opponent's mouth. 
Hence we are adducing a specimen clearly how vehemently the 
foreign and non-Vedic historians have criticized it. Vincent 
Smith in his 'Early History of India' has this to say— 
338. "It is recorded by contemporary testimony that 
in the seventh century King Harsha, who obviously aimed at- 
copying closely the institutions of Asoka did not shrink from 
inflicting capital punishment without hope of pardon on any 
person who dared to infringe his commands by slaying any- 
animal or using flesh as food in any part of his dominion. 
Kumar Pal, a Jain King of Gujrath, imposed savage penalties 
upon violators of his (similar) rules. An unlucky merchant 
who had committed the atrocious crime of cracking a louse 
was brought before a special court at Anilhawada and puni­ 
shed with the confiscation of his whole property'®. Another 
wretch who had outraged the sanctity of the capital by- 
bringing a dish of raw meat was put to death. The special 
court constituted by Kumar Pal (for this purpose) had 
functions similar to those of Asoka's censors. And the 
working of the later institutions sheds light on the unrecorded 
proceedings of the earlier ones''." 
THE MARTYR LOUSE ! 
339. Out of the proceeds obtained by selling the 
confiscated property of the offender who committed the 
'atrocious crime' of cracking the said louse was built a big: 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 139 
temple'8 worth lacs of rupees and it was named 'Yukvihar'— 
the temple of the Louse ! 
340. Were this incident described by any other writer 
it would have been as a parody of the Jain faith. But it is 
the Jain writers'' themselves who cite it with evident pride. 
Hence it has to be taken as true. 
341. What a paradoxical practice ! In order to save a 
louse in the hair of a man to cut off the very head of that 
man ! And this is called 'Ahimsa' ! As if to kill a man is no 
'Himsa'—violence ! Man seems to have no life at all ! It is 
because of this 'Ahimsa', more ruthless and more violent than 
violence—'Himsa'—itself that millions of Indian hunters, 
fishermen seamen, gamekeepers, foresters and others who 
lived by hunting and fishing, lost their professions. 
342. When these millions of flesh-eaters jointly protes­ 
ted and demonstrated how they and their wives and children 
would starve to death and how this would spell violence of 
an enormously grave nature King Kumar Pal of Gujrath** 
most graciously issued another order that these millions of 
people, who have been carrying on violent professions ought 
to leave those professions themselves. However as per their 
demand, the state was to subsidize them for three years*^. 
343. But what after those three years ! Starvation 
could not be completely ruled out in the case of these 
unfortunate millions. For flesh and meat was their chief food 
which could be had almost for nothing. But because this 
intolerant 'Ahimsa' made flesh-eating punishable by death, 
this common mass of people was antagonized to the Buddhist 
faith. These millions of people shook off its tyrannical 
yoke, and sought refuge in the Vedic religion, which had 
now taken an all-embracing noble form, accepting a rela­ 
tively considerate Ahimsa which allowed concessions for 
particular time and place and persons, concentrating mainly 
on human welfare** ! 
140 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
UNTOUCHABILITY AGGRAVATED BY THE BUDDHIST 
RELIGION 
344. Even today not only common people and good 
many propagandists but even historians seem to be labouring 
under the delusion that the Buddhists did not recognize the 
principle of untouchability, and that no one was considered 
untouchable in the Buddhist regime*'. What is laid down in 
someone's religious texts is beside the point. What the actual 
practice was is the most pertinent thing. One unavoidable 
result of the violent way in which the Buddhists tried to 
establish the principle of 'Ahimsa', and of their declaring 
a n i m a l - h u n t i n g a n d flesh-eating p u n i s h a b l e b y d e a t h , o f 
their over-enthusiastic and relentless efforts to search out 
such offenders and give the harshest capital and other severe 
punishments, was that the practice of untouchability instead 
of being wiped out became still more firmly rooted, wide­ 
spread and most distressing**. The limited space at our 
disposal prevents any further discussion of it in these pages ; 
and of course it is needless ! An unimpeachable proof can be 
found, not in the Vedic nor in the Buddhist texts of the 
times, but in the account of the foreign-Chinese travellers 
who had espoused Buddhism and who had travelled all over 
India. They avow, "whichever caste or community—as for 
example the 'Chandals'—did not give up the violent profes­ 
sions and did not observe Ahimsa according to the Buddha 
faith, were banished from the towns as untouchables; they 
had to form colonies of their own outside the towns and cities 
like those of the lepers. If at all they had an occasion and 
were permitted to come to the town on some market-day 
these untouchables had to carry in one hand a stick, to the 
end of which was tied a child's rattle or a small drum which 
they had to beat while going along the road so that the 
people in the streets might see them and avoid every possible 
contact with them**." 
345. Those, who ignorantly or maliciously blame the 
Peshwas*® for the evil treatment given to the untouchables 
when they entered the town, should also criticize, equally 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 141 
vehemently and for the same offence Asoka, Shree Harsha 
and Buddhist kings, and all the Kshatriya kings right from 
Vikramaditya to the Rajput rulers, when they see this 
evidence. For this evil tradition of untouchability was not 
begun by the Peshwas for the first time but it had been pre­ 
valent even since the Vedic, the Buddhist and the Jain 
regimes; and in the Buddhist period especially instead of 
being weakened it was most scrupulously and mercilessly 
observed. Even the untouchables themselves treated those 
below their own ranks as equally or even more untouchable. 
Those of the untouchables who are still under the delusion, 
that the Buddhists gave no quarter to untouchability and 
so extol that sect, should do well to remember that the 
Chandals, the Mahars and other untouchables were far more 
miserable under the violently non-violent Buddhists than 
under the Vedic people who accepted the principle of Ahimsa 
with its limitations. The Buddhists, once again I should 
like to repeat, aggravated and not mitigated 'Untouch­ 
ability.' They should examine the validity of this statement 
in the light of the undisputed evidence cited here and then 
alone should they choose whatever is beneficial to them. 
346. They should remember that for the above reason 
the untouchables like the Chandals and others preferred the 
Vedic regimes, as more congenial, to the unrelenting and 
uncompromising Buddhist ones, and those thousands of them 
who in the past had voluntarily (or helplessly and under 
pressure) embraced Buddhism, now renounced it and declared 
their allegience to the Vedic religion. Thus even before the 
Muslims set foot in Sindh, followers of the Buddha had begun 
to diminish in numbers by millions throughout all ranks of 
society, right from the highest to the lowest, and because of its 
inherent weakness Buddhism had declined to such an extent 
that the Chinese Buddhist travellers, who had seen its sad 
plight with their own eyes, had been moved to write that the 
holy and once prosperous places like Buddha Gaya, Mrigadava 
Shravasti, Kushinagar, and the birth place of Lord Buddha 
Kapilvatsu, which had been sanctified by the actual resi- 142 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
dence of the Lord and which had been the place of piligri- 
mage for the world-wide Buddhist followers, had been sadly 
rendered desolate and were overgrown with wild and thick 
forests*'. 
347. Nevertheless, this moribund Buddhism was not 
altogether wiped out of India, before the advent of the 
Muslims. The Buddhists were more numerous in the north­ 
western frontier states like Sindh and Kamboj and even in 
Bengal in the east than in the rest of India*'. It is said that 
the modern state of Bihar derives its name from the fact 
that there once existed far too many Buddhist Viharas, 
stoopas and other 'Buddhaparasthas'*'. Since tbe Vedic 
states were prosperous everywhere, this Buddhist sect had 
no guts to carry on its traitorous activities or to enforce its 
religious rites and faith on non-Buddhists, whether it had 
the will to do so or not. And so long as they followed their 
religious faith harmlessly they, their organisations, their 
institutions, and their viharas were never interfered with in 
any way by the Vedic kings. That they enjoyed complete 
religious freedom is admitted by the Chinese travellers open- 
heartedly*". 
348. What then made these millions of Buddhists, living 
in the various states of India before the Muslim onrush, 
dwindle into non-existence thereafter ? 
349. Some time ago historians, and especially western 
historians, had a presumption that sometime in the past or 
at frequent intervals, the Vedic rulers must have massacred 
these Buddhists and destroyed them root and branch, or 
r e c o n v e r t e d t h e m t o H i n d u i s m f o r c i b l y . I n o r d e r t o find 
some credence to this theory of theirs, they examined the 
historical records of the times most scrupulously but even 
after taking into consideration a few trifling exceptions they 
could find no proof to establish any deliberate, pre-planned, 
or systematic attempt on the part of the Vedic rulers to 
annihilate the Buddhists completely. 
349-A. At last the more conscientious of these historians 
declared*!, honestly that this presumption of theirs was 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 143 
totally unfounded and the very idea of forcible extinction 
of the Buddhists at the hands of the Vedic people was 
basically wrong. 
360. Who then was responsible for this total ousting 
of the Buddhist faith from India ? The historians, foreign as 
well as native, do not seem to have found an answer to this 
pressing question, or they have at least, preferred to be silent 
on this point. 
351. THE THIRD CAUSE—CONFRONTATION WITH 
MUSLIMS. 
351-A. We have already briefly described in the forego­ 
ing pages how, in spite of their traitorous solicitations of the 
Muslims, these 'Buddhaprasthees'—the idol worshipping 
Buddhists who preached extreme non-violence,-were violently 
exterminated from Sindh** by the Muslim aggressors under 
Kasim, owing to their innate hatred for that sect. For the 
same reason, and in the very same manner the Muslims went 
on liquidating the Buddhist pockets of influence, as they 
advanced conquering province after province in India. With 
a sword in one hand and the Koran in the other, every Muslim 
military chief broke down, demolished and raised to the ground 
the Buddhist 'stoopas', 'Sangharams', 'Viharas', the idols of 
Buddha, pillars, everything belonging to or relating to the 
Buddhists*'. As most of the Buddhists showed, through 
fear of death, willingness to embrace Islam, they were all 
converted. Not a single Buddhist remained alive in the 
north-western provinces like Gandhar, Kamboj and others; 
everyone became a Muslim or was silenced by the victor's 
sword. On seeing Bakhtyar Khiljee march on Bihar several 
Buddhists took their religious books and fled to Tibet and 
China**. The rest were polluted and taken over into the 
Muslim fold. Some might have preferred to die rather to be 
Muslims but no one fought for life and religion ! Nowhere can 
one find evidence to say that some Indian Buddhist army or 
some Buddhist organization fought with the Muslim invaders 
any battle worth the name ! 
144 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
M A J O R I T Y O F M U S L I M S IN E A S T B E N G A L 
EXPLAINED 
352. The same is the ease with East Bengal where the 
majority of the population was Buddhist. With some 
honourable exceptions, the Buddhists there took to Islam en 
masse. In Delhi, where the Muslim Sultans and Emperors 
ruled for over five hundred years, the Vedic Hindus have all 
along been in a clear majority. The whole of the Uttar 
Pradesh—the northern India—right upto West Bengal— 
whether under the Muslim administration or the British or 
the present one—the Vedic Hindus have all along maintained 
their numerical superiority. For, even when the Muslims 
first came conquering, the Buddhists in these provinces were 
conspicuously few in number. It is only in East Bengal that 
the Hindus fell into minority. How ? Quite obviously ! 
This province had numerically more Buddhists than the 
Hindus and those numerous Buddhists became Muslims ! It is 
natural, therefore, that this province alone should become, 
since then, a Muslim-majority province**. 
353. Thus it is that the social extinction of the 
Buddhists in India, which came to pass all of a sudden, was 
the inevitable effect of the armed and ruthless might of the 
Muslim conquerors. The relentless and uncompromising 
Buddhist Ahimsa was done to death by the equally relentless 
and bigotted Muslim violence ! 
354. But what happened to the Buddhist cult and 
Lord Buddba himself in India in the end ? Just as a stream 
separated from the River Bhagirathi should flow separately 
some miles away and once again should leap as a tributory 
into the same Bhagirathi, the Buddhist cult born out of the 
Vedic Hinduism merged in the end in the same Hindu 
religion; and Lord Buddha himself was established as the 
tenth of the Godly Avatars and was Hinduized, 
THE NEGLECTED 300-YEARS OF HINDU VALOUR 
355-356. In most of the 'Histories of India', by foreign 
as well as by our own writers, and especially in the text- 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 146 
books of history for Indian schools the later Muslim invasions 
of India follow so thickly the one of Sindh in A.D. 711 by 
Mohammed Kasim, and the accounts of the subjugation of 
province after province of India are narrated so hastily, as in 
one breath, and the whole account is so cursorily given in a 
limited space of 20 or 25 pages that a common reader or a 
small pupil is quite likely to think that the Hindus offered 
practically no resistance worth the name, that the Muslims 
were never halted in their advance. After the conquest of 
Sindh, the Muslim victors mounted, as it were, a magic horse 
and went on conquering the whole of India and never, t i l l 
they reached Kanyakumari, did they alight from it. This is 
obviously childish ! 
THE INTERVENING PERIOD 
357. To avoid this misconception and to nullify the 
injustice done to the Hindu nation, a true historian, whose 
avowed duty is to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth, should effectively and proportionately describe 
the intervals between any two Muslim invasions and the 
heroic resistance, successful or otherwise, offered by the 
Hindus. After the fall of Sindh in A.D. 711 Hindu Kings 
most effectively checked the Muslim advance outside Sindh 
for more or less 300 years. But this Hindu heroism quite 
easily escapes the notice of the common reader, because in 
almost all the text-books of Indian History it is not so 
impressively mentioned. 
358. It is because we utter the words 'three hundred 
years' or three centuries within three seconds, that the 
enormous length of this intervening period quite escapes 
our notice, unless we are expressly told about it. We should 
therefore measure the period in question, by generations 
of people. Five generations make up 300 years ! The 
British rule over India, for instance seems too lengthy to the 
present generation. But measured in centuries it lasted only 
for one and a half. Compared with it, the Hindu valour in 
arresting the Muslim onslaught within the confines of Sindh 
146 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
for more or less 300 years assumes a greater historical 
significance. The same holds good with regard to the other 
intervening periods* 
359» One cannot say justifiably that the Muslim vigour 
or their ambition to conquer the world was on the wane. 
On the contrary, these both were at their full height during 
this period. During this very period of three hundred years 
these very Arabs had overrun and vanquished nation after 
nation*® right from B a g h d a d to the Mediterranean sea and 
thence along the north African coast straight to Gibraiter, 
whence they subjugated Portugal and Spain and knocked at 
the gates of southern Prance. The name Gibraiter itself 
testifies to the unrivalled Muslim conquest of the west. Job- 
al-Tarik, which means the straits conquered by the Muslim 
Commander Tarik, is tbe root of the modern corrupt form 
'Gibraiter'". 
359-A. At last in A.D. 732 the valiant King of France, 
Charles Martel, gave a mortal blow to the Muslim aggression 
and repelled them for ever*'. It is this monumental triumph 
of Charles Martel that saved the whole of Europe ! In their 
triumphant march the Muslims not only subdued the 
kingdoms in Western Asia and Northern Africa politically, 
but with the sharp edge of their sword they also forced them 
all to embrace Islam*'. Even Portugal and Spain were 
forcibly converted to Islamic faith. Their womenfolk, too, 
were abducted and violently defiled®'. But both these 
nations freed themselves from the Muslim yoke some centuries 
afterwards. How they did so, will be described a little later. 
Still the fact remains that the nations on the north coast of 
Africa are even today Muslims. 
360. Well, it is not that during the years A.D. 700 to 
1000 the Muslims did not try to march out of Sindh and 
attack the neighbouring Hindu States, with the same devilish 
bigotry. They did try to force themselves on through 
Sourashtra and Gandhar many times'^. But every time they 
were routed by the Hindus. 
361. At that time from the eastern boundary of Sindh 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 147 
to the northern most boundary of north India there was an 
unbroken chain of valiant Rajput Rajas which, like a moun­ 
tain range, very difficult, though not quite impossible to 
cross, kepts on resisting stoutly the Muslim onslaught**. 
•Consequently, in Sourashtra and in the north-west provinces 
the attacking Muslina armies were put to rout again and again 
by the staunch resistance of the Hindus®*. On the other hand 
the mighty Bappa Raval of Chitted once attacked Sindh and 
after driving the Muslims clean out, annexed it to his own 
Kingdom**. The Arabs did, no doubt, capture it once again, 
but ultimately the Sumra Rajputs firmly established their 
rule over Sindh**. 
362, If the fanatic Arabs could trample under the horses' 
hoofs the whole northern coast of Africa and two major 
nations of Europe, why could they not force their way out of 
Sindh ? Thus put in sharp contrast with contemporary history 
of the west, the heroism of the Hindus shines out all the 
more clearly and brightly®*. 
363. Why couldn't another Chandragupta Maurya or a 
Vikramaditya, channel out the whole of the Indian might 
and drive the Arabian Muslims back right into the heart of 
Arabia is a fact which disturbs us not a little. 
CHAPTER V n 
THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE MUSLIM ATROCITIES [ SULTANS OF GHAZANI ] 
364. During the long period of nearly three hundred years in which the Arab menace was being successfully hemmed in Sindh, and was finally overthrown by the Sumra Rajputs, different Muslim tribes were busy founding a strong Muslim power in Ghazani further north of Gandhar^. A Sultan of Ghazani, Sabakhtageen, was now preparing himself fully to attack his contemporary Brahmin king, Jaipal, whose forefathers had all along been ruling the whole of Punjab and Gandhar right up to the Hindukush ever since the rout of the Huns*. 
366. Shrewdly anticipating the plan of Sabakhtageen to invade India Jaipal himself attacked Gazani*, but unfortunately he was repelled. Encouraged by this success Sabakhtageen boldly fell upon Jaipal, a few years afterwards, with a large army*. In order to meet this fierce aggression more determinedly. King Jaipal formed a powerful alliance *. with the neighbouring Hindu princes, but he was again defeated and the whole region beyond the Indus river, inclu­ ding Gandhar, was lost to the Muslim invader*. Soon after­ wards Sultan Sabakhtageen died and was succeeded by his son, Mohammed, a hundred times more fanatical and far crueller than his father and an arch-enemy of the Hindus. This was the same Mahmud of Ghazni who styled himself 'Butshikan', the Idol-braker or 'Iconoclast''. At his accession to the throne of Ghazni, he had vowed in the presence of the highest religious and temporal Muslim authority, the Grand Khalipha, that he would wipe out the Kafir Hindus from India*; and in order to keep his word he soon began a series of expeditions beyond the Indus. 
OTH GLORIOUS EPOCH 14:9 
366. It is from now onwards—i.e. about A . D . 1000— 
that the really great wars between the Hindus and the 
Muslims were to be fought for centuries together. 
367. If, the Muslim soldiers had gained great confidence, 
having twice defeated the Hindu forces under Jaipal, King 
Jaipal and his soldiers, without being disheartened and 
downcast even after suffering two defeats, speeded up their 
preparations for a still more determined stand against the 
Muslims. But fortune once again frowned upon the Hindu 
King; and when, notwithstanding all his valour and all his 
efforts to save his religion and his nation, he was again 
defeatad in 1001 by Mahmud of Ghazni, Jaipal preferred 
entrusting the Kingdon to his son, Anangpal, and burning 
himself to death in a great pyre to a disgraceful life and a 
meek surrender to the enemy*. 
368. King Anangpal, too, carried on his father's arduous 
task of staunchly opposing the Muslim aggression. In A.D. 
1006 Mahmud demanded passage through Anangpal's 
terrirtoy in order to invade Multan; but Anangpal refused to 
give any!", whereupon the Muslim aggressor marched on 
Anangpal and defeated him. Anangpal had to retreat and 
when Mahmud went ahead to Multan Anangpal again 
organized a united Hindu stand for protecting the Hindu 
religion. Once again tbe Hindu-Muslim armies met in the 
vicinity of the Indus, in A.D. 1008", when the Hindus 
fought so furiously that in the afternoon the Muslim 
formation was broken through and there was confusion 
in the Muslim ranks. Even Sultan Mahmud had prepared 
to leave the battlefield to make a retreat^*, when all of a 
sudden Anangpal's elephant, scared by the shower of burning 
arrows^*, turned round and started running amuck. This 
was the most unfortunate thing which had very often 
brought about the Hindu collapse, but no sufficient precaution 
was ever taken to prevent it. A great havoc was wrought 
by this retreating elephant among the Hindu ranks. 
Mahmud was quick enough to seize of the opportunity of this 
decisive turn of the battle and reorganizing the choicest of 
150 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY- 
his scattered soldiers he once again fell upon the bewildered 
Hindu army and in a deadly struggle defeated it. But the 
Muslim Prmy was no less worsted; so insbead of pursuing 
Anangpal, M a h m u d satisfied himself with the success he got 
and returned to Ghazni. But as it became quite clear to him 
that unless and until Anangpal was humbled completely no- 
Muslim power could be established in the Punjab, he assailed 
the latter for the third time^*. This time unfortunately, 
Anangpal had nobody to help him. Yet he went to war 
with the remnant of his loyal army and as a brave King 
that he was, he died in the thick of the fray. 
369. Thus King Jaipal and his son Anangpal and 
thousands of their brave soldiers boldly faced, and fought 
against the early ferocious Muslim onslaughts in the Punjab 
and laid down their lives for the protection of the Hindu 
state and the Hindu Religion. They did their sacred duty 
of arresting the enemy thrust. 
370. Soon after the death of Anangpal Mahmud annexed 
the Punjab to his kingdom of Ghazni^* as he had formerly 
done with the north-west frontier province. Sultan Mahmud 
then marched on Thaneshwar and Mathura, the most 
renowned of the holy places of the Hindus; and after 
demolishing and burning as many of the Hindu temples, and 
killing as many of the Hindu male population as possible and 
violating the chastity of hundreds of Hindu women and 
abducting them^®, Mahinud like a ferocious wolf returned to 
his den, Ghazni ! He also took with him immeasurable booty 
of gold and jewellery". In A.D. 1019 he pounced on the 
Pratihari capital of Kanouj and destroyed it i n the same 
brutal fashion^'. The result was that the surrounding Hindu 
population took such a fearful fright for him that when in 
A.D. 1023 he once again paid his sinister visit to Gwalior 
and Kalinjar, the princes there helplessly and meekly 
accepted his overlordship". 
HIS DASH ON SOMNATH 
371. Next, when in A.D.1026, Sultan Mahmud assailed. 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 151 
the famous temple of Somnath in Sourashtra, he did it with 
such a huge army*" and with such terrible vows and declaran 
tions that Raja Bheem of Sourashtra and Gujrath fled away*^ 
leaving the kingdom exposed to every sort of humiliation 
and destruction at the hands of this appalling enemy, tainting 
his own name of Bheem with everlasting shame. Naturally 
the Hindus had no army left, sufficiently well-equipped and 
well-organized to face this formidable Muslim assault. 
Nevertheless even at this critical time the priests of the 
Temple of Somnath offered to shoulder the responsibility of 
protecting the sacred temple as best as they could. They 
called upon the surrounding Hindu population to run to 
their aid in the sacred cause of defending the temple and 
their religion, and thousands of Hindus from far off regions 
also, answered their call and ran to the rescue of tbe Temple 
of Somnath. The battle was to be fought not for any ruler or 
king; no Hindu soldier was to individually profit by it. It 
was a crusade, pure and simple ! Moreover these thousands of 
Hindu soldiers were not a trained and well formed army. It 
was a conglomeration of Hindu crusaders that was collected 
at the eleventh hour. Even then they fought ferociously and 
desperately for tbe sacred cause without intermission or 
relaxation, by day and even by night, with the well-organized 
and stalwart Muslim soldiers ! While the Muslim army climbed 
right upto the ramparts and barricades over the high walls 
of the temple and even after it forced itself into the very 
temple, the toughest of Hindu resistance continued unmiti­ 
gated**. Muslim blood, too, was shed profusely**. Not before 
did Sultan Mahmud completely put down all resistence, could 
he ever force his way right into the innermost chamber of 
the temple and break the idol of Somnath with his own 
hands**. In order to celebrate this fanatical act he took for 
himself the title, 'Butshikan'—Iconoclast** ! 
MARTYRDOM OF FIFTY THOUSAND BRAVE 
HINDU SOLDIERS 
372. Even Muslim historians** write that at least fifty 152 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
thousand Hindus fell fighting in the defence of their temple. 
Had someone of these fifty thousand Hindus said, "I am 
willing to be a Muslim," he would have been spared by the 
Muslims, because it was one of their tactics in the religious 
war. But scorning such a base and defiled life the Hindu 
volunteer force courted martyrdom; not one, not even a 
thousand, but fifty thousand of them sacrificed their precious 
lives on the altar this holy battle ! 
373. While eulogizing an ancient Roman hero, Horatius 
who fought with the enemy on a similar occasion, an English 
poet writes : 
Thus outspake brave Horatius 
the Captain of the gate, 
"To every man upon this earth 
death cometh soon or late. 
And how can a man die better than 
by facing fearful odds 
For the ashes of his fathers and 
the temples of his Gods 
374. Which Hindu will be reluctant to shed his grateful 
tears for these fifty thousand martyrs, who died defending 
their religion and temples with the same fervour as is 
expressed in this verse ? 
375. But the fact most disgusting is that while narrating 
this invasion of Mahmud on Somnath, not only the foreign his­ 
torians but many Hindu historians, ungrateful as they too are, 
have mocked at the simple faith of the priesthood and other 
Hindu population of the place, and have not uttered a single 
word in praise of those Hindu warriors who made such a huge 
sacrifice, 'facing fearful odds ! for 'the temples of their Gods' ! 
If the wiseacres are not wise-enough to appraise the jewels 
properly, can it be said that the fault lies with those jewels! 
376. Even if it be necessary to condemn the blind faith 
of those Hindus, yet those who do so should also remember 
that, albeit blind, the Hindu belief in the mysterious divine 
power of their Gods was not a diabolic, fanatic, bloodthirsty 
religiocity like that of the Muslims who attacked religious 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 153 
places of others with deadly weapons of war, slew the 
innocent men and women, young and old, forced them to 
embrace Islam at the point of the sword, and ran frantically 
•causing death and destruction everywhere. But such a state­ 
ment born of boldnes cannot be expected of these immature 
•childish and cowardly writers ! If the Muslim writers of 
'Tarikhs'28 and the Mulla Moulavees boast that the Hindu 
•Gods were not the true Gods because they did not prevent 
the Muslim war-lords from breaking idols and demolishing 
temples, and that theirs was the only true religion, they 
should be enlightened that the arch heretic Changizkhan and 
Iiis deputies not only desecrated the very city of the Muslim- 
Ji^halipha, but ravaged it, killed the Khalipha, burned several 
Masjids where Muslim Gods were said to reside, turned others 
into stables for their horses, reduced the Bible to ashes, and 
trampled the Koran under their horses' hoofs*'! The Muslim 
Allah could not stop the ravaging hands of Changizkhan ! 
Hundreds of such instances can be cited*'. Are the Muslims 
:ready to grant, on this account, the imbelicity and falsehood 
•of their Allah ? Even when Shivaji slew the 'Butshikan'— 
idol-breaker—Afzalkhan and offered his 'goat-like head with 
thirty-two teeth', as a sacrificial offering to the Goddess 
Bhavani of Tulzapur'^, his hands were not staved off from 
doing so by the Muslim Allah ! 
377. After demolishing the temple of Somnath and 
loading the camels with the immense wealth, looted from it, 
when Mahmud set out for Ghazni, he learnt that, instead 
•of being cowed down into submission because of his whole­ 
sale destruction of the temple at Somnath, the Hindu popu­ 
lation was even more enraged, and that the King of Malava 
with his large army was preparing to block his way back to 
Ghazni and had already entered the battlefield. As Mahmud 
was not prepared to risk this new battle, he took an unexpec­ 
ted and difficult route through the sandy deserts of Sindh 
abandoning the usual way through Malava**. While crossing 
the deserts of Sindh and Baluchistan, his army had to face 
many dangers and unspeakable misery**. Hardly within 
154 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
three or four years of reaching Ghazni he died in A.D. 1030**. 
378. This fanatic but brave Sultan of Ghazni undertook 
a t l e a s t fifteen m a j o r e x p e d i t i o n s t o I n d i a . H i n d u s t o o 
fought furiously on the battle-field every time. But no 
Hindu king could defeat him. But these invasions of Mahmud 
and his political conquests did not so much harm the Hindus, 
as did the forcible conversion of millions of Hindus in North- 
West Frontier Province and the Punjab. That the kingdoms 
which were lost to the Muslims were reconquered by the 
Hindus sooner or later, is plain history. But the Hindus could 
never bring back the millions of Hinuswho were converted to 
Islam willy-nilly. We could free from the foreign yoke our 
geographical regions but the enormous numerical loss of 
population could never be made up by the Hindu nation. 
CHANGE OF RELIGION MEANS CHANGE OF 
NATIONALITt 
379. We are now going to discuss at some length some 
of the religious concepts of the Hindus of those times ; of the 
course of conduct and practices that were considered decent 
and in conformity with the religious laws of the Hindus of 
those times and those that were declared to be against them; 
and particularly those which deeply concerned the large-scale 
forcible defilement and conversion of the Hindus that took 
place during the Hindu-Muslim war. It can be very briefly 
said here that if the millions of forcibly converted Hindus, 
have remained Muslims even to this day it is because of the 
perverse religious concepts of the Hindus of those times, 
which ultimately proved highly detrimental to the best 
interests of the Hindu community, viz., caste-system, the 
fantastic ideas of pollution, the extravagant ideas o f 
religious tolerance and many other silly notions ! Why, these 
Hindu converts went on increasing enormously generation 
after generation and, as the later generations were born and 
brought up under the Muslim influence, they began to be 
more and more fanatical—so bitterly fanatical that they- 
formed an appreciable part of the armies of the Iranian, 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 155 
Turkish, Mongol and other foreign Muslim invaders and, with 
equal hatred and bitterness, they attacked the Hindu Kafirs 
with a view to destroying them completely or force them to 
change their own religion and embrace Islam**. One out of 
hundreds of such facts can be cited here to bear out the above 
remarks. A Hindu tribe, named Ghuri** which lived, during 
the period under discussion, beyond the Indus and which was 
forcibly made to change over to Islam under precisely the 
same perilous conditions, became later on the bitterest enemy 
of the Hindus. The Hindu-hater, Sultan Mohammed Ghori, 
belonged to this very Ghuri tribe. In fact the majority of 
the Muslim populations of Afghanisthan, Pathanisthan 
(Pakhtoonistan), Balluchistan were the converted descen­ 
dants of the original Hindu natives of those places*'. But 
later on they did not even have the slightest idea that their 
ancestors were, once upon a time, Hindus. On the contrary 
they were enraged at any mention of such descent of theirs. 
'Bygones are bygones; to-day we are born Muslims and are 
Muslim nationals. We recognize no other relation with the 
Hindus than the one of utmost hatred and animosity'. Such 
thoughts had turned their heads completely. Theirs was not 
merely a change of religion, but it was the inevitable change 
of nationality which necessarily forced itself upon the later 
generations of such converts. During the five or six centuries 
of the initial Muslim invasions of India right upto Ramesh- 
war, to which we are referring here, the change of religion 
to-day generally proved to be the change of nationality for 
the future ! 
BUT WHAT DOES RELIGION MEAN HERE ? 
380. But the terms 'religion' and 'religious conversion' 
in the above maxim, viz. 'the change of religion means the 
change of nationality', should first be defined clearly. They 
are not used here in the sense of comparative study of the 
various philosophical ideas and systems in differert religions 
or the adoption of some of the agreeable ones in an individual 
capacity. The word 'religion' in the present context refers 
156 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
solely to the dogmatic and fanatical practices of those 
aggressive religious institutions which insist that a particular 
•book is apocalyptic, that whatever is told in its pages—and 
that alone and nothing else—is truly religious, that every­ 
thing else is completely false and sinful. It then tries to 
enforce on people of other religions the strict observance, if 
not by advice and peaceful discourse and persuasion, 
•even by skilful craftiness, cruelty and coercion, of not only 
the so-called philosophy in those religious books but of the 
rules and regulations, of rites and rituals, of the language 
and social dealings prescribed by them. The religious conver­ 
sion effected by such thoughtless and fanatical religious 
institutions is in effect the conversion of nationality. 
RETALIATORY WEAPON OF OSTRACISM 
381. The Hindus could find no retaliatory weapon for 
this religious aggression of the Muslims. The weapon of 
•ostracism, which they used for retaliaton, turned on them­ 
selves like a boomerang. 
382. In order that the reader should have a clear idea; 
of this weapon of social ostracism, so far as it concerns the 
Hindu-Muslim war and how it affected, not favourably, but 
adversely the defence of the Hindu religion and Hindu 
community, it is essential to give first of all an account of 
the caste-system as briefly as it is possible to do so. Since 
such an account is absolutely essential for an analysis of the 
Muslim pollution of the Hindus. 
THE CASTE-SYSTEM BASED ON BIRTH AND 
PARENTAGE AND THE NATIONAL 
PENALTY OF OSTRACISM 
383. Much earlier than the Muslim invasions of India, 
i.e.,had just after the Hindus conquered the Huns completely, 
hundreds of Hindu leaders tried on all sides all over India to 
restore political, religious and social stability in the 
society and the nation. Tbe Hindu leadership of the time 
naturally devolved on the then rising warrior class of the 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 157 
Kajput*' royalty who were staunch devotees oftheVedie 
Hindu religion. In this very attempt at reconstruction, the 
vast Hindu community was being moulded with meticulous 
care into the framework of the parentage-dominated caste- 
system*'. Slowly but surely, this caste system became an 
inherent and essential feature of Hinduism. Not only in the 
four former classes (^s) but in more or less four thousand 
castes, born out of those four classes and many other acciden­ 
tal sources, sanctioned by the religious law, was the whole 
Hindu community everlastingly and almost unanimously 
divided internally. In a sense, the social transition of the 
Hindu nation was occasioned by the historical necessity of 
the time. 
384. The main principle underlying this caste-system was 
this : Only he who was born in a particular caste, could remain 
in it*'. To have food or to drink even water with or from one 
of another caste was considered liable for penalty. Is it 
any wonder then that the inter-caste marriages of boys and 
girls were strictly prohibited ? To these very religious 
practices of the time we have ascribed, in our various articles 
on the caste-system*!, the names 'Lotibandi (prohibition of 
drinking water), Rotibandi (prohibition of food), Betibandi 
(prevention of inter-caste marriages), Sparshbandi (Untouch­ 
ability) and the ones which we are going to discuss hereafter 
viz., Shuddhibandi (prevention of purification of religious 
converts), Sindhubandi (ban on sea voyage), etc. These seven 
'bandis'—or bans—which arrested not only the progress of 
the Hindus but also impaired their normal way of life were 
in fact seven fetters. These fetters were not forcibly fastened 
to the feet of the Hindu nation by any Muslim, Christian or 
other foreign power ; they were so fastened by the Hindus 
themselves, in their extreme anxiety for the protection of 
their religion. That is why we have been calling them through 
spoken as well written words not foreign shackles, but as 
'seven native fetters', 
385. It is not necessary here in this book to discuss 
fully the caste-system of the Hindus, nor is this the place for 
158 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
it. Those desirous of getting themselves acquainted with our 
thoughts on this subject may profitably read the book, 
'Janmajat Jatyutchhedak Nibandha" (The Eradication of the 
Parentage-dominated caste-system). Here, while describing 
the religious aggression of our foreign enemies, we shall 
discuss it only so far as it is absolutely necessary to do so. 
386. First of all it should not be forgotten that this 
caste-system must have facilitated the stupendous consolidar 
tion and remarkable stability of the Hindu Society under 
certain peculiar circumstances and in particular contexts. 
In evaluating it, it would be ungrateful only to point to the 
eventual harm that it has caused in its later stages. 
387. It must also be admitted that the Hindus of those 
times created, or voluntarily allowed to be created, this 
caste-system with the sole object of protecting their racial 
seed and blood, preserving their caste-life and tradition and 
keeping them absolutely pure from any contamination. 
388. The structure of the caste-system was based on 
the principles of heredity, of the economy based on the 
division of labour, of social co-existence and of social ethics, 
so far as these principles were comprehended by the writers 
of different 'Smritis'**. Thousands of years have rolled by; 
the Hindu nation has faced innumerable calamities add 
catastrophes; yet the hold of the caste-system and the 
influence that it has wielded upon billions and billions of 
Hindus throughout these tens of centuries could never have 
been possible, if the roots of this birth-dominated caste-system 
had not gone deeper into the very foundation of this colossal 
edifice of the Hindu society. The Hindu faith—that the 
religious duties prescribed for the particular castes and sub- 
castes like Pariyas, Bhangis, Kolis, Bhils were the pious ways 
of attaining their earthly welfare and heavenly bliss and Godly 
grace for them—would never have otherwise remained so 
steadfast through all these perilous centuries. Again, if the 
life-blood which ran through the veins of Hindu society, appa­ 
rently most heterogenous and miserably disorganised, had 
not animated its diversified elements with some undying and 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 159 
unifying force with a certain consciousness of its true self*^. 
388-A. This powerful unifying national sentiment which 
so unmistakably held together these different and apparently 
autonomous elements of the Hindu society and fused them 
together was ; 
Hindutwa ! And Hindudharma. 
389. What we should like to call to-day the seven 
native shackles [viz. Untouchability (?q^^^) ban on dining 
together of the people belonging to different castes (^'^c'^), 
ban on inter-caste marriages and so on] did never 
appear to be shackles or fetters to the Hindus of those times, 
when the Muslims had begun invading India. To them they 
were but the charmed amulets or protecting bands ! Every 
caste, whether of the Brahmins or of the sweepers was 
immensely proud of its separate entity. 
390. These various castes and sub-castes of the Hindus 
punished even the slightest violation of the caste-laws with 
social ostracism**—even if such a violation of caste-law was 
voluntary or involuntary, knowingly or unknowingly ! 
391. Today we are apt to take this social ostracism 
quite lightly: but at the time of Muslim aggressions and 
thereafter, the very mention of such social ostracism would 
have unfailingly shocked to death every Hindu—whether he 
was a prince or a pauper : To be cut off from one's own caste 
was to be cut off from the whole world and from life itself. 
So severe was this punishment of social boycott that the 
unfortunate person at once lost his parents and brothers, 
his kith and kin^—the people of his own flesh and blood—and 
was thrown into abysmal gloom. It should be sufficient to say 
here briefly that this social ostracism was far more dreaded 
than any physical torture or a heavy fine involving any 
financial loss or even death. Consequently the tendency to 
observe scrupulously, and in strict conformity with the 
prevalent social practices, the traditional caste-laws, sanc­ 
tioned by the sacred religious books and the writers of the 
various Smritis, was ingrained into the very texture of the 
Hindu society for generations together*^. 
160 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
392. Although we can gratefully cite many other things 
regarding the caste-system which brought about the cohesive- 
ness of the diversified Hindu society and had lasting effects 
on it, it would be equally ungrateful on our part if we desist 
from criticising with sufficient severity the unlimited harm 
done by this caste-system and the irrational and obstinate 
pride that the Hindus took in it, when the Muslims began to 
knock at their doors. 
393. As a means of beating down the religious aggression 
of the Muslims, this counter-stroke of the Hindu caste 
system proved to be most ineffectual and useless like a 
blunted sword. On the contrary these very caste-laws and 
the strict adherence to them brought about a series of 
disasters on the Hindu religion and the Hindu nation, making 
the conversion of the millions of Hindus far too easier for 
the Muslims than can be imagined, while it cannot be denied 
that they made the conversion of the Muslims to Hinduism, 
absolutely impossible. 
394. Before they came to India, the Arabians and other 
Muslims forced the millions of Christian, Jewish, and Persian 
populations of Iran, Turan, the kingdoms of the middle 
Asia and Africa, right from Egypc to Spain, to give up their 
own religious faiths and accept Islam at the point of the 
sword. But these various European and Afro-Asian people 
never for a moment thought themselves to be polluted, nor 
that their own original religion was lost to them simply 
because they took food or drink with the Muslims. The 
Muslim rulers had to keep their swords constantly hanging 
over their heads to enforce their allegiance to Islam, and to 
ensure from them the strict observance of the Muslim 
religious rites and duties, for centuries together. If by 
chance the Muslim power at any place was uprooted and 
completely effaced the forcibley converted Christians or 
Persians and others went over to their original religions 
en masse, throwing away to the winds the green Muslim shred 
of a flag and proudly fluttering their own in its stead. As 
such it was very difficult for even the Muslim powers there 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 16* 
to keep these unwilling converts tied to the Islamic faith, 
the Muslim armed soldiers had to keep a vigilant eye on 
these foreign converts and to see every time if their faith in 
Islam was shaken even a bit or whether they did not foment 
any agitation to go back to their own religion**. 
395-396. Gn the contrary in Spain, Greece, Serbia and 
other countries where the Muslims in their turn were forced 
to forsake Islam and court Christianity or on the pain of 
death, the Christian rulers there had to keep a similar strict 
watch on these Muslim converts. For the Muslims, too, never 
thought that they were anyway defiled because of any food 
they ate from the Christians or because they had marital or 
extramarital relations with them. These forcibly converted 
Muslims were on the alert to see if the ruling power became 
weak at any place and immediately revolted, hoisting any 
green cloth that they could catch hold of as their flag and 
re-entered the Muslim fold*'. They would even compel, if 
possible, the Christians themselves to accept Islam, and 
thus avenge the wrong done to them. This experience 
else where made the early Arabian and other Muslim invaders 
of India fear at least for a century or two that they would 
be obliged to use military force alone to keep the newly 
converted Hindus tied down to the Islamic faith. 
397-398. But when they invaded Sindh and forced 
conversion to the Islamic faith on the people there, these 
Muslim invaders came to realize soon enough that although 
the Hindus' pride for their religion and their loyalty to it 
was no less ardent than that of any other people, and at 
times it was far more fervent and irrepressible than that of 
all of them,—why, for this very reason,—it was very easy 
for the Muslims and others to enforce physical conversion on 
the Hindus, if, however, mental conversion was far too 
difScult. 
399. This did not merely pertain to the time when the 
Muslims invaded India. Even before the rise of Islam, the 
Syrian Christians, who were very generously—in other words 
suicidally—given shelter by the Hindu kings in the Malabar*^ i62 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
and who began to proselytize the Hindu community,—also 
came to know very soon that it was quite possible to 
desecrate a whole village of Caste Hindus by merely thrusting 
a morsel of grub into their mouths or by just throwing 
crumbs of half-eaten loaves of bread or biscuits or slices of 
beef or the meat of cows into wells and tanks where people 
went to have drinking water; and that no one of them had 
any place in the Hindu community any longer**. 
400. Later on, when in the 15th and the 16th centuries 
the European armies of the Portuguese and others rushed 
into India by the sea-routes they, too,- were pleased to find 
the above-mentioned superstitions of contamination and the 
absurd religiosity of the Hindus, and were fired with an evil 
ambition to proselytize the whole of India with no difficulty 
at all. 
FETTERS FOR THE MISERABLE HINDU 
PROSELYIES 
401-402. The Hindu armoury has all along been full of 
invincible weapons to beat back the political aggressions of 
the foreigners, and they had successfully crushed down such 
attempts on various occasions. But it had, at least in those 
times, no weapon to fight back this religious aggression. So 
the Indians had to rely on this sole weapon of social boycott, 
while facing this unprecedented Muslim religious aggression of 
polluting and converting the Hindus. They went on relentlessly 
with their policy of completely ostracizing every proselyte 
Hindu according to the custom of those days. The then 
Hindu Society had kept no way open to purify a convert by 
some form of atonement for the sin of contamination and 
conversion. Although, by the time of the Muslim advance 
upto the Punjab, the number of Hindu converts to Islam had 
already mounted to hundreds of thousands"" and although 
many of them earnestly wished to come back to Hinduism, 
this social ostracism of the converts was so very persistent 
with the ban on eating food from persons of another caste, 
the ban on intercaste marital relations and the otherSj that 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH : 163 
it was at once accepted by the leaders of the Hindu Society 
without any thought aboub the consequences. Naturally 
-this ban on the repurification and adoption of the converts 
back to Hinduism also automatically grew into a new fetter 
and, instead of checking the, foreign religious aggression, it 
hampered the progress of Hinduism itself. 
BAN OF OSTRACISM AND SELF-SEEKING 
CONVERTS 
403. Well, it would have been quite proper and necessary 
to ostracize those opportunists among the Hindus who had 
•taken to Islam for their selfish ends, for power, or for 
^avenging their private grudge against their own fellow-men; 
for they had willingly severed all connections with Hindu 
people, and no good could be served by readmitting these 
sinful people into the Hindu Society. But what if they should 
later on sincerely repent for this sinful act of theirs ! This 
irrevocable ban did immeasurable wrong to those unfortunate 
tens and hundreds of thousands who, fearing social boycott, 
would never have dreamt of going over to Islam but who were 
absolutely unable and helpless to face the atrocities of the 
Muslim onslaught. For these miserable and forlorn thousands 
^nd for their offsprings at least there should have been some 
hope of redemption ! 
404. Again, the self-seeking opportunists who willingly 
went over to Islam were much too limited in number. Precisely 
for this very reason it seems extremely tragic that this 
punitive measure of ostracism fell like a bolt from the blue 
on the helpless victims of the avalanche-like Muslim religious 
aggression : doing not the least harm to the real perpetrators 
•of the crime. As it were it was insult added to injury. They 
were already wriggling with excruciating agony at the loss of 
their religion and M^ere, even prepared to court death by way 
atonement and yet they were irretrievably condemned to 
permanent damnation, were never again to be received by 
their own parents, their husbands and sons and all their 
relatives, as their own, The very flesh of their flesh and the 
164 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
blood of their blood, were now complete strangers to them, at rleast in this world ! 
A STRANGE JUSTICE 
405. While thus mercilessly penalising these innocent 
victims, the Hindus could not only do no harm to the 
malevolent and atrocious Muslim invaders with their counter- 
stroke of ostracism, but on the contrary helped them directly 
and enormously in their work of proselytization ! 
406-407. Unlike the armed vigilance that was necessary 
for hundreds of years to keep the converted Christians, Jews 
and other peoples of the west, tied down to the Muslim faith, 
the work of proselytization in India necessitated only a day's 
labour for the Muslims. If once at the time of a battle or an 
armed aggression on cities and villages they took the trouble 
of defiling the thousands of men and women either by food, 
drink or rape or mere association, the responsibility of keeping 
them in the Muslim fold for generations together was 
shouldered by the Hindus as if it was a religious duty of their 
own ! Thus worked the punitive measure of ostracism, serving 
the best interests of the enemy whom it sought to counteract. 
408. But the conversion of one Hindu to the Islamic 
faith meant the transformation of a man into a demon, the 
metamorphosis of a God into a Satan ! This was the unplea­ 
sant reality of the cataclysraal Hindu-Muslim wars ! How 
this demonization of the Hindus took place is briefly shown 
in paragraphs 379 & 380. 
409. Even then the Hindu society turned a deaf ear and 
blind eye to this reality ! To speak broadly, it can be safely, 
said that the Muslims had never to worry about the converts 
ever going back to their own religion, for they were convinced 
that the Hindus would never accept them ! 
410. The Hindus j'could never clearly distinguish the 
change of caste from the change of religion. 
411. For instance, if a Vaishya had an illicit exchange 
of food or matrimonial relations with one of a lower Hindu 
caste, say a Shimpi (a tailor), a Bhandari (a brewer), or some- 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 166 
one else^ he was excommunicated from his caste. Similarly 
if a Hindu had perforce to take food, or drink water with a 
sinful (in their opinion) non-Hindu or if he or his wife was 
defiled or raped, and so had to live with the Muslims, he was 
banished not only by his own caste but even by the lowliest 
caste of the Hindus. It means the casting out of a Hindu 
from one caste, for having the so-called illicit relations with 
another, was considered on a par with the casting out of 
another from the whole of the Hindu society for similar 
reason ! The fundamental national difference between the 
two which in the long run was to affect, adversely and 
horribly, the numerical superiority of the Hindus, altogether 
escaped their notice. 
412. An exile from any one caste of the Hindus never 
lost his Hindu society nor his Hindu religion; he could merge 
in any one of the many other Hindu castes or could form a 
new caste of similar outcastes. But this new caste of such 
outcastes formed an integral part of the Hindu society. There 
was a change of caste but never a change of religion—nor even 
a change of society. Why then speak of a change of nation­ 
ality ? The above-mentioned Vaishya, for instance, lost his 
Vaishya caste, but his being a Hindu remained unimpaired^^. 
Naturally this sort of banishment from one caste to the other 
in the Hindu society never caused any numerical loss to it. 
413. But when, according to the same custom, a Hindu 
banished because of some sort of (so-called) illicit contact 
with any Muslim, he would cease to be a Hindu altogether, 
as thousands of such Hindu men and women were, often 
enough, being converted under coercion by the Muslim aggres­ 
sors, and as they were all, without any exception, thrown 
out of the Hindu society, it was the Hindu society which 
suffered huge numerical losses year after year ! 
414. Only one extract from the many 'Tava,rikhs' 
(histories) written by various Muslim writers should serve as 
a sample to show how miserable the Hindu converts were ! 
415-417. Of the hundreds of Hindus taken as slaves and 
sent to Persia, Turan (Turkey) and Arabia, at the time of the 
166 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
invasions of Mahmud Ghazni, some could give J;he slip, 
individually or in groups and would run away to the Punjab, 
which because of the staunch Hindu resistance remained the 
extreme limit of Muslim domination for over a century or so 
after Mahmud Ghazni. Thereafter these runaway Hindu 
converts would escape even from the Punjab and enter the 
neighbouring Hindu states of Rajputana for shelter, and were 
glad at heart that they were at last free from the Muslim 
clutches and that they would live happily in Hindu families, 
in their own temples and in their own society ! 
418. But alas ! they were grossly disappointed because 
of the ban on reconversion and rehabilitation of these 
cast-outs ! These groups of runaway H i n d u converts would 
come to these Hindu states only to find that not only their 
own, but no other Hindu state was prepared to accept them 
in their fold. If at all they wished [to live in the Hindu 
states, these men and women, of the runaway shelter-seeking 
groups, had to live as Muslims alone ! Later on, when, after 
a century or so, the Muslim armies began to make successful 
expeditions upto Delhi and central India they were very 
much surprised to see these people still living in these Hindu 
states as Muslims ! If any such group or community of the 
Hindus were found to be existing in the Muslim states it 
could never have been allowed to live as a Hindu community 
any longer ! For, by force or by craft it would have been 
converted to Islam. This was the experience of the Muslims t 
This was the Muslim religion ! 
419. Here, however, in Hindu states the Hindus who 
were converted much against their will and who were willing 
to come back to the Hindu society had to live as none else 
but the Muslims, because of the ban on their reorientation t 
This was the Hindu Religion** ! 
420. What wonder then if in an unequal war the Muslims 
defiled, with craft or coercion, millions of Hindus and thus 
inflicted immeasurable numerical loss to the Hindu nation ! 
The greatest wonder, however, is how this loss was 
limited to this much alone ! 
CHAPTER VIII 
PERVERTED CONCEPTION OF VIRTUES 
421-422. Besides the silly superstitions of the Hindus about the caste-system, the various bans on exchange of food and drink, redemption of the outcastes and others, of which we have already written fully, and which had done tremendously more harm than the two-pronged religio-political Muslim offensive had done, another suicidal morbidity had completely possessed the Hindu mind for a long time. This morbidity paralysed their own offensive and counter-offensive might. Ear greater than the Muslims could ever attempt were the defeats inflicted on themselves by these morbidly virtuous Hindus ! If a comparatively mild term is to be used for this infatuation—^^this mental imbalance of the Hindus, which caused disastrous losses for themselves—we have to call it a perverted sense of Hindu virtues. 
423. In fact virtues or vices are only relative terms. No virtue can be unqualified and absolute under every circumstace or at every place. Be it said briefly that in practice or in ethical code a virtue should be called a virtue only to the extent to which it is useful to the best interests of human society. And the moment it begins to cause harm to mankind, it should be considered a vice and as such discarded forthwith. 
424. Some qualities at least are divided into three parts : Satwik (mild, gentle). Rajas (Passionate) and Tamas (irascible, irritable}; and even these should be viewed with reference to the peculiar condition of time, place and person. The Hindu civilization had the noblest ambition of raising Man to the status of God and as such it went in for an all- out attempt to inculcate and cultivate with assiduous care, these gentle qualities in him. But this worldly existence is 
168 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
not woven with one thread alone; its texture shows at least 
three different threads; the gentle, the passionate and the 
irritable^. It is precisely for this reason that if a man, 
whosoever he may be, wishes to live in this world, wants to 
win or at least does not intend to be vanquished by others, 
or does not want to see injustice triumph over him, he must 
have a three-edged weapon which could successfully face 
these three-fold (qualities. But at this time of the Hindu- 
Muslim war the Hindu nation forgot even the Bhagwat Geeta 
which preached the relative, and, not absolute, values of 
these virtues. Why, they even twisted the message of the 
Bhagwad Geeta itself. The quintessence of the Bhagwat 
Geeta is the consideration of the fine distinction between 
man and man—of which the Hindus of those times seem to 
be divinely oblivious. 
425. Of course, it must be remembered that all this 
argument applies generally and collectively to the Hindu 
polity made up of hundreds of millions of people, but it must 
also be remembered that there were to come to life, from time 
to time, thousands of exceptional groups of men and brave 
societies of dauntless people who opposed this perversely 
virtuous Hindu society in order to bring about a social 
revolution. They will be referred to in their proper places. 
426-427. To let go the vanquished and abjectly 
surrendering enemy is said to be a virtue* in some religious 
books; so enemies like the ingratitudfe and ungrateful 
Mohammed Ghori and the Rohila Najibkhan, were set free*. 
And what did they do in return for this noble act of the 
Hindus ? The first brutally murdered his former benefactor, 
Prithviraj Chauhan*, while the second conspired against the 
very Marathas*, who let him go alive, and brought about 
their unprecedented destruction at Panipat. Having only 
learnt by rote the maxim, to give food to the hungry and 
water to the thirsty is a virtue®, the Hindus went on giving 
milk to the vile poisonous cobras and vipers ! Even while the 
Muslim demons were demolishing Hindu temples and breaking 
to pieces their holiest of idols like Somnath, they never 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 169 
wrecked their vengeance upon those wicked Muslims, even 
when they had golden opportunities to do so, nor did they 
ever take out a single brick from the walls of Masjids, 
because their religious teachers and priests preached the 
virtue of not inflicting pain on the offender : 
'Never pay the tormentor in his own coin 
but bear the torments meekly and be patient 
that God will punish him' 
428. The vilest of vices recorded in the catalogues of 
the religious texts could never have been more detrimental 
to the welfare of mankind, more harmful to the national 
interests, and so more detestable than such virtues as give 
rise to horrible atrocities and the greatest of sins. Naturally 
whoever cultivates, and lives upto, such virtues thoughtlessly 
^nd foolishly and with slavish adherence to the religious 
texts, and also with fanatic obstinacy, is bound to perish 
individally and bring about disaster of the nation in which 
he lives. These qualities are not virtues; they are virtues 
•distorted in the extreme. Whichever virtue is adopted 
thoughtlessly and without regard to the time, place and 
person is corrupted and rotten, and, like putrefied food, 
iDecomes poisonous. 
429-430. Every Hindu seems to have been made to 
suck, along with his mother's milk, this Nectar-like advice 
that religious tolerance is a virtue'. But nobody ever 
•explains to him the essence of that precept. If that alien 
religion is also tolerant of our own religion, our tolerance 
towards it can be a virtue. But the Muslim and the Christian 
religions, which boldly proclaim it to be their religious duty 
to destroy most cruelly the Hindu religion and to eradicate 
from the face of this earth the kafirs and the heathens, can 
never be described as tolerant of other religions. In respect 
-of these intolerant foreign religions the very extremely 
enraged intolerance, which seeks to retaliate their abtrocities 
•with super-atrocious reprisals, itself becomes a virtue^ ! 
170 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
431. Even if we were to restrict our discussion to the 
period under discussion, it will be seen that every Muslim 
aggressor went on demolishing Hindu temples at Mathura 
and Kashi (Benaras)*. The most sacred idols in the various 
magnificent shrines from all over India right upto Ramesh- 
waram were not only purposely taken to the Muslim capitals 
like Delhi and plastered into the portal steps of their royal 
palaces, but, for the sole purpose of hurting the feelings of 
the Hindus and insulting them, they were also used as 
slabs and tiles for lavatories, water-closets, and urinals^". To 
be tolerant towards those Muslims who called these and 
many other atrocities their religious duty is the very negation 
of virtue, its sacrilegious perversion ! Nay, for the Hindus to 
show such tolerance was the greatest sin to be punished in 
Hell ! But the Hindus committed this very sin under the 
name of virtue ! Even after overthrowing the various Muslim 
powers, i.e. even when the Hindus had acquired political 
ascendancy, they did not destroy the various masjids at Kashi 
(Benares), Mathura or Rameshwaram nor used their ruins 
as tiles for the various building constructions along roads. 
At the most, the Hindus reconstructed and renovated their 
old temples which were raised to the ground by the Muslims.. 
They did nothing more ! On the contrary, there are astonish­ 
ing instances of grant of new lands for their maintenance and 
assurance of protection of the masjids which had been built by 
the Muslim aggressors, by the Hindu powers^!. In this con­ 
nection one stray instance can be cited to show confusion of 
the then Hindu thought. It affords a shameless exhibition of 
the perverted virtue of the Hindus which makes any further 
discussion in this regard absolutely unnecessary ! 
432-433. After Mahmud of Ghazni demolished the 
temple of Somnath for the first time, it was rebuilt several 
times by the Hindus and destroyed by the Muslim conquerors 
as many times ! Once when a powerful Hindu king^*' 
established his power in that region, he rebuilt it with all 
pomp and ceremony, and under his able guidance the land 
also prospered. This Hindu ruler should have, in fact,. 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 171 
debarred from entering into the Indian waters any Arab 
traders who used the Indian ports in this region of Sindh 
as watering and fuelling stations on their way to the 
distant eastern and southern parts of India, For the 
Hindus often had. the bitter experience of the Arab armies 
and navies following these traders by sea. But in order 
to exhibit his religious tolerance and generosity this Hindu 
ruler not only did not stop these Arabian traders from 
visiting the Indian coast, but treated them with such great 
deal of hospitality,that they might feel quite at home there. 
Naturally, these Arabic traders, actuated whether by political 
trickery or by religious pride, thought of building by way of 
a challenge, as it were, a Masjid just in front of the Somnath 
Temple, rebuilt by the Hindu Kafirs. But under the circum­ 
stances then prevalent there, they could not do so by force 
or bravado. Hence with their usual craft they applied in 
the most courteous and humble words to the King for 
permission to build the Masjid. And O what wonder ! That 
gullible Hindu King consented to it most willingly, and up 
rose the new masjid challenging the Somnath temple. As a 
matter of fact, considering the highly miserable state to 
which the Temple of Somnath was reduced by Mahmud of 
Ghazni and others, that Hindu King should have wiped out 
of existence all the masjids without exception, as soon as he 
conquered the land, and then and then alone could he have 
restored the Somnath temple to its original glory. B u t 
instead of destroying the existing masjids he permitted a new 
one to be built up and bestowed an annuity on it for its 
maintenance. For this suicidal religious tolerance (perversion 
of a virtue again !) he had very soon to pay dearly; because 
when after some time the brutal forces of Alla-ud-din and 
other Muslim aggressors attacked Gujrat and killed thousands 
of Hindu men and raped as many Hindu women, and pulled 
down hundreds of Hindu temples and marched straight 
towards Somnath, how did these Arabs and their descendants 
repay the religious tolerance of the Hindu King who allowed 
the Arabian traders to build the said masjid ? Did they allow 172 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
the restored Somnath Temple to remain unmolested in 
return for the obligation of the Hindus—even if it were to 
tantalize the Hindu gullibility and simplicity ? No ! The 
Muslim armies battered the Temple to pieces once again and 
outdid Mahmud of Ghazni in taking away the sacred idol and 
the slab inside this temple to Delhi and made them fit nicely 
into the pedestal for a masjid there". 
434. Once again, when Hindu power was established in 
the region, Hindu temples rose up and once more the 
Muslims like Sultan Ahmed Shah ravaged the land with their 
usual religious ferocity and harassed the Hindus there with 
wholesale massacres, rapes, arson and other incendiary 
•activities. Thousands of Hindus were taken prsioners and 
were sold as slaves in foreign countries^*. Somnath remained a 
heap of rubble, but the notorious masjid grew in importance: 
Besides the old masjids which were preserved and raised to 
greater glory by the Hindu rulers, the Muslim rulers build 
taller and more spacious mosques. 
435. It was this confesed religious thought, the 
distorted sense of virtues and the blind religious tolerance 
which culminated in the religious suicides of the Hindus. 
How many more incidents may one cite, which came off 
century after century at every place right from Kashmir to 
Eameshwaram, in the face of Muslim aggression ? Still one 
more instance may be narrated here to show the perversion of 
another virtue by the Hindus; generosity—misplaced 
generocity ! 
435-A. Siddharaj Jaysinh (1096-1143 A.D.) was a 
valiant king of Anhilwad in Gujrat^*. He had also a very 
keen sense of justice. But he was a Hindu king ! He was 
deluded by the absolute values, without any regard to time, 
place or person, of all the virtuous ideologies about justice 
and injustice, his own and the alien religion, generosity and 
large-heartedness ! Once during his reign there was some 
dispute between the Hindus and the Muslims near Gambay 
(Khambayat)!*. Writes Muhammad 'Ufi—himself a Muslim 
writer—in his book, Jami'-ul-Hikayat. 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 173 
436. "In the reign of King Jai Singh, there was a 
mosque and a minaret from which the summons to prayers 
was cried out. The Fire-worshippers instigated an attack on 
the Musalmans, and the minaret was destroyed, the mosque 
burnt down and eighty Musalmans were killed " 
A certain Muhammadan, a Khatib or a reader of the Khutba, 
by name Khatib 'Ali', escaped and fled to Nahrwala. None 
of the courtiers of the Rai paid any attention to him, or 
rendered him any assistance. Having learnt that the Rai was 
going out to hunt, Khatib 'Ali' sat down behind a tree in the 
forest and awaited the Rai's arrival. When the Rai reached 
the spot, Khatib Ali stood up and implored the former to 
stop the elephant and listen to the latter's complaint. He 
then placed in his hand a "Kasida", which he had composed 
in Hindi verse stating the whole case. The Rai having heard 
this complaint, placed Khatib Ali under the charge of a 
servant, ordering him to take care of him...Later disguising 
himself in tradesman's dress, the Rai entered the city (of 
Khambayat) and stayed a short time in different places in the 
market-place, making enquiries as to the truth of Khatib 
All's complaint. He then learnt that the Musalmans were 
oppressed and were slain without any grounds The 
next day he held a court He said it was his duty to 
see that all his subjects were afforded such protection as 
would enable them to live in peace. He then gave orders 
that two leading men from each class of Infidels—Brahmans, 
Fire worshippers (sometimes applied to Buddhists) and others 
—should be punished. He gave one lac Balotras to enable the 
Musalmans to rebuild the mosque and the minarets. He also 
gave some clothes to Khatib." Muhammad 'Ufi : Jami'-ul- 
Hikayat, Elliot HIED Vol. II Pp. 162-163). 
437. This Raja Jayasinh had gone on a foot pilgrimage" 
to the rejuvenated temple of Somnath and was a devotee of 
Shiva and had implicit faith in the Hindu religion. Probably 
because for this very reason in place of driving the inveterate 
and crafty Muslim enemies out of his own kingdom or instead 
of reconverting them to Hinduism, even if by means of force. 
174 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
he had the masjids—the masjids of those Muslims who had 
reduced to mere rubble, not only the temple of Somnath, but 
hundreds of other temples in Gujrat and thousands in other 
parts of India—rebuilt at the cost of the Hindus and offered 
them a special protection according to his Hindu creed of 
religious tolerance and generosity ! 
438. Was it ever possible for the Hindus under Mahmud 
of Ghazni, or Muhammad Ghori or for those in the domain of 
the Sultan who had gone on killing the Hindus and ravaging 
their lands—was it ever possible for them to complain to any 
Muslim governor of the land against the destruction of their 
own temples ? (Let alone the appeal for the restoration of 
such a demolished temple !) To complain in such a way 
would itself have amounted to a viery grave offence of the 
Kafirs, according to the Muslim religious code, and for this 
very offence every one of the Hindu men and women would 
have been sold in Kabul or Kandhar as wretched slaves. 
But such treacherous and dangerous Muslims were allowed 
by the Hindu kings to live in large colonies and were treated 
with special honour in order to bolster up their creed of 
religious tolerance. And in thousands of cases during the 
long period of Hindu-Muslim war, these very minority 
Muslims who had been living as refugees in the Hindu states 
never failed to rebel or sabotage the Hindu war-efforts as 
soon as there was any foreign Muslim invasion. Even while 
they were seeing all these treacherous activities of the 
Muslims, the Hindu kings went on practising, and commit­ 
ting to their memory, the precepts of religious tolerance and 
large-heartedness in utter disregard of the proper place, time 
or person and, of course, they fell as miserable victims. This 
is verily the distortion of virtue itself ! 
THE GRAVE DANGER OF THE MUSLIM 
ABDUCTION AND POLLUTION OF MILLIONS 
OF HINDU WOMEN 
439. One side-issue of the Muslim religious aggression, which caused a continuous drain on the numerical superiority 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 175 
of the Hindus was the diabolic Muslim faith that it was a 
religious duty of every Muslim to kidnap and force into their 
own religion, non-Muslim women. This incited their sensua­ 
lity and lust for carnage and, while it enormously increased 
their number, it affected the Hindu population in an inverse 
proprotion. To hesitate to acknowledge this hard fact under 
the guise of politeness is simply a puerile self-deception. 
This abduction of thousands and millions of H i n d u women 
by the Muslims is not such a trifling thing as to be 
dispensed with by calling it religious fanaticism or simply 
by conniving at it. Even if it were a madness, there was a 
method in it ! And the method in this Muslim madness was 
so horrible that, with the mistaken Hindu neglect of this 
so-called religious fanaticism, the Hindu nation came to have 
a perpetual bleeding sore. Eor, as a matter of fact the 
religious fanaticism of the Muslims was not madness at all; it 
was an effective method of increasing the Muslim population 
with special regard to the unavoidable laws of nature. 
440. The same law of nature is instinctively obeyed by 
the animal world. If in the cattle-herds the number of oxen 
grows in excess of the cows, the herds do not grow numerical­ 
ly in a rapid manner. But on the other hand, the number of 
animals in the herds, with the excess of cows over the oxen, 
grows in mathematical progression. The same is true of man, 
for at the core man is essentially an animal. Even in the 
pre-historic times the so-called w i l d tribes of the forest- 
dwellers knew this law quite well. The African wild tribes 
of to-day kill only the males from amongst their enemies, 
whenever there are tribal wars, but not the females, who are 
eventually distributed by the victor tribes among themselves. 
To obtain from them future progeny to increase their 
numbers is considered by these tribes to be their sacred 
duty ! It is said of at least one of the Naga tribes^^ that 
when they attack an enemy they shoot simple unpoisoned 
arrows at the males, but if any women are seen fighting on 
the enemy side highly envenomed arrows are used to kill 
them instantly. For, they argue, to kill one woman who 
176 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
cannot be captured alive is as good as to kill five men. 
441. This very natural law was adopted and obeyed 
openly by the aggressive but numerically poor African 
Muslim armies and their chiefs while attacking the major 
populations of North Africa^'. On conquering those kafiirs, 
the ransom that was collected was calculated in terms of 
money and women in equal share*", and these women, 
collected as ransom, were distributed by fives or tens amongst 
the most faithful followers of Islam. The future progeny 
of these conquered women was born Muslim and so amongst 
the Muslim environments became literally fanatical. The 
Muslim chiefs who thus multiplied their numbers rapidly were 
honoured as 'Ghazis' by the religious authorities*^. The law 
of the Muslim religious welfare granted the victorious Muslim 
army every right to own the kafir women as completely as 
their other movable or immovable property. 
442-443. After Ravan abducted Seeta and Shree 
Ramchandra marched on him, some of his well-wishers 
advised the demon King, just before the war, that because 
of his unjust act, the demon kingdom was threatened with a 
terrible war and that he should send Seeta back to her 
husband, because it was highly irreligious to kidnap her ? 
'What ?' cried the wrathful Ravan, "To abduct and rape the 
womenfolk of the enemy, do you call it irreligious ?" Pooh, 
pooh !—<M?rRT'I. i d w : "l^Rll^ErTOri; **. 
(To carry away the women of others and to ravish them 
is itself the supreme religious duty of the Rakshasas.) 
'Parodharmah', the greatest duty ! 
444. With this same shameless religious fanaticism the 
aggressive Muslims of those times considered it their highly 
religious duty to carry away forcibly the women of the 
enemy side, as if they were commonplace property, to ravish 
them, to pollute them, and to distribute them to all and 
sundry, from the Sultan to the common soldier and to absorb 
them completely in their fold. This was considered a noble 
act which increased their number*'. 
445. In every province where the Muslim rule establi- 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 
shed itself, the Sultan, the Navabs, and the Nizams—why: 
even the meanest of Muslim officers in every town and village^ 
therein levied on the Hindu population not only the Jizia 
tax for collecting wealth; but also the heinous-tax of demand­ 
ing openly the daughters and even married ladies from the 
Hindu royaP* families and others of high rank, and even; 
carried them away forcibly and openly. 
446. After Sindh, the Arabs did not attempt another 
invasion of India, yet the Arab bands did come here along 
with other Muslim armies, and like these Arabs, all those- 
newly converted people like the Persians (Iranians) the- 
Turanians, Afghans, the Turks, Moghuls and others fell on 
India with all the ferocity at their command. Obviously 
they had not brought their millions of womenfolk along 
with them. But all those from the Sultans to the common 
soldiers, as a rule, began to settle down here with the 
kidnapped Hindu women, whom they either married or 
simply kept as their concubines^^. Let alone the vast 
numbers of Hindu women of high as well as low ranks who 
led the most ignoble of lives in the harems of the Emperors, 
Sultans or Navabs, but almost every Muslim kept at least 
three or four such forcibly polluted women. Thus the 
women in this aggressive Muslim community came to b© 
more numerous than the men, and polygamy being an 
accepted practice sanctioned by their religion^*, these foreign 
Muslim communities began to grow rapidly year after year, 
from a few thousands to millions and more. 
447. An interesting point to note is that Sultan Ghiyas- 
ud-din Tughlak, Sultan Shikandar, Sultan Phiroz-Shah 
Tughlak and many other devilish Hindu-haters were born of 
Hindu mothers^' ! 
MUSLIM WOMEN TOO PLAYED THEIR DEVILISH 
PART IN THE MOLESTATION AND HARASSMENT OF 
THE HINDU WOMEN 
448. Hindu women were considered kafirs and born 
slaves. So these Muslim women were taught to think it their 
178 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
duty to help in all possible ways, their molestation and forci­ 
ble conversion to Islam. No Muslim woman whether a Begum 
or a beggar, ever protested against the atrocities committed 
by their male compatriots; on the contrary they encouraged 
them to do so and honoured them for it. A Muslim woman 
did everything in her power to harass such captured or 
kidnapped Hindu women. Not only in the troubled times 
of war but even in the intervening periods of peace and even 
when they themselves lived in the Hindu kingdoms, they 
enticed and carried away young Hindu girls locked them 
up in their own houses, or conveyed them to the Muslim 
centres in Masjids and Mosques. The Muslim women all over 
India considered it their holy duty to do so**. 
THE HINDU CHIVALRY TOWARDS ENEMY WOMEN 
449. The Muslim women never feared retribution or 
punishment at the hands of any Hindu for their heinous 
crime. They had a perverted idea of woman-chivalry. If in 
a battle the Muslims won, they were rewarded for such crafty 
and deceitful conversions of Hindu women; but even if the 
Hindus carried the field and a Hindu power was established 
in that particular place (and such incidents in those times 
were not very rare) the Muslim-men alone, if at all, suffered 
the consequential indignities but the Muslim women—never ! 
Only Muslim men, and not women, were taken prisoner. 
Muslim women were sure that even in the thick of battles 
and in the confusion wrought just after them neither the 
victor Hindu Chiefs, nor any of their common soldiers, nor 
even any civilian would ever touch their hair. For 'albeit 
enemies and atrocious, they were women' ! Hence, even when 
they were taken prisoner in battles the Muslim women,— 
royal ladies as also the commonest slaves,—were invariably 
sent back safe and sound to their respective families ! Such 
incidents were common enough in those times. And this 
act was glorified by the Hindus as their chivalry towards the 
enemy women and the generosity of their religion ! For a 
sample, read the following incidents. 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 179 
450. Even now we proudly refer to the noble acts of 
Chhatrapati Shivaji and Chimaji Appa, when they honourably 
sent back the daughter-in-law of the Muslim Governor of 
Kalyan^^ and the wife of the Portuguese governor of Bassein*" 
respectively. But is it not strange that, when they did so, 
neither Shivaji Maharaj nor Chimaji Appa should ever remem­ 
ber, the atrocities and the rapes and the molestation, 
perpetrated by Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad Ghori, 
Alla-ud-din Khilji and others, on thousands of Hindu ladies 
and girls like the princesses of Dahir, Kamaldevi,^^ the wife 
of Karnaraj of Karnawati and her extremely beautiful 
daughter, Devaldevi*^. Did not the plaintive screams and 
pitiful lamentations of the millions of molested Hindu women^ 
which reverberated throughout the length and breadth of the 
country, reach the ears of Shivaji Maharaj and Chimaji Appa? 
451. The souls of those millions of aggrieved women 
might have perhaps said, "Do not forget, 0, your Majesty, 
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and O ! your Excellency, 
Chimaji Appa, the unutterable atrocities and oppression and 
outrage committed on us by the Sultans and Muslim noble­ 
men and thousands of others, big and small. Let those 
Sultans and their peers take a fright that in the event of a 
Hindu victory our molestation and detestable lot shall be 
avenged on the Muslim women. Once they are haunted with 
this dreadful apprehension, that the Muslim women, too, 
stand in the same predicament in case the Hindus win, the 
future Muslim conquerors will never dare to think of such 
molestation of H i n d u women." 
45]-A. But because of the then prevalent perverted 
religious ideas about chivalry to women, which ultimately 
proved highly detrimental to the Hindu community, neither 
Shivaji Maharaj nor Chimaji Appa could do such wrongs to 
the Muslim women. 
452. It was the suicidal Hindu idea of chivalry to 
women which saved the Muslim women (simply because they 
were women) from the heavy punishments of committing 
indescribable sins and crimes against the Hindu women. 
180 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Their womanhood became their shield quite sufficient to 
protect them. 
453. Still worse was the ridiculous idea, which the 
Hindus of those times entertained, that it was a sin to 
convert a Muslim woman to Hinduism. They foolishly 
thought that to have any sort of relations with a Muslim 
woman meant their own conversion to Islam". Naturally, 
even in the midst of a Hindu community and the Hindu 
State they were secure against any attempt by the Hindus 
at abducting them or their forcible conversion to Hinduism. 
Exceptions however were very rare. 
454. Under these circumstances, the Muslim feminine 
class [fair (?) sex] was left seraphically free from any chastise­ 
ment or penalty for their share of the crimes perpetrated 
against the Hindu woman-world, and their work of enticing 
a,nd ensnaring the Hindu women and forcing them to 
accept Islam went on for hundreds of years unhampered and 
unimpeded. 
B U T IF 
465. Suppose, if from the earliest Muslim invasion of 
India, the Hindus also, whenever they were victors on the 
battlefields, had decided to pay the Muslim' fair sex in the 
same coin or punished them in some other waja, i.e., by con­ 
version even with force, and then absorbed them in their fold, 
then ? Then with this horrible apprehension at their heart 
they would have desisted from their evil designs against any 
Hindu lady. If they had taken such a fright in the first two 
or three centuries, millions and millions of luckless Hindu 
ladies would have been saved all their indignities, loss of 
their own religion, rapes, ravages and other unimaginable 
persecutions. Our woman-world would not have suffered 
such a tremendous numerical loss, which means their future 
progeny would not have been lost permanently to Hinduism 
and the Muslim population could not have thrived so 
audaciously. Without any increase in their womenfolk the 
Muslim population would have dwindled into a negligible 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 181 
minority. 
456. (The sociological explanation for this contention 
has already been offered in paragraphs 439 to 446). 
457. But haunted with the fantastic idea of chivalry to 
•enemy-women and a blind eye to time, place or person, the 
Hindus of that period, never tried to chastise the Muslim 
women-folk for their wrongs to Hindu women, even when the 
former were many a time completely at their mercy. 
MISPLACED CHIVALRY TO ENEMY WOMEN-FOLK 
AND THE CONSEQUENT MISERABLE PLIGHT 
458. Well, did this misplaced chivalrous idea of the 
Hindus have any salutary effect on their Muslim foes ? Were 
the latter ever ashamed of their sin of molesting a Hindu 
woman in view of this Hindu religious generosity and high- 
mindedness ? Did the Muslims ever sincerely feel thankful 
to the Hindus for the safe return of thousands of Muslim 
women to their own kith and kin? Never ! On the contrary 
they again and again reciprocated Hindu chivalrous behavi­ 
our with the same old treachery and atrocity, and thus held 
it to ridicule and scorn. 
459. On the contrary the Muslims were puffed up, 
perhaps, with the thought that i f at a l l the H i n d u s were to 
show chivalry to anybody, it should have been to their own 
Hindu women ! It was they who had the first right to such 
a chivalrous treatment ! But if the Hindus could not rescue 
thousands of their own women who were being abducted, 
polluted, and forced into Islamic religion, in their very 
presence, through centuries, why should the Muslims not 
ridicule the Hindu chivalrous idea of civility to women, even 
enemy women? On the contrary they perhaps thought that 
the Hindus dared not think of violating or even insulting the 
Muslim women for fear of horrible reprisals. Thus they 
were more likely to misconstrue the Hindu idea of chivalry, 
than interpret it in the right sense, as to have been born of 
cowardice than of strength and bravery. 182 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
THE HINDUS OF THE PRE-ISLAMIC ERA NEVER 
INTERPRETED CHIVALRY TO WOMEN IN THIS 
ANTI-NATIONAL SILLY WAY 
460. A serpent, whether male or female, if it comes to 
bite must be killed. The enemy women who enforced conversion 
and heaped all sorts of humiliation on our mothers and sisters, 
had by that very devilish act, lost their womanhood, and 
their righr to chivalrous treatment, and deserved nothing but 
only the most stringent punishment for their atrocious crimes. 
Hence, when Tratika, the she-Demon marched on Ramchandra 
with other demons, he killed her immediately, without a 
moment's thought'*. When Shoorpanakha, another she- 
demon, rushed to eat away Seeta like cucumber, Laxman 
deprived her of nose and ears and sent her back—not 
honourably with generous gifts of ornaments to show off his 
chivalay to women'*! When Narakasur carried away thou­ 
sands of Aryan women to his Asur kingdom (Assyria of 
to-day), Shree Krishna marched upon the demon and killed 
him in the war. But he did not stop with military and 
political defeat he inflicted on Narakasur ! He rescued all 
the thousands of imprisoned Aryan females, undergoing all 
sorts of humiliation there, and brought them back to his own 
kingdom; and thus took a social revenge ! Shree Krishna's 
army did not forsake their kinswomen, simply because they 
were forcibly polluted and violated—a dastardly thought 
which he never entertained for a minute. On the contrary 
Shree Krishna as the Bhoopati, the Lord of the whole Earth, 
brought all those sixteen thousand or more women to his 
kingdom, rehabilitated them honourably and took upon him­ 
self the responsibility of feeding and protecting them. This 
very act of Krishna, as the Bhoopati, has been fantastically 
construed by the writers of the Puranas as to describe him 
the husband of those thousands of women. He was later 
thought to have married all of them'®. 
461. In the post-Puranik period, whenever our valiant 
and victorious princes vanquished the enemies, like the 
Yavan, Shaka, or Hun commandants, kings or emperors on 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 183 
the battlefield, they invariably married the enemy princesses. 
This seems to have been the tradition prevalent right from 
Chandragupta Maurya to the Gupta Emperors ! Shalivahan 
kings too married Saka princesses*'. Not only our victorious 
kings but all Hindus, right from the Samants (feudatory 
princes) to common citizens married unhesitatingly Yavan, 
Saka or Hun women. The nation was valiant enough to 
absorb not only the progeny of those enemy-women but the 
whole enemy communities in their own and leave no trace of 
their origin behind ! 
HARMFUL EFFECTS OF THE BAN ON PURIFICATION 
AND REHABILITATION 
462. Under the illusion of preserving [the purity of 
their own caste and religion, the Hindu Society of the Islamic 
era began to enforce, as their religious duty, the bans on 
exchange of food, on inter-caste marriage, and other bans, 
even when they were harmful to the society. In a similar 
way, and for the same reason of protecting the purity of 
their caste and religion, the ban on repurification of the con­ 
verted Hindus and that on Sea-faring began to be enforced 
most scrupulously and rigidly as religious injunctions. 
Neither any single Hindu, who was converted under coercion, 
nor even his progeny could ever come back to Hinduism ; 
their sin (?) had no redemption, no salvation. Eor generations 
together the Hindus believed this to be their inviolable 
religious injunction ; with very rare exceptions, every Hindu, 
from sweeper to Brahmin, from Chhatrapati (the sovereign) to 
Patrapati (the holder of a parchment) ; from Shankaracharya 
(the Religious Head) to Shankhacharya (the prince of block­ 
heads), whether learned or illiterate, held this opinion about 
the ban on repurification of the converts unanimously and 
unswervingly from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. 
463. On account of these very bans, thousands of our 
Hindu ladies kindled the fires of johar, century after century, 
in order to avoid violation at the hands of the Muslims'^. To 
save themselves from this humiliation of violation by the 
m SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
enemies, millions others leapt into rivers, lakes and wells, all 
over the country and destroyed themselves along with their 
small children at their breasts. Most bravely did many 
others die defiantly refusing to be converted to Islam, like 
Chhatrapati Sambhaji, Guru Teg Bahadur and many of our 
Sikh gurus like the martyr Bairagi Baba Banda, who kept 
on defying the Muslims till the last even when his body was 
being cut off limb by limb. How can we ever forget this 
unprecedented martyrdom, unless we are ungrateful to them ? 
Few other communites in the history of the world could have 
sacrificed their lives on such a vast scale or with such severety 
as did the Hindus ! This martyrdom of the Hindus was not 
altogether futile in respect of saving their religion from the 
Muslim onslaught. The heroic tales of their martyrdom have 
been inspiring generations of the nation to offer their life 
for protecting the religion—and this is not altogether 
insignificant. 
464. Although highly detrimental to the interests of 
the nation as a whole, and as such deserving the severest 
of criticism, these various bans, like those on exchange of 
food and sea-voyage and the custom of social ostracism, 
were all imposed by the Hindus of that period—let it not be 
forgotten—with the sole noble object of protecting the purity 
of their caste and creed. Millions of Hindus, who, for 
generations, suffered unimaginable pangs, did so with 
unswerving loyalty to their accepted creed. Were they ever 
happy to boycott an individual for having—although unwill­ 
ingly and through force—taken water from a Muslim hand or 
for other such reasons ? How can one describe the agonies 
and pangs of the parents and other relatives at the unavoid­ 
able separation of their sons and daughters, of husbands 
and wives, of brothers and sisters ? How many of them might 
have courted death, owing to this extreme grief when they 
closed their doors on them, simply because they were, 
although unwillingly and forcibly, converted to Islam ? But 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 185 
they suffered all this with the grim determination, viz., 
snrW i^r^w c^rgrg; ii^'. Por the sake of the family an individual is to be abandoned. 
Por the sake of the village a family has to be forsaken. For 
the sake of the state a village has to be given up as lost, 
a.nd for the sake of religion one should give up the whole 
world ! 
465. Should we not therefore be grateful to those 
Hindus for the unbearable pangs, and unimaginable grief they 
suffered ? They were misled into accepting those traditions 
of various bans as their religious duties, but their loyalty to 
their religion was unmistaken, unshaken ! What was consi­ 
dered to be an antidote, turned out to be poison itself! 
But the object in administering it was to give an antidote, 
to save the life of the nation ! How can we, then forbear 
writing a word or two of sincere gratitude for the harrowing 
mental and physical agonies they suffered with the honest 
intention of saving their religion ? 
ANTI-NATIONAL ILLUSORY PLATITUDES ! 
466. A n effective way of liquidating the Muslim religious 
authority could easily have been availed of by the Hindus 
•of those times, if they had but done what the Muslims had 
been doing in their hundreds of offensives against Hindu 
states. The Muslims went on slaughtering wholesale the 
Hindu population. Similarly whenever the Hindus gained 
an upper hand, they could have retaliated by massacring 
Muslim population and making the region Muslim-less ! 
devoid of Muslims ! Even their ban on repurification (gf%) 
would not have prevented them from doing this. For in 
•doing this there was no question involved of eating or 
drinking or of having any dealings with the Muslims ! But—! 
But if not the ban on repurification, the suicidal Hindu 
•creed of religious tolerance was certainly a major obstacle ! 
186 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
From the very ancient times, the Hindus had been boasting 
of their high ideals of religious tolerance*", of the equal 
status they conceded to all the religions of the world, of 
preaching the sameness of Ram and Rahim, of allowing every­ 
one to follow his own faith ! This they considered to be 
the height of their religion ! 
467. Instead of massacring en masse the hundreds of 
thousands of Muslims, who from time to time fell in their 
hands completely vanquished and utterly helpless, in order 
to avenge the untold wrongs and humiliation heaped by 
them on Hindus, the Hindus in their turn refrained them­ 
selves from doing the Muslims even the slightest harm 
because they were in minority, and belonged to another 
religion. On the contrary, the Muslins were allowed to. 
enhance the glory and scope of their own religion without 
the least possible hindrance. Not only like the Hindu citizens, 
but even more leniently and with more facilities were the 
Muslims allowed, by Hindu states of those days, to enjoy the 
legal rights*!—a fact which is borne out by pages after pages 
of Indian history. 
468. Is it necessary to add that these 'cow-faced' 
followers of Hinduism*8<», proud of their utmost tolerance of 
other religions were not (in the least) likely to hit back the 
tiger-faced Muslims on religious grounds ? 
469. Religious tolerance ! A virtue ! Yes, It can be 
a virtue only where the other religion is tolerant of our own I 
But to tolerate the Muslim religion, the followers of which 
right from the Sultans like Mahmud of Ghazni and Ghori 
and others to the various Shahs and Badshahs thought it 
their religious obligation to massacre the Kafiir Hindus to 
celebrate their accession to the throne and had been carrying 
on horrible religious persecution of the Hindus for nearly 
a thousand years, was tantamount to cut the throat of one's 
own religion ! It was not tolerance towards other religions, 
it was tolerance of irreligion ! It was not even tolerance, 
it was impotence ! But this truth never dawned upon the 
Hindu society of those days even after the horrible experience 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 187 
of a thousand years or so. They on their own part went on 
tolerating even such a hideous religion as the Islam and 
considered it a glorious virtue of their own—a special 
ornament in the crown of the Hindu community ! 
470. 0 thou Hindu society ! Of all the sins and weak­ 
nesses, which have brought about thy fall, the greatest and 
most potent are thy virtues themselves. 
471-472. Ahimsa (non-violence), kindness, chivalry 
even towards the enemy women, protection of an abjectly 
c a p i t u l a t i n g e n e m y , f^'JI'T^ ( f o r g i v e n e s s , a g l o r i o u s - 
emblem for the brave ! ) and religious tolerance were all 
virtues no doubt—very noble virtues ! But it is blind and 
slovenly—even impotent—adoption of all these very virtues, 
irrespective of any consideration given to the propriety of 
time, place or persons that so horribly vanquished them in 
the milliennial Hindu-Muslim war on the religious front. 
For 
[Every virtuous act done without the least regard to- 
the propriety of the persons concerned—without the least 
thought whether the other person deserves such noble 
treatment or not—becomes a glaring vice most harmful to- 
the true religion.] 
CHAPTER IX 
SUPER-DIABOLIC COUNTER-OFFENSIVE THE ONLY ANSWER 
473 It has already been shown in the earlier chapters how the Hindu Society was unable to recover its tremendous numericall osses suffered due to forcible mass conversions and tyrannical anti-Hindu laws of Muslim kings and Sultans, because of its own silly, anti-national traditions of caste- differences, bans on reconversion of the helpless Hindu prose­ lytes, and the like, and many other perverted concepts of virtue. Had it not been for some prophetic social and religious reformers, astute diplomats, gigantic thinkers and philosophers and men of action among the Hindus of that time who towered, though only from time to time, over the all-pervading gloom and guided their community, the Hindu society would never have escaped total extinction. 
MAHARSHI DEVAL AND MEDHATITHI 
474. Two of these thinkers are Maharshi Deval and Medhatithi, the critics of Manusmriti, who unfailingly attract our attention, because of their dazzling intellectual brilliance. Their extant writings show us, beyond any shadow of doubt, that even during those calamitous years, that intervened between the first Arab invasion of Sindh and the Muslim religio-political atrocities in the Punjab and its final occupa­ tion, they had pointed out to the Hindus brave new ways, new religious thoughts, new weapons, which were calculated to bring them success. 
475-476. The Chapter on the pollution of religion in Deval Smriti, begins with the line. 
It clearly shows that it was in Sindh first that a section 
5fH GLORIOUS EPOCH 18& 
of Brahmins, Kshatriyas and others was organized. It 
determined to improve the code of social and religious 
behaviour of the Hindus as much, at least, as to recuperate 
the numerically stupendous losses suffered at the hands of the 
Muslims. For they clearly saw that the laws of behaviour 
laid down in different smritis were in every way powerless to 
counteract the armed religio-political aggressionof the enemy. 
The Hindu leaders, present in the hermitage of DeVal on the 
bank of the Indus, once asked the sage, "Will it be possible 
to bring back to Hinduism thousands of Hindu men and 
women, who have fallen victim to the religious persecution 
of the Muslims and have been forcibly converted to Islam 
by some form of atonement and by repurification ?" The 
verses in Deval Smriti clearly mention that such type of 
discussions were held at different times and the authorita­ 
tive and final answers were given and the rules of conduct 
propounded by Maharshi Deval favouring reconversion^. These 
advocates and writers of this new Smriti and their followers 
declared as unlawful and irreligious in those adverse circum­ 
stances, the very religious act of banning reconversion, as 
it was causing tremendous numerical losses to the Hindus*. 
SPECIAL WEAPONS FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS 
477-478. In the armoury of our religious code of conduct 
there always had been very special and progressive weapons 
for meeting very special and exceptional circumstances. All 
that was needed was a class of leaders to use them from 
time to time ! If in the initial stages of adverse times of 
the Hindu-Muslim war, these special and exceptional 
weapons had only been unsheathed and sharpened, Hinduism 
itself might have completely routed Islam from the Indian 
soil, as it happened when the valiant (because they were 
attacking the enemy !) and victory-longing gods and the 
Aryans fought with the demons (dashyus). Even if the same 
religious resplendence was not uniformly shown by the 
Hindus, it was, in some measure, seen in the revolutionary 
religious reforms of Deval Maharshi of Sind. Maharshi 
190 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Deval is said to have lived sometime between A.D. 800 to 
A . D . 900*. 
479. Because of this religious resplendence alone, Deval 
Maharshi could kick away the traditional religious ban on 
redemption for the unwilling converts and propounded in his 
•Smriti an expedient of atonement for the sin of conversion. 
It has been laid down in the Deval Smriti, that if, within a 
certain period of his or her forcible conversion to Islam, a 
Hindu man or woman showed his or her desire to be reconver­ 
ted to Hinduism with due atonement, he or she was to be ad­ 
ministered simple and practical penance of fast or something ^ 
else and absorbed once again in the Hindu society*. The 
liberal attitude of this Smriti towards women, in the context 
of the times, is specially laudable. It enjoined that the 
women forcibly converted to Islam, or those who served in 
the Muslim households as menial servants or slaves be 
•considered pure after their next menses*, and should be 
completely absorbed in the Hindu community. Even a 
pregnant Hindu woman, freed from the Muslim bondage, was 
to be considered as pure as a bar of gold after being heated 
in the goldsmith's chafing dish, once her foetus came out after 
delivery'. 
480. It is, however really strange, that even this Deval 
Smriti which was so particular about the repurification and 
reconversion of the fallen Hindu women, with a view to stopp­ 
ing the numerical losses of our community, should not have 
cared to do the same for their children born of the Muslim 
women. It is very difficult to explain why it should have failed 
to do so*. We were reminded of this Deval Smriti when 
once we were told of a custom amongst the Bengali Hindus : 
if a child-widow or an unmarried girl in a Hindu family gave 
•birth to an illegitimate child it was to be solicitously given 
over to the Muslims who lived beyond the local river for 
being brought up as their own. This expedient was no doubt * 
thought of by the Hindu priesthood with the best intention 
of saving the family from public humiliation and the 
society from every contagion of that sin. The Muslims too.

thinking that these Hindu children increased their number, gladly accepted them. The simple god-fearing Hindus on the other hand never for once understood that their own number decreased to that extent. It is quite evident that this Bengali custom must have been popularized by some Smriti like the Deval Smriti. 
481. The basic cause of this cowardly arrangement made by even those reformers who condemned the caste division, ban on repurification of the 'fallen', and favoured reconversion, was the deep-rooted silly belief of the Hindus that the purity of the caste was to be preserved at all costs and even at the risk of caste-extinction. But the Hindu society of those days never understood that the very same purity of their caste was lost when lakhs of their women fell into the hands of the Muslims, and that if those prohi­ bitions on reconversion were to continue the whole of the Hindu society would perish. 
482. Another thing to be noted is that the portion, now extant, of the Deval Smriti does not provide for the conversion of the original Muslims to Hinduism as it did for the conversion of the unfortunate Hindu converts. The reason probably is only this that the Hindus considered it a great sin to admit another community into their own fold. Even the religious law-givers up to the writer of the Bhagwat Geeta* seemed to be extremely worried how to keep off the intermingling of the castes and subcastes within the Hindu Society itself. 
483. In fine, we can say, the daring reformers in the Ashram of Maharshi Deval made at least some provision for admitting the forcibly converted Hindu men and women to the Hindu society. But it seems that the writers of Smritis and the warriors of the time dared not use at every stage more violent means to beat down the monstrously violent Muslim aggression. Nevertheless under the adverse circumstances, when the Muslim power had established itself firmly in the land, this religious revolt of the hundreds of Hindu leaders like Deval and others was not a small thing. 
192 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
CHECK ON MUSLIM RELIGIOUS AGGRESSION 
IN SINDH 
484. Strangely enough the above-mentioned attempt of the Hindu leaders like Deval was supported by the Hindu society as a whole. The Hindu society which was originally zealously fond of their caste-system reconverted thousands of convert men and women and absorbed them in their midsti". Not only on the political (cf. para 357) front but on the religious front, too, the Muslims were thus beaten completely in Sindh. This two-fold victory of the Hindus in Sindh—of reconquering Sindh within thirty years of Kasim's invasion and maintaining their grip on it for nearly two hundred years afterwards, and of the revolutionary redemption of the 'fallen', by Maharshi Deval and others—has to be stressed again and again as it has not been adequately described, not even mentioned at all, in Indian histories. 
485. Although there is very slender evidence on our &ide to bear out this two-fold Hindu victory in Sindh, we can find a stronger proof in the writings of the enemy. The Muslim writers were vexed at their general rout in the reconquest of Sindh by the Hindus^^. 
486. A l Biladuri (or Baladhuri) writes, "In the days of Tamim, the Musalmans retired from several parts of India, and left their position Hakim son of Awanah al Kalbi succeeded Tamim. The people of India had returned to idolatory excepting those of Kassah and the Musalmans had no place of security in which they could take refuge, so he built a town on the other side of the lake facing India and called it Al Mahfuza, "the secure", and this he made a place of refuge and security for them and their chief town." (Elliot HIED Vol I P.126) 
487. History places Maharshi Deval somewhere between A.D. 800 to A.D. 900. Round about this period i.e. about A.D. 860 to A.D. 950 was born fortunately for the Hindus another upholder of this new surge of religious revival. He sought to overcome the disastrous Muslim religious aggression with -still more disastrous counter-aggression. 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 19S 
The weapon worship religious law given by Acharya Madha- tithi^^, became the most effective guidance to the Hindus, like the Arthashastra of Arya Chanakya to the generation of the valiant Chandragupta Maurya. To the whole of Aryavarta he wanted to teach once again the lesson of expansionism and victorious imperialism^^. Medhatithi, the new interpreter of Mamsmriti, was the sole religious leader and perhaps the last of the writers of Smriti. He tried tO' erect before the perplexd Hindus of the 9th and 10th centuries a huge light-house tower of the former Aryan imperialism and expansionism of Chanakya and to regenerate into them new courage to push ahead determinedly and strike hard at the aggressor. His intention was clearly to animate his society with the vibrant inspiration to repulse instantly the- armed religious aggression of the Muslims of those times in the same magnificent tradition of the Aryan empires of old a n d w i t h t h e i r m i l i t a r y s t r a t e g y i n fighting d o w n t h e aggressive Rakshasas (enemies). He wanted the Hindus to establish not only the old empire of Aryavarta, but to conquer and annex the Muslim states even beyond the limits- of Aryavarta and establish Hinduism there, if necessary even with force. The Aryan slogan 'Krunvanto Vishvam Aryam" (We are going to make the whole world Aryan) of the Vedic times resounds incessantly throughout his critique on Mamsmriti- 
488. There had been a great confusion wrought in the Hindu Society over a thousand years or so preceding Medhatithi's age by the anti-national and imbecile social traditions, (which we have mentioned so far and will mention hereafter) about the differentiation of caste, religious tolerance and fear of pollution, which appeared as if laid down by the smritis (Vedas) and ruled as per the injunction of the Smritis. The critic Medhatithi was the only one who on seeing the miserable plight of the Hindus determined to check their downward course and convulse the imbecile and intellectually stagnant Hindu society into its original Aryan form. Naturally, he decided to criticise Mamsmriti 
194 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
itself which was considered to be the basic foundation of all other smritis. He ruthlessly tested the laws of political conduct propounded therein on the anvil of Chanakya's 
•Arthashastra^^. In this way, with the original Manusmriti of the Aryans in one hand and the empire-worshipping, conquest-loving Kautilya's Arthashastra in the other Medhatithi declared as irreligious all the codes of conduct which had been rendered impotent because of the imbecile and intellectually sterile Hindu Ahimsai^. With one stroke of remonstrance like the following :— 
489. m ^? ?I^JT: i 
lie rendered not only all the silly 'codes of conduct' buc even the smritis that called them caste-laws absolutely defunct and valueless. 
490. Most probably Medhatithi might have seen and heard about all the religious persecution by the Muslims in Sindh and the Punjab and the failure of the Hindus, for various reasons already discussed, to avenge it or even to counteract it effectively. Naturally, in order to din once again into the ears of the then defeated, fallen and perplexed Aryan nation the echoes of the smritis of the old Aryavarta, which was on its way to glory and which 'with the motto ^cjriiit stl^ on its banner was conquering in all directions, Medhatithi picked up and extolled in his own critique, as Manu's original commandments, only the warlike, arms-ador­ ing, and imperialistic religious rites and precepts. All others he condemned as ^<cii^: (smritis against the Vedas) ! His 
thundering sentences did not befit the then powerless Hindu kings, nor could those kings utter them with proper dignity and grandeur. Those precepts were really meant for an Emperor like Chandragupta or Emperor Pushyamitra ! 
491-492. Medhatithi clearly declares that to invade another kingdom—especially, an enemy state—can never be an injustice in political science^^. It is, on the other hand, the duty of a king, he said, to pounce upon the non-Hindu enemy and crush him before he grows powerful enough to 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 196 
invade the former. In statesmanship, the protection of the Aryavarta is the supreme duty of a king. That is why he condemns as suicidal, dilatory and so adverse to the kingly duty, everything that the other impudent, foolhardy critics recommend as proper code of conduct : viz. that while attack­ ing a foreign kingdom, and especially the Muslim kingdom, the Aryan kings should not strike till the other gives offence of some sort or the other." On the contrary, he says that the neighbouring king is an enemy is in itself his fault"; at an opportune moment he should be pounced upon 
•and crushed. What more, if the neighbouring non-Aryan kingdom is seen to be getting stronger and mightier than our Aryan state, whether it is guilty of any tangible offence or not, we should ourselves form alliance with other friendly or unfriendly powers and go to war against this non-Aryan state, the moment we are assured of success. 
493. Throughout the critical treatise of Medhatithi one 
•dominant aspiration makes itself felt on almost every page th^t the smaller states of Shreeman Bhojraj, the Rajput princes and other Hindu kings should be united into a powerful kingdom and once again a mighty empire like the old—nay an invincible and victorious Bharatiya Empire— should rise on the Indian soil. From this point of view, while writing about the other kingly duties he has emphasized one, viz. that even before the Mlenchchas (non-Aryans) attack an Aryan state, the latter should march against the enemy kingdom. Once you are engaged in war with the enemy, you should throw kindness and generosity to the winds and crush the enemy outright. The crafty enemy should be struck down with super-cunning and skilful deception under any pretext whatsoever. In war the so-called virtues like honesty, simplicity, consistency in speech and action and politeness, gentility and generosity themselves prove fata! to the nation. Hence, a king should not fall a prey to them—should keep himself aloof from them. 
494. Medhatithi has most powerfully expounded this sort of stern political theory (ethics). For is was absolutely 
196 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
essential for saving the Hindus from complete annihilation at the hands of the Muslims because of their simplicity. To teach them the arch-diplomacy of Arya Chanakya was his sole aim. Medhatithi plainly says that the Aryadharma no­ where decrees that the Aryans should confine themselves to the boundaries of Aryavarta. On the contrary the, pith and marrow of the religious code of the Hindus, he says, is that if the mighty Aryan kings invade the non-Aryan kingdoms beyond the Aryavarta and conquer them and immediately spread their Aryadharma there and finally establish their empire in those lands, then even those former non-Aryan lands should thereafter be considered Aryan lands and incorporated in Aryavarta I^* 
495. At least some Hindu states^' of those times followed these precepts of Medhatithi and like Chanakya's ideal disciple, Chandragupta, literally crossed the boundaries of Aryavarta and waged successful wars against the Muslim powers. Although to the north, the frontier Hindu states were forced, not to cross but to defend their boundaries, yet till nearly one hundred and fifty years after the death of Mahmud of Ghazni the Southern Hindu states remained independent and powerful. So the South Indian Hindu States were able to carry out the victorious political experiments of the Mauryan era as per the injunctions of Medhatithi. And that is why the Kalingas, the Pandyas, the Cheras, Cholas and other Hindu states sent powerful naval expeditions across the Western (often misnamed the Arabian Sea) the Southern and the Eastern Seas carrying their victorious banner to the non-Aryan kingdoms right up to the African coast on the one side and the Chinese on the other*". The astonishing fact is that while in the north Mahmud of Ghazni and Mohammed Ghori were ravaging and plundering capital after capital and temple after temple of the Hindus, and trampling down their powerful kingdoms, in the South the colossal temples like the one at Bhuvaneshwar were being erected*'-. Kings like Rajendra Chola marched with their mighty victorious naval forces, through Burma, Pegu, the Andamans and the Nicobars 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 197 
and other archipelagos in the Eastern Sea**. They visited the Hindu confederate states in Java, Indo-China, and Thailand, conquered the Lakhadiv and Maldiva island states in the W e s t e r n S e a , a n d finally c o n q u e r i n g C e y l o n h o i s t e d t h e i r invincible flag on the Southern Ocean*'. 
496. It is doubtless that on the strength of religious authority of Medhatithi illumined by the glorious tradition of Chanakya these victorious Hindu naval forces conquered kingdom after kingdom beyond the great seas and annexed them to the Aryan empire. This was accomplished not on the hobby horse of tight conventions, and rigid injunctions which came into force a century or two before, but because of the enlightening and guiding commentaries of Medhatithi. 
CHAPTER X 
INTERMITTENT HINDU RETALIATION AGAINST MUSLIM RELIGIOUS AGGRESSION 
497. At the end of an earlier chapter we had expressed our astonishment as to how the Hindu Society did not perish Completely in spite of the various defects of class-differences, ban on reconversion, misconceptions about virtues and the like, and how it escaped with the loss of only some millions; of Hindus converted. For, beyond the frontiers of India wherever such Muslim religious aggression took place, the natives there were totally deprived of their religions^. The northern coast of Africa up to Spain and the Asian lands up to the frontiers of India were totally converted to Islam. But in India alone their attempts were not completely successful*. At the time of Muhammad Kasim's invasion of Sindh in the 8th century and then from the 11th century i.e.. for nearly a thousand years from the marauding expedition of Mahmud of Ghazni and of Ghori to the complete overthrow of the Moghul [empire by the Peshwas in the 18th century, the Muslim invaders violently con-verted lakhs of Hindus and tried to multiply their numbers. The circumstances in this land—most adverse for the Hindus—also favoured them. Why then did the Muslims fail to destroy the Hindu Society completely ? 
498. The first reason which can explain this strange occurrence is the political defeat which the Hindus inflicted on these Muslims. In the initial stages Bhim' and Rana Pratap* and other Rajput princes and next the Hindu kings of Vijayanagar^ had rendered the Muslim power out of gear and crippled it. Lastly the Marathas dealt it deadly blows and fluttered their victorious banner under the leadership of the Peshwar right up to Attock. This political defeat of the 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 19^ 
Muslims at the hands of the Hindus, -which is well known to all, made it impossible for the Muslims to bring all the Hindus under their green flag. 
499. But the other potent reason for this strange- phenomenon is that there arose from time to time heroic men and women -warriors who staunchly opposed the armed religious aggression of the Muslims with counter-aggression following the precepts of Maharshi Deval and Medhatithi. It is this counter-aggression on the religious front by the Hindus that has really saved the Hindu society from total extinction. Some stray incidents are cited here to show how the Hindus did it. 
500. (1) After the Muslims conquered Sindh, the celebrated Bappa Raval of Mevad* attacked not only Sindb but the Muslim strongholds beyond that land and annexed them to his territory. He even went further. As the Rassos (Political biographies) of the Rajput princes tell us, he married a Muslim princess^ who was captured at the final Muslim rout and kept her in his harem along with his other queens. His offsprings from this Muslim converted princess were respected in the society as born in the family of the Sun god*. In respect of this progeny of the King of Mevad, the Hindus of that time did not always act with foolish religioeity of the Marathas who refused to accept the son of the valiant Bajirao Peshwa from his Muslim wife, Mastani, and forced the child back into the Muslim society^. 
501. (2) Raval Chechak of Jaisalmir married the dau­ ghter of Sultan Haibatkhan, named Somaldevi and established her honourably in his Yadav race^". 
602. (3) When Knnwar Jagmal, the eldest son of Rao Mallinath R a t h o d of Marwad heroically defeated the Muslim Sultan of Gujarat and annexed it to his own domain, he- married publicly the daughter of the Sultan, called Gindoli who was renowned for her exceptional beauty, and established his offsprings, born of her, amongst the high ranked Jagirdars of Marwad and assimilated them amongst the Rajputs completely!!. 
•200 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
503. (4) Besides all these, the Hindus here and there seem to have effected bold, prudent counter-strokes to the terrible calamity of the mass conversions of Hindus by the Muslim aggressors, and foiled their attempts^*. For instance, Baimal, the King of Marwad, captured 600 Muslim women, and after reconverting them to Hinduism married them publicly to several noblemen of his court. 
504. (5) Kumbha'rana of Mevad likewise defeated the Muslims taking all the captured Muslim women to his king­ dom. He reconverted them and married them to his noblemen as per their wishes^*. 
505. (6) The celebrated historian of Rajastan, Major Tod, has narrated many more instances of this type. 
506. (7) The different political histories, called Rassos of the Rajput royal families, also mention many instances of this type of conversion and assimilation of Muslim women into the Hindu society. 
.507. (8) Raja Jayasthiti of Nepal also avenged Muslim religious aggression in like manner. He too followed Medhati­ thi's policy of crushing the wicked enemy. About A.D. 1360, Shamsuddin, the Newab of Bengal, attacked Nepal and played havoc there, destroying many Hindu and Buddhist temples, converting violently hundreds of Hindu and Buddhist subjects. When this brave Hindu King came to the throne he made Nepal a hot-bed for the Muslims, drove them out completely and avenged the wrongs done to his subjects. Not only did he rebuild the ruined Hindu and Buddhist temples but he even reconverted to Hinduism all the unfor­ tunate Hindus and Buddhists who had been the victims of the Muslim aggression^*, 
508. (9) In the historical records of the times, like the Tarikhs^^ one curiously finds the Muslim writers themselves complaining that, at the least opportunity, the Hindu Kafirs converted even the Muslim women^* to Hinduism and married them in the Hindu community. Such events, of which no trace whatever can be found in our Hindu historical books, are available only in the Muslim historical records. • 5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 201 
509. (10) For instance, in Tarikh-i-Sorathi', its Muslim 
T^riter says, "Even at the troubled times of Mahmud Ghazni's 
expeditions the King of Anhilwad at the firstl* opportunity 
carried away several of the Turkish, Moghul and Afghan 
women who lingered behind and the Hindus married them 
•unhesitatingly." He also puts it on record that 'whenever 
possible the Hindus carried away Muslim women en masse 
and converted them to Hinduism !' He has also given some 
interesting information on the purification and reconversion 
•ceremony of Muslim women performed by the Hindus^^ 
510. He says, 'while converting the Muslim women as a 
class, the Hindu priests burned some barley over their 
heads*". Then they were given some water mixed with cow- 
dung (of course i^M'M) to drink. Then they were considered 
fit for all mutual dealings and the Hindus married them as 
per their tastes and desires. At some places, in the ceremo­ 
nial mass conversion of Muslim women these Hindus gave 
them purgatives and vomitting drugs, and thereafter distri- 
Ijuted them among the various Hindu castes and classes 
•according to their ranks. The fairest women fell to the lot 
of high ranking Hindus. Sardars and noblemen married 
those of decent birth and lineage while the maids and slaves 
were wedded to the Hindus of their respective classes. The 
whole progeny of these women was completely merged into 
those respective classes of the Hindu society." 
511. (11) When Arundevrai of Ajmer overcame the 
Muslims and ousted them from his land, he performed a great 
ceremony to purify the land which was rendered impure by 
the Muslim contact and at that holy place built a big temple 
•and a lake named'Anasagar'*!. All the men and women 
who were converted at the time of the Muslim domination 
were all reconverted to Hinduism by merely dipping into 
this Anasagar lake, and moreover, it was given out as a 
religious precept that whichever Muslim convert bathed in 
this lake, with due declaration of his intention, and accord­ 
ing to some procedure, was to be considered purified and 
could enter Hinduism. 
202 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
612. (12) Amarsing Maharaj of Jaisalmir also performed a similar ceremony and built a lake called Amarsagar. In this lake, sanctified by the great ceremony, thousands of Hindus in Sindh, who were formerly converted to Islam, dipped en masse, declaring their intention to enter into Hinduism and chanted Mantras while they bathed, and the religious authorities recognised their purification and reconversion to Hinduism. 
613. (13) A reference has to be made to Shree Vidya- ranyaswami who like Maharshi Deval and Medhatithi tried to check the Muslim religious aggression by inspiring the Hindus to retaliate by bringing forth revolutionary proofs**^ of religious authority and sometimes enunciating new religi­ ous laws** for the purpose. Shree Vidyaranyaswami had. accepted not only the supreme leadership (authority) of the religious institution of Shankaracharya at Shringeri, but also of the revolutionary institution designed to overthrow the Muslim power and to establish in its place a Hindu empire in order to protect Hinduism**. He produced not only religious authority for the reconversion of the unfortu­ nate Hindus leading a miserable life under Islam, but he himself publicly reconverted the once forcibly converted Harihar and Bukka ; and when these two great warriors, defeated the Muslims on several occasions and established in A.D. 1336 the Hindu State of Vijayanagar, he himself crowned and reconverted Harihar as the Hindu Emperor*^. 
514. After the overthrow of the Muslim power in Gomantak this very Vidyaranya Madhavacharya built at a. holy place a lake named Madhavteerth and effected mass- reconversion of the Muslimized Hindus with ceremonial baths in it. He also provided a religious authority for the future reconversion and purification. 
515. (14) Shree Ramanujacharya, his disciples Shree Ramanand and Shree Chaitanya Prabhu*^ of Bengal also purified hundreds of Muslimized Hindus with an administra­ tion of the vows of Vaishnavism. 
516. (15) It is well known that the most daring and. 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 203: 
valiant Shree Shiyachhatrapati who avenged all the wrongs done to the Hindus by establishing a Hindu independent state, himself reconverted Bajaji Nimbalkar*'' and Netaji Palkar** who had been forced to court Islam. 
A COUNTER-AGGRESSION ? 
517. (16) Towards the end of his carreer, Aurangzeb- opened, with his huge fourfold army, the most determined offensive against the Hindus. Before he fell upon the Mara­ thas he wanted to crush the Rajputs. But no sooner did he go away to the South, the Rajputs retaliated with the same vehemence and vigour and made up for the humiliation and numerical losses of the Hindus. The glaring instance of Jodhpur may be cited here*®. Under the leadership of the powerful Maharana Jaswantsingh and the brave Durgadas; Rathod, not only the Masjids erected by Aurangzeb on the ruins of Hindu temples, but all other Masjids also were raised to the ground and on their site Hindu temples were built. The Jodhpurian Rajputs reconverted not only the Muslimized Hindus but as many of the Muslims as they could on an extensive scale. If the Muslim armies went on throwing beef into the Hindu temples and wells, the Rathod armies cast, pork'" in Masjid after Masjid and paid them in the same coin. Hundreds of Muslim women were converted to Hinduism and married to the Rajputs or were simply kept as concubi­ nes like the Hindu women by the Muslims before them. The whole of the Muslim society in Rajputana was horror-stricken to see this ferocious outburst of Hindu rage. Not merely for the sin of eating and drinking with the Muslims, but for having cohabited with and married Muslim women, and even keeping them in their houses, Hindus were no longer socially ostracized. For at least thirty to forty years this Hindu retahatory aggression on the Muslims spread and glowed and resounded through town after town and village after village in the Hindu states in Rajasthan. It is of course, needless to say that with the decline of the power of the brave Durga­ das Rathod, this ferocious appearance of the Hindu society 
204 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
also vanished'!. 
REASON ? 
518. The reason is only this that the abiding state of 
the Hindu mind at that time did not favour religious 
counter-aggression, but social boycott. 
THE INNATE CAPACITY OF THE HINDUS FOR REJUVENATION 
519. It is interesting to note how side by side with the repeated annihilating aggressions of Mahmud of Ghanzi and 
•Ghori and other Muslims; and side by side, again, with huge numerical losses suffered by the Hindus because of their morbid misconception of virtues and caste-differences and the ban on repurification and reconversion, the age-old native missionary spirit and urge of the Hindu nation also burst into action elsewhere, acquiring not only political power but assimilating newer tribes of thousands of people ! The story of the conversion of the Ahom'* tribe in Assam to Hinduism can be cited here as a sample, noting at the same time the spread of the Hindu empire in Indo-China and beyond, referred to already towards the end of the last 
•chapter. 
520. While hundreds of Hindu warships and merchant- marine were lording over the vast seas and oceans—the Gangasagar (The Bay of Bengal), the Sindhusagar (the Bay of ^ Bombay) and the whole of the Indian Ocean—right from the Southern end of Africa to the very coast of China, it was impossible for any Hindu to have ever thought of the beg­ garly ban on Sea-Voyage ! This conquest of the seas (by the 
Hindus) is also referred to earlier. The conversion of the Ahom tribe to Hinduism is described here as an illustration of how vis-a-vis the vast numerical losses suffered in the north because of the diabolic onslaughts of the Mahmud of Ghazni and Ghori, the Hindus went on winning religious victories and assimilating thousands of alien people into the Hindu religion. 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 205 
521. Beyond Assam, many wild tribes lived a nomadie life for generations together, subsisting on marauding and plunder. Ahom, a branch of one of these tribes, called Shan'*^ began to press hard since the 8th century A.D. on the Hindu kings of Varman, Salstam and Pal'* dynasties adjoining Assam. In the end in A.D. 1228 King Sukapha began to rule all these lands'^. He was the first king to call himself and his subjects Ahom'^—Ajod—i.e. unrivalled ! These new administrators of the land boldly and successfully faced even the Moghul might". Sukapha's kingdom was also called Ahom, and modern Assam, in the opinion of some scholars^ is the corrupt form of Ahom". 
521-A. The most astonishing fact is that among these- various mountain tribes, as among the Huns and Sakas, the Hindu missions and missionaries then existing there had planted the principles and rules of religious conduct, as laid down by Hinduism, so deeply and firmly that as soon as he conquered Assam in A.D- 1554 another Ahom king along with many of his tribe accepted Hinduism'*. Gradually that whole tribe of thousands of people merged itself into the Hindu society. That king changed his original name in the Shan dialect to Jaydhwajsingh*", a name among the Hindu Kshatriyas. All the later Ahom kings too took for themselves Hindu names alone*!. 
B A N O N C R O S S I N G A T T O C K A N D S E A - V O Y A G E 
522. While the brave tribes, like the above-mentioned Ahom, were courting Hinduism even in its evil days, there was no likelihood of any ban on purification or any caste- differences to stop them from doing so. For these only made some new addition to the already existing numerous castes in the Hindu nation. Some of their customs and manners were limited to their particular castes but all other rites and ceremonies were common to all in strict conformity with the injunctions of the Hindu Smritis*'. The ban on purification and reconversion was being enforced more and more strictly only towards the north up to the Punjab, solely because of 
206 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
the ruthless atrocities of the Muslims. The rest of the Indian continent was wholly free from the danger of Muslim domina­ tion. The Muslims had not yet made any further headway. ^Naturally the ban on purification and reconversion had not so far^presented itself to them in any urgency. It should be told here that the ban on the crossing of the Attock, i.e. the injunction appearing in the later smritis, declaring it a sin to cross the Indus and to go over into the Muslim lands, must have been promulgated by our traditionalist priesthood with the sole intention of saving Hinduism. For, it was impossible that crossing the Indus meant abandoning Hinduism (the Vedic cult) and being polluted, as it is now amply proved that even after the ravages of Mahmud of Ghazni, the whole of the region beyond the Indus even up to the Mount Pariyatra (Hindukush mountains) was reconquered by the Hindus and the Hindu rule spread up to Khotan. Even up to that time 'Krunvanto Vishwam Aryam' was the motto inscribed on our national flag. 'Traverse the whole world for spreading Aryadharma' was the supreme unqualified religious order of the day ! 
523-4. But it becomes clear from the historical facts mentioned above that it is only when the Hindu states beyond the Indus were liquidated, thousands of Hindus began to be violently converted to Islam by the devilish Muslims, who subjected the followers of other religions to harrowing persecution. The ban on crossing the Attock must, therefore, have been enforced owing to the helplessness caused by the lack of any armed support for the Hindus in those regions. Another proof of this is the provision in the (Smrityaite) smarta order (order-system-laid down by the smritis) for adding or deleting according to the times and circumstances the religious duties beneficial or harmful to the nation. The verse : 
'Different were the religious rites and duties of the krit, Dwapar and other epochs (ages) (But) owing to the deterioration of the ages the 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 207 
duties of men have come to be different' 
^ ' ^ ^ ^ ^^?: 
•expresses the idea very succinctly. 
525. Naturally when the Hindu kingdoms beyond the Indus were lost and the Hindus and Persians and others were converted to Islam, under unbearable persecution by the Muslim powers established there, and as such when to go beyond the Indus became as horrible as to abandon one's own religion, it must have become absolutely necessary for the smritis to issue the new order of the darkest hour (adverse times) that it was sinful for any Hindu to cross the Indus, that the land beyond the Indus should be considered a Muslim land. From this time onwards therefore, the ban on crossing Attock must have been strictly enforced. 
626-528. The verse in Bhavishya Puran** which describes the new boundaries of India, and which I myself brought to light for the first time**. 
'The Aryan nation is best called Sindhusthan. The land beyond the Indus is made the land of the Muslims by that great soul.' 
%H TflcTRT II 
must have been appended to the smritis at this time i.e. after Mohammed Ghori's invasion. This time is also mentioned in that verse itself. The then Hindu Maharaja—great King— who fixed this boundary, and who is referred to here by the phrase 'by that great soul' must probably be Maharaja Bhoj*® of Dhara (C 999 AC - 1054 AC) the greatest among the Hindu rulers of the time. 
208 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
SMRITIS AND THE BAN ON SEA VOYAGES 
629. Although the Muslim political conquests in the 
north brought upon the Hindu nation this miserable calamity 
of narrowing the northern and north-western boundaries of 
India, yet it was limited to the north alone. The rest of 
India, on this side of the Punjab, the whole of Sindhusthan 
was free to assimilate newer tribes beyond Assam, free to be 
the mistress of the eastern, western and southern seas and 
extend its rule right up to Indo-China and win new victories. 
Sinhaldweep (Ceylon) was also a Baby India—a setellite 
Indian state ! For, the island of Ceylon had all along been 
ruled by royal dynasties of Indian extraction**! The same is 
true of the Lakhadiv and Maldiv and other archipelagos*" in 
the vast ocean up to the African Coast, which were under the 
authority of the Hindu kings. It is foolish to think of any 
order by the Smritis which claimed to follow the Vedic cult, 
banning sea-voyage at this time. The greatest conquerors 
of all the quarters like the Emperor Rajendra Chola were 
strict followers of the Vedic cult, and took for themselves the 
title, 'Trisamudreshwar'—ruler of the three seas—as that 
of "Samrat" in the north. 
SEA VOYAGE AND FETTERS 
630-533. The verse, fra*^ ^STn'T ^ q^'...cited 
above indirectly points to the reason why helpless Hindu 
law givers** of later days, labouring under political slavery, 
were obliged to clamp this ban on the voyage of the three 
seas in the South. The reason which actuated in the north 
the prevention of crossing the Indus into the lands beyond 
was no other than the religious persecution of the Hindus by 
alien religious fanatics. In order that the insertion into the 
old original smritis of new precepts and bans, calculated to 
meet the critical situations arising in future, might be possible, 
a new concept of the deterioration of the age and the chapter 
on rules of conduct prescriced in the ^fesfsq SRRTJI was cleverly 
adopted. It is needless to say that this concept of the 
deterioration of the age and the theory of i(iRi<fs4 things did act- 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 
ually affect adversely the immutability of the old smritis. But such an indirect change, in the best interests of the society, was unavoidable for the religious law-givers of the times, who sometimes modified or enlarged some old precepts while they introduced some altogether new ones. The verse, tki^*\ etc., which occurs in most of the smritis mentioned above, bears out this remark very clearly. It is only in the smritis compiled or edited in this Smrityite fashion after the periods of Maharshi Deval and Acharya Medhatithi that the unequivocal ban on sea voyage, denying every sort of redemp­ tion for one undertaking sea voyage, and making illegal the acceptance of such a person into his original religion or caste, seems to have been enforced strictly. This period synchroni­ zes with the preponderance of Christians, more particularly the Portuguese, in our Western Sea with the Portuguese persecution and proselytization of the thousands of Hindus in Gomantak (Goa) and with the Arab occupation of Java, Sumatra and Indo-China and the wholesale violent conver­ sion of the Hindu-Buddhist population of those lands. This was the period when the sea-faring Hindu-Buddhist states of the greater Indian empire, staunchly supported by the gallant navies of the Cholas and the Pandyas along with the whole of Southern India fell devastated before the Muslim might. It was the same period when the Hindu ships stopped visiting those distant states, and the Hindus lost all contact with them. It was the most miserable, the most wretched period in the religious and political life of the Hindu nation. Naturally, this must have been the period when the ban on sea-faring was strictly and universally clamped on the Hindus. And it is only in the latest smritis of this period, let it be remembered, that the verses about the ban on the crossing of Attock and that on sea-faring are to be found ! 
534. It is clear from the above-mentioned state of things that it is only when every Hindu rover crossing any of the three Indian seas had to fall a prey to the rapacious Muslim or Christian crocodiles, with no Hindu power overlord­ ing the sea any longer to protect him from that tragic fate. 
210 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
It was with this noble intention of protecting the Hindu society, that their foremost leaders had to issue this ban— this order not to cross the seas on any occasion. 
535. A nation, which is obliged to suffer all sorts of humiliation heaped on its natives and the adherents of the native religion (one which is obliged to see helplessly foreign Muslim or Christian religions imposed on pain of death upon its people and which sadly lacks the armed might to ward 
•off this disastrous situation, has no other go than forbid its people, of course for self-preservation alone, from going to the enemy lands. 
SELF-IMPOSITION OF THE BAN ON CROSSING ATTOCK OR THE SEAS 
536. The greatest mistake made was that when these various bans were interpolated in the older Smritis as the best means of serving the needs of the particular hour, the spurious verses dealing with these bans were also given the same sanctity, the same authenticity and the same inviol­ ability by stamping them with the old authoritative seal of 
W ?R7ciJi: ('This is the old tradition') as was given to the genuinely old verses. That is why even after the particular adverse times, for which these bans on crossing Attock or the sea were originally designed, had passed off and more favourable times prevailed in as much as when the Hindu military might under the Peshwas and Ranjit Singh was powerful enough not only to cross Afghanistan but even attack Persia, this anti-national blind faith in those bans, however, did not vanish.. It was still balking the credulous Hindu Society, with the fear of committing a sin in crossing Attock*®. That means even when the once beneficial religious tradition had grown harmful to the nation the Hindu Society was not prepared to give it up immediately for fear of the religious injunction. Even when to break that tradition would have definitely proved greatly advantageous to the nation and holy from the religious point of view, the blind faith in the old tradition that to break the old custom was 6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 211 
to commit a sin was still maintained. It is, therefore, the seal 'J^ SERT^:'. which the modern writers of Smritis affixed to these later interpolations and which acted as a bugbear, that played the greatest mischief. 
537. Take for instance the ban on sea-faring ! Had these writers of Smritis of later times specifically mentioned that in old'Krit yug'our Arya nation was mighty enough to cross the (seven) seas and rule over other islands and archipelagos, that even up to the time of Rajendra Chola we were the lords of the three seas ((^91^*?%) and that as such crossing the seas was essential for the spread of our religion and empire and holy; but that as the naval power and the lordship of the seas had now been unfortunately lost, cross­ ing the seas and going into the enemy land in a helpless humble way was highly injurious to our nation, and so sinful; and that it was, therefore banned till we regained that lordship of the seas. Had they but said so in so many words ! 51 f raig^'Rr: should really be construed as ^Hcl fieig^TO." 
'because of the loss of might'. The bug-bear of ^^ ^v;: should be truly held up only to that extent. Had (once again we repeat) the writers of Smritis of that time announ­ ced this clearly, the tremendously harmful consequences of these bans on crossing Attock and the seas, which the nation had to suffer , could have been avoided to a lorge extent. 
538. But because the new precepts about the various ibans on crossing Attock and the seas and others, which were really introduced in the chapter on ^fBr^sq things by the new religious law-givers of later days, were published under the name of the old writers of Smritis, they were to remain in force till the end of the qilergiT (Kaliyug) /.e.permanantly. Although later on breaking these bans itself would have proved advantageous to the Hindus and although the Hindus had become strong enough to break them, it was impossible that the credulous Hindu Society would ever have been prepared to break them till the doomsday qsi^f^Rr (the end of 
•^(§151) because of the specific Smriti order 'these five should be abandoned in Kaliyuga f^^i^^ )^''- Again when did 
212: SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
the (qifegji) Kaliyug begin ? How long was it to last ? And 
when was it to end ? And after its end, when was the Age 
of Truth ( H ??^) to commence once again ? The different 
opinionsBi held on these points by many of our religious 
law-givers made the confusion worse confounded. 
THE CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS OFFENSIVE 
AGAINST THE HINDUS ! 
539. In paragraph 399 of this book is mentioned the 
antiquity of the first Hindu contacts with the Christians. 
A c c o r d i n g t o t h e C h r i s t i a n m y t h o l o g y , w h e n i n t h e first, 
century A.D. the Christian religion began to be preached in 
Syria, the very Jews who had crucified Jesus of Nazareth began 
to persecute these handful of Christians. At that very time 
some of the Christians who knew the way to India, fled in 
groups to seek shelter with the Hindu King of Malabar^* 
Zomorin (the corrupt form of Samudriya). As a matter of 
fact, that Hindu King ought not to have unconditionally 
allowed these alien people to land on his sea-coast. But being 
afflicted by the disease of the morbidly erroneous conception 
of virtues, that Hindu king offered shelter to those Syrian 
Christians, and allocated a separate tract for their habita­ 
tion. He even went to the length of offering a copper-plate 
(awia) inscription ! recognizing their equality of right^' as a. 
separate caste in the gram-panchayat (town-council). B u t 
later on when these Syrian-Christians came to know that even 
if the Hindus were forced merely to eat or drink with them 
they would be polluted and could become Christians, these 
ancient Syrian Christians made an inauspicious start of the 
spread of Christianity in India. Whereas during the first 
Christian century (1st Century A.D.) not a trace of Christi­ 
anity could be found in England itself, in India Hindus had 
already begun to bo forcibly baptized and made Christians ! 
(It is worth while for every Hindu to read the history of the 
spread of Christianity in those days. Moreover, it seems that 
the customs and codes of conduct which were likely to 
facilitate the enemy in the work of proselytization were 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 213 
firmly rooted in us as the basic religious conduct even as far back as the first century A.D. But we will leave this topic alone for want of space at our disposal and because it has little bearing upon the subject in hand. 
540. However, we should like to refer to one pregnant instance here. On seeing that a number of Hindu people in a town used to bathe in a holy lake, some of those Syrian- Christian missionaries thought that even here, they could try the device of polluting and Christianizing the Hindus, who considered themselves polluted by merely eating food or drinking water with the Christians. With this intention these Syrian Christian missionaries stealthily went to big lakes where Hindu people used to go in large numbers for a bath and for carrying drinking water home. They bathed there along with all and drank its water. Then after some days these very missionaries themselves declared loudy in their congregations^*, "0 you Hindus ! We are Christians, the followers of Jesus ! We are not Hindus ! We have been bathing in your lakes along with you. After worshipping our Christian god we drink the holy water of the Christian religion and have been giving you the same water all these days and you drank it devoutly. As per your Hindu religion whichever Hindu drinks the Christian water becomes a Christian for life. This is your religious injunction, so you all have become Christians. That your other brethren may not be deceived, we pious people are publishing this truth !" This news spread among the Christians and the Hindus of several villages in no time. There was a great havoc every­ where ! All those Hindus became impure and so they began to be boycotted. In the usual way, all those villages and towns in course of time were socially ostracized and became Christian villages and towns ! 
541. Now we shall cite just for fun—but fun that kills —another incident showing how all the human races at that time were fanatics in the extreme. 
541-A. The early Syrian Christian migrants to India were also divided into different sects. They vied with one 
214 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
another as to which of them disseminated the Christian doctrine more truly in foreign countries. So the sects other than the one which had Christianized Hindu villages, protes^- ted against the latter and out of malice informed the superior religious authorities in Europe that that sect had converted the simple and foolish Hindus^^ to Christianity by abominable lies and deception, and collected contributions, but had never preached any Christian doctrines as such. Therefore, they pleaded, the number of the converts should not be taken into account, and that they should be stopped from damag­ ing the prestige of the Christian propagandists. Because of the incessant protests of these other Christian sects, those Hindu converts to Christanity had for a long time no legal status as Christians, although they thought themselves to be such, and their subscriptions to the Church were not accepted noi" were they allowed entrance into the Church. In the end, the knotty problem seemed to have been solved by way of sumptuous subscriptions. For, after some days a directive^* was received from Europe that all the Hindu con­ verts were now to be called Christians and subscriptions from all of them were necessarily to be collected. Later on all the Christian missionaries, to whatever sect they belonged, dec^ lared it to be their religious duty to convert the Hindus not only by hook or by crook or by sly means, but even by force and armed force. Naturally, the elementary ways of conver­ sion like making the Hindus eat or drink with the Christians were beyond all range of dispute and doubt. 
542. Thereafter the Syrian and other Christians fell out in their own country, and there were fierce battles fought amongst the various Christian sects*'. Therefore, for two or three centuries thereafter the work of the Christian mission­ aries in India had practically stopped. But one thing must be remembered in this context that because there was no attempt whatsoever on the part of the Hindus to reconvert the Chris­ tianized Hindus (Indian Christians) the latter kept on calling themselves Christians and ceased to have any relation what­ soever with the Hindus. 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 215 
543. In this brief account one great proselytizing movement in the fifteenth century deserves some slight reference. That is the rigorous proselytizing movement carried on by the Portuguese missionaries after the passing of Gomantak into the Portuguese hands and the opening of the centres of Christian propaganda on the Malabar coast. Their first energetic and determined archbishop to convert the Hindus by means of any horrible atrocities was Saint Xavier, who came to the land of Gomantak by about A.D. 1540^*. After moving heaven and earth for the spread of Christianity (of course in his horrible way), he wrote several letters to the Emperor of Portugal about the obstacles in his way of proselytization. 
544. In one of his letters to the Portuguese King he complains that the Portuguese officers in India, in spite of the fact that they were Christians themselves, irreverently set at naught his orders in respect of the propagation of their faith. They were entirely given to lustful pleasures and a life of luxury, and were always on the look out for every means to grow rich. Money was their God. To the service of the true God, to which the missionaries like himself had dedicated their lives those officers never did lend any helping hand. "The second necessity for the Christians", he wrote in his letter addressed from Amboina (Moluccas) to D. Joao HI, King of Portugal, on May 16, 1545, "is that Your Majesty establish the Holy Inquisition because there are many who live according to the Jewish law and according to the Mohamedan sect, without any fear of God or shame of the world. And since there are many who are spread all over the fortress there is the need of the Holy Inquisition and of many preachers^®." In one of his letters to the Society at Rome, he wrote, "If it were not for the opposition of the Brahmins we should have them all embracing the religion of Jesus Christ*"." These Brahmins were alleged to hinder the progress of the Christian proselytizing movement. While the Christian missionaries went on converting thousands of Hindus to Christianity, these 'wily' Brahmans were found to 
216 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
be secretly taking them all to the banks of the Mandvi river and bluffed them into bathing in the river. After reciting some verses, in order to w&sh. off all sins of being converted to Christianity, they were declared to be original Hindus. Thus with these and various other blatant lies these Brahmans were alleged to be purifying a number of Hindu converts to Christianity. In spite of all attempts, to intimi­ date and terrorise these Brahmans, they were said to be carrying on their activities nonchalantly". Xavier complains that the Portuguese officers in India did not inflict on these Brahmans such severe punishments as he would have liked them to do. 
545- Tired of these incessant complaints of the Christian missionaries like St. Xavier, the Portuguese Emperor issued stern orders to his Governors and other officers that they should not neglect help in any way in the sacred (?) cause of the spread of Christianity ; otherwise their whole property would be confiscated. Even then not satisfied, St. Xavier went on complaining against the Brahmans. He nevertheless gloated at the tremendous success his proselytizing efforts had achieved**. At the very sight of a Christian missionary, Hindu villages were taken afright and people there were said to be running away helter-skelter, for, most severe were the measures taken against those of the Hindus who did not court Christianity. Let alone the common Hindu villagers, even the high priests of big Hindu temples, the heads of Hindu monasteries and the rich in the cities were all put into prisons and were subjected to so much physical torture that the priestly class at many places is said to have made good their escape to places outside Goa, carrying their sacred idols with them. "Whenever I hear of any act of idolatrous worship", wrote St. Francis Xavier to the Society at Rome, in 1543 A.D., "I go to the place with a large band of these children, who very soon load the devil with a greater amount of insult and abuse than he has lately received of honour and worship from his parents, relations and acquaintances. The children run at the idols, upset 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 217 
them, dash them down, break them to pieces, spit on them, trample on them, kick them about and, in short, heap on them every possible outrage*'." He further wrote to the same society at Rome from Cochin on the 27th Jan., 1545, "When all are baptized, I order all the temples of their false gods to be destroyed and a l l the idols to be broken into pieces**." "The cruelties", writes a Goan Historian, J.C. Barreto Miranda, "which in the name of religion of peace and love this tribunal (of Inquisition) practised in Europe, 
-were carried to even greater excesses in India Every word of theirs (of the Inquisitors) was a sentence of death, and at their slightest nod was moved to terror the vast population spread over the Asiatic regions whose lives fluctuated in their hands and who, on the most frivolous pretexts, could have been clapped for all time in the 
•deepest dungeons or strangled or offered as food for the flames of the pyre**." The harrowing atrocities** of St. Xavier and his successors on the Hindus of his and later dates 
•cannot be described here for want of space. 
546. In all the provinces in north India the Hindus in 
•general had to bear the brunt of the Muslim religious perse­ cution only. But the Hindus to the South of Vindhyadri right up to Rameshwaram had to suffer such horrible persecution n o t o n l y f r o m t h e five i n d e p e n d e n t M u s l i m s t a t e s , t h e n ruling in the Deccan, but also from the even fiercer Portu- 
•guese, whose brutal treatment of the Hindus in order to force them to swear allegiance te the Christian faith, seems to have . 
•no parallel. Whoever wishes to understand the whole harrowing story should read 'Os Hindus De Goa Repnblica Portuguesa', by Dr. Antonio Norohna*". Although many /great and small volumes of histories** describe the horrible religious persecution of the Hindus by these Portuguese missionaries, before which the Muslim atrocities pale into insignificance, this book is particularly mentioned because the writer Dr. Antonio Norohna happened to be a judge of the Portuguese High Court in Goa. The Purtuguese happily iave the honest habit of preserving all the favourable and 
218 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
unfavourable documents regarding their history, right from the ancient to the modern times and it is their ancient tradition to make all these available for study to any inter­ ested scholar. Naturally, he got every facility to read all those documents and books thoroughly, completely and publicly. That this Portuguese judge of the High Court should write this book after thoroughly studying all the documents, including the original letters of the then ruling Portuguese Emperor, the Portuguese Christan missionaries at that time in India, and the then Pope of Rome, is the special merit of this book ! 
547. Besides this book of Dr. Antonio Norohna, one is also recommended to read 'The History of Reconversion in Gomantak'*® in Marathi. It was written under the supervision of the late Shree Masurkar Maharaj who reconverted more than ten thousand Hindus formerly made Christian under great coercion. The present book 'Sis Glorious Epochs' is not really a history of India, but a critical treatise. So the detailed account of this Portuguese religious persecution and forcible conversion of Hindus cannot be given here at length. It is enough to say that the detailed discussion (which has, here been recorded in the earlier chapters) of the thousand- year-old unprecedented and bitter Hindu-Muslim war since the invasion of Sindh by the Muslims and the suicidal consequences of the various harmful and anti-national bans self-imposed by the Hindus on eating, drinking, touching, intermarrying and especially that on repurification and reconversion of the polluted Hindus and many other foolish religious concepts of the Hindus of the time, is applicable, almost word by word, to the various acrimonious battles of the Hindus with the Portuguese after their arrival in India and the Christian missionaries in general and the Christian nations also. 
548. It must also be remembered here that at this very time the Arab and the Christian nations established their rule over the South Sea (the Indian Ocean). They attacked our old Hindu-Buddhist states which had spread far and 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 219 
wide up to Indo-China and deprived millions of Hindus of their religion, causing the Hindus, indirectly, to fetter them­ selves with the new shackles of the ban on sea-voyageTM. This not only worsted the Hindu political and religious authority, but caused a great loss to them of their grand aspiration, for the naval empire and foreign trade. They lost their whole navy and naval trade. Not only did the ship-building industry of the Hindus perish but to maintain such sea-faring naval force itself became sinful. Hindu religion and Hindu nation became literally narrow-minded because of its own blunders. Even if any daring Hindu tried to break this shell of narrow-mindedness on the Eastern, Western and Southern oceans there was the prohibitive placard : I %^ <h ll" This was inviolable. 
549. Heretofore we have mentioned only some of the chosen events, violent or non-violent, regarding the Muslim- Christian two-foid political and religious armed aggression against the Hindus, and the way in which chey faced it ; and even of the revenge that the Hindus also took of those atro­ cities and humiliations during this violent thousand-year-old Hindu-Muslim war. They can easily show according to the '^sft 3$!]* (judging cooked rice by testing one cooked grain only) the enormity of the struggle. 
650. Truly speaking, while religious leaders like Shan­ karacharya Vidyaranyaswami, national heroes like Chhatra- pati Shivaji, Durgadas Rathod, Maharaja Jaswantsingh of Jodhpur and saints and sages, like Ramanand, Shree Chaitanya and others gave the lead in carrying on counter- offensives on the religious front by individual or mass conversions, the Hindu society as a whole, ought to have rocked the skies by effecting unceasing mass conversions of the Muslim men and women to Hinduism and reconversion of Hindu converts who had fallen victim to the violence or guile of the enemy. They should have thrown to the winds the old traditional views and customs. They ought to have made it the religion of the day ! 
550-A. The Hindus were not averse to idolatory. Many 
220 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
of the Hindu sects and many of the Hindu religious tenets had been established by great personalities, and the Hindu society as a whole had recognized them and adapted them to the framework of their religious code, at least so far as they concerned their followers. In their own individual capacity the followers of those particular religious heroes obeyed those particular codes of conduct. But the otherwise, highly idolatrous Hindu society did not follow these new idols—the new heroes—who effected individual and mass conversions and reconversions, carried on equally violent religio-political counter-offensives. They avenged the humiliation and perse­ cution of the Hindu women on the Muslim women by similar treatment. The national heroes who did all this have all along been highly honoured and worshipped as idols among the Hindus, yet the way they showed, as the most suitable for the age, was not actively and enthusiastically followed after they had passed away. As soon as those heroes died their particular followers relegated to oblivion their practical lessons of violent or non-violent religious counter-aggression and their teaching in this respect'^. Why, while the parti­ cular sects of Chaitanya and others have been still alive so far as the other aspects of their teachings are concerned and their eulogistic biographies like the *if^ ^sm have been written and read most devoutly, not the slightest mention of the armed revenge these very heroes took against the Muslims is to be found in them. Does it not sound very strange ? Nor is any heroic ballad seen to have been compo­ sed on their counter-aggression or on their mass reconversions by any of the minstrels or bards or 'Charans' of those days! The Hindu society in general felt no urgency of handing down to the later generations the anecdotes and legends of those heroic deeds.

552. Whatever instances we have quoted of the Hindu religious counter-aggressions so far in this Chapter are of course, only exceptions considering the many centuries of the Hindu-Muslim epic war. They were inadequate attempts to patch up the shattered firmament. But it is because some Hindus performed brave deeds, befitting the valour of the Hindu nation, of retaliation to the Muslims on the religious front that the Hindu side was not completely overthrown. The Muslim enemy always feared that even the Hindus also could avenge religious persecution on occasions. If without losing any time the whole Hindu society had adopted the same military strategy on the religious front as these excep­ tions of Hindu heroes did in launching counter-offensives, not a single Muslim could have remained as a Muslim in this country—at least at that time. This we have often shown in earlier chapters of this book. 
553. But then why didn't all the other Hindus dare do so ? Why were they afraid ? Why did they feel it to be against their Hindu religion itself to launch such armed counter-offensive against the Muslims ? Why did they come to consider the various bans on repurification, sea-voyage, eating and drinking and others as the true religious codes of conduct for the Hindus ? The answer to all these questions— the justification of their conduct—the Hindus of those times offered, was that such an armed retaliation would not have been beneficial to the best interests of the Hindus, nor did it become the Hindu civility—Hindu culture ! They meant to say that in those times of repeated terrific Muslim onslaughts if the Hindu kings and society had reconverted their unfor­ tunate brethren who were converted to Islam, or would have launched counter-attacks on the religious front and again, as we have suggested, converted the Muslim men and women to Hinduism the Muslims would have been still more enraged and again and again in their fresh attacks they would have 
222 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
wrecked far more appalling vengeance on the Hindus. It was this fear, they said, that prompted the Hindus to accept, as an exceptional code of conduct suitable for the adverse circumstances, those various bans and the morbidly perverted concept of virtues which amounted really to abject surrender'*. 
563-A. So in order to refute these and other illogical arguments and to support our arguments and opinions and the various references we have made in the foregoing dis­ course we shall cite another event which will go to prove conclusively our inference that the HINDUS HAD THE ABILITY AND STRENGTH TO LAUNCH ARMED COUN­ TER-OFFENSIVES EVEN ON THE RELIGIOUS FRONT B U T T H E Y H A D N O T T H E W I L L T O D O SO ! 
554. That event is the Maratha war with the Muslims in the South which destroyed Tipu Sultan ! 
CHAPTER X I 
TIPU SULTAN, THE SAVAGE 
555. Towards the middle of the eighteenth century, the Maratha Empire had become so extensive and so powerful as to have brought about the de facto overthrow of the Moghul Empire at Delhi. The Hindu power had no Muslim rival state to oppose it effectively throughout the length and breadth of India, right from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari. But at this very time, Hyder-alli, an ordinary Muslim soldier had been gradually rising to power in the army of the Hindu State of Mysore, and had already become quite indispensable^. Even after the sad experience of centuries together how the very Muslim servants in whom the Hindu Kings had placed complete confidence and whom they had brought to pros­ perity and power, had betrayed those very Hindu masters most treacherously* ever since the times of Mahmud of Ghazni and Ghori, this Hindu King of Mysore, committed the same blunder. Because of his usual artless, and almost unwise attitude of equality to all religions, which was imbibed assiduously amongst the Hindus in general. King Chikka Krishnaraj Vodyar or more particularly his Chief Minister, Nanjeraj, entrusted the supreme military command' to this fanatical Muslim adventurer, Hyder-alli. The consequences were inevitable. Hyder-alli set aside Chikka Krishnaraj Vod­ yar, with a little pension and usurped the throne of Mysore*. He once marched against the Marathas also, but was so sorely beaten by them on the battle-field that he dared not give it a second trial again*. He had also once attacked the English at Madras successfully. But as we are not concerned here with the other activities' of his, it would be sufficient simply to add that after his death in 1782' he was succeeded to the throne of the Hindu State of Mysore by his equally 
224 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
unscrupulous adventurer of a son, Tipu Sultan ! 
556. As soon as he came to the throne, Tipu wiped out even the name of the original Hindu King and proclaimed himself the Sultan of a Moslem state* 1 Tipu was the last of the Muslim rulers to establish a new independent state and style himself a Sultan during the millennial Hindu- Muslim war. 
557. True to the usual Muslim tradition, Tipu perfor­ med his first duty as a Sultan of announcing publicly in the very first session of his court (Darbar) that he would see to it that all the Kafirs were made Muslim willy nilly®. He commanded all the Hindus in his state to embrace Islam. He ordered his various oflScers of high and low ranks in every city, town and village to convert every Hindu to Islam. If the Hindus did not willingly take to Islam, they were to be forced to do so, or else the men were to be slaughtered and the women were to be distributed as slaves among the Muslims!". 
558-560. This campaign by Tipu of pollution and prose­ lytization of the Hindus was so thorough and ruthless and it was carried to such vast dimensions that there was universal wailing and a sense of unimaginable horror throughout the Hindu community in the state". Not only the soldiers in his army but even the Mulla-Moulavis in the meanest of villages, too, with the Muslim hooligans and rufBans to help them, began a systematic persecution of the Hindus ! At a later date Tipu invaded Malabar and at the first stroke converted!* a hundred thousand Hindus in that one single coastal district. Then overtaking the Karnatak he even marched on the Maratha territory!*. Millions of Hindus from Dharwar to Travancore were horror-stricken and hundreds of men and women from all castes and sects of the H i n d u society feeling thoroughly incapable of facing this armed attack of the Muslims preferred death, by drowning themselves i n the K r i s h n a and the Tungbhadra, to a l l the indignities and atrocities of Muslim vandalism. Hundreds of others leapt into the fire,!* bat did not become Muslims ! 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 225 
TIPU'S ARROGANT PROCLAMATION ! 561. Puffed up by the speedy success of his atrocious aggressions upon the Hindus and diabolically elated at their miserable plight, Tipu once proudly declared in his court that his campaign of mass-conversion of the Hindus was accomplished beyond all expectations. On one occasion he said fifty thousand Hindus in his Kingdom were converted hardly within twenty-four hours ! No other Muslim Sultan before him, he proudly stated, could have achieved that stupendous success, but that by the grace of Allah he had been able to perform that amazing task of the spread of Islamic faith and the total annihilation of the Kafirs^* ! 
562. In order to carry on this prodigious task Tipu formed a special division, of his army which surpassed all other Muslim soldiers in enormity and vandalism. He manned it by the pick of the bitterest enemies of the Hindus and most lovingly called them his own sons. Whoever of those loving sons of his did some exceptionally brutal act of ravaging Hindu women, of forcibly converting Hindu families,, of plunder and arson, []or of wholesale massacre was reward­ ed with the youngest and most beautiful of the thousands of Hindu girls captured from different parts of the State^*. 
563. The whole of the Muslim-world was, no doubt, overcome with the highest gratitude to Tipu Sultan for his unprecedented success in the violent propagation of the Muslim faith. He was honoured as Gazi^', the hero of the Islamic faith by his Muslim brethren all over. Naturally the whole of the Muslim community was thus a party to this fanatical persecution of the Hindus by Tipu. Especially the whole of the Muslim society from Karnatak to Travancore which had collectively but actively participated in these atrocities richly deserved punishment from the Hindu standpoint. 
NOW AT POONA 
564. Now on hearing the piteous cries and heart­ breaking screams of the persecuted Hindus of Mysore, there 
226 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
arose a Violent surge of fury at Poona, the capital of the Maratha Empire, which was duty-bound to defend Hinduism. The Maratha diplomats and war-lords decided forthwith to invade Mysore in order to crush this new demon of a Sultan in the South. The Chief Administrator of the Peshwas, Nana Phadnavis" issued an instant order to all the available Maratha chieftains to march on Tipu from all sides with huge 
•armies. 
WAR WITH TIPU 
565. Tipu was extremely annoyed to learn that the Maratha forces were proceeding against him. So before the main Maratha battalions could arrive to their rescue, he mali­ ciously attacked Nargund and Kittur^* in quick succession. These two very small Hindu states were very close to Mysore and far detached from the Maratha territory. 
566. Tipu hated all the Hindus, yet more vehemently the Brahmins who were foremost in trying to kindle in the Hindu Society a burning pride for their religion and self-respect. He had reached the limit of his brutality in persecuting the Brahmins more than any other caste of the Hindus. The great historian, Sardesai, writes, "Brahmins v/ere singled out for special indignities by Tipu^®." The rulers of Nargund and Kittur were both Brahmins'" and both of them had spitefully*^ declined his demand for immediate surrender. Furiously, t h e r e f o r e , d i d T i p u m a r c h first o n N a r g u n d a n d t h e n o n Kittur at the head of a very powerful army**. The ruler of Nargund, Bhave, fought bravely to the bitterest end but for want of any timely assistance from Poona, his small army was easily vanquished*'. The moment the city of Nargund fell, Tipu like a hungry wolf, rushed straight to the ruler's palace, his Muslim army burning and plundering the citizens and their houses. There he arrested the ruler, Bhave, him­ self and his valiant minister, Pethe, and put heavy fetters on their hands and feet. They and their relatives, their families and friends were all subjected to unbearable torture. The brutal humiliation Tipu himself inflicted on the royal 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 227 
ladies in the palace and caused his followers to perpetrate elsewhere in the city is beyond all description ! The young and fair ones of the royal ladies were first put to inhuman torture and then brutally ravished. Tipu locked in his harem the exceptionally beautiful young lady from the royal family and took her to his capital. The sight of the inhuman and disgraceful treatment meted out to her daughters and daugh­ ters-in-law, nieces and grand-daughters broke the heart of Pethe's grand old mother and she died instantaneously. 
567. Tipu's army too spared no pains in torturing and violating the Hindu men and women in the city of Nargund and plundered to their fullest satisfaction the palatial resi­ dences of the wealthy Lingayats as also every single house of the commonest of Hindu citizens. Pinally, setting fire to their houses, Tipu carried away the select Hindu men and women as abject slaves**. 
568. Tipu next fell violently on the other Hindu state of Kittur and stamped it out of existence in like manner. He himself repeated and made his army repeat to the latter all the infernal outrages, which were performed at Nargund, 
•on the Kittur ruler, his family, all the men and women in his pay and all the people in the city**. 
569. By this time the main body of the Maratha army was advancing rapidly reconquering the regions and cities formerly subjugated by Tipu. Skipping over the other details of this campaign on Tipu, which are not quite pertinent to the topic in hand, we think it quite sufficient to say that in the end Sardar Patwardhan, Phadke, Behare Holkar, Bhonsale and other Maratha chieftains routed the Muslim armies of Tipu on various battle-fields and after rescuing the whole of Karnatak** pressed him back up to Mysore and there encircled him into a tight grip ! Snatching this opportunity of Tipu's distress, the English at Madras too marched on him. As the strokes of the Maratha swords and the thrusts of their spears began to make bloody incisions on the back of Tipu's religious fanaticism, the devil in him began to relent and his haughtiness began to temper 
228 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
down. Tipu grew despondent. 
AND THEN TIPU FELL AT THE FEET OF 
HINDU GODS 
570. Whether to appease the Marathas or to win back the millions of Hindus groaning sorely under the yoke of his religious persecution, Tipu all of a sudden began to make munificent grants to Hindu temples*'. He even had new idols ceremoniously installed*' in the big temples formerly smashed to pieces by his own Muslim hirelings. He requested the Hindu Brahmins** to pray to their gods in various Hindu temples that he might get success in this war with the Marathas. In order to please the very Brahmins whom he hated most bitterly and tortured mercilessly he now paid them large sums of money'". He had ceremonial prayers made. He himself paid great homage to Shree Shankara- charya'! (of Shringeri) to avert the imminent calamity, asked for his blessings, which the great man readily gave'*. Tipu not only attended the Chariot-festival of certain Hindu gods at Kanchi, but he himself walked in the festive procession. With his own hands he ignited the fire-works" to heighten the festive spirit of the occasion. 
DEMONS WORSHIP GODS 
571. It is said that even devils start worshipping those gods who have the weapons powerful enough to destroy the enemy. 
But neither God nor Devil came to save the wicked Tipu from that calamity and at last after two or three expeditions the Marathas and the English forces subjuga­ ted the whole of his kingdom. Tipu himself was killed in 1799, and his dominions were divided. The small portion formerly belonging to the Hindu King of Travancore was returned to him and the original royal family of the Vodyars was reinstalled at Mysore. Some of the remaining territory was taken over by the English, while the large tract from Karnatak to the Tungbhadra river was annexed by the 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 229 
Marathas to their empire. All the Hindu states, which he had vowed to wipe out at the time of his accession to the throne, began once again to rule peacefully in their own places. If any one was totally ruined, it was Tipu himself with all his Muslim territory. 
HINDUS' SUCCESS 
572. Thus the violent religious aggression under Tipu's leadership, which the Muslims in South India had launched and perpetrated with a crescendo against the Hindus during the two decades or so immediately preceding the year A.D. 1790 was heroically and successfully put down by the Hindus politically as well as on the battle-field. 
MUSLIMS GAIN 
673. Maratha warriors, claiming to defend Hindu reli­ gion, smashed the Muslim military and political might as has been already described. But they did not simultaneously deal any counter-blow to their religious front in order to repulse and avenge their all-out attempt to disrupt Hinduism, their mass-conversions of Hindus, their most heinous attacks upon the chastity of thousands of Hindu women. They did not severely penalize the perpetrators of these crimes. No, they did not do anything of the kind to attack the Muslim religion in return ! 
THE RESULT 
674-676. The inevitable consequence was that the two or three hundred thousand forcibly converted Hindu men and women and children remained groaning with agony in the clut­ ches of the Muslim community in South India. Although Tipu's political power perished completely under the heavy counter­ blows of the combined Maratha-English swords and spears, the religious domination he forced on the millions of Hindus grew ever stronger and stronger in the absence of any counter- offensive. The future generations of these converted Hindus, in the absence of any immediate reconversion, went on adding 
230 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
rapidly to the numerical strength of the enemy of Hinduism by at least one and a half times or twice as much. Being brought up from birth under the Islamic influence, this future progeny of the Hindu converts became the inveterate enemies of the Hindus and instead of desiring to come back to Hinduism they cherished, like the -wolf in the 'Aesop's fables', the fiendish ambition of converting the rest of the Hindus to islam. They considered it their most sacred duty ! 
576. If the Marathas had so retaliated, all those two or three hundred thousand Hindu men and women recently converted, during those four or five years of the war with Tipu, would have, in all probability, courted Hinduism most willingly, because of the love they bore for their original families and relatives and because of the pangs of separation that they suffered. Their devotion to and fascination for their recently lost religion, their love and affection for their separated Hindu fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, relatives and friends must have at that time been so acute and fresh as to cause them many a heart-ache and to make them shed many an agonized tear at their slightest mention and recollection. 
577. How very simple it would have been, at that time, to reconvert all those luckless two or three hundred thousand Hindu brethren and absorb them all in the Hindu society ! 
578. After Tipu's defeat, the victorious Maratha armies of Sardar Patwardhan, Holkar, Baste and other great chief­ tains were returning triumphantly to Maharashtra from their respective fronts and by different routes. Their multiple infantry, cavalry and artillery brigades were gaily fluttering their saffron-coloured banners and rending the skies with their war-cry 'Har Har Mahadev !' And in those very districts, towns and cities of Mysore, Karnatak and Mahara­ shtra through which these warriors paraded their victorious exultation, lay rotting and slaving in various Muslim houses', the thousands of abducted H i n d u women while men equally large in numbers, were leading a miserable life of shame and remorse for their forced conversion to Islam. The exultant 6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 231 
war cries of 'Har Har Mahadev' of these Hindu warriors, following closely the glad news of victory and the downfall of the Muslim state of Mysore, must have informed them of the triumphal march of the Maratha conquering armies through their own towns, villages and cities. How eagerly these unfortunate Hindu converts—and especially the women —must have hastened to crowd the windows, doors, fissures and small openings of those Muslim prison-like houses and cottages to have at least a fleeting glimpse of those martial processions ! And how keenly must their sorely afflicted hearts have felt the happy yet acutely painful pangs of intense expectation of imminent deliverance from those Satanic Muslim dungeons and confines ! "At last—at long last—they have come !" they might have said to themselves, "Our/my-Hindu brothers have come trampling down the wicked hearts of the Muslim tyrants to deliver us from their abject servitude !" On occasions some of them might have very probably seen their own fathers or brothers or husbands or relatives or at least some neighbours proudly strutting through the streets in their triumphal marches ! 
THE LACK OF WILL 
579. On such occasions if only these proudly marching military detachments of Hindu warriors had simply willed it, they could have, in no time, set free those thousands of miserable Hindu men and women rotting in Muslim bondages They could have simply gone on doing it just as they passed along the streets ! So simple the whole thing really was. But...! 
580. For, at that time the Muslims, neither individually nor collectively had any courage or strength left in them to oppose the triumphant Hindu army. At the approach of the Maratha soldiery, the Mulla-Moulavis and the rogues, knaves and brigands were at great pains to hide their faces into whichever nook or ditch they could find in order to save their lives. 
580-A. If only one gay blast from the Maratha bugle 
232 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Lad rung out and reverberated through every town and every village assuring the people in some such manner ! "Come, 0 you, Hindu mothers and sisters, come ! You, who have been wickedly polluted and forced to do all sorts of menial and dirty wretched work in the Muslim household, come out, come under our protection ! We, your foster- brothers, have come to your doors in order to rescue you and take you to your respective families. Whichever Muslim comes to obstruct you, dies instantly ! May that Muslim be then a man or a woman, of high rank or low ! Similarly, O you helplessly converted Hindu brethren come, join us when and where you can ; join our conquering brigades ! The moment you gather under this Saffron-coloured Hindu banner, you will have every sort of protection." 
580-B. If only such a reassuring blast was heard and echoed through towns and villages, thousands upon thousands of those ill-fated Hindu converts, men and women, mothers and sisters, would all have rushed most willingly and of their own accord to join those Maratha warriors. And they all could have been most easily purified and reconverted to Hinduism and the |Muslim religious victory under Tipu's leadership would have been totally nullified. 
BUT ALAS ! NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF THIS ! 
581. Neither those Maratha warriors, nor their commanders, nor the Sardars and Chieftains, nor the Shankaracharyas, nay not even the Peshwa at Poona, nor the Chhatrapatis of Satara and Kolhapur—alas ! not a single Hindu soul ever dreamt of this simple way of reconversion of those ill-starred Hindus ! Nobody of them ever felt ashamed of marching straight ahead without casting so much as a sympathetic glance at the thousands of the brutally ravaged Hindu mothers and sisters ! Their martial drums and pipes proclaimed to the world their military and political victory I The Maratha companies and battalions proudly paraded through the villages, towns and cities supremely unconcerned about the two or three hundred thousand of 
• 5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 233 
their miserable Hindu brethren in Muslim bondage. No, no ! not a single miserable soul was at that time reconverted to Hinduism! 
582. The natural consequence of it all was that those thousands of our brutally converted Hindu mothers and sisters anxiously waiting for the victorious Hindu armies to 
•set them free from those hellish tortures and death-like humiliation in the Muslim prison-like homes must have most probably turned away from the doors and windows in utter 
•despair ! To see none of the soldiers ever caring to recognize and pity them—let alone to rescue and reconvert them-^ must have rent their hearts in two ! They must have resigned themselves helplessly to the Muslim bondage and rotted till 
•death bringing forth Muslim offsprings ! What wonder if they jnight have borne the bitterest grudge against these unavail­ ing Hindu brethren ! 
583. On the other hand, the Mulla-Moulavis and the Muslim hooligans and rogues who had so far disappeared "underground for fear of death very soon came to know that .neither those victorious armies, nor their chiefs, nor even the rulers and administrators of Hindu states were going to punish them individually or collectively for all the wrongs they had perpetrated against the Hindus. Being thus assured -of safety they came out boldly and began to move about freely and enjoy, as their legal right, the abducted Hindu women and the plundered Hindu property as their own. It -also might have happened that many Hindus had the misfortune to witness meekly with their own eyes their own daughters and nieces and daughters-in-law slaving as wives or maids in Muslim houses in their own villages and towns. 
iBut strangely enough neither the Hindu population there 
•nor the Hindu administrators nor again the officers at those -places ever thought of freeing any of those luckless ladies ! Hardly any such instance is recorded in history. For, the Eindus had cultivated a shameless religious conceit for over -centuries together to suffer all the heart-rending humiliation without a prick of conscience. Nobody as a rule is ashamed 
234 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY^ 
of a thing which is not considered blameworthy by the- society. Because of the one ban on reconversion what was: this shameless perversion of ideas and emotions to which the- Hindu society had brought itself! 
A HEAP OF CONTEMPORARY DOCUMENTARY 
EVIDENCE 
584. Abundant information in all details is now- available about this war with Tipu. Histories written in English by Marshman and others, those in Marathi by Rao Bahadur Sardesai and the contemporary correspondence of the then English diplomats, administrators and political' agents and ambassadors have been published. Research, scholars like Rajwade, Parasmis and Khare have brought to light heaps of letters by the Chiefs of the Maratha States, their subordinate officers and ambassadors and agents, of" merchants and men of rank in the society, of various people in political, religious and social walks of life. A clear picture paints itself of the daily routine life of the Hindu Society of the time, its habits and customs, its codes of religious, political and social conduct, its ethics and philosophy, i f one cares to read the dispatches of the great personalities of the times like Haripant Phadke to Nana Phadnavis at Poona about his association with Lord Cornwallis, at the battle of Shreerangpattam against Tipu, those about his high level- discourses on war-moves and treaties, down to the letters^ describing the raids of robbers, and pilgrimages of devout pilgrims, letters of travels and those giving market rates and also those of Shankaracharya complaining about the^ ransacking of his 'Ashram' ! 
585. But no evidence can be generally found in all this, heap of documents to show if anyone was yearning to avenge the Muslim atrocities and their religious victory over the' Hindus. No Hindu commander nor a small troop of soldiers,, nor even a group of men is ever reported to have drawn, swords to rescue the converted Hindu women and to cut. down the Muslim miscreants. No one is reported to have? 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 23a 
felt any shame at the humiliation of these unfortunate 
•women and at the Hindu failure to rescue them. These hundreds and hundreds of letters show a lamentable want of realization—not to speak of any anxiety about it—on the part of the Hindu society, that day by day they were losing, territory and power so far as their religion was concerned. Howsoever strange and sad it might appear the fact cannot be gainsaid. Not a word seems to have been breathed or recorded about the retaliation of the Muslim atrocities—let alone its actual execution ! 
586. We may set aside the whole heap of contemporary documents but we cannot help referring to one letter of Haripant Phadke in particular. The said letter'* was written to Nana Phadnavis informing him of the two sons of Tipu, taken as hostages by the Marathas and the English to ensure the prompt execution of the terms of the treaty, which was signed by Tipu after his defeat. Writes Haripant Phadke, perhaps casually, to show how they had brought Tipu to such a miserably low condition,— 
586-A. "Lord Cornwallis sent the two sons of Tipu to­ me. When I saw them they pleaded they were hungry. I sent them to a neighbouring tent and ordered that they should be well fed. Then after some time they were returned to the English camp of Lord Cornwallis !" 
586- B. The incident referred to in this letter and the one we are shortly going to quote here with reference to the Battle of Kharda hold as it were to a searching analysis under the X-ray the perverted sense of virtues which had permeated, through centuries, to the marrow of the Hindu society, rendering it slovenly and inbecile and insensible to. all sorts of shameful humiliation. 
587- 588. Haripant Phadke's genial treatment of Tipu's two sons reminds us of another incident which by contrast will give us a practical illustration of our discussion of the perverted Hindu sense of virtues in paragraphs 405 to 471. 
588- A. In the first or the second decade of the seven­ teenth century the tenth Guru of our Hindu-Sikhs, Dharmveer 
236 SfX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Shree Govindsing found it impossible to continue the war with the Moghuls. He was at last besieged in the fort of 
•Chamkaur'* along with his sons. Overcome with terror, some of his sworn disciples from the Sikh army conspired to desert their Guruji, renounce their Sikh religion and left the fort secretly. Two elder sons of the Guruji were killed before his eyes in the battle. At last in the face of such grave danger the Guruji advised all to leave battle and run for life wherever they could. Finding a suitable opportunity he made good his own escape. But in that confusion two of his sons, of a tender age of 12 or below, missed the way and fell into the Muslim hands'*. How did the Muslims treat them according to THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS CODE ? 
589. The Letter of Haripant Phadke referred to above shows how kindly and sympathetically, according to THEIR 'OWN RELIGIOUS CODE, the Marathas treated the two sons of Tipu when they came into their hands. 
590. On the contrary, as soon as the brave cubs of Guru Govindsing fell into the Muslim hands they were taken straight to their war council and asked "Are you willing to be Muslims ? If so, you will be given your life and everything you want. Otherwise nothing !" The children answerd : "We won't be Muslims even if our life is not spared" !" Immedi­ ately the diabolic Muslim justice decreed that the two small children be forthwith built alive in a brickwall! While they were thus being built in they were asked, as each brick was placed on the wall, "Do you become Muslims ?" The two brave Hindu cubs would reply again and again "No we won't be Muslims !" The last brick was laid on the heads 
•of both the young martyrs and they ceased to breathe ! Even today if a true Hindu enters the vicinity of that scene 
•of martyrdom he will very likely hear the words reverbera­ ting the whole atmosphere there : ''I won't become a Muslim : nay, not at all! I am a Hindu, I am a Sikh ! I bravely court death" !" 
591. Supposing that by an adverse turn of events two 
•children of our Peshwas were to fall in the hands of Tipu 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 23T 
or any other Muslim ruler—what then ? He would not have fed, as the Hindu-hearted Haripant Phadke did, the two tender-aged children and returned them to the Peshwa !' Such a behaviour would have been considered sacrilegious and cowardly according to the Muslim religious belief; they would most probably have been built up a alive in brick- walls or else would have been crushed under an elephant's foot. The Hindus, on the other hand, would not have avenged such brutality with any hyper-brutal retaliation,, even if they had had the strength and opportunity to do so. For, the virus of the perverted sense of virtues had been flowing through their arteries and veins for centuries, together. 
592. It should be made clear at this very stage that the ethics of war which demanded that a charioteer must fight with another charioteer only, the sword should meet another sword alone, that the armed warrior ought not to fight with an unarmed one, till he has been armed equally, that a fallen, senseless warrior was never to be attacked till he had regained consciousness etc. etc'*, was perhaps quite suitable for the ancient times before Mahabharat. For both the contending parties obeyed the same set of rules : both worshipped the same ethics of war. The Pandawas themselves had violated*", at the instance of Lord Krishna, many of these chivalrous rules of war ! But the Hindus of these middle ages forgot the lesson taught by the Bhagwat Geeta, of giving due consideration to the time, place and person or persons concerned while obeying these rules of war. They on their own part kept on fighting the diabolic Muslim ways of war with the same old—originally sane and civilized but now outmoded and so highlj' suicidal—tactics in war. 
592-A. Besides this incident of Tipu's t\Hi sons, we should like to cite another—equally shameful for the Marathas and the Hindus, inasmuch as it offers another illustration of the perverted sense of virtues of the Hindus of those times I It happened during the Battle of Kharda (1795 A.D.) against the Nizam, the last restlessly writhing remnant of the 
238 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
-Muslim power at Delhi ! The Nizam was at that time completely at the mercy of the Marathas*^; he would have lieen wiped out of existence and saved all further trouble, ljut for the shameless exhibition of this perverted sense of virtues, by the Marathas ! 
593. The Maratha forces with their excellent strategic -moves had encircled the Nizam at such a desolate and dry place that his vast army could get no food or water**. The scarcity of drinking water was so acute that hundreds 
•of Muslim soldiers drank stinking water from dirty pools, not fit even for animals*'. Nizam-alli himself was almost in tears**. And at this most critical moment the big Maratha guns began to rend the skies with their thundering. 
594. But at this most crucial moment the Maratha war cabinet was seized with such a paroxysm of their age-old incurable disease of the perverted sense of virtues v/z., mis­ placed generosity to withhold the strokes and allow time to even the inveterate fainting enemy to regain consciousness, -that had it lasted a little longer, the scales of war would have turned against the Hindus themselves and the Muslims would never have failed to annihilate them completely. At a time when the Nizam himself, the chief enemy of the Marathas, was dying of thirst and when the Marathas luckily had the best opportunity of capturing him alive and of destroying his whole army the Peshwa, Sawai Madhavrao, was inspired with the grand idea** that the true greatness of a warrior was to show mercy to the down-cast enemy. He, therefore, sent, in consultation with his war-cabinet, a very valuable supply of water enough for the Ni^am and his royal family from his own stock of drinking water which was preserved with no less difficulty. And this was done in the thick of the fray—quite consistently with the maxim : g^j 
(Forgiveness is the virtue of the brave).[Remember for a contrast 'The Battle of Samugad or Shambhugad' (1658.A.D) and the siege of Agra by Aurangzeb—Shahajahan was brought to his knees by cutting off the water supply to the fort of Agra**]. 
- 5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 239 
A FINE ILLUSTRATION OF SELF- CONTRADICTION ! 595. A common belief seems to prevail that the Hindus strictly banned any reconversion of Muslimized Hindus or any conversion of born Muslims because they dreaded fresh 
•outrages from the Muslims in India and perhaps new horrible invasions of foreign Muslims resulting in untold monstro- cities and consequent horrible retribution. 
596. It is purposely to show how erroneous, unrealistic and wholly improbable, this belief is that we have quoted the episode the Maratha war with Tipu.which provides ample historical evidence to support all the points we have made so far. 
597. Setting aside that episode of the war with Tipu for a while, it is enough to pose a question : if at all, the -Hindus were so terribly and incessantly obsessed with the 
•dread of Muslim retaliation they would have offered no resistance, howsoever slight it might have been ! They would never have counter-attacked the Muslims on the political and military fronts and won at great odds. For, it is only in those Hindu states which, the Muslims conquered, that 
• such religious persecution of the Hindus was, or would have been, possible for the Muslims. If at all the Hindus were to dread anything they should have dreaded the Muslim armed political aggression first. But barring minor incidents -and looking at this gigantic struggle in one broad sweep, the reader can clearly see that in order to protect their states and religion the Hindus had fought grim and deter- imined battles right from the times of Mahmud of Ghazni's and Ghori's demonical raids. They lost their states, they won their states ! Defeat and victory, victory and defeat ! The fortunes of the fields changed in quick succession ! But for more than seven centuries the Hindus kept on fighting the Muslims throughout the whole of India, fought every inch -of it and finally brought the mighty Muslim enemy to his -inees in abject surrender ! To say that these Hindus would Jiave ever cared a two-pence for the fiercer rage of the Muslim 
240 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
revenge is in itself a fine illustration of self-contradiction ! 
698. Of course, the Muslims had never to worry in the least about the security of their religious domination in India ! The Hindus were firm as regards one thing : never to convert any Muslim, not to counter-attack the sphere of the Muslim religious influence; nor again to harm them in any way in matters religious; for, all these actions were completely contrary to the Hindu religious faith ! The Muslims had only one anxiety as to how to spread the Islamic faith incessantly throughout the length and breadth of India, even if the Hindus had reconquered political power ! We have already discussed at different places in this book the trem­ endous loss to the Hindu nation this Muslim religious aggression had caused. Only two major points need a brief resume here. 
LOSS OF THIRTY MILLION HINDUS 
599. Even in those days the Hindu society was quite aware of this numerical loss ! But because of their morbid ban on reconversion no effective remedy could be found against this drain of its life-blood. Very like the invalid patient meekly bearing the death-pangs of an incurable disease the then Hindu world endured this blood-draining, deadly disease! 
LOSS OF TERRITORY ! 
600. But graver still than this loss of numerical strength was another : the permanent loss of the vast territory snatched away by the Muslim religious incursions, slowly, bit by bit, but steadily, without the knowledge of the Hindus ! THE MUSLIMS THUS SEIZED EAR MORE HINDU L A N D T H R O U G H O U T I N D I A B Y C O N V E R S I O N , T H A N T H E Y D I D B Y C O N Q U E S T S ! 
601. For, twenty to thirty million Hindu converts, and millions of foreign Muslims that flocked to India to seek their fortune, settled permanently in India alone ! The land—the cities and towns and particular parts of cities and 6 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 241 
towns and villages that were inhabited and were to be inhabited by these Muslims and their descendants to come in future—^were permanently lost to the Hindus, never to be regained ! On these tracts and patches of land fluttered non- challantly the green Muslim bands indicating the unimpeded sway of the Muslim religious faith all over ! The Hindus,, and more particularly the Marathas, wrested away practically all the political power throughout the whole of India from the Muslims towards the end of this epic Hindu-Muslim war.. Yet the Muslims retained their hold individually or collectively on the masses and on property too ! 
602. Again as the Muslim population grew rapidly because of polygamy popular amongst them and the spread of their religion by conversion more and more land was to that extent being gradually but surely occupied by them and was passing for ever into the Muslim hands. In order to give some idea of the actual condition it is enough to say that even after the establishment of the de facto sovereignty of the Marathas every little town or village had a separate part known as Musalmanwada or Musalman mohalla ! Why, even cities like Poona, Satara, Kolhapur, Nagpur in Maharashtra, Baroda, Devas, Dhar, Indore, Gwalior and Udaypur in Central India and Jodhpur, Jaipur, Amritsar, Lahore right up to Shreenagar in Kashmir in the north, each had a separate section exclusively colonized by thousands of Muslims and known as 'Muslim-pura' or 'Muslim-abadi'. The Muslims not only dominated these separate sections religiously, but practically became their owners *'! 
603. And the fun of it was that this religious domina­ tion of the Muslims and their individual right to that land had been constitutionally and legally protected by the Hindu kings themselves, giving them equal civil status as subjects along with the Hindus ! Especially because of open and deep- rooted enmity between the Hindus and the Muslims in those days and as change of religion was then tantamount to change of nationality, all the land that passed into the Muslim hands, this way or that, was in reality permanently given over to the national enemy of the Hindus ! 
242 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
604. Thus throughout the whole of India, in every 
•village and town and city and province, big or small Muslim pockets (Muslimistans) were being created and fostered right 
•from those days. That again means that from that time India was being vivisected unwittingly between two parts : the Hindu India and the Muslim India ! 
605. THESE BIG OR SMALL ISLAMISTANS WERE R E A L L Y T H E T I M E B O M B S L A I D B Y T H E C O V E R T M U S L I M R E L I G I O U S A U T H O R I T Y I N T H E F O U N D A T I O N OF THE HINDU POLITICAL SUPERSTRUCTURE ! 
606. Yet neither the Hindu rulers, nor the common people, nor even the historians of the time seem to have apprehended, acutely or even faintly, the instantaneous or the belated consequences of this tremendous loss of numbers and territory. For nobody else has so far tried, as we are doing here, any bold, lucid and comprehensive historical exposition of this loss of numbers and territory that the Hindu nation had to suffer because of the morbid Hindu religious concepts of various bans and their perverted sense of virtues ! If at all there be any such attempt it is bound to be an exception. 
607-608. Moreover, had the Hindus at that time really understood the full significance of the above-mentioned evil consequences of the Muslim religious dominance the Maratha government would have been immediately and definitely launched a counter religious aggression upon the Islamic faith in the south, the moment its leader, Tipu, was politically vanquished. For the Hindus had never before had such a completely favourable opportunity, as they had it then to launch such a counter-offensive on the religious front. Throughout the whole of India there was left no Muslim power at that time which could even so much as think of opposing the Marathas, as we have already pointed it out, and as our contemporary bard sings in one of his heroic ballads with evident pride for Hinduism— 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 243 
[The pirates (meaning the Portuguese), Hyder, the Nizam, the English all were exhausted fighting (with the Marathas) Whoever looked (with enmity) at Poona, lost their wealth !] 
D A V I L C A N B E F O U G H T B Y A R C H - D p V t t O N L Y 
609. Suppose, as soon as this propitious time had comej the Maratha Chieftains like Bhonsale, Holkar, Patwardhan, Baste and others, who had fought against Tipu, the Maratha administrators, the Peshwa and the Chhatrapati, had promulgated, in consultation with the prominent religious authorities, some such order (if not actually couched in the same words) as the following : 
610. "Just as the valour of the Maratha warriors had trampled under their feet the Muslim rule of Tipu, in a 
•similar way, in order to bring to the lowest dust the Muslim religious preponderance under the fiendish Tipu, which has 
•so far inflicted every sort of brutality and humiliation on the Hindus and to chastise those guilty of these heinous crimes, our government has decided to attack in return the Muslims on the religious field. 
611. "Faithfully following the interpretation of the religious law and the religious code of conduct by Shree Shankaracharya Vidyaranyaswami, whose authority is consi­ dered next only to the Very First Shree Shankaracharya by the whole of the Hindu world, we hereby for the first time, propose to break the psychological ban on reconversion which has simply paralysed the Hindu society, so far as the retalia­ tion of the tyrannical Muslim religion is concerned, and we hereby order every single official, of whatever rank, to make the necessary arrangements to enforce the strict observance 
•of the following instructions. 
612. "On learning about the forcible conversion of Hindu men and women in his particular jurisdiction, every village and city-officer shall gather together all such oppres- 
•sed Hindus in some rescue camp under the government protection, and shall attend to all their needs. 
613. "Every several Muslim man and woman in every 
244 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
town and village in whose house or hut Hindu women, girls and children might be found slaving as oppressed converts, shall, along with the whole family, be forthwith fettered and thrown into prison and the miserable Hindu women and children after being immediately set free shall be affectiona­ tely and courteously taken to the rescue camps. 
614. "Similarly the warriors from Tipu's select company of the direst young Muslim scoundrels whom he fondled as his 'sons' shall be fettered with very heavy shackles wherever they will be found in Maharashtra, Karnatak or elsewhere and locked in jails, and the fairest young and innocent Hindu women, who were given away as rewards to those Muslim young rogues from this brigade for their brutal atrocities towards the Hindus, should all be rescued and sent with all civility to the said rescue camps. 
615. "Finally, a national reconversion week will be announced by a Superior Officer, before which all the rescued Hindu converts from the rescue camps all over the particular region shall be conducted in large groups under military guard to the holy places adjoining their native places or to Dharwar or Badami or other places where the oppres­ sive Muslim armies have been destroyed by the Marathas. At all these places shall these oppressed Hindu converts be reconverted to Hinduism en masse. At all these places sacrificial fires should be lit and offerings made for the repuri­ fication of all these millions of Hindu converts and they should all be received in the Hindu Society ceremoniously with chorus-singing of praises for the Hindu religion. All those who are likely to be willingly, lovingly and honourably received by their original families should be escorted to their original homes and rehabilitated in those families. But the thousands of other repurified and reconverted Hindus who may not find such a loving reception in their original sub- castes, should all be classed as a • new warrior class in the structure of the Hindu society—gTpWjigi—a fire race according to the Rajput legend—and all the political and religious authorities in the land are hereby ordered to concede to 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 245 
them all rights due to a Hindu as equitably and justly as the other caste Hindus enjoy. 
616. "Then in order to reward the meritorious services of the choicest Maratha warriors in this Hindu-Muslim war at least as many young and beautiful Muslim girls should be captured, converted to Hinduism and presented to them as were the Hindu girls distributed by Tipu amongst the dare­ devil warriors of his select brigade. 
617. "Thereafter the thousands of Muslim rascals and scoundrels, who have, in this Hindu-Muslim war, inflicted harrowing atrocities on the Hindus, raped Hindu women and girls, have broken holy images of Hindu gods and goddesses and have demolished their temples and who will have been locked as per the above-mentioned order in various prisons, shall be conducted under strong military guard to the four or five chief cities that will be signified later on by the Superior Ofi&cers. They should especially be taken to Nargund and Kittur—the places where Tipu himself had inflicted inhuman atrocities on the Hindu men and women with the aid of his diabolic army, so that Tipu's devilish acts might be aveng­ ed with equal ferocity and with the harshest punishments meted out to the dare-devil soldiers of his Islamic brigade in the very presence of the afflicted people there. On the appoin­ ted day, during the reconversion week, these hundreds of Muslim devils should be brought under strong armed guard of soldiers and cannons to the vast parade-grounds and after the charge-sheets against them, indicating their fiendish acts against the Hindus, have been read out to them, they should be blown off from cannon-mouth, before the joyful eyes of the thousands of Hindu spectators. 
A NATIONAL HOMAGE TO THE HINDU MARTYRS 
618. "In the end this reconversion week should be concluded with a national homage to the report of three volleys of guns from every fort and city of Maharashtra in honour of the thousands of men and women who courted martyrdom by leaping into the rivers like the Krishna or the 
246 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Tungbhadra, or in soiae other ways, because they had no other effective means to save their religion and to escape the direct jersecution at the hands of Tipu's soldiers when thou- sards of them surrounded and blockaded whole towns carrying on wholesale conversions with fire and sword." 
THE ECHOES OF RELIGIOUS RETALIATION 
619. If at all the Marathas had dealt such a crushing counter-blow on the Muslim religious front, the echoes, and re­ echoes of the guns, thundering from every fort in Maharash­ tra, would not have been heard in the valleys of the Krishna and the Tungbhadra alone; they would also have reverberated throughout the Gangetic, the Indus, nay, far beyond it, the Vakshu (Oxus) river-valleys and the whole of the Muslim world. The barest news, that the Hindus, too, had been reconverting the millions of converted Hindus, breaking away the fetters of the ban on reconversion, would have shocked the Muslim world far more fiercely than the report of thousands of guns fired simultaneously, and their very existence would have begun to dwindle. This is not mere historical guesswork, but a guarantee of historical probability. 
620. But this historical probability remained only a probability ! The Hindus never broke the ban on recon­ version, nor did they allow it to be broken. Naturally the Islamic religious dominance in India could not be over­ thrown. 
621. The virus of the caste-differences caused by birth had already permeated the whole blood-system of the Hindu society long before any Muslim aggressor could come to India. Perpetual Muslim atrocities aggravated its effects all the more, and the Hindu Society lost its original susceptibi­ lity to change, its expansionism, its ability to absorb newer elements and its strong inclination to retaliation even in the religious field. How could the Hindu leaders, then, hit back the Muslim foreigners or absorb them in their Hindu Society ? r : • ; ' 'v' • ..: 
6 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 247 
622. "How could a man", they thought, "who was a born Muslim ever become a true Hindu by merely dipping into the Gangetic waters ?" "For," they argued, "the caste is decided by birth." 
623. TT?nT sr^r^TT TfRft^ ^rrsflf i 
^wt %^ II*' ["Even as a donkey washed in the holiest of waters Can never become a spirited horse..." How can we then admit these born non-Hindus to our original castes merely because a certain scented pigment betokening Hinduism is applied to their foreheads ? Are we to dine with them ? And if that person be a woman, are we to marry her simply because an auspicious k u m k u m tilak from a Hindu box is applied to her forehead ? And that too openly ? Impossible ! Impossible ! ! Irreligious ! Irreligious ! I 623-A. Such were the religious ideas of not only the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas, but the Mangs, the Dhors, the Bhils and other so-called 'low castes' and wild tribes too ! They considered this to be the only true Hindu religion. The main principle underlying these ideas of caste-differences Was that whichever Hindu went over to the Muslim fold, willy nilly—whether by persuasion or by- coercion—was pol­ luted and damned—irrevocably damned for life—nay for all his generations to come ! 
623-B. What woder then if hundreds of millions of Hindus who, cherishing such absurd ideas about religious behaviour, had stoutly opposed any reconversion of the oppressed Hindus or of the born Muslims! 
THE ONLY FORTUNATE THING WAS... 624. The only fortunate thing was that at the beginning of the Muslim onslaughts on India no couplet in Anusthup metre was interpolated in some smriti by some Brihaspati (wiseacre) or another banning territorial conquests as others were, in respect of bans on food-exchange, inter-caste marriages, reconversion, sea-faring and many other things t If the forcibly converted Hindu could not be reconverted to 
248 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Hinduism, if a man dealing with a Muslim himself became a Muslim, how could a land or territory once conquered by the Muslims be again a Hindu land ? Whoever tried to win back that lost kingdom would himself become a Muslim ! The land, however, would never become a Hindu land again ! If some learned Hindu fool had argued this way and promul­ gated such a ban on reconquering the lost territory the Hindus would have been rendered as absolutely powerless to overthrow the Muslim political dominance, as they were to overthrow the Muslim religious ascendancy, because it would have become equally irreligious, and so impossible, owing to such a ban. And like Afghanistan, Iran, Babylonia, ancient Egypt, Turkey and Morocco in the far west, India, in the east, would also have been completely Muslimized ! It would have become both politically and religiously an Islamistan ! That would have been the last line written about the Hindu History. But India was at least saved that horrible fate then, and once again was written a new chapter of the rejuvenation of Hinduism, illuminated by the dazzling valour of the Hindu warriors. 
625. The history of India as also of all the parts of the rest of the world, wherever the Muslims had established religio-political ascendancy amply proves that not only those several nations which were incapable of overthrowing the Muslim religio-political dominance became completely Muslimized, but even those other non-Muslim nations which smashed the Muslim political might but left their religious hold untouched could not escape the constant horrible pestilence of the Muslim onslaughts. Only five or six or at the most ten nations, which precipitated the Muslim religious downfall soon after their political and military defeat and rid themselves of every single Muslim, could—these and these alone could—free themselves completely from the Muslim pestilence ! For want of space only one instance of Spain should suffice to illustrate this point. 
•5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 249 
EMANCIPATION OF SPAIN FROM MUSLIMS 626. Simultaneously with their raids on India the Arabs under the Omayyads^", had overrun Spain and had established a powerful Muslim state there. Naturally as 
•elsewhere the Muslims began the religious persecution and conversion of the Spanish Christians^!. Countless Christian men and women were violently and mercilessly converted to Islam at the point of the sword or killed outright^*. Later 
•on after some centuries, when there were internecine wars amongst the Muslims themselves the much too oppressed Christians of Spain rose in revolt against the tyrannical -Muslims Government under one of their own old royal dynasties^' and with the help of a growing Christian nation in Prance and with encouragement from the Papal seat of Home^*. After many years of bitter warfare during the 11th and 13th centuries the Spanish Christians delivered most of their country from the Muslim rule and finally with the conquest of Granada in A.D. 1492 they wiped out the Muslim 
•power altogether'^. But as in India, so in Spain too, even 
•after the loss of political power, the Muslilns had their firm religious hold unimpaired on the converted Spanish Chris­ tians and the land they had actually inhabited. Nay this Muslim religious hold was getting more and more explosive and terrible so as to cut asunder the whole of the Spanish 
•Jiation at some future date^*. Those of the Spanish Christians who could clearly foresee this impending danger and who 'had always awaited an opportunity to wreak their revenge 
•decided to root out the Muslim religious influence from Spain, -as they did with their political overlordship. 
CHRISTIANS WERE NEVER FETTERED AS HINDUS WERE BY ANY RELIGIOUS BANS ON FOOD EXCHANGE, RECONVERSION AND SO ON 
627. The task of reconverting the countless Muslim- iized Christians was, therefore, so easy as to be readily .accomplished the moment these Spaniards simply willed it. 
250 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY' 
The only difficulty was that of the Muslim political andl military might. No sooner was the Muslim army destroyed than the Spanish Christians started the complete rout of the- Islamic faith in one holocaust throughout Spain. Thousands, of Muslimized Christians began to be rebaptized incessantly and speadily. 'The sporadic Muslim resistance infuriated the- Spanish nation all the more. The Spanish Government, the^ Spanish Christian Church and the Spaniards at large vowed openly that in their country no person calling himself or- herself a Muslim, nor any structure known as a mosque be allowed to remain unimpaired any longer. 
628. The newly independent Spanish government gave: an ultimatum^' that before an appointed date every sundry Muslim—man or woman—had either to court Christianity- willingly or to leave the country forthwith, with family and friends, bag and baggage. Whoever failed to do either,. after that date was to be beheaded mercilessly and unhesita­ tingly. 
629. What ? A Christian Government order ! How atrocious ! But it must be remembered that when the- Muslims conquered Spain they had imposed their faith far- more brutally on the Christian populace there and flooded the streets with Christian blood^'. Now the Christians were to rewash the streets with Muslim blood. As soon as the- stipulated time elapsed, the Spanish Christians rose vio- lentlyS' against the remaining Muslims at various places,, put everyone of them—man or woman, young or old—to the- sword ! The Christian church of Spain became pure with a Muslim blood-bath. Spain was rid of the Muslims entirely.. And so Spain remained Christian !. It was not turned into- another Morocco !! 
630. The same fate awaited the Muslims in Poland*". Serbia", Bulgaria**, Greece*' and other Christian nations.- They all rid their once Muslim-dominated countries of every single Muslim !! 
ir CHAPTER XII 
A RESUME 
631. The various points that have been discussed at length in the foregoing chapters viz., Ch. V to X I of this book- can now be briefly summarized here into a consistent whole. 
632. In the historic past, India, too, like all other great nations, had been invaded by the lonians, Sakas and Huns and other non-Hindu wild people. But after centuries of violent struggle with them all the Hindu nation stamped out their political dominance by smashing their armed might on the various battle-fields and became independent again and. again. Moreover it converted the millions of the Ionian,. Saka and Hun foreigners who settled down here in various provinces during the years of those hard struggles and taught them the Vedic cult, the worship of the Vedic gods and goddesses, and the Sanskrit civilization and culture so. as to merge them so completely amongst its own people as to leave not a single trace of their original non-Hindu races and names behind. 
633. W h e n the unprecedented calamity of the Muslim, aggression fell on India, the Hindus" kept on stubbornly fighting the aggressors for over a thousand years or so, and ultimately shattered the Muslim power as completely as they did the non-Hindu Saka-Hun empires; and once again they^ established their political independence ! Yet they could not recover their tremendous loss of numerical strength which was brought about by the forcible conversions nor could they regain the Indian areas actually occupied by the Muslim settlers here, nor even could they Hinduise the Muslims as completely as they did the Ionian, Saka, Hun and other non-Hindus 1 Why ? > 
634. The answer to this main vexing question is chiefly^ 
252 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
and thoroughly discussed with adequate historical proofs in €hapters V to X I of this book. The conclusion that one arrives at after evaluating the contemporary events and circumstances is that as soon as the Muslim rule was over­ thrown or was in the process of being overthrown, neither the Hindus at large, nor the Hindu rulers ousted the Muslim religious dominance even when proper opportunities present­ ed themselves and although they were far more strongly armed than their Muslim opponents. They did not convert 
•even a single Muslim to Hinduism by persuasion—let alone by force ! 
635. Had the victorious Hindu nation instantly broken off all bans on food-exchange, inter-marriages, (re) conversion seafaring and other refractory social and religious traditions and reconverted all the Muslims—whether converted or origi­ nal—and absorbed them in the then prevailing caste structure of the Hindu society, of course with due regard for the status and qualifications of the persons concerned (as they had already done with the Saka, Hun and other subju­ gated foreigners, in the by-gone days). Like Spain, India would immediately have been rendered Muslimless ! Hindus- than would have been at that very time, the place of the Eindus in the truest sense of the term. 
636-637. This treatise deals with the Muslim invasions of India during the period covering over a thousand years from A.D. 700 to A.D. 1800 and the chain of consequent Hindu-Muslim wars. Naturally the points raised in this discussion apply only to the conditions prevailing during that period. Therefore, while reading such historical disser­ tations and treatises, the reader must always bear in mind one important fact that the actions and the codes of conduct which are, or seem to be, most proper, beneficial and neces­ sary in th e context of the particular conditions obtainable during that period and in respect of persons and places concerned, may not necessarily be proper, beneficial under -different conditions or during another period. They might even be highly objectionable, detrimental and so unnecessary

at times under different conditions or with different persons. May those actions then refer to religion or politics or other walks of life ! Samartha Ramdas Swami well-versed in. religious and political sciences has succinctly made the same- point in the following words :-

CHAPTER XIII 
HINDU WAR POLICY ON THE RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL FRONT 
638-639. It is made amply clear in Chapters V to XII -of this book that in their religio-political war with the Muslims which the Hindus fought most tenaciously for centuries to­ gether the Hindu war-policy had not been sufficiently strong to defeat the Muslims on the religious front. Why, it proved to be definitely weak and suicidal in comparison with the -diabolically ferocious war-strategy of the Muslims on that front. Eor the Hindu nation had completely forgotten, at least in respect of the religious side of it, that a nation has, as a rule, to adopt a war-strategy far stricter, crueller and more unrelenting than that of the unscrupulous enemy it wants to conquer. 
640. During the Vedic and the Puranik (mythological) period, the ancestors of the Hindu Nation had to fight the Daityas, Danavs and the Rakshasas, the cruellest, most atrocious and cunning cannibals of the time. It is because '(as the Vedic and Puranik stories show) those of our ances­ tors, our gods, our emperors, the Vedic Rishis who chanted war canticles, the epic poets of the Puranas and all those who actively participated in the war could become more atrocious, more deceptive and cunning, and far crueller than those 
•enemies—like the Rakshasas and others—it is because they could formulate an adequate war policy to meet the ever changing guiles of the enemy and practise it effectively— that they could always succeed in those various wars, and our nation too became stronger and more expansive than before. 
64L It was not on the political front alone, but on the religious front too, that the enemy had to be faced in those 
-6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 255 
times ! When Vishwamitra took Shreeram to the forest to -protect the Rishis, the latter was told at great length how those Rakshasas destroyed the religious rites of the time, viz., the sacrifices, and how the daughters of the Rishis were kidnapped^. Later on in Dandakaranya Shreeram came to know what great havoc had the Rakshasa army of Ravan wrought upon the hermitages of the Rishis, who were in a -minority there, with their sacrificial rites, with their colonies and even with their lives*. Ram was also shown at various places the heaps of bones of those Rishis whose blood those 
•cannibals had drunk and whose flesh they had eaten.' This will clearly show that this long-drawn mythological war of 
•our ancestors with the Rakshasas was fought not only on the political but also on the religious front. And at that time those gods and god-like emperors, too, considered it the holiest religious duty to shows uper-savage cruelty to beat 
•down the cruelty of the Rakshasas, to be arch-devils against the devils ! (For a fuller discussion of the point please refer to paragraphs 460 to 461 of this book). It is enough to mention here that the incarnation of Nursinh who appeared in the most terrifying form in order to protect the great devotee -Prahlad and who tore to pieces his religious enemy, the 
wicked Hiranya Kashipu with his leonine talons was— 
A GOD-HEAD OF OUR NATION 
—was our leader ! The story of Kacha also shows that in 
the war our gods followed the policy— 
642. gsrfjcT ?r i ^mf^ ^rf^R: ii* 
'To fight the crafty enemy with super-craft, to destroy bar­ barism with hyper-barbarity, as the only effective means of annihilating the foe, was the praiseworthy principle of religious warfare of our ancestors till at lease the close of the Puranic era. 
643. However, when gods fought against other gods, 
•or when there were internecine wars like that of the Kouravas and the Pandavas, the war strategy differed completely. No single charioteer was to be attacked by many charioteers; 
256 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
the submissive or surrendering warrior was to be given his life^. Such considerations for justice and injustice were to be actually shown on the battle-field. This ethics of war was preached because it was honoured by both the contending parties. 
644. But, as we have already pointed out in paragraph 315, the invasions of varying magnitudes of the Persians, the lonians, the Greeks, the Sakas and the Kushanas and the Huns which began at the close of the Puranic period and continued during the early part of our historic past, were all made mainly for political ascendancy and not for any religious enmity. Their own religions were more or less like the offshoots of Hinduism itself. Later on, after their defeat by our Hindu ancestors, the millions of these foreign invaders who chose to settle here, merged into the Hindu society completely. So during this early historical period, in the absence of any religious aggression by these foreigners on our religion, our ancestors fought pure and simple political wars with them with effective strategical counter-moves and vanquished them completely. As these wars were purely political in nature, the question of religiosity or irreligiosjty, of extreme kindness, truth, violence or non-violence or other fine distinctions of principles never arose ! Naturally the tendency to retaliate in the same fashion even on the religious front—to face religious aggression with counter religious offensives—to meet cruelty with supra-cruel blows, craft with super-craft, violence with extreme violence and to consider this war policy to be a highly religious duty of a brave warrior—lay dormant in our national mind because there was no occasion for them to use such wars tactics on the religious front long after the religious wars with the Rakshasas. 
645. Moreover, during this intervening period, the different religious sects which were really the offshoots of the Vedic religion and which had a strong propensity to Sanyas (renunciation or asceticism) and extreme non-violence, like the Ajivakas, the Jains, the Buddhists and others, preached to the society that true religion meant extreme non-violence. 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 257 
kindness, love and truth and nothing else. Among the rest of the Vedic population class distinctions and their develop­ ment into caste differences and the religious traditions about food-exchange, touchables and untouchables; which cut to pieces the composite life of the society, were growing stronger and these very, really anti-social, traditions came to be con­ sidered as true religion. Later on flesh-eating was prohibited even in the sacrificial rites. The fact that the extreme forms and manifestations of truth most often prove to be the harmful vices was lost sight of by the religious ideology of the time, while the excessive, inopportune and suicidal use of virtues which ruined the nation, was itself considered the highest form of religious conduct. Generally speaking, truthful conduct is a virtue. To satisfy a promised gift or word is also a virtue ! But when in the heat of extolling virtues to the skies the Puranas (mythological stories) told the story of Harischandra who made good his promise given to Vishwamitra in his dream by presenting him with , his kingdom and such other childish stories, they definitely changed the national war-policy into an imbecile, weak and suicidal one. No words can adequately condemn this influence of the Puranas. More respectable than this truthful conduct was considered the practice of non-violence as the highest form of virtue not only by the Jains and the Buddhists but in some of the Vaishnav texts also, which later on hastened our terrible downfall as determinedly and as enormously as even our enemies, the Muslims, could not perhaps accomplish. Manliness and valour came to be condemned as the vilest of vices. The unmanly, the imbecile, the valour-lacking coward, not only lacking the ability but even the desire to avenge the national insult and injustice, came to be highly respected in religious circles as the greatest and most magnanimous saint, ripe for an honourable place in heaven. 
646. This point has already been adequately discussed with sufficient proofs and illustrations in Chapter VIII under the caption "Perverted Sense of Virtues" and in other chapters also; and it will be touched again while we shall be 
SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
narrating the events on the political front. Here it has to. be remembered that as all the invasions on India after the Puranik times had been political and not religious (at least not of such huge dimensions as those of the Rakshasas so as to shake the very foundation of our religion), we had completely forgotton the old war-strategy to meet such terri­ ble religious aggression. Our very definitions of virtues and religion and their practice had undergone a complete change. The war-strategy of Nursinh of the ancient times, which sought a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye had now become vegetarian, submissive, tolerant and shameless ! 
647. Naturally, when the Islam invaded Hinduism with far more ferocity and bitterness and with more dangerous weapons than the Rakshasas of the Puranik age, our Hindu ancestors of the seventh century had no other war-strategy to face it with, than the imbecile, impotent and suicidal one which offered milk to a venomous serpent. To encounter the wolf, the sheep had preferred its own neck ! A l l this, as also our consequent enormous losses on the religious front, has been clearly shown in the earlier chapters. Hence we shall now begin a critical study of the political side of this Hindu-Muslim epic struggle. 
• 
CHAPTER XIV 
THE AGE-LONG RELATIONS OF THE ARABS 
WITHt INDIA 
648. When I first read the word jg^cT (Musal) in my student days in 'Mousal Parva' in one of the secondary Puranas like the Hariwansh and wondered how the huge rushes uprooted by the Yadavas from the sea-shores became big pounding pestles which crushed their bones as some lethal weapons would, I at once hit upon one probable explanation that perhans the word, 'Mousal', might be an attempt at pun on the word Musal (g^rsr) by the Puranik punsters, and that it might have been suggested by the word Musalman given to the Arab traders of the past after their oonversion to Islam. But this fanciful explanation could not then be supported by the time-sense and other coordinating iistorical events. 
649. Much later in the Andamans when I began reading a, lot of Bengali Literature, I remember to have then perused an essay about the passing away of Lord Krishna either by 
•Shree Madhusudan Datta, the famous Bengali poet, of the narrative 'Meghanad' and the promoter of the 'Amitrakshar' metre, or by Bankimchandra, the poet who sang the national aong, Vande Mataram ! The said essay tried to offer a plausi­ ble explanation of the final exit of Balaram, after the death 
•of Lord Krishna, along with his followers into the sea in his original form of Shesh (^), a snake. It meant to say that Balaram entered the Western sea at Dwarka in his ships and went away to some foreign island in a serpentine fashion. I then remembered to have read a parallel instance mentioned by an Arya-Samajee traveller in the account of his travels. A b o u t fifty y e a r s a g o t h i s A r y a - S a m a j e e t r a v e l l e r h a d visited Arabia to see the actual condition of the Hindu 
260 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
residents of the place. After enquiry he found there is a small section of people who grew tufts of hair on the top of their {heads (as the Brahmins and other Hindus here did till very recently). They told him that, according to a very sacred legend handed down to them by their forefathers, they were supposed to have gone there from India at some very ancient time. It is believed that at the time of a great war in India they had left for Arabia and established a colony there, but never got themselves mixed up with the factions of the natives there nor with their feuds and wars. That was why they could be seen in their much the same original state. The inference that the said traveller has drawn from this is that these strange people must have been the same Hindus who had left India at the close of the epic struggle of the Kouravas and the Pandavas in Mahabharat^. 
650. If we then assume from the foregoing statements that Yadavas led by Balaram had gone to Arabia and formed a big colony there, two more things seem to. support such an assumption. The first is that Tamil was originally called (Aravi), the aborigines Arabia were mostly Shaiv- ites, worshipping the (Shiv) ling (as most of the historian agree) and their priests were called Druids (Dravid s[f^) in English—the same class which seems to have existed in Britain and Ireland as per the old legends told by the historians. 
651. This is not the place to relate all these and other legends bearing on this topic, but it can be fairly assumed that Arabia and India had very close ties and trade relations from very ancient times, and there must have been Indian colonies established in that peninsula, and we can infer that like those in Java, Sumatra and other lands in the Eastern Ocean, in this land in the Western Ocean too, now known as Arabia and others, there must have once thrived Indian (especially South Indian) colonies, kingdoms and civilization. But we cannot offer it here, as yet, as any proven fact or theory. Only the various details leading to this conclusion have simply been summarized here briefly so that they might 5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 26;1 
he of Some useto gQine future student of history who ipight be attracted to it. 
652. It is only pertinent here to write about the rela­ tions of India and Arabia during the seventh century when the Arabs had already courted Islam. Islam was born after the birth of Muhammad in A.D. 570, and it took at least forty to fifty years for the Arabs to join it. They had civil wars on the question of adopting this new faith. Yet the Muslim history is believed to start from their Hizri era in A.D. 622 and we might as well accept that belief for the present discussion. 
653. Even before these new Arabic Muslim aggressor^ crossed their borders and fell on their neighbouring Persian empire, the Hindu states had practically spread once again to the very distant borders of Chandragupta Maurya's empire beyond the Indus. The Chinese traveller, Huen-tsang entered India from the north-east about A.D. 629 and has left an eye-witness account of whatever he saw here. According to him the Hindu borders had stretched far beyond the Indus to include what are now called Kabul, Ghazni, and Gandhar*. Almost all the Chinese who came to India during those years had to crose these Hindu states and the Indus before they stepped into India. 
THE CHINESE OF THAT ERA CALLED THE HINDUS SHINTSU' 
654. That is why they in China referred to India by its most ancient name of Sindhu, and the Hindu people as 'Shintsu''. It is quite plain that this 'Shintsu' was a Chinese corruption of Sindhu. This j is yet another proof on the Chinese side that the word Hindu is derived originally from the word Sindhu. 
THE FIRST ARAB INVASION OF SINDH AND THEIR DEFEAT 
665. Most of the modern histories refer to the Arab invasion on King Dahir as the first invasion wherein the 
262 SIX GLOMOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Hindu King was completely defeated. But this is a blatant falsehood. The First Arab invasion of Sindh took place in A.D. 640 in which the invaders were completely vanquished and their commander-in-chief was killed by the Hindus (cf : paragraph 324) 
THE SECOND MAJOR INVASION OF SINDH BY THE ARABS 
656. But in A.D. 711, however, Mohammed Kasim marched on Sindh at the head of a fifty-thousand-strong army and while facing it bravely Maharaj Dahir of Sindh was destroyed, (cf. paragraphs 327 to 331). 
657. But immediately within fifty years of this fall of King Dahir, the Rajputs and specially their leader, Bappa Raval of Chitod, wrested it away from the Arabs and he and other Hindu kings pushed their boundaries right from the Pariyatra Mountain i.e. Hindukush mountains, Kashmir, Gandhar (which is now called Afghanistan) straight up to Sindhusagar (which we now shamelessly call Arabian sea). This Hindu sovereignty over the vast region lasted for three hundred years. 
THREE HUNDRED YEARS AMOUNT TO ABOUT SEVEN GENERATIONS 
658. Even when the Hindus held their sway over such a vast region for more than three hundred years and even when Sindh had been reconquered by the Rajputs within twenty-five years of its loss to Kasim, most of the English, as also the Hindu, historians never so much as mention it. On the contrary great historians, litterateurs, well-known professors all the world over as also the school-going children have all along been repeating blindly that right from the time Kasim conquered Sindh the Muslims began their onward march right up to Rameshwaram and for all these twelve hundred years or so from A.D. 711 to the time the British left India in 1947 the Hindus had been rotting in slavery. This assumption is as false as it is insulting to the Hindus. 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 26S 
This is an unbearable perversion of facts. 
659. Hereafter at least a truth-loving writer of history- should scrupulously avoid this falsehood, this perversion, of facts from school or college text-boobs as also from those of a greater worth and importance. 
THESE THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
660. For during these three hundred years i.e., up to A.D. 1000 or so in the whole of India right from Hindukush to Ceylon and to Burma in the east the Hindu Sovereign states ruled proudly. At such an early date as that the Hindu kings in the south like the Cher, Chowl, Pandya, Rashtrakut and others sometimes the one, at others the next ruled the vast southern seas so powerfully as to call themselves Trisamudreshwar. To say that the whole of India sweated in slavery under the Muslims or some other rulers, ignoring its prosperous and independent sovereign status, is to belie history. 
FROM A.D. 1000 TO A.D. 1030 
661. All of a sudden like a comet rose Mahmud of Ghazni, at this time. At his accession to the throne he vowed to Muslimize the whole of India and, as has been already described in paragraphs 365 to 375, carried on a series of depredations and arson, religious persecution and rapes and pollution and conversion throughout the vast tract from Multan in Punjab to Someshwar in Sourashtra. 
662. But it is because at such cataclysmal times the Hindus showed exemplary valour and perseverance and for­ bearance in facing all these calamites never losing self-respect or courage, that Hindu states could again raise their banners overthrowing the Muslim ascendancy hardly within twenty- five to thirty years of Mahmud Ghazni's death in A.D. 1030 with the sole exception perhaps of the northern part of the Punjab beyond the Indus. This can surely be cited as the astonishing illustration of the tenacity of any nation for that matter. 
264 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
663. Secondly, it must be remembered that during the thirty or forty years of the political havoc wrought by Mahmud of Ghazni in the north, the whole of South India had been displaying daring and adventure while enjoying independence, prosperity, and the mastery of the three seas as non-chalantly as before. 
664. This is why even during those thirty or forty years of Ghazni's raids, India as a whole can never be said to be slaving under the foreign heels. Of course we do not deny that a small part of the north-western Punjab was annexed by Ghazni establishing political as well as religious ascendancy firmly over there. However, it must also be borne in mind that even at that time Kashmir was a Hindu state. 
HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE DEATH OF MAHMUD OF GHAZNI 
I N A . D . 1030 
665. A hundred and fifty years i.e. about five genera­ tions after A.D. 1030 the whole of India right from Kashmir to Assam and Burma in the north and Rameshwaram in the South, was politically independent, powerful and prosperous as before. Great preachers, saints and Mahants and priests following the path of Shree Shankaracharya were, along with Smritikars Deval and Medhatithi, leading the cultural life of the whole of India and its oversea-colonies. Sanskrit was the Indian priestly language throughout. Kashi was the cultural centre of the whole Hindu nation. The great wounds suffered by our Hindu nation on the political front during the raids of Mahmud of Ghazni were healed up by rulers during these years. If the temple of Somnath was rebuilt on this side, new sky-high temples like that of Bhuvaneshwar and religious centres in Orissa and Assam rose to their full glory. The Hindu mastery of the Eastern, Western and the Southern seas, their trade and commerce, to-and-fro movement of thousands of their troops, their royal visits and return visits right up to Mexico in the tar east and to Africa in the west continued unhampered and 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 265 
therefore the Indians overseas could keep constant contact with their mother-land and thereby prospered materially as well as culturally. 
666. Can any Hindu-hater dare say, therefore, of this period at least that the whole of India was rotting in abject slavery ?

667. After the death of Mahmud of Ghazni, the Muslim power there grew far too weak because in the first place the population there consisted mainly of the aboriginal tribe- converted quite recently by craft or coercion to Islam and secondly because the Arabian Muslim States were being: destroyed completely by the Mongols and Turks, the two great Asian tribes which had not yet sworn allegiance to Islam^ during their sweeping raids through the vast tract of Central Asia right upto Europe. 
668. As has already been pointed out many big and small Hindu communities and royal families ruled this regioa for a long time. Ghuri was one of these Hindu communities round about Ghazni^ which was wholly converted to Islam during the Muslim religio-political aggressions. Being forced to follow the Muslim socio-religious practices for generations this originally Hindu community of the Ghuries- became so staunch and bigoted in their faith that they ardently desired to rule the other Muslims in Ghazni. From the same Muslim (yet originally Hindu) Ghuri community rose to power one Mohammad Ghori who subjugating all the- warring tribes during the internecine battles that broke out- after the death of Mahmud of Ghazni, finally proclaimed himself the Sultan of the State. In order to enlist the loyal support of all the Muslims he made everywhere the stock-in- trade proclamation, which reverberated throughout that region and the north-west region of Hindustan, that he would force all the Kafirs (meaning Hindus) in India to accept Islam and would found an empire there^. 
669. However, in spite of his ambition he could not do. 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 26T 
anything of the kind Mahmud of Ghazni had done before him in his seventeen horrible predatory raids because of the adverse circumstances. In A.D. 1176 Mohammed Ghori first captured the strong fort of Ooch near thecon fluence of the Panchnad with the Indus. Enraged at the weakness of her husband the qeen in the fort killed him and married her daughter to the victorious Mohammed surrendering the overlordship of the region at the same time*. 
670. Then in order to size up the Hindu Kingdoms Mohammed Ghori marched on the weakest one of Gujarat by proceeding stealthily along the borders of Rajasthan. For, the King of Gujarat having died, the Queen and her military chiefs enthroned a minor. This led Mohammed Ghori to think that it was weak enough to be attacked. But he was misled by appearances. For, on learning of Ghori's ensuing invasion, the Hindu army of Gujarat, augmented by those of other sympathising Hindu Kings, marched forward, to the mountain-ranges, of Abu. The Queen herself fought in the 
battle most valiantly, urging all the soldiers to defend the infant king whom, she said, she had delivered to their care. Inflamed by her words the whole Hindu army fought so- furiously that the Muslims were routed completely in all directions, Mohammed Ghori himself escaped narrowly and fled straight to his domain beyond the borders*. 
SECOND MAJOR DEFEAT OF MOHAMMED 
GHORI BY THE HINDUS 
671. Mohammed Ghori, however, was not to be daunted by adversities. So without being discouraged by his recent- defeat at Abu he once again marched on India in A.D. 1191, invading this time the territory of Prithviraj Chouhan, whereupon that gallant monarch of Delhi along with as many Hindu rulers as he could theng.ather advanced against Ghori and joining battle at Tarayan to the north of Karnool near Panipat dealt a crushing defeat on the invader, after a bloody dayS. Mohammed Ghori himself was captured alive by- Prithviraj. This battle is known as the Battle of Tatavadi. 
268 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN; HISTORY 
672. Emperor (Samrat) Prithyiraj and his feudatory princes were after all Hindus by birth and belonged tq the topmost Rajput ranks. Hence they sincerely believed that to let go the captive national enemy alive, however treache;- rous he might be, to give back his kingdom with all pomp and show, was the highest form of religious conducts conducive to heavenly bliss as regards a true warrior was concerned. 
673. f ^ R t ^vi;fir^T ^ =^Rr i 
5R-f^5r ififq' s^fft- 'g^rff^ ii* Were a serpent (an inveterate national enemy) to come with a view to bite the motherland, he should be smashed to pieces with a surprise attack, deceit or cunning or in any other way possible. Although this war-strategy of Shree Krishna and Chanakya was taught to the Hindus long ago, at that time it appeared to them like one of the five deadliest sins. For as we have already shown in paragraphs 397 to 454, the whole of the Hindu nation was at that time utterly infatuated with the perverted sense of virtues.... But the Muslims, however, followed this very war-strategy most 
scrupulously. 
674. See how : Had Prithviraj Chouhan, instead of Mohammed Ghori, invaded Ghazni and had the Muslims defeated the Rajputs (as the Rajputs had actually done with Mohammed Ghori) they would have not only killed Prithviraj but would also have converted, by using force and cunning, 
•all the captive Rajputs to Islam, would have made them, their wives and children slaves for the whole of their lives in their houses and the beautiful among the Hindu captive women Ghori himself might have taken into his harem and ravaged. To such a damned, demoniacal enemy of our religion, like Mohammed Ghori, was mercy shown by Prithvi­ raj and the other confederated Rajput rulers following sheepishly the textual maxim ^ 'JWR:. (a maxim to be used only in the case of some noble and magnanimous 
•enemy!) without the slightest consideration being given to the p ropriety of time, place and the circumstances and persons 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 269 
involved ! Nay, they showed mercy not only to Mohammed Ghori but even to the whole Muslim army, only to respect the noble Rajput tradition of assuring full protection from fear to those who surrendered meekly. Only an oral promise was obtained from Mohammed Ghori that he would not again invade India and he was allowed to go alive. His domain of Ghazni, too, was returned to him". And proud, more of their suicidal and credulous generosity than of their having defeated the Muslim army of Mohammed Ghori, those Rajput warriors marched triumphantly to Delhi and celebrated their victory ! BUT WHAT DID MOHAMMED GHORI 
DO ON REACHING GHAZNI ? 
675. D i d Mohammed Ghori forget his enmity to the Hindus because of this generosity of Prithviraj Chouhan ? No ! On the contrary like a snake, provoked by a slight injury Mohammed Ghori and all the Muslims in his kingdom, without any sense of gratitude for the Hindu imbecile generosity, were all the more embittered, and resolved to crush the Hindus altogether*. And with a huge army Mohammed Ghori once again attacked Prithviraj in A. D. H93», 
THE RAJPUT RASOS' AND THE BEST AMONG THEM THE PRITHVIRAJ RASO' OF CHAND BHAT 
676. In fact it is impossible and improper to write any trust-worthy history of the Rajputs without closely studying the contemporary historical accounts written by the Rajput Bhats and Charans in their heroic and, to some extent, poetic style and known in that region as 'Rasos'. But it is doubtful whether amongst our historians there be five or at the most ten such as have read them with any scientific curiosity ! That is why none of the histories written of the Rajputs of the times or, for that matter, of the whole Hindu society of that age, with the solitary exception of that of Col. Tod really deserves to be truly called histories. They are mere 
270 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORK 
translations or transliterations of stray incoherent remarks and disconnected and perverted accounts of the Muslim or the English writers. Independent' Rasos' seem to have been composed on valiant Rajput Ranas, proud of their religion (Hamir Raso, Chhatrasal Raso, etc.). The 'Rasos' are not pure, unadulterated histories ! But the forceful and vivid descriptions of the various events, their high fervour and the fact of their authors' participation, to a lesser or greater 
•degree, in those particular historical events make those grand incidents live, as it were, before the imagination of the reader, as the above-mentioned sketchy outlines of chrono­ logical accounts can never do. 'Prithviraj Raso' by the famous Chand Bhat, who M'as in the pay of Prithviraj, bears 
•out the above remark by its epic serenity, calm dignity and moving pathos in its descriptions of the Hindus of the time and of its account of the first Muslim raids from the north- 
•west^o. THE STORY OF THE FIRE RACE ( ^T^^^ ) 
677. This 'Prithviraj Raso' gives the famous anecdote of the sif'H-^ the fire-race in connection with the origin of the Rajput dynasties. According to it when the plague of the non-Hindu invaders grew enormously, Saint Vasishta perfor­ med a grand sacrifice on Mount Abu from the leaping flames 
•of which appeared four splendid warriors in order to protect the Vedic Hindu religion. These were the founders of the four celebrated Rajput dynasties : the Quhilots of Chittod, the Pratihars of Kanouj, the Chouhans of Sambar and the Parmars of Dhar. The essence of this popular anecdote seems to us quite consistent with history. For after the Hindus vanquished the Huns utterly and when the latter began to merge wholesale in the Hindu society, the saints of those 
•days must necessarily have performed some gigantic sacrifice of purification and conversion for atleast some hundreds of them—a memorable incident which perhaps finds this poetic 
•expression in Chand Bhat's 'Prithviraj Raso' in the finest tradition of the Puranik writers. •5m GliORIOUS E P O C H : 271 
678i ' The Nagari Pracharini Sabha had undertaken to republish this 'Prithviraj Raso' in 1922-23 when I was in prison at Ratangiri, where some parts of it were sent to me on request by my brother for my essay on Hindutwa. I do not Jmow, however, whether this whole book was ever published. 
THESE NON-HINDUS ARE SHAMELESS WE, HINDUS FIGHT SHY ! 
679. The 'Prithviraj Raso' describes the Hindu-Muslim skirmishes and frays in the epic style of Mahabharat, and the poet has praised the Hindus highly for vanquishing Moham­ med Ghori again and again and then setting him free to go 
•alive, because this noble act of the Hindus, he thought, added to their glory ! But when Mohammed Ghori again attacked Prithviraj in A. D. 1193, violating his promise that he would never again invade India, Ghand Bhat wrote wrathfully, "We Eindus are scrupulous about religious and irreligious conduct, about truth and falsehood, we fight shy of sinful acts, but these non-Hindus (meaning Muslims) are utterly shameless ! 
680. But the breach of promise which could Muslimize the whole of the Kafir state was a highly religious duty for the Muslims, and because Mohammed Ghori broke his promises again and again he became a Gazi among the Muslims ! This fact also must be engraved on the hearts of the Hindus that the Muslims who acted irreligiously according to Chand Bhat were blessed with success by God whereas'the Hindus who never broke any promise but showed the quixotic greatness of setting the enemy free alive were crushed outright owing to their steadfast adherence to their so-called religious conduct 1 
681. There was another reason why Mohammed Ghori thought it to be the best opportunity to march against Pirthviraj. Jaychand, the King of Kanouj, had secretly given a solemn promise to help him against Prithviraj, his direst enemy!!, a promise which later proved fatal to himself. In 1193, the Hindu-Muslim armies met at Sthaneshwar, where 
272 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY"- 
in the thick of the fray fell in the hands of the Muslims, dead ox alive the Rajput princes, Chainundrai, Hamir, Hada and good many other warriors ! Muslim losses in lives were also terrible. .All this detailed account should really be read,, if possible, from the 'Prithviraj Raso'itself, because in the historical accounts by the Muslim writers nothing but censure^ and condemnation of the Kafirs can only be met with, and with the exception of these poetical Rasos, histories, written by Hindu writers, do not simply exist. The Muslim writers vouch that Prithviraj was, at length, killed in the. battle and the Muslims were victoriously. Soon after this victory Mohammed Ghori marched straight to Delhi, because he had to perform his diabolically pious deed of demolishing the Hindu temples, of slaughtering the masses of Hindus, of arson and especially of ravaging the young wife of Prithviraj, the daughter of Jaychand, Sanyogita, who was well-known at that time for her exceptional beauty. Fast as Mohammed Ghori made for Delhi, faster still went the tragic news of" the defeat of Prithviraj and of his death or probable capture by the Muslims, to the royal palace of Delhi, whereupon, according to the pre-arranged plan perhaps, the empress Sanyogita lost not a minute to face the danger boldly in the traditional Rajput way. At once, leaving aside all consider­ ation for wealth, parental love, fraternal affection, the attachment to her earthly existence, and breaking all ties of love and duty she jumped from the top-most floor of the palace and killed herself with the word Jayhar (stflsr)—glory to God Shiv ! on her lips she performed Jayhar—Johar I What of the empress, Sanyogita, hundreds of other Hindu 
•H^omen leapt one after another into the Yamuna (Jamuna) and drowned themselves before the Muslims could even touch or pollute them ! 
682. On reaching Delhi, Mohammed Ghori immediately set to plunder and destroy the royal palaces and the citizens with fire and sword, to his heart's content^'. Proclaiming next the establishment of the Muslim power there, he appointed a trusted slave, of his, ope Kutubuddin, as his 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 273 
chief administrator, and went straight off to ^Ghazni. Later on within two years in 1195 Mohammed Ghori attacked Jaychand. With his administrator Kutubuddin to assist- him he marched on Kanouj where in a furious scuffle Jaychand was utterly vanquislied and killed^*. In a sense the Indian King received a fitting reward for his high treason against- the Hindu nation ! 
683. Nearly a hundred years or more had elapsed since the dreadful raids of Mahmud of Ghazni and as such their recollection was growing fainter like an evil hallucina­ tion or dream in the Hindu mind. So with these two invasions of Mohammed Ghori, every Hindu King, Emperor, Saint, dignitary of every sort, down to the hut-dweller was shocked to the marrow of his bones at this miserable plight of Hindu courage and strength. Mohammed Ghori, too, was elated at this unexpected victory, and hearing of Kashi (Benares) as the holiest of Hindu places of worship he headed straight for it in order to destroy Hindu religion. 
684. The people at Kashi were taken unawares by this fanatical and blood-thirsty raid and as such had no arrange­ ment to face it. Naturally Mohammed Ghori captured Kashi in no time, started forthwith to slaughter Hindu men and women, to plunder the Hindu house's, to ravish Hindu women, and specially to force countless Hindu men and women to accept Islam and slavery. Above all he raised to big heaps of rubble and brick every Hindu temple and broke the idols within it to bits^^. 
685. But he immediately heard the news that in the Hindu states beyond and especially in Rajasthan, plans were being chalked out of encircling him ; and having the bitter experience of the united Hindu swordsmen twice before, he satisfied himself with whatever he could achieve during one sweep from Kanouj to Kashi (Benaras), and went back to Ghazni. As before he appointed his versatile, brave and trusted slave K u t u b u d d i n , himself as the Governor of the recently won territory upto Kanouj^*. 
686. And alas ! At this very evil, unpropitious moment 
274 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
•our age-old Capital of the Hindu empire since the days of Yudhishthir this our Indraprastha, Hastinapur or modern Delhi, was lost to the non-Hindus and there was laid the foundation stone of the Muslim empire *;for centuries to 
•come ! Delhi became the centre of servitude and remained so rotting under the foreign rule for the next five or six hundred years (with very short breaks in between ) till at last the Marathas triumphantly hoisted their saffron-coloured flag at Attock and overthrowing the Muslim imperial power beyond, made it the handmaid of the Hindu imperial 
•authority. 
687. Soon after he reached Ghazni, Mohammed Ghori was killed, (in the opinion of some Muslim historians,) by a 
•small band of soldiers in his army^^, but Chand Bhat gives a colourful and detailed description in his Baso of how Prithviraj seized the one unique opportunity to kill him -and avenged his defeat. Although no other support for this folk-lore can be found, as yet, it is not unworthy of a mention here. The essence of this superbly described folk­ lore in the poetical 'Prithviraj Raso' is that Prithviraj was captured alive by Ghori and was not killed in the battle. Mohammed Ghori took him to Ghazni as a captive and struck out his eyes, making him blind. At this shocking news Chand Bhat went on his own to Ghori's court at Ghazni in order to do his traditional duty as a Bhat of laying down his life for his emperor. Charans and Bhats were supposed to bear a charmed life,—they were not to be killed—and the Muslim rulers also could not generally break this conven­ tion ! Sultan Mohammed Ghori too asked Chand Bhat to have his say. Chand Bhat was a well-knwon and ready- witted, facile poet, who sang out at the top of his sonorous voice a heroic ballad to mean, "My master is your captive and you are sure to end his life as best you please. But my sole request is that I should also be killed with him in the same or any other manner. Secondly, I submit that the Sultan should himself witness a demonstration of the exceptional skill of my master in the wonderful art of hitting 
6 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 275 
the sound—n\*<i^'^-—in archery. This request made the Sultan 
•curious about this wonderful art. Even then with every precaution the necessary arrangements for the demonstration Tvere made. Twenty-one pans were hung in a row. Sultan IMohammed sat eagerly with his select retinue and his noble­ men at a high place in the court to witness the feat. Chand Bhat and Prithviraj, the last Hindu Emperor of Delhi, were made to sit before the pans in the wake of a strong military guard. Then as each pan was struck the stroke rang clear and loud. As soon as the sound rang out the blinded Emperor Prithviraj took an unmistakable aim at the pan concerned and hit the mark. As this feat was repeated with exceptional accuracy of aim for twenty-one times, the whole court was thrilled with wonder and admiration and the 
•clapping of hands went on unceasingly, and finally the Sultan himself shouted aloud 'shabas, shabas'—'bravo, bryo!!' At that very moment the captive Chand Bhat sitting near Prithviraj composed a couplet (^fi) on the spur of the moment telling Prithviraj to shoot, without wasting a moment, the Sultan sitting at a particular distance, shouting 'shabas, shabas—Bravo, bravo'. At this the blinded Emperor Prithviraj took an aim in the direction of the Sultan shouting -"shabas, shabas' and killed him with a sharp arrow. At once there was an uproar and confusion everywhere, but before the gaurds of the Sultan could fall upon them with their weapons, Prithviraj and Chand Bhat drew out their own swords and cut off their own heads ! 
THE SLAVE DANASTY 
688. Soon after the death of Mohammed Ghori, his slave (governor) administrator in India, Kutubuddin, himself became the Sultan and established his independent kingdom at Delhi. Kutubuddin was a Turk by birth, but as he was -a slave of Mohammed Ghori, his dynasty is called the Siave Dynasty. 
276 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INEdAN HISTORY 
THE FICTITIOUS STORY OF KUTUBMINAR 689. The legend that he built the famous Kutubmina? as a memorial to his victory is altogether false. This pillar of victory was built as Vishnu stambh—the pillar of Vishnu— by a certain Hindu emperor, mo?t probably by Samudra Gupta and was dedicated to Lord Vishnu^*. Recent excava­ tions have discovered an ancient idol of Shree Vishnu near the pillar, which supports the above assertion. Thereafter Prithviraj Chouhan improved it to a great extent; so in the Rajput period it was sometimes called Prithvistambh^'. The Muslims had grown very much fond of obliterating the names and all other traces of the old monuments and stam­ ping them with their own seals wherever they went on with their expeditions. Hence in India, too, they changed the old original names of the capitals they conquered, the holy placep^ of pilgrimage, the important sites, works of art and gave them all their Muslim names. According to this mischievous habit Kutubuddin named this very monument of Vishnu- stambh Kutubminar. At many places on that pillar he got the hymns and aphorisms from the Koran engraved in Arabic, and added some new features to the pillar here and there. But the blocks of stones that were required for this purpose were intentionally procured from the demolished Hindu temples and the idols therein. 
RAIDS ON CHITOD AND HINDU VICTORIES 
690. While Kutubuddin was conquering the Punjab,. Delhi, Kanouj and other Hindu states, he was uneasy about the Rajput states. Soon he learat of the death of Rana Samarsing of Chitod and of the succession of his minor son Karna to the throne. He was not a fool to let go this fine opportunity to subdue it. But the mother of the minor king of Chitod, Karundevi, was very brave and of great abilities. That young mother-queen took the leadership of the army and inspiring the other neighbouring Hindu states to fight on her side, dealt a memorable defeat on the Muslim army in a battle near Ambar (Amber of Amer)^''. In order to avoid 
5TH G L O R I O U S E P O C H 277 
complete destruction, Kutubuddin retreated to Delhi; Later on when Rahup succeded Kama to the throne of Chitod, Kutubuddin's army once again marched on Chitod. But once again the Rajputs put the Muslim army to rout'^. Rana Rahup proved to be a very able ruler. The Muslims therefore never thought of invading Chitod till his death. 
691. But it must be remembered here that even while the Muslims launched repeated attacks on the Hindu states, the Hindus as a rule never invaded them nor ever pursued the fleeing Muslim army, nor again besieged the Muslim localities left behind and destroyed them or their Masjids* It is because the Hindus never thus retaliated the Muslim aggression owing to their perverse sense of virtues, the latter again and again perpetrated these crimes against the former. 
692. After Kutubuddin's death in A.D. 1210, one or two incapable Sultans came to the throne of Delhi, but as they were soon deposed Sultana Razia began to rule'^. She was well trained in the affairs of the State by Kutubuddin himself. She attended the court or her army in the guise of a man. Later on she fell in love with a trusty slave of hers, named Jalaluddin, who chiefly manoeuvred things in the court and began to live openly with her. This was, however, most detestable to the Turkish noblemen of her court, because Jalaluddin was a Negro. The Turks thought themselves to be of high rank and despised the Negros as low­ bred. 69 3. This will make another point clear, to the reader that although the Turks, the Mongols, the Arabs, the Pathans, the Negros (Abyssinians) and others called them­ selves Muslims and proudly proclaimed the absence of caste- differences and exhibited in place and out of place the equality of status for all in order to belittle the Hindus on that account, they were not altogether free from those caste- differences. These distinctions were on the contrary far too pronounced amongst them and caused a good deal of trouble. 694. Shortness of space compels us to refer the reader to a chapter in our book, "Essay on Abolition of Castes'* 
278 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
( o f l f g ^ ^ ? fe''?) n a m e d " S e c t s a n d P a c t i o n s A m o n g s t t h e Muslims"23. 
695. In the end the Turkish noblemen rose in rebellion against the Negro (Abyssinian?) Jalaluddin and Sultana Razia under the leadership of Altunia, the governor of Sarhiud, and defeated Razia in a battle, whereupon Razia cast her spell upon the victor Altunia and married him. The newly wedded couple marched on Delhi once again but were defeated and killed by the noblemen and the army there. After jconsiderable court intrigues and plots and counter­ plots a nobleman, named 'Bulban' usurped the throne and became the Sultan of Delhi. 
MONGOL RAIDS—CHENGEEZKHAN 
696. During the reign of this very slave dynasty Mongol raids on India's farthest borders through Central Asia were causing constant trouble. Like whirlwinds great armies from Mongolia who had not so far sworn their allegiance to Islam went on trampling over, and crushing, all the nations and countries from the Pacific to the Black Sea**. Their leader in those days was the world-famoua Chengeezkhan, who, till the last moment of his life, heajaed all possible ignominies and insults on the Muslim and Arab States and the Muslim religion. He deposed and killed the Khaliph of Baghdad, whom the Muslims highly respected as the political and religious representative of God, and raised to the ground the city of Baghdad*". Yet the Allah could do absolutely nothing against him. With his ploughshare of destruction he furrowed the vast territory right up to Russia without the least obstruction; he overthrew the kingdom of Kiev in Russia*^, ravaged the whole tract straight up to the Black Sea with massacre, plunder, arson and annexed it to- his transcontinental empire. But no power on this vast earth dared restrain this destructive hand of Chengeezkhan ! On their way back from Russia these Mongol armies were obvi­ ously to dash violently against India. But quite mysterious­ ly, he went straight off to Mongolia, after first subduing the 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 27^ 
Muslim kingdom of Ghazni and quite suddenly died there in A.D. 1227. Later on this extensive empire passed into the hands of one of this Mongol race—Kublai Khan. These Mongols had already reduced the whole of China and Korea.^ Kublai Khan made the age-long Chinese capital of Peking his own'". 
697. One after-effect of this Mongol-Turkish struggle- was that they had a mixed progeny, which was called Moghal or Mughal. These Moghals frequently tried to rush into India and finally reached Delhi. Some of them took to Islam, but the old Muslims did not treat them equally ; they consi­ dered them to be low-born. These Moghals founded in Delhi a separate colony of theirs named 'Moghalpura'". Some others of them went to the Rajputs for shelter because the old Muslims scoffed at them. Especially some two thousand of them sought employment in the army of the valiant Hindu king of Ratanbhor. 
698. Sultan Bulban of the Slave Dynasty was in a sense the most powerful and able ; he called himself the true repre­ sentative of Allah. But as regards his hatred towards the Hindus he surpassed everybody from the emperor to the meanest of servants^®. He imposed various heavy taxes on the Hindus, forbade their pilgrimages to the holy places while their forcible conversions and massacres went on unceasingly from village to village. 
699. Bulban died in old age in A.D. 1286"'. There being no able person from the Slave Dynasty to succeed him, within four years a nobleman from the Khiiji family Jalal- luddin, slew the sons and grandsons of Bulban and proclaimed himself the Sultan of Delhi, putting a stop to the Slave Dynasty for ever, and starting his own, 
KHILJI DYNTSTY 
700. This Khiiji dynasty of Jalalluddin called itself Pathans (Afghans), if at all it was of Turkish extractions Jalalluddin himself was, as the other Sultans and Muslims were, fired with the devilish ambition to destroy the Hindu 
280 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
political, as well as religious, power root and branch. He was just, as regards other departments of administration, but was partial to the Muslims. Seeing the tremendous loss of Muslim lives in the siege of Batanbhor, he raised the siege and decamped saying, "I value a single hair of a Muslim more than a hundred such forts." But this wisdom of his was so belated that the cause for this action of his has to be sought in the unbeaten valour of the Rajputs. After this failure he never again troubled the Rajputs. 
701. The old Jalalluddin really wanted to enthrone his one ambitious, brave, and staunch Muslim nephew, Allauddin after his own death. So he had sent him with a large army to face the Rajputs But not content with this assignment which seemed too meagre for his daring Hindu-hatred he marched straight off without the Sultan's permission to conquer the southern Hindu states and rob them of their reported fabulous wealth of which he had lately grown covetous beyond every limit. The first Hindu state to fall a victim to this unexpected attack of Allauddin was that of the Yadavas of Devgiri. 
702. There is one special point to be noted as regards this southern conquest of Allauddin. The Hindu society of the south had, for more or less two thousand years, from the early beginnings of the modern history i.e. from 500 or 600 B.C. to the 13th century A.D., been enjoying complete political, religious and social independence and had been economically highly prosperous. It had never been success­ fully invaded throughout these two thousand years^^. Whoever of the foreign invaders dared to do so, was ruthlessly crushed on the borders themselves. So this invasion of Allauddin was the first of its kind and was bound to be successful, with far-reaching harmful effects. Because of this special revolutionary and harmful character of this invasion of Allauddin it has to be dealt with in a fresh chapter. CHAPTER XVI 
MUSLIM INVASIONS ON SOUTH INDIA 
SOUTH INDIA UPTO THE BEGINNINGS OF THE 14TH CENTURY. 
703. Right from the beginnings of known history i.e. from about 500 or 600 B.C. to the beginning of the 14th century South India never knew any great foreign invasion 
•either by land or sea. The Hindu states there enjoyed their political liberty and power almost unhampered and unimpe- 
•ded. On the contrary millions of Hindu people and armies of the Kalings, Pandyas, Chers, Chols, Andhras, Rashtrakuts, 'Chalukyas, Yadavas and others upto Dwarka had victoriously spread their political and commercial supremacy, their theo­ logical and scientific knowledge, their art and sculpture upto Mexico on the one side and to central Africa on the other^. 
704-705. But this glorious achievement of the Hindu states of the South of maintaining their independence for over two thousand years has never been so specifically and forcibly stated anywhere in history' ! We however challenge if any 'country or state of such magnitude as that of the continent like South Indian peninsula can be found on the face of this earth which has valiantly maintained its independence, 
•power and empire and kept foreign invaders either by land 
•or sea off its territories for such a long period ! 
706. And such a country like India, more than half of -whose territory enjoyed such a glorious past, is derided by -some half-crazy jealous historians, foreign as well as Indian, or by some Hindu-haters like Dr. Ambedkar or by some quite ignorant writers, so as to say, 'Indian history from the 'beginning is a history of a slavish people, sunk deep into foreign bondage and constantly trampled under foreign heels.' 'The word 'slavery' sums up the whole history of the Hindus 
282 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
who have been dragging on the poor existence for tens and socres of centuries^ ! 
707. At least from now onwards every Indian or non- Indian historian must, for the love of truth, mention specifically this glorious peculiarity of South India ! Then alone their writings would deservedly be called history ! ! 
THE CREDIT DUE TO THE HINDUS OF THE NORTH 
708. Of course, while speaking of this glorious achieve­ ment of the South of India—of maintaining its independence and vast empire over such a long period—due credit must be- given to the Hindu warriors who tenaciously fought for more than six or seven hundred years the bloody and disas­ trous wars with the Arabs, Pathans, Turks, Moghals, millions of pillaging aggressors of numerous nations and communities, of almost the whole of Asia, and halted their all-sweeping advance there in the North for such a long period ; and to those millions of Hindu martyrs who gave away their lives for defending their religion by leaping into the hungry flames,, into the bounding waves of the flooded rivers or in the wholesale man-slaughter carried on by the enemy, but never forsook their religion as per their various beliefs ! The Hindu history can never forget—must never forget—these immeasur­ able obligations of those generations of Hindus of the North over the whole of the Hindu nation—obligations which can have no requital whatsoever ! 
709. However world history itself tells us that even the greatest of nations, too, fall victims, some time or the other, even if after a very long lapse of time, to some foreign, domination. Similarly towards the very end of the 13th century (in A.D. 1294) this sub-continent of South India was overcome with this calamity of the foreign Muslim^ aggression. 
710. But it must be remembered here that the only: nation in the then known world, which could be fairly- compared with India as regards its extent and greatness—the 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 283 
Chinese nation—was overrun from end to end and subjugated by Chengeezkhan nearly a hundred years prior to the 14th century*; and simultaneously with the first invasion of South India by Allauddin—of which we are going to write very shortly—it had already become the foot-stool of the foreign throne of the Mongol Emperor, Kublai Khan^ ! But can any profane, abusive writer make bold to say that the Chinese nation has all along been rotting in foreign bondage ? 
MODERN HISTORY OF SOUTH INDIA 
711. The relevant and sufficient portion of the ancient history of South India has already been referred to in an early part of this book. We can safely assume that with the downfall of the Shalivahan dynasty in A.D. 236 or thereabout began the modern history of South India. Thereafter the gallant Chalukya Emperor, Pulakeshi shone like a light­ house tower, counting the passage of time, in the history of the South. He too has been mentioned in the earlier chapters. To his court had come the famous Chinese traveller, Huen-tsang (or Yuan Chwan) who has first used the word Maharashtra to describe Pulakeshi's kingdom*. That is the first important recorded use of the word in history. Emperor Pulakeshi fell fighting with the Pallav king, Nursinh Varma, of the South in A.D. 642 and his kingdom was conquered by the Pallavas. But very shortly afterwards it was reconquered, by his son, Vikramaditya I, after defeating the Pallavas in a furious battle. 
712. To this very Chalukya dynasty belonged Vikrama­ ditya 11, who later on in the 8th century A.D. sent a huge army to Navasari and defeated the Arab invaders there ! 
713. Various such Hindu conquests over the Muslims are not even mentioned in modern histories. History of late has become too partial and vulgar. The various such incidents of Hindu supremacy and superior craft, that have been mentioned hereotfore, can very rarely be found in the contemporary histories written by Muslim writers. Hereafter at least Hindu writers should describe such glorious acts of 
284 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
valour of the Hindu kings and warriors after careful research. 
714. The above-mentioned royal dynasty of the Pallavas was one of the valorous and prosperous ones of the South. They had their capital at Kanchi (Kanjivaram) for some time^ At the end of the ninth century A.D. a Choi king of South India itself, named Aditya, overpowered Aparajit Pallav' and subdued his kingdom for ever. 
THE RASHTRAKUTS 
715. After the Chalukyas the Rashtrakuts had esta­ blished a prominent and very powerful kingdom bringing practically the whole of the South and even the southern part of Gujrath under their sway. For some time they had their capital at Malkhed. B y far the most important achievement of theirs is getting the famous Kailas cave carved at Verul (Ellora). 
716. After the lOth century A.D. there were only two prominent kingdoms in the South ; those of the Cholas of Tanjawar (Tanjore) and the Pandyas of Madura. Fortunately we have the eye-witness account of the political indepen­ dence of the South, their prosperous state, and their gallantry, by a third party, namely Marco Polo, the celebrated, discerning, learned European (Italian) traveller and writer who had spent many years of his life in the court of Kublai Khan in China and M'ho on his way back had at this very time stayed for some days at Madura, the Pandya capital^. His testimony as to the Hindu mastery of the three seas and their oversea empires, which we can find in his book of travels, is the most important. For, when he came from China to India he came via Indo-China and visited the Hindu states in Sumatra and other islands. At the time of his sojourn in Sumatra, the island was ruled by one Hindu king, Shree Vijay', who gave equal protection to the Buddhists also. Marco Polo thereafter went back to Venice, his place 
•of birth, about the year A.D. 1295. Two or three other foreign travellers had come and stayed in India at that time, 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 285 
and have left behind them some account of their travels^ which, along with that of Marco Polo, bear important and independent witness to the fact of the complete political freedom of the Southern Hindu states, of their political, commercial and religious supremacy over many other nations around them, of their overlordship of the Eastern, Western and Southern Seas, of their powerful navies and merchant-marine which traversed the tides of the three seas unopposed, and of the unrivalled title of 'Trisamudreshwar' which these .southern Hindu kings proudly took for themselves. 
717. 'Trisamudreshwar' emperor Rajendra Chowl died in A.D. 1042 and after one or two powerful kings after him the Chowl dynasty and the Chowl empire perished at the end of the 13th century. 
RELIGIOUS PREACHERS LIKE SHANKARACHARYA 
AND OTHERS 
718. During these years South India saw not only the rise ofroyal heroes like Rajendra Chowl, but also the glorious heights reached by religious heroes, the foremost among them being Shreemat Shankarcharya, defeating the various so called heretical views which were being advocated throughout India against the Vedic religion. At Kaladi in Karal was born this great personality of Shankaracharya in a Nambudri Brahmin family. Being well versed in the Vedic lore and having taken the vow of Sanyas (having renounced the worldly life) even before the tender age of sixteen, he began to preach and conquer the heretics in all quarters^". Kumaril- bhatta, the well-known exponent of the Karma theory, who successfully refuted the Buddhist religious opinions was also preaching throughout the four corners of India round about this time. Another preacher Diggaja (f^nsi)—(the elephant defending the directions)—Mandanmishraii was also the contemporary of this young Shankaracharya. In order to establish his theory of Sig;*s (the non-existence of duality between—the unison (unity) of—Jeevatma and Paramatma) and to hoist the victorious banner of Vedic religion through- 
286 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTOfeV 
out the whole of India Shankaracharya went on searching out and complietely defeating in religious debates not only the followers of the absolute theory of karma but also the other non-Vedic beliefs and even the renowned leaders of the Buddhist religion. Finally he paraded the victorious Vedifc banner throughout India and established, authoritative religious institutions of bis order at four places in the four directions of India : at Shringeri in the south, at Dwarka to the west, Jagannathpuri in the eastern quarter and at Kashmir to the farthest north. These religious seats (institu­ tions) received full Government support so long as Hindu states existed in those various places^^. Having accomplished this wonderful work of religious propaganda and having written the (unparalleled) unrivalled book, 'Shankarbhashya', he entered the cave—took a living samadhi—(ended his life by restraining his breath). 
THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE SHAIVITE S E C T S L I K E T H E P A S H U P A T A S ' 
719. Even before this period was resuscitated the Shaivite Sect of the Pashupatas", which being militant like the Shaktas, extremely hated the meek 'sjff^—non-violence' —and renunciation of the worldly life of the Buddhists and Jains. It fomented and fanned to red heat, at least indirectly, among the Hindus the tendency to oppose the non-Hindu religious aggressors and a love for war. Shree Lakulesh" was their apostle, who was born in Gujrath and whose great work and influence made the Hindus take him for the very incarnation of Lord Har (Shiv) and whom even Shankaracharya mentions proudly. 
BENGAL DURING THESE YEARS 
720. Till 700 to 800 A.D. Bengal was ruled by the Pal kings, the first of whom was king Gopal^^. He was a Buddhist. He had from his queen, Deddadevi", a son, named Dharmapal who ruled from 800 to 825 A-D^'. He too was a Buddhist and had been married to Ranadevi the daughter, of the Rashtrakut king Govind, who was most 
- 5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 281 
famous in the South. By about A.D. 1095 the Sen dynasty destroyed the Pal kings and founded their own kingdom^*. These Sen kings were the Kshatriyas from Karnatak in the south, who had their silent access to the royal circle perhaps through the retinue of the above-mentioned Rashtrakut princess, Ranadevi^*. Whatever that is, as these Sen Kings -were the staunch followers of the Vedic religion, they suppressed Buddhism in Bengal and vigorously revived the caste-system, rendered chaotic by intermingling of different wastes during the Buddhist period, as also the Vedic lore and other Vedic religious institutions'". The book on Sanskrit gr;i mmar, Mugdhaboth, written by Bopdev was very popular in Bengal at this time. 
THE CONTEJVIPORARY HISTORY OF GUJRATH 
721. The famous king Karnaraj who built the extensive lake of Krishnasagar ruled Gujrath from A.D. 1063 to 1093. The original capital of his royal family was at Pattan, which he shifted later on to a new place and named it Karnavati, and it remained the capital of Gujrath ever afterwards'^.' 
722. But later on when Gujrath was overcome by the -Muslims, Sultan Ahmedshah, who persecuted the Hindus most cruelly, changed the historical Hindu name of Karnavati to Ahmedabad in A.D. 1412, befitting the traditional Muslim malignity towards the Hindus", and added to it a newly built suburb. And the meek and submissive attitude of the Hindus of those times has been fondling that name ever since as their own. 
THE FIRST INVASION OF THE SOUTH BY THE FOREIGNERS AND NON-HINDUS 
723. Sultan Jalalluddin's nephew, Allauddin, crossed the Vindhyas with a huge army without any permission from his uncle and attacked the south of India, to loot the fabulous wealth of which he had so long been receiving tempting reports. This invasion was so unexpected and the negligence, conceit and narrow-mindedness of the South 
?88 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Indian Hindu Kings of that time were so profound and criminal that perhaps it is after his kingdom was actually attacked that the king of Devgiri, Maharaja Ramdevrao Yadav, came to know of it, and being thoroughly unprepared to face it was utterly confused**. 
723-A. Is it not really strange that even while the Muslim states were being founded everywhere in the north of India, while they had been so very cruelly ravaging the Hindu religion and Hindu states for two or three centuries, while thousands of Hindu temples were being continuously and insultingly demolished, while Kashi was almost turned into Mecca, while Dnyandev, Namdev and other saints and their followers and millions of travelling Hindu pilgrims were going right up to the Punjab to visit the holy places and were returning aggrieved at the sad plight of Hindu religion there, while the Muslims were openly swearing and voicing their ambition to invade the South and convert it to Islam, the Hindu kings of the South should be so very careless and negligent that instead of collecting their armies and sending them to the north to help the Rajputs to face the Muslim aggression, Ramdevrao's forces under some of his chieftains, should have gone far to the South, and Ramdevrao himself should have been wandering most frivolously with his small army hunting wild animals away from his capital ? But— 
724. Let alone Ramdevrao's state of Devgiri 1 But didn't even a single spy from the secret intelligence service of the four or five prominent Hindu states in the south go to the north and observe and inform his king or kings anything even while the north-Indian Hindus were so pitifully groan­ ing and rending the skies with their miserable cries ? But ! 
B u t !! 
725. Under these circumstances it is no wonder if Ramdevrao was utterly vanquished. Allauddin extorted from Ramdevrao a huge ransom, made him a mandatory prince and went off hurriedly to Delhi because of some political urgency. It was really fortunate that, according to the Muslim custom, the whole state of Ramdevrao was not 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 2 ^ 
immediately turned Muslim. 
726. Eor, Allauddin was busy with his plans to dispatch his uncle, Jalalluddin, as soon as he reached Delhi and to usurp the throne. Accordingly he hatched up a big conspi­ racy and had Jalalluddin killed and himself became the Sultan in A.D. 129624. 
727. Immediately after he became the Sultan he invaded Gujrath in A.D. 1298, and overcoming the Hindu king there conquered the capital of Anhilwad. In the confusion of the battle the beautiful Hindu queen, Kamaldevi, was captured while she was trying to escape, but the defeated Hindu king could slip away with his daughter, Devaldevi. Allauddin thence marched straight into Sourashtra, again demolished the newly built magnificent temple of Sorti Somnath and took away the idol therein to Delhi and used it as a stepping stone for his throne only to add insult to the Hindus' injury'^!. 
728. On reaching Delhi he married Rani Kamaldevi per­ haps with her own consent. That harlot of a woman was not satisfied with mere cohabitation with Allauddin, but requested the Muslim chieftains marching on the south to search out and capture her young, pretty daughter, Princess Devaldevi, and bring her to Delhi into Muslim captivity. 
729. At this time of Allauddin's invasion of Gujrath there was a most handsome, smart, and young lad working as a slave with a wealthy banker. Him Allauddin asked for as lustfully as if he would a girl in marriage. But as the banker refused to part with the young slave, the Sultan angrily seized the lad and carried him away forcibly'*. In those days the Muslims had inherited the vice of sodomy— an unnatural form of sexual intercourse with fair-looking boys instead of with girls—from the A r a b s " , which became an accepted custom in the Muslim community as a whole, being never considered to be irreligious ! According to this general practice Allauddin too had such unnatural sexual relations with this young handsome slave". But that smart slave turned out such an expert swordsman and politician that he actually began to lead the armies on the battle-fields 
290 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
himself with as much ability and skill as Allauddin himself. The aging Allauddin began to call the slave Maliq-Kafur. 
• Later still he began to run the whole administration of the 
•empire with the latter's advice**. 
THE SECOND MUSLIM CAMPAIGN ON RATANBHOR 
730. It has already been told that Jalalludin was defeated by the Hindus of Ratanbhor. In order to avenge that defeat Allauddin marched again for the second time on the fort of Ratanbhor in A.D. 1301'". Even then Rana Hameer of Ratan­ bhor fought to the last and laid down his life along with thousands of his soldiers in that furious battle; and on seeing the fall of the Rajput warriors hundreds of Rajput ladies including Hameer's queen, standing on the ramparts of the fort,'^ lept into the blazing fire according to a pre-settled plan, and burned themselves to death. How often have the Hindu warriors and their brave wives done such magnificent deeds of valour and sacrificed their lives ! That is the only reason why the Hindu nation could still remain alive ! 
INVASIONS OF CHITOD SUBSEQUENT TO THE FALL OF RATANBHOR 
731. The most beautiful daughter of the Rajput king of Ceylon**, named Padmini, was married to Rana Bheemsing of Chitod. According to the shameless but proud vaunt of the Muslims in general that to kidnap the non-Muslim beautiful women openly was a Muslim's religious duty, Allauddin openly demanded from Rana Bheemsing his charm­ ing queen, and as the Rajputs spurned it, Allauddin marched on Chitod round about A . D . 1302. While describing the battles at that time the Rajput history tells a story how in order to deceive Allauddin the Rajputs promised to send P a d m i n i t o h i m b u t a c t u a l l y s e n t a r m e d g a l l a n t fighters disguised as women in several palanquins and successfully executed a daring plan of rescuing the captured Bheemsingh, but the paucity of space prevents us from narrating it in any detail.

•5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 291 
valour even in that furious battle, AUauddin had to return to 
Delhi. This incident clearly shows that Rajputs, too, could 
resort to cunning. 
732. In order to avenge the defeat inflicted by the 
Hajputs in this battle and for the sake of Padmini AUauddin 
once again invaded Chitod in A.D. 1303, when once again 
the brave Rajputs donned the 'Kesaria' (saffron garments) 
^nd faught till the end, slaying hundreds of Muslims, and 
•died to a man. Seeing the victory smile upon the Muslims a.nd 
•fortune darken upon the Rajputs, about ten thousand Rajput 
•women, including Rani Padmini, lept into the blazing fire 
with their children at their breasts'^. AUauddin conquered 
•Chitod, only to collect the ashes of Padmini ! When the 
Hindu warriors and Hindu women fought they fought thus ! 
733. It must be told here that before the old AUauddin 
breathed his last, this defeat of the Hindus was avenged 
under the very nose of AUauddin in A.D.1313 by the famous 
Rajput, Hameer, who conquered Chitod, after inflicting a 
crushing defeat upon the Muslims. He even captured a son of 
AUauddin alive'*—but he was not converted to Hinduism. He 
should have been at least to pay the enemy in its own coin ! 
This is the very same suicidal generosity of the Hindus. 
734. In A.D.1307 this Maliq Kafur, Allauddin's famed 
general, was sent by the Sultan to invade the south. 
Ramdevrao was once again defeated*^, but he made peace 
by paying off the accumulated ransom. But during this 
turmoil the runaway Princess Devaldevi of Gujrath who 
was married to Ramdevrao's son Shankardev was captured 
-and sent to Delhi by Maliq Kafur^^. Soon after in A.D. 1308 
be invaded the Deccan for the third time and defeated in a 
bloody action Raja Pratapdev of VarangaP^, the heroic king 
who had once vanquished the Muslims^8_ jj^ja Pratapdev 
had to swear allegiance to the Sultanate at Delhi. 
735. Flushed at this success Maliq Kafur marched on 
the third Hindu State in the Deccan and defeated the Hoysal 
king** there likewise. Kafur's victorious sword then subdued 
the remaining Hindu kingdom of Madura. 
292 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
7 3 6 . T h u s f o r t h e first, t i m e d u r i n g t h e p a s t t w o 
tJ^pusand years practically the whole of the Deccan passed 
into foreign and non-Hindu enemy hands*" ! The independence 
and prosperity of the Deccan came to an end in this year ! At 
the Southern-most end of the Deccan Maliq Kafur built a fine 
Masjid as if to commemorate this Muslim conquest of South 
India. Bub the Hindu reaction to it was to precipitate the 
successful Hindu conspiracies against Muslim bondage. 
737. Ramdevrao's son, Shankardev, succeeded him to 
the throne of Devgiri, and soon repudiated the oath of allegi­ 
ance to Sultan AUauddin, whereupon Maliq Kafur swooped 
down on the Deccan once again. Shankardev did not surren­ 
der till the last and fought furiously till he was killed*^. 
738. As AUauddin and Maliq Kafur stamped out the 
Hindu political power from the Deccan during their frequent 
invasions, they likewise crumbled to dust the huge and 
magnificent Hindu temples of the South*^, cut up their 
golden pinnacles and in majority of the cases built palatial 
Masjids on their sites*'; forced thousands of Hindus to be 
converted**. These innumerable converted Hindus made 
big farming and feudal estates in this Deccan itself. But 
Hindus, however, did not massacre these Muslims nor did 
they destroy them outright as and when they subdued the 
Muslim power later on. This is what we call the perversion 
of the concept of virtues ! 
MOST OFTEN THE HINDUS USED THE SAME WAR- STRATEGY OF THE MUSLIMS, ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY SCIENCE OF THE TIME 
739. On the religious front the Hindus were thus 
being vanquished mostly because of their own foolish 
religious concepts and traditions, but on the political front 
they were fighting with the Muslims, as they ought to have 
done ! Even after being completely overcome they rose 
again and again and defeated the Muslims ! Craftiness and 
cunning were generally matched with the sanie strategic 
moves by the Hindus ! 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 293 
740. AUauddin surpassed every other Sultan before 
him in cruelty in the persecution of the Hindus*^, He would 
have reached greater heights in cruelty in respect of his 
treatment of the Hindus had he not been forced to fight 
on the other front with the Mongols who unceasingly hurled 
their armed might against the western borders of India and 
caused a great turmoil throughout Mongolia and Central 
Asia. A few of them took to Islam and formed a new Muslim 
colony in Delhi itself. At last the enraged AUauddin cut off 
the whole of this new Muslim colony to a man** ! 
DEATH OF ALLAUDDIN 
741. AUauddin was the first and the last Muslim Sultan 
to rule over practically the whole of India with the exception 
of some Hindu stabes like those of Chitod and others. 
Neither Akbar nor even Aurangzeb can take that place, as 
their territories never equalled those of AUauddin. 
742. But in his old age AUauddin was sorely afllicted 
by his bodily diseases which were the outcome of his physical 
vices*'. Naturally he became a tool in the hands of Maliq 
Kafur, and in that miserable state this valorous but Hindu- 
hater Sultan died of dropsy in A.D.1316 or as it is said, 
Maliq Kafur killed him or had him killed**. His 'Allah' 
could not bless him with a happy death because of his virtue 
of Hindu-hatred ! In a few days Maliq Kafur, a one-time 
slave of AUauddin, usurped the whole power of AUauddin, 
but in the political chaos that ensued after AUauddin he 
was soon killed**. In the turbulent days that followed a 
certain Khushrukhan of exceptional abilities, who had 
been shining in the diplomatic circles at Delhi, rose to the 
highest seat of power. From the point of view of the 
Hindu nation his story deserves a separate chapter in the 
history of India. 
CHAPTER XVII 
KHUSHRUKHAN AND DEVALDEVI 
743. If the millions of students who are learning history in all the states in the Indian Uaion today are asked what they know of Khushrukhan a unique unforget­ table character, who was acclaimed as the Sultan of Sultans in the Muslim Sultanate at Delhi and who was worthy of high praise from the point of view of the Hindus, it is more likely than not that at least 93 p.e. of these millions of students will reply with evident surprise, "Khushrukhan ? No, we heaven't come across any major reference to such a man as you describe !" Let alone the students ! But even if you were to ask the same question to the teachers in genera], to the whole editorial staff of the newspapers in India or even to any educated man or woman, at least 75 p.c, of them will very probably reply in the same manner ; "Who is this Khushrukhan ? We have never heard even of his name !" 744. It is for this very reason that we are attempting to give a brief sketch of his life and work, as far as we can do so with the available evidence. For although he is a unique character in the modern Indian history, his name has been obliterated, as it were, by the Muslim historians and their blind foreign and Indian, Hindu followers, from the text-books of history used in schools, for his sole offence of putting the Muslim Sultanate to shame in order to avenge the wrongs and insults hurled by them at the Hindu nation. Whatever he has been mentioned, he has been given the most insulting and abusive attributes like, 'low-bred',, 'depraved', 'a knave', 'a hell-hound' by the Muslim writers^. 
THE EARLY HISTORY OF KHUSHRUKHAN 
745. When in the reign of AUauddin, Gujrath had to 
5TH GtORIOUS EPOCH 
face the first onslaught of the Muslims in A.D. 1298 and the governing authority of the Hindus was much shaken down, 
in the chaotic conditions then jprevailing, a very tender,: attractive but very brilliant Hindu youth had been captured and made a slave by the Muslim noblemen and was offered into the service of AUauddin^, much the same way and for the same reason as M a l i q K a f u r was made a slave. Thia youth was originally a Hindu, belonging to thCiUntouchable caste of Paria or Parwar (sweepers) in Gujrath'. One or two Muslim writers deny that he was a Paria (sweeper), but emphatically assert that he was a Rajput. After having been captured and converted to Islam, he was first called 'Hasan*, When he was taken in the service of AUauddin at Delhi, in keeping with the social vice of the Muslims {viz., sodomy paragraph 729) the greatest noblemen and generals of the court had unnatural sexual relations with him, and so they were extremely solicitous about serving his whims .' When after Allauddin's death in A.D. 1316 Maliq Kafur became the chief administrator, he also came to have great regard for his abilities. Very soon Hasan was given the title of Khushrukhan^. For even in the days of AUauddin he was being sent independently on some small military expeditions in charge of small troops. That Hasan should become Khushrukhan and then a general in the army so rapidly bespeaks of his exceptional qualities. But more than these qualities of his limitless love that Mubarik, the son of AUauddin, bore towards this charming young man was responsible for such a spectacular rise. So after both AUauddin and Maliq Kafur died or were dispatched, as the case may be, Mubarik got the Sultanate of Delhi mainly with Khushru- khan's assistance, and quite naturally all the reins of the government passed easily into the hands of Khushrukhan*, the dearest, ablest and the most trustworthy young nobleman of Mubarik's court; and young Khushrukhan, too, proved wholly efficient in the discharge of his responsible job. Mubarik was vicious and pleasure-seeking by nature'. There­ fore he considered it a god-sent gift to have such an efficient 
296 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
assistant in the person of Khushrukhan to run the whole administration and especially a loyal executive to manage his private affairs in the harem. 
DEVALDEVI 
746. When in the court of Delhi the attractive Maliq 
Kafur, who was born a Hindu but converted by AUauddin 
to Islam, became later on the commander-in-chief and an 
astute politician, practically at the same time rose in status 
another young, handsome, Hindu convert, Khushrukhan, 
who after the death of Maliq Kafur, wielded all authority 
at the court of Delhi. In a similar way and simultaneously 
enough rose a third figure in the political circles at Delhi, 
who was equally important, able, and who managed the 
affairs of the state only with the twitch of her eye-brows, 
and her sidelong glances—I mean the former Hindu princess 
of Gujrath and the some-time wife of Shankardev Yadav of 
Devgiri, namely Devaldevi. 
747. Of these three Hindu converts Maliq Kafur seems 
later on to have wholly turned a Muslim, even mentally, 
completely forgetting his Hindu origin, the Hindu blood 
running through his veins, his Hindu parentage, let alone his 
love for all these ! But Khushrukhan and this royal princess 
of Gujrath, Devaldevi, seem to have borne in their mind not 
only the memory, but a love, a fascination for their Hindu 
origin, their Hindu blood, and their essential Hindu make-up; 
there seems to be rankling in their hearts, intermittently or 
continuously the atrocities inflicted on them by the MusUms. 
It seemed to burst out through their actions. At last it is 
because of their irrepressible yearning to avenge the wrongs 
done to their 'Hindutwa' that in Delhi itself broke out that 
great conflagration which like the wild fire of Khandav forest 
of Mahabharat reduced to ashes the Muslim Sultanate which 
had under its sway practically the whole of India, if only for 
a short while ! 
748. In the very first expedition of AUauddin against 
Gujrath, after the Gujrath ruler's defeat his crowned queen 
5TH OnORIOUS EPOCH ' 297 
Kanaaldevi fell into the hands of Alla.uddin while she was -fleeing for safety*. Btit the ruler, however, could effect his escape along with his princely daughter, Devaldevi, a mere 
•child then. Used to aU sorts of royal comforts and pleasures till the very previous day as she was how hard and unbear­ able might this tender and beautiful royal princess have found it to undergo all the calamities and privations and 
•exertions of wandering for days together through forest ^fter forest and trying to evade the ever present possibility of capture by the pursuing Muslims might easily be imagined. In that tender age hatred for the Muslims must have been engraved deeply on her bosom because of other people's and her own actual experience. Her very mother, IRani Kamaldevi, had become the beloved queen of Sultan -AUauddin at Delhi, and that very mother of hers was now 
•out to seize her and make her a Muslim ! How painful must this news have been to her tender heart ! In order to evade this terrible fate she was married, even a little against her father's wishes to Ramdevrao's son, Shankardev, the staunch follower of Hinduism. But her evil star did not leave her 
•alone there. In one of the invasions of Maliq Kafur against the Hindus, she was caught and carried away to Delhi as a captive. She must have been smarting with pain and humiliation a hundred thousand times in that moment of 'despair ! At last on reaching Delhi she was forced to marry Khijrakhan', the eldest son of AUauddin. Some writers vouch that Devaldevi and Khijrakhan greatly loved each 
•otheri". But this seems to be the flattering way of the courtly writers. Her subsequent course of action makes it abundantly 
•clear ! But that shrewd Hindu princess seems to have affected her love for Islam and for her husband till she got the desired opportunity. 
749. It becomes crystal-clear from the latter part of her life that after all the atrocities and persecutions she was constantly worshipping the Hindu god. 
760. Even after being forced to marry Allauddin's 
•eldest son, the mental agonies ot Devaldevi did not cease. 
298 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
For, immediatly after Allauddin's death there was a revolu-- 
tion in which Allauddin's second son, Mubarik, attacked and 
blinded his brother along with his followers and then put 
them to death. Installing himself as the Sultan,, he seized 
his brother's wife, Devaldevi, and forced her to marry him"' 
751. This alone seems to be the civilized and polite' 
tradition of the Muslim Sultans and Emperors—to marry 
again the fairest of queens and wives of the late Sultans or • 
Emperors, dead or put to death ! 
752. This way did the former Hindu princess, Devaldevi 
rise to the highest status of a Sultana ! However, she 
abhorred Mubarik most bitterly; yet she had perforce to keep • 
marital relations with him. Although her precious body- 
was thus continually defiled, she had the most favourite 
opportunity of her life owing to this marriage of hers with. 
Mubarik. 
753. In gaining the Sultanate of Delhi Mubarik had 
mainly to depend on the former Hindu slave, who later on. 
was forced to become a Muslim, and who now had become the - 
commander-in-chief of the whole Sultanate of Delhi—namely 
Khushrukhan ! Mubarik himself had willingly entrusted the 
whole administration to Khushrukhan for he had no time to • 
mind other things except every sort of depravity and vice^*. 
For instance he was extremely fond of dressing like a woman, 
going to the greatest noblemen of the court with the whole- 
band of dancing girls, and there dancing himself or having 
dancing and musical concerts there^'. So while this licentious- 
Mubarik was fully engrossed with his various vices, his - 
chief minister of state, Khushrukhan, who had the burning 
memory of his former Hindu life, and his present wife but 
the former Hindu princess, Devaldevi, who had similar- 
thoughts and tendencies and similar mishaps in life as the 
former—both being Gujrathi Hindus originally—had the • 
greatest opportunity of coming into closest contact, of deve­ 
loping the strongest love-ties and the greatest confidence in 
each other. They could carry on the day-to-day political 
intrigues and plans, authoritatively and with impunity even i 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 299*. 
in the solitude of the innermost secret chambers of the* Sultan's private palace. 
754. It has to be taken for granted from the later course of events that it is there that they must have hatched some important conspiracy for the benefit of Hinduism. 
755. The first proof th&t contributes to this assertion i&- that Khushrukhan appointed his former Hindu Paria or Parwar brother to the governorship of Gujrath, his native province^*. 
756. The second very important pointer : Khushrukhan appointed openly in Delhi itself for his own protection thousands of his former Hindu warrior compatriots—at least twenty to thirty thousand strong—in the Muslim army^^. 
757. TAe 7%z>rf Po/n/er : These manoeuvres of his were- highly resented to by many of the Muslim grandees^'. But the- innermost intention behind them all was kept so very secret that it is doubtful whether ii; had by that time become so crystal clear to Devaldevi or even to Khushrukhan himself, let alone the others ! Faintly and slowly yet surely enough was that intention taking shape in their minds. 
758 The Fourth Pointer : Khushrukhan incited the most, incapable Sultan like Mubarik to lead an expedition to the South to put down in good time the rebellions of the conquered Hindus in the Deccan, and he himself accompanied) him as second-in-command. The Hindus were worsted a lot^'- Their immeasurable wealth taken as spoils of war^ filled the Sultan's treasury. Most probably it is during this- expedition that after the death of Shankardev of Devgiri,. his relative. King Harpaldev, rebelled and founded the kingdom of Devgiri once again, for which he was defeated' and ordered by the Sultan to be skinned alive and then put to death!* ! And for defence of his religion the royal Hindu warrior bore it bravely. 
759. Thereafter Mubarik returned with his army to- Delhi. Because of these deeds of valour of his for the sake of a Muslim Sultan and the Muslim state and because of hi» devastation of the Hindus, his rival Muslim grandees, too,. 300 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
couJd not breathe a single word against his unshakable faith 
in the Islamic religion. They could at the most only whisper 
that there was danger of his overthrowing Sultan Mubarik 
and become the Sultan himself in his stead. But that he would 
be a Muslim Sultan and none else, there was not the least 
doubt. 760. But if at this very time that future conspiracy of 
a Hinduistic revolution, which was very strange and unheard 
of before, had germinated in the minds of K h u s h r u k h a n and 
Devaldevi, it must have been kept highly secret with utmost 
caution^*. 
761. Very soon Mubarik sent Khushrukhan to the 
Deccan for an extensive conquest, but he himself did not go 
with him. So (thorough) complete was his faith in Khushru­ 
khan ! In this expedition Khushrukhan subdued the King 
of Malabar too, and exacted therefrom immeasurable plunder 
in the name of Sultan Mubarik^" ! 
BUT 
762. But in this very campaign of South India various 
open or secret Hindu conspiracies against the Muslim empire 
began to brew up from various quarters of the South Indian 
peninsula. The royal Hindu families of Varangal and 
<3ujrath, the valiant Eana Hameer, the redeemer of Chitod, 
and other Hindu Chiefs, the religious leaders and propagan­ 
dists in the various religious institutions and monasteries 
like those of the Shankaracharya and even the common 
people were becoming restless and agitated with a common 
a,ntagonism to the Muslim domination. A n d anonymous 
complaints by Khushrukhan's enemies had reached the ears 
of the Sultan of Delhi to the effect that Khushrukhan was 
in some mysterious way and most secretly connected with 
this universal discontent^! ! 
763. So scanty and self-contradictory bits of informa­ 
tion are available in the writings of the contemporary 
Muslim writers about this Khushrukhan, the conqueror of 
Malabar, and the whole of the Muslim empire that we have 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 301 
to correlate them into some sort of a consistent account, only 
as far as it is possible, from the later happenings .' Once in 
the open court of the Sultan at Delhi there was a rumour 
which apprehended that instead of coming back to Delhi 
amongst the ring of his adversaries Khushrukhan was about 
to escape to some neighbouring foreign island by sea with 
the immense wealth he had amassed in the South. One 
Muslim writer^* has gone to the length of saying that 
Khushrukhan was brought back to Delhi in fetters ! 
764. With an exceptional daring and abillity to cut off 
the strings of the net of inimical conspiracies with one 
stroke, Khushrukhan at once declared his intention to go 
back to Delhi in the grand manner of the conqueror of the 
South with all his army. For, his secret accomplice, the 
former Hindu princess but now the Muslim empress, Deval­ 
devi, must have been keeping him posted with every detail 
of the daily happenings at Delhi ! 
765. Prom the few English translations of the Muslim 
books of the time which are now available even those who 
do not know either Persian or Arabic can have some inform­ 
ation. Most of the Muslim writers mention Khushrukhan 
with utmost scorn and finish him within four or five lines 
only. The reason is plain enough. The Muslim historians 
can never bear with equanimity Khushrukhan's taking the 
conceit out of the Muslim rule at Delhi. Even these Muslim 
historians have found it at places improper to distort and 
garble up the truth about Khushrukhan or to suppress it 
altogether. Their manuscripts, especially the recently 
published ones, prove very useful in this respeet. Even the 
account by the recent Hindu historians, who based their 
conclusions on the above mentioned old Muslim books, is to 
that extent useless. The Hindu writers have done nothing 
more than merely repeating the obloquies like 'mean-minded', 
'shameless', 'dastardly', hurled at him by the Muslim writers. 
But there are two honourable exceptions to this general 
tendency : one is that of the veteran historian Riasatkar 
Sardesai and the other of Shree Munshi*». These two 
;302 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
ihistorians, however, have given a comparative account of 
Khushrukhan and Devaldevi, too, and have attempted to 
«,ppraise, though very faintly and cursorily, the great revolu­ 
tion they had finally effected to establish a Hindu empire. 
But theirs is a half-hearted attempt which fears its own 
conclusions and which could never fully grasp nor could 
•explain the real implications and nature of that unpreced­ 
ented revolution. A contemporary Hindu writer, who could 
elucidate the Hindu side of this great event is, obviously 
•enough, not to be found ! For no Hindu of the time could 
have even dared to express his own independent opinions or 
judgment. 
766. Under these circumstances, it is only possible to 
give in the form of a connected narrative the obvious conclu- 
'Sions that can be drawn from what little consistency can be 
found in the disconnected reports in the above-mentioned 
•original Muslim writings and the actual undisputed acts df 
the leading personalities like Khushrukhan, Devaldevi and 
•others. 
767. As already told above, Khushrukhan went to 
Delhi with his victorious army and the immense spoUs he 
had gathered in the Deccan. But why did he go there ? Not 
•only in Delhi but even in the Deccan a political rumour was 
secretly disseminated amongst the Hindu political circles 
that the Hindu leaders who were organizing Hindu revolts 
in the south against the Muslims were in collusion with 
Khushrukhan about some deep-laid conspiracy to disrupt 
the Muslim empire**. In Gujrath Khushrukhan's brother 
himself was the de facto ruler, while all the Rajputs were 
inspired by Rana Hameer to overthrow the India-wide 
unitary Muslim empire, the first of its kind, at least till that 
•day. And most wonderful of all was the fact that Sultan 
Mubarik's supreme commander and chief administrator, 
-Khushrukhan himself, working as he was directly under 
Sultana Devaldevi's confidential orders, was taken in confi- 
•dence by the Rajput leaders in respect of this daring plot to 
•establish a Hindu empire ! Such a rare concurrence of 
^TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 303 
-opposing forces is bound to astound history itself ! Stand to 
reason it never can, till at least something miraculous 
happens. 
768. But something of the kind did begin to shape itself 
at the time. In the fiery brains of Sultana Devaldevi and 
-Khushrukhan there really was seething some such extraordi­ 
narily magnificent and by its very nature almost an 
incredible idea or plan which seemed possible only to some 
mysterious intrigue and daring of a Nursinh*^ ! 
769 But neither their enemies nor their friends could 
breathe it openly ! For with what magic wand was this 
-supreme commander of Mubarik—the commander, who had 
brought all the Hindu states in the Deccan to meek submis- 
•sion before the Muslim Sultan^*—who had very recently 
-devastated the wealthy Hindu kingdom of Malabar and hoisted 
there the green Muslim flag of the Delhi Sultanate*'—and 
who, above all, had come to Delhi to lay down all that 
success, all that glory, as an humble homage at the feet of 
the Muslim emperor,—how was he, the sole supporter of the 
-India-wide foreign and non-Hindu empire,— he, who, born 
though he was as a Hindu, had become converted to 
llslam—how was a man of such a status likely to transform 
so suddenly the whole Muslim empire into a Hindu one ? 
:No staunch Muslim could even dare express it openly. Khu­ 
shrukhan and Devaldevi had been keeping up till the last 
rthe pretence of their being die-hard Muslims and of their 
greatest loyalty to the Muslim Sultan and his empire so 
scrupulously and thoroughly that even their direst enemies 
who had dark suspicions of their having underground connec­ 
tions with the Hindu rulers feared that were they personally 
to charge Khushrukhan before the Sultan in Delhi or in the 
•open court, the Sultan would point out proofs to the cont­ 
rary and outwit them forthwith. Even the top-level Muslim 
-officials feared this eventuality. Whatever complaints had 
reached the general populace of Delhi or the ears of the Sultan 
bimself were so baseless and completely anonymous that 
aiobody creditted them with any more veracity or seriousness 
304 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORT 
than they would do hearsay reports or false accusations by 
some mischief-mongers ! 
770. As soon as he came to Delhi Sultan Mubarik did. 
not put him under heavy fetters and custody, as his Muslim- 
enemies had expected, but being extremely pleased with the 
immense treasure Khushrukhan had laid at his feet and the 
unlimited power he had gained for the Delhi Sultanate, 
Mubarik on the contrary conferred upon Khushrukhan the 
administrative, military, civic and all other residual autho­ 
rity. And if he had put anybody under arrest it was the- 
great Muslim noblemen and Khankhanas of the court who 
were dismissed for charging Khushrukhan unreservedly. 
770-A. On the other hand, in the regime of Khushrukhan 
as the chief administrator the strictest bans against the 
Hindus introduced by AUauddin in former days were now 
being gradually relaxed; the exploitation of the Hindu-Muslim, 
farmers and the people in general also was stopped; the 
Hindus, too, got much relief in matters reUgious; the common 
discontent amongst the subjects against the tyrannical rule 
of the emperors was on the wane. And the whole credit of 
this comparatively happy state of things began to go very 
naturally to Khushrukhan, who was the chief of the imperial 
administration at that time. Gradually by Sultan the- 
common people came to understand, not the vicious and. 
good-for-nothing Mubarik, but his all in all, valiant and. 
popular administrator, Khushrukhan, and behind him loomed 
the Sultana, Devaldevi, with whose internal and open support 
he could wield this authority. 
771. The Hindus began to look upon Khushrukhan as 
their saviour, even though he was still a Muslim, because he 
had set them free to a great extent from the vexatious taxes- 
and restrictions imposed on them by AUauddin and the un­ 
told humiliation they had to undergo. Khushrukhan began 
to be popular amongst the Muslim farmers and other citizens 
because of the reUef they got from heavy taxes. And above 
everything else because of his military exploits which had 
resounded throughout the whole of India and his.superb 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 305 
adroitness in state-craft many of the high-ranking Muslim 
noblemen had enlisted themselves on his side. 
772. Seeing such a favourable opportunity Khushrukhan 
and Devaldevi thought the right moment had come for them 
to proclaim boldly their grand scheme of a political revolu­ 
tion—for one who hesitates to undertake this hazard under 
favourable circumstances must be a coward who would 
accomplish no daring feat ! It was not merely a coup d'etat 
in a small state; it was an imperial revolution, which sought 
to subvert the India-wide, unitary and danger-free Muslim 
empire of the late AUauddin and of the present Mubarik and 
to establish in its place overnight, most unexpectedly, a 
H i n d u empire all over India. It was a religious revolution 
in as much as it sought to pull down the enthroned Muslim 
religion and to supplant it by the Hindu Vedic religion. 
773. That such a perfect revolution was most difficult— 
almost impossible—to be accomplished, even if Hindu-Muslim 
wars were to be fought continuously for five hundred years, 
was quite plain from the Arab invasions of Sindh in the 
seventh century and the later history of Muslim invasions 
till the time of AUauddin. But such a complete revolution 
was in fact brought about by the exceptional genius of Khu­ 
shrukhan and Devaldevi, even if it was only for a short 
while ! 
774. Had not the Muslim Sultanate conquered the 
H i n d u s c o m p l e t e l y b y h a r d fighting f o r c e n t u r i e s t o g e t h e r 
and turned their country wholly Muslim ? Then if Khushru­ 
khan was able to wrench the imperial authority from the 
single Sultan and if he were to ascend the throne of the Delhi 
Sultanate in the name of Hinduism, then the whole of the 
empire would necessarily be a 'Hindu' one, with one stroke ! 
Then the Muslim Sultan would necessarily become a Hindu 
emperor. This feat was as daring in planning as it was easy 
in execution under those circumstances ! It was quite possi­ 
ble too. It is this magic wand that Devaldevi, originally a 
Hindu princess, and Khushrukhan, the original Hindu Paria. 
youth, wielded which worked as an unparallelled miracle not 
306 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
•only in Indian but in the whole human history ! 
776. Having arranged every minute detail of the future 
revolution most secretly, Khushrukhan humbly requested 
'Sultan Mubarik, who had willingly allowed himself to be 
•governed completely by the former: "The thousands of 
Sindus of my caste whom I have stationed in Delhi want to 
be converted to Islam with proper religious ceremony; but 
they are fighting shy of doing so openly in the city. Some 
•of them are really afraid to do so. Hence 1 wish to bring 
the choicest amongst them into the palace today and convert 
them in due course"**. Under this pretext Kiushrukhan 
'brought the hundreds of his bravest Hindu warriors in Delhi 
into the palace and housed them in the barracks for the impe­ 
rial guards**. One day in A.D. 1319, at the dead of night 
suddenly there was a great turmoil in the palace in the midst 
of which Sultan Mubarik was killed^**. 
776. But many had been the tumults and turmoils 
•causing change of rulers before this. Sultan AUauddin him­ 
self was similarly dispatched. Sultan Mubarik had dealt 
with Maliq Kafur in this very way. The city of Delhi which 
was quite used to such turmoils began to whisper the next 
morning : "What terrible things happened in the palace 
last night ?" 
777. Within a very short time only a single proclama­ 
tion of a political nature gave a violent shock, as that of an 
earthquake, to the whole capital and brought to it the rude 
realization that the previous night Khushrukhan's people 
had effected at one and the same time an imperial and religi­ 
ous revolution by putting Sultan Mubarik to death, and it 
was immediately followed by another that Khushrukhan had 
installed himself as a Sultan'^ ! 
778. However there was nowhere to be seen any imme­ 
diate, open and organized opposition amongst the people to 
this unprecedented revolution. The fact that the new Sultan 
Khushrukhan married Sultana Devaldevi^*, the queen of 
Mubarik, as soon as the latter was killed, stirred the revolu­ 
tionary curiosity of the people but did not overawe them f 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 307 
J'or that was the age-old tradition of the earlier Sultans ! 
Kutubuddin's widows were married to the later Sultans who 
succeeded him, while Allauddin's and his son's, Khijrakhan's 
widow, this very Devaldevi, was espoused by Mubarik him­ 
self. Quite consistent with this time-honoured tradition 
•was this act of Khushrukhan of marrying Devaldevi, the 
widow of the late Sultan Mubarik, with whom he bad 
•established very close contacts much earlier and who was 
really his partner and perhaps a source of inspiration ! Why 
should it not then seem quite natural to everybody in the 
•state ? 
BUT—! 
779. But more startling than this was another procla­ 
mation made authoritatively and with every political 
formality by Khushrukhan and Devaldevi which suddenly 
turned this political revolution in the royal palace into a 
religious one of a unique nature*'. Everybody in India right 
from the Kings and Nawabs to the Farias and Parwars, 
Mahars and Mangs was thrilled with a strange sensation at 
this unique proclamation ! The Hindus were thrilled with 
unlimited joy while the Muslims were filled with the darkest 
apprehensions. The said pro.clamation made by Sultan 
Khushrukhan himself from his throne on the 15th April, 1320 
meant to say: 
780. 'Although till today I was forced to lead the most 
•detestable life of a convert to Islam, I am originally a son 
of a Hindu. The mainspring of my life is Hinduism and 
the blood that throbs into my veins and arteries is that of a 
Hindu. Now that I have won independent and powerful 
status of a Sultan for myself I am hereby breaking off the 
shackles of conversion to a foreign religion, and I do hereby 
declare that I am a Hindu ! I have now ascended publicly 
the throne of the vast and entire, undivided India'as a Hindu 
Emperor ! Similarly Sultana Devaldevi till very recently 
was originally a Hindu daughter. Her husband, the Raja 
of Devgiri, Shankardev Yadav, was most brutally murdered 
308 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
and she was treacherously captured from her father sneaking 
miserably through dense forests to avoid seizure by the enemy. 
She was brought to Delhi and put to shame and ignominous 
disgrace by being forced to marry Khijrakhan, in the first 
place, and secondly after his brutal murder. Sultan Mubarik 
who was killed in the coup d'etat last night. That Devaldevi 
is my queen, the empress of Hindustan of today ! Being 
o r i g i n a l l y H i n d u i n flesh a n d b l o o d a n d a H i n d u r o y a l 
princess, she also hereafter renounces disdainfully her 
shameful conversion to Islam and henceforth will lead her life 
strictly according to Hindu religion ! May this solemn vow 
of ours absolve us both of our former sin of forceful 
conversion !' 
781. To refute or to challenge a proclamation of this 
nature came forth no stronger Hindu, nor even a single 
Muslim !. 
782. Hence, hereafter, we are going to address Sultan 
Khushrukhan as a Hindu Emperor and Devaldevi as a Hindu 
Empress ! 
783. This Hindu Emperor did not however disclose his 
original Hindu name of his young years ! Most probably he 
had no recollection of it whatsoever; today it is eternally 
lost. The imperial title that he adopted for himself was 
also a Muslim one, viz., Nasir-ud-din ! The reason for this, 
perhaps, was that the whole of the Muslim-world and even 
the millions of Hindus who were used to Muslim titles for 
generations together might not be scandalized in respect of 
these minor details also. Nasir-ud-din, roughly speaking, 
means a sort of a defender of faith or religion ! Hence this 
Hindu Emperor made it clear in the said proclamation that 
the 'Din' or religion that he was going to defend was not 
Islam ! Naturally it must be the Hindu religion ! It is, 
therefore, proper that his name Nasir-ud-din should be 
translated as the Defender of Hindu Religion'—Hindu 
dharmarakshak ! 
5 TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 309 
THE UNPRECEDENTED REVOLUTION ! 
784. As soon as this unheard of revolution, transform­ 
ing the India-wide Muslim Empire into the Hindu one 
suddenly within a day, was accomplished, this Hindu 
Emperor disbursed amongst the thousands of soldiers of his 
caste the immense wealth which he had pillaged in his 
conquest of Malabar by vanquishing the Hindu states and 
which had filled the coffers of the late Sultan Mubarik, along 
with the unlimited wealth accumulated during the regimes 
of the former Sultans. Similarly he increased the pay- 
scales of both the Hindu and Muslim soldiers. Having won 
over his soldiery in this way, he introduced new reforms, 
gave to the farmers and common Hindu-Muslim citizens 
facilities and allowed them concessions which they were 
never allowed to enjoy by any of the former Sultans ! 
Likewise, he set free thousands of Hindu prisoners who were 
interned as a diversion in religious persecution and the 
hundreds of Muslims who were imprisoned simply because 
they were repugnant to the former Sultans for one reason or 
another. No wonder if this Hindu Emperor, Dharmarakshak, 
immediately became popular amongst the Hindus as well as 
the Muslims throughout his empire^* ' 
785. It is needless to say that he also absolved all the 
Hindus of all the humiliating bans on their pilgrimages and 
holy baths. The Jizia tax was repealed and other degrading 
conditions which had been enforced upon them by Sultan 
after Sultan were ameliorated forthwith. What wonder then 
if the whole Hindu world felt a thrill of joy and freedom that 
at long last they had a saviour ! 
786. Even when this Hindu Samrat was fighting in the 
guise of a converted Muslim, victoriously in the South and 
reducing Malabar, he had been formulating the scheme of the 
future revolution. So all the big Hindu-Muslim officers and 
generals in the fighting forces who depended on his patronage 
and who had risen mainly because of his support, of course, 
remained loyal to him for safeguarding cheir own selfish 
interests and also for protecting themselves from the malice 310 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
and enmity of the old Muslim Khans, Nizams, and other 
co-religionists of theirs*^. For as a natural consequence of 
intermingling of the two religious communities Muslims 
serving in the armies of many Hindu States had come to form 
a habit of rendering loyal service to their Hindu masters 1 
The political service of a Hindu King was taboo formerly 
when the Muslims first came to India, but by this time the 
taboo had lost its intensity and in its stead such a loyal 
service rendered to a Hindu master came to be considered 
quite in conformity with the Muslim religious code ! Many 
incidents illustrating this point have already occurred so far, 
and will occur in the following pages too**. Although accept­ 
ance of any high office under a Hindu ruler was no more 
considered contrary to the Muslim religious law, the staunch 
Moulanas and Moulavis, however, looked upon such acts as 
necessary exceptions and bore a secret grudge in their hearts 
that they were time bombs laid under the Muslim political 
power ! Never from the very beginning did the Hindus 
consider it contrary to their religious code to fight in the 
Muslim army on the side of the Muslims ! It was only the 
exchange of food and women in marriage with the Muslims 
which endangered the sanctity of their religion ! How 
foolish and suicidal to think so ! 
786-A. This Hindu Emperor did not rest with the mere 
declaration of his adherence to Hinduism, but he fearlessly 
began to bring it into action in the presence of the Muslims. 
Idols of Hindu gods and goddesses were immediately installed 
in the holiest of places of Muslim civilization, the Diwan-i- 
am and Diwan-i-Khas in the royal palaces of Delhi. All the 
worships and all the religious rites in royal palaces began to 
be performed according to the Hindu ritual. Loud cho.nting 
of Hindu mantras and singing of Hindu devotional songs took 
the place of the 'Ayats' in the Koran ! This Hindu Emperor 
himself and the hundreds amongst his old Hindu battalions 
who had remained Hindus from the beginning and who were 
guarding the royal palace paid scrupluous attention to the 
protection and proper worship of these new idols of Hindu Gods 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 311 
and Goddesses". The enthusiasm and vigour of the Hindu 
citizens and especially of the Hindu soldiers in the capital 
knew no bounds ! Just as formerly the aggressive Muslims 
completely demolished the godly idols in the Hindu temples- 
and turned them into Muslim masjids immediately after they 
conquered any Hindu capital, so did these counter-revolu­ 
tionary Hindus install new images of their Gods in every 
masjid as a retaliatory measure, and most ceremoniously 
converted the masjids into Hindu temples and filled them 
with loud chanting of mantras. It is only by this counter­ 
attack of the Hindu Parias that the fanatic Muslims could 
ever have had any idea of the pangs of humiliation and 
grief that might have rankled in the hearts of the Hindu 
community which had grown feeble because of their malady 
of religious tolerance, when the Muslims polluted the Hindu 
temples by cow-slaughter and turned them into masjids. 
787. It might be true that in the heat and excitement of 
this unheard of and unprecedented religious revolution the 
Muslim scriptures, as some Muslim writers charge**, might 
have been exposed to ridicule or shame. But at least the 
Muslims who considered as Gazis those scoundrels who des­ 
troyed the whole university of Nalanda in flames and sat 
warming themselves at that bonfire and laughed scornfully 
and shamelessly as the valuable religious books of the 
Hindus were being reduced to ashes, had no moral right 
whatsoever to blame this incendiarism against the Muslim 
religion ! 
787- A. This Hindu Samrat converted with their willing 
consent the young wives, daughters and nieces of the earlier 
Sultans and other Muslim women to Hinduism and married 
them to his Hindu Paria followers*^. 
788- 789. But more than this, this Hindu Dharmarakshak 
did not do ! Even the Muslim historians do not mention any 
atrocities or religious persecution or plunder as having been 
committed by this Hindu Emperor, as the Muslim aggressors 
were wont to do after overpowering any Hindu State. As 
against the wholesale forcible conversion of Hindus, the 
312 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
brutal ravaging of Hindu women, the reckless destruction of 
Hindu property and temples the Muslim historians have no 
grievous crime to attribute (impute) to this Hindu Emperor ! 
Even if he had committed the very same atrocities on the 
Muslim community as a revenge against the Muslim diabolism 
towards the hapless Hindus, it would have been not a whit 
derogatory, but a l l the more glorious for this revolutionary 
Hindu Emperor ! The non-Hindu aggressors would have 
taken the fright of their lives as never before, and it would 
have proved a deterrent to their perfidious activities ! We 
have already made it amply clear that it is only fierce reta­ 
liation that destroys atrocity, root and branch ! 
•/QO. But the main reason why this Defender of Faith 
(Dharmarakshak Nasir-ud-din) did not commit any such 
revengeful atrocities on the Muslims must probably be his 
keen sense of the strength and weakness of his side. Were 
the whole of the Hindu community in the Indian sub-conti­ 
nent and the ruling Hindu kings of the time to lend him 
their immediate and active support—had his example in 
Delhi of reconverting to Hinduism the converted Muslims at 
their own free will, of turning masjids into Hindu temples 
and of other revolutionary activities of his, been copied in 
various towns and cities of India from Rajputana to Southern 
capitals—and had the Hindus risen openly against the 
Muslims and if the proclamation of the sxiccess of Hinduism 
were published openly, this Hindu Emperor would have perse­ 
cuted the Muslims as were the Hindus actually before them 
and would have also launched a special military offensive 
against the Muslims and would have made it impossible for 
them to live as Muslims ! 
791. But the Hindu Kings and Hindu people in general 
did not openly support this Hindu political revolution. They 
were, however, inwardly proud of it and overjoyed at it. 
They did appreciate this utter humiliation and ruination of 
the Muslim Sultanate at the hands of this Hindu Dharmarak­ 
shak 'Nasir-ud-din'. The Hindu kings and the Hindu society 
at large nevertheless refrained from attempting any open 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 313 
revolt. The one reason why the Hindu Society failed to 
attempt the establishment of a Hindu Empire at this most 
opportune moment, was that the Hindus harboured serious 
doubts whether this undreamt of revolution would succeed! 
If that revolution were to fail, they feared, the followers 
would never escape complete annihilation. So the Hindu 
community only waited. Secondly, the entire Hindu society 
never approved of the mass-conversion of Muslims to Hindu­ 
ism that was effected in and around Delhi as a sound 
religious practice ! The Hindu Dharma of the day meant 
ban on reconversion, not reconversion ! 'Religious tolerance 
had been their religion because of their perverted sense of 
values; their religion never brooked either the demolishing 
of Masjids or converting the Muslims to Hinduism. This sort 
of reactionary measure was considered by the Hindus as the 
greatest sin ! So, who could have predicted that jhe Hindu 
society itself would not oppose tooth and nail this religious 
revolution ? That possibility could not be ruled out alto­ 
gether ! Muslim opposition to this revolutionary change, 
however, in the imperial government and religion was quite 
natural. 
792. Under these circumstances Dharmarakshak (Nasir- 
ud-din) refrained from any further atrocities or revenge 
upon the Muslims in Delhi or elsewhere in the empire, consi­ 
dering that his religious and political revolution in Delni 
was in itself so daring as to put the Muslim power to shame 
and so he was satisfied that the Hindu society had now 
become strong enough to relish and digest such a revolution! 
And this was not a small achievement I The next step could 
be deferred be a later date ! The next favourable opportunity 
would most certainly to availed of. He did not, therefore, 
think it wise to stretch things too far so as to cause a 
complete break. 
793. On the other hand, as has already been told (in 
Paragraph 784) he allowed the Muslim soldiers and peasants 
and civilians equal rights to the new facilities and exemption 
from taxes which he did in the case of Hindus. Moreover, he 
314 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
kept on sending extremely valuable presents to those Muslim 
officers and Mulla-Moulavis whom he suspected to be secretly 
despising this religious revolution of the Hindus and the 
Hindu Empire, as often as he sent them to those Muslim 
Officers who were loyal to him, and with a extremely polite 
treatment kept them under his obligation. 
794. It is because of this exceptional skill of his at 
diplomacy that even after the successful realization of this 
religio-political revolution of Hindus, immediately or for 
months together thereafter, there was not a single Muslim 
revolt—no riots nor brawls—throughout the length and 
breadth of his vast empire. His whole administration was. 
working as smoothly as it did in the days of the old Muslim 
Sultans. Revenues, taxes or ransoms were collected from all 
provinces and remitted to the imperial treasury at Delhi 
without any default. In Delhi itself greatest of Muslim knights 
and feudatory Princes, Generals and Sardars and other court­ 
iers and officers attended the imperial court on the orders of 
this Hindu Dharmarakshak and took their appointed seats. 
Of the great Muslim noblemen reported by the historians of 
the time to be attending the court of this Hindu emperor,. 
Nasir-ud-din, some may be mentioned here : they were Ain- 
ul-Mulk Multani, Yusuf Safi, Hatim Khan, Kamaluddin Sufi, 
Earuk-didan-Tughlak, Mulgati, Mohammed Shah, Baharam 
Anayya, Yuklakhi, Hoshang, Kaphur Saheb*". Because of 
the presence of these big shots in the Hindu court of Nasir- 
ud-din and because of written letters promising allegiance to 
the emperor from governors, and administrators and Muslim 
officers in the army peace throughout the whole of India was 
never broken for months together. 
795. On the other hand, the Hindu kings from Rajput­ 
ana to Madurai did not protest, perhaps according to some 
previous secret pact, against the revolution effected by this- 
Hindu emperor. Why, availing themselves fully of this 
military coup in Delhi they began to rule the Hindu States 
independently as before. Their chief fault was that at this 
greatest and rarest of opportunities they did not make a. 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 316 
well-organized effort to proclaim the independence of the 
Hindus and establish a united strong central imperial power 
at Delhi. 
796. Under the circumstances the shrewd "Dharma­ 
rakshak" (Nasir-ud-din) well knew that although at first his 
Hindu administration was running smoothly, his revolutio­ 
nary Hindu empire depended on nO other thing than his 
armed might. He, therefore, kept the thousands of his 
choicest of Hindu soldiers stationed in the capital in all 
readiness! At every vital centre of defence in his empire he 
drafted his most faithful Hindu battalions and also the 
Muslim troops which had sworn loyalty towards him. For he 
knew perfectly well that although the Muslims everywhere in 
his empire obeyed him implicitly and swore allegiance to 
him, sooner or later some rebellious faction amongst them 
was bound to organize itself and stage a counter-revolution 
against his pro-Hindu authority ! 
797. Want of space obliges us to skip over many inter­ 
vening events. Suffice it to say that the imperial administra­ 
tion which nobody could have expected to work smoothly 
even for a day, ran most efficiently, not for a day, nor a 
month, but for nearly a year, overthrowing the Muslim 
domination and turning the very same Muslim 'Takhta' 
(throne) into a 'Sinhasan' of a Hindu emperor, and replacing 
the green Muslim Chand which had been flaunting almost 
over the whole of India by the victorious Hindu flag. 
Millions of Muslims, rich or poor, liege or serf, throughout 
the whole of India, accepted without a murmur the overlord- 
ship (Sovereignty) of the Hindu empire. For at least a year 
the great Muslim governors and officers obeyed implicitly 
the orders of this Hindu emperor and made the common 
Muslim community do like-wise. This itself was a great 
wonder which glorifies the Hindu history of the times. 
798. And another equally great wonder, which condemns 
the Hindus of the time, and those of later times also, is 
that in the histories written of the Hindu people and by the 
Hindu people no major reference, let alone grateful reference 
316 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
is made either to this Hindu imperial and religious revolu­ 
tion and to its architect and engineer Dharmarakshak, (Nasir- 
ud-din) ! Whatever few words are written about him are 
full of censure and ridicule for him and for his acts in strict 
pursuance of the Muslim historical writings ! 
GHYASUDDIN TUGHLAK 
799. But before this year of amazement elapsed one or 
two top-ranking Muslims ventured to hatch a conspiracy to 
overthrow the yoke of this Hindu emperor. Secret provocative 
pamphlets were being circulated and bigoted Moulavis were 
already instigating sedition secretly in their Masjids, that 
it was a grave insult to the whole Muslim-world that the 
Muslim imperial throne should be turned into a Hindu one 
and that the Muslims should be forced to bow down meekly 
before a 'Kafir', and finally that it was highly essential for 
the Muslims to go on a crusade against the Hindu sovere­ 
ignty in order to end the utter degradation of Islam. Bat 
no Muslim 'Amir', nor military chief nor any superior officer 
offered to lead the insurrection. Ultimately the administrator 
and governor of the Punjab under the Sultan of Delhi, by 
name Ghyasuddin, aspired to shoulder that responsibility. He 
began sending secret emissaries and epistles to that effect 
to various higher Muslim authorities under Sultan Nasir-ud- 
din. Ghyasuddin himself had sworn allegiance to the Sultan 
and was appointed military Governor of the Punjab while 
one of his sons was an officer at Delhi itself under the direct 
control of this Hinduised Sultan. Ghyasuddin called this 
son of his for a private visit under some pretext, and 
gathered every sort of minute detail about the situation in 
Delhi in his private interview with that son. Whereupon 
he came to know for certain that after the murder of 
AUauddin his sons and relatives were either killed or deprived 
of their eye-sight and thus rendered useless. When he was 
thus satisfied that there was no proper heir of Allauddin's 
for the Sultanate at Delhi, he was all the more elated to 
declare boldly, that as there was no proper heir left from the 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 317 
house of Allauddin's, it was only some powerful Muslim who 
could lay claim to the throne at Delhi. That Kafir Hindu 
Paria was not to be sufiFered to touch it even. That Kafir had 
married all the widows of all the earlier Sultans and the young 
Muslim girls and maidens from the royal palace to the Parias 
(Sweepers) whom he had formerly raised to eminence and 
converted all those ladies of the Muslim royal families to 
Hinduism. As no Muslim dared to dethrone such a sinful 
Hindu Kafir, he himself was going to shoulder the 
responsibility*!. 
800. For the first time these secret letters of his were 
turned down with spite by the top Muslim oificers, while 
some others placed them into the hands of Dharmarakshak 
Nasir-ud-din himself, who having already apprehended such 
an eventuality and undaunted by it clamly prepared himself 
to crush this rising of Ghyasuddin immediately. Good many 
Muslim generals who had acnkowledged him as a Sultan, 
enlisted their forces in his service while the Hindu section 
of that imperial army was always ready to fight at the cost 
of their lives under his standard. 
801. At last depending chiefly on the Muslim battalions 
which were employed under his command for the protection 
of the Punjab and the frontiers, Ghyasuddin decided to 
march upon Delhi. Some Hindu soldiers, too, were, amongst 
those advancing Muslim forces. No sooner did he hear that 
Ghyasuddin was marching towards Delhi than the Hindu 
emperor—Dharmarakshak Nasir-ud-din himself—attacked 
him with his whole imperial army**. Along with this Hindu 
Emperor marched the great Muslim Generals, too, with their 
battalions to fight under his command. When the two armies 
met, on the first day the imperial army of Sultan Nasir-ud- 
din won the field, and Ghyasuddin had to retreat. But the 
latter did not lose heart. Knowing that depression of heart 
at this time meant utter ruin, and that success depended 
chiefly on enterprise and intrepidity Ghyasuddin rearranged 
his ranks and made ready for another battle. Fortunately for 
Ghyasuddin, on that very day one or two Muslim chieftains 
318 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
in the Sultan's armies conspired to betray the Hindu Emperor 
Nasir-ud-din and let the former know of their decision most 
secretly. Encouraged by this, Ghyasuddin himself fell upon 
the forces of Sultan Nasir-ud-din (Hindu Samrat, Shree 
Dharmarakshak). In the melee that ensued, the betrayal 
by the Muslim forces brought about the utter defeat of Sultan 
Nasir-ud-din**, So the Sultan—Shree Dharmarakshak—left 
t h e field a n d s t a r t e d f o r D e l h i . B u t m a d w i t h v i c t o r y 
Ghyasuddin marched straight towards Delhi, and in that 
hot pursuit Shree Dharmarakshak—Sultan Nasir-ud-din—fell 
helpless in the hands of the enemy**. 
802. When the victor, Ghyasuddin, ordered the captive 
Sultan, Nasir-ud-din, to be brought before him, and charg­ 
ing him with the murder of Mubarik decided to sentence him 
to death J he asked the captive the last question: "Setting 
aside the question of political expediency or the bid for the 
throne of the Sultan and considering only the personal 
aspect of this act of yours, what personal wrong did Mubarik 
do to you, that you might seek to avenge it by his death?" 
To this the captive Nasir-ud-din (Khushrukhan) replied to 
this effect :" Of course ! He was guilty of a such personal 
wrong to me ! For the most heinous crime of inflicting 
homosexual and other unbearable atrocities that this mean 
and vicious Mubarik had perpetrated on my body ever 
since my tender age and for the humiliation that he had 
heaped upon my life. I had long rowed most solemnly 
that at the earliest opportunity I would avenge all those 
personal wrongs upon that villain with murder*^ ! 
803. Thereupon Ghyasuddin dispatched him instanta­ 
neously. 
804. That was the tragic end of Shree Dharmarakshak 
(Nasir-ud-din). But the last of the accredited Hindu 
Emperor of Delhi, the valiant Prithviraj Chouhan, was also 
equally tragically murdered by the Muslims after his utter 
rout in the last battle I 
805. And the dauntless Shree Guru Banda of the 
Panjab ! After inflicting several crushing defeats upon the 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 319 
Muslims, when at last he fell into the hands of the Muslim 
monarch,was he not locked up in a cage like a wild beast ? 
Didn't red-hot iron pikes and pincers pierce his body and pull 
out large pieces of his flesh and was he not after so much 
torture put to cruel death by the Muslims ? 
806. But is any thorough-bred Hindu likely to forget 
the gratitude that we all owe to those various Hindu gallant 
warriors for their glorious martyrdom in the cause of Hindu­ 
ism, simply because they were defeated in the end ? It is 
this grateful memory of such martyrs that becomes the 
perennial source of inspiration for the nation forages after 
ages ! 807. O You ! Hindu Samrat 'Shree Dharmarakshak ! 
This martyrdom of yours, too, has become a fresh-water 
spring of inspiration for the Hindu nation! It is to atone 
for the sin of failing to utter a single grateful word for you, 
to preserve some souvenir, some memento of yours, that 
the Hindus of your own times or those of the later generations 
have committed, and it is again in expiation of the sin of our 
Hindu ingratitude towards you that we have most reverently 
offered you this separate chapter in this book. 
808. Had you but chosen to remain a Muslim Sultan, 
you could easily have perpetuated the Sultanate of the whole 
of India down to your descendants, generations after 
generations, as it happened in the case of the Khiljee or 
Slave dynasties after AUauddin or Ghyasuddin. But with 
glowing respect and pride for the Hindu religion and the 
Hindu nation, you purified the very Muslim Title of Sultan, 
turned the Muslim 'Takhta' into a Hindu 'Sinhasan', and 
slighting the Muslim Sultanate proclaimed yourself a Hindu 
Samrat (Emperor) ! 
809. After Emperor Prithviraj Chauhan, it was you 
alone who made a gallant bid to occupy the imperial throne 
of Delhi as a Hindu Emperor ! In spite of your birth in an 
humble and miserable Hindu family; in spite of your being 
defiled and converted to Islam and made an abject slave by 
your Muslim enemies at your tender age, you became the 320 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Sultan of Sultans by the dint of your valour, your versatility, 
your military exploits, your arch-diplomacy and your 
adroitness in engineering deep-laid plots, and made the 
whole of India resound with the glory of Hinduism ! We 
have done our duty to relate with proofs your (in a way) 
peculiar life to the Hindu Nation and the world at large so 
far as it is possible for us do so. 
THE PECULIAR CHARACTER OF THIS HINDU 
REVOLUTION ! 
810. Although in this millenial Hindu-Muslim war the 
Hindu Nation had been fighting on the political and military 
fronts more or less on equal grounds, using effective counter- 
ofiensives and tactics and ultimately over-powering the 
Muslim sovereigny, it was incessantly overwhelmed on the 
religious front, because of their own hateful bans on re­ 
conversion and the like—fetters, which prevented the Hindus 
from opening any counter-offensive on the Muslim religion 
as such ! But, this Hindu Emperor, Shree Dharmarakshak 
(Nasir-ud-din) successfully launched a counter-attack upon 
the Muslims, both on political and military as well as on the 
religious front, using the same means and weapons. To 
counter-balance the forceful conversion of the Hindus by the 
Muslims, Shree Dharmarakshak (Nasir-ud-din) brought 
about hundreds of Muslim reconversions to Hinduism and 
their repurification ceremonies under the protection of his 
armed might. Just as the Muslims used to rush headlong 
to ravage and convert the Hindu women to Islam, in the 
same way the Hindus broke into the harems of the Muslim 
Sultan and converted the willing Mohamedan women to 
Hinduism and married them to their Hindu followers. If 
the Muslims demolished the Hindu temples, Shree Dharma­ 
rakshak, in the excitement of this victory, turned the very 
Muslim Masjids into Hindu temples. It was this Dharmara­ 
kshak (Nasir-ud-din) who for the first time in Hindu history 
showed so very successfully and on such a large scale how 
the Muslim armed aggression upon Hinduism and the 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 321 
religious persecution that they perpetrated before and after 
could be retaliated and how the Muslims could be routed; 
completely on the religious front too. If from the beginning; 
the Muslims had to face such bold opposition and been 
forced to suffer such powerful counter-strokes on the religious 
front, they would never have dared to strike, in spite of 
all their military might, at Hinduism. This first blow which 
the Hindus delivered to Islam in Delhi shook the Muslims 
so very severely ! And this is the peculiar character of 
this Hinduistic revolution brought about by Shree Dharma­ 
rakshak (Khushrukhan Nasir-ud-din)**. 
811. We have intentionally called this account of 
Khushrukhan's life and achievements as based on proofs ! 
Although, as we have pointed out in Paragraph 744, nobody 
barring some honourable exceptions, has written any good 
word about you, 0 Khushrukhan, the very inconsistent and 
confused and oblique references to you, tell a story which is 
all the more glorious for you ! As such although your life 
and career as painted by us has so far not any 'written' or: 
'oral' 'basis' or any strong proofs, even then there is another 
equally strong and unimpeachable legal evidence which, at 
times, sets aside even written or oral ones, in such historical 
and judicial matters of daily occurrence. That evidence is. 
called circumstantial evidence ! 
THE AUTHORITY OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE 
812. In the science of Logic the authority of circumstan­ 
tial evidence is considered, at least in certain cases, to be 
the better mode of reasoning than inference, the word of the 
elders, or illustration. Especially when the intentions and 
feelings or emotions of the engineers of deep-laid political 
conspiracies and plots are to be ascertained circumstantial 
evidence is considered to be the only, strong basis for it and 
it should be thought so, and rightly too ! The written 
confessions of the accused under their own signatures can be 
refuted by the circumstantial evidence of bodily persecution 
and torture; so does written evidence ! 
S22 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
813. Your life, 0 Dharmarakshak, therefore, has been 
based more on the strictly logical circumstantial evidence 
than on your own words or the writings of your contemporary 
and later day historians; hence it is based on solid proof. 
Even if your words are not available, your very acts, and 
deeds are in themselves far more telling. 
814. The brother of this Shree Dharmarakshak, 
Nasir-ud-din, was himself a very great warrior and an able 
administrator. The original Hindu name of this brother of 
Shree Dharmarakshak is also not known as yet, for in his 
very early childhood he too was converted and made a slave. 
When this Hindu Emperor appointed him as the Governor of 
Gujrath, he openly accepted Hinduism and canvassed for it. 
In order to overthrow the Muslim government in Gujrath he 
raised a Hindu revolt and sent twenty to twentyfive thousand 
brave warriors of his parwar (community) to help his brother 
at Delhi. What ultimately became of them all is not known 
to history. He too deserves a place of honour in Hindu 
history. 
815. And on the same basis of this circumstantial 
evidence does that former Hindu royal princess and the 
Yadav Queen, Devaldevi, who was equally responsible for 
bringing about the unprecedented Hindu revolution of Shree 
Dharmarakshak Nasir-ud-din, and who was his important 
accomplice in the secret plot, and who became, after the 
successful accomplishment of the said revolution, the Hindu 
Empress of Shree Dharmarakshak, deserves even a greater 
place of honour, like that of Devi Padmini of Chitod for 
the unimaginable wrongs and persecution, humiliation and 
the consequent mental agonies that she had to suffer in the 
most adverse circumstances .' She deserves the honour of a 
brave warrior Rajput Princess burning herself on the pyre or 
in Johar ! 
816. Her end, too, is clouded in mystery ! One of the 
writers of the time has said that she was provided*' for by 
Ghyasuddin after he became the Sultan of Delhi. 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 323 
NOT A FRUITLESS MARTYRDOM ! 
817. Thus were the two valiant associates of the Hindu JEmperor, Dharmarakshak (Nasir-ud-din) forced to court martyrdom ! But their martyrdom lent a wonderful strength to the morale of the Hindu Nation. For, the fact that in Delhi itself was established a Hindu Empire which could powerfully and effectively govern the Muslim States, Nawabs, and Muslim populace throughout India for nearly a year, helped the Hindu kings and the Hindu people to shake off the dominant influence of the Muslim political superiority, which had for centuries overawed the Hindu mind. The myth of this Muslim political superiority was at once exploded and a rare confidence was inspiied amongst the Hindus that, were they but to run a little risk, they would also be able to crush the Muslim political hold on them. Shree Dharmarakshak courted martyrdom in 1321; it was soon followed by the risings in Hindu States in the north and south of India. The Muslim provinces round about Delhi, too, began fighting with the Muslim imperial power at Delhi in order to establish their own dynasties in their own provinces. In the end hardly within fifteen to sixteen years of the martyrdom of Shree Dharmarakshak, the Muslim imperial authority at Delhi became extremely weak, and a powerful Hindu revolt culminated in the establishment of a completely independent Hindu Kingdom of Vijaynagar, the detailed account of which must necessarily be deferred to next chapter. 
• 
CHAPTER XVin 
THE BEGINNmG OF THE FINAL OVERTHROW OF THE MUSLIM EMPIRE 
818. Soon after slaying Shree Dharmarakshak (Nasir- ud-din) Ghyasuddin Tughlak ascended the throne of the Delhi Sultanate in A.D. 1321 and issued a proclamation to that effect^. This was the end of the Khilji dynasty and the beginning of the Tughlak rule. 
819. Ghyasuddin too was old. Naturally he treated the Muslims leniently. B u t although born of a H i n d u jat mother, he, strangely enough did not fall short of any type of religious persecution of the Hindus perpetrated by any or all of the former Muslim Sultans* ! 
820. Ghyasuddin died in A.D. 1326 and was succeeded by his son Mohammad Tughlak who has gone down in history as 'crazy'. He once had a strange whim of shifting his capital from Delhi to Devgiri in the south. Immediately he changed the name of Devgiri, according to the Muslim tradition, into Doulatabad, just as Warangal had been chang­ ed earlier by the Muslims into Sultanpur*. But this change of capital from Delhi to Devgiri caused him and his subjects so much trouble*, disrupted his already confusion-fraught revenue system so completely and so many insurrections and political risings^ were brewing in the royal families and the people at large in the Deccan (as already pointed out in the previous chapter) that this 'crazy' Mohammad was ultimately forced to have another whim of shifting the capital once again back to Delhi. But this short interlude cost millions (crores) of rupees and thousands of lives. 
820-A. With a view to get out of this financial trouble he introduced the copper coins, which drained his treasury completely; but he blamed the farmers and the other gentry 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 325 
for it saying that they did not pay the taxes. He therefore, 
issued orders to his fighting forces to collect the revenue 
under compulsion, but while the Muslims were shown all 
leniency in the collection of taxes the Hindus were most 
cruelly forced to pay them. Just as the beasts are surrounded 
•on all sides in a hunting expedition and are held at bay and 
then massacred, similarly a number of Hindu towns and 
villages were besieged and the Hindu population therein was 
mercilessly put to the sword. (This sort of persecution 
devastated numerous Hindu towns and villages while whole 
provinces like Kanouj were rendered desolate' !) 
821. Nevertheless there darted from the bow of the 
Hindu nation a Ram-ban [an arrow of Ram—an (unerring) 
unmistakable shot !] which put a stop, even if temporarily, 
to the Ravan-like atrocities by the Muslims perpetrated 
under every Sultan over the Hindus for centuries together i 
822. The diabolic Muslim ambition to spread the 
unitary Muslim empire to the ends of Hindustan (Paragraphs 
636-737) received a death-blow in the very hour of its fruition. 
For (as it is shown in the previous chapter) with the first 
vigorous blow struck by the Hindu Emperor, Shree Dharma­ 
rakshak, the extensive Muslim Empire had already begun to 
•dwiadle, while the Hindu discontent, especially in the Deccan 
culminated into a powerful insurrection which shattered the 
already dwindling Muslim empire into small fragments. 
NEW HINDU STATE 
823. For in A.D. 1336 was established the new, inde­ 
pendent, and powerful Hindu State of Vijaynagar, defying 
the Muslim might in the very life-time in this 'crazy' 
Mohammad Tughlak, a detailed account of which will be 
given in the next chapter. 
824. Immediately after this momentous event the 
Deccanese Muslims under Hasan Bahamani rose in rebellion 
against the Delhi Sultanate following the age-old separatist 
tendency of the Muslims which had been exhibited in their 
fratricidal wars ever since the times of Mohammad Paigam- 
326 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
bar. Hasan Bahamani was crowned with success in this 
attempt and so he founded the Bahamani kingdom in A.D. 
1347 and proclaimed himself to be an independent Sultan. 
825. This act of Hasan Bahamani will explode the 
popular misconception of the millions of credulous gulls 
amongst the Hindus that the Muslims always showed a 
united front in their political as well as religious wars, that 
they never fought amongst themselves and that they had 
no separatist tendencies—a baseless misconception which is 
not only foolish in the extreme but which falsely extols the 
foreigners and undeservedly, runs down our own Hindu 
community. A number of such instances have already been 
cited in this volume and many more will occur in the pages 
that follow. The history of the Muslim community all the 
world over is replete with such instances. 
A GRIEVOUS FALL AND BREAKING OF 
THE DREAM OF AN UNBROKEN MUSLIM EMPIRE 
826. Just as perhaps some adventurous mountaineer 
should, in the excitement of his almost impracticable 
ambition to scale the highest peak of the H i m a l a y a s and to 
hoist his national flag there before anybody else does it^ 
climb on and on, and after reaching some altogether different 
peak should victoriously cry out, "This is the very same 
highest peak" ! When all at once the seemingly highest peak 
should give way under the heavy load of his ambition, being 
made as it really is, not of any solid rock, but of a frozen 
heap of snowflakes, and the ambitious climber should topple 
down and fall headlong from crag to crag into the deep ravine 
of destruction along with the bits and fragments of his 
signal victory—in the very same way the Muslim ambition 
to establish the centralized paramount Muslim power over 
• the whole of India was beguiled for a while and ultimately 
came to naught. All the Asian Muslim States right from 
the Arabs to the Mongols invaded India one after another 
and carried on for seven or eight centuries continuously 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 327 
the bitterest, bloodiest and cruellest wars and at last when 
in the regime of AUauddin practically the whole of India 
passed under the Muslim sway round about the year A.D. 
1310, the Muslim ambition seemed to be almost fulfilled 1 
But as it is already told, with a hard knock from the 
resurgent Hindu valour the Muslim rule collapsed from the 
highest peak of success attained by Sultan AUauddin and 
was shattered to pieces within only seven or eight years, 
never to rise to that giddy heights again ! The Hindu 
might went on increasing like the crescent moon ! 
DEATH OF CRAZY' MOHAMMAD AND AFTER 
827. This'crazy'Sultan Mohammad died in A.D. 1351 
and his tottering crown with the disintegrating ,Sultanate 
of Delhi passed on to his cousin 'Pherozshah Tughlak'. 
This Pherozshah's mother was the daughter of the Rajput 
K i n g Malbhatti of Deepalpur'. W h e n Pherozshah's father 
demanded her (that Rajput Princess) in marriage. King 
Malbhatti flatly refused so to give her up*, whereupon 
Pherozshah's father marched on Malbhatti and began to 
persecute the H i n d u s most cruelly. The princess could not 
bear the inhuman sufferings of her father and her Hindu 
brethren in the kingdom. So she volunteered to marry 
Pherozshah's father^. However praiseworthy the tenderness 
of her heart might be it has permanently stained her father's 
family. Had she swallowed fire like some Padmini of 
Chitod and followed the path of martyrdom for the sake of 
religion, her life and her family tradition would both have 
been for ever glorified ! 
THE SUPERSTITIOUS MUSLIMS ! 
828. An anecdote of this time of the Tughlaks, which 
is recorded in history, may be related here so that the 
reader might have some idea of the extent to which the 
superstitious nature of the Muslims could go and of the 
influence which the religious credulity and fanaticism of the 
Arabs invariably had over the Muslims of later days ever 
328 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
since the inception of Muslim religion. 
828-A. In order to atone for the crazy religious acts 
and the harassment of the subjects by the 'mad' Mohammad 
(setting aside the religious persecution of Hindus which was 
deemed harmonious with the tenets of the Muslim religion) 
Sultan Pherozshah interned" with the bones of the late 'mad' 
Mohammad the original papers regarding the reimbursement 
of the unjust land revenue collected by him, refund of fines 
and compensation for the other unjust acts of his, or their 
governmental acknowledgements along with other original 
papers signed by Mohammad himself. This action of 
Pherozshah was perhaps prompted by his credulous belief, 
that on the strength of this written record of the compen­ 
sation for all his crimes the great Allah would forgive 
Mohammad on the last day of the judgment I And, be it 
remembered that Pherozshah was well-educated according 
to the standards of the time ! What to say, then, of the 
common people ! 
829. Although in the beginning Pherozshah proclaimed 
himself as the Sultan of Hindustan, everywhere in India, 
with the only exception of Delhi and a small region around 
it, the Hindus and the Muslims began one after another 
to repudiate his imperial authority. In the South the 
celebrated kingdom of Vijaynagar had openly asserted its 
freedom. Under these circumstances Pherozshah Tughlak 
d e c i d e d finally t o a c k n o w l e d g e t h e i n d e p e n d e n c e o f t h e 
recalcitrant peoples under him in order to assuage their 
political bitterness and to consolidate whatever little he 
could retain rather than lose all. He, therefore, gave an 
ofiBcial recognition to the independence of the Bahamani 
kingdom in the south and to that of the valiant Hindu 
kingdom of Vijaynagar" which was founded by the great 
Hindu leaders who were fired with the bitterest hatred for 
the Muslim domination and were bent on driving it away 
right out of India. 
830. Thus was the Muslim imperial power, which had 
reached its zenith round about the years A.D. 1310-12 in 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 329 
Allauddin's times as a result of the incessant Hindu-Muslim 
wars for about six or seven centuries, and which had spread 
over almost the whole of India, dissolved by the very 
descendant of the same illustrious Sultan, for he could not 
help yielding to the powerful Hindu resistance. The Muslim 
empire over the whole of India was completely shattered in 
the hour of its fruition, never to be rebuilt on such a vast 
scale. Now the Hindu resurgent independent power had 
begun its inroads on the Muslim might which were never to 
cease again 1 
831. In fact, the moment Pherozshah Tughlak recog­ 
nized the political independence of the South the Muslim 
imperial power came to an end ! He, as it were, rang the 
death-knell of the Muslim ambition of an imperial power ! 
THE DIRECT EVIDENCE 
832. This explicit recognition of the political indepen­ 
dence of the Deccan, including that of the newly established 
Hindu state of Vijaynagar by the Sultan of Delhi, Pherozshah 
Tughlak himself, conclusively proves the statement which 
we have made in paragraphs 807 to 817 and which has so far 
escaped the notice of the writers of Hindu history. It is the 
two-fold politico-religious aggression of the Hindu Emperor, 
•Shree Dharmarakshak, (Nasir-ud-din) in Delhi itself on the 
Muslim power and especially his frightful revenge of the 
religious persecution of the Hindus over the Muslims in much 
the same horrid way, and the terror it struck in the minds 
of the Muslims, which inspired this political rising of 
Vijaynagar which in its turn dashed to pieces the Muslim 
ambition of an all-India empire ! 
833. Although Sultan Pherozshah helplessly surrendered 
his overlordship over the Deccan, he still mercilessly contin­ 
ued to persecute the Hindus in the big cities like Delhi under 
his direct control^*. The Hindus, too, persisted in their 
staunch resistance in the defence of their religion even at the 
risk of martyrdom. Numerous instances of the varied kinds 
•of this Hindu reaction to the Muslim atrocities are recorded. 330 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
one of which might be given here on the authority of the 
Muslim writers themselves. 
833-A. Sultan Pherozshah hated the Brahmins far more 
bitterly than the other Hindus. He said, "Brahmins are the 
veritable keys to the strong fortress of the Hindu religion^*." 
It is the Brahmins who organised a resistance movement 
against the Jizia tax, freshly imposed on the Hindus by Sultan 
Pherozshah. They organized collective hunger-strike before 
the royal palace and announced their determination to 
swallow fire and court martyrdom. But the Sultan heeded 
it not. So, many Brahmins, no longer able to bear the humi­ 
liation, died in that horrible manner. In the end the Hindus 
of other castes paid up the tax for such staunch defenders 
of their religion that still survived and saved their lives" ! . 
834. But the account of one of those Brahmins is the 
most remarkable for its martyrdom. In the city of Delhi 
itself this old Brahmin openly^worshipped an idol^^. Now 
diabolic religion of Sultan Pherozshah Tughlak had abso­ 
lutely banned any such idol-worship throughout his kingdom. 
But in order to protest against this ban that Brahmin 
collected all the Hindus in the courtyard of his house and 
worshipped the idol with such great pomp, that many 
Muslim men, women and children, too, became the devotees 
of that idol. The rumour quickly spread far and wide that 
this Brahmin's God always came to the rescue of his devotee.. 
The news that this Brahmin openly worshipped idols painted 
on a wooden plank reached the ears of the Sultan wha 
immediately had him brought as a captive, along with his. 
idol, before him. Thereupon he called all the Ulemas (the 
Muslim religious priests) and asked them "What punishment 
should be inflicted on this Brahmin ?" They replied "This 
Brahmin should either be a Muslim or be burnt alive to 
death." The Brahmin thereupon chose to die that horrible 
death by burning. In Delhi just before the king's court a 
big pile of wood was made and the Brahmin was placed on 
it, bound hand and foot, with the idol painted on the wooden 
plank. The Muslim demons set fire to that pile of wood' 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 331 
from all sides. Still the Brahmin would not consent to be 
converted to Islam. In a few cruel moments the fire blazed 
very hot on all sides. But without even a faint sigh of pain 
or grief the Brahmin remained bowing down to the idol. 
Within a moment the hungry flames swallowed up the devoted 
Brahmin" ! 
835. This arch-enemy of the Hindus, Sultan Pherozshah 
Tughlak, died in A.D. 1388, followed by an utter chaos in 
the meagre remains of his kingdom, whereas on one occasion 
two of his grandsons fell out and at the two ends of the city 
of Delhi there ruled two Sultans at one and the same time, 
Mohammadshah and Nasratshah, the two grandsons of Pheroz. 
Half the city of Delhi became the capital of the one, while 
the other half that of the other" !! 
INVASION BY TAIMURLANG 
836. Under these chaotic conditions Delhi fell a prey 
to the inhuman ravages of the notorious Taimurlang, the 
Sultan of the far off Samarkand. 
837. Taimur was a Turk", and not originally a Muslim. 
After conquering the city of Baghdad he burned to ashes the 
whole library of Muslim literature and at many places he 
even burned Masjids" ! In A.D. 1369 he became the King 
of Samarkand. Following the lead of Chengeezkhan before 
him he had conquered not less then twenty-seven crowns 
from Russia in the West to Afghanistan in the South-East*" I 
Because he had lost a leg in one of the battles he received the 
nickname 'lang' (lame). Thereafter he happened to cast his 
eyes on India, not simply because of any allurement of 
political power or the lust for victory but because he had 
formed a bitter hatred towards India. For, he had in the 
meantime become a Muslim*^. His original destructive 
tendencies now received this new ghastly impetus ! Says he 
in his autobiography. "My intention in marching upon 
India is to massacre the Kafir Hindus there, destroy the idols 
of their Gods, convert them all to Islam and thus win the title 
of a 'Gazi' in the court of the Allah**". 
332 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
838. So immediately in A.D. 1397 he invaded India. 
He had under him a gigantic force of ninety thousand strong. 
He marched straight upto Punjab. Still nobody came 
forward to oppose him. He therefore swooped down straight 
on Delhi, where a small force came to oppose him. in the 
name of the Sultan of Delhi but it was soon put to rout. An 
interesting point to note is that this veteran army of Taimur­ 
lang which had trampled over half the world was scared to 
death for a time by the mere sight of elephants in this 
ludicrous army of the Sultan of Delhi**, for they had seen 
such huge beasts for the first time in their lives. Yet it got 
over the fear very soon and as soon as the Sultan's forces 
were completely routed it dashed violently into the city 
of Delhi, letting loose the orgy of wholesale massacre, plunder 
and arson**. Millions of lives were lost this day. After 
having thus quenched his thirst for Hindu blood to some 
extent, Taimur turned further to Meerut and Haridwar, 
smashing to pieces Hindu idols at many places on his way*^. 
At Haridwar he reached the pinnacle of his cruelty in the 
Hindu blood-bath. How many instances is one to quote of 
the harrowing atrocities which the Hindu community had to 
suffer 'simply because of their dire determination and holy 
resolve not to forsake their religion ! Prom Haridwar this 
fiendlike Taimur went on further to the north, raining Hindu 
blood on the Shivalik hills, Nagarcote, Jammu and demoli­ 
shing Hindu temples on the way. On his way he got the news 
of his native capital of Samarkand being threatened by the 
rebels. So, mad with fury and mental anguish, he hurried 
straight off to Samarkand with the whole of his army**. 
839. In this Taimurlangian deluge was washed off the 
little that was left of the Tughlak Sultanate. In the chaotic 
conditions that then prevailed in north India the Sayyads 
usurped the nominal Sultanate of the Tughlaks*'. 
840. Availing themselves of this miserable condition of 
the Muslim power at Delhi, the veteran defenders of the 
Hindu religion, the independent Rajput kings, went on 
setting free the territories formerly conquered by the Muslims. 
OTH GLORIOUS EPOCH 333: 
Eor that matter, the holy places of the Hindus like Kashi, 
Prayag and others had, even before this time, been recon­ 
quered from the Muslims**. But !—Although the Muslim 
political power there was defeated and uprooted their colonies 
and there religious centres like their Masjids and mosques 
were not destroyed—as did the Muslims, whenever they 
conquered the Hindu territories, slaughtering the Hindus 
irrespective of their age or sex and pulling down the Hindu 
holy places of worship, so as to make mere existence impos­ 
sible for them. But because the Hindus did not emulate the 
Muslims in this respect, these local Muslims who were left, 
alive and unmolested turned traitors, like serpents fed and 
fostered as pets, and invited again and again the Muslim 
aggressors for help and made life miserable for the Hindus 
in those holy places and cities. But the Rajput malady of 
the suicidal generosity even now persisted without any 
moderation. (The reader is referred to the detailed discussion 
in this regard in paragraphs 421 to 426) 
RANA KUMBHA 
841. Most notable among the Rajput heroes of the time 
was Rana Kumbha, who excelled not only the great leaders 
of Chitod but even those of Hindustan in respect of valour 
and success. He went to war with a powerful neighbouring 
Muslim Sultan, Mohammad Khilji of Malwa who had become 
independent by renouncing the overlordship (paramountcy) 
of the Sultan of Delhi, and in a battle near Sultanpur van­ 
quished the latter completely. Sultan Mohammad Khilji of 
Malwa was at last caught alive by Rana Kumbha*^. But 
grossly affected as he was by the age-old malady of the per­ 
verted sense of virtues, as the other Hindu heroes before him 
were, he allowed the Sultan to go free,*" considering it a 
noble act on his own part. Had but Rana Kumbha been 
taken captive by the Muslim Sultan, Mohammad Khilji ? 
He would very likely have been deprived of his eye sight, as 
Prithviraj was, and brutally murdered according to the 
diabolic war-ethics of the Muslims. In fact, this diabolic 
334 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
war-ethics is the only one which is beneficial to a nation in- 
such fiendish wars*! and hence is highly pious and thoroughly, 
sound ! 
842. This battle was considered so unique and unparal- 
alled in the Hindu history of those days that in order to 
celebrate it Rana Kumbha erected a colossal and artistic 
pillar of victory at Chitod,** which still stands to the admira­ 
tion of all visitors ! In a like manner did Rana Kumbha 
beat down Sultan Kutbuddin of Gujrath** when the latter 
attacked Kumbhalgad, and Kutbuddin had ultimately to sue 
for peace and save his life**. 
843. Even after Rana Kumbha, Rajputana claims so 
many brave and capable leaders of men that whole volumes 
ought really to be devoted to the generations that produced 
each of them. But our recent histories are so much haunted 
by those of the Muslim and European nations that they fight 
shy of recording the glorious acts of the Hindus—it is in fact 
a clear proof of the absence of any independent research 
made by them and of their glaring ignorance ! Fortunately 
the contemporary Rasos, written honestly and with a rare 
literary flavour, and inspired by the exceptional valour of 
the Hindus of the times are available here and there. 
Prithviraj Raso, Hameer Raso, Chhatrasal Raso and many 
others—beautiful heroic ballads and narrative poems of 
varied lengths—are to be had even today. But God knows if 
these historians know them even by name ! Again modern 
historical research has discovered many rock inscriptions 
not only in Rajputana, but in the caves at various other 
places. They also are likely to help a lot in re-writing the 
history of these Hindu heroes. But the present doesn't seem 
to be the proper time to undertake that work on a major 
institutional basis ! Till such a propitious time comes, smal­ 
ler institutions or individual scholars can start, if not the 
actual research work, at least the work of collection of this 
vast deal of source material. Such a fond hope can safely 
be entertained if we remember the celebrated name of Raj- 
wade alone! 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 335 
LODI DYANSTY 
844. After the end of the Sayyad Dynasty in A.D. 1450 
some Lodis of Afghan extraction ruled as Sultans at Delhi 
for some time. Of them all Shikandar Lodi tried to consoli­ 
date his power during A.D. 1488 to 1517. This Shikandar 
Lodi again was born of a Hindu mother,'^ but like every 
other Muslim ruler he always had a stern eye upon the 
Hindus**. He again enforced the ban on the Hindu pilgri­ 
mages, which the Hindus had begun to make in the 
meanwhile. He even forbade collective baths in holy rivers 
on Parvani days. Nevertheless as elsewhere the Hindus 
resisted stubbornly even at the cost of their lives. The 
following account of a great martyr should suffice to illust­ 
rate the foregoing remarks. 
845. At a certain town near Lakhnau (Lucknow) lived 
a Brahmin named Buddha, who preached that whatever the 
just and virtuous religious code one followed, so long as one 
followed it sincerely, it was equally acceptable to God. In 
spite of all the harassment caused to him by the Muslims on 
this account, he propagated his views so very vigorously that 
even the Kazi of Lakhnau had to give way. In the end the 
authorities committed this complaint to the Sultan. Shikan- 
darkhan, thereupon, had a full-dress debate between this 
Brahmin and nine other learned Moulavis. But the Brahmin, 
loyal as he was to his own religion and to truth, would not 
give in. So the Sultan himself threatened him: "Be a Muslim 
or you will be put to instant death". And as the said 
Brahmin spurned his threat he was killed forthwith*'. 
RANA-SANG 
846. After the death of Shikandar Lodi in A.D. 1517 
his son Ibrahim Lodi ascended the tottering throne of the 
Sultan of Delhi. Por the disintegrating Muslim power at 
Delhi experienced excruciating death pangs at the hands of 
the Rajputs of the time, who had in Eana Sang a very great 
valiant leader. Even the smaller Muslim rulers took great 
offence at the brave deeds of Rana Sang. The ruler of Idar 
336 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
expressed his malice against Rana Sang by naming a dog at 
his door Sangrana**. In order to chastise this monkeying of 
the Muslims Rana Sang marched with a large army against 
Idar and vanquishing them completely at every place he 
avenged in full the wrongs done to the Hindus'*. This battle 
caused no harm to the Hindus round about. On the contrary 
they looked upon him with evident pride and pleasure as 
their God-sent saviour and protector. Registering his con­ 
quests over the Muslim foes at every place with triumphal 
marches amidst popular applause, the loud beats of his war- 
drums and the gay fluttering of his victorious flag he returned 
to Chitod in A.D. 1519*". He had by this time liberated 
Ratanbhor, Gagrone, Walpi (Kalpi ?), Bhilsa and Chanderi 
from the Muslim domination and annexed them to his own 
kingdom. 
DEFEAT OF SULTAN IBRAHIM LODI BY RANA SANG IN THE BATTLE OF KRANOLI 
846-A. In order to improve the decaying condition of 
the Muslim power, constantly harmed by the Rajputs, Sultan 
Ibrahim Lodi gathered all his strength and invaded Rana 
Sang. The two parties joined battle at Khanoli where in a 
bloody action Rana Sang put to rout the Sultan's army and 
sent him back to Delhi downcast and crestfallen". 
BABAR'S INVASION 
847. Beset with such calamities Subedar Daulatkhan 
Lodi of Lahore became, along with other Muslim chieftains, 
quite pessimistic about his own safe existence. As the last 
resort, they invited Babar,** the then powerful ruler of Afgha­ 
nistan, to help them put down Rana Sang. Babar, too, had 
been waiting for such an opportunity, for as a descendant of 
Taimurlang he claimed a direct right to the sovereignty of 
India**. So Babar hastened to help Daulatkhan Lodi in 
A . D . 1526. 
848. Seeing this allied Muslim army come menacingly 
the scared Sultan Ibrahim Lodi sought the help of the valiant 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 337 
Hindu King of Chitod, Rana Sang, in spite of the fact that 
the latter had very recently inflicted a crushing defeat on 
him. But the Muslims were never ashamed of eating an 
humble pie before the Hindus on such occasions. Again it 
has been already shown and will hereafter be shown how 
foolish and baseless are our popular notions that the Muslims 
never fought amongst themselves, or that they never sought 
help from the Hindus to fight with their fellow Muslims, 
should such an eventuality arise ! Sultan Ibrahim's is a 
glaring instance in point. With the help of Rana Sang 
Sultan Ibrahim fought w i t h the invading B a b a r at Panipat 
in A.D. 1626. But as Ibrahim himself was killed on the 
battle-field and his army took to flight Rana Sang too had 
to retreat. While wandering through forest after forest 
organising a strong army to meet Babar again on the battle 
field this high-minded Maharana Sang succumbed to incur­ 
able diseases in A.D, 1530,** and the Hindus lost a precious diadem. MOGHUL DYNASTY FOUNDED AT DELHI 
849, After this signal victory Babar grasped the Sultan­ 
ate of Delhi for himself in A,D, 1526, setting aside the 
original aspirant to that place, Subedar Daulatkhan Lodi of 
Punjab. This was the beginning of the Moghul Empire of 
Delhi. 
NOTABLE EVENTS IN THE REMAINING 
PROVINCES OF NORTH INDIA 
AT THE TIME 
850. SINDH:—The reconquest of Sindh from the Arab 
hands by the Hindus has already been noted (cf. Paragraphs 
655 to 656). Those Sumer Rajputs retained Sindh in their 
hands till A.D. 1336. In A.D. 1336 a Rajput King named. 
Jam Afra, was ruling there as an independent potentate**. 
There were constant wars between this Hindu monarchy and- 
the Sultans of Delhi. From A.D. 1367 to 1380 a Hindu monarch- 
named. Jam Timaji, ruled this province of Sindh. He was 
338 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
succeeded to the throne by another Eajput prince, who, 
however, because of many maladies, lost his balance of mind 
and voluntarily became a Muslim*'. 
851. BENGAL—When ultimately in A.D. 1192 Moham­ 
mad Ghori subjugatd the Sultanate of Delhi for ever, he sent 
many valorous chieftains under him to subdue the Hindu 
states round about. One of them, Bakhtyar Khilji, overcame 
the Hindu rule in Bihar and Bengal in A.D. 1195 and founded 
the Muslim rule there for the first time*'. Of his persecution 
•of the Hindus and especially of the Buddhists and their 
wholesale conversion to Islam we have already said enough 
in Paragraphs No. 342 to 356. On this very occasion this 
w i l d fiendish c o m m a n d e r o f t h e M u s l i m f o r c e s r a s e d t o 
the ground the world famous University of Nalanda** which 
had a glorious tradition of over five centuries to its credit. 
The Muslims set fire to the vast and invaluable collection of 
innumerable books, which kept burning, it is said, for six 
months**. But the Muslims never allowed anybody, to put 
the fire down before it quenched of itself and every written 
record was reduced to ashes ! 
WANT OP ARMED MIGHT RENDERS THE POWER 
SCINCE AS ALSO THE POWER OF RELIGION MISER­ 
ABLY HELPLESS—ONE MORE ILLUSTRATION ! 
852. In that vast burning library there were innumer­ 
able valuable books of the Vedic, Buddha, Jain other 
religions. But to protect them from fire came neither the 
Vedic Gods, nor Lord Buddha, no, not even Lord Jin ! The 
actual armed might of the devotees is the only armed stren­ 
gth the Gods seem to have ! 
853. In the end Bakhtyar Khilji conquered the last of 
the Sen Kings and after annexing Bengal started his 
campaign of the wholesale conversion of the Hindus to 
Islam^". 
854. The Muslim Subedars themselves rebelled from 
time to time against the paramount power of Delhi and call­ 
ing themselves the Sultans of Bengal, ruled the province 
independently. Fakruddin was the first of them to found his 
5TH GLORIOUS EPCOH 339 
independent sway over Bengal in A.D. 1347*^. Since then 
these Afghan Sultans ruled the province till A.D. 1576. Once 
in the meantime in A.D. 1386 a Hindu Jamindar named 
Kans overthrew this Afghan rule and established Hindu 
power in BengaP*. When this King Kans died in A.D. 
1392 his son Jitmalla came to the throne of Bengal. But to 
the greater discredit of the Hindus there this Hindu King 
Jitmalla once had the wanton caprice to court Islam and he 
changed his name to Jalaluddin^' ! And to the greater shame 
of the Hindus be it said that not a single Hindu throughout 
the whole of Bengal came forward to chastise Jalaluddin for 
this national crime. They acquiesced in the Muslim domi­ 
nation without a murmur ! 
855. One more capable Hindu Jamindar who was a 
proud adherent of Hinduism had nearly managed to do as 
much. But his efforts too ended in disaster. Of the few 
brave Hindu warriors who rose in rebellion against the 
Muslims and fought tooth and nail, the only one who can be 
ranked along with Rana Pratap and Baba Banda was 
Maharaja Pratapaditya of Jashodhar. Although his sphere 
of activity was not very large and although for want of 
active and potent support from the Hindu community he was 
in the end defeated, his name will ever be remembered in 
the history of HINDU independence movement ! 
856. KASHMIR:—Por want of space it is enough to say 
here that while the Muslims were wantonly subjugating 
•Gujrath, Malwa and other provinces of north India, Kashmir 
was completely immune from the Muslim influence till the 
fourteenth century of the Christian era, being governed by 
the Hindu Kings, sometimes potent enough, at others 
mildy, but always independently ! The last of its Hindu Kings 
was Sendev. The history of Kashmir is written by Pandit 
Kalhan under the name "Rajtarangini". This Sendev had 
appointed one Muslim, named Shahmir or Mirza**, to be some 
official of the state and later on raised him from post to 
post, until he was made the Chief Minister of the State. 
What happened elsewhere in the history of many Hindu States 340 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
also happened here and after the death of Sendev this very 
Muslim Minister treacherously destroyed this Hindu State 
on the strength of a very cleverly preconceived plan, and 
usurped the throne of Kashmir under the title 'Shamsuddin'^*» 
857. Of course, just as the Hindus ultimately liberated 
the whole of India from the Muslim hands similarly our 
Hindu Sikhs and Dogras not only freed Kashmir from the 
Muslim bondage but they also marched victoriously to- 
Laddakh on one side and to Gilgit on the other and proudly 
planted the Hindu standard there—but after fighting many 
grim battles and in course of time—some centuries 
afterwards ! 
C H A P T E R X I X 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GLORIOUS NEW HINDU EMPIRE OF VIJAYNAGAR 
858. Por the better convenience of the reader it is -advisable to recall at the very outset the chronology of 
•certain events. The first foreign—especially non-Hindu— large scale aggression on the Deccan was the one by AUa­ uddin on Devgiri in A . D . 1294. It was foUowed with precipitate haste by three or four such tremendous military oxpeditions up to A . D . 1318 under the intrepid yet cruel Muslim commanders like Maliq Kafur and Khushrukhan, who ruthlessly forced conversion upon thousands of Hindus. During these twenty-five years or so the Muslims over-ran practically the whole of the Deccan and wiped out of existence five or six ancient, famous and strong Hindu King­ doms from Devgiri to Malabar. 
858-A. Howsoever shameful and stigmatic this historical fact might be to the prestige and self-respect of the Hindu Nation, the Deccanese Hindu heroes, too, swallowed up, as it were, in one draught, as their ancient ancestor, Agasti Rishi, 
•did of yore, the doomsday flood of the Muslim warriors and hardly within a decade or so shattered the Sultanate of Delhi to pieces ! They raised in its place, at least in the Deccan, a grand victorious Hindu Empire of Vijaynagar. The lightn­ ing-like speed with which they achieved all this is also so creditable to the Hindu Nation, that we should, for ever, be proud of them and grateful to them. 
859. For even before the whole of the Deccan was subjugated in A.D. 1318, some of the indefatigable Hindu leaders, highly ambitious of re-establishing Hindu sway over the Deccan without delay had already begun establishing secret contacts with Khushrukhan himself. The Khan 
342 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
cherished in his mind daring plans of dispatching Sultan 
Mubarik after reaching Delhi and crowning himself as Sultan 
in his stead. But he knew full well that in this courageous 
bid for power even the bitterest of the Muslim enemies of the 
ruling Sultan would not have helped him in the least. But 
he could expect passive, even active, support from the Hindu 
Chiefs or Sirdars. For Khushrukhan himself had become 
most impatient to tear off his tawdry guise of Mohamma- 
danism, which was forced upon him, very much against bis 
will, and to appear in his original Hindu form. Naturally 
secret reports and slanderous complaints constantly reached 
the court of Sultan Mubarik at Delhi that Khushrukhan 
was in collusion with the recently overpowered Hindu chiefs 
and leaders of Hindu Society, and that some deep-laid 
mysterious plan was afoot. The reader should refer to a 
connected and plausible account of this whole affair, so far 
as it can be deduced from these various scattered bits of 
information that are so far available to us. (Paragraphs 754 
to 782). 
860. The founders of the Empire of Vijaynagar, Hari- 
har and Bukka, were the two sons of Sangam of the ancient 
Yadav family^. They were employed at the court of 
Anagondi*. During the turbulent times following the Muslim 
conquests of Devgiri and Warangal in the reign of AUauddin 
the Kingdom of Anagondi, too, was overpowered by the 
Muslims. Anagondi itself or some place nearby was the 
former city of Kishkindha of Wall, as the folklore goes*. 
After the downfall of Anagondi Harihar and Bukka were 
taken as captives to Delhi in A.D. 1327 and were converted 
there to Islam*. Later on being pleased with their behaviour 
and exceptional ability, the Sultan sent them both with a 
new expedition to fight with the Hindus in A.D. 1331, with 
higher authority and responsible posts*. But as soon as they 
came to the Deccan,— 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 343? 
MOST PROBABLY AS PER A PRECONCEIVED PLAN 
861. They paid a visit to the then chief preceptor of 
Sankeshwar Math, Shree Shankaracharya Vidyaranyaswami 
who was a skilled politician too. Immediately the Shanka­ 
racharya himself re-converted these two converted Hindus* 
who promptly raised a Hindu army and defeated the Muslim 
host which they themselves had led a short time ago. Soon 
in consultation with Shankaracharya Vidyaranyaswami and 
many other brave Hindu leaders, it was decided to found an 
independent sovereign state on the banks of the river 
Tungbhadra'. The capital was established at the newly 
founded city of Vijaynagar Av^hich bespoke of Hindu victory. 
The reins of this kingdom were placed in the hands of Shree 
Harihar in A.D. 1336 while Shri Vidyaranya himself became 
his chief minister*. 
862. At this very stage it is advisable to explain one 
enigmatic episode which is not yet so explained by historians. 
The event in question is the transfer of the capital from 
Delhi to Devgiri by Mohammad Tughlak, who is considered 
'crazy' but who was, in fact, a 'learned fool*, without any 
practical sense. His decision to shift the Capital of his 
Empire from Delhi to Devgiri is considered to be his wayward 
caprice. But it was not a pure whim of his. It was to 
consolidate his victories in the Deccan that were gained by 
his generals and to rule that region effectively that he 
thought of having his capital in its very midst*. Again his 
precipitate decision to shift his capital back to Delhi which 
resulted in untold sufferings for the people was also not his 
pure caprice. In fact, it was for the last ten years or so 
that the Muslim rule seemed to have stabilized itself in the 
Deccan, but it was most humiliating and so most hateful and 
unbearable to the H i n d u s . So a l l the H i n d u kings, a l l the 
Hindu religious preachers and law-givers and Hindu people 
at large were preparing feverishly though secretly to 
overthrow that alien rule", and the Muslim army had also, 
grown panicky about such an armed rising. The Sultan 
344 SrX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
realized the grave danger of his being involved in the meshes of this Hindu revolt and the possibility of his being destroy­ ed completely. That is why he hurriedly shifted his capital back to Delhi, far to the north—not simply because his caprice dictated it ! As a matter of fact it was the panic about this growing armed strength of the Hindus that caused all these crazy and contradictory moves of his ! 
863. One more important event of this time has equally bafSed the historians, but it is far too strange to be set aside. It is this Sangam whose young sons, Harihar and Bukka, were taken captives by the Muslims, was in fact, closely related to the Kings of Anagondi and Warangal. Naturally these two sons were also fairly well connected with these royal families. It was for this particular reason that Mohammad Tughlak took them to Delhi and converted them to Islam. On many Hindu kings and princes had fallen this calamity of being forcibly converted to Islam, but even if they escaped afterwards from such a calamity, they had, unfortunately, no hope of being absorbed in the Hindu society. The stumbling block was that of the ban on reconversion to Hinduism. (Paras 379 to 403). How then and from what source, did this inspiration arise, which actuated the two young warriors, Harihar and Bukka, to seek reconversion to Hinduism, which again emboldened Shankara­ charya Vidyaranyaswami to preside over and effect this re-coversion, totally disregarding the staunch public opposi­ tion and all the rules and regulations laid down in the interpolated chapter on Kalivarjya Prakarna, and which finally made many other Hindu men of action to follow up this new movement ? 
864. The answer to this riddling question is to be found in the unprecedented politico-religious revolution brought about some ten or twelve years ago by the Hindu Samrat Dharmarakshak (Nasir-ud-din) ac Delhi. Por Sultan Nasir-ud-din himself was originally a Hindu, who was forciby converted to Islam. But because of the fondness and infatua­ tion of AUauddin and his son he was given the title of 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 345 
Khushrukhan and was gradually raised to be the commander 
of a huge Muslim army to invade the South. Till the 
moment he became suflSciently powerful, Khushrukhan 
outwardly maintained his Muslim garb; but as soon as he 
returned from his southern campaign he cut off the Muslim 
Sultan, Mubarik, and crowned himself as Hindu Emperor 
proudly proclaiming that he was originally a Hindu and that 
he was re-embracing that religion once again. Not content 
with this, he reconverted hundreds of such unhappy converts 
to Hinduism, and changed the Muslim Masjids into Hindu 
Temples ! The exciting news of this unheard of but success­ 
ful, attack of Hindutwa (fffc^) upon the Muslim empire and 
Muslim religion, had already reached the farthest corners of 
India. Naturally when Harihar and Bukka were stationed 
at Delhi as captive Muslim converts at the orders of the 
Muslim Sultan, they must have heard the excited discussions 
about this very recent happening, which must have egged 
them on to attempt some such seemingly impossible feat of 
escaping to the Deccan with a large army. So they must 
have simulated to Mohammed Tughlak that they were 
staunch Muslims and as such deserved his fullest confidence, 
and that is why Mohammed Tughlak appoined Harihar and 
Bukka at the head of the Muslim army in that region. When 
Miohammed Tughlak shifted his capital from Devgiri to 
Delhi he could not keep sufficient army in the South to 
protect the imperial territory in the Deccan. So when the 
news of the probable rising of the Hindus came to his ears, 
he decided to send these two warriors to strengthen the 
imperial position in the south because in the first place they 
were closely connected with the royal Hindu families of the 
Deccan and secondly because they were now trustworthy 
Muslims. Harihar and Bukka, too, got the wished for oppor­ 
tunity and showed all the eagerness to execute the tasks set 
to them. It was an established practice of the Sultans of 
Delhi to send the converted Hindus to extend the imperial 
l)oundaries and such attempts bore rich fruit, as can be seen 
in the case of Maliq Kafur and others. With the apparent 
346 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
determination to destroy the Hindu revolts in the Deccan, Harihar and Bukka took leave of the Sultan and with the Muslim army went straight to their own States of Anagondi and Warangal. 
865. In all probability they must have passed on to Shree Swami Vidyaranya and the rest of the Hindu kings in unmistakable terms the information as to their secret plans and their real intention, long before they reached the Deccan. They had given Sultan Mohammed Tughlak the slip and were now to embrace Hinduism openly. Hindu Samrat Nasir-ud-din's successful miltary coup in Delhi had already given the impetus to the Deccanese Princes and the priests like Shankaracharya. Naturally with the approval of Harihar and Bukka, Vidyaranyaswami and other Hindu leaders decided to recovert them to Hinduism with the ceremonial rites. 
866. Our observation at the end of the Seventeeth Chapter that the political revolution which Shree Dharma­ rakshak (Nasir-ud-din) effected at Delhi had far-reaching consequences can also be proved by the influence that great event exerted on the establishment of the Empire of Vijay­ nagar. Even then that great event has been so far referred to with contempt and in insulting terms ! It only shows that modern historical text-books lack the Hindu point of view, and hence they are merely blind to some such events ! 
867. The proud achievement of the Hindu generation which established the new Hindu Empire of Vaijaynagar has not been sufiiciently glorified in Hindu histories. The case of Madhavacharya, the Shankaracharya of Sankeshwar, Vidya­ ranyaswami is the one in point. It has already been pointed out how great a political revolutionary this exceptional personality was ! But the fact that he was an equally great revolutionary in matters of religion, can be proved by hi& repudiation of the old traditions by re-converting the two princes, Harihar and Bukka. In a similar way he was the synacure of the then learned-world. He wrote several treatises on several subjects, of which 'Sarwadarshan Sangrah' 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 347 
and 'Panchadashi' are the most renowned. No other abler 
Shankaracharya seems to have ascended the seat of Shringeri 
or any other monastery after the First Shankaracharya f 
Especially his arch diplomacy and political wisdom seen in 
the rapid growth of the Hindu Empire of Vijaynagar in the 
teeth of Muslim opposition bears no comparison ! 
867-A. Indeed the names of Vidyaranyaswami, of the 
warrior kings, Harihar and Bukka, Harihar the second, who 
took the proud title of Maharajarihiraj, and his Chief Minister 
Sayanaoharya—the brother of Vidayaranyaswami, whose 
critique of the Vedas is still accepted as an authority, 
Maharajadhiraja Krishnadevray and the last but not the least, 
Maharajadhiraja Ramrai also, who had inflicted crushing 
defeats in rapid succession on all the five Muslim States in 
Maharashtra viz., Adilshahi, Nizamshahi and others, but 
who was in the end killed in the forefront of the bloody 
battle against the combined Muslim forces, should really be 
honoured in every home and be remembered by everybody 
as are those of Rana Pratap, Raja Chhatrasal, Govind Sinh^ 
Chaitanya, Banda Bairagi and other great men of those 
times. But today North-Indian Hindus seem to have never 
heard of them while in the South hardly one in a thousand 
seems to know them but faintly, This is most shameful 
for the Hindus and this state of things must be changed 
forthwith. 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BAHAMANI 
KINGDOM 
868. Seeing the disintegration of the sovereign power 
of the Sultan of Delhi, set afoot by the Hindu State of 
Vijaynagar in the south, Hassan Gangu, the Muslim Governor 
of the Southern Muslim possessions, revolted against the 
Delhi Sultanate and proclaimed himself Sultan of the so- 
called Bahamani Kingdom in A.D. 1346. His domain spread 
from the Narmada in the north to the Krishna in the soutyi. 
The rulers of Delhi completely lost their hold on the south,. 
348 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
which was now to be ruled by two prominent powers : The Bahamani Kings and the Hindu Princes of Vijaynagar. The name Bahamani, which Hassan Gangu adopted for his kingdom is explained away by the historians in two different ways. It seems that this Hassan Gangu was a domestic servant with a Hindu Brahmin, named Gangu, when the former was but a slave. Pleased with his loyal service, the Brahmin looked into his horoscope and prophesied that the slave Hassan would, sometime in the future, become a king. Mad with joy to hear this prophesy Hassan began to style himself as Hassan Gangu, and when he actually got the sovereign power over the Deccanese sector of the Muslim empire, he designated it as the Bahamani kingdom thinking it to be the fruit of blessings of his former Brahmin master". Some other historians suggest another derivation for the name Bahamani Kingdom. They say that perhaps Hassan Gangu might have felt that he belonged to the Bahamani stock, a princely line­ age from Persia. If it be so, why did Hassan continue till the end to call himself Hassan Gangu which clearly referred to his Brahmin master ? Moreover, what proofs are there to show his descent from the Persian Bahamani royal family ? There is none forthcoming so far ! 
869. This Bahamani Kingdom and the Vijaynagar empire had a common boundary, the Tungbhadra river. Naturally intermittent warfare between these two rival states was the result. Those who want to read a more detailed account of the Vijaynagar empire and its wars with the Bahamani Kingdom should read with profit two books viz : (i) 'The Forgotten Empire' by Eobert Swell and (ii) 'The Never To Be Forgotten Empire' by Dr. S. Krishnaswami Aij^anagar. The second book so to say is an answer, at least to a certain extent, to the first one by an English scholar". 
870. As this one, far from being a book of history, is in fact an interpretation of history (as we have been saying from the beginning,) we shall restrict ourselves to those events only which are relevant to our purpose. For there 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 349 
is no room here for any detailed historical account. 
FOUNDATION 
THE BUILDING OF THE CITY OF VIJAYNAGAR 
871. The site selected on the banks of,the Tungabhadra 
for the capital city of Vijaynagar by the great Hindu 
leaders of the day such as Vidyaranyaswami and others, 
was from the architectural and military points of views, so 
beautiful and well fortified, surrounded as it was by hills 
on the three sides and a deep river on the fourth, that the 
architectural and militray acumen in the selection of this 
site has been highly praised by the several foreign travel­ 
lers well-versed in these two sciences^*. There was as it 
were a natural fortification for this vast city. There were 
seven strong enclosures, one within the other, round this 
city of Vijaynagar^^. In every one of these enclosures there 
were majestic buildings, beautifully carved temples, and 
rich palaces and pleasant lakes^*. On all these buildings, 
temples and royal palaces flew the saffron coloured (vjq^J flag 
masked with a golden cup. For, the authorized standard 
of Vijaynagar was the same traditional flag of the Hindu 
Nation, the saffron-coloured banner ! 
872. Of all these temples the grandest, most magnifi­ 
cent and spacious was that of Shree Nursinh, for he was 
the presiding deity of the royal family of Vijaynagar^'. In 
as much as very few temples are found to be dedicated to 
this God, Nursinh, throughout the length and breadth of 
India, the genius and practical sense those kings of Vijay­ 
nagar who chose for their daily worship this incarnation of 
Nursinh from amongst many others of the Hindu pantheon, 
are undoubtedly praiseworthy. 
873. For in those days of bitter warfare between the 
most cruel and diabolic Muslim invaders on the one hand 
and on the other the tolerant Hindu Society emasculated 
to suffer persecution and indignities to the last limits of 
endurance by the thoughtless preaching of the Buddhist cult 350 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
from the days of Gautam Buddha himSelf, it was this incar­ nation of Nursinh which could inspire in spineless Hindus of the day instinctive and effective reaction to retaliate every wrong done them, and also violent valour which could strike terror in the hearts of the enemy. 
874. ^srftr ^ ^sfsnr: TTT^IT I ^m\fk% ^ ^ Trfe: ii 
(Those dull-witted who do not behave knavishly with base and crafty rogues invariably court failure ! A polite person should be treated politely while a crafty scoundrel should be destroyed by super-craft.) 
THE SELF-SAME STORY OF NURSIJSIH ITSELF TELLS that not with the perverted virtues of Pralhad but Avith the cruel, crafty measures alone could that demon, Hiranya- kashipu, be killed. 
875. Shree Shankar had blessed Hiranyakashipu with a boon that he would not be killed by any man or beast, with any weapon or missile, ordinary or charmed with magic power, on the earth or in the skies, neither by day nor by night, neither in nor out ! But mysteriously enough an effective expedient was found for every one of these thought­ less terms of the equally thoughtless boon and the enemy of the Gods, the invincible demon, Hiranyakashipu, was killed by an incarnation which was neither purely human nor purely beasty, but a mixture of both, at twilight, on the threshold, taking him on the lap and by cutting open his stomach with his sharp talons ! 
875-A. It is this firightfnl incarnation of God, whose whole body has been besmeared with the spouts of blood emanating from the dying body of the wicked demon, rending the whole universe v.'ith his horrible war-cries, and at whose furious visage, made ten-times more terrible by his beard standing erect, even the Gods themselves were alarmed and began to request him to calm down, that a Nation wishing to keep itself alive in this diabolic warring world should worship as the emblem of the high peak of national valour ! 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 351 
876. This story also implies another noble principle, 
that although the outward appearance of his violent incar­ 
nation of Nursinh was fierce and repellant, its heart was 
that of a human being, made of the 'milk of human 
kindness'. Its merciless valour also is most essential, even 
unavoidable, to the development of 'human kindness' ! For 
this violent act of tearing open the entrails of Hiranya- 
kashipu, a reckless tyrant, a terror to Gods and demons alike, 
was performed solely to protect a devotee of the Gods, 
Pralhad, and that too as the last remedy ! It is for the sake 
of free development of human virtues that the principle of, 
^ff9T (non-violence), which emasculates human beings with 
the curse of weakness, should at times be killed by cruel 
violence ! It itself becomes a truly righteous, a truly religious, 
act leading to the development of human culture ! At a 
particular stage of development of the human society 
throughout the world, and at the tumultuous times when it 
was surrounded by different warring nations, fired with the 
inordinate selfish ambition and diabolic violence, the Hindu 
nation, too ought to have chosen Nursinh as its God of 
worship, if it wanted to preserve its free existence or even its 
invincibility ! 
877. The magnificent temple of this Nursinh whom the 
kings of Vijaynagar had offered their devout hearts does not 
stand there today in its original form. When the Muslim 
invaders attacked and devastated Vijaynagar in A.D. 1565, 
they also demolished and rased to rubble this royal temple 
of Nursinh^^. However whatever ruins are left over that 
old idol of Nursinh in that temple are even now sufficiently 
clear to signify the originally huge, magnificent, furious figure 
of that God-head, and we can easily imagine how very 
majestic and awe-inspiring the temple in its original form 
and glory might have been, distinguishing itself from the 
other huge, magnificent temples all over India by its 
inimitableness*". 
352 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
BAHAMANI SULTAN DEFEATED BY THE KING OF VIJAYNAGAR 878. After the death of the valiant Harihar, the brave Bukkarai ascended the throne of Vijaynagar. This Bukkarai too was of a daring and aggressive nature. He not only saved his own kingdom but also waged counter-offensives on the Muslims round about the year A.D. 1374 and defeated Majahid Shah, the great Sultan of the Bahamani kingdom^!. There is proof to show that this King Bukka had sent a friendly mission to the King of China^^. 
879. In A.D. 1379 this brave monarch of Vijaynagar, Bukkarai, died and was succeeded to this ancestral throne by his son Harihar II, born posthumously to his queen Gowri^*. During his reign the Hindus inflicted frequent and crushing defeats on the Muslims and extended the boundaries of Vijaynagar empire, whereupon Harihar took for himself the title of Maharajadhiraj with a grand ceremony to grace the occasion with the brother of Madhavacharya (Vidyaranya­ swami) Shree Sayanacharya himself as the Chief Minister of his and Sudha, Isag and Gund, the well-known commanders in his army. Maharajadhiraj Harihar ruled prosperously and extended the boundaries of his Empire to include Goa, as is borne out by a copper plate inscription dated A.D. 1391^*. 
880-881. It is impossible and unnecessary to give the lineages of the Vijaynagar or any other royal families in this volume. It is enough to say that the kings who succeeded Harihar II also added to the glory of Vijaynagar. There was only one unhappy exception of a weak and imbecile king named Devrai who came to the throne in A.D. 1406. He did hate the Muslims, but he found a strange expedient for destroying the Muslim powers, that of employing Muslim warriors in his army, as the Muslim rulers employed the Hindus ! But seeing his weak and vacillating nature those Muslim warriois in his employ became so very conceited that they refused to bow down to him in his very courtly assembly ( ^ R ) saying rudely that barring one Allah they 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 363 
never bowed their heads before any mortal ! So for their 
satisfaction Devrai had the Book of the Koran placed on a 
high pedestal beside him, so that when they bowed, the 
Muslims were satisfied that they did so to the Koran and not 
to the King, whereas the King was satisfied that the decorum 
of the assembly was not violated** ! He even went to the 
length of building a Masjid in Vijaynagar in order to please 
those Muslims*'. It is needless to say that these pampered 
Muslim soldiers did not fail to betray Devrai in the very 
thick of the battle, and Devrai was defeated at last by the 
Bahamani Sultan, Phiroz Khan, who faithful to the demonic 
Muslim tradition, asked for the daughter of Devrai at the 
signing of the treaty and the latter had to concede the 
demand most shamefully and helplessly*' ! Fortunately 
during those two or three hundred years of Muslimascendancy 
hardly five or six kings followed this tradition of abject 
surrender of the Rajputs. Of course it must be remembered 
that no Hindu conqueror ever laid down this condition for 
the vanquished Muslims in the great victories that the Hindus 
gained in those days over the Muslims ! The reason is plain 
enough ! For, whoever thought of marrying Muslim girl 
would himself have been converted to Islam ! The evil 
effects of this perverted virtue of the Hindus have been dealt 
with in the chapters on the ban on reconversion 
(Paragraphs : 413 to 473). 
RETALIATION BY THE HINDUS 
882. However, after the death of Devrai, the kings of 
Vijaynagar began to avenge this ignoble defeat on various 
battlefields and once again the Muslim powers were overawed. 
Especially in A.D. 1417 when Phiroz Khan invaded Telengan, 
the Hindus routed the Muslim forces killing their very 
Vazir*8. 
882-A. Round about A . D . 1460 there was a bitter 
struggle for power in the royal family of Vijaynagar in the 
reign of Virupaksha. Availing himself of this opportunity 
a mighty Vijaynagar Chieftain, Shalva Narsinh by name. 
364 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
dethroned Virupaksha and thus ended the original Sangam dynasty, by assuming sovereignty and establishing order throughout the kingdom^^. 
THE ADVENT OF THE WESTERN NATIONS IN INDIA 
883. During this very period the European, Portuguese discovered a sea route to India and entered the Indian political arena*". Their first entry was not effected in Vijaynagar; it was the coastal Prince Samudrin (Zamorin) to the southern corner of India who was their first host. This seemingly insignificant event is recorded here merely for keeping up the time-sequence. The new locust-like aggression of the western powers which followed it will have to be reviewed in a separate chapter. 
MAHARAJA NARESH 
884. Eollowing the thread of the history of Vijaynagar it must be said that during one or two generations this second royal dynasty of Shalva Narsinh was in its turn overthrown when another military commander, Naresh by name, assassinated the then ruling monarch, and established the third ruling dynasty of Vijaynagar in A.D. 1507. In all these three political revolutions one remarkable thing is noticeable that even when the Muslim States were waiting most anxiously to destroy this Hindu Empire, and even when these Hindu-Muslim states were constantly at war, these political revolutions took place amongst the Hindus them­ selves. The surrounding Muslim states got no opportunity to lend a helping hand to one contending Hindu side against the other and thus force their grip on it, nor had they the courage to do il*^. 
THE BREAK-UP OF THE BAHAMANI KINGDOM 
886. Before the third political revolution in Vijaynagar was effected the Bahamani Kingdom of the Muslims was b r o k e n u p i n t o five. T h e B a h a t n a n i S u l t a n s first o f a l l 
•5tH GLORIOUS EPOcii' 355 
Extended their boundaries from the Narmada to the Tunga- fchadra, but as its boundaries reached those of Vijaynagar, there was constant warfare between the Hindu-Muslim States. The many victories that the Vijaynagar kings won over the Muslims effected the annexation of Gomantak to the Hindu Kingdom and the extension of its boundaries right upto Orissa. As a natural consequence of these Hindu victories the Bahamani power weakened considerably. More­ over the last of its monarchs were absolutely worthless. Mohammed Gawan, the last Bahamani Vazir, however, was able and warlike in spirit. Because of his honest and diligent service, his valour and prudence that Muslim state managed 
to exist somehow between A.D, 1484 and 1526. But some Muslim noblemen, who were Mohammed Gawan's enemies at the court, contrived to have him killed by royal order'*. It must be remembered that however great Mohammed Gawan might be, like practically every other Muslim ruler he never left anything undone to persecute the Hindus in the Bahamani Kingdom, Yet he met his doom, not at the hands of the Hindus, but at those of his own Muslim colleagues, 
886, Even before the death of Mohammed Gawan the Sultan's capital had been shifted to Bidar, and after his death that feeble Muslim power was broken up into the following £ve parts. 
1. Adilshani of Vijapur, 2. Imadshahi of Berar (Varhad or Vidarbha (1484- 
1503). 3. Kut-b-Shahi of Gowalkonda. 4. Nizamshahi of Ahmednagar (1489 to 1637). 5. Baridshahi of Bidar. 887. Two remarkable things about this break up of the Bahamani Kingdom should well be remembered especially by the Hindus. The first is that the founder of Imadshahi of Berar (second in the above list) was origina,lly a' Telangi Brahmin". His father lived in Vijaynagar, In one of the battles with Vijaynagar this son of a Telangi Brahmin was captured by the Bahamani Muslims, who, true to their 
356 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
wicked custom, converted him to Islam'*. He was thereafter raised to a higher status by the kindness of Gawan. At last in A . D . 1484 he divorced himself from the Bahamani Kingdom and as a Muslim took for himseif the proud title of Imadshah and proclaimed himself an independent ruler of the Province of Berar, relegated to his charge'^. 
888. The second remarkable fact is that of the founda­ tion of the Nizamshahi of Ahmednagar, the fourth fragment of the Bahamani Kingdom. At Vijaynagar there was a Brahmin named Timmappa Bahiru (Bhairao ?) whose son was taken captive and converted to Islam, when Ahmedshah was at war with Vijaynagar'^. He was renamed Ahmed. When this convert Ahmed was posted at the command of a big Muslim army he utilized his authority to break loose from the Bahamani domination and established his own Sultanate in A.D 1489". Because of his title of the Nizam his sultanate came to be known as Nizamshani. In his domain was situat­ ed the famous fort of Shivneri. Somewhere between Daulatabad and Junner there was a small village called 
•Binkar'. Finding it suitable for his capital he named it as Ahmednagar after his own name Ahmed in A.D. 1494''. 
889. This break up of the Bahamani Kingdom was mainly due to the internal dissensions of the Muslims. The original Bahamani Kingdom had vowed to destroy Vijay­ nagar. But the latter survived to see the break up of the Bahamani Kingdom into five fragments and continued to fight adamantly with all those five Muslim States, and proved to be more than a match to all of them for at least seventy- five years to come ! 
890. The claim that the Muslims never fought amongst themselves is once again belied by this five-fold fragmenta­ tion of the Bahamani kingdom which was caused by their internal rivalries. That the Muslim Sultans looked for help at the mighty Hindu empire of Vijaynagar in order to put down their Muslim rivals gives the lie to their second boast that they never sought help from the Hindus ! 
-5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 357 
MAHARAJADHIRAJ KRISHNADEVRAI 
891. To the above-mentioned Tuiuv dynasty of Naresh 
•of Vijaynagar belonged the mighty emperor Krishnadevrai 
-who ruled from A.D. 1509 to 153C. He was well-educated 
and his address was clever and pleasing. He impressed even 
the greatest of scholars of the time. The learned scholars of 
•of Sanskrit, Telegu, Tamil and Kannad literatures were 
.generously patronized by his court*". In his court were 
eight great poets whom he called '5r^af^«t' ("Elephants of 
the Eight Directions".) He himself was a great writer. His 
Telegu book named 'sng^T ^c*)^' is very well-kno-wn". 
Maharaja Krishnadevrai was equally fond of architecture 
and sculpture. He it was who got the famous Ram Mandir 
of Vijaynagar built, besides the many forts, ramparts, temples 
•courtyards, monasteries and caravan sarais throughout his 
empire**. He made munificent grants to the Brahmins and 
temples**. His career shines with his various virtues such 
as courteous behaviour, dexterity in discourse, prudence in 
politics, his long-range view in chalking out plans and 
formulating policies and last but not the least, his sternness 
and valour in respect of the enemies. Western and other 
foreign historians have unanimously praised him as an 
unrivalled great ruler** ! 
892. If Maharajadhiraj was most civil with the gentle 
folks, he was unrelenting and merciless when he fought 
bravely with the enemies of his religion or those of his 
nation ! Victory graced him in his bitter war with Adilshah**, 
whereupon the treaty he effected with the Adilshahi Sultan, 
laid down such acrid terms as completely crushed down the 
Muslim swaggering claims of invincibility**, established the 
superiority of the Hindus, and were accepted by the abject 
Muslim rulers with great reluctance. 
893. His army was vast and powerful. It comprised of 
seven hundred thousand foot, twenty-two thousand cavalry 
and five hundred and fifty-one elephants ever prepared for 
"war*'. 894. The glory of Vijaynagar reached its zenith in the 
358 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
times of Maharaja Krishnadevrai, which can be proved beyond a doubt by the various detailed accounts written by fliany foreign travellers who visited his court*'. Many of them have even described his appearance. He was very handsome to look at, a man of action and a very powerful personality to impress at first sight any visitor**. 
895. He was a Vaishnav himself, yet he gave the same sympathetic and tolerant treatment to the Vedic Hindus, who were in a majority, and to the other minorities like the Jains, Lingayats, Mahanubhavas and other Hindu sects,, avoiding every sort of clash of dissentient opinions and thus tried to cultivate amongst the Hindus the feeling of oneness- by means of his compromising attitude^". From the incep­ tion of the Empire of Vijaynagar the great Hindu leaders like the Shan kara chary a, Vidyaranyaswami and Sayana­ charya and others had adopted a wise policy of assimilation,, equality and tolerance which precluded every sort of clash between any two religious sects, while their religious- preaching fostered high respect for their Hindu religion and their Hindu national sentiment^^. Foreign travellers refer most admiringly to this religious tolerance and the sense of equality that the Vijaynagar kings always showed. 
THE PROSPERITY AND THE GLORY OF THE HINDU EMPIRE OF VIJAYNAGAR. 
896. Foreign travellers have very highly praised not only the civic and religious liberties that the people of Vijaynagar enjoyed, but also its overall prosperity and glory, and the powerful influence that it wielded far and wide* For instance when the Portuguese traveller, Duarte Barbose, visited Vijaynagar and stayed there for a while he was very much astonished to see its exceptional wealth and glory^^. 
897. The ambassador from the Shah of Persia has clearly said, "The like of this city is nowhere to be found on the face of this earth''. Adjoining the royal palace there were four-fold extensive market places for jewellery and pearls. Foreign travellers have written that thousands of 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 359- 
citizens weie to be seen adorned with ornaments of gold, 
jewels and pearls. Portuguese traveller Paes asserts that the 
area of Vijaynagar was as extensive as that of Rome. 
898. Even before the reign of Maharajadhiraj Krishna­ 
devrai the Hindu Empire of Vijaynagar had been renowned 
as the most powerful in the whole of Deccan. The five' 
fragments of the former Bahamani Kingdom were beset with 
internal dissensions and fratricidal wars, to the immense- 
advantage of Vijaynagar Empire, and the then Hindu 
political leaders did have the sense to utilize this opportunity 
for the extension of its boundariea and for teaching a lesson 
to the Muslims. The Muslim Sultans could do nothing 
independently without the help or consent of the 'Rais' of 
Vijaynagar ! Every one of the Muslim cliques laboured hard 
to secure the support of the Hindu rulers of VijaynagarTM. 
As has already been said above the absurd patronization by 
the Hindus and their indulgence of the Muslim soldiers, as 
in the times of the weak and imbecile King Devrai, had been 
abandoned. Those of the Hindu Kings, who built Masjids 
for the Muslims in their own capital, did so in order to win 
them over and to parade their religious tolerance. But now 
that 'cowardly' religious tolerance had given place to valiant 
aggression on the Muslim States and the retaliatory demoli­ 
tion of the Muslim mosques and Masjids**. Porbearan duece 
to the perverted sense of virtues began to give the palm of 
honour to the real virtue of retaliation ! 
899. Maharaja Krishnadevrai died in A.D. 1530. Just 
four years before it Babar had captured Delhi. Rana Sang 
was his contemporary. He was succeeded by his brother, 
Achyutdev, with Salur Timma for his Chief Minister, who for 
all practical purposes ran the administration.. Achyutdev 
died in A . D . 1542 and then after an insignificant king 
Sadashivrai, the nephew of Achyutdev, ascended the throne. 
But Ramrai, the son of the Chief Minister, Timma, had done 
so much in helping Sadashivrai become the king, that within- 
a very short time all the real power passed into his hands**. 
This Ramrai himself is called Ramrajah. 360 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
fiAMRAI, THE VALIANT DEFENDER OF RELIGION ! 
900. All the five Muslim States in Maharashtra tried to obtain help from the powerful army of Eamrai to fight their fratricidal wars. Although these five Muslim rulers knew well enough that Shree Ramrai was a strict adherent of Hinduism and hated all Muslims alike as equally treacherous enemies of the Hindus and looked down upon them with scorn, still they had fully realized that without the powerful support of this valiant Hindu hero they could hold no ground before their adversaries. 
901. In A.D. 1543, the Nizamshah of Ahmednagar and Kut-b-Shah of Gowalkonda jointly thought of teaching a lesson to Adilshah, the Sultan ofVijapur. They implored Ramraja himself to take the lead^*. Accordingly the three together marched on Vijapur and went on slaughtering the Vijapur forces. The most noteworthy was the fact that even the Muslims came to know that the Hindus had been cured of the one hateful vice of the 'perverted virtues' which we have, so far condemned in this volume. (Paragraphs 401 to 473). For, on the religious front, too, the Hindus overcame the Muslims and in order to avenge the demolition and molestation of the Hindu temples they rased numerous masjids at various places to the ground^'. The houses of Muslims, the localities and townships where the Hindus were persecuted and Hindu women were treated most insultingly as slaves, were burnt and destroyed completely. This religious retaliation by the Hindus struck new terror in the hearts of the Muslims, and quite contrary to their age-old practice the Muslim community no more dared to tread upon the Hindu populations, as they would have upon the ants. It dreaded the resurgent Hindu society as it would have dreaded a poisonous snake. Naturally the Adilshah of Vijapur had to sue for peace and to please every one of the three^'. 
902. This temporary compromise did not end the Muslim feuds for ever. The Adilshah of Vijapur felt sore about the two forts of Kalyani and Solapur appropriated by the Nizamshah of Ahmadnagar. As such he decided to invade the 
•5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 361 
INizamshah in 1557 and entreated Ramrai to help him. So 
now along with the Vijapur army, the Hindu forces of Vijay­ 
nagar, which had gone out to help the Nizamshah, marched 
•on the Nizamshahi lands**. Needless to say that the very 
idea that all the five Muslim states should seek help from the 
Hindu State of Vijaynagar thrilled the hearts of the brave, 
while the common people came to lose their former fear- 
complex about the Muslim might. In this war with the 
Nizamshah, too, the Hindu forces punished the Muslims in 
the Nizamshahi lands and avenged the atrocities on the 
Hindus in earlier times on a larger scale and even more 
sternly and mercilessly than before**. Not only on the 
battlefield but even during their marches the heretofore 
arrogant attitude of the Muslims to the Hindus was also 
punished by way of reprisals in the form of plundering of their 
houses and property. The Muslim masjids had been destroyed 
in the very same way as the Hindu temples were demolished. 
'On the battlefields the Hindus simply routed the Muslim 
forces*^. 
903. This fierce retaliation by the Hindus to the Muslim 
fanaticism and devilish treatment of the non-Muslims that had 
gathered momentum during the last forty years or so, struck 
terror in the hearts of the Muslims, and they in their turn 
formed a new fear-complex about the Hindus. They began to 
complain most piteously that the Hindus perpetrated insults 
-and atrocities on them and even exposed their religion to 
ridicule and shame. 
THE DESTRUCTION OF VIJAYNAGAR 
904. All the five Muslim States in the Deccan and the 
Muslim society in general took a great fright at the defeat of 
Nizamshahi at the hands of Ramrai and especially the fierce 
reprisals that the Hindus had newly begun and were excited 
with extreme fear and anger. They came to realize that if 
they wanted their kingdoms to last and if at all they wished 
to live as Muslims it was absolutely necessary for them to 
forget their mutual grievances and launch a united and 
362 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
determined attack against the proud kings of Vijaynagar'^. For, they knew that none of them by itself was a match for the Vijaynagar Empire. So Adilshah of Vijapur and his Vazir Kishwarkhan decided to take. the lead in this daring project^'. Kishwarkhan personally went and interviewed the Nizamshah and Kut-b-Shah at their respective capitals, while all prominent Muslim Sardars and Mansabdars, and army chiefs and MuUa-moulavis preached jihad (crusade) everywhere**. In order to cement their mutual trust and newly formed friendship these Muslim Sultans intermarried their daughters and formed family-ties^^; and thus after a. thorough preparation the joint forces of all Muslim States- marched on Vijaynagar. 
905. Ramraja himself was not quite idle. Every now and then he got details about this secret plot of the Muslim. States. He was, in fact, an old man of seventy at that time, but his passion to fight with the Muslims had not grown a whit less in intensity than what it was in his youth. Undaun­ ted, he, too, equipped his army in every respect and made ready to meet the Muslim attack. He posted two big: divisions of his forces under the command of his two brothers Tirumalrai and Vyankatadri on two sides of the city, and he himself took the centre*'. 
906. The Hindu-Muslim armies met for a savage struggle- at Rakshasbhuvan (Rakkasgi-Tangadgi) near Talikot on Friday, the 2nd of January, 1565". Both the sides had good many cannons and they were arranged before the armies, tied fast with strong chains. The fact that for some time after the first shots were fired, there was fierce fighting and that the Muslims had a very hard knock which caused confusion amongst their ranks is admitted even by the Muslim histori­ ans*'. Enraged at this unpleasant turn of events and think­ ing that the slightest slackness might bring upon them all total ruin Sultan Husen Nizamshah dashed right on the centre and forcing a breach amongst the Hindu ranks, he- made straight for Raja Ramrai'*. The historians have no consensus of opinion about what exactly happened at the^

moment. Some say that a Muslim soldier in the pay of Ramrai himself treacherously killed himTM. Others declare that Raja Ramrai got down from his palanquin, sat on a jewelled throne in the centre of his army rewarding the feats of valour of his soldiers with gold and jewels, and encouraged them incessantly". Some others avow that when the battle reached its high pitch of ferocity the Muslims drove an into­ xicated elephant against the royal palanquin and slew him'*. Whatever that is, one thing is accepted on all hands that as soon as Raja Ramrai was encircled by the Muslims, they slew him and on the orders of Nizamshah his bloody head was exhibited on the sharp end of a long spear through the entire army. The sight of that gory head unnerved the Hindus and the Muslims closed in upon them with triumphant war-cries". 
907. In spite, of all this confusion wrought amongst the Hindu ranks Tirumalrai, the brother and Commander of Raja Ramrai, made haste to reach the capital city of Vijaynagar with many of the royal family, and before the Muslim forces arrived there he left for the south with whatever royal trea­ sure he could load upon five hundred and fifty elephants, and the remnant of his army, foot and horse. Mad with triumph, the Muslim armies soon came in hot pursuit of the defeated Hindu ones and not only did they capture the city but destroyed it completely with their traditional cruelty and animosity. They rased to the ground grand palaces, temples^ town-halls, beautifully laid out gardens, market places and colossal statues. Libraries of books were burnt to ashes;: crores of rupees worth of treasure was pillaged. The Muslim writers themselves state with evident pride that the infernal fires started in Vijaynagar by the Muslims kept burning for five or six months together'*. Thus perished the grand city of Vijaynagar at the hands of the Muslim demons in human form. 908-909. It is frivolous to say that the Muslims ravaged Vijaynagar only to avenge—only as a reaction to—the religi­ ous atrocities committed by the Hindus in return for the similar atrocities of the Muslims. It is not tenable against 
564 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
•the mass of evidence now available. 
910. But these writers, both the foreign and Muslim 'ones and also the Hindus with a perverted sense of virtues, do not see—do not remember—when they say so, what cause had the Hindus given to Mahmud of Ghazni, Mohammed Ghori, Taimurlang, Babar and others to invade them. They had never harmed any of them in any way. How many masjids in Ghazni had the Hindus burnt ? How many of the<Muslim subjects in the lands of Ghor or Ghazni had been oppressed and how many of their womenfolk had been raped by the Hindus ? How many millions of the Muslim women had been kept by the Hindus as concubines or maids ? What atrocities did the Hindus commit first on the Muslims for avenging which the above mentioned Muslim leaders marched towards India ? Did they not, each one of them, declare openly in their courts that it was solely for the sake of completely des­ troying the Hindus, for wiping out their race from the face of the earth and for converting them forcibly to Islam that they attacked the Indian continent ? 
911. While reviewing this destruction of Vijaynagar, it is enough to see if even the Muslim writers have the face to say that before the mighty armies of Allauddin and Maliq Kafur marched against the Deccan the South Indian Hindus had perpetrated any atrocities on non-Hindus in the north. If they cannot do so they should explain why the Muslim armies attacked the Hindus in the South and brought wholesale destruction on state after state from Devgiri, Warangal to Madurai, much in the same horrible form as was meted out to Vijaynagar. Why did they hurl insults and indignities at the Hindu religion and why did those • Muslim demons persecute the innumerable Hindu men and women ? Nobody can say by any stretch of imagination that is was to avenge the religious atrocities of the Hindus over the Muslims of the North. It was due to the fact that extirpating the Hindus was itself considered to be their religious duty—a holy faith as it were ! 
912. The unhesitating, shameless and open stand of the 
L 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 365. 
Muslim writers of the times and of those before and after is, 
"We believe that it is our chief religious duty to annihilate 
the non-Muslims. To conquer the kafir Hindu states, to rape 
the royal Hindu ladies, to enslave millions of other kafir- 
women and men, and to massacre others, to burn, devas­ 
tate and demolish the Hindu capital cities, their temples, 
the idols of their Gods, to reduce to ashes their libraries of 
religious books and do all sorts of wrongs to them were all 
the 'holy acts' of the Muslim Gazis—the defenders of the 
Muslim faith ! All these 'holy' acts were done to chastise 
the kafirs strictly according to the Muslim religious and ethi­ 
cal code, for their inexcusable (unpardonable) sin of being; 
kafirs ! When the kafirs call these holy acts atrocities, they 
must be plainly told that they were not atrocities at a l l !' 
They were all righteous and virtuous acts ! It is the bounden 
duty of every faithful follower of Islam that he must thus, 
chastise the kafirs whenever, and to whatever extent, he- 
might be able to do so. 
913. "But for the Hindus to call our religious chastise­ 
ment atrocities and to retaliate against our holy religion as 
a reaction against our so-called cruelties, to burn our pure 
masjids because we have burned their temples—it is simply 
diabolic !—atrocious in the extreme !" 
914. It is because the Muslims had this perverted con-- 
ception of their religious duty that they marched upoa 
Vijaynagar primarily as it was a Hindu State, and as the 
Hindus stubbornly refused to become Muslims. Even if the 
Vijaynagar armies had not invaded the Bahamani Muslim 
States, as they often did, and even if they had not retaliated 
with equal vehemence against the usual Muslim atrocities by 
burning their masjids and houses and plundering their 
property, all the Muslim Sultans would have attacked Vijay­ 
nagar Hindus simply for their fault of being Hindus. They 
would have committed the same inhuman atrocities, even if' 
the Hindus of Vijaynagar had not done them any harm, had, 
they but got an opportunity to do so ! 
.366 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INE>IAN HISTORV 
WHY DID THE MUSLIM ARMIES GO BACK AFTER THE PILLAGE OF VIJAYlNfAGAR ? 915. The underlying reason why the Muslim armies 
•drew back after pillaging Vijaynagar and did not pursue the fleeing Hindus is that they dared not do so; for the state of Vijaynagar had broken away from the old Hindu tradition of meek submission and tight-lipped endurance and had begun to reciprocate atrocities with counter-atrocities, and reprisals -with super-reprisals ! 
916. As has already been told above, Ramrai's brother, 
•Commander Tirumalrai, had already left Vijaynagar with his army into the South and was re-forming his forces for another knock. Had the Muslims advanced further they were 
•bound to meet with strong opposition from Tirumal's army. -Partly owing to this fear the Muslims retreated from Vijay­ nagar, content with whatever they could sack there. 
917. Another reason which was responsible for this speedy retreat was the opening of the 'old sores' among the Muslim Sultans ! Their belonging to different sects, like the Shias and Sunnis, had always created bickerings amongst them. Naturally, as soon as the hostilities with the Hindu state of Vijaynagar ended, their temporary alliance went to pieces and fresh warfare ensued'*. A little later when their arch-enemies, the Muslims in the North, the Moghal Emper­ ors, Shahjahan and Aurangzeb, invaded them with their invincible armies, they could not help looking for support from the then growing Maratha chieftains and their sturdy followers in Maharashtra. Being most mercilessly hammered from the North by the powerful Moghal armies and being internally eaten away by the very Maratha Sirdars who were called for help, these Muslim powers in the South peri­ shed one after another ! 
SHAHAJI, THE VALIANT! 
918» The most prominent of all these Maratha Sirdars, and the one in whom always blazed the secret ambition to 
•establish a Hindu power was Shahaji, the valiant, of the 
•6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 367 
Bhosale family. 
919. It has been already stated that after the collapse 
of Vijaynagar Tirumalrai and other Hindu princes fled to the 
South and established another independent Hindu principal­ 
ity at Penukonda in in A.D, 1567'*. Shreerang, Tirumalrai's 
son, removed his capital to Chandragiri after his father's 
death". Other princes, too, founded their small States, but 
they were, in fact, the fragments of the old Vijaynagar 
empire now set adrift after the deluge. Of the different 
'Nayaks' (Subhedars) of the Vijaynagar empire a few now 
consolidated their power and ruled independently. Some 
called themselves 'Palegars' and founded the states of Jingi, 
Tanjawar and other small Hindu states''. So even after the 
collapse of Vijaynagar the whole region south of the capital 
right up to Rameshwaram was under the Hindu sway'*. Later 
•still with the nominal suzereinty of the Sultan of Vijapur, 
Shahaji, as a Vijapuri Sirdar, established his 'de facto' over- 
lordship in the south and brought them all under his unifying 
control. Shahaji exerted a great influence as an able political 
•and military leader, because of his victories, right from 
Ahmednagar to Rameshwaram under every Muslim power, 
from the Moghals of Delhi to the moribund Sultanate of 
Vijapur. He was equally known everywhere as the staunch 
supporter of the Hindus ! His was the deciding vote in respect 
of the political manoeuvres in the south. A line from a con­ 
temporary poet, which became a common saying in those 
days, stated that the earth was ruled by the two guardians 
of directions'. 3tt W^fff ftlrl Wf^lt t I 
('Shahajahan in the north and Shahaji in the South.') 
920' For Shahaji thus to conquer the remnants of the 
Vijaynagar Empire in the name of a Muslim would at the 
first sight seem highly preposterous and would even smell of 
high treason against the Hindu nation. But it should, at 
the same time, be remembered that it is because he brought 
ah these scattered and vanquished Hindu states under his 
unified control that he could overawe his very Sultan and 
rule the South like an independent Hindu King at Mysore. 
368 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORV 
That he did this in order to root out all the Muslim Sultans- from the Deccan and to found an all-embracing powerful Hindu Kingdom can amply be proved by the fact that very soon one of his sons could set up an independent powerful and conquering Hindu Empire and that he could help him secretly in that great cause. That this 'insignificant' 'rebel­ lious' son of his could not have grown into a successful empire-builder without, not only the benevolent connivance of Shahaji, but also his active but secret assistance and guidance, requires no further elucidation*". Although for reasons of chronological sequence we may not name this illustrious son of Shahaji just yet, it must already have flashed like a lightning in the hearts of the readers ! There 
can be no doubt about it ! 
921. In similar circumstances, during the years A.D. 1316-1322, Khushrukhan commanded the Sultan's whole army at Delhi as a Muslim, because the Hindu military help was readily available, and conquered and consolidated forcibly the Southern Hindu States, which never united of their own accord, as parts of the vast empire of a Muslim Sultan; (Oh. XVII). And only after he succeeded in perfec­ ting the plans for his coup d' etat, did he kill the Sultan of Delhi overnight, ascending the throne himself as a Hindu monarch. He merely brushed aside, as it were, the lable 'Muslim' from the imperial throne and wrote in bold letters 'Hindu' over it. Within a day the all-India Khilji empire became a Hindu empire ! Again a little later when Harihar and Bukka were captured and made Muslims and were rotting in captivity at Delhi, they first employed the same Koutileeya code of ethics to win the confidence of the Sultan of Delhi under their Muslim garb. They invaded the rebellious Hindus of the South as Muslim commanders at the head of a Muslim army and aided by Muslim wealth; but at the earliest opportunity they joined the rebellious Hindus themselves and being reconverted to Hinduism founded a strong independent Hindu empire at Vijaynagar. The same Kontileeya strategy was used by Shahaji in conquering the 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 369 
Hindu States right upto Jingi and Tanjawar with the Vijapur 
army and at the Vijapuri expenditure and bringing them 
under the nominal sovereignty of the Sultan of Vijapur. 
Immediately after the fall of the Vijaynagar empire, Shahaji 
was consolidating the Hindu might to overthrow the Muslim 
domination and to establish a sovereign Hindu government, 
which was going to be far mightier than any gone before it, 
and which was destined to bring the final victory for the 
Hindus. This was the momentous job of laying the founda­ 
tion of the future Hindu victory that Shahaji was engaged 
in those perilous times ! 
922. Because of these heartening events the indomitable 
Hindu national aspiration could easily survive the grievous 
fall of Vijaynagar, whereas the Muslims (could not avail of 
it in the least, so as to shape the future in their favour! 
• CHAPTEIi XX 
THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY AND AFTER 
923. After having so far reviewed Indian History from the standpoint of the Hindu nation, we shall now take up some connected events of the sixteenth century and thereafter. 
SWARM OF EUROPEAN PIRATES INVADE INDIA 
924. The first of the European nations to invade India was Portugal. It was Vasco De Gama, the Portuguese navigator, who first rounded the Cape of Good Hope and discovered a straight sea-route to India. He was, however, guided by one of the captains of the Indian mercantile marine^, who plied to and fro between the Indian and the African coasts. In A.D. 1498 he first landed in the port of Calikat on the Western coast of India^, professing purely commercial interests which subsequently served to be a very fine pretext for the other Portuguese and European nationals who followed suit, to camouflage their secret territorial ambitions in India. Accordingly, immediately after two years in A.D. 1500 came Padro Alvaira's Cabral, another Portuguese admiral with thirteen warships fitted with guns and weapons under his command'. Seeing that the Muslim traders had already established themselves well in Cochin, he went there first to undermine their preponderance in inter-continental trade. From the beginning the Portuguese had cherished inveterate enmity towards the Muslims as a result of the horrible religio-political aggression of the latter on Spain and Portugal as has already been referred to in Paras 539 to 546. Later in A.D. 1509 Albouquerque 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 371 
wais made the Governor of the Portuguese possessions in 
India. He it was who conquered Goa and the surrounding 
territory from the Muslim Sultans of Vijapur in A.D. 1510*. 
It was he again who encouraged his Portuguese compatriots 
to marry, even with force and deceit, if necessary, Hindu 
.girls in order to ensure the permanent Portuguese settlements 
in India*. About this time the Portuguese priesthood 
•claimed that it was their supreme religious duty to 
proselytize the Hindus even with force, and made their king 
issue a royal order to that effect*. It is under this royal 
sanction that the Portuguese in Goa perpetrated the 
indescribable atrocities, rapes and various other outrages on 
the Hindus, men and women, there as are mentioned in Paras 
539 to 546 of this book. 
925. The patron-saint directing these blood-curdling 
Portuguese religious formalities was the Jesuit missionary. 
Saint Francis Xavier, whom the persecuted Hindus called 
•Satan incarnate ! He came to India in 1540. 
925-A. This so-called 'Saint' Xavier himself proudly 
states in one of his letters his triumphant success in 
the devilish persecution of the Hindus (see Paragraphs 539 
to 546). He himself and hundreds of other missionaries who 
came after him, converted innumerable Hindus to Christia­ 
nity with all sorts of brutalities and vandalism'. Countless 
Hindu men and women committed suicide to escape this 
violent persecution*. The Portuguese gradually conquered 
Div, Daman, Sashti, Vasia (Bassein), Choul, Mumbai 
(Bombay) on the Western coast of India and Saint Home 
near Madras, and Hugli in Bengal, of which Mumbai 
(Bombay was presented to the English King as a dowry in 
1668 (1661-2 ?) by the Portuguese King Charles IP. It was 
subsequently made over by King Charles II of England 
to East India Company for a nominal rent of £ 10 a year*". 
The rest of the region round about Bombay in the Portuguese 
possession was released by the Marathas. Goa was the only 
major possession left in the Portuguese hands. • 
926. The Dutch : —Quick on the heels of the Portueuese 
372 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
the Dutch of Holland entered India. The Dutch East India Company was formed in A.D. 1602 for the purpose^",, but they could not find a firm footing in India. Jawa and Sumatra, however, proved congenial to thetn. Hence they directed all their attention to that region and made it their stronghold. When the English began to dabble there, the- Dutch cut them all but one at Amboina, and ruled practically the whole of the Indonesian archipelago unhampered^i. 
927. The English :—Although the English East India Company was formed in A.D. 1600, it could not open its- first factory in India till A.D. 1608. Jahangir gave them, permission to open one at Surat in A.D. 1613^2. After a while in 1689 the monopoly of the British East India Company- was cancelled because of many malpractices and rivalries irt the Company's servants and another company was formula­ ted to carry on Indian Trade^'. But when it was seen that such competition was detrimental to the interests of the- British Nation as a whole the two companies were- amalgamated^*. 
928. As this British East India Company was later on. to enlarge the scope of her activities to such an enormous- extent as to encompass a foreign stupendous Indian empire, it is out of place and even impossible to discuss its extensive- history in these introductory remarks. Moreover, as the English were to meet the Marathas on the battlefields amidst, the clash of arms, the boom of cannons and the swaggering, wagers with empires as the tempting stakes, we would rather discuss it a little later so far as it will be possible to do so. 
929. The French: —Of the European nations who followed suit after the Portuguese and tried their hand at the eastern trade and the overseas empires the French were the last to appear on the scene. For the French East India. Company was floated as late as A . D . 1664^'. B u t they prospered quickly in their commercial activities. Why, if credit is to be given to any European who thought for the- first time of acquiring not only small scattered footholds. 
•5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 373 
but large empires in India and who tried to realize these 
ambitious schemes of his by large-scale military intervention 
in Indian politics, it was French Governor Dupleix". The 
next claimant to that honour is that vagabond and tempes­ 
tuous English youth, Robert Clive, who entered India as a 
•common soldier", but who soon came to command large 
a.rmies and to lay the foundations of the vast British Empire 
in India. The basic idea underlying the schemes of these 
two far-sighted young men was that with proper train­ 
ing great drilled and well-disciplined armies could be 
formed here in India out of the very Indian soldiers within 
•a very short time, and that, with competent, efficient and 
uncorruptible European military officers and commanders 
at the head of this very Indian army they could easily build 
up their strong Empires in India. It will be discussed in its 
proper place how great was the harvest that these daring 
schemes reaped in the years to come. 
930. It is, however, proper to discuss the French 
affairs in India to a certain extent. For although for a time 
the French and the English fought amongst themselves on 
the Indian soil and although they took opposite sides in the 
internecine civil wars of the Indian Kings and Princes, in 
the end the French were on losing grounds. Again their 
defeat at the hands of the English in the European theatres 
•of war rendered the French authorities in India thoroughly 
incapable of defending their positions against the ever 
increasing severity of the English attacks^*. The leaders 
like Dupleix, Busie, Suffren and others, who worked hard 
and spent the best of their energies for the expansion of the 
French empire in India, were very shabbily treated at home 
by the French people and the French Government". Nobody 
a,ppreciated their best efforts at the proper times nor gave 
them any support. Again this Indian army of the French 
fought against the Marathas on a few occasions, only to 
receive stunning blows and as such when it was clear that 
the chances of the French empire in India were almost nill, 
they began to help the Indian princes and especially the 
374 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Marathas particularly in respect of the training of the army and the use of the new guns. The English were very reluctant to help any native ruler create a disciplined army or to sell them newer weapons like the guns and cannons. But the Prench were only too willing to do that in exchange for large sums of money or substantial grants of land, and especially so, if that purchasing authority was engaged ini a struggle with the English. The Marathas, in particular, realized the inevitable greatness of the European type of training of troops and the production of the efficient new weapons of war like the various types of small and big fire-arms. Hence they employed French veteran military officers and their satellites in their armies. Ibrahim Khan Gardi, the famous artillery commander in the Maratha army at the battles of Udgeer and Panipat, had received his- training in that field in the French artillery divisions^". Later on Mahadaji Shiude (Scindia) employed French officers like De Boyne and M. .Perron as the chief commanders of their artillery and other divisions^^ and formed a well-equip­ ped, well-trained, mechanized army of his own. With this- well-trained strong army Mahadaji could over-awe the whole of the antagonistic north and vanquish the enemies ini various military engagements. But after a while the European Nations working in India had come to a certaia unwritten understanding, at least as regards India, that in the event of any Indian ruler fighting against any of the European nationals, no European army leader should take sides with the Indian and help him with his army. As such later on when Shinde (Scindia) was engaged in a deadly struggle with the English, De Boyne, who had been receiving thousands of rupees by way of salary, and the army trained by him flatly refused to fight^^. The Marathas, too, were conscious of such a treacherous behaviour on the part of these salaried foreigners some time or the other. Hence, the Marathas, on their part, had begun to open factories to manufacture similar guns and to prepare Indian officers to- train and drill the army on European lines. But in those 
5TH PLORIQUS EPOCH 375 
stormy days of incessant warfare it would have been unwise 
to depend solely on nothing but such trained army divisions. 
Even second rate states, like the Jats and the Sikhs, maintain­ 
ed such battalions. On the whole the existence of the Erench 
military might in India helped here and there to check the 
onward march of the British imperialistic power, and the 
Marathas, Tipu, the Sikhs and other Indian rulers did not 
fail to utilize it to that extent*'. 
THE SIMULTANEOUS ATTACK OF ALL THE NON-HINDU NATIONS OF THE WORLD ON THE DECCAN (SOUTH INDIA) 
931. When the European powers, mentioned above, 
invaded India they all did so by the sea. Naturally, their first 
tremendous onslaughts had to be borne and resisted by the 
Deccan and especially by the Marathas. Earlier, North India 
had to bear for six or seven centuries the whole brunt of the 
fierce and marauding attacks of the fanatical Muslims like 
the Moghals, the Turks, the Afghans, the Arabs and others, 
and had to offer them the sternest possible resistance. 
Eventually all these Asiatic Muslim nationals and the Barbar 
tribes fell violently upon the South with a view to conquer 
it for ever. Even while all these enemies were repeatedly 
invading from the North and the Deccan was engaged with 
them in bloody and deadly wars, in which thousands of 
Hindus were offering their precious lives for the sake of 
defending their religion, as they did in the North, the 
Southern Indian people were invaded, by the sea, by the new 
European Christian nationals, as numerous as the locusts 
themselves. The enemies crowded in upon the Deccan not 
only from the north-west or the north-east but also from the 
west. Not only by land but by sea also did all the combative 
marauding, aggressive and fanatic Muslim and Christian 
nations had simultaneously attacked the Deccan at the time 
to overrun the Hindu states there and to eradicate Hindu 
religion from the land. 
376 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
932. North India had to face only the Muslim nations, which itself was not an easy job. The deadly war that the Hindus had been fighting with the Muslims over centuries of years was as fierce and beset with all sorts of dangers as to exhaust even the Gods who had fought against the demons ! B u t the Deccan had the misfortune of facing not only a l l those Muslims but also the European Christian nations like the Portuguese and others who were even greater enemies of Hinduism than the Muslims and who tried every form of cruelty to proselytize the Hindus. And the South Indian Hindus—and especially the Marathas who had assumed their leadership in this war—showed the rarest tenacity and irresistible daring to repel single-handed these waves of aggression rising all round them. While thousands of Hindus had been fsacrificing their lives along with those of their wives and children on the religious front against the Muslims and the Portuguese Christians, as many others were fighting battles after battles and wars after wars on the political and military fronts. This exceptional struggle of the Hindus against foreign aggressors is worth a glorious mention in the history of the world. 
HINDU VIKRAMADITYA, HEMOO 
933. The many Rajput and Muslim states, who had collected together under the leadership of Rana Sang, and who had aspired to re-establish the Hindu empire had joined b a t t l e w i t h B a b a r a t K a n v a h . B u t a f t e r fierce fighting Rana Sang was finally defeated and Babar laid the founda­ tion of the Moghal empire at Delhi. Soon in 1530 Babar died and was succeeded by his son, Humayun, who in his turn was overcome by Sher Shah, the founder of the Sur dynasty. As Sher Shah Sur captured Delhi, Humayun had to wander in exile through various countries like Kabul, Kandahar, Persia and others, of which we need not give any detailed account. It is enough to say that even in the royal dynasty of Sultan Sher Shah, the upheavals, usual and inevitable in every Muslim regime, took place and after 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 377 
violent rebellions and bloodshed Mohammed Adilshah was 
•at last installed as the Emperor**. 
934. This Mohammed Adilshah had entrusted his 
administration to an able Hindu Vazir named Hemoo. 
H!emoo, too, without ever endangering his Hindu religion in 
the least appropriated the de facto power of the Sultan to 
himself and ruled his dominions efficiently**. 
935. But this roused the jealousy and anger of other 
JMuslim sirdars. In the meanwhile in 1542 while he was yet 
in exile Humayun had a son, named Akbar, who was later on 
•destined to be a great emperor. With the help of the Shah 
•of Iran (Persia) Humayun invaded India, and burning the 
eyes of his faithless brother and inflicting exemplary punish­ 
ments on other enemies he reconquered Delhi. But soon 
after his regaining the throne of Delhi he slipped over the 
•marble staircase of his palace and died in 1556, giving rise to 
anarchy everywhere. The last emperor of the Sur dynasty, 
Emperor Mohammed Shah Adil, who was defeated by 
Bumayun had fled to the north-west frontier. But his able 
minister, Hemoo, however, lingered on in Delhi itself trying 
to avail himself of that opportunity. 
936. A very scanty reference has been made in the 
lyiuslim historical writings about the past or future life of 
Hemoo, the valiant Hindu leader. A Hindu historian was an 
impossibility at that time and whoever tried his hand later 
•on at writing history has not said anything independently 
about Hemoo. But we have already shown in Chapter 
"Seventeen about Hindu Emperor Dharmarakshak (Nasir-ud- 
din) that his actual heroic deed is far more important and 
reliable a proof than any written record. Similarly, we shall 
try to give here the account of the Hindu Hero, Hemoo, as 
far as we can do so with the same unassailable logic. 
937. It is to be noted that even while he aspired to 
form a Hindu Empire, he received help from many Afghan 
sirdars who had fallen foul of the Moghal Muslims*' and 
•especially of the Babar faction. 
938. It is obvious that the life and career of the 
378 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN fflSTORy 
earlier Hindu Emperor, Shree Dharmarakshak (Nasir-ud- din), must have served as an ideal to be followed before Hemoo as regards the original inspiration to found a Hindu empire and the formation of a detailed scheme of his war of independence was concerned. An undying fire of freedom which sought to overthrow the Muslim rule and found a Hindu Empire in its stead had once inspired Shree Dharma­ rakshak (Nasir-ud-din) to bring about a glorious yet unsuccessful military coup, spurred Rana Sang and other Rajput warriors to cross swords, although not successfully, with Babar at Kanvah and at hundreds of places earlier and later, had stimulated millions of Hindu men and women to undergo all extremeties of fortunes, to fight horrible battles or to immolate their lives to save their religion. The same blazing fire of freedom glowed clear and bright in the Hindu heart of Hemoo, the ambitious Hindu leader. 
938-A. As has been said above he secretly prepared for- a decisive battle, organized the Muslim dissentients against the Moghals and the Hindu army and marched against Delhi^'. All the Hindu-Muslim officers at Delhi had served under him when he was the Chief Minister (Vazir). There,, other politicians and the Hindus in general offered him no opposition worth the name, surrendering to his once dreaded influence as a Vazir. His conquest of Delhi, the chief capital of Moghal empire, caused a great commotion everywhere. 
939. Hemoo was born a staunch Hindu. During the Sultan's regime he rose to political eminence by sheer dint of his merit without the slightest slur on his Hindu individua­ lity. In the end, assuming responsibility as the weak Sultan's Vazir, he began to control the whole imperial administration,, and consolidate power into his own hands. And now he had openly hoisted the standard of Hinduism ! boosted up a. Hindu imperial power trampling down the whole of the Muslim Sultanate I Quite naturally the whole of the Muslim world was rocked to the bottom with the cry that Islam was. doomed and that kafiirs flourished ! 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 379 
940. Immediately after capturing Delhi he publicly 
ascended the imperial throne as a Hindu emperor with all 
the adequate pomp and glory and assumed the title of 
Vikramaditya for himself**. Then after stabilizing and 
introducing efiicient management of the affairs of his state 
he started new conquests. Formerly as the Sultan's Vazir 
he had won fifteen to sixteen battles crushing down the 
revolts of the Muslim and other chieftains**. As such he had 
a great self-confidence in his abilities as regards the efficient 
conduct of war was concerned. At the first stroke he stormed 
and seized the second great Moghal fort of Agra**, which was 
considered to be impregnable, and the city around it. 
941. At this time the future emperor, Akbar, was a 
mere lad of thirteen or fourteen years. His Vazir, Bahiram- 
khan, was his guardian and the de facto head of his 
administration. On hearing the news of Hemoo, he at once 
resolved to crush down this bold rising of the Hindus. But 
right from Rajputana to the Deccan numerous Hindu- 
Muslim states, both big and small, had risen in revolt against 
this newly formed Moghal empire. Hence the other Muslim 
sirdars advised Bahiramkhan to put these down first and to 
keep young Akbar at Kabul in safety. But the discreet 
Bahiramkhan firmly asserted that Hemoo's rising in the name 
of a Hindu empire had to be put down firmly. Accordingly 
Bahiramkhan marched on Hemoo at the head of a power­ 
ful army, and instead of sending young Akbar to Kabul he 
took him along to the battle-field. The armies of Bahiramkhan 
and Hemoo met near Panipat. Vikramaditya Hemoo's warriors 
fought with exceptional bravery and skill. It seemed for a time 
that Hemoo had won the battle, but as ill-luck would have it, 
in the very hour of glory Vikramaditya Hemoo was struck in 
the eye by a stray arrow*^, from the army of Bahiramkhan 
and he fell from his elephant unconscious ! This created a 
havoc in the Hindu ranks of Hemoo, while the Muslim 
soldiers in Bahiramkhan's army being quite mercenary were in 
a way let loose. With a determined attack Bahiramkhan 
made this confusion worse confounded and vanquishing the 380 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
leaderless Hindn army, captured Hemoo alive'^. Taking him to young emperor Akbar Bahiramkhan requested the latter to 
•behead Hemoo with his own royal hands. But young Akbar 
•could not bring himself up to do such a cruel deed. So the enraged Bahiramkhan himself _ unsheathed his sword and cut off Hemoo's head'*. 
942. This martyrdom that Vikramaditya Hemoo cour­ ted was as obviously (manifestly) done in the cause of Hindu leligion, and the greater glory of the Hindu nation and Hindu welfare as any other. The Hindu nation must always bow down its head in all reverence to this hero, who un­ fortunately is not so remembered amongst the very few so- called martyrs and warriors in the Hindu world. Well, be it so ! But even if the millions of these self-deceived and ungrateful Hindus have forgotten him, the Hindu nation as a whole must always remember that the undying Hindu aspi­ ration to free itself which was kept continually ablaze through a succession of generations and over centuries to­ gether and which ultimately rent to pieces the Muslim imperial power, planting on its dead remains the glorious banner of an Indi^-wide Hindu empire, was fed on the now forgotten martyrdom, and the sacrificial offerings of their lives on the altar of war, of the numerous brave heroes like Hemoo, who were fatwff^ "l^fate^: (ambitious of being the lords of Delhi). 
943. Here itself may we offer our reverential tributes to the glorious memory of Vikramaditya Hemoo, the great J and proceed further ! 
THE VALIANT QUEEN DURGAWATI 
944. Bahiramkhan, thereafter, took Akbar straight to Delhi; later they two together reduced all the rebels upto 
•Gwalior (Gwalher). But they soon fell out and Akbar assumed 
•supreme authority, whereupon Bahiramkhan rebelled, but was defeated'*. Even then Akbar did not kill him out­ right, but sent him away to Makka. Bahiramkhan, however, fell a prey to a revengeful enemy of his of the earlier days'^. 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 381 
945. In A.D. 1564 the independent Rajput King in 
Gondwana, named Veer Narayan, was attacked by Akbar'*. 
King Veer Narayan was a minor. Yet his mother, the dowa­ 
ger Queen Durgawati, decided not to surrender but to fight 
the well-equipped imperial army of Akbar, and offered 
such a tough resistance that for a while the invaders were 
astounded. She bravely defended the cause of Hinduism till 
she was overwhelmed by the vastly superior numbers of the 
Muslim emperor. But did she sue for peace and lay down 
arms ? Did she ask for the imperial clemency as for a power­ 
less woman ? Or, did she send a 'Rakhi' to Akbar and 
abjectly request him to treat her as a sister and show mercy 
to her as did some other Rajput ladies off and on ? No, not 
at all ! Knowing full well from hundreds of such cases how 
these Muslim wolves ill-treated and molested the royal Hindu 
ladies who fell captives in their hands. Rani Durgawati 
staunchly refused to do anything of the kind. She, on the 
contrary, offered her body, along with many other ladies of 
the court, to the 'sacred' fire of the battle. She left strict 
orders to her attendant to burn her dead body and not to let 
the Muslim infidels touch it". Even after her death Raja 
Veer Narayan continued to fight with the Muslims, but his 
resistance was put down by the vastly superior Muslim, 
forces and in A.D. 1562 his small state of Gondwana was 
annexed to the Moghal empire". 
946. Akbar then began to entice the softer ones of the 
Rajput rulers, who had been disgusted with incessant warfare 
with the Muslims over generations together, with very allur­ 
ing promises of honourable and friendly treatment to the 
Hindus. But on seeing that, even when these docile Rajput 
rulers were prone to accept Akbar's terms, they often 
hesitated and fought shy of doing so in the face of the high 
sense of honour and pride in their religious and racial purity 
which made the belligerent Rana of Chitod staunchly turn 
down all overtures of peace from the Moghal Emperor, Akbar 
decided to subdue the fort of Chitod first and accordingly 
laid siege to it in A.D. 1567". The Rana of Chitod at that 
382 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
time was Uday Singh, who had not even a small percentage of the dauntless valour of his celebrated father, Rana Sang, who had earlier fought with Babar. But the one courtesan who was at that time wielding real power in Chitod inspired the Rajputs to extraordinary valour*". Even when Uday Singh fled away to the forest, the great feudatory lords of 
•Chitod like Jaymalla, Patta and others continued to flight with the Moghals". Later when Jaymalla and Patta were killed on the battle-field and defeat was absolutely certain, the Rajput Hindus of Chitod instead of becoming dispirited and dis-heartened were touched to the quick and infuriated to the extreme. A l l the soldiers desperately entered the battle-field and with the war-cry' Har, Har Mahadev' heaped up mounds of the massacred Muslim warriors. But ultimate­ ly when the Rajputs themselves were almost killed in the battle, all the Rajput ladies of Chitod set ablaze the big fire which was kept ready for the purpose and leapt therein from the ramparts of the fort according to their age-long glorious tradition, with small children at their breasts and the acclamations in praise of their religion on their lips. These brave ladies reduced themselves to ashes but did not allow the hateful Muslim-touch to defile their pure bodies ! This was the third great self-immolation by the ladies of Chitod**. 
947. It was the same heartless Akbar who caused such a great havoc amongst the Hindus, but whom the spineless Hindu historians of today call the most liberal of monarchs; the one, they say, who yearned to bring about amity between, and unity of, the Hindus and the Muslims ; the one, in their opinion, who treated the Hindus far more honourably than any Muslim ruler before or after him ; who was, according to them, a veritable Raja Ramchandra amongst the Muslims ! 948. But let it also be remembered that, as if not con­ tent this blood-curdling sacrifice of men, women and children of Chitod, Akbar entered the blood-stained city of Chitod, put to sword every one of the bewailing Hindu citizens that remained there**—and mark well I he made no exception for 
Sxia dLORidus EPOCH 383 
the Hindu women. Thirty thousand Hindus lost their lives 
in this one battle of Chitod. Eventually it seems the stores 
and other inanimate objects, of Chitod appeared to him as 
deadly enemies of the Muslims as the Hindus there, and 
hence this devilish destroyer Akbar went on pulling down 
the Hindu temples, prayer halls, palaces, houses—everything 
that came his way and reduced them all to heaps of rubble 
and ashes**. The temple of the presiding Goddess of Chitod 
likewise was rased to the ground, the idol of the Goddess 
and all the courtyard being completely destroyed. The 
beating drums, the fifes, the lamps, jewellery and ornaments, 
door frames and every sort of valuable or grand articles of 
Hindu interest were sent away to Agra. Only after quench­ 
ing his fiendish fanaticism a little with such an inhuman 
•destruction of the Hindu capital of Chitod did this Muslim 
Emperor Akbar return to Delhi calling himself 'Gazi' for this 
virtuous and pious act of his. 
949. On the other hand, Uday Singh, who was wander­ 
ing in the forest for four years unable to avenge the brutal 
•destruction of his kingdom and the capital city of Chitod, 
died of grief in A.D. 1572*'. 
RANA PRATAP SINGH, THE JEWEL AMONG 
THE HINDUS 
950. Uday Singh's son, Rana Pratap Singh, immediately 
ascended the non-existent, imaginary throne of Chitod ! But, 
•as he was offered the truly great throne in the hearts of all 
the staunch Rajputs and as he was considered the very 
emblem of their invincible courage and valour, this Rana 
Pratap Singh shone with more dazzling glory than many 
enthroned kings. He turned out to be the one such Rajput 
•Rana, who would never, under any odds—even at the peril 
of his life—leave the traditional high sense of honour of the 
Rajputs. Instead of seeking the humiliating friendship with 
Akbar and the moments of peace and ease that it would have 
•offered he preferred to be the direst enemy of the most power­ 
ful of Muslim Emperors, regardless of untold miseries and 
384 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY:, 
calamities that such an enmity devolved on him. ,He^ 
considered it to be the hall-mark of true Hinduism and true- 
Hindu kingship to do so ? 
951. As Chitod was in the hands of the Muslims he kept, 
his capital moving with him through villages and towns,, 
in those perilous times, and gradually rescued a large portion 
of his lost kingdom*'. He also formed a staunch army of 
desperate but devoted followers who held their lives at 
naught. It is a pity that we cannot describe his thrilling, 
exploits and pitched battles here for want of space. 
952. In the end his influence grew so powerful and sO' 
widespread that Akbar himself had to send his imperial army 
to subdue him. Shameful as it is. Raja Mansingh of Jaypur 
who had surrendered himself to Akbar and the Rajput con­ 
vert Mahabatkhan committed an unpatriotic act of joining 
Prince Salim's army marching against Rana Pratap at the 
Emperor's orders*'. And at this time it was that the celebra­ 
ted battle of Haldighat was fought. In the heat of fighting 
Rana Pratap rode his horse straight at the elephant of Prince 
Salim and that unrivalled horse, Chetak, without the slightest 
hesitation, made straight at the trunk of the Prince's, 
elephant and planted his front feet on it. With lightning 
speed Rana Pratap's spear whizzed past Prince Salim's throat 
so dreadfully as to stun the latter for a moment. But seeing 
that his dart missed the mark Rana Pratap retreated with 
equal speed and got mixed up with the army the very next, 
moment, and was not to be singled out**. 
953. Soon he retreated from this undecided battle with 
thousands of dare-devils for his faithful followers, who were 
sworn to his cause and captivated by his valour and carried 
the swift guerrilla warfare throughout Mewad destroying the 
Muslims and freeing the whole of Mewad except for the- 
capital city of Chitod. In the end Rana Pratap stabilized, 
his moving capital at Udepur, which never till the end fell 
to Akbar. The latter dropped peace-feelers, but Rana Pratap. 
never paid any heed to them. His regime is so replete with 
chivalrous and romantic adventures, deeds of exceptional 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 385 
valour done by common folks, as those by the great warriors and the Rana himself, that our young generation should delve deep into them and learn them by rote as reverentially as they would the stories from Ramayan and Mahabharat. Fortunately the romantic Rassos of Rajput Bhats upto the date of the great poet Bhooshan are still available, which should really be appointed in the secondary schools as com­ pulsory text-books. But alas ! in this critical historical survey of ours there is no place for citing any passages from them. 
954-955. NOT now in the fading light of my last days 
is any time left for them ! 
This Rana Pratap Singh, a great ornament to the Hindu society, died in A.D. 1581". 
THE RISE OF THE SIKHS IN THE PUNJAB A NEW AWAKENING OF THE HINDU MIGHT 
956. A saintly person, by name Guru Nanak, started a new religious sect in the Punjab by the end of the fifteenth century, the followers of which soon organized themselves into a homogeneous group calling themselves Shikh [Sikh— ^izjBO—ffjie disciples of Guru Nanak.] Shree Guru Nanak was not a sanyasi—a recluse—but a man with a family to bring up. He preached that the worship of God and the service of humanity was possible through devotion. 'Every man can follow this path of devotion !' he asserted*^. 
956-A. At that time not only in the Punjab but throughout the whole of India the Muslims had waged a total war against Hinduism and resounded the whole country with the clash of swords, twang of the arrows and the beat of drums. But throughout the whole of India Hindu rulers and the Hindu populace had been bravely resisting the Muslim aggression on every battlefield. Allauddin's almost completed India-wide conquest and the consequent Muslim empire was precipitately broken into numerous fragments and 
386 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
free and strong Hindu States like the Vijaynagar empire had already been established. In Eajputana and Gondwana, too, the Hindu kings with their daring armies had frequently worsted the Muslim forces ! 
957. But in the Punjab alone there was left no Hindu strong enough to challenge the Muslim government. At such a dark hour 
SHREE GURU NANAK began to preach in the Punjab that from the point of view of Ood both the Hindus and the Muslims were the same. Both the communities could attain bliss through his path of devotion. Both the communities were one common fraternity. In his sect, he said, he did not recognize any distinction between the two. Yet with all his preaching of this common accord, very few Muslims could be found amongst his disciples. All the others were Hindus. Shree Guru Nanak himself was a Khatri**. He died in 1538. Although he had sons of his own they did not follow his tenets. So he installed his disciple Angad as the chief priest after himself. This sect of Shree Guru Nanak, however, was at least upto his death nothing more than a mere devotional group, a sing­ ing choir of devotional songs and mattered very little politically. Still his grief at the miserable plight of the Hindus found echoes in some of his writings. Por example : 
958. ^rf^r^rf ft sr^ir ^ i 
rft^r % <T|^, "TSTffy ^sfm ii*' 
The Kshatriyas have left their religious duties (of protecting t h e l a n d ) , a s t h e M u s l i m s h a v e flourished. T h e w h o l e universe has taken on itself one colour, and religion is in danger; people have begun to wear blue garments and so the Turks and Pathans have become rulers. 
959. Many other similar lines ascribed to him have been very popular. Like all other Hindu saints he also has condemned many blind superstitions and foolish customs. 
: 960. After Guru Angad the third was Guru Amardas (A.D. 1574) and the fourth Guru was Ramdas. It is said he 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 387 
had an interview with Akbar, and the emperor is said to 
have bequeathed a large tract of land to him^*. On the 
same land Guru Ramdas dug out a beautiful lake and built 
a temple on its bank, which is now known as 'Amritsar'. 
<5uru Ramdas died in A . D . 1681. The fifth Guru was 
Arjunmal in whose times Sikhism grew rapidly, for they now 
had a central rendezvous at Amritsar. Moreover, the grow­ 
ing need of a religious text for this growing sect was satisfied 
by him by collecting whatever sayings of Guru Nanak he 
•could get hold of along with those of other contemporary 
saints and thereby creating an authorized religious book for 
the Sikhs ! This very authorized religious text-book was called 
by him 'Gurugranth' or 'Adigranth'^^. In it are to be found 
the sayings of Kabir as also those of the Maharashtrian 
saint, Namdev. While the Maharashtrian saint, Namdev, was 
on a pilgrimage of the Punjab his teaching of the path of 
•devotion (»if^ and his 'Abhangs' (hymns) had a wide­ 
spread influence there. The striking similarity between his 
teachings and those of Guru Nanak prompted the inclusion of 
some of Sant Namdev's Marathi poems in this 'Gurugranth'^*. 
This Gurugranth is in Prakrut which is now called in the 
Punjab as Punjabi. It was not written in the Devnagri 
script which was then called 'Shastri Lipi' as it was mostly 
employed by the learned 'Pandits for writing about scientific 
topics. Just as for ordinary day-to-day affairs 'Modi' script 
was employed in Maharashtra till very recently, similarly 
in the Punjab at that time in general correspondence of the 
common people a Prakrut script, was employed and it served 
for this 'Adigranth'. The script was commonly called 'Lundi- 
mundi'. But after the Gurugranth bad been written in it the 
Sikhs began to call it Gurumukhi'' as it was adopted by their 
Gurus ! 
961. When Jahangir became the emperor his eldest son, 
Khushru, rebelled against him, and fled to the Punjab. As 
the Sikh Guru Arjundev gave him shelter, the enraged 
Jahangir captured the Sikh Guru and slew him^^, in the 
Sikh history Guru Arjun was. the first heroic martyr who 
388 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
laid down his life while fighting with the Muslims in the: cause of his religion. In the days of this very Arjundev a: separate organization was set afoot and a tradition of com­ pulsory religious tax to be paid to the Guru by every Sikh was established**, and in order that Sikh sect might grow* powerful a military front was also initiated*". 
962. The violent death of Guru Arjun secretly rankled in the hearts of the Sikhs giving rise to inveterate hatred for the Muslims. Most of the Sikhian followers in. those times, as also later on, were Hindu Jats by caste. A» these Hindu Jats were the main support of the Sikh sect- and that too, quite strong, the Punjabi Hindus in general had affection for, and a feeling of oneness with, them. The militant tendencies and the military organizations began to grow amongst the Sikhs and as a sect of the Hindus, they happened to be staunch defenders of Hinduism against the increasing ferocity of the Muslim religious persecution. So. the Moghal government began to look upon that sect as a, troublesome centre of Hindu resistance**. 
963. Soon the son of Guru Arjun, Guru Hargovind! refused to pay taxes to the emperor*^. He was, therefore^ captured and interned in prison for twelve years**. Later on when he was released from captivity he rebelled against, the then Moghal emperor, Shahjahan, who dispatched a small detachment to crush this apparently meagre opposition. But at Sangram the Sikhs fought with such fierceness that- the Muslim detachment was completely vanquished**.. Although this astounded and |ple.ased the Hindus in the Punjab the Emperor did not mind it. Guru Hargovindi died in A.D. 1645** and was succeeded by Harrai, Har- kishan and Tej Bahadur as the high priests of the Sikhs. But it is the exceptional and glorious sacrifice of TeJ Bahadur in the cause of religion that has given dignity and, splendour to the seat of the high priest of the Sikhs. 
963-A. Guru Tej Bahadur lived at Anandpur. When­ ever the atrocious conversions of the Hindus to Islam took place in the Punjab, Guru Tej Bahadur, with his Sikh, 
•6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 389 
•warriors, had often fought and opposed them fiercely**. And 
then Aurangzeb, the veritable demon in human form, vowed 
to root out the whole Hindu world. Naturally, throughout 
the whole of India the Hindus, too, opposed him violently. 
Aurangzeb particularly aimed at the top-ranking Brahmins 
•of Kashmir*', and enforced on them the Jizia tax if they did 
not opt for conversion. This caused a great commotion 
everywhere. At this time Guru Tej Bahadur told the Hindus 
^boldly not to pay any such taxes** and preached that they 
should sacrifice their lives rather than forsake their religion. 
When the Hindus began to give such bold replies Aurangzeb 
was aflame with rage. He captured Guru Tej Bahadur and 
commanded him to court Islam on pain of death. Guru Tej 
Bahadur thereupon staunchly refused to be a Muslim and 
•defied Aurangzeb, who immediately had him beheaded**. 
This horrible tragedy took place in A.D. 1675. Along with 
•Guru Tej Bahadur several of his Hindu disciples also were 
caught and they all suffered horrible deaths after all sorts 
•of atrocities and torments, but defied the tyrannical Muslim 
•emperor by boldly refusing to be Muslims. The heads of 
some of the prominent Hindus were actually cut asunder 
with a big saw. Among these martyrs was Bhai MatidasTM, 
whose family was lovingly given the title 'Bhai' by the Sikh 
<3rurus and in this very family was born the latter day Hindu 
patriot, Bhai Parmanand. The son of this very brave Guru 
was the holiest of the holies, the Hindu national hero, Shree 
<3uru Govindsing'i ! 
THE HINDU NATIONAL HERO—SHREE GURU GOVINDSING 
964. To Shree Guru Govindsing goes all the credit of 
militarizing Sikhism and to create out of that sect a militant 
and invincible organization which gave a strong impetus to 
the establishment of a strong and independent Hindu 
government in the Punjab at the time of Maharaja Eanjitsing. 
He was called Tenth Emperor—^Wf'^—because he was 
the tenth guru from Shree Guru Nanak, not only by the Sikhs 390 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
but even by all the Punjabi Hindus. From innumerable daring and thrilling events in his life, which well illustrate the above remark, only one might suflSce here][for want of space for others ! 
965. As inevitably happens in the case of every big religious organization Guru Nanak's disciples also came to be divided into many sections and sub-sections, but they were all living a Hindu way of life. In respect of marriages- and other religious rites and social customs they were not in any way separated from the Hindu society. In the 'Gurugranth' itself the sayings of Hindu saints like Sant Namdev and Kabir were incorporated along with those of Guru Nanak himself. And from the beginning till this day that 'Adigranth' has always been read with equal reverence for all these sayings. But a son of Guru Nanak himself had started a separate branch of Sikhism. 
965-A. In course of time when the Hindus and Sikhs began to be atrociously persecuted by the Muslims, it was felt that an armed force of the Sikhs for self-protection was absolutely necessary, and Guru Govindsing began to dream of establishing an independent kingdom of the Sikhs'*. To that end he wanted a band of dare-devils of inviolable loyalty to their Guru. 
966. Guru Govindsing, therefore, called a big assembly of all the Sikhs, Such incidents in his life have been described a little later in poetical compositions much on the same lines as the colourful descriptions of the Hindu Puranas'*. But we shall give here only the historically relevant part of it. 
967. In that big assembly Guru Govindsing invited volunteers who were prepared to even lay down their lives in the defence of their religion and willing to spend their whole lives in the army, take it up as their profession, for, he said, he had to build a standing army of the Sikhs'^. It was a very austere vow. Of the many, who thus volunteered; the Guru himself chose for the first time only the best five who were expected to be as sharp and as unbending as steeh

6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 391 
To imbibe this principle on their minds the first religious rite 
that was performed was the sprinkling on their heads of the 
holy water which was churned by a sharp steel sword as the 
mantras were chanted. Then it was enjoined upon them 
that they were always to have a sword fastened to their 
waist; they were never to cut the hair on any part of their 
body. They were asked ever to gird up their loins, to wear 
kaccha or langot—a loin-cloth, and to wear steel rings round 
their wrists as a mark of their stern military vow. A comb 
was also considered to be a must for evey Sikh. Thus hair 
Kesh) a comb ( ^n-^T^T Kangha ), a loin-cloth (^=5gf-5fjTte 
Kaocha), a steel ring (^^i Kara) and a sword ( gqpir Kripan) 
became the five inseparable marks of every true Sikh, and 
were called 'five kakkas'*. The military wing of the Sikhs, 
specially chosen by the Guru has since then been called the 
'Khalsa', which has become an honourable appellation 
throughout the whole of India. Khalsa is originally an 
Urdu word meaning 'chosen'" ! 
968. As soon as this 'Khalsa' army reached a desired 
magnitude Guru Govindsing began to conquer smaller Hindu- 
Muslim States or to sack them. Quite naturally the Moghal 
Emperor, Aurangzeb, who had most brutally murdered his 
father, Tej Bahadur, for not renouncing his religion, sent 
a detachment of his army's capture Guru Govindsing. 
Because of the actions that were fought with the Moghal 
army the Guru enclosed himself in the fort of Anandpur, which 
was immediately invested by the Moghals'®. Amongst the 
soldiers fighting with Guru Govindsing from the fort were two 
of his sons below the age of eighteen. In order to boost up 
the courage of the army the Guru sent his two sons with 
other soldiers out of the fort to fight with the Moghals. 
While these two sons were being done to death in this 
unequal battle this strange father was crying words of 
approbation 'Wah-wa ! Wah-wa i^o. At night-fall the 
fighting stopped as a matter of course and the remnant of the 
Khalsa battalion entered the fort very stealthily. But of that 
Khalsa (chosen) soldiers many had lost hope. So the Guru 
=392 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
plainly told tliem all that those who wanted to save their 
lives should leave the Khalsa army and forsake him immedi­ 
ately. He, however, was determined to fight on from inside 
or, if necessary, out of the fort. Thereupon from the best 
chosen (the Khalsa) many Sikh warriors resigned their 
membership and deserted.Guru Govindsing^^. Soon on that 
dark and dismal night Guru Govindsing bade adieu to those 
who remained of his Khalsa army and escaped through the 
Moghal siege, along with his wife and two sons, who were 
under twelve*''. 
969. While after leaving the fort Guru Govindsing was 
thus wandering through the forest on that fateful night, he 
lost track of his two tender children^*, who unfortunately 
fell in the enemy hands. Those wicked monsters gave the 
young kiddies an ultimatum "Forsake Hinduism and become 
Muslims, or else we will kill you with all sorts of tortures** !" 
Prompt came the reply from the young mouths, thunderring 
dauntlessly—lion's cubs as they were—"We are prepared 
to die for our religion*^ !" They had refused to forsake 
their Hindu religion. Highly enraged at this defiant reply 
the Muslim authorities pronouned their direst sentence. 
Building a wall round them to suffocate the two children to 
death was the horrible punishment given**. Straight stood 
the two tender children and brick upon brick rose to their 
very neck, when they were again asked, "You kafirs, don't 
you forsake your Hindu religion even now ?" "No, no never !" 
came the smothered voice ! And even as the two kids 
were shouting slogans in praise of Hinduism as loudly as 
they [could in that horrible position, the last bricks were 
laid to bury them for ever*'. 
970. This is truly a glorious incident of martyrdom 
for the sake of Hinduism that has to be honourably listed 
amongst others in the annals of Hindu nation. It is a 
true historical fact but is to be found only described in the 
poetical form. 
971. Kumar Haqiqatrai— At this very time a Hindu 
lad, by name Kumar Haqiqatrai, happened to draw a 
•6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 393 
picture of the Hindu Goddess of Learning, Saraswati, on his 
slate for worshipping it. But for this very atrocious deed (!) 
the Muslim officers there sentenced him to be converted 
to Islam**. On his refusal to do so he was threatened with a 
horrible death. When he defied that threat too, he was killed 
forthwith**. The Hindus of the Punjab even today celebrate 
his memory every year as a religious and auspicious 
occasion*". 
972. The End of Guru Govindsing—After the horri­ 
ble death of his two sons Guru Govindsing sent from his 
«xile a conciliatory letter to Aurangzeb as a strategic move 
in politics*^. The Emperor, too, sent a reply, and after a 
certain mutual agreement Guru Govindsing was allowed to 
leave the Punjab. Guru Govindsing thereafter came wander­ 
ing to Maharashtra and settled at Nanded*^. Here it was 
that two Pathan disciples of his conspired and attacked 
bim while he was soundly sleeping*'. The wounds that he 
received in that struggle proved fatal and soon he died. 
973. Guru Govindsing had passed his boyhood days, not 
in the Punjab but in Patna in Bihar**, for reasons of safety. 
As such he grew fond of the Bihar Hindi language, in which, 
later on, he became well-versed. His autobiography 'Vichitra 
Natak' is written in the Bihari Hindi, not in the 'Guru- 
mukhi' Punjabi. He also composed a heroic poem on 
the Goddess, 'Chandika'. He symbolised the sword as 
•Goddess 'Chandika' herself and has written a hymnal song 
on it. We have already cited some of its warlike passages 
in our other books under the caption 'Jay Tegam' (Jay 
Khadgam). As the writings of this tenth Sikh Guru, Guru 
Govindsing, are in Hindi, and the duties he had enjoined on 
the Khalsa sect were not so very palatable to the traditional 
devotees of Guru Nanak, they did not find a place in the 
^Adigranth', whereas the sayings of all the former nine Gurus 
were included in it. So the writings of Guru Govindsing were 
collected|in the so-called 'Dasham Granth' {^^^ jjsr) the tenth 
1)ook. 974. Another fact which is important from the point of 
394 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
view of the Hindus must be mentioned here. Because of the 
creation of the Khalsa sect there have been two divisions 
amongst the Sikhs : Sahajdhari and Keshdhari. The Sahaj- 
dharis follow the path of Guru Nanak. They don't allow the 
hair to grow uncut, nor are they particular about following the 
other 'kakkas'. Thousands of such Hindu Sikhs fall under 
this Sahajdhari sect. But it must be remembered that it was 
Shree Govindsing who, by giving them a martial garb, built 
the Sikhs into a virile sub-Hindu nation, which could 
ultimately oust the Muslim rule from the Punjab at the point 
of the sword. 
975. Shree Veer Banda Bairagi—The name which can 
never be omitted from the list of the brave martyrs of Hindu 
history is that of Veer Banda Bairagi who for the first time 
avenged the wrongs done by the Muslims on the Hindus and 
even boldly attacked them. He was originally a Vaishnav 
saint*^ known round about Nanded, where he happened to 
meet Guru Govindsing*^ from whom he gradually learnt of the 
miserable plight of the Hindus in the Punjab, of the harrow­ 
ing calamities that befell Guru Govindsing's own family and 
of the relentless war he himself had carried out in spite of all 
odds. He was particularly much moved to hear the despair­ 
ing complaint of the Guru that there was nobody left in the 
Punjab to avenge the tragic deaths of his four sons. His. 
blood began to boil and he once again took the bow and 
arrows of his former vocation in life. Guru Govindsing wrote 
a note to all his former disciples to render Veer Banda every 
possible help. Taking that note and vowing terrible revenge 
upon the Muslims for the inhuman atrocities committed by 
them on the Hindus, this brave Hindu soul made his way to- 
the Punjab*'. 
976. But alas ! want of space and my own old age 
makes it imperative that whatever is written so far should be 
somehow rounded up. Else I would certainly have described, 
if not in full, at least briefly the havoc Veer Baba Banda 
wrought amongst the Muslims of the Punjab, their grand 
slaughter**, the most appropriate retaliation of the molesta- 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 395 
tion of the Hindu women, the capture of the same Sirhind, 
where Guru Govindsing's two sons were buried alive behind 
the brick-walls, and the eventual burning of the Muslim 
locality there'*, not to speak of the abject parade of Muslim 
men, women and children, barefooted, in the hot sun"", the 
same atrocious tortures of the Muslims as were visited upon 
the Hindus for not renouncing Hinduism and finally the 
proclamation of a Hindu State in the whole of the Punjab^"!. 
We have already shown in the sixth chapter of this book 
how the Muslim community was panic-stricken whenever the 
Hindus opened up religious aggression on the Muslims. Baba 
Banda also struck terror in the hearts of the Punjabi 
Muslims by his retaliatory aggression. At last the Emperor 
of Delhi sent a big army to the Punjab"^. Resorting to the 
guerrilla warfare Baba Banda defeated it at various places. 
But as ill-luck would have it, the Khalsa Sikhs began to be 
jealous of the epithet "Hindu commander" which Baba 
Banda Bairagi had chosen for himself^'*. Ultimately that 
jealousy grew to such an extent that the united Hindu army 
of Veer Banda broke into two factions, and the one consisting 
of the Khalsa Sikhs deserted him. The Khalsa Sikh faction 
was by itself not able to conquer the Muslims. Naturally the 
Moghal army grew stronger and in a desperate action valiant 
Banda Bairagi fell into the Muslim hands with his only son 
and close followers"*. The Muslims were haunted by a false 
fear that Veer Banda possessed some magic power, and the 
higher Muslim of&cials, too, feared that even when he was 
bound hand and foot with strong iron fetters, Veer Banda 
Baba would transform himself into a cat and would escape 
through the ranks of a powerful army. So he was sent to 
Delhi locked in a strong cage, like a wild beast, along 
with many other captive Hindu warriors"". What a horrible 
scene it was when he was brought in the presence of the 
Emperor ! ! How hellishly inhuman the torture of Veer 
Banda, his only son and his hundred or so Hindu followers, 
and the streams of blood that flowed ! !. Veer Banda was 
not beheaded or killed straightaway. He was pierced scores 
396 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
of times with red-hot iron bars and lumps of his flesh were 
cut out every time with a view to make him suffer extreme 
torture before he died"*—^But there is no scope to describe 
this harrowing scene here. But every true and grateful 
Hindu should rather read it from the books written by the 
Sikhs and Muslim writers themselves. 
977. The History of the Sikhs Written by me— I am 
very sad that I cannot refer the reader to the History of the 
Sikhs, I had written years ago. It is necessary that the 
reason be explained here. Round about the year 1909 in the 
thick of the revolutionary activities, when I happened to go 
from England to France, I stayed for a month or so with 
Madam Kama. During that short period I wrote out in 
Marathi the thrilling history of the Sikhs"', running to about 
two hundred pages or so, based on the proven material I had 
at my disposal at the time. I had studied almost all the Sikh 
literature right from the first book in Sikh literature, named 
^Bhai Balaki Janamsakhi'—the lifestory of Guru Nanak writ­ 
ten by his disciple 'Bhai Bala'—to the tenth book—Dasham- 
granth—of the tenth Guru Govindsing in the original, not to 
speak of the Histories of the Sikhs sby Cunningham and other 
English writers. I had brought the account of the Sikhs 
upto the establishment of a new Hindukingdom by Maharaja 
Ranjitsing right from the river Shatadru (Sutlej) to the 
Sindhu (Indus) and much above towards Jammu and 
Kashmir by uprooting the Muslim power from the Punjab and 
avenging the defeats of Jaypal and Anangpal. But even 
today it pains me to say that the manuscript of that book 
must have very likely fallen into the English hands and 
destroyed. Else the person with whom I had entrusted it to 
be taken to India for being printed and published must have 
drowned it into the sea for fear of the search by the English 
police somewhere on his way to India. Doubtless it is that 
that Marathi book of mine has been lost before it could be 
published—has been detsroyed ! 
978. Even then whoever has a mind should read my 
poem"* composed in the Andamans on this tragic, yet impe- 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 397. 
rishable and resplendent martyrdom of Shree Veer Banda, 
which is available even now. 
979. According to the belief prevalent among his disci­ 
ples, Veer Banda's body was thrown away into the debris on 
the outskirts of the city under the impression that he was 
dead. But with his magic poM-er and some miraculous herb 
that his disciples made him eat, Veer Banda Baba came to 
his senses and he was secretly and immediately taken to the 
Punjab"*. Further on an institution grew up in his name 
and hundreds of his Sikh followers have kept it running to 
this day under the name, 'Bandai'. Like the kuka followers 
of Guru Ramsingh of a later date these 'Bandais' call 
themselves Hindus. 
980. After the tragic death of Veer Banda there was 
no armed force left either of the Khalsas, Bandais, Sahaj- 
dharis or any other Sikh or Hindu sect. Every one of them 
was disorganized and disgruntled. But on the contrary the 
Muslim political power had begun to crumble down by the 
time it was fighting with Veer Banda. Throughout the whole 
of India, a new resurgent Hindu power—the Maratha military 
and political aspiration—was dealing knock-down blows to. 
the Moghal imperial power and the latter existed only nomi­ 
nally from Delhi to the Punjab, Multan, Kashmir and 
Kandahar. Only the local ruffians terrorized the general 
populace with their bands of scoundrels ! 
981. How the Sikh power grew thereafter and how at 
last in the times of Maharaja Ranjitsing it spread through­ 
out the whole of the Punjab and Kashmir obliterating every 
vestige of the Muslim rule and how the Hindu independent 
empire came into existence—we can only just hint at here ! 
For all these events fall out of the period under discussion 
here. 982. However two or three statements about this period 
of the Punjabi History can be made here briefly, and it is 
neces.iary to do so. 
9 8 3 . T h e first s u c c e s s f u l a t t e m p t t o o v e r t h r o w t h e 
Muslim rule in the Punjab was made by the Marathas. The 
398 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
belief prevalent in the histories of the Sikhs and in the other 
loosely written history books of India that the Sikhs ousted 
the Muslim rule from the Punjab for the first time is errone­ 
ous. Even when the Sikhs were at the height of their glory 
they could not conquer the neighbouring Muslim capital, 
Delhi. In bringing this to light we do not in the least mean 
to disparage the Sikhs, but we do certainly want to stop 
every attempt at belittling the national glory of the Marathas, 
by pointing out false things. No doubt, the credit of over­ 
throwing the Muslim rule, at least, in the precincts of the 
Punjab and establishing there an independent Hindu State, 
like that of Maharaja Ranjitsing goes primarily to our Sikh 
organisation. But it is equally true, beyond any vestige of 
doubt, that the Maratha valour which, lunging, as it did, 
from Poona, fluttered the victorious and resplendent flag of 
the Hindu nation, to the South right up to Tanjawar (Tanjore) 
and to the north to the very banks of the Sindhu (Indus) 
and beyond, fighting battles after battles and reducing the 
Muslim Emperor of Delhi to a nominal existence—a thing of 
shreds and patches—can have no parallel at least in the 
Hindu history of that long period of seven centuries. 
984. The Independent Hindu State of Nepal : In our 
history books and the school text-books of Indian history 
almost every Indian region is mentioned. But strangely 
enough the state of Nepal and the valiant Hindu Kingd om 
there is never mentioned—or if at all only in passing over the 
campaigns of Ochterloney—as if Nepal is in no way connected 
with Hindu India. But in fact Nepal is as much an indivisible 
part of India as are Maharashtra, the Punjab or Madras. 
These regions might have been governed by different rulers at 
difi'erent times but the term Hindu Nation is equally applicable 
to all of them. The rest of the Indian continent was subject­ 
ed to aggressions by Asian Muslims and European Christians 
during the last nine or ten centuries and there were constant 
wars. But fortunately Nepal was singularly immune to all 
the political and religious aggressions. On the whole, in Nepal 
alone could Hindu religion and Hindu culture maintain its 5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 399 
independence unimpaired against the incursions of the 
foreigners. As such Nepal must really be considered to be 
the best part of Hindu India, and should be given the palm 
of honour in the history of our Hindu Nation ! But because 
of our thoughtlessness the result is just the reverse. Only 
because Nepal did not get lost in the mire of foreign domi­ 
nation and slavery and because it kept itself aloof from the 
political upheavals in India, our frivolous history books 
mention that nation only in passing or never at all ! 
985. In order to rectify this spineless (dishonourable) 
perversion we started a movement in India as soon as we 
were released from the Andamans in 1924 in respect of Nepal, 
as people well know. At that very time we wrote a book on 
the History of Nepal ese Movement! (^qicfV stf^tsRl^ fel^fl?f) 
and in it we gave an account of the brave history of 
Nepal and its role in the protection and maintenance of the 
independence of Hindu religion and culture. But now in this 
discourse on Hindu history paucity of space prevents any 
such detailed account—and there is no need for it. In the early 
part of the tenth century and onwards Nepal was governed 
by Newari Hindus^". Thereafter it was captured by some 
of the Rajputs who left Rajputana because of the Muslim 
aggression to seek fortune elsewhere. Gradually these Rajputs 
spread upto Kathmandu which they made their capital. The 
strong Hindu government which these Rajputs established 
there is the modern Nepal"^. This much reference is enough 
here to attract the attention of the Indian Hindus to its 
importance and to the homogeneity of race of Nepal with 
ours. 986. These Rajputs being strong worshippers and pro­ 
tectors of the Cow (jil<^) eventually came to be called Gorkha 
by caste"*. 
986-A. Although it refers to the more recent times we 
should like to make a special mention of the fact that while 
the whole of India was being governed by the English thou­ 
sands of Gorkhas (Gurkhas) had joined the English army and, 
in both the great World Wars, showed so much prowess and 
400 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
bravery and exceptional skill in fighting that even the best 
soldiers in England, America and Germany, too, were astoun­ 
ded. Hence today a Gurkha soldier has proverbially come to 
mean an excellent warrior ! 
THE LATTER HALF OF AKBAR'S LIFE 
987. It has already been shown, in Paragraphs 946 to 
954 of this book, what cruelty and atrocity Akbar resortedjto 
in order to crush Hinduism and the Hindu rulers. Even 
those passing references alone are quite sufBcient to prove 
that he was as fanatical and as fiercely inimical to Hinduism 
and the Hindu nation as was either AUauddin or Aurangzeb. 
988. European writers on Indian history slyly hint and 
our Hindu writers slavishly and thoughtlessly imitate them, 
when they say that Akbar was not like other Moghal or 
Muslim fellows meaning thereby that he did not hate 
Hinduism and the Hindu nation, that he was just and never 
differentiated between the Hindus and the Muslims, that he 
ruled equitably and as such the Hindus must be highly 
grateful to him. This eulogy of Akbar is utterly false. We, 
Hindus, can either show respect, gratitude and affection for 
Rana Pratap or for his dire enemy, Akbar. How can we show 
equal affection and respect for both of them ? How can we 
worship God and the devil at the same time ? How even can 
we compare the fanatical Akbar who deprived the indepen- 
ence of the Hindu kings like Rana Pratap and thurst the 
yoke of slavery on their necks, who demanded the Hindu 
royal princesses as queens and concubines in order to add 
insult to their injury and attacked with his vast armies 
those, who declined to do so, and crushed them completely. 
How can we compare him with those thousands of martyrs 
and valiant Hindu leaders like Rana Pratap and Rani 
Durgawati who laid down their lives on the battlefields in 
the defence of Hindu Nation, Hindu States and Hindu 
religion ? 
989. Another important point which has so far escaped 
the notice of many of our gullible and slavish Hindn writers 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 401 
is that to say that Akbar treated all his subjects equally and ' 
sponsored equality of status for the whole humanity—as is 
being taught in schools—is absolutely erroneous, and is the 
result of the bad habit of extolling the Muslims unpro- 
portionately. For, being a Moghal Emperor, he never' 
hesitated to crush down ruthlessly anyone who refused to 
bear the yoke of his sovereignty—might he then be a Muslim 
or a Hindu ! Now all the Muslims were not Moghals. As a 
matter of fact many of them hated the Moghals bitterly 
because he had extended his empire by destroying the old 
Afghan and Turkish Sultanates. It means that like any 
other ambitious adventurer Akbar fought for the sake of his 
own Moghal glory not only against the Hindus alone but 
against others also. Obviously enough he did not treat even 
the Muslims equally. He liquidated and annexed many Mus­ 
lim kingdoms. Only with a view to safeguarding the interests 
of his empire did Akbar in his later life repeal the revolting 
religious taxes like the Jizia and refrained from opening 
campaigns of mass conversion of Hindus. There was no 
such intention of behaving equitably with Hindus and the 
Muslims behind this policy, as is generally supposed"'. On 
the contrary he knew quite well that whenever such atrocities 
were committed on the Hindus, in the name of religion, by the 
former Sultans, they were followed with disastrous revolts. 
Sometimes even the whole Sultanates were consumed in the 
conflagration of the Hindu wrath. In order to avoid this 
disastrous end for his empire and to establish a tranquil 
administration of his own did he treat all his subjects whether 
they were Hindus or Muslims, justly so far as their individual 
life was concerned and much more leniently and harmlessly 
than other emperors, like AUauddin or Aurangzeb. But 
once again let it be remembered that it was not because he 
believed in the equality of man or the equality of the Hindus 
and the Muslims irrespective of their religion, certainly not 
because he did not consider the Hindus as kafirs ! 
990. Once he became the all-powerful and absolute mo­ 
narch in temporal affairs of his empire, his ambition goaded him 
402 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN'HISTORY 
on to found a new religion, to be another Paigambar and 
Jord of the spiritual life of the people ! To that end he 
thought of starting an absolutely new religion quite different 
from either Hinduism or Islam"*. But here also it must be 
remembered that as he knew it would be disastrous to force 
it cruelly on the people, as had other Muslim Sultans done 
earlier or as Aurangzeb did it later"^, Akbar very slyly tried 
to undermine Hinduism through his Din-e-lahi; for the Chief 
Paigambarship of this religion was to be ceded inevitably to 
Akbar himself. No Hindu could greet others with a 
*Namaskar", he had perforce to say "Allah-o-Akbar ! The 
accredited language, too, of this new religion 'Din-e-lahi 
w^as Arabic ! It may, however, be noted in passing that this 
•quixotic ambition (idea) of Akbar of becoming the spiritual 
lord of the human race came to nought"*. For beside the 
flattering sycophants in his court, none of the Hindus or the 
Muslims accepted it as their creed; the sycophants themselves 
had nothing to do with it the moment Akbar died. 
990-A. However, of the many great emperors that lived 
at the time in Europe or Africa or Asia, Akbar was the greatest 
in respect of his strategy, his wielding of the widest power, 
bravery, founding of a vast empire, his patronage of learning 
and arts and crafts. Although according to some writers he 
was illiterate he patronized great authors and encouraged the 
writing of famous books ! This comparative greatness 
history can concede to him, and we do not hesitate to call 
him as great as he really was. But with all that greatness 
he was, from our Hindu point of view, foreign, belonging to 
another religion and mean-minded and as such he should be 
decried by us, Hindus !

CHAPTER X X I 
C O M E T H E A V E N G E R S O F T H E A T R O C I O U S 
MUSLIMS' RULE : THE MARATHAS ! 
991. It is a common belief that the writing of history smust be a prosaic account of bare facts describing them as they have actually happened, and it is mostly right. There ought to be a marked difference between the descriptions of something that is purely imaginary and poetic and of some­ thing that has actually happened. The one can best be well expressed in a faithful and matter-of-fact way. 
991-A. Yet merely to list out the correct dates and years of historical events, to note the deaths and births of certain individuals, and to keep a record of battles fought or the 
•occurrence of famines and floods cannot be called history, although such a bare record of these various events is the basis of history. It may at best be called a chronological account. But there is a border-land between pure history and pure unalloyed poetry which can adequately and effec­ tively be expressed by a fine blending of history and poetry. Without such a blending of history and poetry descriptions of such events can never be living. While describing such events history itself becomes poetry. Such occasions and events can never be effectively described without resorting to mythological and romantic metaphors and grand poetic style. Simple events can be described as truthfully as they happen in prose. But human nature demands that every­ thing that is unique, everything that is stupendous and splendid and exciting, must be expressed in a highly emotional and ornate style, be it an event of a very recent occurrence. Simple dry prose will never be able to sustain it. It is these exciting events that make a man roar with laugh- :ter, groan with sorrow, dance wity joy or get wild with rage 
404 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
—in short exciting events make him speak the language of 
poetry ! It may be prose, but poetic prose, often bedecked 
with dazzling ornaments of simile, metaphor and other 
figures of speech, as is the prince of princes adorned with the 
real ones ! 
992. ffi'?T?f^sn^5W : 
"His grief at the destruction of the bird by the hunter 
took the form of a four-lined verse—a 
993. It is not testimony enough that the very first, 
quatrain by the very first poet should be born of a highly 
exciting sentiment which could never be conveyed in simple- 
words. 
994. Precuation, however, must be taken that the- 
poetic description of such exceptional yet exciting events 
should not pervert the original facts. A well-authenticated 
history should express itself through all this emotional 
display. 
99d. The period of Indian history, which we are now 
going to discuss in this book is from the point of view of the 
Hindu Nation so glorious, so thrilling, and so full of daring, 
events that the poetic style of writing alone can describe it. 
adequately and in a tuning manner. 
996. In the eighth Chapter of this book the Hindu- 
Muslim war which had been going on for six centuries had 
entered in the seventh. But even when such a long time of 
bitter warfare had elapsed and even when the Hindu Nation 
had been sorely plagued and profusely bled by the ferocious, 
religio-political aggressions of all the Asian Muslims—th& 
Arabs the Afghans, the Pathans, the Turks, the Moghals—yet 
even by the beginning of the seventeenth century the Hindu 
nation had, neither in the north nor in the south, been, 
completely vanquished ! Nay, it was still fighting on bravely 
on the battlefield itself, although sorely smarting under the 
countless wounds it had so far received. On the contrary 
the aggressive might of all the Asian Muslims had been 
steadily but surely getting weaker and weaker after their 
'5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 405 
incessant warfare with the Hindus right from the beginning 
•of the eighth century to the death of Akbar. We have already 
shown, in Paragraphs 818 to 857 of this book in the chapter 
named "The Beginning of the Fall of the Muslim Power", 
how that "beginning" -was made from the 14th century and 
how the ground was being prepared for the establishment 
•of the victorious Hindu Kingdoms, like that of Vijaynagar. 
997. The same resurgent spirit of the Hindus grew 
steadily every day and ultimately by the time which the 
•course of our story has now reached, the presiding deity of 
the Hindu nation seems to have felt the dire necessity, to 
use the histro-mythological phraseology, of bringing forth 
an extraordinarily illustrious Hindu family which could 
' ultimately lead the ever-growing Hindu might throughout 
the whole of India. In the old times when that deity felt 
a similar need of extirpating the Saka-Hun and other 
Mlenchhas, she performed, according to Chand Bhat in his 
epic 'The Story of Agnikula', a great sacrifice on Mount Abu 
and brought forth four Indian Hindu heroes. But unfor­ 
tunately it was not sufficient to bring forth four such 
valiant heroes to meet the exigency of the times, of which 
we are telling here, to extirpate the Muslim political power 
throughout India. A whole generation of such divinely 
blessed heroes was needed for such a stupendous task ! As 
such to use again the metaphorical style of Chand Bhat, the 
president deity of the Hindu nation glanced all over India. 
That enraged deity sprinkled her holy water on the heights 
of Sahyadri, thinking, perhaps, that that region alone was the 
fittest one for the final overthrow of the Muslim power after 
a millennial war with it. How could a small sacrificial pit at 
Abu be equal to that stupendous task ! And all of a 
sudden the whole of the Sahyadri mountain was aglow with 
the fire of war and resonant with the beat of the drum. 
And there arose a whole class, a whole generation of brave 
warriors. Each one lighted his individual torch on the 
general conflagration and traversed the M'hole o f India w i t h 
the war cry, 'Har, Har Mahadev* on his lips to wipe out the 
406 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Muslim political menace. The n^me of this national race ?• 
It is— 
' M A H A R A S H T R A B O R N O F T H E T I M E S O F S H I V A J I ' 
HINDU MAHARASHTRA ALONE FOUGHT 
W I T H T H E W H O L E M U S L I M W O R L D 
998. At this time in the millennial Hindu-Muslim epic- 
war such a great catastrophe befell the whole of India—and 
especially Maharashtra—as had menaced perhaps, a very few 
nations of the world. To add to the Muslim maelstrom from 
, the north European nations like the Portuguese, the Dutch, 
the French and the English dashed on India—and especially 
the Deccan, with an avalanchine force, and it was practically 
the lot of the Maharashtra, born out of the times of Shivaji, 
to face all alone all these terrific aggressions. Stranger 
than this is the fact that this Maharashtra, born as it was 
from the sacrificial fire of dire calamities, faced them all 
successfully, and was a match for all the enemies ! The 
Muslim imperial throne of Delhi was hacked to pieces by 
the Marathas and the Muslim power was finally rooted out 
. throughout the whole of India. 
999. The legend of this exceptional glory and valour 
of Maharashtra has now been generally known in its true 
perspective and form to the common people in Maharashtra 
at least. The credit of making it widely known in its grand 
and spectacular aspect, in its all-India context, must neces­ 
sarily go to the great research-scholars and writers of 
history like Rajwade, Ranade, Khare, Itihasacharya 
Sardesai and others. But with the exception of Ranade, 
others have written their books in Marathi. Histories of 
the Marathas written in languages other than Marathi have 
been mostly written by our age-old enemies like the Muslims,, 
the Portuguese, the English and others with horrid perver­ 
sion of facts, and unfortunately our Hindu writers from the 
other Indian States have echoed them mostly through 
ignorance. 
1000. Hence I, at least, felt, right from my student- 
.6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 40T 
days, that this post-Shivaji history of Maharashtra should 
be written in English, based on the research-work done in 
t h i s field t i l l t o d a y ; s o t h a t n o n - M a h a r a s h t r a a n d o t h e r 
foreigners might know ! But, as I had selected warfarei with 
the then enemy of our nation rather than that of the past, as 
the field of my action, I was more and more involved in the 
revolutionary activities against the British. Hence till the 
time I was released from the Andamans I had no time to 
write about the past history of Maharashtra. Again I 
thought people like Sardesai who had devoted themselves 
to the writing of history should better undertake that job 
and it was, I thought, proper from the point of view of 
division of labour. So off and on I tried in that direction. 
SARDESAI HIMSELF SEES ME 
1001. By.the way, it would, I think, be proper to relate 
just here a small incident which bears on this topic. I had 
an earnest desire to see the late Shree Sardesai from my 
very young days. For, his books on Indian history we had 
been reading constantly. But we were all revolutionaries, 
while he was a high placed servant of a king—although that 
king happened to be the ruler of a feudatory state like 
Baroda—subordinate to the British government ! Again he 
was older; I was younger I Later on I was transported to the 
Andamans and was eventually released from there in 1924. 
I learn from other people that Sardesai praised my revolu­ 
tionary activities as brave deeds. So up to the time I was 
at Ratnagiri I sincerely felt that Sardesai should write a 
History of the Marathas in English. As such I sent oral 
messages to him to that effect, because every letter of mine 
was a burning spark of fire, which was most likely to reduce 
to ashes the whole house of a government officer like him. 
Such things often happened in our revolutionary life. So I 
kept quiet. And one fine morning an old gentelman appeared 
at my door-step, my rented tenement in the house of Shree 
Nana Patwardhan at Ratnagiri. I got up in deference to 
his grey hair and asked, "Whom have I the pleasure to 
•408 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
receive ?" "I ain Sardesai from Baroda," came the 
answer, "whom you know as the writer of Indian history." 
I was surprised. "What ? Riyasat-Kar Sardesai ?" When he 
nodded his head in assent I told him how I had cherished 
high respect for him ever since I had read his big volumes 
on Muslim Riyasat. I told him that I had read all of his 
books. But having had a chance of mixing with non-Marathi 
scholars I could authoritatively say that they had no 
knowledge of the greatness of, nor even a nodding acquaint­ 
ance with, the essence of Maratha history; many of them 
bear a sort of grudge towards the Marathas. So I requested 
him to undertake the writing of an authentic, handy history 
based on solid facts so that non-Marathi world might know 
it in its true form and perspective; upon which he said that 
some one else should do it now. So I said, "No, at least 
today you are the only authoritative writer who can 
possibly do it. Although your old age may present difficulties, 
you should undertake it as the crowning glory of your life 
work. Possibly it will be completed ! You seem to have 
been blessed with a long life. At least you should begin at 
once to write such a history in English." Then after sonie 
casual talk while seeing him off I expressed my gratitude at 
the visit of such a great historian at my residence. Before 
oven my sentence was completed, he said "No, No, the real 
pleasure is mine ! We are all the writers of history; but you 
are the makers of history ! When you make history we note 
it down and I came here with a sincere desire to see you 
as the maker of history. And then we took leave of each 
other with thankful hearts. 
1002. And I think it would be proper to set down just 
here that some fifteen years or so after this visit of ours 
he wrote as the ripe fruit of his life a detailed history of the 
Marathas in English in three volumes. 
1003. As soon as I came to Ratnagiri, after being 
released from the Andamans, I was forbidden to take any 
active part in politics and because of the ban on the change 
of town I was forced to set limits to my movements. So in •5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 409 
this restricted life of mine at Ratnagiri, I decided that! 
myself should write a discursive book although without any 
help from reference books which would interpret and explain 
the unrivalled valour of the post-Shivaji Maharashtra and 
the freedom of the Hindu nation that it effected by destroy­ 
ing the Muslim domination. Why, before the end of February 
1926 I completed the writing of that book. 
HINDU PATPADSHAHI 
1004. The very name of that book I chose as 'Hindu 
Patpadshahi' rather than merely the history of the Marathas. 
For, in my opinion, the Marathas in general did not fight 
•only for Maharashtra, nor for their household, land or their 
fields. Their sole objective was to liberate Hindu religion 
and Hindu nation—of which Maharashtra was known to them 
to be only a part—from the yoke of Muslim domination and 
to establish all over India a sovereign Hindu power*. The 
inner urge of the new resurgent Maharashtra was to dethrone 
the Muslim imperial power at Delhi', and to hoist in its place 
the Hindu imperial standard. The anguish that rankled in 
the hearts of the Hindus and that found expression in Shree 
Ramdas's famous couplet— 
1005-6. m Hsp^r ^ ^ ^ r srifV i 
('Nowhere on the face of this whole earth is there left any 
Hindu') 
was mainly responsible for all the future glory of the 
Marathas ! The heartache of the Hindus as expressed by

410 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
retreats, consistent or inconsistent historical events, which so 
far baffled the greatest of historians can well be explained by 
the magic words 'Hindu Nation'and 'Hindu Imperial Power'. 
Hence it isth at I named that book as, 'Hindu Patpadshahi', the 
name which stamped its own seal on the history of the millen­ 
nial Hindu-Muslim war, by gaining ultimate victory over it. 
1009. Even in this book of mine the history of the 
Marathas has not been given in all its details, because histo­ 
rians have already done that work most painstakingly and 
on a larger scale. Jadunath Sarkar who wrote in English 
and Riyasatkar Sardesai who wrote in Marathi had already 
written books collocating all the available research-work,, 
most laboriously done by several research scholars and 
assimilating and interpreting it in the best way they could. 
It is therefore to avoid needless repetition that I did not 
attempt to write a detailed history of the Marathas. More­ 
over, sitting as I was in the small room, made available to­ 
me for my residence in a small village of Shirgaon near 
Ratnagiri, by my friend Shree Vishnupant Damale, even in. 
those days of local detention imposed on me by the British 
Government, I could not think of writing such a big volume- 
without the aid of reference books ! 
T H E H I N D U N A T I O N 
1010. Just as a man lost in a dense forest on a dark; 
night can see everything in its true perspective, in its form 
and colour, as soon as he throws around him a flash-light 
from the electric torch in his travelling kjt, and in that 
enlightened state of his mind can very easily find his way 
out, similarly very early in my college days, when I threw 
the electric search-light of the Hindu national point of view 
on the then extensive but chaotic mass of details about the 
history of the Marathas, my mind too, became suddenly 
enlightened. Viewed in that brilliant light of the national 
Hindu outlook, that whole incoherent, loose and chaotic 
mass of historical details regarding the Maratha enterprise- 
appeared to me absolutely consistent and well-defined. Then. 
• 
, 6 T;H G L O R I O U S E ? O O H 4 U 
alone was it that its essential greatness and unique character became apparent to me. The import and essence of Maratha history is most certainly not as it appeared to most of the historians, including Jadunath Sarkar, who read it simply as the history of the Marathas and found it self-centred, self- seeking, marauding, bellicose and mediocre. On the contrary, J could well see in it the grand manifestations of a Maha­ rashtra (a great nation) which had singly accepted with a grave determination the onerous responsibility of meeting and beating down the challenge for the supremacy over our country, thrown by all the foreign powers in the three conti­ nents of Asia, Europe and Africa—i.e. the whole of the then known world—by the non^Hindu aggressors who had attacked our great Hindu Nation. Especially when even after conti- .nuously fighting, although not unitedly, severally, yet grimly enough, with these aggressors for over ten centuries, no other Hindu state nor any other Hindu community seemed to win that epic war, annihilating the enemy completely, it is significant that Maharashtra should do it. 
THE HINDU WAR OF INDEPENDENCE 
1011. It is, therefore, as a sacred national duty, that I earnestly request every loyal Hindu, settng aside all false humility to read the above mentioned book of mine, viz. 'Hindu Patpadshahi' which surveys the Hindu War of Independence, carried on by the Marathas from the seven­ teenth century, from the Hindu national standpoint. For, looking at it, as impersonally as it is possible to do so, this one of all the extant books on the history of this period appears even to me as the most stimulating, most searching and teeming with the national spirit imbued with Hindutwa. Ranade forever closed the mouths of the foreign as well as our own historians, which derided the Maratha history of the times of Chhatrapati Rajaram as the anarchy of the rabble, and called it the Maratha War of Independence*. 
1012. But the all-India war which the Marathas fought ifor.nearly a century subsequent to the times of Rajaram was 
412 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INE>IAN HISTORY 
not merely a Maratha War of Independence, it was an all- 
India war of Hindu Independence. My book, 'Hindu Pat­ 
padshahi', is really the golden temple of the survey and 
appraisal of that great war—an enthralling piece of sculpture 
in colour and solidity, of the Goddess of that great war, like 
any in the caves of Ajantha. 
1013. And still every paragraph in that book is based 
on solid evidence, not because extracts from the writings of 
other renowned historians of acknowledged authority have 
been freely used therein, but because the very sentences 
uttered by the heroes who actually fought on the various 
battlefields and by those who actually played the political 
and diplomatic game are cited. Extracts from the letters 
fresh from their hands, written just after the events have been 
profusely used. As such the book is as authoritative as it is 
interesting to read. The genius of the historian, Rajwade, does 
not seem to have altogether missed this all-India character 
of this Maratha history. But in his writings it did not 
receive the all-round treatment it deserved. Perhaps his 
writing itself was so extensive and varied as to preclude even 
the vast intellectual capacities of the man from grasping its 
full significance and import. His incidental and desultory 
discourses on the subject appear, by the very nature of their 
topics, incomplete and inconsistent. About the English, 
Muslim and other historians we had better not say anything. 
Und er such circumstances, therefore, my book Hindu Pat­ 
padshahi estimating this great Hindu-Muslim War through 
the Hindu national angle of vision is the only one of its kind. 
That is why I recommend it whole-heartedly to every 
Hindu nationalist. 
1014. That is why, again, and because of my failing 
health I do not propose to go in for that review of the war 
in these pages. The curious readers might advisedly read it 
from those pages. It is only necessary here in these pages 
of the Six Glorious Epochs of Hindu Victories over the Ag­ 
gressors to display the golden chain of events which led 
ultimately to the pinnacle of glory that the Hindus obtained 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 413 
by finally subduing the Muslim power at the close of this 
millennial Hindu-Muslim war of epic dimensions. 
A CHAIN OF RARE AND REMARKABLE EVENTS 
1015. The first of such rare and remarkable events, 
which at the outset appears trivial but, viewed now from the 
telescope of historical studies, assumes exceptional impor­ 
tance and which follows immediately after the account of 
this Hindu-Muslim war given in this book up to Ch. 20 is 
The Birth of Shivaji either in 1627 or 1630 A.D. 
1016. Shivaji's father, Shahaji, was reckoned among 
the petty Maratha chieftains and noblemen®, who took active 
part in the political movements of the time. But all of them 
had to owe allegiance to some one of the five Muslim Sultans 
that they might enjoy their own knighthood or 'Jagirdari'. 
Not a single Hindu independent State—not even the smallest 
that can be thought of—had remained throughout the whole 
of Maharashtra. But the son, born to the above mentioned 
Shahaji Raje, was, however, destined by Providence to lead 
the Hindu War of Liberation and to be honoured with the 
auspicious red mark, applied to his head, of the gushing 
blood of the mortally wounded Muslim power, heralding the 
event of Hindu independence ! 
A WONDERFUL COINCIDENCE 
1017. Whether because of good fortune or because it 
was the will of God, whether again owing to mere accidental 
coincidence or as the extraordinary harvest reaped from the 
well-coordinated sowing of the seeds of gigantic efforts—call 
it what you will—but ever since the birth of Shivaji from the 
womb of his mother Jijabai, there was a strange turn given 
to the technique of the national front in this Hindu-Muslim 
War. 1018. Generally speaking, right from the beginning of 
the eighth century to that of the seventeenth, wherever the 
mighty armies of the Muslims and the Hindus fought, where- 
ever the Hindus and the Muslims were engaged in decisive 
414 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS-OF INDIAN HISTORY 
battles affecting the destinies'of the states and the Hindu 
nation as a whole it was the Hindu who usually, barring 
ionourable exceptions, suffered crushing defeats with heavy 
losses in men and material, sometimes because some leader sat 
in 'Howda' on the elephant*, while at others one sat in palan­ 
quin'—sometimes because there was treachery in the Hindu ' 
ra'nks,* at others again when victory was almost in Hindu 
hands—mere chance coincidence deflected it towards the 
Muslims. This cruel verdict of the Goddess of War was as it 
were, predetermined. The resistance offered by the brave 
Daheer, the one offered by the valiant Jayapal or his son 
Anangpal or the last battle given by Veer Prithviraj or again 
the one fought by Maharana Sang, in every decisive action 
fought throughout, through all these centuries upto that 
fought in 1665 A.D. at Talikot by the dauntless Ramraja 
of Vijaynagar the scales of war turned always against the 
Hindus—the Hindus alone were unmistakably defeated !! 
BUT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 17TH 
CENTURY 
1019. That means from the birth of Shivaji, so to say, 
the same cruel Goddess of War began to show a highly 
astonishing difference in her verdict regarding the same 
Hindu-Muslim struggle. And it was this I Just as formerly 
it seemed almost predetermined that the Hindus were bound 
to be defeated in every Hindu-Muslim struggle, similarly 
now onwards, wherever the Hindu-Muslim armies met, the 
Hindus' victory was almost assured and the Muslim defeat a 
foregone conclusion I Prom this seventeenth century onwards 
wherever they met the Muslims in a state of war, the Hindus 
invariably vanquished them ! Whether they were the decisive 
Tjattles shaking the very foundations of states or nations or 
whether they were only fleeting skirmishes, the victory for 
the Hindus and the rout of the Muslims was the result ! 
Every Hindu young man should necessarily read the long 
list of H i n d u victories from the same book of mine viz : 
Hindu Patpadshahi, the victories which swell our hearts 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 415 
with pride, the victories again that Were won not only on 
land from the Punjab to Kanya Kumari in the south seas 
but in hundreds of naval engagements from the Western (the 
so-called Arabian sea !) to the Eastern (the Bay of Bengal) 
seas! 
THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF THE NEW MARATHA 
STRATEGY 
AGGRESSION—NOT MERELY DEFENCE 
1020. The most important reason why since the time 
the Marathas assumed the military leadership of the Hindu 
nation, the H i n d u s alone went on winning victories, as has 
been already shown above, all over the vast sub-continent 
of India whenever they joined battle with the Muslims, was 
that these Marathas with their daring valour, had at once 
purged the Hindu mind of that pernicious epidemic of the 
perverted sense of virtues, which had afflicted and paralysed 
most of the Hindu society all over India and which had 
given birth to the false notion of chivalry, deeming it highly 
despicable from the ethical point of view, a veritable sin, as 
it were, to lead a military attack—even against the direst 
enemy. 
1021. In fact the creed of every national army is to 
march upon the enemy even before the latter attacks—to 
lead a blatant aggression, not merely to stage defensive 
formations ! The first successful attempt to inspire this 
aggressive mentality amongst the Hindus was made at the 
time of the establishment of the Vijaynagar empire against 
the Muslims, even before the Marathas took the lead. But 
it was restricted to the south alone and the terrible defeat 
at Talikota deterred the Hindu mind from invading the 
Muslims. It was then that the Marathas inspired the Hindus 
with a new war-like spirit by successful inroads upon the 
Muslims. 
1022. To invade the enemy territory is the chief aim or 
the chief duty of a national military strength. The nation 
which maintains armed forces just strong enough for the 
416 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
purposes of defence—and does not build it up so as to be 
capable to undertake an invasion and considers it improper 
to do so—is eitber basically coward at beart or is labouring 
under a delusion. Perhaps it is to camouflage that inward 
cowardice that such high sounding declarations are made.. A 
nation whose armed might is evidently built up on the basis 
of its aggressive capacity is certainly capable of self-defence. 
1023. Again, the Hindu aggression against the violent 
and unjust political domination of the Muslim rulers was 
basically not an aggression at all. The really unjust aggres­ 
sion was that of the Muslims who had invaded the territories 
of the Hindus. The aggressive risings of the Hindus against 
the outrageous Muslim rule can never be called revolts or 
rebellions. Por, the aggression of the Muslim rulers against 
the independent and rightfully established Hindu states was 
itself mutinous and revolting. The rising of a robber against 
the rightful owner can be called mutinous, not the taking 
up of arms by the rightful owner to chastise the rebellious 
freebooters ! It is, therefore, to inspire with indomitable 
courage the majority of the Hindu society all over India, 
which had taken fright of these Muslim freebooters, that 
Shree Ramdas raised his war-cry from every peak of the 
Sahyadri 
"Ic is the Muslim-insurrection ! 
'The insurgents are the Muslims and not the Hindus ! In 
order to punish them severely invade them from all sides 
all at once ! 
1024. "^^'imit ^TT? I ^it^^ ^r^sTfftr ^XKl^ i 
(One should court death for the sake of religion (But) while 
dying one should kill (the enemies) and by thus killing them 
one should win back one's kingdom.) 
1025. The most important weapon of this aggressive 
war policy of the Marathas was at least till that time a new 
one to the Hindus. It was not used so far by any before 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 417 
them. That weapon is 
GUERRILLA WARFARE 
1026. This type of war is called in Sanskrit 'Vraky- 
uddha' 
This Vrakyuddha (f^^s) of the Marathas humbled the 
vast armies of the Muslims. According to the peculiar mode 
of this guerrilla warfare the Marathas never faced the highly 
well-equipped fourfold armies of the enemy. Whenever the 
Maratha forces were small in number, they attacked the 
enemy from the right or the left flanks or from behind, 
1027. Yet it should be borne in mind that while thus 
harassing and cutting off the huge armies of the Moghals with, 
their meagre numbers and inadequate arms, they never 
hesitated to offer pitched battles standing face to face at the 
most unexpected moments, if they found that their own 
military strength had grown sufficiently strong to do this. 
As |even when the Maratha forces went on increasing in 
number and quality, and their responsibility about the 
various states, smaller or greater in size, about the forts and 
territories that fell in their hands, began to assume enormous 
dimensions, they did not lie idly in their different capitals, 
guarding their own positions. Every-one of them had 
always a keen eye on the neighbouring or the distant Moghal 
territories and pushed on into those territories as soon as the 
monsoons were over, even before the enemy had time to come 
aggressively against the smaller Maratha feudal lords and 
Jagirdars or their forts. The Maratha forces attacked 
even the Muslim Nawabs and Nizams, who never gave them 
offence under some pretext or another. Moreover they were 
hardly to be found in their usually known capitals, great or 
small, or in their forts or caves known to be their usual 
resorts. On the the contrary they seemed to carry their so, 
called capitals on horse-back while they started on their 
campaigns against the Muslims. The de facto address of the 
various Maratha war-lords and their brave followers was not 
their homes or fortresses; it was invariably their ever shifting 
418 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
camps or bivouacs in the Moghal territories. . 
1028. Even a solitary instance in the times of Rajaram, 
regarding Aurangzeb may be sufBcient to show clearly what 
great havoc was caused amongst the vast and unwieldy 
Muslim armies, harassed, hacked and hewed by.these Maratha 
guerrillas ! The huge armies of Aurangzeb pursued the 
Maratha forces right up to Jinji (or Zinji) in the South, 
reducing their territories as they went. But ?—The moment 
they turned their backs, they saw that smaller bands of the 
Maratha irregulars had already crossed the Narmada and 
after having entered Gujarath they had frightened the 
•Subhedar of that province out of his wits'. Farther off, the 
Jtfarathas were often reported to have attacked the central 
provinces to the utter dismay of the already confused Moghal 
Emperor. In the end giving up Maharashtra as precipitately 
as they would have dropped a glowing cinder from their 
hands, those huge Moghal hosts hacked, harassed and harried 
by the indomitable Maratha warriors, retreated, crestfallen, 
back to Delhi". 
1029. It is not correct to assume that the Marathas 
had resorted to this aggressive war policy only so far as 
their martial power was concerned but that their administra­ 
tive machinery had not had a sound footing or had not 
grown sufficiently strong. On the other hand they renewed 
their aggressive incursions into the remaining Muslim 
territories under the command of the invincible veteran war 
leaders, like Bajirao I, with greater rigour and zest, when 
•every one of their several Sardars and Chieftains had tens 
and scores of thousands of soldiers under them, fighting, 
conquering and establishing Maratha rule right from Jinji to 
•Gujarath and even Malwa and Central India ! If at all they 
were to establish Hindu-Patpadashahi throughout the whole 
of India, the defensive war policy of 'preserving whatever 
they had' would have been of little use. They had necessarily 
to adopt the bolder policy making new acquisitions. That 
way those brave and indefatigable Maratha warriors had an 
insatiable desire to assail their religious enemies whenever •6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 419 
and wherever they could ! 
THE AGGRESSIVE WAR POLICY OF THE 
MARATHAS 
STOPPED THE INROADS OF THE FOREIGN 
ENEMIES BEYOND THE HIMALAYAS 
1030. The reports that the bold thursts of Bajirao I 
right up to the gates of Delhi had convulsed the Moghal 
imperial power to its very foundations and rendered it 
•disjointed, and that the mighty Maratha armies were about 
to invade the territories even beyond Delhi upto the Punjab, 
•did not fail to give a rude shock to the Muslim powers of 
Kabul, Ghazni, Iran, Turan, Balkh, Bokhara, Arabia and 
•other countries beyond the Himalayas ! 
1031. It has already been shown in this book how, 
before the rise of the Marathas, these very Arab, Iranian, 
Durani, Tiirk, Moghal and other Muslim tribes had often 
swooped down the Himalayas into the Indian plains with all 
the ferocity and barbarity at their command; how some of 
these Muslim aggressors overran the Hindu states, dashed 
towards the south, worsting the Hindu religion, heaping up 
inhuman religious persecution and untold devilish atrocities 
•on its adherents; and again how some others of them establi­ 
shed their own independent stable Sultanates at Delhi and 
like Alauddin made straight for the southernmost end of 
India. 
EVEN THEN 
1032. The then Hindu Kings themselves could not 
invade Iran, Turan or Arabia beyond the Himalayas even 
before those diabolic Muslim aggressors could trespass the 
Indian territory. They could annihilate those Muslim 
invaders in their very homes ! 
NADIRSHAH AND ABDALI 
1033. But so soon as the Marathas assumed the Hindu 
420 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORV 
leadership all over India in this millennial Hindu-Muslim 
epic war and so soon again as the ramparts of Delhi began to 
crumble with the forcible thrusts of the Maratha arms this- 
age-old notorious habit of the Muslim aggressive tribes and 
states in Asia of attacking every now and then like Mahmud 
of Ghazni, with vociferous vows of complete destruction of 
the Hindus and their religion, was for ever broken ! Since 
the time the Maratha arms brought Delhi under their control 
and the imperial administration at Delhi began to obey the- 
dictates of the valiant Peshwa, like Bajirao I, only two, 
Nadirshah of Iran and Ahmedshah A b d a l i of Ghazni, dared! 
cross the Indian borders from beyond the Himalayas, putting: 
on the pompous airs of the former Muslim invaders swearing 
terrible wrongs unto the people herein and longing in vain 
to become the Emperors of India. But really speaking none 
of them had come upon India, like the former invaders, on 
their own initiative and with an irresistible itch. The full 
knowledge that the Marathas had succeeded in establishing 
the Hindu rule all over India upto Delhi or that they could 
do so, had overawed both Nadirshah and Abdali, too ! It was 
only at the supplications of the Muslim Sardars of Delhi and 
Punjab and at times the secret finvitation of the Emperor 
himself that Nadirshah and Ahmedshah made bold to cross, 
the Hindukush and march upon India. The Rohillas, the 
Pathans and the Moghals secretly pleaded that the Marathas- 
had practically usurped the whole power, that the Kafirs were 
gradually becoming dominant throughout the whole of India, 
and that they were approaching those foreigners as the 
defenders of the Muslim faith in order that they might invade 
India to save the Muslim imperial power at Delhi". They 
even offered to make those foreign Muslim leaders the 
Emperors of Delhi. It was on the invitations of these Indian 
Muslims and depending on their strength and assistance that 
the above-mentioned violent aggressors could think of 
attacking India. 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 421 
THE INVASION OF NADIRSHAH 
1034. Of the Muslim Sardars, Emirs and Khans who 
secretly invited Nadirshah to invade India in order to crush 
the Marathas, Nizam-ul-Mulk was the most prominent^*. As 
Bajirao I had vanquished him completely, he fondly hoped 
that the Marathas would be squarely punished and destroyed 
by Nadirshah. He did not care what would happen subsequ­ 
ently. Nadirshah crossed Attock and reached Lahore in 
1732". The Emperor of Delhi made a grand show of opposing 
him with his army. But in the very first battle he was routed 
entirely". Nadirshah called him and put him in his prison. 
Nizam too was similarly reprimanded for suffering the 
Marathas to be so very powerful aa to engulf the imperial 
power of Delhi, and because he did not pay the several crores 
•of rupees that he had promised, Niazm, too, was put behind 
the bars". Then Nadirshah marched straight to Delhi. On the 
10th of March. 1739 Nadirshah liquidated the Moghal imperial 
•power and proclaimed himself the Emperor of India". With 
precipitate haste he not only followed the age-old Muslim 
imperial tradition but far outdistanced it with all sorts of 
monstrocities and orgies of blood and fire. Plunder, arson 
and man-slaughter ran riot in the streets of Delhi". The 
Muslims, however, hoped that Nadirshah would at least 
annihilate the Marathas. But deliberately or knavishly 
N^adirshah did not offend the Marathas. Why, in his rage of 
Delhi he never spared the Muslims^*. Nadirshah himself 
seated the Nizam on the back of a donkey and forced him to 
undergo the humiliation of a parade throughout this city". 
1035. Soon the news came headlong that the Marathas 
had inflicted a great defeat upon the Portuguese and thewell- 
Iknown sea-port of Bassein (Vasai) had been conquered from 
the latter^", and that the Portuguese Governor of the place 
and his army had laid down their arms and sued for peace 
with the Marathas*^, and that feeling himself free, therefore, 
to do as he liked, Bajirao I had started with huge 
ipreparations and was heading towards Delhi**.

The Maratha Sardars in the North and the various 
diplomats and political workers that Bajirao I had stationed 
everywhere also felt keenly that Nadirshah had to be taught 
a lesson. From various different places they informed 
Bajirao about the movements of Nadirshah and the state-

sent similar spirited letters full of confidence and urging bold 
action ! On the basis of those letters Bajirao addressed in 
these stirring words those dignitaries at Chhatrapati Shahu's

heroic and aggressive moves and bring all sorts of impedi­ 
ments in his progressive measures, "0 ! you brave warriors,

and the glorious dawn of the founding of Hindu-Patpadashahi 
is a certainty beyond all measure. I, for my part, am deter­ 
mined to cross the Narmada (river) and deploy my troops 
everywhere right upto the Chambal (river) I shall see than 
how Nadirshah dares descend southwards** ! 
1039. As soon as he received the news that the 
Marathas were already on an aggressive march to the north 
against him Nadirshah lost all his enthusiasm to push 
forward with his conquests to south India as did the former 
Irani, Turani, Turkish and other Muslim aggressors before 
him; and with a view to pack off before the Marathas 
reached Delhi, he voluntarily relinquished the imperial 
authority, reinstalled the former Emperor of Delhi on his 
throne** and admonished all the courtier and feudatory 
princes and vassals to obey the Moghal emperor. There­ 
after Nadirshah hurriedly went back to Persia with the 
enormous plunder of about five to six hundred million rupees 
worth of treasure and the peacock-throne and other pieces 
of art*'. And that, too, he did because of the fearful 
apprehension of a counter-attack by the Marathas**! 
1040. Along with the letters that he sent to other 
princes and Kings and vassals of India, Nadirshah sent one 
to Bajirao Peshwa, commanding him peremptorily to be 
always faithful to the Moghal Emperor and with a stern 
424 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
warning of the consequent punishment in case he failed to do so**. Foolishly enough did Nadirshah write this letter, but wisely he retreated I It goes without saying that this pre­ posterous letter of Nadirshah's was shown its way to the waste-paper basket, and in A.D. 1739, Chhatrapati Shahu unequivocally declared in his court that Nadirshah took a f r i g h t o f t h e M a r a t h a r e t a l i a t i o n a n d fled a w a y o u t o f Indias*. 
AHMADSHAH ABDALI BECOMES THE 
EMPEROR OF KABUL 
1041. In Nadirshah's army and under his command had 
been rising on the strength of his own merit, a certain Afghan 
Sardar (Emir) called Abdali, who ultimately became the 
former's right hand man*^. Abdali had accompanied 
Nadirshah in his above mentioned raid against India'*. 
After his return to Persia, Nadirshah was soon killed in 
1747*'. In the confusion that was caused subsequent to 
Nadirshah's death, Ahmadshah Abdali usurped all power 
and since he was an Afghan, Ahmadshah proclained himself 
an Afghan Emperor making Kabul his capital (1747 A.D.)'*. 
THE ROHILLAS AND THE PATHANS 
1042. Now there had been an incessant internal rivalry 
about the acquisition of the imperial throne of Delhi and 
consequent mutual hatred between the Moghals and the 
Afghans (Pathans)'*, who chiefly led the Muslim administra­ 
tion throughout the large tract of India from the Punjab 
Delhi, Farukhabad to Rohilkhand'*—sometimes quite openly, 
at other times covertly I The former Sultanates of Delhi were 
Afghans. It was after extirpating the last of the Afghan 
dynasties that the victorious Moghal conqueror, Babar, had 
attained the imperial power over Delhi (as has already 
been shown in this book earlier). Nevertheless, several 
Afghan Sardars dominated even this Moghal administration. 
Amongst these Afghans the Rohillas and the Pathans had 
their own states of varying sizes''. Later on when the 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 425 
conquering Maratha armies soon began to establish, one after 
another, Hindu states all over the Northern half of India 
and reached Delhi and when in the political affairs of Delhi 
practically not a blade of grass could move without the 
Maratha support, all those Muslim factions became absolute­ 
ly one at least in the early years of the Maratha preponder- 
•ence in order to subvert it'*. Yet later still the dissentient 
and scheming amongst these Muslim leaders secretly sought 
for the Maratha help for the destruction of their co-religionist 
opponents'*. 
THE FIRST INVASION OF INDIA BY ABDALI 
1043. Abdali was closely watching these developments 
in Delhi. He knew full well that the Pathans over there 
Tvere highly perturbed lest the hated Marathas might 
leave a vestige of their own existence, unless in the mean­ 
while, the Pathans overthrew the Moghal imperial authority 
over Delhi, and, on its ashes, raised their own. They could 
find only one way out of this predicament : to invite the 
new Afghan emperor, Ahmadshah Abdali, who had all 
along supported their political moves. So the Pathan-Rohilla 
leaders sent letters to Abdali importuning his armed help 
if at all Islam in India was to be saved*". Abdali, too, 
had cherished the ambition to strangle the moribund Moghal 
imperial authority in Delhi and to revive in its place the 
Pathani rule as of yore*^. But earlier he had visited India 
along w i t h the warriors of Nadirshah's invasion and was 
fully conscious of the growing Maratha influence in the 
imperial administration at Delhi. So he was far too cautious 
in making his moves. After having secretly supplied all 
sorts of armed help to the Pathans and Rohillas in the Doab, 
Abdali himself came aggressively in the month of January 
1748 upto Lahore** and captured it. This was the first of his 
invasions of India. 
1044. But the Moghal imperial army defeated Abdali's 
•advance guards just near Lahore and blocked his way to 
-Delhi*'. Just at this time he got reports that his enemy. 
426 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
the Emperor of Persia, was preparing to invade Kabul**, 
and that, at the invitation of the Moghal Emperor to help 
arrest his onward march the Marathas had set out with a. 
large army towards Delhi**. So considering it to be 
inopportune to press onwards to Delhi that shrewd general 
Abdali retreated immediately to Kabul**. But before his. 
departure he had it proclaimed throughout India that the 
whole of the Punjab was subject to the sovereign Afghan; 
rule under him. 
THE FIRST TREATY OF SURRENDER 
BY THE MORIBUND MOGHAL EMPIRE 
WITH THE MARATHAS 
1045-46. In the meanwhile the Moghal Emperor at 
Delhi had delegated most solicitously all administrative 
authority over the whole of India right from Bengal, Bihar,. 
Orissa to Sindh (including the Subha of Multan), the whole 
of the Punjab, Rohilkhand, Doab and all the South-Indiam 
divisions of the Moghal empire to the Marathas by a special 
treaty*'. 
1047. By this treaty, by this written consent at least 
of the Moghal Emperor the Marathas had become since 
that date the de facto sovereigns of the whole of India, and 
the Moghal Emperor himself had been reduced to a non­ 
entity. 
1048. The tremendous responsibility that devolved- 
upon the Marathas because of this change in the imperial 
administrative authority was, of course, the onerous one of 
defending the Moghal empire against all internal as well as 
external dangers—against internal rebellions and revolts as- 
well as against foreign invasions. Gigantic as this responsi­ 
bility was it was only the Maratha sinews that could bear it 
efficiently—the sinews that had almost realised the dream of 
the foundation of Hindu-Patpadashahi ! That is why they 
accepted that condition of the treaty quite readily as if it 
was a boon. 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 427 
ABDALI'S SECOND INVASION OF INDIA 
1049. Abdali bad been secretly given reports of this 
forthcoming imperial treaty with the Marathas six months- 
or more before the actual event. That is why in 1749 he 
invaded India for the second time simply to oppose the 
Marathas*'. So the imperial governor of the Punjab, Mir 
Mannu, himself ceded helplessly Thattha, Sindh (Multan,) the 
Punjab and other adjoining territories to Abdali and accep­ 
ted the overlordship of the latter over that region**. Satis­ 
fied with the thought that the Maratha authority over that 
region, relegated to them by the imperial treaty, was wiped 
out by the abject surrender of Mir Mannu, the imperial 
officer in charge of that part, and that the time for further 
advance was not yet, Abdali once again went bank to 
KabuIBO. 
1050. But the Marathas \tere highly infuriated at this 
duplicity of the imperial officer and the reported mute con­ 
sent of the Emperor himself to this treacherous act. The 
Marathas vowed to avenge Abdali's usurpation of the region 
between Sindh, Thattha to Punjab, in defiance of the Moghal- 
Maratha treaty just as furiously as would a cobra whose tail 
has been trodden down wilfully. But they were at this time 
preoccupied with the South-Indian Muslims*^, the westerners 
like the Portuguese** and also with the domestic political 
troubles at Satara*'. As such Nanasahib Peshwa ordered' 
Malharrao Holkar and Jayajirao Shinde, and the two Maratha 
leaders crossed the Jamuna and fell upon the fifty-to sixty- 
thousand-strong army of the Rohillas encamped at Kadar- 
gunj on the 20th March, 1751. The Pathans fought tenaciously,, 
but in the end the Marathas completely routed and destroyed 
the joint army of the 'original and legitimate' Pathans and 
Rohillas**. Quickly following this signal success the Mara­ 
thas fought the Pathan Ahmadkhan Bangash, who had come 
on a hot scent to Farukhabad with his army**. Ahmadkhan 
took shelter in Farukhabad and was timely joined by the 
second mighty army of the Rohillas**. But again the 
Marathas besieged the conjoint army of these 'true born" 
428 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Eohilla-Pathans in the month of April, 1751 and fetching them in open fields inflicted a crushing defeat on that huge army on the 28th of April, 1751". About twenty to twenty- five thousand Pathans and Rohillas were cut oflF in the battle. Everything belonging to them including their camp was plundered. Thousands of horses, elephants, camels and the battery of guns were all captured. Jayappa Shinde writes in his letter, "The devotees of Hari appropriated that booty to themselves**." 
1051. When the Peshwa received the news of these battles Shreemant Nanasahib himself felt elated at the excep­ tional valour of the Marathas. In his congratulatory reply to the Sardars and soldiers he himself wrote :- 1052. m^m ^wm'i f | H f?f T^^ts

(Bravo, well done ! All Praise to your intrepidity and 
valour ! that the Southern armies should cross the Ganges 
and Jamuna and win a glorious victory over the Pathans in 
the open battle field is neither a small nor a common place 
thing ! You are single-minded loyal men of action, the 
pillars of the (Maratha) Empire ! Your fame has spread far 
beyond Iran and Turan. While the 'Queen' (on the chess­ 
board) had run astray, (you) have installed her at the 
vantage position once again ! 
THE MARATHAS HUMBLED TIME AND AGAIN 
THE HAUTEUR AND PRIDE OF THE 
TRUE-BORN' AND THE GREAEST 
MUSLIMS TOO ! 
1053. A common misleading statement is very often to 
be seen in the histories written not only by the Muslim, 
English, Portuguese and such other writers, who are natu- 5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 429 
rally inimical (hostile) towards the Marathas, and have always 
tried to disparage them and to detract from their glorious 
deeds, but also by some of the Hindu writers who evince a 
slavish mentality and only 'look' and 'write' (without using 
any independent judgment of their own)—a statement which 
purports to say : 
'One important cause why later on the Muslims were 
often defeated in India and why the Marathas could set in 
the process of disintegration of the Muslim empire under 
their crushing blows, was that the Muslims of the later days 
had lost much of the 'original' and 'real' blood and spirit of 
the early Arab, Mongol, Turkish, Irani, Durani, Afghan, 
Moghal invaders. Because of the racy climate beyond the 
Himalayas, big, rushing rivers, hilly and snowy territory and 
their hardy and robust constitution which was the result of 
their spending whole lives in constant warfare, and such 
other reasons, the comparatively more civilized and 'hence' 
milder and 'feebler' Hindus could not withstand their earlier 
invasions**. But as those wild and valorous Muslims from 
beyond the Himalayas began to settle down here for centu­ 
ries together, generation after generation, and as many of 
their dynasties ruled here, they, too, were victims of laziness, 
mildness, and proclivity towards luxurious living. They 
could not retain their former sturdiness, endurance and 
savage strength which could stand them in good stead on 
the battlefield. The 'unhealthy' climate of India did not 
fail to tell upon their originally strong wild bodies ! On the 
whole the descendants of those very Muslims came to be 
'weaker' and 'not true of their mettle'. That is why the 
Hindus, especially the Marathas could vanquish only those 
Muslims ! 
1054. How very imperfect and unrealistic is this state­ 
ment ! Only one instance of the Maratha offensive against 
the Rohillas and Pathans in the Doab and the fact that the 
Marathas killed as many as twenty thousand of the enemy in 
the action is quite sufficient to prove the falsity and plati­ 
tude of the above estimate of the Muslim failure ! The 
430 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Pathan-Rohillas ruling from the Doab to Rohilkhand at that 
time considered themselves to be 'high-born' Afghans of the 
finest mettle*". Even the Moghal imperial power and the 
Turkish Nawabs and chieftains dreaded them most*^. , These 
Afghans had even at that time close and uninterrupted 
blood-relations and family ties with the 'original' stalk of 
the Afghans beyond the Himalayas. Every year hundreds 
•of those 'true-bred' and 'real' Afghans came to reside in this 
Pathanistan in the Doab while the Afghans here went over to 
"their original homes. It clearly means, therefore, that the 
thousands of the Pathan-Rohillas in the long tract between 
the Doab and the Rohilkhand were, till that time at least, 
^real' and 'original', 'true-born' and 'thorough-bred' Pathans 
and Afghans ! And the Marathas ? They belonged, after all 
originally and traditionally, to that country—India—which 
iter enemies called sterile—born and brought up there for 
generations together ! Even then did they not often prove 
these so called 'true-born' and 'thorough-bred' Pathans and 
Afghans to be of baser mettle in the final test on the field 
of battle ? Even when Nadirshah fell upon Delhi with an 
army of the thousands of his 'true-born' and 'thorough-bred' 
Pathans crowned himself 'Emperor of Delhi' and threatend 
to march to the South like Mahmud of Ghazni, is it not 
because he realized in his heart of hearts that the times had 
then changed—that it was not the India of Ghazni's times— 
that now it was the Marathas whom he had to face—that he 
retreated so hastily and went clean out of India 1—Simply 
because of the dread of the Marathas ? In his wake followed 
Abdali invading India thrice or four times, every time with 
an army of not less than fifty thousand strong, made up of 
the pick of Turkish, Iranian, Durani, Pathan soldiery. But 
how every time had he to go back crest-fallen because of the 
armed counter-offensive of the Marathas, how even in the 
turning of the scales of fortune and even after the terrible 
losses for the Marathas at Panipat, had he to sign a 
treaty**, that the direction of the Moghal imperial aff"airs at 
Delhi be left into the hands of the Marathas, how he agreed 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 431 
not to interfere with it in the least, and how, relinquishing 
his high ambition to be the absolute and unlimited Emperor 
of Delhi he had to submit to the Marathas and go back never 
to return, can best be read by every Hindu from our book, 
Hindu Patpadshahi. It is going to be referred to again in 
the following pages. 
1055. Physical build, height and breadth and weight 
do count as important and decisive factors in matters of 
personal combats. Even then it cannot be made a rule 
without exception ! The grave of the monstrous Afzalkhan 
at the foot of Pratapgad is evidence enough ! But in the 
struggles of nations the chances of success or failure can 
never be assessed on the strength of physical build, enduring 
capacity and the stubbornness of constitution. Didn't the 
dwarfish Japanese laid the gigantic Russians lowon the battle­ 
field in the first Russo-Japanese war—the towering and sturdy 
Russians in comparison with whom the 'true-born' and 
'thorough-bred' Pathans seem absolute midgets ? Our 
Hindu Gorkhas are veritable Marathas in respect of stature. 
But haven't these very Gorkhas vanquished the Italian, 
the Austrian, and the colossal Hitlerian German armies on 
various occasions and on various battlefields in the last 
World War*' ? The whole world still resounds with the fame 
of the Gorkhas—'A Hindu Gorkha means a gallant fighter* 
is a common-place adage nowadays. Who once ruled as the 
invincible Emperor of all the European nations like Germany, 
Russia and others, renowned for their tall and sturdy 
soldiers, if not the 'short' Napoleon and his small French 
army. 
ABDALI'S THIRD INVASION OF INDIA 
1056. The Moghal Emperor had made Gazi-ud-din his 
chief minister (Vizier)** who went all the way long to Sarhind 
in the Punjab in February 1756 to appoint Adinabeg as the 
chief imperial officer there**. Gazi-ud-din acted in this case 
depending solely on the Maratha support, and this act of 
his clearly meant that the whole of the province of the 
432 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Punjab which was reduced by Abdali was once again seized 
by the Moghal Emperor. Even in Delhi, the Afghan 
influence was ineffectual and Gazi-ud-din, strongly supported 
by the Marathas, spoke for the Moghal Emperor**. Under 
these circumstances Malika Zamani, the old and crafty chief 
stewardess in the Moghal imperial household who was frigh­ 
tened out of her wits (at this all-enveloping Maratha hold 
on the Moghal Empire) and Nizibkhan Rohilla, who was 
then a prominent leader of all the Rohillas and Pathans in 
India and who was the bitterest enemy of the Marathas, 
secretly wrote letters to Ahmadshah Abdali to the effect 
that if at all Muslim power in India was to be saved it was 
Abdali alone who could save it, and that as such he should 
forthwith march on India with a well-equipped army*'. 
They had also mentioned the fact that the Maratha armies 
were occupied in the South, and that Delhi was practically 
defenceless. But the Moghal Emperor, they wrote, had 
already sent word to the Marathas to come to Delhi, in all 
haste. So i f A b d a l i was late, they argued, the Marathas 
were very likely to establish their authority right up to the 
Punjab, Thattha and Multan (Sindh) as per their treaty with 
the Moghal Emperor, and that they were to march with 
mighty armies on Delhi and the Punjab. 
1057. At this news Abdali was enraged beyond 
measure. It was to nullify the imperial charter (Sanad) 
which entrusted the government of the Punjab and the 
neighbouring region to the Marathas that he had recently 
invaded India and annexed that region to his kingdom. He 
therefore took it highly amiss that Gazi-ud-din should re­ 
incorporate that part into the Moghal empire, without any 
sort of appeal or reference made to him. Naturally once 
again he came to Peshawar in November 1756** with a view to 
invade India sending his son, Taimurshah, and his General 
Jahankhan to take Lahore*'. The Moghal general Adinabeg 
fought with Taimurshah, but was defeated, and there was 
nobody to beat down the orgy of sword and fire which the 
Afghan force indulged in while they rushed headlong from 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 433 
Lahore to Sutlej'". Emboldened by this Moghal infirmity 
Shah Abdali advanced straight to Delhi without stopping 
anywhere for rest, with an army of eighty thousand strong 
in January 1757 A.D.". Delhi fell into his hands practically 
without any resistance. Immediately he took over the impe* 
rial authority and began to run the government in his own 
name'2. 
1058. And he precipitately performed what the 
Pathans and Muslims of the time thought to be their first 
and foremost duty, according to the religious code of 
every Muslim Emperor. In order to make it suit his dignityj 
he even fumed and fretted at the slightest pretext and 
ordered a horrible general massacre of the citizens of 
Delhi" so that they might submit meekly to his rule 
over Delhi. Within a few hours 'true and high born' and 
'thorough bred' Afghans beyond the Himalayas slaughtered 
more than eighteen thousand people, and according to the 
second universally acknowledged notion of the time, 
regarding the regal function in accordance with the Muslim 
religious code, he proclaimed forthwith that as an humble 
and royal adherent of Islam he would completely destroy 
all the Kafirs and their temples and all religious institutions 
throughout India'* ! 
1059. Without any loss of time he brought his horrible 
announcement into action. Under his orders the Hindu tem­ 
ples, shrines, idols, and their houses began to be pulled down 
and set ablaze. Emperor Abdali was particularly infuriated 
against the several Hindu holy places like Mathura and 
Prayag which the Marathas had rescued from the Muslim 
hands. So he began to defile them all, one after another'*. 
On such occasions Mathura, which is very close to Delhi, 
was the first to fall a prey after Delhi to all sorts of 
vandalism of the monstrous aggressors; and stoically enough, 
did that holy city offer itself, time and again, as sacrificial 
oblution, as any brave lady in the famous immolation (Johar) 
of Chitod or the very city of Chitod itself. But this time it 
did not merely submit itself to the Muslim religious persecu- 
434 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
tion, without fighting, as it had been doing till this time. 
Although detailed description, is not possible here for want 
of space, it must be told here that nearly five thousand 
Hindu Jat citizens fought'*, to the last drop of blood left 
in them, that innumerable and well-organized Muslim army. 
JEvery brave Hindu, who died, did so only after killing as 
many of his Muslim foes as was possible for him to kill. 
After bathing Mathura in blood and burying it under 
heaps of the rubble of its demolished temples and shrines 
and idols, Abdali attacked another neighbouring holy 
place of Hindus, Gokul Vrindavan. This also had been the 
object of Abdali's fury for the simple reason that the 
Marathas had recently snatched it away from the Muslims. 
In order to halt this monstrous attack more than two 
thousand valiant 'gosavees' (monks), from the famous 
^ymnasiun of 'Nange Gosavee', suddenly fell upon the 
Muslim army, with a grim determination to fight unto death". 
This assault of the Gosavees was so sudden, so well organized 
and so ferocious that Abdali's forces reeled back all of a 
sudden at the first knock". Thousands of Muslim soldiers 
were killed outright, and the brave gosavees, too ! After 
t h e fierce fighting t h a t c o n t i n u e d t h r o u g h o u t t h e d a y t h e 
Muslims left the town and retreated" while the wounded 
and bleeding city resounded joyously and thankfully with 
praises for those Nange Bairagees (naked ascetics) who had 
defended its Gokulnath". If at all one wishes to be a naked 
ascetic (Nanga Bairagy) he should be one such I 
1060. Abdali then marched against Agra and invested 
that strong fort'^. In this very fort was fighting the direst 
enemy of the Pathan party in the imperial, court, and one 
who sincerely tried to save the Moghal imperial power, 
namely Gazi-ud-din'*, and he was every moment expecting 
reinforcements from his protectors, the Marathas I 
1061. But what were the Hindu kings and Princes of 
Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaypur and other neighbouring states, 
the sardars and noblemen of courts and the millions of their 
warriors and subjects doing at this critical time for the 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 435 
Hindu religion ? While Abdali was indulging in reckless 
and ruthless bloodshed of thousands of cows, of Hindu 
women and of the thousands of Hindu warriors, who sacri- 
1 ficed their lives in the defence of their religion, and while 
all the Hindu places of pilgrimage were being turned red 
with the blood of these innumerable Hindu martyrs, it was 
the common people in north-India, and not their rulers, 
who anxiously waited every moment for the arrival of the 
Marathas and the relief at their hands from all these 
atrocities ! But the rest of the Hindu Kings and Princes 
and landlords (Jagirdars), who had in their pay large 
fighting forces, wasted their time cherishing malice towards 
the Marathas*'. All the Erajput Princes were secretly longing 
for the destruction of the Marathas at Abdali's hands. 
Many of the Hindu rulers there—significant as well as 
insignificant—had been carrying on secret negotiations with 
Abdali**. But what, if Abdali had wiped out the Maratha 
influence from Sindh-Multan to the end of Rohilkhand and 
Nepal in the north, according to the wishes of the Hindu 
and Muslim rulers in the north ! The appalling answer to 
this question doesn't seem to have disturbed them a bit. 
.Except for the Marathas who else was there of these Hindu 
Princes and Kings who could have proved to be the destroyer 
and conqueror of the Muslim domination ? None at all ! 
What, then, could these incompetent Hindu Rajputs and 
others have gained if the Marathas had been destroyed by 
Abdali and the latter had once more established Muslim 
imperial power throughout the North of India ? All that 
would have happened was perhaps that a new wave of 
bloodshed of millions of Hindus and atrocitie.-5 at the orders 
of another imperial power of a new AUauddin or a new 
Aurangzeb would have swept the Hindu world'. 
1062. But perhaps it was because of the earne.^^t desire 
and heartfelt longing of the abovementioned millions of the 
Hindu commonalty, who themselves being disorganized 
were utterly powerless to do anything in the matter, except 
secretly wishing for the speedy arrival of the Marathas, who. 
436 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
in their opinion, were the only ones to smash the Muslim 
power completely or perhaps because of the original 
sustaining power of the Hindu nation in general that 
nothing of the kind happened. 
1063. For, on receiving letters from the Maratha 
sardars and Gazi-ud-din andjothers, Peshwa Nanasahib imme­ 
diately sent Malharrao Holkar under the chief command 
of Raghunathrao Dada, with a large army'*. Urgent letters 
were also sent to the Maratha Sardars like Govindpant 
Bundeley, Barve and others who were already in the North 
to render every sort of assistance to Raghunathrao". Before 
Raghunathrao left Indore and marched ahead news arrived 
that hearing the reports of the Maratha advance Abdali had 
left Mathura Vrindaban and other Hindu places of worship 
and pilgrimage, and gone to Delhi and thence to Kabul 
taking away all the booty he had acquired". But he had 
vested, before his departure to Kabul, the supreme command 
of that region in the hands of his son, Taimurshah, stationing 
ten thousand soldiers under him at Sirhind, and installing 
his officers at various important places in the Punjab". 
1064. While on this side the Maratha forces under 
different military leaders in the North which had gathered 
together under the one command of Raghunathrao began to 
punish severely all those who had begun anti-Maratha acti­ 
vities relying on Abdali for support. Sakharam Bhagwant, 
Gangadhar Yashwant and M a r a t h a Sardars entered the D o a b 
and once again beat down the Pathan-Rohilla malfactors, 
released and brought into their fold Vazir [Gazi-ud-din, who 
had been made a captive by the Abdali party". Vithal 
Shivadev himself marched on Delhi, and after about a fort­ 
night's fierce fighting entered the city triumphantly crushing 
down the Abdali faction completely. The greatest of the 
triumphs was that the direst enemy of the Marathas and 
Abdali's right-hand man, Najibkhan Rohilla, was caught 
alive'". Eventually Abdali's settlement of the region under 
his suzerainty toppled down completely. The Pathan army 
of ten thousand strong, which Abdali had stationed at Sir- 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 437 
Wnd under the command of Abdul Samad in order to 
maintain his hold on the region, itself lost courage. Conse­ 
quently when the Marathas themselves advanced menacingly 
towards Sirhind, there was a great commotion caused in the 
Muslim ranks even before a regular battle was joined and 
they were completely routed in the initial skirmishes and 
their commander was caught alive'^. This news made Taimur­ 
shah, the son of Abdali and his governor of the Punjab, and 
his commander-in-chief, Jahankhan, leave off their original 
plan of defending Lahore, and in the face of this forceful 
and precipitate Maratha counter-offensive both of them 
struck an honourable retreat to Kabul along with all their 
army, hardly daring to face the Marathas on the battlefield'*, 
Abdali had strictly urged upon them that they were under no 
<jircumstances to let the vast treasures of millions (crores) of 
Tupees, that was still in their possession, to fall in the enemy 
hands. As such they tried their utmost to carry it safely, 
retreating in as orderly a manner as was possible. But the 
JVIarathas not only pursued them even beyond Lahore but 
they played such a havoc in the Muslim ranks that Taimur­ 
shah crossed Attock and fled to his own province" leaving 
behind at various places all his elephants, horses, camels, 
and all the treasure in cash and jewellery, gold and silver. 
He had nothing to carry home of the vast plunder from India 
except his own life ! Whatever else belonged to him was 
either sacked or destroyed by the Marathas. Whatever 
little of his Afghan army escaped only with their lives to 
Kabul like their governor were the only ones that remained 
alive ! All of the veteran Pathan army of fifteen to twenty 
thousand strong which was kept behind in Delhi and the 
Punjab by Abdali to annihilate the Hindus and the Hindu 
religion throughout India was attacked group by group and 
massacred by the Marathas in the battles and skirmishes 
fought with them'* (17th March 1758). 
1065. Thus by inflicting crushing and humiliating 
defeats on Emperor Ahmadshah Abdali and by reconquering 
from the Afghan empire the whole vast region from Sindh 
438 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
to Multan and Multan to Sirhind, the Marathas once again 
gained the de facto control over the governance and admini­ 
stration of this extensive province which they had earlier 
gained by a paper treaty with the Moghal emperor ! But the 
then Moghal Emperor and his Vazir, Gazi-ud-din, themselves 
knew very well that in their own interest, too, it was essential- 
that the Marathas should do this. Hence the Emperor himself 
gave orders that Raghunathrao's formal triumphant entry 
into Lahore for the settlement of the affairs there was to be- 
celebrated publicly with all pomp and festivities'*. All the 
Hindu chieftains of Kashmir, Dogra nobles, 'Missals' of the 
Sikhs and the so-called Muslim Emirs, Umraos, 'Nizams^and 
Nawabs', who had been so far engaged in riotous actions and 
ravaging the country to their own sweet will, were so much 
overawed and struck dumb by this extraordinary heroism of 
the Marathas in recapturing the whole of the Punjab and the 
adjoining territories that they began to join the Maratha 
General Raghunathrao as subordinate allies. The Sikhs had 
been recently gaining control over things in the Punjab and 
they were infuriated by Abdali's wanton act of demolishing 
their golden temple at Amritsar and filling up their holy lake 
round it with filth, mud, stones and bricks during his retreat 
to Kabul for fear of the Marathas. They had, therefore, 
become inveterate enemies of Abdali, and a mighty leader 
of one of their powerful 'Missals', namely Alasing Jat (whom 
the Maratha correspondence of the times refers to as 'Ala 
Jat') had joined the Marathas'* openly in the battle of Sir­ 
hind. Hence as almost all these leaders and parties who had 
been then active in the political movements in the Punjab 
were favourable to such a grand ovation to be given to 
Raghunathrao, it was agreed on all hands that the Imperial 
ceremony felicitating the triumphal entry into Lahore of 
Raghunathrao at the head of his army should be celebrated 
after the Maratha general's successful campaign toward? 
Sindh. 6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 439^ 
THE TRIUMPHAT MARCH OF RAGHUNATHRAO 
PESHWA IN THE PUNJAB 
1066. Taimurshah., who fled beyond the frontier, tried 
to carry with him the immense treasure, the Muslims had 
plundered in India, and it was to seize that treasure that 
Raghunathrao entered the Punjab in hot pursuit of the- 
Pathan army which ran belter skelter. Conquering more 
than half of the Punjab and making it a hot bed for the 
scared Pathan army of Abdali, Raghunathrao drove them 
off to the frontier. Leaving the rest of the work of regaining 
the frontier to the other Maratha companies and brigades, 
he returned to Lahore, the Capital of the Punjab, in order to 
consolidate the Maratha gains and settle the affairs there and 
lay a firm foundation of the Maratha power in the newly 
acquired territory. On the 11th of April, 1758 he made his 
triumphant entry into Lahore with all the regalia and his 
victorious army. 
1067. A magnificent ovation was given to him in order 
to glorify this victorious entry of his, attended with feasting 
and dancing. Raghunathrao sojourned in no less a place 
than the imperial palace itself. The other prominent Maratha 
war-lords h.id also put up in big palaces in Lahore or the 
camps in the vicinity of the city. Everywhere hundreds of 
well-adorned elephants, horses, camels and fatted bulls 
paraded through the streets. Various big Hindu-Muslim Officers 
from different places. Emirs, Umraos, the so-called Nawabs, 
Nizams, Raos, Kings and courtiers presented themselves in the 
magnificent Darbar in the afternoon. Everyone of them, the 
political as well as the civil administrators, nay, even the 
imperial army in the Punjab, vowed allegiance to the Peshwa 
at Poona and Raghunathrao was honoured as the representa­ 
tive of that Peshwa. Every one of them tendered his homage 
in the form of rich gifts to Raghunathrao. At night the 
whole city was gloriously illumined. Dazzling fireworks were 
displayed everywhere. Even the neighbouring cities round 
about Lahore celebrated the feast of light and fire-works 
display. 
440 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
1068. What was the setting or the location of this 
triumphant assembly,—this feast of light ? It was no other 
than the recreation grounds of the greatest of the Moghal 
Emperors, like Akbar, Jahangir, Shahajahan and others—the 
extensive courtyard of the most famous Shalimar gardens of 
Lahore*' !! The Marathas had thus reduced the Muslim 
imperial power to serfdom ! 
1069. At the news of this glorious Maratha victory, 
there was literally a shower on Raghunathrao of the congra­ 
tulatory letters written not only by the numerous kings and 
courtiers, Sardars of various ranks and the learned Shastri- 
pandits, who were openly or secretly endeavouring beyond 
all measure in the cause of Hindu-Patpadshahi throughout 
the length and breadth of India, but by the self-less ascetics, 
also. As has been said in paragraph 991, the various writers 
of these multifarious congratulatory letters were so much 
overcome by a sense of pride and jubilation over this uncon­ 
ceivable Maratha victory that they could not convey their 
feelings in simple prose. These could only be conveyed 
through some mythological imagery, a sample of which can 
be had in this one sent to Raghunathrao on the Sth of May, 
1758 by a Maratha General in Delhi, Antaji Mankeshwar who 
was in the habit of writing nothing but simple political 
reports and yet who was one of the higher officers in the 
Maratha army. 
1070. "Received your Excellency's favour (of 13th 
April). How can I express adequately the excessive joy I 
felt at the news in your Excellency's letter about the victory 
at Lahore, the destruction of the enemy and the acquisition 
of the territories there ? (Your Excellency's) fame has spread 
far and wide in Hindustan (North India). The high-born 
Emirs and Umraos and Governors, all are overawed ! It is 
your Excellency alone who avenged (the wrong of the whole 
of Hindustan (North India) ! As such your Excellency's suc­ 
cess vies with the mountains ! Your Excellency is (destined 
to be) successful. How can this poor servant of your Excel­ 
lency have the ability to dilate upon this topic ? The Vazir 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 441 
was extremely pleased to hear these tidings, (and said) His 
Excellency is truly an incarnation of God. How can a human 
l)eing praise Him sufficiently ? Your humble servant (i.e. I) 
bas no other safe shelter anywhere except at your feet. If 
your Honour is likely to encamp at Lahore I will come there 
with the Emperor and his Vazir. The Vazir and all others, 
•great and small, fear that in case your Excellency were not 
to encamp, the Pathans are likely to return to Lahore in the 
rainy season. I have just set down here what the people, 
say. Your Honour's is the right to decide upon the course of 
action to be followed. May Your Excellency be kind enough 
to let this humble servant know whether the proposal of 
bringing the Vazir and the Emperor there is fair or other­ 
wise, and Your Excellency's orders in this respect are 
awaited. Vithhal Shivadev would escort them there if Your 
Honour so pleases. Krishnarao (Kale), too, might come, and 
put before Your Honour everything" (5.5. 1758)". 
T H E R E P O R T O N T H E C O N Q U E S T O F T H E 
PUNJAB SENT BY RAGHUNATHRAO 
PESHVA HIMSELF 
1071. Now letters after letters followed in quick succes- 
:sion from Shreemant Nanasahib at Poona asking Raghunath­ 
rao -to return along with his army to the South before the 
monsoons set in". But as the Punjab had been very recently 
conquered it was absolutely essential that proper systems 
had to be urgently laid down for the governance and admi­ 
nistration of the vast territory. As such it was desirable that 
Raghunathrao should entrench himself there with all his 
army for another four months. All the ablest Maratha 
leaders and army commanders thought and urged that 
Raghunathrao had better not go to the Deccan along with 
Malharrao HolKar"". But Raghunathrao Dada and Malharrao 
Holkar, too, were, in their heart of hearts inclined to go to 
the South. Now that Nanasahib had 'called' him back, 
Raghunathrao himself sent an authentic report"^, penned 
by himself, to Shreemant Nanasahib about the unpereced- 
442 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
ented success in the Punjab, and began his return march 
towards Poona. Many other Maratha Sardars, including the 
one of the status of Malharrao Holkar, returned to the Deccan 
along with Raghunathrao"*. Of course, in order to maintain 
the Maratha rule unhampered in the Punjab the requisite 
Maratha forces were stationed at different places by 
Raghunathrao under some Sardars. 
1072. Although it was quite possible to describe the 
valour of the Marathas in this campaign in the Punjab in the 
grand style of an epic or heroic poetry, Raghunathrao, 
however, it is especially to be noted, put the whole thing in- 
the report he sent of this campaign to Poona in the most 
direct matter-of-fact way, befitting his soldier's profession, 
without any long-winded digressions or self-adulation or- 
exaggeration of any sort. Hence we should like to cite his- 
very words. 
1073. Writes Raghunathrao in his despatch of the 4th 
May, 1758 to the Peshwa : "As regards the bandobasta, of" 
(resettling the affairs or re-establishing firm control over) the 
provinces, the Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and rest of the- 
territory this side of Attock, I should like to say that a part 
of the work is done and rest of it I shall do very shortly. 
After hotly pursuing Sultan Taimur and Jahankhan, we have 
routed and plundered all their army. Fighting some- 
skirmishes here and there and being beaten, they have fled- 
to Peshawar beyond Attock. Abdali marched against Iran 
but the Persian emperor despoiled his whole army. Abdali; 
then came (back) to Kandahar, followed by the Irani army 
in hot pursuit. Jabardestakhan and Muk-r-rubkhan, the- 
Sardars and Landlords of this province, who had tendered- 
their loyalties to Abdali because of the latter's threatening 
might (or tyrannical treatment), have also now changed their 
side and are promising to serve faithfully and to chastise 
Abdali. Abdali himself has lost courage. In short it does 
not seem that he can muster strong from that front. He has 
been, already, chastised by the Shah of Iran on the other 
side. It would be proper if you send reinforcements and 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 
establish His Majesty's control beyond Attock. His nephew 
and heir to the throne, who had approached Your Excellency 
and whom Your Excellency had sent to us will be given 
some territory this side of Attock to establish himself and 
then will be appointed to the Subha of Kabul, Peshawar 
beyond Attock. The chief of Abdali's forces, Abdul 
Samadkhan, who was in Sirhind is captive of our state- 
I shall send him and some Moghal and Irani forces from this 
province. They will manage the affairs there. By virtue of 
Your Excellency's greatness and piety they will bring 
pressure on Abdali and punishing him severely they will 
establish our control beyond Attock. Renake Anaji and 
Rayaji Sakhadev have been posted in Lahore. Gopal Ganesh 
(Barve) also is quite at home in this region, he, too, will 
stay. The Emperor of Iran had sent letters to me and to- 
Malharrao (Holkar) calling us precipitately to Kandahar to- 
destroy him (Abdali; and to fix up the frontier, at Attock.. 
But we, at least, on our part should like to send Abdul- 
Rahimankhan of Kabul, whom Your Excellency had sent to 
us, and we shall help him with some armed forces and other- 
sinews of war. The provinces of Kabul and Kandahar,, 
beyond Attock have been a part of Hindustan from (the- 
times of) Akbar to (that of) Alamgir; why should we then- 
give these away ? For the present we shall establish Irani 
control over the region and send a pleasant reply- 
Ambassadors from all the neighbouring powers like Jammu 
and Kashmir have come. We shall settle about the territory 
this side of Attock; further beyond it is not yet possible- 
(to do anything of the kind). Efforts (in that direction) wilt 
be made. For the present I shall do whatever is most urgent. 
Whoever stronger person will lead the next expedition will 
effect a permanent settlement. The province has a revenue- 
collection of about two to four crores (twenty to forty million, 
of rupees). But the landlords and jamindars are very powerful. 
We collect only a nominal revenue. It is difficult to realise- 
even two hundred thousand rupees from a province with a. 
yield of at least two and a half million. For the present we^ 
444 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
are staging a come-back, under Your Excellency's orders. As 
such we do whatever is possible; we do not stretch matters 
too far. For the time being the governance of the territory 
-has been entrusted at Adina Beg alone. To him we have 
given Lahore and Multan on lease. This year the whole (of 
the revenue collection) will be consumed by the occupation 
army; (garrison army) even fitting out such an occupation 
army will be diffilcult; things would be favourable after two or 
three years. With compliments to Your Excellency ! 
1074. THE ONLY DISGRACEFUL PART OF IT IS 
THAT WHILE RETURNING TO THE DECCAN THE 
M A R A T H A S D I D N O T T A K E R E V E N G E O N T H E M U S L I M S 
FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION ! 
1074-A. In Chapter 8, on the 'Perverted conception of 
virtues', of the book, it has already been shown in greater 
•detail how the Hindu Society (of the time) was haunted by 
a false and perverted sense of virtues and as such how the 
Hindus did not even slightly avenge the unbearable and un­ 
limited persecution and the diabolic atrocities perpetrated by 
the Muslims on the Hindu religion. Unlike Spain, Portugal, 
Bulgaria, Greece and other (European) nations which saved 
•Christianity from extinction (from their lands) by ridding 
•completely their homeland of Muslims, the H i n d u s d i d not 
•extirpate the Muslims from India. They refrained from 
inflicting similar, not to speak of greater, atrocities even on 
the enemy like the Muslims who considered religious 
persecution and diabolic and heinous atrocities themselves 
to be their religious duties ! Every drop of blood in the 
Hindu veins and arteries was surcharged, as it were, with 
the false and suicidal and perverted conception of religious 
tolerance towards the aliens. The notion that whatever the 
nature of atrocities of the aliens on our religion, we should 
not, even for resisting them, retaliate against these very 
aggressive alien religionists, was the essence of their religious 
tolerance. And it was considered by the Hindus to be their 
religion ! It is because of this suicidal notion of religious 
tolerance that Hindus, even when they had gained unparal- 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 445 
lelled victories over the Muslims on the battlefields and in 
the political arena, did not oppose them in the least on the 
religious front. Naturally on this religious front the Muslims 
in India were not extirpated, nor were they subdued. Root 
them out completely the Hindus never did ! as they had 
done with the Greeks, the Sakas, the Huns and other ancient 
aggressors ! 
1074-B. I should be failing in my duty if I were to 
proceed without referring to one more illustration of this 
incurable disease of the Hindu mind—of this perverted sense 
of virtues—which has proved highly injurious to the Hindu 
cause. This incident happened at a time when the Hindu 
valour and Hindu political victory had reached its zenith in 
the Punjab. 
1075. Just at the time when Raghunathrao had started 
from Poona with his army and reached Indore round about 
14th February, 1757, the malevolent Abdali had heaped untold 
humiliation and outrage on the Hindu religion and Hindu 
women. He had sent some of the cruellest of his commanders 
to Mathura, Vrindavan, Kurukshetra and other Hindu holy 
places, in order to avenge their rescue by the Marathas from 
the Emperor's clutches. Abdali had given these Muslim 
commanders strict orders that— 
1076. It was their religious duty as true Muslims that 
they should devastate every one of the so-called Hindu holy 
places like Mathura and massacre as many Hindus there as 
was possible, and to heap up the chopped-off heads together. 
Whoever from amongst them would chop off the heads of the 
Hindus as those of Kafirs, were to be rewarded by Abdali at 
the rate Rs. 5 per such Hindu head"'". 
1077. How mercilessly those savage Muslim wolves, 
instigated by Abdali's orders, attacked Mathura and other 
holy places of the Hindus has been described in paragraphs 
1059 and 1060. Accordingly the Muslims fell upon the 
Hindu religious centres at Mathura and slaughtered the 
innocent Hindus there. Gigantic Hindu temples toppled 
down one after another. Streams of blood of the Hindu 
446 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
-men and women, children and old people, began to flow 
through every house and every street. Not a single young 
-Hindu woman escaped kidnapping. Not a single cow was 
spared her life. The innocent blood of the cows, too, flowed 
like water. Those Muslim demons were neither satisfied with 
nor tired of this brutality. On the contrary in order to 
adorn these devilish acts of theirs with their diabolic 
artistic sense they travestied the ceremoney of the Hindu 
Rangpanchami, which happened to be at that time. And 
how? Big cauldrons and vessels full of Hindu blood newly 
shed were kept at different places at short intervals, and 
the Muslim soldiers with large syringes in hand went on 
•drenching the Hindus in every street and every home in 
their own blood"*. The same was the miserable fate of the 
next town of Gokul Vrindavan. But the moment he got the 
news that Raghunathrao had left Indore and proceeded with 
•a large army to destroy him, that self-styled Shahenshah, 
Abdali, hurried for life to Delhi with all his army and 
thence to Lahore and onwards straight to Kabul ! 
1078. Although the very same Maratha force whicb had 
beaten back Abdali's army straight beyond the (North- 
"West) frontier (of India) were now returning to the Deccan 
after their glorious victories in the Punjab and wer e visiting 
the same holy places of Mathura, (wrongly) spelt Mattra, 
•CHI (1939) and by other writers, Gokul Vrindavan, and 
while they were performing their religious rites and having 
ceremonial baths in the holy rivers, while again they were 
listening to the harrowing accounts of the Muslim atrocities 
on the Hindus and their religion, perpetrated only a year 
ago, while still the Hindu blood spilled profusely by the 
Muslims on the well-built banks (EJIS ghats) of the Jamuna 
at Mathura had not yet completely dried away, while again 
the ditches filled with the beef of cows (slain by the Muslims) 
had been putrefying along the streets, the heads of this 
Maratha army were not excited with anger at these Muslim 
brutalities ! Nobody of them was beside himself with shame 
and indignation 1 None of them was infuriated and none of 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 447 
them vowed revenge of this religious persecution ! The 
victorious general of the Hindus, the brave Raghunathrao, 
did not issue any order to his army to the effect that they 
should retaliate with the same atrocities on the Muslims as 
were indulged in by the latter, that the Muslims as a 
whole were to be slaughtered, that just like (the ruined) 
heaps of the Hindu temples, the Muslim Masjids should be 
pulled down without any exception, that the Muslim women 
should be put to the same indescribable humiliation and 
shame as the Hindu women folk were done by the Muslims; 
that it was their duty to take such a revenge for the wrongs 
done to Hindu religion and Hindu society ! Abdali had 
but done it I! 
1079. We have explained the inestimable wrong done 
to the Hindu society by this suicidal disease of the perverted 
conception of virtues so fully in Chapter 8 of this book that 
it is needless to repeat it here again. We hereby urge 
upon every reader to read the abovementioned Chapter 8 
over and over again and very carefully. 
1080. The most fortunate thing for the Hindus was only 
this that the catastrophe, which threatened to extinguish 
very flame of life of the whole Hindu nation, as a consequence 
of the silly Hindu religious notions (as the ones described 
above), was averted by their retaliatory deeds of valour and 
more especially by those of the Marathas on the political 
and military fronts. Although the Marathas are guilty of 
not taking revenge of the Muslim vandalism on Mathura- 
Vrindavan while on their triumphal march from the Punjab, 
the glorious victory that they won on the Muslims in the 
Punjab in this continuous millennial Hindu-Muslim war and 
the terrible blow that they gave to the Muslim imperial 
power establishing the independence of the Hindu nation 
and their own political hegemony in the north in-capacita­ 
ted the Muslims from completely destroying the Hindus in 
India, just as they had completely annihilated the other 
ancient nations in Asia. Babylon became Baghdad, but 
Mathura could not be transformed into another Mecca ! 
448 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Fighting incessantly and indefatigably for ten long centuries 
Mathura still exists as a holy Hindu place. The traces of 
Muslim domination have been wiped out I From the millions 
of Hindu throats the triumphant chants of the divine valour 
of Shree Krishna still resound the Ghats of Jamuna and 
all the temples unmitigated ! CHAPTER XXII

(Of what calibre were the Sardars under (him) ? Some were veritable lions, others were tigers whereas some others were rhinoceroses indeed ! Why, within a quarter of a 'Ghataka' (a period of 24 minutes) they planted their flags in Attock ! 
1082. As has been told In the previous chapter, while Raghunathrao was returning to the Deccan after his unpre­ cedented triumph in the Punjab, along with his numerous Sardars and warriors, the tidings of his victory had already been reaching Maharashtra from time to time. One day all the Maratha forces gathered together at Indore, the next day they were collecting the chauth and Sardeshmukhi taxes from all over Rajputana; later on they were reported to be rushing into the Antarvedi, punishing the Rohillas and Pathans for joining hands with Abdali; then conquering Delhi and performing the obsequies, as it were, of the vaunted imperial authority of Abdali and releasing the Moghal empe­ ror from his captivity and establishing him on the throne of Delhi as the puppet in Maratha hands; then again immedi­ ately invading the Punjab routing Abdali's Afghan army of ten thousand strong, which was kept there for the protection of the Punjab at Sirhind. Then Abdali's son Taimurshah and his genera] Jahankhan were reported to have fled from the Marathas without giving any battle, and fled straight to Kabul leaving Lahore to the tender care of the Marathas, and the armies of Raghunathrao were said to be mopping up the Punjab clean of the Afghan domination and driving the 
450 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
enemy far beyond Attock. Then came the news of the 
triumphant entry of Raghunathrao into Lahore I With such 
heartening news and reports pouring in daily of the Maratha 
victories and the worsting of the enemies at their hands, the 
mighty heart of Maharashtra was filled with justifiable pride. 
Raghunathrao had already earned for himself a name fit to 
be ranked with the greatest in the world in his single victo­ 
rious campaign right from Poona straight to the Indus ! The 
whole of Maharashtra began to call him, willingly or unwill­ 
ingly, but lovingly enough Ragho-Bharari,^ in order to express 
its wonder and pride about this unhampered and undeterred 
spring of his, about this eagle-flight of his, towards the 
Himalayas ! This informal title of the victorious general, 
Raghunathrao, has become immortal 1 
SOON ARRIVED THE NEWS OF THE CROWNING 
GLORY OF THE MARATHAS 
1083. Raghunathrao, the commander-in-chief of the 
Maratha forces, had posted some of the Maratha Sardars to 
punish severely all the Muslim Emirs, Umraos, gangsters and 
marauders, fakirs and parasites of every sort who were creat­ 
ing anarchical conditions in the Punjab and especially 
towards the Indus Valley plundering the peaceful populace 
there, and establish the Maratha hold in that territory firmly 
and to collect the revenue and the 'chauth' and 'Sardesh­ 
mukhi' taxes from the territory. Of those Sardars, Tukoji 
Holker, Sabaji Shinde, Gopalrao Barve with their soldiers 
attacked the fort of Attock, which was the pride of the Indus 
valley, and snatched it away from the Muslim hands in the 
month of July 1758*. The Muslim green flag was uprooted and 
inits place was hoisted in the tumultuous war-cries of 'Har Har 
Mahadev !' of the Marathas, the saffron-coloured 'Jaripatka' 
of the Hindus—on the fort of Attock'. The Maratha—and 
so the Hindu—horse once again drank the holy waters of 
the Indus ! 
1084. On that glorious day at last was the ban (Atak— 
gjz^) of a thousand years enforced by the religious law of 
STH GLORIOUS EPOCH 451 
the Hindus themselves broken by the Hindu arms ! Why, 
the Maratha warriors pursued the Muslims even beyond 
Attock upto Kandahar ! 
1085. It is already explained in paragraphs 522 to 535 
how this town was named 'Attock' and why. 
1086. When the news arrived in Maharashtra of the 
•conquest of Attock and of the hoisting by the Marathas of 
the Hindu Jaripatka on that fort the universal joy felt there 
knew no bounds. The Marathas had taken revenge of the 
wrongs done to the Hindus over a thousand years by routing 
and driving the Muslims right upto Kabul and Kandahar 
and wrenching the de facto sovereignty of the whole of India 
from the Muslim hands. 
AND THIS ITSELF IS THE FIFTH GLORIOUS EPOCH 
OF HINDU VICTORIES OVER THE AGGRESSORS 
1087. The page in the history of the Hindu nation which 
records this unique event of the conquest of Attock and the 
final victory of the Hindus in the epic millennial Hindu- 
Muslim war and the establishment of the defacto sovereignty 
of the Hindus over the so-called Muslim empire is really the 
Golden Page in Hindu history and that day is truly the Red 
Letter Day in the life of Hindu nation ! 
HOWEVER 
1088. Just as a man on his death-bed, too, breathes a little longer and sometimes even makes a violent effort to rise in epileptic fits, but dies at last; or just as the whole body of the enormously long snake, twenty feet or more in length, gigantic in thickness vying with the broad trunks of the Vat (Indian fig-Ficus Indica) tree, moving dangerously at large in the forests, does not lie lifeless all at once in a moment, even if its head has been smashed completely, but keeps on moving convulsively and even at times seeks to leap ahead, yet ultimately the dying body does die at last; similarly in spite of the fact that the Marathas had smashed the head of the M u s l i m imperial power and left it gasping 
452 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
for its last breath on the battle-fields of the Indus valley, the 
moribund Muslim power did continue to make feverish efforts 
to rise again here and there for some time more; that dying 
body did in fact take a long leap like that of Panipat, but 
ultimately it could not avert its fast approaching death. 
1089. And in the end throughout the whole of India 
began to flutter the flag of independent Hindu power ! Not. 
alone from the Indus but right from the banks of the Kabul 
river, spread throughout the whole of the Punjab, upto the 
frontiers of Jammu and Kashmir, was established the Hindu;- 
Sikh empire of Maharana Ranjitsingh ! Further on, from 
Delhi right up to Rameshwaram in the rest of India was esta­ 
blished the paramountcy of the Marathas, and to the north 
was the independent Hindu State of Nepal !!! Thus every­ 
where in India began to rule once again the Hindu political 
power : the Muslim power could not recover its fall ! 
1090. That is why it must be said that on the day on 
which the Marathas uprooted and flung away the green flag 
of the Muslim political dominance from the fort of Attock. 
and hoisted in its place their own triumphant saffron colour­ 
ed Jaripatka, the Hindus gave a really mortal blow to the 
Muslim power in India and caused its subsequent death ! 
1091. Even a historian like Sardesai, who was wont to 
make under-statements, wrote; 'AH Maharashtra felt electri­ 
fied with the proud performance of Raghunathrao and his 
bands having reached the extreme frontier of India and 
bathed their horses in the Indus". (New History of Maha­ 
rashtra : Vol. II Page. 401)«. 
1092. As soon as the reports of the final victories of the 
Hindus over the Muslims in this millennial Hindu-Muslim 
War reached Maharashtra, the Charans, the Bhats, the Gond- 
halees, who were the chief exponents of the poignant nation­ 
al feelings of the people at large began to surcharge the 
atmosphere of every village in Maharashtra with triumphant 
joy by means of their heroic poems and ballads, imbued with 
the most warlike spirit. There was not to be found any self- 
respecting Maratha who was not enthralled and inspired to 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 463 
hear these heroic deeds of his own arnly. Since it is only in the imaginative vein that a true picture of the romantic mood of the Maharashtra of that day can be drawn, I have tried to express it in my poem Gomantak through the mouth of Maharashtrabhat, a typical representative of the Bhats, Charans and Gondhalees ! A few couplets from the same poem are translated into English from the original in Marathi and cited here for the perusal of the reader* !

THE SIXTH GLORIOUS EPOCH OF HINDU 
VICTORIES OVER THE AGGRESSORS

1094. This chapter on the Sixth Glorious Epoch of Hindu Victories Over Aggressors is the last one. 
1094-A. The scope of this book has been defined in paragraph 7 of the first chapter of this book. That delimita­ tion itself suggests that in this chapter on the Sixth Glorious Epoch of Hindu victories it is not at all necessary to give a detailed account of how, while the British had firmly establi­ shed their mighty empire on the whole of India, the H i n d u nation could make itself independent and how it has taken a place of pride as an independent and sovereign republic amongst the nations of the world. The only object of this chapter is just to examine and assess only salient points in this exciting war of liberation of the Hindu nation with the British which have been purposely overlooked by almost all the foreign as well as the independent historians, notwith­ standing the fact that they are highly important from the point of view of Hindutwa. 
1095. But that too I have done for the most part in my 
456 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
other books, as far as it was necessary to do so : 
1096. (1) It is already mentioned at the end of the 
last chapter that the Hindus had completely uprooted the 
foreign Muslim empire from India and Hindu States had, 
once again, been established everywhere and the Muslims did 
not, in fact, wield any imperial authority over the land of 
Hindustan. But while the Hindu nation was thus inextricably 
involved in a gigantic millennial war to root out the Muslim 
imperial power from India and while all its energies and time 
were utilized in that direction, European nations like the 
"Portuguese, the French, the Dutch and especially the English 
had already commenced their efforts at establishing their 
rule over India secretly or even openly. The Marathas who 
had assumed the leadership of the Hindu nation at that time 
had simultaneously to face all these European nations just 
when they were carrying on a life and death struggle with 
the Muslims ! Although they had been mostly successful in 
the end in arresting the progress of the Portuguese, the 
French, the Dutch and the English, however, shrewdly availed 
themselves of the opportunity, they got, when the Marathas 
were engaged in the struggle with the Muslim powers, and 
gradually but firmly established their foot-hold in the Bengal 
trampling under their feet the weaker Muslim Nawabs over 
there. Thereafter they pushed on their aggressive moves and 
established, though not de jure yet de facto, sovereignty over 
the territory right upto Delhi. N a t u r a l l y they soon came to 
grips with the Marathas, who had to lead the Hindu nation at 
that time. In my book, Hindu Patpadshahi (originally written 
in English and now translated into Marathi) I have sufficiently 
discussed, from the standpoint of the Hindu nation, how and 
to what extent the Marathas worsted the English during the 
First and the Second Anglo-Maratha Wars^. The curious 
readers should do well to read it. 
1097. That discussion will make the following two 
broad points absolutely clear. The first is that from the 
time the English stepped on the Indian soil the Muslims 
never fought with them for national political independence. 
6tH GLORIOUS EPOCH 457 
With the short exception of those with the Mysore State of 
Haidar and Tipu, ail the wars, which the English fought for 
the sovereignty over India, had to be necessarily fought with 
the Hindus alone. This clearly shows that the Hindus had 
practically destroyed the political power oft he Muslims and 
had snatched the imperial authority. Another equally 
important point to be remembered is that the English, too, 
had maintained the nominal dignity of the puppet Moghal 
Emperor for fifty years after they had established their de 
facto sovereign power over India in the very same manner 
as the Marathas had, as a political expedient of the time 
kept on recognizing the same 'king of shreds and patches' as 
the 'Emperor of India'. 
1098. It again exposes the snobbery and ignorance of 
the Anglicized people who ridicule the Marathas for this 
•'political expedient' of theirs, of a nominal recognition of the 
Moghal Emperor. For the English, too, found the same 
political expedient useful to them. These Anglicized people 
however do not criuicize the English for this same 'weakness' 
of theirs I 
THE ANGLO-SIKH WARS 
1099, No sooner did the English destroy the sovereign 
Maratha power over India in A.D. 1818 and no sooner did 
they force the rest of the Maratha states to accept their 
overlordship than they had to cross swords with another 
new-born Hindu power. That Hindu power was the great 
kingdom of Maharaja Eanjitsing which rose to prominence 
after 1818. It was after the death of Maharaja Ranjitsing 
that the English took the field against the combined Hindu 
might of the Sikhs, the Jats and the Dogras spread far and 
•wide from the river Kabul to the river Shatadru (Sutlej) and 
to the north upto Kashmir and Ladakh. In the end the 
English were successful and the English sovereignty was 
established from the Punjab to Kashmir round about 
A . D . 1850«.

THAT WAS DESTROYED 
1100. As I have surveyed the period of Indian History 
covered by the Maratha Empire, in my English book Hindu 
Patpadshahi, similarly I had written a discourse on the- 
period following the Maratha epoch in that book of mine, the 
History of the Sikhs, written in Marathi. But while I was 
in the thick of revolutionary political activities against the 
English in Paris, round about 1909-10, the manuscript of my 
book* 'The History of the Sikhs' fell into the hands of Govern­ 
ment of India's Secret Intelligence Department and was, 
destroyed before publication. However, in my books 
"Prushthabhumi" and this one "Six Glorious Epochs of 
Hindu Victories Over Aggressors"' I have discussed from the 
Hindu standpoint all the important events in the Sikh 
history upto 1850—the time when the mighty kingdom of 
the Sikhs was virtually destroyed ! The curious reader should 
read it. 
THE ANGLO-NEPALESE WAR 
1101. The third great power with which the English had' 
to fight for the sovereignty of India was the then mighty 
Hindu state of Nepal. Although the English ultimately won 
that war, their success was not so great as to destroy that- 
Nepalese Hindu State completely. Barring the English 
paramountcy as regards the external affairs, their interna] 
independence was unimpaired*. Again, this existence of the 
Nepalese Hindu State was essential for the continuance of 
the English sovereignty over India for a long time after­ 
w a r d s . F o r N e p a l w a s a f e r t i l e field w h i c h c e a s e l e s s l y 
provided staunch and brave Hindu Gurkha soldiers for the 
English army. This Hindu Gurkha army proved itself quite- 
capable of, not only in India, but also in Europe, successfully 
facing the even numbered white army of other European, 
countries. Moreover in the face of a plausible aggression 
from the mighty Empire of Russia, which was not only- 
capable but anxious to invade the northern frontiers of the 6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 
British Indian Empire, the English wished that the warlike 
state of Nepal should serve as a Buffer State in order that 
such a Russian aggression might not come too unexpectedly. 
1102. Only after defeating the three Hindu powers of 
the Marathas, the Sikhs and the Nepalese could the English 
claim complete sovereignty over India. 
1103. The scrambling little East India Company o f 
overseas traders in England, which was established round 
about the rise of Shivaji Maharaj and which had begun its- 
activities with two meagre factories at its disposal, went on, 
enlarging the sphere of activities and thus acquired the 
sovereignty of the whole of India about 1850 ! Originally 
started by about a dozen English men of pluck, the obscure- 
trading company thus became, within a short period of two, 
centuries or so, them istress of a mighty empire ! During the- 
same period rose and fell many royal dynasties vying with. 
one another for the sovereignty of India. Many sundry 
states were founded soon and found themselves engaged in. 
internecine warfare and destroyed. But ultimately it was- 
this East India Company which struggled and fought on and 
ultimately supplanted all those rival powers to become the- 
sole mistress of India. How very insignificant a commercial 
body was this East India Company on the day on which it. 
was started by a handful of shareholders I But all its yearly 
reports of its assets and liabilities, of its income and ics- 
expenditure, right from its first year of inception to the year 
of its dissolution, carrying forward its previous year's- 
balance and new sources of income and new items of expendi­ 
ture every year, till after a hundred and fifty or two hundred, 
years it came to include towards its credit side the very, 
empire of India, had all been very scrupulously and system­ 
atically preserved in its secretariat in London. And when 
in 1858 it was dissolved and the British Government itself 
took over the Empire of India in the name of Queen Victoria, 
it was most systematically and legally wound up like any- 
commercial or professional concern paying every shareholder 
his dues as per its last balance-sheet of that year and after- 
460 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
paying off all other liabilities* ! 
1104. This continuous process of British administra­ 
tion, this neatness and precision in its work, its capacity to 
organize and govern, to run a vast and complicated 
administration, shine all the more gloriously when contrasted 
w i t h the confused way of doing things, prevalent i n our 
country at that time, our lack of order, political instability 
•and our complete disregard for well-organized work ! 
Although it is unjustifiable to show the similarity and 
difference between the British nation and our own, as they 
at the time were, by such a solitary and comparatively insig­ 
nificant instance as this, it may still serve as a pointer—and 
a very effective pointer at that—-to show how the once petty 
East India Company could become in the end the Honourable 
Company Sarkar Bahadur which ran the imperial administra­ 
tion of India*. 
1105. Although the total defeat of our Hindu nation 
-at the hands of the British had always been rankling in our 
hearts like a deep-rooted and envenomed arrow, we had 
never repudiated it or glossed over it, not even detracted 
from the victory of the British people over us by scolding 
-and railing at them under false pretexts. For, we had the 
•courage and ability which had never died away to avenge 
that defeat of our Hindu nation. On the contrary we 
•sincerely believed that in this bitter war between the Hindu 
and the British nations it was on the whole natural that the 
British who were at that time superior to us in the art of 
war and strength, should succeed over us. We knew that 
the success or defeat on the battlefields never obeyed the 
•dictates of the code of justice or injustice. 
1106. For this reason, as soon as the British imperial 
power was established in India the innermost heroic spirit 
in the country took up the gauntlet to vanquish the British 
nation on the battlefield itself by resorting to some 
Nrusinhian act of aggressive heroism. 
1107. After the British snatched away the imperial 
authority from its hands the defeated Hindu nation lay for 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 461 
some time dazed and pale-faced. Even the volcano lies dead and cold for some time after every eruption. But unless that particular eruption is its last, the terribly explosive substances in its womb smouldering inwardly become unbearably hot. Similarly the Hindu nation was merely defeated by the British—it was not yet dead. As such in its mighty heart there soon began to seethe and smoulder the explosive elements of many valiant souls in order to go full tilt once again against the victorious English ! 
(OUTBURST) 
THE FmST GREAT INDIAN BOMBARDMENT 
AGAINST THE BRITISH REGIME 
1108. Hardly a daeade elapsed after the British had 
conquered the last Hindu State of Eanjitsing in the Punjab 
when there was a great outburst of Hindu-Muslim joint 
effort to uproot the British imperial power from India. 
A n d t h e r e flared u p t h e first c o n f l a g r a t i o n o f t h e w a r o f 
Independence against the British in 1857 !!! 
1109. The one remarkable aspect of this revolutionary 
war was that the Hindus and the Muslims had organized 
themselves into a joint national front and waged a nation­ 
wide war against the British, forgetting their age-long enmity 
of centuries together ! 
1110. But I have already written some time in 1908- 
1909 a detailed history of this revolutionary war in my book 
o f a b o u t five h u n d r e d p a g e s n a m e d , " I n d i a n W a r o f 
Independence of 1857". In it I have reviewed that war 
from the standpoint of the Hindu nation. As such it is not 
necessary to repeat the same here again. 
1111. During those two or three years of this war of 
Independence the English suffered such heavy losses that 
the English casualties far outnumbered those suffered by 
them in all their wars with the Marathas, the Sikhs and the 
Nepalese taken together, for the sovereignty of India. The 
•462 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
brave revolutionists killed so many British warriors and 
white men ! Let alone the petty English captains, lieuten­ 
ants, collectors, Magistrates and such like second-grade 
oflScers, but such eminent personalities like General White, 
General Neill, Sir Henry Lawrence, General Outram, 
Commander-in-Chief Anson and others too had to pay the 
penalty with their lives. The revolutionaries dispatched 
most of them on the battlefield ! The English too killed 
n e a r l y a h u n d r e d t h o u s a n d fighters f r o m a m o n g s t t h e 
revolutionaries, as per the statement of Nanasahib Peshwa, 
the leader of that revolution' ! 
1112. At the end of this revolutionary war the British 
terminated 'The Honourable East India Company' which 
was to the revolutionaries a virtual British Government, and 
which they hated for the same reason. The British thought 
that the abolition of 'The East India Company' and its rule 
would pacify the Indian revolutionaries in as much as their 
wishes had been honoured in this respect I So the British 
Government proclaimed it with all the fanfare and grandiose 
display, that the administration of India had been taken 
over from the East India Company and that the latter had 
been dissolved and further that the British Queen, Victoria, 
"would thereafter, take for herself the title. The Empress of 
India,' assuming full sovereign power over the country. Thus 
the clash of arms on the battlefield, by the Indian revolu­ 
tionists for about three years had put an end to the hated 
'East India Company'. 
1113. Over and above this the British issued throughout 
India a proclamation in the name of the new Empress of 
India, Victoria, the Queen of England, in which, for the sake 
of the revolutionists and with a view to pacifying them a bit, 
it was said that after the issue of that proclamation, which 
of the 'mutineers' would stop fighting openly or covertly and 
return to their homes never to harass the English people and 
would begin living a peaceful life, would be shown, without 
exception, royal clemency, irrespective of anything they 
might have done in respect of the 'mutiny'*. 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 463 
1114. After the British had thus surrendered, though 
not explicitly yet doubtless implicitly, to the revolutionists 
in respect of the abovementioned two points, there was 
included in the said proclamation of the new Empress of 
India a further important promise that neither the British 
Government, nor any local white-skinned ofiScer, nor even any 
British missionary would be suffered to interfere with the 
religion of the 'natives', that the Empress of India wished to 
treat all her subjects, the Hindus, the Muslims, the Christians 
and others, impartially and that she, as the Empress of India, 
would protect every religion from the tyrannical persecution 
at the hands of every other religion". This express promise 
was included in this famous proclamation in order to 
eradicate one of the most potent causes of the outbreak of 
the War of Independence, namely, the Indian apprehension 
that the company's government was out to destroy the 
native religions and to convert all the Indians to Christianity 
with the use of force. And this, too, was a tacit submission 
of the British to the revolutionists ! 
1115. Yet another important submission was implicitly 
made to the revolutionists in this proclamation. It was the 
discontinuation of the obnoxious practice^'- of denying the 
Indian rulers the right of adoption and liquidating and 
annexing their territories to the British possessions in 
India. For, it was expressly promised in the said proclama­ 
tion that the traditional right of the Indian rulers to adopt 
heirs to their estates would be honoured. Their adopted 
heirs were promised the same political and administrative 
rights as they enjoyed under the old tradition. 
1115-A. Thus the British had tried by means of this 
Queen's proclamation to remove almost all the causes, which 
in their opinion, had led to the horrible revolt of the Indian 
revolutionists. Nevertheless the most important promise—of 
course in the British opinion—and the one which they 
thought would give complete satisfaction to the Indian 
people—was that— 
1116. All the Indian subjects of Queen Victoria would 
464 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
be treated as respectfully as the British;—and that they 
would be selected for appointment to all the official posts in 
the British empire irrespective of caste, creed or religion^* !! 
1116-A. B U T T H I S P R O C L A M A T I O N H A D N O 
EFFECT WHATSOEVER UPON THE REVOLUTIONISTS ! 
1117. Why, a parallel proclamation was issued by the 
revolutionists as a pungent and trenchant rejoinder to the 
Queen's Proclamation" ! How appropriate and poignant it 
was has already been clearly shown in my book, 'The Indian 
War of Independence of 1857'". The very basic statement 
made in it was that the revolutionary war that had been 
fought so far was not fought because they wanted the rule of 
the British East India Company over India to be replaced by 
that of the imperial authority of the British Queen". They 
did not want any foreign power—and certainly not that of 
the British—to dominate over India! They wanted a 
completely independent self-rule .' That is why, they said, 
they were fighting in the battlefields. Although the Queen's 
Proclamation was exhibited on every wall throughout India, 
thousands of revolutionists, including General Totya Tope, 
Shreemant Nanasahib, Balasahib, 'Jalka Rambhau', Amarsing, 
Ferozshah and other eminent leaders of the revolution kept 
on fighting for months together" ! Only after the heroic fall 
of almost all of them in the all-consuming flames of the 
revolution, fighting and fighting till the very last, could that 
sacrificial pit smoulder low and cool down subsequently ! 
HOWEVER ! 
1118. However, the last two, or three promises given 
in the 'Queen's Proclamation' did not fail to have the 
'desired' effect on the new generation of Indian people which 
was later on educated in the English schools and colleges 
that were shortly opened thereafter and on that of the 
thousands of Indian officers and servants which thrived on 
the Government salaries. Especially in Calcutta, Bombay, 
Madras and other cities where the illusory British reforms 
had already spread their cobwebs much earlier than 1857 the 
6TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 46& 
then Indian leaders were so much elated by the promise in 
the Queen's Proclamations that the British Empress would 
allow her British as well as Indian subjects to enjoy all 
civic rights equally and without any invidious distinction, 
that they declared, openly in the public meetings held to 
celebrate the total extinction of the 'mutiny', that now on 
the British empire belonged as much to the British as to the 
Indian people "I This Proclamation of the Queen was just 
another 'peaceful' device that the British had found out, as 
they had used the other one of 'violent repression', simply to 
put down the Indian revolutionaries. They had not the least 
intention to follow in future the political or administrative 
policy outlined in it This I have amply proved by quoting 
the words of the British statesmen themselves in my books 
written on later history". But the credulous and converted 
minds of the above-mentioned class of Indian people who 
were educated in 'English Schools' and who were earnestly 
busy serving their British masters could never grasp this 
secret and crooked ruse of the British diplomacy. On the 
contrary, being deluded by the preposterous Proclamation of 
the Queen, who, mad with victory, had the audacity to 
ascend to the imperial throne of India, these simple gulls of 
Indian leaders hastened to glorify that 'Proclamation' as the 
Indian Magna Carta in press and public meetings". How 
absurd and foolish it is to compare that original 'Magna 
Carta' in English history, with which the English people, 
after fighting successfully with their King, had forced him to 
concede to them their fundamental civic rights, with this 
deceitful and profane 'Proclamation of the Queen', which 
tightened the shackles of slavery on the Indian hands and 
feet even more forcibly than before, only gilding them 
outwardly so as to pass them on as ornaments. 
1119. But in my Background to my 'Autobiography' I 
have already dealt, at greater length, and from the point of 
view of the Indian people, with the period of Indian history, 
after the temporary pacification of the War of Liberation of 
1857 was achieved and the foundation of the British 
466 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
administration in India was firmly secured*". Hence it need not be repeated here ! 
THE PECULIAR CHARACTER OF THE PERIOD 
THE POLITICAL MOVEMENTS OF THE 
LOYALISTS 
1120. The peculiarity of the period following the pacifi­ 
cation of the national rising of 1857—i.e., roughly speaking 
from 1860 to 1900—is that it is dominated by a nation-wide 
movement under the leadership of those who believed that 
India would once again see national prosperity and develop­ 
ment only by remaining in the British empire and she must 
achieve it that way alone Hence this period can be 
generally called an age of the Loyalist politicians. How­ 
ever, even in this age of avowed loyal politicians the age-old 
tradition of heroism which vehemently advocated armed 
revolt to free the mother-land from British domination was 
not altogether extinct ! It did flare up secretly or even openly, 
in some daring risings I Even those momentary explosions of 
that traditional.[heroism did not fail to convulse the British 
administration in India and to excite and inspire the Indian 
people at least for the time being. Only two illustrations of 
these armed revolts would sufl&ce. The Hindu rising under 
the leadership of Ramsing Kuka** in the Punjab during 1870- 
74 A.D. against the British and the Muslims for political 
independence and for defending our religion is the chief of 
them. And the second, far more extensive and even more 
effective than the first, was the one in Maharashtra under 
the leadership of Vasudev Balwant Phadke*'. It was a 
violent armed revolt against the British for the complete 
independence of India ! These incidents, too, are reviewed in 
detail in the 'Background' to my 'Autobiography.' 
1121. Thereafter dawned the age of Lokmanya Tilak, 
which was synochronized by the lethal attacks of Chaphekar 
brothers on the English officers and the feverish activity of 
secret revolutionary societies for liberty. 
"fifH GLORIOUS EPeOH 467 
THE POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN INDIA A F T E R 1900 1122. At the end of 1900 or thereabouts terminated the 
•era of loyalist political movement and began the one of Lokmanya Tilak which might fittingly be called—though not revolutionary—conducive to revolution. To this very period were inextricably tied up in my very childhood from the time 
•of the martyrs, Chaphekar's sally at the British, my hearts ^strings** and later on my whole life was dedicated to that revolutionary activity. As such my life-history itself became 
•an extensive chapter in the war of liberation against the JEnglish. Naturally, whatever might be said about these ination-wide political activities during this period, from the point of view of Hindutwa, has already appeared in the written part of my 'Autobiography' or will perhaps in the 
•one which might be written hereafter. As such even when I 
•was in my teens I began to come in closer contacts with 
•almost all the elder reputed leaders of India in respect of this independence movement. 
1123. When I had been to England in my very young 
•days I had come in contact with the eldest of the Indian politicians of the time and the earliest founder of the loyalist political front, namely Dadabhai Nawroji, in his eighties. Why, there my rovolutionary party had to cross swords with his British-loyalist party in our tug-of-war for the leadership 
•of Indian political movement in England**. Next to him I had 
•developed in England itself closer relations with the respected staunch Bengali freedom fighters from amongst those belong­ ing to the generation following that of Dadabhai Nawroji, like the late Shree Surendranath Bannerjee, Romeshchandra Datta and others**. With most of the younger leaders of the same period belonging to the staunch nationalist party fighting vehemently against the loyalist front I had deve­ loped personal friendship and ideological kinship. With the active political workers from Pandit Shyamji Krishan Varma, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bipinchandra Pal, Right Honourable 
•Gokhale and such other all-India figures to hundreds of the 
468 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
leaders belonging to different provinces, I bad either deve­ 
loped friendly ties or had to fight political battles on many 
occasions. Lokmanya Tilak, Shivrampant Paranjpe, Shree­ 
mant Dadarao Khaparde, Dr. Moonjeand other Maharash- 
trian leaders of that line were individually so closely 
acquainted with me that some of them and the staunchi 
nationalist leaders from other provinces, too, bestowed 
parental affection on me*'. For example while Bipinchandra 
Pal was in England, I was staying with him for some time in 
company with his son, Niranjan Pal*'. Bipin Babu himself 
had more than once cooked fish and flesh in the Bengali 
style and had served them to me with great importunity and 
had added to his moral credit the meritorious act of polluting 
a strictly vegetarian Maharashtrian Brahmin like myself. 
With the future exponent of the 'non-violent truth-assertion'^ 
(Satyagrah), 'non-cooperation movement' who later on came 
to be widely known as Mahatmaji—I happened to be closely 
acquainted in a friendly way when he had come to England 
where he was then known simply as Barrister Gandhi*' and 
thereafter throughout our lives we came together and many 
times in conflict—in the political arena in India. And my 
relations with armed revolutionary party in India are too- 
well-known to be recounted here ! The All-India leadership' 
of the post-Chaphekar revolutionary activities had by chance 
devolved on me at least in the beginning—first in Maharashtra 
and thereafter in England". Need it be told that I had 
developed very close acquaintance with thousands of brave 
martyrs and gallant fighters of that party ? Shyamji Krishan 
Varma, Madam Cama, Barrister Rana and many other elder 
and eminent personalities were among those who were 
converted to our revolutionary views through my propaganda, 
and guidance*!. Thus I had very close contacts and personal 
friendship with various great personalities from all over 
India. To the thousands of members of my revolutionary 
secret society, the Abhinav Bharat Samastha, right from its 
original nucleus at Nasik and Bhagur to its innumerable 
branches in many foreign countries I had myself administered €TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 469 
the oath of allegiance in person. The martyr Madanlal Dhingra, Lala Hardayal, Bhai Parmanandji, Chattopadhyaya, Senapati Bapat, the great historian, D r . Jayaswal, Tiruma- lacharya, 'Rishi' Aiyar—how many names can one recount ? Thereafter when 1 was sent to the Andamans on transpor­ tation for life I had the company of Pulin Biharidas, the Chief of the Anushilan Samiti, Barindra Ghosh of Yugantar Samiti, Upendranath Bannerjee, Ashutosh Lahiri, Hemchan- dradas and other Bengali revolutionary conspirators, as fellow-convicts". Nearly a hundred or more Sikh and non- Sikh revolutionaries of the Gadar Party and other societies who were originally sentenced to death but whose sentence was, later on, commuted to deportation also came along with us to the Andamans to serve their terms and stayed therewith us suffering unbearable innumerable hardships and torture for years together for the sacred cause of the libera­ tion of our motherland. Subsequent to my release from the Andamans I again came into very intimate contact with the millions of the avowed believers in H i n d u t w a i n the great organizational movement for the solidarity of the Hindus as a staunch opposition to the fanatic Muslim activioies which was a natural concomitant to the armed revolutionary work against the British. For want of space it is impossible even to mention their names ! But a special request has to be made just here lest the omission of their names might be mis­ understood to be due to their work being less important in 
•comparison to that of the others whose names are herein mentioned. 
1124. Ever since the sixteenth year of my life—the time when I began to take part in politics—I have been personally and closely connected—at times as a vehement adversary—with all the above mentioned four phases of Indian political life—the Loyalists, the non-violent but vehemently nationalistic, the revolutionist and finally the Hinduistic—subsequent to the defeat in the war of Indepen­ dence of 1857. As such the compilation and interpretation from the Hindu standpoint of the history of the period has 
470 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTOR-f 
been fully done in my writings and speeches made on every- 
occasion during these fifty or sixty yeiars. Now I don't think: 
it necessary for me to add even a single word to the published^ 
work of mine running to about seven to eight thousand prin­ 
ted pages in the form of books or otherwise, leaving aside- 
hundreds of my speeches, interviews, articles and the written- 
work that is now lost beyond recovery and now at this age—- 
the eightieth year of my life—when I am confined to bed I 
have not the physical strength left in me to go on repeating: 
it once again ! 
CONCLUSION 
1125. During this ceaseless and relentless war with the- 
British which India had carried on so consistently and so 
resolutely with violent and non-violent means for more than a 
hundred years from its first volcanic eruption in 1857 to the 
year 1946—when the second World War had come to an end- 
in order that it might free itself from the tyrannical bonds of 
British slavery, our Hindu nation ultimately got the golden 
opportunity of achieving the greatest success as the war- 
drums began to thunder and rend the European skies !! 
1126. If we have received any real and effective help- 
from any nation it was from Hitler, the dictator of Germany 
and General Tojo, the militant leader of the Japanese ! It ife 
these countries, Germany and Japan, which gave substantial 
help in up-to-date arms and ammunition for the army, navy 
and airforce to the revolutionary party from the very begin­ 
ning, that is from the violent agitation in Europe by the- 
Abhinava Bharat Samstha" to the declaration of war agair.st 
the British by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in the second. 
World War. That is why an army of hardly forty to fifty 
thousand strong could rise in revolt against the British near- 
Malaya and Singapore and could march against India under 
Netaji Subhashbabu to free it with the war-cry 'Ch'alo- 
Delhi"'*. At the same time the British came to know that in 
India too the Indian army, navy and airforce under the 
British had hatched out a conspiracy to go in for a revolu- 
eXH GLORIOUS EPOCH 471 
tionary war of independence". Of the Indian citizens millions were just waiting to raise a standard of revolt against the British. Some had gone underground and begun subversive activities, while others openly raided the British armouries in surprise attacks and sacked them thoroughly; others still, started prototype governments and rooted out the British control over those particular regions. Thus harassed on all sides and paralysed by incessant fighting in the two world wars in Europe, the crippled and mutilated British power lost its hold on India. The English people had lost the vigour and strength needed to hold the empire in fee ! At last in 1947 the British Viceroy began talks with the Indian leaders saying that they would recognize Indian independence and leave it and go back'*. 
1127. Of course, the British naturally recognized those political parties alone as the leaders of India that were originally labouring under misconceptions and delusion as regards their political theories, were generally chicken-hearted and pro-British on the whole, frightened of the Muslims and still very eager to have anyhow, by fair means or foul, what­ ever little political power they could grab, and with them alone they carried out all their talks on the transfer of power" ! These parties, too, no doubt, were patriotic in their actions; they, too, had laboured for the cause of freedom constitutionally and non-violently. 
1128. But the British had laid down one crafty and far more dangerous condition. The British statesmen insisted that India be vivisected into two because they wanted to re­ ward those Muslims who had consistently and treacherously helped the British throughout the Indian War of Liberation ever since 1857, and who demanded a unified state of the Muslim-majority provinces cut out from the rest of India, as a price for that help. The British statesmen conceded to this anti-Hindu, highly perfidious and anti-national demand of the Muslims with a still deeper and more sinister motive of creating an everlasting enemy for the Hindu nation". 
1129. This insistence of the British was basically the 
472 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
Muslim demand for a separate sovereign state over the Muslim-majority provinces, which had been supported quite vehemently by all the Muslims in India. But all the Hindus in India, strongly enough, did not oppose this Muslim demand for a Pakistan so vehemently ! With only one excep­ tion, all the political parties in India were for granting the Muslims Pakistan, and ending the strife for ever". It meant that the whole of the Punjab and the Bengal should be ceded to Pakistan*". Over and above this the Muslims demanded a corridor to connect their two Muslim states of the Punjab and the Bengal, a strip of land right from the Punjab to Bengal through the heart of North India !! 
1130. The only party which staunchly and consistently opposed theseMuslim demands throughout India was avowedly a pro-Hindu party ! Under the leadership of the Hindu Maha- sabha these Hindus started an all-India agitation against the vivisection of India, and protested against it as bitterly as possible". The anti-Hindu elements, the Muslims, the British Government, all persecuted them, tortured them, locked them up in prisons, shed the Hindu blood at various places, to crush this great agitational movement of the Hindus**. But throughout the whole of India these avowed pro-Hindu (Hindutwa-nishtas) faced boldly all the atrocities of the enemies, even when they were in a minority. They even did not refrain from avenging the spilling of Hindu blood by shedding the enemy blood and by beheading those who proved treacherous to the Hindu cause ! 
1131. Fortunately this retaliation by the loyal Hindus, done at the risk of their lives, did not prove quite futile. For although the British Government decided much against our wishes to partition India, they had to concede to the least of our demands that instead of giving over the whole of the Punjab and Bengal to the Muslims, as per their demand, only the Muslim-majority part of those provinces should be included in Pakistan while the rest of the Punjab and Bengal with Hindu majority should be joined to India as Eastern Punjab and West Bengal. The demand of the loyal Hindus 
•eXH GLORIOUS EPOCH 473 
(Hindutwa-nishtas) 'Let us vivisect their proposed Pakistan before they vivisect our Hindustan'**, thus proved successful. And as for the more dangerous Muslim demand for a corridor —a passage through north India to join the Punjab and the 
•Bengal—not a word was ever spoken nor considered during these talks of the transfer of power mainly because of the bitterest opposition of these 'loyal' Hindus ! 
1132. And when during the elections for the central and provincial legislatures of India the majority of the Indian voters elected those very candidates and parties who gave their consent to create Pakistan, they proved themselves to i)e the greatest sinners, responsible for the horrible national 
•crime of eternally harming the undivided India ! 
1133. Again, the 'loyal Hindus' knew in their heart of hearts that this creation of Pakistan was the neces.=;ary conse­ quence of the great sins of cherishing perverted conception of virtues, of banning reconversion of the polluted Hindus and many other such religious and social vices imbibed in us from our old ancestors. These very anti-Hindu and anti- national practices of the Hindus had already created big and small 'Pakistans' in every city and every village. It was inevitable that we had to suffer the horrible consequences of "these our social sins and crimes. A detailed discussion on this point is available in the foregoing pages, (cf. Chapter 8 Paras 421 to 472) 
1134. While all these momentous movements were going 
••on in India the British Cabinet itself, after taking into -account the general trend, tabled a bill in the British Parlia­ ment, named 'Independence of India Act', which was unanimously passed. Accordingly on the 15th of August, 1947 the British Governor-General in Delhi declared, at last, -with the consent of the elected representatives of India, that the British nation was on that day liberating India from their imperial domination and making it politically free, that of the Mushm majority districts of West Punjab and East Bengal separate independent Muslim State, called 'Pakistan' would be created. While the rest of India would 
474 SIX GLORIOUS EPOCHS OF INDIAN HISTORY 
be founded as an independent Indian State **!!! 
1135. Thus was India liberated from the domination of the British Empire and this great Indian republic was established ! The practical politicians amongst the 'loyal Hindus' satisfied themselves with the thought that under the present circumstances whatever was obtained was not meagre ! Though not the whole of Bharat at least three- fourths of it was liberated in an undivided state ! Quite a great boon indeed ! After about a thousand years a great new age of national importance has dawned in the history of the Hindus. As such the real strategy for the Hindus from the point of view of their own benefit and the greater glory of Hindutwa is first to make the newly won Bharat wholly their own. The fragments that were left in the foreign hands could be attended to later on ! , 
1136. Immediately the British Union Jack which had been fluttering proudly over the Red Fort in Delhi—over the heart of India as it were—for the last hundred or a hundred, and fifty years with overbearing imperial haughtiness, was pulled down and in its place was hoisted amidst tumultuous applause and the deafening cries of 'Hail, Indian Indepen­ dence, all Hail to thee !' the tri-coloured flag of the indepen­ dent, sovereign Government of India, with the 'Sudarshan' wheel imprinted on it ! 
1137. From the Western Seas came the British imperial power marching on us with the supercilious vanity that with the sword alone they would conquer empires and with the sword alone would they run them; and straightaway it chmbed the Indian imperial throne of Delhi. But at last from the very same throne of Delhi was it dragged down, its vaunting sword being cut to pieces ! To the shores of the very same Western Seas it was driven back and was ultimately submerged into the very same Western Seas ! The last defeated British soldier, we saw with our own eyes going back to the same Western Seas with his head hung down and back towards us. 
1138. Thus of all the foreign aggressions over India, 
5TH GLORIOUS EPOCH 475 
that took place during the last two thousand years> the greatest and mightiest one—the sixth in order—that of the British was in the end utterly defeated by India and its political domination crushed to pieces I 
1139. Thus disappeared the mighty English empire 1 And when it did disappear, it did so, so very suddenly and speedily, so very completely, that the transfer of the empire —instead of appearing to be the transfer of power—appeared to be a change of dream. Till but yesterday not a straw moved in India without express orders from the English 1 But today ! Not an English Officer is to be found in India. 
1140. This victory over the English which deserves th& Commemoration by A Horse-Sacrifice is THE SIXTH OF THE GLORIOUS HINDU VICTORIES over foreign aggressors !

The world is divided into two camps, dar- ul-Islam (abode of Islam) and dar-ul-Harb (abode of War). All countries come under one category or the other.
