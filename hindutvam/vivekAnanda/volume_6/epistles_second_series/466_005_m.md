## V

AUNTPUR,\*  
*7th February, 1889*.

DEAR M—,

Thanks a hundred thousand times, Master! You have hit Ramakrishna in the
right point.

Few, alas, few understand him! 

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. My heart leaps with joy — and it is a wonder that I do not go mad
when I find anybody thoroughly launched into the midst of the doctrine
which is to shower peace on earth hereafter.

\*A village in the Hooghly District, the birth-place of Swami
Premananda. The letter was written to Master Mahashaya.
