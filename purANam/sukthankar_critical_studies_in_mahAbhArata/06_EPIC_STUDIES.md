## Some Aspects of the Mahabharata Canon.

The problem of the Mahabharata textual criticism is a problem sui generis.
Here the principles of textual reconstruction must first be evolved from an
intensive study of the manuscript material and the‘ manuscript tradition.’^
They can be finally considered as settled only after prolonged and consider-
able discussion and exchange of ideas and opinions.

The vulgate text of the Mbh. is fairly readable and appears, in places,
to be even “ better ” than the critical text, because the former has been purged
by the continuous emendations of scholars for cetituries. The reader is con-
sequently apt to prefer, at first sight, the readings of the vulgate text, but a
thorough and sympathetic study of the author’s language and thought and a
critical evaluation of the variants would show him that the constituted text
is sound.

Of the many reviews of the first fascicule of the critical edition of the
Mahabharata that have appeared during the past year there are two
that deserve my special attention : the review by Dr. Hermann Weller in
the Zeitschrift fur Indologie und Irmistik (vol. 6, pp. 166 ff.), and that by
Professor Edgerton in the Journal of the American Oriental Society (vol. 48,
pp. 186-190). Both reviews are evidently products of a very close study of
the text and the critical apparatus. Particularly valuable is the review by
Prof. Edgerton, who can appreciate the difficulties of the problem I have
had to confront perhaps better than most scholars, since he has had to struggle
with problems of a like nature in his valuable work on the Paficatantra and
the Vikramacarita.

In the succeeding pages I have endeavoured to set forth my reasons for
adopting in the text the readings that have commended {158} themselves to
mef, in those cases whidi have been discussed by Weller and Edgerton in
the reviews mentioned above. They concern the readings of 1, 1. 19, 42, 49,
62, 201, and of the identification of the hundred sub-parvans of the Mbh.
enumerated in the second adhyiaya of the Adiparvan, that is, in the Parvasam-
grahaparvan.2

2 As most of the references in these studies will be to the Mahabharata, all
numbers without alphabetical prefix refer to the critical edition of the epic. When
a reference is made to other edtions of the epic, I have prefixed’ to the reference an
Midicatory letter enclosed within parantheses : thus (C.) denotes the Cakutta edi-
tion, (B.) the Bombay edition, and (K.) the Kumbhakonam edition.

EPIC STUDIES


1. 1. 19 :

vedais caturbhilji samitam (v. 1 . smmniidm).

Weller suggests an emendation — ^in fact, two alternative emeindations.
He first proposes to read sammitdm for my samtdm. The former variant
is found only in one MS. which besides transposes the first two words of the‘
piada. His alternative suggestion is more radical. Seeing that the variant
preferred by him yields a pada metrically defective, he proposes to mend
matters by recasting the pada thus : caturUhih mmmitdm vedaili. This
pathya he thinks, must have been the original reading of the pMa. The
only reason Weller has adduced for rejecting the text reading is the sup-
posed intrinsic fitness of the alternate ; it suits the conteixt much better, he
believes. K^, the solitary MS. which contains the reading preferred by
Weller, stands sixth on my list of K MSS., whose relative valu« diminishes
in the order there given ; it is full of clerical mistakes, due probably to the
difficulty eixperienced by the copyist (either of this MS. or of one of its
ancestors) in deciphering the ( ? iSaradia) exemplar. I consider it an inferior
codex. With Weller’s reading we get a prior pada with the scansion

— / ^ — . Hopkins* statistical study of the relative frequency

of the different forms of the padas {Great Epic, p. 236) shows that this is
a “rare** combination. Even Weller realizes that the line does not read
smoothly and calls therefore the length of the sixth syllable a “metrical
archaism.*’ Now samitam (of the text, {159} without the anusvara) recurs
in a similar context, also at the end of a prior pada, and apparently in the
same sense in (B.) 1. 96.90 : idam hi vedaih samitam. It also occurs, in a
different context, in Susruta 2 . 346. 3 : angusphaparvasamitam. If we read
sammitdm in the passage under discussion, we should have pari passu to read
it in the two latter passages also, both of which then would be metrically
delfective ; the scansion of the first would be nearly the same as tliat of the
pSda in question, the second would end with three consecutive iambs. Are
these all instances of “ metrical archaisms *’ ? For that, it seems to me, the
documental probability of the reading perferred by Weller is not strong
enough. The text re(ading, which is mentioned by Nilakaptha as a variant,
is supported indirectly by {satnatam) and directly by Ko. 3 . 4.0 On

the other hand, Weller’s reading, as has already been remarked, is found
only in one inferior MS. Worthy of note is Nilakantha’s gloss : samitam Hi
pdphe Udydm ity arthah. The initial mistake of Weller lies in supposing that
sammitdm suits the context better than samitdm, wherelas, in point of fact,
sammmitdm is nothing more than a doublet of the other word. Weller does
not realize that his attempt to substitute an “ easier reading ” has been anti-
cipated by the scribe of K 5 , who likewise finding the emended line (metrically)
unreadable has transposed the words of the pada, reaching a new combina-
tion : caturbhir vedaih sammitdm, which according to Hopkins {loc. cit.) is
of “very rare, sporadic** occurrence. The word samita has been perfectly

correctly explained in PW. : samita {su -f mita) — sammita, “ gleiches Mass
habend, gleich.” The relation between the two words is clearly revealed by the
more familiar doublets satata : samtat\a, sahita : samhita and so on, 5/i-and sam
being the unaccented and accented forms of one and the same prefix. When
the accentual factor became inoperative, the choice was conditioned solely by
metrical considerations. The identification in the case of samita may have
been helped by contamination with sam + ita { — samgata)y “conformable
to, in harmony with ” (a meaning not unsuitable even here), or by its sup-
posed connection with sama, “ equal “ (cf. Wackernagel, Altind. Gramm.
II, 1 . § ‘30 \>p). The semantic values of the words in question being the
same, the combined {160} forcd of documental probability and metrical pre-
ference decides the question of choice incontestably in favour of the adopted
text.

The text reading really needs some further justification. Weller’s mis-
understanding of the* text is, ini my opinion, a direct confirmation of my re-
mark in thei Foreword (p. vi) that it is a lectio difficilior. The word was,
I suppose, early misunderstood. To judge by the character of the variants,
it was comnxonly, though erroneously, interpreted as sam -f ita, “ united, com-
bined with.” In this sense, in course of time, it must have been ousted by
its easier synonyms samyukta (substituted for it in B D) and sahita
(mainly in T and G). Both these readings are inadequate. Nilakaijitl'ia s
explanation caturveddrthavatlm is inadmissible ; the phrase can at best mean
catutvedaviattm\ (“possessing the four Vedas”), which is of course sheer
nonsense. Roy’s “ comprehendeth the sense of the four Vedas ” and Dutt’s
“contains the sense of the four Vedas” are dually inaccurate paraphrases
(based upon the explanation furnished by the scholiast), because the passage
in the vulgate cannot be'ar the meaning here forced! upon it. On the other
hand, the literal meaning of semtyukta or sahita is, as already re-
marked, wholly imsuitable. For what could the assembled sages melan by
saying that they wished to hear the (Mahabharata) Samhita “combined with
the four Vedas ” ?

To return to the manuscript evidence. The K group is partly corrupt
and indecisive though the majority has the text reading : Ko. y. 4. o as in text;
Kj sahitdm ; K., samUtam ; K5 smhmitdm. All these stand resolutely against
samyuktdm of the vulgate ; but, from the point of view of transcriptional
probability, none of them is wholly incompatible with samitdm of the text.
Three out of the four Malayalam MSS-, have also prewired the true reading ;
the remaining Malayalam MS. has sahitdm, the reading of the T G group.
With this data I should explain the genesis of the’ variants thus. The text
reading is a lectio difficilior, preserved in the majority of K intact, and in
the remaining MSS. of the K version in a corrupt condition. The K read-
ing being partly supported by M, there is a partial agreement between two
more or less independent versions, a condition almost wholly absent in the

After having proved that the text reading is not only better documented

can be suggested how the variant eva ca may have arisen. Two explana-
tions — both mere possibilities — occur to me. It is for one thing possible that
the original dtmavdn may have been deliberately suppressed in order to avoid
the monotonous reiteration of dtma at the end of three consecutive verses.
A more likely reason for the suppression may have been the lack of a copula
in the original line, which had been crowded out by the succession of three un-
usually long names (two of four syllables each, and the third one of not less
than five), taking up by themselves 13 syllables out of an aggregate of 16 of
the 41oka line.

one hand and by one section of the Southern recension on the other. But
the compelling power of this agreement is weakened by the circumstance that
one Malayalam MS. and three (out of the seven) Grantha MSS. are outside
the group. Had the whole of B agreed with the whole of S, it would have
been difficult, if not impossible, for reasons explained in the previous section,
£165} to reject the concordant reading. The weak point of this variant lies
in the fact that it does not at all explain, as far as I can judge, how the other
readings may have arisen. There is the same flaw in the other rejected
variant, though not in the same degree. The text reading, though weakly
supported by MSS, serves admirably, in my opinion, to account for the
existence of the variahts, especially if smhksepam is taken as an adverbial
gerund in-am (Pacini’s nanud), as I think it should be ; c/. Whitney, Sans-
krit Grammar, § 995. For there would then be an inherent tendency to substi-
tute for it simpler readings, samksipya ca and samksepatah would be very
neat paraphrases of the awkward adverbial gerund : the second {samksepatah)
preserving nearly intact the original ak^aras, the first {samk^ipya) involving
a more radical change from the view-point of form, but closely following the
original in sense. The latter may, moreover, have been directly suggested by
vistlrya in the first pada which it nicely balances. I assume, of course, that
samksipy\a was introduced independently in B D on the one hand and S on
the other. In other words, I think that the concordance between certain
sections of the Northern and the Southern recensions is purely accidental, and
it is unquestionable that it could be that. I must frankly admit, however,
that there is a strong element of subjectivity in this choice, which can in no
way be said to be compelling. I prefer the text reading, fully realizing that
others may prefer either of the other two readings ; but that is precisely why
a wavy line has been printed in the text below samksepam, I doubt very
much whether any compelling reason can be advanced to prove the absolute
superiority of any one of the variants over the others.

Edgerton discusses at some length the variation amrtam : am tarn and
decides emphatically in favour of anrtam, Edgerton’s arguments are briefly
these : first and foremost, the text reading does not do justice to the emphatic
particle eva in the same line, which is a “ crucial word ^ secondly, anrlam is
intrinsically far superior to the innocuous amrtam, which has been substituted
for the original lectio difficUm by ignorant copyists who, missing the “ para-
dox ” intended, naturally gagged at attributing ‘ falsehood ' to the epic.”
In the first place I differ from Edgerton radically as to the value and im-
portance of the word eva in the sentence. It is unquestionably true that eva
does emphasize the preceding word or words, but this is neither necessarily
nor universally true. Very frequently, especially in the epics and the
Puranas, the emphasis is so slight that it is almost negligible, and the word
is nothing more than an expletive. My experience fully corroborates P. W.,
which has the following note s. v. eva : ” Nicht selten, aamenlich nach einigen
Partikeln, ist die Bedeutung von eva abgeschwacht, dass wir auch den Nach-
druck aufgeben.” But the best answer to Edgerton’s contention as to the
value of eva is to show that it figures very frequently at the end of the pada,
in long enumerations of names and attributes where no emphasis could be
intended whatsoever. Here are some examples- chosen at random :

Edgerton discusses at some length the variation arnrtam : anrtam and
decides emphatically in favour of mrtam, Edgerton’s arguments are briefly
these : first and foremost, the text reading does not do justice to the emphatic

In the first place I differ from Edgerton radically as to the value and im-
portance of the word eva in the sentence. It is unquestionably true that eva
does emphasize the preceding word or words, but this is neither necessarily
nor universally true. Very frequently, especially in the epics and the

value of eva is to show that it figures very frequently at the end of the pada,

intended whatsoever. Here are some examples chosen at random :

It would be clearly preposterous to see in these evu ca emphatic parti-
cles” or “crucial words” emphasizing paradoxes; £170} they are nothing
more than copulative expletives. My impression is that the epic “ poets ”
use the conjunctions m, caiva or eva ca according as they require one, two or
three syllables to fill their line ! This, I hope, will suffice to dispose of the
alleged necessity of looking for and finding any striking paradox in
this line.

But I think Edgerton is making another and a graver mistake. His
remark that “ the panegyrist of the epic [italics mine] starts out to claim that
it contains everything makes me suspect that Edgerton has possibly mis-
understood the hemistich in question. Here the subject matter of glorifica-
tion is not the epic at all. but merely the first’ adhyaya thereof. The hemis-
tich occurs in a passage at the end of the first adhyiaya, and the passage is
evidently of the nature of a phalasrutL The hemistich says : “ This is the
body of the (Maha-) Bharat a.” Here “ this refers not to the whole epic but
merely to the Anukramainl chapter mentioned in the previous stanzas. The
whole line is a subordinate {hi) clause depending upon the main clause con-
tained in the immediately preceding stanza. “ (200) He who repeats (in an
undertone, even) a little of the Anukramani at both twilights is freed immedi-
ately from as much sin as has been accumulated during the day and the night ;
(201) for, this is the body of the (Maha-)Bharata (that is) Truth and also
Immortality ! ” It is owing to its partaking of the qualities of (or, as the pane-
gyrist of the adhyaya will have it, owing to its being) Truth and Immortality
that it is able to absolve the devout reciter of the adhyaya immediately from
sin. The emphasis, if any, is on hi (“for”), not on eva. Objection may be
taken to the neuter gender of etat, since it is made to refer the Anukramani
(f.) chapter as I do here. The gender may be explained either as a case of
attraction by the gender of the predicate {vapus, n.) or as referring indiscri-
minately to anukramofii (f.) or adhyaya (m.). But if Edgerton does not
like that, I have no great objection to his translating : “ For this form of the
(Maha-)Bharata is Truth and Immortality.” According to this interpreta-
tion, the variant amtam is wholly inappropriate and inadmissible ; and in fact
on second thoughts I am inclined even to dispense with the wavy line under
amrtam.

£171} The paradox conceived by Edgerton might apply fitly to the
whole? epic, which may be said to mirror all phases of life, ‘‘ Truth, — yes,
and Falsehood too ! ” but it is clearly unreasonable and even impossible to
say that the Anukramaji^ chapter by itself could be “ Truth,— yes and False-
hood too.” Furthermore, even if this wonderful chapter be the Truth as well
as Falsehood, I fail to see how it should follow that such a chapter could on
that account be able to give absolution to a sinner. If one bears in mind
that the subject matter of the panegyric is the Anukramani chapter (and not



198


EPIC STUDIES


the epic), one cannot, I think, come to any other conclusion than that the tru(:
reading is rnnrtam.

It may be added that Edgerton’s mistake is quite natural and is caused
primarily by the* misleading division of the passage (stanzas 200-202) into
distiches, which suggests that the subject matter of the pr^asti is the Maha-
bharata. The first half of stanza 201 is logically and grammatically con-
nected with the preceding stanza (200); on the other hand the second half
is part and parcel of the following stanza (202). The first half clearly refers
to the Anukramani chapter, the second half equally clearly to the epic as a
whole. Could I have foreseen the confusion it is apt to cause, I would cer-
tainly have joined the first half of stanza 201 to 200 and the second half to
stanza 202, notwithstanding that this arrangelment yields two consecutive three-
line stanzas. In such cases I have mostly made three distiches, sometimes,
I fear, as in this instance, clouding the sense.

There remains now only one point to be* considered. By saying that
amrtam is a lectio difficilior, Edgerton implies that the change from amHam
into anrtdm is ordinarily inconceivable, since any copyist would have fought
shy of attributing falsehood to the epic. Such a view would, in my opinion,
be entirely incorrect. The distinguishing feature of scribes’ emendations is
that it is superficial. The scribe does not stop to think very deeply about
the consequences of the change. Here, I fancy, the variant has arisen merely
because, in entirely different contexts, satyam and anftam are found frequently
combined into a phrase, sometimes even combined into the compound
satyanrta (e.g. satydnrt\e yo vivmakie loke, 1. 3. 152 ; satydnrte avapasyan
jandndm RV. 7.49.3). I {172} therefore hold that the substitutions of anrtam
for amftam is wholly within the range of probability and even quite natural
for an Indian scribe.

Although it is prefectly true that all previous efforts to make the text
of the Mbh. agree with the numerical data of its extent and size have ended
in dismal failures, Edgerton is needlessly nervous about my attempt to re-
duce the number of the (sub-)parvans exactly to one hundred. Edgerton’s
view is that the traditional hundred ^ould be regarded as an approximate
or “ round ” number. This is the explanation given also by C. V. Vaidya
in his Epic India (p. 189) when he is faced with the anomaly that his list
of " hundred parvans ” contains 107 titles. In support of the view, one mi^t
cite the use of the word sataka in titles of anthologies like the SrngSrasataka,
which frequently, if not uniformly, contain more than 100 stanzas. The paral-
lelism would, in my opinion, be not quite exact, because, I think, here the suffix
ka (miscalled svdrthe by Indian grammarians) probably suggests, if it does not

actually connote, the approximate character of the denominaticxi. Less con-
vincing still isi the analogy (mentioned by C. V. Vaidya, loc. cit.) of the ap-
pellation satasdhasn of the Mbh, This expression is admittedly not intended
to mean exactly one hundred thousand, whatever else it may mean. But the
latitude implicitly allowed in the use of the expression satasahasra in stating
the number of stanzas which are approximately a lakh cannot, it seems to me,
be claimed by a person giving the number of chapters which are approKf-
mately only one hundred. That question apart, when the old experts of the
Great Epic {bhdratacintaka, 1. 2. 172) had calculated and stated the
exact number of adhyayas and slokas, parvan by parvan for all the eighteen
parvans, apparently correct to the last digit, would it not be exceedingly
strange if the numbet of the chapter-groups alone, given in the very same
adhyaya, in the same context, were to be only approximate ? A few stanzas
more or less in an aggregate of several thousand stanzas, or a few adhyayas
more or less {175} in an aggregate of several hundred adhyayas would not have
mattered very much one way or the* other ; but a few parvans more or less
when the total was only in the neighbourhood of hundred ! So careless I
suppose even the careless custodians of the fifth Veda were not. Their cal-
culations imy have befen wrong, but their intention is perfectly clear. They
say and mean that the number was exactly one hundred : notice the puniam
in the first pada of the hemistich. In fact, the amazing difference in the
lengths and characters of these chapter-groups — ^there are some containing
only 1 adhyaya and less than 70 stanzas, there are others which contain more
than 70 adhyayas and considerably more than 3,000 stanzas ! — could, I think,
only have been the result of an over-mastering desire on the' part of some
old editor or editors to reach, by hook on crook, some such predetermined
“round"’ number.

Edgerton is perfectly right when he says that tlie attempt to reconstruct
the original text of this passage presents some very serious textual difficulties.
Whether my text will finally prove correct in every respect or not remains of ,
course! to be seen. I hope it will fit the constituted text of the whole epic ;
but I shall not be greatly shocked if it does not. The texts of the present
editions, Calcutta, Bombay or Kumbhakonam, do not conform to the detahs
given in the “ Table of Contents.” There arc all kinds of discrepiancies bet-
ween them : the sloka numbers do not agree’ ; the same is true of the adhyaya
and the parvan number. These discrepancies cannot be helped, — so long as
we do not know who had done the coimting andj when it was done. As for
the constituted text of the passage in question, I will only say that I have
forniied it rigidly on the! principles of textual criticism worked out by me and
followed elsewhere in the course of my work on the edition. These principles
have been applied independently of the queJStion of the past, present cm* future
form and divisions of the epic. The constituted text is based
mainly on documental and intrinsic probability. It is



200


EPIC STUDIES


more than likely that it contains some slight errors ; the different versions are
interwove'n in such an intricate manner that to disentangle them with com*
plete assurance or to one's complete satisfaction is not yet possible, or perhaps
is no longer possible. I honestly believe that the discrepancieis between the
constituted {174} text and the present Table of Contents," will be very
considerably diminished. But about one thing I feel perfectly confident and
that is that the number is intended to be exactly one hundred. Edgerton
himself would probably have been less sceptical had he known that both
Arjunamisra and NUakaaita have left behind them in their scholia mnemonic
stanzas, stating the exact number of (sub-)parvans in each of the eighteen
(major) parvans. In both cases the total is exactly one hundred ; besides
that, the individual figures tally exactly in the two lists.

Here are the stanzas themselves.

My series differs from that of the mnemonic stanzas only as regards
the two (consecutive) parvans Santi and Anu^sanr,. The aggregate number
of the two parvans is the same in our lists ; the discrepancy is only with
regard to the division of the five sub-parvans between the two major parvans.
My figures for these parvans are 3 and 2 ; those given, by the scholiasts in
their stanzas are 4 and 1 respectively, differing only by one each from mine.
I am unable to account for this discrepancy at present.

These stanza;s, it will have to be admitted, make the case for the ex-
actitude of the figure 100 very much stronger. Is it conceivable that two
different scholiasts would make up two different mnemonic stanzas, each
giving a perfectly fictitious series of figures, with the total exactly hundred,

1 It will be noticed that 17 (out of the aggregate of 19) names of the (major)
parvans, in this scheme, are identical with the names of the Mial (sub-)parvan
of each group. This is valuable because it suggests how the names of the 19
(major) parvans were obtained from the (older) list of the hundred (sub-) parvans.




EPIC STUDIES II

for the number of chapter-groups in each of the eighteen books of the epic ?
These stanza's establish, in my opinion, irrefutably that as late as the time
of Arjunamisra the total number of (sub-)parvans was believed to be exactly
one hundred, and (what is much more important) the exact number of
(sub-)parvan in each of the (major) parvans wasi also believed to be
accurately known. Whether or not these figures tallied exactly with the
actual divisions of the version of the text prepared by these commentators
is an entirely different question, which I am not yet prepared to answer in
the affirmative. These stanzas stand, in my opinion, for an effort to save
from the limbo of oblivion some precious fragment of traditional knowledge
regarding the epic. Like fossils these skeletons of the old Parvasarhgraha-
parva have survived, despite the frantic efforts of centuries of editors and
critics to make the “ Table of Contents '' agree with the form of the text
known to them.

Many of Edgerton’s suggestions and queries relate to the uses of the
wavy line : mostly cases where he has either less or {178} more confidence
in the readings I haVe adopted. This device, as Edgerton himself admits,
is *‘by its very nature hard to apply strictly and consistently.” Moreover,
most of tile words cited by him are merely commonplace adverbs, conjunc-
tions and other expletives like caiva, dkuh (v. 1. viduh), iha, vd, tv-air a, edpi,
kintrvd (v. 1. vd kirn) and so on. I will therefore forbear from entering
into a detailed discussion of the relative merits of the variants, especially
as, in the maljority of the cases, the manuscript evidence is so conflicting
that absolute certainty is impossible.

I cannot conclude this paper without expressing both to Professor
Edgerton ahd to Dr. Weller my cordial thanks for the very kind remarks
they have to make regarding the work in general, and my keen stppreciation
of the uniformly courteous tone of their very sympathetic reviews.

## Further Text-critical Notes

The organizers of the new Indian project of preparing a critical edition
of the Mahlabharata are deeply indebted to both Geheimrat Luders and
Professor Winternitz not merely for their taking personally a keen interest
in the scheme, but for their bringing the project formally to the notice of
the savants assembled at the historic XVIIth International Congress of
Orientalists held at Oxford in August 1928, and moving resolutions convey-
ing messages of appreciation and congratulation. ^ A singularly happy
feature of this event was that this gesture of cordial sympathy and willing
co-operation should have proceeded spontaneously from just those two

♦ [ABORL 11. 165-191].

animously by the Indian Section of the Congress has been published by Winternitz
in Indolagka Pragemia, 1, 63^.

veteran scholars who not merely enjoy the greatest amount of respect and
confidence in the world of Indologists but whose names are most intimately
connected with the earlier scheme of the International Association of Acade-
mies of publishing a critical edition of our Great Epic. It is a matter of
high gratification to the members of the Mahabharata Editorial Board that
their modest efforts in the cause of Mahabharata studies are being so keenly
appreciated by their fellow workers in Europe, just as it is a matter of relief
to the responsible editors that the general method and principles underlying
the preparation of this edition have won the warm approval of the two
eminent European critics^ who have themselves made the closest study of
the central textual problem and enriched the literature on the subject by
the contribution of several valuable papers and monographs.

At the said session of the Congress of Orientalists, Winternitz read
a paper entitled “The Critical Edition of the Mahabharata”, dealing with
the history of the project from its early beginning^. Much of what Winternitz
says in this {166} memorable address of his bears the unmistakable stamp
of being personal reminiscences, because he was the first scholar who more
than thirty years ago, at the Xlth International Congress of Orientalists held
in Paris (1897), emphasized the superlative importance of a critical edition
of the Mahabharata and proposed measures for its preparation.®

After nearly thirty years of restless endeavour, he is again one of the
small group of the first collaborators of the great and ambitious project.
EHiring 1922-3 he used his opportunities as a Guest Professor at the Univer-
sity of the poet philosopher Rabindranath Tagore to train some of his ad-
vanced pupils at the Visvabharatl to do collation work, thus helping to
establish there a centre for the collation of Bangali MSS. of the Mahabha-
rata, ^ a centre which is still doing excellent work under the supervision of
the Principal, Pandit Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya. Finally, Winternitz
has taken over some of the editorial burden on hi> own shoulders by kindly
agreeing to edit for the Institute one Parvan, the Sabhaparvan. This is in-
deed a very happy augury for the continued success of our cherished project.

To the text of his Congress address, which be has published in the
first issue of his Journal, Indologica Pr ageusia, Vol. 1 (1929), pp. 58-63,
Winternitz has appended (pp. 64-68) some critical remarks on my edition
of the Adiparvan. While expressing his whole-hearted agreement with the
general principles underlying my reconstruction of the text, he has given a
long list of passages in which he differs from me with respect to the readings
of the constituted text. With unerring judgement he has picked out those

passages in the first two adhyayas that had given me most trouble, and he
has criticized the readings of the constituted text, weighing the pros and cons
with great acumen, and pointing out the errors and imperfections with much
delicacy and courtesy. While tendering him my cordial thanks for the
honour he has done me by making so close and penetrating a study of my
critical work, I shall endeavour here briefly to answer his queries and critic-
ism. I write these notes not so much to justify my selection and establish
the readings of the critical edition as £167} to set forth the reasons that
have guided me in the choice of the readings in question and that may not
have occurred to my critic — remarksj which will not fail to throw some fitful
light on the obscure and complicated processes which go to make up Maha-
bharata textual criticism.

Minor Questions.

1. 1. 30 : WiNTERNiTZ observes that “in the notes the interesting re-
      mark of Arjunamisra is given ; paramesthy atha iti prdyasali pdtipdh, but the
      actual reading of the Da MSS. is not given The reading of the Da MSS.
      not being specifically mentioned, it must, in conformity with a tacitly assum-
      ed Paribha^, be taken to be the same as the text reading, namely, para-
      me^thy iatha. In that sense the reading of the Da MSS. (i.e. of Arjuna-
      misra) has been given, and my note is both complete and correct, because
      both the Da MSS. collated for the passage do, in point of fact, read para^
      me^thy atha.^ Nevertheless, as I discovered on referring to the commentcuy
      once more, the note does not represent the facts fully and correctly, because
      the MSS. which are corrupt, being contaminated from the vulgate, had suc-
      ceeded, for the time being, in completely misleading me.

That the true Arjunamisra reading must, against the testimony of MSS.,
be assumed to be paramemarah (agreeing then with Dq.s Q) follows,
with certainty, from the commentary itself, a fact I had overlooked when
I wrote the note. The commentary runs thus :

«Tg: I i;: I 1 51R5I'.

tr:; I i

In the Foreword to Fascicule 1 (p. 1), I have already drawn attention
to the fact that “ the (epic) text in the Arjunamisra codices is frequently
contaminated from the “ vulgate '' and has to be corrected with the help of
Arjunamisra’s commentary.” The examples cited there are 1. 1. I7b and

^ A reference to Prof. Luders' Druckprab<t\ (p. 6) will show that the (Deva-
niagari) MSS. of Arjunami^ra's commentary collated by him for his Specimen edition
read likewise paramesthy atha; only in one instance has the reading been cor-
rected (by a later hand) to paramesvarah. Accordingly Prof. Luders has also
taken paramesthy atha as the reading of the version of Arjunamisra.

22^. In the former case, the Da MSS. read putiyam (like the vulgate, with
which the constituted text here agrees ; the true Arjunamisra [168} read-
ing is, however, punya-, as follows clearly from Arjunamisral’s own observa-
tion :

In the latter case (1. 1. 22 b), likewise, tlie Da MSS. read sivam, agree-
ing with many K and D MSS. ; but the commentary shows (as I have
pointed out in the notes) that the true Arjunamisra reading is sucim, agree-
ing with the constituted text, Hvam being only a variant mentioned by the
scholiast ;

m I i m yjyi i to

1 must here add, tlierefore, a word of caution. In the critical notes
published with the text, the readings as actually found in the (epic) text (in
contradistinction to the commentary) of the Arjunamisra codices have, as
a rule, been taken to represent the readings of Arjunamisra ; the commen-
tary was consulted by me only occasionally, in case of doubt or difficulty,
or when a pdphantara was noticed. It is, therefore, more than likely that,
owing to the fact our I>a MSS. are conflated by contamination with various
types of MSS., in particular with the Nilakahtha type, a few errors of the
kind pointed out by Winternitz may have inadvertently crept in. Such
errors can be rectified only by working through the whole commentary, word
for word, and comparing the lemmata with the (epic) text of the MSS. ;
even then one can of course be sure only of the words and passages actually
cited and explained by the scholiast.

The version of Arjunamisra, as I pointed out in the Foreword to Fasci-
cule 1 (p. v), is closely allied to the Bangali version. The reason for this
affinity (as I have stated elsewhere) appears to be that Arjunamisra was a
native of Bengal.^ Following the example of my predecessors, I have uti-
lized, for the critical edition of the Adiparvan, Devanagari MSS. of Arjuna-
misra’s commentary. The two MSS. I am using are extremely corrupt. In
fact, all the MSS. of Arjunamisra’s commentary I have seen— and they are
all Devanagari MSS.— have been remarkably corrupt. Not only that, the
text they offer is, as already remarked, obviously contaminated from the
[169} vulgate. This corruption of the Devatiagari MSS. I could not ac-
count for at first ; but it must be due, I cannot but think now, to their being
copies of Bangali or Maithili originals. It would, therefore, be expedient
to procure and use, whenever possible, Bangali- or Maithili MSS. of Arjuna-

over, the various readings have been given only at 1 . 2. 56, and, through some
unfortunate oversight, omitted at 1. 1. 131 and 1 . 2. 160. I make good the
omission here. At 1. 1. 131 the various readings are as follows. Ko. 2 - 4 .C

From the readings of the three passages in question, it should seem that,
anomalies apart, Kj (or the India Office Codex), Bangali and Southern MSS.
read it correctly (that is, with the palatal 5 ), while the rest of K agrees with
the commentators in reading it with the dental s. The balance of probability
inclines to the side of the palatal, I think, even if we restrict ourselves to the
MS. evidence. C. V. Vaidya {The Mahdbharata : A Criticism, p. 159)
speaks of them as the “ 7 clahs who came probably from the Afagan {sic)
borders,” but it seems to me more likely that they got their nickname from
the fact that they had bound themselves by an oath to kill Arjuna or die in

the great Bharata* battle (Dropap, 17).

1. 2. 85 : The spurious line (102*) kutasya Dhmdird^prena pre^mani
      Pmpdavdn prati stands in the MSS. not before 97* (as WINTERNITZ imagines
      and very naturally), but after 101*, as correctly stated in the critical notes.
      I haVe re-examined the MSS. concerned on the point and find that my note is
      perfectly correct. One cannot be dogmatic about the Mahabharata MSS.;
      there is no knowing what they may or may not contain. The line was found
      only in six Nilakantha MSS. in Devahagarl or Bangali characters, collated
      for the first two adhyayas. In all these six MSS. the line is found inter-
      polated at the same place, the place mentioned in the critical apparatus
      (namely, after 101*), although all printed editions without exception place
      it elsewhere (namely, before 97*), which is no doubt the reason of Winter-
      NiTZ’s remark. A note drawing attention to this patent discrepancy might
      have been usefully added in the critical notes. But I have found the printed
      editions so arbitrary and unreliable^ that I have almost £171} completely
      ignored them in the foot-notes, which have necessarily to be rather brief and
      to the point. The meaning of this enigmatic line found in Nilakaptha MSS.
      is as obscure toi me a’s the cause of its transposition in the first printed edi-
      tion. We need not inquire why the line occurs in the wrong place in the
      other editions as well, since the subsequent editors appear to have studiously
      and uniformly avoided consulting MSS. Winternitz could easily convince
      himself of the correctness of my statement regarding the point of insertion
      of this line in the MSS. by referring to the superb complete copy of the MahS-
      bharata in iSarada characters, with Nilakantha s scholium, he purchased in
      Kasmar during his stay there.

      of the K MSS., the only group which, as Winternitz rightly remarks, gives
      the undoubtedly correct rendering of the whole stanza ; all other MSS.-— even

such as do not contain the interpolated line 112* — are in utter confusion.

This is indeed a difficult case, and I for my part doubt whether any
definite decision can be reached as to how the stanza originally read. I must
say, I cannot share the confidence with which Winternitz decides for the
reading :

yadd Vdyuh Sakiasuryau ca yuktau,

which is mentioned as a patha by Nilakantha and was adopted in the editio
prmceps. It is one of the eight rival readings and is found chiefly in the
Bangali version, and in MSS, and editions allied to or influenced by it. The
combinations found £172} in the different MSS. may be arranged schemati-
cally as follows :

According to Winternitz, the stanza refers to (B.) 7. 7. 34 ff. ‘‘where
the line vdtoddhutcmi rajas tivram etc., also testifies to the reading vdyuh,
while iakra {— Indra) probably refers to the rain of pieces of flesh, bones
and blood.” To start with I doubt whether Sakra could be held responsible
for the “ rain ” of flesh, bones, and sundry other articles ; but that is a minor
point, immaterial to the present discussion. In believing, however, that our
stanza refers to (B.) 7. 7. 34 ff., Winternitz is partly mistaken, as will
presently appear. The important point is that in the opinion of Winternitz
the stanza alludes to certain forces of Nature, certain elements, such as wind,
rain and so on, which were favourable to the P^davas and unfavourable to
the Kauravas. The commentators Nilakaptba, Arjunami^ra and Devabodha
(with the readings which they had adopted or which were before
them) have explained the stanza in a similar way. I hold a different view,
however. When I selected the reading of the constituted text, I thought—
and I still think— that in this stanza there is allusion not to the elements, but
to some mtrologicd factor or constellation — an allusion which was not under-
stood by commentators and which I could not then fully explain. On read-
ing the criticism of Prof. Winternitz, I therefore made a reference to my



210


EPIC STUDIES


friend Prof. Jyotish Chandra Ghatak, M. A., of Calcutta University, who
has made a special study of Indian Astrology and allied sciences and is rightly
regarded as an authority on these topics ; and I was not disappointed. Hav-
ing already worked through the whole of the Mahabharata in special search
of references which have a bearing on Astrology, Augury and kindred subjects,
he could at once lay his fingers on the right passage, the prototype of our
stanza, which throws a flood of light on the question, without however fully
solving the riddle of the stanza, so far as I cah judge. The said stanza,
(B.) 6. 20. 2, reads :

{173} [Dhrtara§tra to Sariijaya]

%5rt

sqWRT I

While the connection between the two stanzas is patent and indeed un-
questionable, the discovery of the prototype leaves, unfortunately, nK)st of
our real difficulties unsolved. The reading which agrees closest with that of
the Bhi§maparvan stahza is that of the vulgate text and is found only in the
MSS. of NilakaiTitba. These latter have Vayu-Chandra-Surya (lacking Sakra
or Sukra altogether) like Soma-Surya-Vayu of the Bhi§maparvan. Is the
Nilakaiptha reading then the original reading ? As I have pointed out else-
where, we are apt to prefer, at first sight, the readings of the vulgate, which
appear to be better than those of the critical text ; but that is only because
the text of the vulgate has been arrived at by the purging of the original by
the continuous emendations of scholars for centuries.^ It seems to me that there
is a long history behind the reading of the vulgate in the present case also.
Nilakaptha had evidently arrived at it by an emendation, by collation with
the prototype, because there is no indication of the re being any MSS. before
him which could have contained that particular combination. This fact may,
perhaps, supply us with a clue to the labyrinth of the readings recorded in
the critical notes for the line in question. An important factor is that Sukra
(or sakra), which persistently occurs in all the various categories of our
MSS. and which must, therefore, be regarded as an essential feature of our
stanza, is entirely lacking in the later stanza. This proves irrefutably that
the combination of the former was not identical, in every respect, with that
of the latter originally. That is an important point to remember. WlNTER-
NIT2 is emphatic in a'sserting that yadd Vdyuh of the original was changed
in S into the usual yada§rau$am. This assumption does not seem to me to

211


be at all well founded, because the very next stanza (130) begins yadd
Dr OHO vivid hm astramdtgm, and here no attempt has been made in S (or
anywhere else) to change the beginning into yadasrcdui^m. There are a few
more stanzas (133, 140, 145) in {174} this series which do not begin with
the oft-repeated formula. It seems to me much more likely, therefore, that
Vayu was introduced into our passage, secondarily, by some early Northern
redactor who knew the prototype and had noticed the omission of one of the
elements in the prior stanza ; precisely as Nilakantha, much later, appears
to have further altered the line by changing the difficult Sakra (or iSukra)
to Candra, thus equating the combination to that of the prototype. I there-
fore adhere to my original choice, explaining the genesis of the variants as
follows. The stanza in question, which was suggested to the author of the
yadakau^am section by the Bhi^maparvan stanza but was composed from
a vague recollection of the original, began like the other stanzas of the series,
and contained, moreover, an allusion to an astrological situation. Some Nor-
thern redactor (who had known the Bhi§maparvan stanza and noticed that
tlie first stanza did not contain Vayu) then deleted {a)srausam and substi-
tuted for it the missing Vayu, retaining, however, the original feature Sukra.
The corruption of Sukra into Sakra must be judged as easy and even natural
(in juxtaposition with Surya), in view of the famous episode of the Maha-
bharata which narrates how Indra‘, disguised as a mendicant Brahman, begs
for the miraculous ear-rings and the armour which had been Karpa s from
his birth and which had made him invincible. The emendatory activity of
the early Northern redactor was continued by Nilakantha, who expunged
the sakra (or Sukra) which he found in his MSS. (and perhaps did not
fully understand) and substituted for it Candra, thus equating the two com-
binations.

I am confirmed in the supposition that the original line contained only
two agencies instead of three by the fact that no MSS. hitherto collated
show yuktdh (plu. ) for yuktau (dual) in the first line, as they certainly
would have done, had there been three names in the original instead of two,
as I have given. ^

The question then arises whether Sukra and iSurya, as gMhas, were at
that time favourable to the P^ndavas or, what comes to the same thing,
adverse to the Kauravas. About {175} Surya I cahnot say. But as far as
Sukra is concerned, we may safely answer the question in the affirmative.
My friend Prof. Ghatak has kindly drawn my attention to a stanza in Vara-
hamihira’s Brhatsamhitd which, if dyutajivin may be taken to apply to the

1 It should be noted that even in the explanation of Winternitz, Sakra and
Surya do not make any combined effort. If the three elements wind, rain and
sun operate all together for the success of the Papdavas, then yuktdh is indeed the
correct word. What is the point of the dual, when the plural form would be even
metrically equally suitable?

Kauravas, would indicate that at the time of the Bharatal battle the planet
Sukra, which was then in the Purvabh5drapada (cf. 6 . 3 . 15), was in a
position which augured disaster to the Kauravas and was therefore favour-
able (anuloma) to the Paijdavas. The Brhatsamhitd reference ( 9 . 34) sup-
plied to me by my friend runs.

As Viayu is missing in the whole of S except Mj (which latter is a
conflated MS.), it can never be established that Viayu is an esseniwl element
of the original stanza ; on the other hand, (a)srausam, though of course no
less doubtful because it is documented also by only half of the entire evidence,
is rendered probable, if not required, by the context. But I am prepared
to leave the line as “ less than certain,” as indicated by the wavy line below
the words in question.

* ♦

1 . 1 . 180 : tava putrmr imkattamdli,

WiNTERNiTZ complains that the sentence is “ very awkward grammati-
cally”. To have called forth no less than nine attempts at emendation,
the original must indeed have been most awkward. Winternitz prefers
to read tava putrmr mahattardl}, pointing out that there is not much evidence
for the text reading. It is quite true that the text is weakly supported ;
but so are almost all the readings except that of the vulgate, which certainly

cannot be considered the original reading, as it is palpably an emendation.

The text is based on Ki. 5 G 5 . ^ only. But Winternitz’s reading is not
much better supported ; in its entirety it is found only in K 3 M ; because,
of the MSS. which do contain the questionable mahattkirdh^ Ko begins the
pada with tvatputrair ye and with tvatsutebhyo. I submit, therefore,
that the reading preferred by Winternitz is not better documented than
mine. That is the first point. Winternitz then seeks to explain the

variation on the ground that the scribes must have found difficulties with

the £ 176 } instr. putrmli. Now the so-called instr, comparationis is very
common in both epics and, I submit, that alone would not account for this
plethora of readings in the case of a simple line with a perfectly obvious
meaning. I know instances in the Mahabharata text where this instr. com-
porationis has called forth no variants at all in the MSS., no doubt because
it was felt to be quite normal by the copyists, editors and readers alike.
The cause of disturbance in this case must, therefore, be looked for else-
where, and that was principally, I think, the use of the superlative joined
to the instrumental.

In settling th^ original reading, the question is primarily one of fact, of
the actual MS. evidence, not of grammar. The Shakespearean “This was



EPIC STUDIES II


213


the most unkindest cut of all” cannot be judged and tended by modem
standards of grammar. It sounds harsh to our ears ; but there is, I suppose,
sufficient documentary evidence to prove or make it probable that the line
as I have quoted it was in point of fact written by the author of Julim Csesar
(who knew his English quite as well as, if indeed not better than, we do),
consciously or unconsciously using what our purists stigmatize as
vulgarism. The argument that a dramatist like Shakespeare could not com-
mit such a blunder (if blunder it be) would be without cogency, when the
MS. evidence supports the questionable reading.

The Mahabharata, I may point out here, has suffered from the great
misfortune of being always edited by learned Pahdits, who were concerned
more about the purity of diction than with the determination and preserva-
tion of the words of the author or the authors of the epic. One of the very
worst offenders in this way was Pandit Bohtlingk who, in the passages
edited by him in his Scmkrit-Chresthomathie, has ''corrected ” away the
few oddities of idiom and style of the original which had escaped the vigilence
of mediaeval Indian scholiasts and editors and found their way stealthily into
our printed editions

fied as follows. Readings

much in evidence. He has not only introduced, with scrupulous care, the correct
Sandhi wherever it was at all possible, he has substituted the correct bandhum
for the (irregular) huddhum (1. 3.. 21), found even in the printed editions and
made many similar “ corrections independently of the MS. evidence. Most
amusing, however, is his regular and systematic substitution of the correct form,
as required by the Sutra of P§mm, out of etad and enad, a rule probably unknown
at any time to anybody outside a select coterie of AcSryas of Yyakaraoa.

It is an admittedly sound principle of textual criticism to give preference
to a reading which best suggests how the other readings may have arisen, and
it would be hard, I think, to find another reading which^ could explain all
these nine variants more satisfactorily. Winternitz’s choice, for instance,
does not at all explain the origin of any of the readings which contain
mahaltamdk (superl.)' such as 2 (a) and (b) and the text reading ; because
there is in that case nothing to be gained by changing the (supposed) original
comparative into superlative.^

En passant it may be pointed out that the so-called instr. campaTationis
is not a distinct category of the comparative at all ; it is only a special case of
the (Prakritic) coalescence of the instr. and abl. pi. {metri causa), an equi-
valence which comes out very clearly in such parallel phrases as :

I 1. 1. 198

{178} and

1-1- 209 and 494 *.

The latter does not mean he is left by all sins " but “ he is freed from all
sins.”

That the superlative is used in the epic in the sense of the comparative®
may be seen from :

^ % ^Tl^rntfr: \ Gita 12. 1
^ ^ I 18- 69

Of these which are more verged in Yoga ? ” Nor among men shall
there be any whose service is dearer to me than his.”

The superlative is normally construed with the gen. or loc.; but that it is

^ Unless it be a scribe’s error perpetuated through centuries or repeated
independently in different places and times.

2 This pada recurs^ frequently in the Ramayapa also.

» These derivative forms have probably a merely intensive value, and do not
necessarily and invariably connote comparison. The Prakritsl frequently confuse the
tara and the tama endings. It is further worth noting that a separate formation
of the comparative and superlative is unknown to the Modem Indian dialects.
The epics also sporadically furnish instances of the use of the ptmtive in the sense
of the comparative.



EPIC STUDIES II 215

construed sometimes also with the abl. may be seen not merely from the
example last cited but also from :

3Tfq I ibid, 4. 36

Though thou art of all sinners the most sinful/*

Then the above-mentioned equivalence of the instr. and abl. pi. ushers
in finally the construction of the superlative with the instr., which we find
in the passage in question.

Formally the two constructions tava puttair mahattardh and tava ptdrair
mahattamah are almost equivalent ; but there may be just a slight difference
of meaning between the two locutions. While tava puirair mahattamh
(comp.) evidently means only ‘"greater than thy sons’*, the other clause
( tava putrair mahattamdh ) may have been intended to convey some such sense
as “ far, very much, greater than thy sons.**

It may be finally observed that in dealing with the first two adhyayas
of the Adiparvan (a^ in fact with the whole of the earlier portion of this
Parvan ) the critic should never forget that he has before him what Hopkins
has justly called the “ pseudo-epic ** : the poetasters responsible for the com-
pilation of these passages are capable of the worst blunders of every descrip-
tion.

* *

£179} 1. 1. 269 : mdhattvdd bhdravattvdc ca.

As WiNTERNiTZ rightly observes, here the MS. evidence is almost evenly
balanced. Moreover, graphically there is so little difference between the rival
readings that we cannot expect much help from the side of the MSS., though
it may be pointed out that their evidence inclines, if at all, just a trifle to the
side of the text reading. Winternitz {Ind, Ant. 27., 93) admits that the
lines (69*) caturbhyah etc. and tadd prabhjti etc. are “quite superfluous.”
When these lines are expunged from the text, as has been done by me, the
line mahattve ca gurutve ca of 208c) stands adjacent to mahattvdd bhdra''
(of 209<?). The idea of 208c is evidently reflected and repeated in 209a.
Just as mahattvdt corresponds to nidfiattve, so Wmra'' should correspond to
gurutve. This clearly shows, as far as I can judge, that the doubtful woid
(ftfeira®), which should be a paraphrase of gunwft;c, must bt bhdravattvdt
and not bhdratatvdt. The latter seems to be an emendation made by some
revisor who wanted' to squeeze in somehow the significant word Bhdrata into
the context ; and, it must truthfully be confessed, it is a very ingenious emen-
dation indeed. But as to which is the orginal reading there cannot be much
doubt. The importance that Winternitz (like Buhler, Ind. Stud. 2. 9 f.,
before him) attaches to the circumstance that the verse is quoted in (our edi-
tion of) Kumarila's Tahtravartika with the reading bhdratatvdt is wholly un-
justifiable, and that for two reascms : firstly, because we have no critical
edition of the Tantravarttika, and so we cannot be wholly sure of what the



216


EPIC STUDIES


MSS. actually read at that place ; and secondly, because, even if Kumarila
should, in point of fact, have quoted the verse with bhdraiatvM, it does not
at all follow that this is ipsa facta the ariginal reading, notwithstanding that
Kumarila’s work is far older than the extant Mahabharata MSS ; because
Kumarila may have cited the stanza from one or the other of the versions
which contained (and still contain) that reading. Or again he may have
known both variants and preferred, for reasons similar to those adduced by
Buhler and Winternitz, the variant rejected by me.

The situation is somewhat clearer and the facts better capable of demon-
stration in the case of the other great mediaeval commentator Samkaracarya.
In many cases when the readings of the Mahabharata verses and stanzas cited
by him {180} differ from those of the Bombay and Calcutta editions, I was
able to identify i^aihkaraoarya’s readings in the Southern MSS. Being a
Southerner, he had naturally studied and cited from the Southern recension
of the Mahabharata. It is quite clear that he was not going to work through
all available MSS. and establish the original reading of the numerous Maha-
bharata stanzas cited by him in the course of his voluminous commentaries.
Therefore his citations, although of far greater antiquity than the oldest of
our extant Mahabharata MSS., do not necessarily give us in every case the
** original '' readings. Salmkara’s testimony applies to and affects mainly the
version, or the! recension used or cited by him ; and that was probably the
Southern recension in its Malayalam version. Even in the time of the Acarya
the Northern MSS. must have read differently in places, as they do now,
because the divagation of the recensions must be assumed to be far older than
the epoch of the great Vedantist.

I shall give only one example in order to clarify my meaning. 1. 1. 37
of the critical edition reads yathartda rtulingdniy agreeing with other printed
editions and with the majority of the MSS. of the Northern recension. iSam-
karadarya in his Bh^ya on the Brahmasutra (1. 3. 30 ; Anandasrama ed.,
p. 313) cites, however, the verse with the reading yalthartu^v jtulingdni.^
Now this reading is found only in Southern MSS. and in such of the Northern
MSS. as can be shown to be contaminated from the Southern source, but not
in any Kasmlri or Bangali MSS. collated so far. Here it would be clearly
wrong to cite the Bh^ya as an authority older than our MSS. to establish
the text reading as yathartu^v rtulingdni. The Bh^ya citation affects directly
the Southern version only, documenting that the divergent reading of our
Southern MSS. is as old as (or rather older than) the time of Sairhkaracarya ;
and that is aU. It does not take us beyond the Southern recension, much
less beyond the two rival recensions to the archetype.

When Winternitz further observes that “ from the etymologizer's point
of view ” hharatatvdt is a ** better ” etymology, since with the other reading


1 Only one of the Bhasya MSS. has our text reading.



EPIC STUDIES 11


217


the ta of the Bharata remains unexplained, he is bringing into the discussion
an element of finesse that is quite foreign to the view-point of £181} the
Puraijic writers, as will be evident from the following specimens of “etymo-
logische Spielerei ” culled from the earlier adhyayas of the Adiparvan :

(B.) 1. 30. 7 = line 3 of 343* (Garuda) :

1. 36. 3 (Jaratkaru) :

1. 56. 31 (Mahabharata) :

1. 69. 33 (Bharata) ;

In view of these bizarre specimens, it would be extremely strange should
a Puraoic “ etymologizer " fight shy of sacrificing a /la, if he, for the mcwment,
could not think of anything better.


1. 2. 2 : susrusa yadi vo viprd bruvatas ca kathdh subhdfj.

I admit that my reconstruction of the line is not wholly satisfactory.
The reading preferred by WiNTERNiTZ may also not appeal to other scholars,
as it does not wholly appeal to me. I therefore cite here the 15 different
readings found in the 48 MSS. collated for this passage, of which one (Dg),
unluckily or luckily, omits the line altogether. The lines containing ca (to
which WiNTERNiTZ takes exception in particular) have been underlined for
the sake of ready identification.

£182} As for the doubtful ca, I may remark that, besides its normal
use as a conjunction meaning and ”, ca is very frequently used in the Maha-
bhSrata (and the RamSyaioa) as an expletive, a pure and simple verse-filler
ipadapuratj^i) ^ without restriction of position, like hi and vai. It may occa-
sionally have served as a particle of emphasis, stressing the previous word
like eva. The second use is somewhat doubtful ; but of the first, one can find
scores of perfectly clear and certain instances in any portion of the epic, even
in the printed editions. In the line in question, I consider, ca has
been used in the first sense, as a mere verse-filler. Sporadically tm, which
improves this awkward line ever so slightly, appears to have been substituted
for it, independently in both recensions. The first half of the line was so
uncouth that it was recast in the vulgatei. There are numerous instances of
lines being recast ip the vulgate, as a careful study of the critical apparatus
will show.

      dkhydsye Mra Pmlomam dkhydna^ cdditah param jj

This is again al most difficult case, and, as Winternitz rightly remarks,
” full of almost hopeless editorial cruces”. The reconstruction would be,
therefore, almost entirely a matter of speculation. Winternitz has rightly
surmised that I regard the Parvasaiiigraha as an accretion later than this
stanza, which, in my opinion, belongs to a much earlier stratum of the text
of the Mahabharata. That Samakasatre in line 1 is a regular trap for the
unwary. Misled by the printed editions, I had myself treated the words as
separate at first, realizing only much later that in this adhyaya the Suta is
addressing not Satinaka but the IJ§is, among whom iSaunaka is not
yet present. iSaunaka is not mentioned in the foregoing portion of the text
except once, in connection with his twelve-year sacrifice in 1. 1. 1. In
adhyaya 4, moreover, it is plainly stated that the Suta first approaches the
IJ§is assembled in thei Naimi§a forest and asks them what he should narrate.
The Iil§is request him to await the arrival of i^unaka. The latter, as soon
as he arrives, asks the Suta to relate the history of the Bhiargavas (adhy. 5).
If Saunaka was not afcmong the audience in adhySya 4, I do not see how he
could have been there in adhyaya 2. Moreover, Tn the latter adhyaya the in-
terlocutors are throu^out stated as being the IJ§is, while it is only from
adhyaya 5 onwards that iSaunaka appears in this £183} role. It should,
therefore, seem that the reading &aunaka satre is not easy to understand or
explain by any means. Or does Winternitz mean that it should be adopted
as the lectio diffidlior ? It would be admissible, in my opinion, only on the
supposition (which is not as improbable as it may at first si^t appear) that



EPIC STUDIES II


219


the compiler of adhyaya 2, when he wrote stanza 29, had overlooked the fact
that Saunaka was not then among the audience. I have preferred to give
the “ poet ” the benefit of the doubt and assume that the remark is addressed
to one of the Rsis i>resent.

WiNTERNiTZ has misunderstood my reconstruction in some other parti-
culars as well, yat, at the beginning of the stanza, is not a neuter pronoun
but an adverb = yada. The words aditah param offer no difficulties at all
for interpretation ; Sdital}. does not mean “ /row the beginning,” but “ at the
beginning” {=adau) ; param excellent.” dkhyasye must of course be
supplied in the first line ; but that is not difficult as it is the very first word
of the second line. Therefore I translate :

“ But when, during Saunaka’s (sacrificial) session, I (shall narrate) to
thee the very extensive Bh5rata Story, then shall I narrate, to begin with, the
excellent Story of Pauloma."

Even a cursory examination of the variants given in the critical notes is
sufficient to convince anybody that the stanza has been recast over and over
again. With, its history is bound up the history of the successive additions
of the three episodes AstOca, Pauloma and Pausya, which appear to have
been aH)ended successively to the main text in this order. The stanza in
question seems to have been written at the time of or soon after the addition of
the Pauloma, but before the addition of the Pausya. The purpose of the line
was originally not— as Winternitz imagines— to state all the episodes with
which the MahabhSrata begins, but to authenticate the latest interpolation
then made, namely, the Pauloma, by making the Suta declare beforehand his
intenti<Mi of narrating that akhyana at the beginning of the Mahabharata.
The .Astika must have formed at that time the recognized beginning of the
epic (cf. Mtptvadi Bhdratam kecid Astikddi tathd pare 1. 1. 50), and the
Pausya had not yet been added. This is the state of things the constituted
text envisages.

A study of the critical apparatus of this adhyaya shows that the adhySya
is best preserved in the Southern recension ; £184} in the MSS. group on
which the vulgate is mainly based (namely, BD) numerous additional stanzas
are found which are missing in S and Ko. j, « ; but even the three latter MSS.
occasionally indude some of such additional stanzas, which also nevertheless,
since they are missing in S, may safely be regarded as interpolations. Of this
character is interpolation 74*, which is found in almost the whole of N and
which must have been made with a view to documenting the fact— or rather
the fiction — ^that the MahSbhfirata as narrated by the Suta to tSaunaka was
identical with that narrated by Vai^ampSyana to Janamejaya (cf. Nilakaptka
ad loc.). Ko. 1 agree with S cm the reading of this stanza except for the in-
clusion of 74* in the one and the addition of the name of the Astika to the



220


EPIC STUDIES


Other. The text is formed by collating S with the inferable version of K
before the addition in the latter of 74*. The subsequent steps leading to-
walrds the reading of the vulgate consisted in the addition of the name of the
Astika episode (which intervenes between the Pauloma and the beginning
proper of the Mahabharata ) , of a statement of the identity of the Suta-
version and the Vai^a)rhpayana version, and finally of the name of the Pau§ya
interlude, all these changes being made in our stanza with a view to setting
the seal of authenticity on the three spurious additions. That adhyaya 3
must be an interpolation follows from the fact that it is wholly unconnect^
with the previous adhyaya and only loosely connected with what follows.
Noteworthy is also the fact that adhyayas 1 and 4 have the same beginning ;
Lomahursanctputra Ugrasravah sutah paurdniko Naimi^dranye dvddasavdr-
sike satre ! And in the text itself there is no explanation why after the Suta
has finished his narration of the Pau§ya episode, it is necessary to reintroduce
the Suta in the same words as approaching the same R§is assembled at the
same twelve-year sacrificial session of .^aunaka in the Naimi§a forest. There
is clearly a new beginning made in one of the two adhyayas.

Since many of the intermediate links are missing in the MS. evidence, it
is not possible to reconstruct the history of this portion of the text fully and
satisfactorily ; but that it must be reconstructed on the lines sketched above,
I have no doubt. Accordingly the successive stages in the development of
the reading of the vulgate (which is the reading preferred by Winternitz)
I would arrange in a scheme like the following, in which the innovations have
been printed in black type. £185} It will show anwng other things that the
vistmam of the text and of the Southern recension is not “ a remnant of vis-
tardrtham ” of the vulgate ; on the contrary, in the latter the first line was fill-
ed up with uttamam when the original vist\a7a was used in the interpolated
stanza. The view of Winternitz that at least Astlkam must remain in the
text is quite untenable ; because if the stanza had As^kam there is no reason
why it should not have Pau^yam as well. On the other hand, if Pausyam is
not indispensable, then Astlkam could go with it as well.

1. 2. 46 : mrgasvapnahhaymi Mah

Here again Winternitz prefers the reading of the \ailgate {mrgasvap-
nodbhavam) . It is clearer but, I must say, I am very doubtful about its
originality. The MS. support for this variant is only slightly stronger than
that for the reading of the constituted text. It is worthy of note that B,
which generally sides with the vulgate, has here a third and entirely different
reading : rnjgosvapno 'bhavat tatab I How would Winternitz account for
that ? I explain the compound of the constituted text as an irregular com-
pound with inverted sequence, common in Prakrit (PiscHEL, Gramm, der
Prakrit’Spracheft, §603)! and not unknown to the Low Sanskrit of the epics.
Hopkins, /AOS. 20 (1890X, 223, has cited two instances from the Rami-
yaaja : 7.22.36 dfstvu dandodyatam Yaman (for j 44 yatadan(}am)“ like Yama
with upraised staff” ; and ibid. 7. 26. 2 tulyaparvatmarcasi (for parvata-
tulyavm^asi) “glorious like the mountain (Kailasa).” I accordingly take
the compound in question as equivalent to svapna (df^la) mrgabhaymi
“ (Parvan) in which! there is the fright of the deer (seen) in a dream”
(cf. the compound Svapnmmavadattkm) . Yudhi§th1ra, in any case, was

The readings of the vulgate and the Bangali version seem to represent
different attempts at emendation of the irregular con>pound which stood
originally in the Northern recension and which was perhaps misunderstood,
if it was not totally unintelligible. The wavy line below the pada was called
for also by the variant reading of S, which has parva or talah) prdyopa-
vesmam. This refers to an entirely different section of £187} the narrative,
the name being derived from the vow of fasting taken by Duryodhana.

1 . 2. 89 : tathd rdjydrdhasdsamm.

The variants are ""sdsanam, °lambhmmi, ""sarjanam (vulgate),
liam, °pddanam, '"ddpamm ! If rdjydrdkasarjamm corresponds better to
one portion of the contents of Adip. 207, °sdsm^m may be said to corres]>ond
'etter to a subsequent portion of the same adhyaya ; ’^sarjanam was followed
oy °sdsmam. Intrinsically there is not much to choose between the two.
The sub-parvan name is really something quite different : Tdjyalctmbha or
^Idbha, which has given rise to the reading of K 3 rdjydfdh^tlambhanam.
The reading preferred by Winternitz is found only in the vulgate group
supported by four Southern MSS. ^ Mj. 3 ^ The text reading was adopted
on the direct testimony of Ko. « Do 0 , hut it has partial support of T^, and
of two K MSS. (Kj. 2 )> one of which is the important India Office codex
(Ki). These MSS. (Ki. 2 ) as a matter of fact rdjydnusdsanam, but
the nu of these MSS, is obviously wrong (perhaps representing a mislection
the ligature rdhc), being opposed by the remainder of the MS. material
collated and conveying no satisfactory sense. There appears to be an agree-
ment between independent versions on the reading '^sarjanam, but the con-
cord, I believe, is only apparent, being due to the conflation of MSS. That
G 4 . 5 are contaminated from some late Northern source, I think, I have esta-
blished with tolerable certainty in the note on 1 . 20 . 1 ; the conclusion is cor-
roborated by many less certain instances where these MSS. (along with Gi. y)
agree with Northern MSS, against other Southern MSS., and the agreement
cannot be regarded as one derived from their connection through the arche-
type.^ That further G^ and Mj are not reliable representatives of the
Grantha and the Malayalam versions respectively, I have already pointed out
in the Foreword to Fascicule 1 (p. v). There remains only one other MS.
(M3), which represents a moderately pure (Malayalam) tradition and must

tion of the reading of the vulgate.

Graphically there is no connection between the conflicting readings. The
reading of the vulgate is found in only one MS. of the K group (K4), an
inferior conflated MS. It will thus be seen that the MS. evidence is utterly
confused, l^at being so, I have adopted the reading °sd&mam, giving pre-
ference to the side on which the majority of K stand, according to a prirKiplc

1. 2. 96 : In the Editorial Note appended to Fascicule 3, I have given
      my reasons for selecting 7984 as the figure representing the number of slokas
      in the Adiparvan. That is the figure given by the India Office MS. (Kj
      and corroborated by the i^rada codex (iSJ. It may, therefore, be regarded
      as the extent of the Sarada version at any rate. I consider, as I have fre-
      quently stated, the Sarada (Kasmiri) version the best version now preserved,
      and my edition of the Adiparvan is based mainly (though not wholly) on
      this version.

I fully agree with Winternitz (op, cit. p. 61) that the Parvasariigraha
argument is necessarily of secondary importance and should not be pressed
too far.^ Be that as it may, it is extremely problematic whether we could
make any use whatsoever of the Parvasarhgraha enumeration in the case of
the Adiparvan at least, because it will be difficult to compute the exact extent
of this Parvan, and that for two reasons. Firstly, because this Parvan, as is
well known, contains two lengthy prose adhyayas (3 and 90) ; and it is diffi-
cult to say {189} now how the extent of the prose sections was computed by
the compilers of the Parvasarhgraha ; our section-numbers certainly can give
no indication of the extent in Slokas.'’- Secondly, this Par\^an also contains

^ The exaggerated importance Utgikar attached to the data of the Parvasam-
graha was, I believe, mainly due to his erroneous belief (induced probably by the
misleading character of the text of the Kumbhakonam edition) that the Northern
and Southern MSS. agreed completely with each other in all material particulars
for this acfliyaya. The Kumbhakonam edition, which claims to be an edition
“ mainly based on the South Indian texts ”, presents a text of this adhyaya which
is almost identical with that of the Calcutta and Bombay editions, taking no notice
of the Southern divergences, while in other sections of the epic it introduces numer-
ous innovations which are based on the Southern tradition.

® The lengths of the prose sections must have been computed on the basis of
32 ak^a^c^ to a slok’a, but such a computation in the cas^ of long prose sections can
be only approximate.



224


EPIC STUDIES


a large number of Tri§tubh-Jagati stanzas, which again introduce an element
of uncertainty in the computation. Was each Tri^ubh-Jagatl stanza counted
as one iSloka ” or did the Bh^ratacintakas compute the exact equivalent of
these long-metre stanzas in “ Slokas ? No definite answer is possible as yet.
The difference in the reckoning will be, however, between 40 and 50 per cent
of the total. As a very rough estimate, the Adiparvan may contain some-
thing like 500 long-metre stanzas. This factor alone would then introduce
a difference of a little less than 250 “ :§lokas in the total !

We must, moreover, not lose sight of the fact that the reading of the
number itself is never entirely free from doubt, since the MSS., as Winter-
NiTZ remarks, differ sometimes quite essentially in the Parvasamgraha itself ;
the figures differ not by units or tens, but by hundreds, and even thousands in
extreme cases.^ There can be no doubt, as I have pointed out elsewhere,
that the text of the Parvasamgraha has been tampered with and designedly
altered, in various ways, in order to make it harmonize with the inflated ver-
sions of a later epoch.^

These are some of the difficulties in the way of making any practical
use of the figures recorded in the Parvasamgrahaparvan for fixing the text of
the Mahabhiarata. The computations may have some value for a Parvan
in which there is no prose at all, which is almost wholly in Anu§tubh metre,
and for which finally the Parvasaaiigraha figure is tolerably certain.

It is quite within the range of probability, as far as I can judge now,
that the extent of the critical text of a pa<rvan may {190} fall appreciably
below or rise appreciably above the figure recorded in the second adhyaya, as
is actually the case with about half the number of Parvans in the Calcutta,
Bombay and Kumbhakonam editions when checked up with the figures given
in their respective Parvasairhgrahas.^ Moreover, unless it can be made prob-
able that the compilation of this “ Table of Contents ” is nearly synchronous
with the final redaction of the Great Epic, this discrepancy will be without
any cogency in questions relating to the constitution of the text. The value
of a MS. or a version cannot be said to depend exclusively or even mainly
upon its agreement with or discrepancy from the data of the Parvasamgraha.
It must, in the first analysis, be regarded as depending upon some intrinsic
criteria, upon the place it occupies in a logical and convincing scheme formu-


1 Thus for the Vii^taparvan, the Northern figure is 2050, the Southern 3500 ;
the difference therefore is 1450 41okas.

2 Cf. the Editorial Note (2) appended to Fascicule 3 (p. iii).

2 The actual number of ^lokas falls belotv the Parvasamgraha figure in the
following 10 Parvans : Adi, Udyoga, Bhi§ma, Sauptika, iS^nti, Anusasana, Mva-
medhika, AiramavSsika, Mausala and Mahaprasthanika ; while it rises above the
other figure in the following 8 Parvans : Sabha, Araijya, VirSfa, Dropa, Kanja,
Salya, Stri, and Svarg^rohaaja.



EPIC STUDIES II 225

lated to explain satisfactorily the evolution of the different extant versions
and types of Mahabharata MSS.

It should further be carefully borne in mind that even if there is an exact
agreement as to extent between a constituted text and the Parvasamgraha*
this fact alone is no guarantee of the originality and the absolute correctness
of the entire text, line for line ; because the same number of stanzas could be
made up in innumerable different ways by accepting or rejecting, hesitatingly,
stanzas of doubtful authenticity and uncertain documentation, of which there
will always be a plentiful supply in every Parvan.^ The difficulty will finally
not be solved even if we happen to light upon a unique MS. which agrees
with the Parvasalrhgraha exactly and we should adopt its text verbatim ;
because there is every probability that while it satisfies the one criterion of
extent given by the Parvasalrhgraha, it may not satisfy, in every respect, other
and more exacting critical tests when compared, line by line and word by
word, with other extant MSS.

£191} 1. 2. 105 : paurmugamanam caiva dharmaputrasya dhimakih.

WiNTEiJsiiTZ is mistaken in thinking that the line is missing in the whole
of K : it is missing in only two MSS. of the group, albeit the best MSS.
These MSS. (Kq. j) are, however, by no means infallible, as a careful study
of the apparatus will show. Their evidence is, therefore, rebuttable and not
conclusive. In this instance, not only does the line occur in the rest of N,
but there is a corresponding line in S. I cannot think that the two lines : —
Text . paurmugamanam cairn dhar7naputrasya dlnmatah
S (except Ml) : paurdnukampd nirvedo dharmardjasyak dhlmatah

could have arisen wholly independently of each other. Even though the pur-
port of the lines is different, the construction is identical, which is a very
important point in its favour. Either these lines are connected through the
archetype, or else there is wholesale contamination between S and N except
Ko. 1 . The latter contingency being improbable in the extreme, we are led
to conclude that there must have been a line of that description in the ori-
ginal ; only its precise reading is doubtful ; the doubtful words have accord-
ingly been indicated in the usual manner.

* * * 

The problem of the MahaWr^ta textual criticism, as I have pointed
out already, is a problem sui generis. Here the principles of textual recon-
struction, which must first be evolved from a study of the MS. material and
the MS. tradition, can be considered as finally settled only after considerable
discussion and exchange of ideas on the subject. I would, therefore, earn-
estly request Prof. Winternitz to continue his searching and exhaustive

examination of the fascicules as they are issued and publish periodically the
results of his scrutiny, a proceeding which cannot but throw much- needed
light on at least some of the difficult problems the editors have to face, and
thus advance the cause of Mahabharata studies.

## Dr. Ruben on the Critical Edition of the Malwbharata

I am bound to form and express an opinion on the issues raised in the
article Schwierigkeiten der Textkritik des Mahafcrfiarata published in the
current issue of the Acta Orimtalia (vol 8. pp. 240-256), in which the
author, Dr. Walter Ruben of the University of Bonn, has reviewed Fasci-
cules 1-3 of tny edition of the Adiparvan, criticizing at considerable length
and in great detail the principles underlying the preparation of the edition
and the constitution of the text.

From his discursive remarks it is indeed hazardous to say what precise
opinion Ruben has formed of the critical edition. But it seems to me that
his general verdict is anything but favourable.

It is not my intention to scrutinize every statement of the writer and
answer all his queries and criticisms ; nor is it incumbent on me to do so ; nor
even necessary, as will appear from the sequel. I shall confine my remarks
to a few points of outstanding importance in Ruben's paper which might mis-
lead the casual reader, creating an erroneous impression regarding the value
of the results achieved by the critical edition.

♦ * ♦

The Bogey of Classical Philology

At the beginning of his paper (p. 241), the learned reviewer from Bonn
formally recites the canon of the caturvarga of the Classical Philologist. The
Classical Philology, we are explained, distinguishes : 1. Heuristics, i.e. as-
sembling and arranging the entire material consisting of MSS. and testi-i
monia in the form of a genealogical tree ; 2. Recensio, i.e. restoration of the
text of the archetype ; 3. Etnendatio, i.e. restoration of the text of the author ;
4. “ Higher Criticism,” i.e. separation of the sources utilized by the author.

£260} Tested on this touchstone of the classicist, the critical edition
of the Mahabharata is found wanting in no less than three items, namely,
Nos. 1, 3 and 4. The third and the fourth items of the programme, R. pdnts
out, have been left wholly untouched ; even the first has by a long way not
been done full justice to by the hapless editor But as one reads on, one
finds that the dereliction is after all not as serious as one might be led to

1 R. has inadvertently omitted the mention of the 23 Elevanagaii MSS. in

tom.

suppose at first. For, as regards No. 1 (Heuristics), R. himself admits that
it is not yet possible to concentrate the entire material, and that in all likeli-
hood it will be for ever impossible to prepare a genealogical tree of the
Mahabharata MSS. — As for No. 3 (Emendaiia), I must plead guilty to
having perpetrated so far, perhaps somewhat unnecessarily, minor emenda-
tions in 13 instances^ in about 3800 stanzas ; that is, on an average 1 emen-
dation in a little under 300 stanzas, R. has not taken any notice of my con-
jectural corrections ; I take it that he approves of them. I feel greatly flat-
tered, I must confess, by R/s (implied) suggestion that I should have gone
in more systematically and vigorously for emendation. Most scholars will,
I fancy, be sincerely grateful that I have been so moderate and that I have
declared it as my policy to give preference to interpreitation over emenda-
tion.^ — In speaking at all of “ Higher Criticism” (No. 4 on the programme)
in this connection, R. seems to show a lamentable lack of understanding of
the objective of the edition, having mistaken evidently the beginning for the
end of the critical work on the Mahiabharata. Higher Criticism can begin
only after Lower Criticism has done its work, and not until then. And our
critical edition is just laying the foundation of the Lower Criticism of the
Great Epic. But I imagine, R. does not want to say anything special at all.
when he mentions his “Hohere Kritik'’. In the 1833 ^okas of the consti-
tuted text (!=2161 of the Bombay edition and 2208 of the Calcutta edition)
so closely investigated by R. in the preparation of his erudite paper, he does
not mention even a single passage where the ” Hohere Kritik ” could have
{261} earnestly and usefully ” functioned The item is probably introduced
here merely pro jorma, as the fourth and last stage of the ariya-magga.

But R. might have mercifully spared us this learned prooemium on the
aims and methods of the Classical Philology and their application to the
problem of the Mahabh^ata textual criticism. The same thing has been
said by others before R., more simply but with ample clearness and emphasis.
In the paper^ he read at the XVI Ith International Congress of Orientalists
(Oxford 1928), Winternitz remarked : “The general principles followed in
critical editions of classical texts, Greek or Latin or Sanskrit, can be applied
to a critical edition of the Mahiabharata only with great limitations and
modifications. It is simply impossible to trace a genealogical tree of all the
MSS. of the Adiparvan, and only in some cases are we able to state how
MSS. are related to one another. On the whole, we have to be satisfied with
a classification of the MSS. according to script, and the provinces to which
they belong. And we have more often to refer to classes of MSS., than to

individual MSS/'^ I had myself pointed out in the Foreword (p. ii) to
Fa^cule 1 that “ it is impossible to apply to the Mahabharata the special
canons of textual criticism which are derived from a study of classical (Greek
and Latin) texts and which depend ultimately upon there being a more or
less complete concatenation of copies and exemplars reaching finally back
to a single authentic (written) archetype'’.

And how would it be possible to apply to the Mahabharata the canons
of the Classical Philology in toto ? Where has the Classical Philology, I
should like to know, the necessary experience of dealing with a text with
about a dozen recensions whose extreme types differ in extent by something
like 13,000 stanzas (or 26,000 lines) ; a work which for centuries has been
growing not only upwards and downwards but also laterally, like the Nyag-
rodha tree, growing on all sides ; a codex which has been written in seven
or eight different scripts, assiduously and lovingly copied through a long
vista of centuries by a legion of devout — and perhaps mostly ignorant
{262} and inefficient^ — copyists speaking different tongues ; a traditional book
of inspiration which, in various shapes and sizes, has been the cherished
heritage of one people continuously for several millennia and which to the
present day is interwoven with the thoughts and beliefs and moral ideas of a
nation numbering over two hundred million? No, the Classical Philology
has no experience in dealing with a text of this description, a work of such
colossal dimensions and complex character, with such a long and intricate
history behind it. That is why I have elsewhere also said that the problem
of the Mahabharata textual criticism is a problem sui generis.^ The method
of the Mahabharata textual criticism must be evolved from a special study
of the Mahabharata manuscripts and of the Mahabharata manuscript tradi-
tion. Its results and achievements can be judged only by a standard of its
own.

Ruben’s Exaggerations and Generalizations

In his endeavour to maintain consistently an attitude of dogmatic doubt,
R. has been unconsciously led to make wild exaggerations and rash generali-
zations, which such a meticulous and captious critic as R. should have taken
pains to avoid.

Thus in one place (p. 242), R, observes that the iSarada MS., as a mat-
ter of fact, does not differ at all from other MSS. ! As a matter of fact,
this stat^ent of R. is demonstrably false. If a difference of something like
1000 stanzas (which is probably the difference between the garada and tt.e

Grantha versions of the Adiparvan), not to speak of innumerable minor var-
iants, is no difference, I should like to know what, in the opinion of R.,
would constitute a difference. Did R. expect that the Kasmiri Mahabharata
would be a poem of 8800 slokas in Old Prakrit in which Krsna was still a
tribal hero ?

On p. 253, R. remarks that every contextual criterion is problematic.’ This
is a rash generalization. In the Editorial Note (3) appended to Fasciaale
4, I have now pointed out (p. ii f.) three passages for which there is the
strongest in- {263} -trinsic probability, amounting to certainty, that they are
interpolations in the recension in which they are found. All three are instan-
ces in which according to the Northern recension the parties to be married were
united only by a shadowy and clandestine form of marriage known as the
Gandharva-vivaha, which is no marriage at all, while according to the Sou-
thern recension (respectively, in one case, the Grantha version c«ily) the
same parties were married, so to say, in church, in due form, with great pomp
and ceremony. I .maintain that at least in these three instances the crite-
rion of the intrinsic probability is not at all problematic. I challenge R. to
prove the contrary.

I shall mention only one other interesting instance of intrinsic proba-
bility. In the Paulomaparvan, Ruru, while praying for the life of his wife,
who has just died from the bite of a venomous serpent, says (1. 9. 4-5) :

“ If I have (practised) charity, (if I have) practised penance, if I have
duly served (my) Gurus, then on account of that (merit of these virtuous
acts) let my beloved be restored to life ! As from (the moment of) my birth
I have restrained myself and maintained my vows, so let the beautiful Pra-
madvara even now arise ! ”

The fulfilment of Rum’s fervent utterance is thought to be due merely
to the efficacy of his pious acts in the past : they by themselves operate as
a charm or spell to restore to life the dead Pramadvara. This is a form of
an impersonal ” prayer belonging to a comparatively older stratum of reli-
gious life and thought, which would never occur to an ordinary interpolator.
At this place, Gj. 2. 4 r, have some additional lines including the following
prayer (233*).

“ If my faith in Kr§|ija, Vi§nu, Hr§ike^, the Lord of the Worlds, the
Foe of the Asuras, unshakable, then let this beloved of mine be restored to
life !

This belongs to a later stratum, the period of the Bhakti cult. This is
just the thing that would be interpolated by a devout Vaisnava, to whom the
former prayer would be meaningless and unintelligible.

I maintain that here also the intrinsic probability as to what is original

and what is interpolation is so strong as to be conclusive in favour of the text
and against G j. 2 . 4 . 5 - No £264} one with a modicum of the historical sense
can doubt it. Can R. adduce even a shadow of a reason to show that the
intrinsic evidence in this insitance is in any degree problematic? Scores of
illustrations of this character may be produced where the contextual evidence
is not problematic at all, but quite definite and conclusive.^

R. (p. 254) has magnanimously set the seal of his approval on “Die
Sage von Rsyasrhga by Professor Luecrs ® citing it approvingly as a piece
of investigation that belongs to the coveted domain of emendetio. It is un-
questionably that. Had R. now thought over the question a little more
deeply than he appears to have done, he would have easily perceived that
the whole thesis of “ Die Sage von R§ya^ga ” rests on the exploitation of in-
trinsic probability. There was, in fact, nothing else except the vulgate text
before Prof. Lum:rs when he framed his brilliant hypothesis about the diffe-
rent strata and the cross-currents in the Mahabharata version of that l^end.
If now every contextual criterion is so very problematic, then what is the va-
lue, may I ask, of Prof. Luders’s monograph, which R. professes to admire so
fervently? R. has been contradicting himself in one and the same para-
graph (p. 253 f.).

Theoretically considered also, R.*s proposition is untenable. When a text
has been tampered with on a large scale, however careful and however ac-
complished the interpolator may be, it is inconceivable that all the frills,
patches and paddings added by the interpolator should remain for all time
incapable of detection. It is inevitable that the interpolator should bungle
something somewhere, produce a misfit, leave raw edges which do not meet.
Therefore R.'s dictum (p. 253) “ebenso problematisch ist schliesslich ;c-
de^ inhaltliche Kriterium” is, in the form in which he has put it, funda-
mentally wrong and is to be unhesitatingly rejected.

Here is another instance of R.’s misstatdnents. On p. 242 he observes
that among the fifty MSS. collated for the Adiparvan £265} there are not
even two that may be directly connected with each other. This is of course
a wild exaggeration. The two Arjunami^ra MSS. show inter se no more
difference than any two (carelessly made) copies of an original would show ;
as a matter of fact— but this could not have been known to R.— they agree
almost page for page. If they were not copied from the same original, their
respective exemplars could not have differed from each other very consider-


^ For instance, it is on grounds of intrinsic probability that Prof. LOders
{DLZ^ Heft 24, Sp. 1142 f.) decides for and defencte the reading amytam of the
constituted t&ct (1. 1. 201). Here the documentary evidence is inoonclumve, but

ably. The same is the case with the three Nilakai^tha MSS. The MSS. of
the text as fixed by commentators (like Arjunami^ra and NUakaotha) are,
in general, as like as two peas. The number of such replicas can be increased
almost indefinitely. I have intentionally restricted their number to the mini-
mum necessary for fixing the text of the respective versions, always giving
preference to a divergent type. But even apart from such texts with com-
mentaries, there is considerable similarity and kinship to be noticed among
the different MSS. In the Editorial Note (2) appended to Fascicule 3
(p. ii), I have demonstrated the kinship between and K^. I pointed out
there that “the India Office codex must be a transcript not merely of a
iSarada codex, but, as a careful comparison with Sj would show, of an ex-
emplar very closely allied to mr fSarada codex This conclusion is supported
by numerous other agreements throughout the Adiparvan. That the three
new Malayalam MSS. M^. s again go back to the same original follows
not merely from the numerous readings these MSS. have in common, but
conspicuously from one particular mistake where they repeat inconsequen-
tially, at the same point, a fragment of a stanza (1. 85. 25) : pujayantlha loke
ndsddhava}}. Further the four Grantha MSS. Gj. 2. 4. u. (which will come
up for detailed discussion below) must go back to a not very distant com-
mon original. This group has not only numerous readings in common, but
it contains quite a considerable numbef of interpolations peculiar to itself.^
Their close affinity is, however, placed beyond the pale of reasonable doubt
by the fact that they all contain a stanza (294*) interpolated at a place where
it is, as will presently be shown, so thoroughly irrelevant that with it the pas-
sage does not construe even !

It will thus be seen that these generalizations of R. are absolutely un-*
warranted. They appear to have been introduced £266} by R, merely for
the satisfaction of having made some pointed and effective little statement.

The Four Types of Variants.

After pointing out that no pedigree of the Mahabharata MSS. is pos-
sible, R. proceeds (p. 243) to consider the different types of characteristic
combinations £tmong the variants, whose consideration must take the place
of the formation of the usual genealogical tree. He distinguishes four diffe-
rent types of constellations. They are as follows : 1. Complete Agree-

ment, where tlie two recensions N and S register one concordant reading ;
2. No Agreement, where N and S stand opposite to each other with two
   divergent readings ; 3. Cross- Agreement, where a part of N agrees with a
   part of S against the rest of N, which latter agrees with the r^t of S ; 4.
   Partial Agreement, where a part of N stands against S and the rest of N (or
   vice versa).

Diagrammatically the four types of constellations may be represented

thus.

N = S

Type No. 2 : No Agreement :

N

Type No. 3 : Cross- Agreement :


Type No. 4 : Pmtial Agreement :

N, .No 1 N.
s/ 1 s,\so


Type No. 1 (N=S). In this case 1 have assumed that the concordant
reading of N and S must be postulated as having already belonged to the
archetype. To my proposition R. adds the rider that there is a possibility
that even such a concordant reading (or feature) might have been an inno-
vation made in one recension and then borrowed in toto by the other recen-
sion. He cites (p. 244) Ramiyana, Ayodhya 6 (Bombay ed.), which (ac-
cording to R.) is an interpolation in one recension, which had been borrowed
en bloc by the other (independent) recension. R.’s proposition would be a
contradiction in terms ; only he takes care not to put forward the proposition
in this form.

If the two recensions N and S of the Mahabharata should have an in-
terpolation in common, they would not be (truly) independent. But these
recensions must be assumed to be independent, and R. would not be able to
prove any second-{267}ary interrelationship ” between N as a whole and
S as a whole, at least for the Adiparvan. Should there be found a passage
which stands in such an apparent disagreement with the context that it may
(a priori) be regarded as an interpolation, it would be no more difficult-
in fact it would be, in my opinion, far easier and much more natural— to as-
sume that the contradiction was already present in the archetype,” before
the bifurcation of the recensions than to premise that one independent re-
cension had borrowed it from another independent recension.

For example, adhyayas 1 and 4 of the Adiparvan begin with the iden-
tical sentence, depicting the identical situation, that the Suta approaches the
R§is assembled in the Naimi^a forest at the twelve-year sacrificial session of
Saunaka. This implies that a new beginning is made at adhyiaya 4, totally
ignoring whatever has gone before it in the text as it now stands. Both pas-
sages occur with minimal variations in both recensions. It is evident that
this double b^inning (adhy. 1 and 4), as we find it in our version of the
Mahabharata, was not conceived and depicted by one and the same poet.
But it does not at all follow therefore that the interpolation was first made
in one recension of our text and was subsequently borrowed by the other
from this recension. There are various possibilities.^ Perhaps both versions

of the beginning lay before the diaskaiasts of the last redaction of the Ma-
liabharata : one giving the very useful table of contents, the other containing
some interesting old tales of gods, IJ§is and serpents. They were not consistent
in juxtaposition, but each was too good to lose. The redactors put both in,
making but a poor compromise. This is one possibility. The other possi-
bility is that one of these sections was composed and tacked on to an existing
version of the beginning by the diaskeuasts of the last redaction themselves,
using the same opening device. That would only show — ^as R. himself con-
cedes in another connection (p. 254) — ^that though we might regard the ori-
ginal epic as a more or less homogeneous £268} work, the archetype of our
MSS. already contained some inconsistencies and contradictions.^

Type No. 2 (N#S). I agree with R. that when there is a conflict between
N and S and they stand opposite to each other with two divergent readings,
no definite decision is, in general, possible as to which is the original ; the
versions should a priori be placed on an equal footing and treated with im-
partiality Accordingly, in such cases, I have adopted as stop-gap the
reading of N, placing a wavy line below it, to show that the reading is uncer-
tain. R. mentions an exception to this procedure of mine, but
the exception is only apparent. R. has failed to understand my motives in
departing from my usual practice in the solitary instance of the benedic-
tory stanza with which the epic begins {Nardyaf^am nama^krtya etc.). I
have printed it above the line not because it is found in K o.i or in K or even
in N, but simply as a mahgala. I am aware that the stanza is missing in S.
There is, therefore, every probability that it did not belong to the archer
type. I am also fully aiware that the stanza is a characteristic mark of the
works of the Bhagavata sect and not peculiar to the Mahabharata.^ There is,
however, the fact that all our MSS. of the Adiparvan begin with some bene-
dictory stanza. These stanzas have probably iisurped now the place of some
simpler mahgala with which the epic once began. No orthodox Hindu work
can begin without a mahgala ; and this edition of the Mahiabharata, critical
though it be, is and remains a Hindu work, which could not dispense w^lh


1 For instance, the story of the birth of Bhi^ma contains a patent contradic-
tion. The reason why the Vasus were cursed by Vaisi§tha as given in adhy. 91
( 1 = 96 of the Bombay text) is quite different from and inconsistent with that
given in adhy. 93 (=99 of the Bombay text). Both versions occur, in substan-
tially identical form, in both recensions.— Cf. also the passage regarding the eight
forms of marriage (1. 67. 8-12) in the 8akuntala episode. The passage is made
up of two different and mutually inconsistent systems of rules, taken from two
different sources, lied and \2ab have been borrowed from a context which men-
tions only five forms of marriages ; cf. (K.) 13. 79. 9 and Dahlmann, Das Ma-
hdbhdrata pp. 203 ff. The same passage, with some variation, but with the same
inconsistency, occurs in Manu (3. 21-26) .

a irangala. My recognition of the unoiriginal dtaracter of the stanza is,
however dearly implied by the fact that I have omitted to give the £269}
stanza a number, differing in this respect con^icuously from the earlier edi-
tions, which treat it as the first stanza of the epic and an integral part of the
text.


The Position oj 3,4

One of the most perplexing forms of variation in the Mahabharata text is
Type No. 4, namdy. Partial Agreement. The critical apparatus is a verit-
able labyrinth of duplicated and intermingled versions, each with a Icaig
and intricate history of its own behind it. We have unfortunately no single
thread to guide us out of the maze, but rather a multitude of strands inter-
twined and entangled and leading along divergent paths. How difficult it
is to find one’s way in this maze may be realized from the fact that so pains-
taking and able a critic as R., despite his close and conscientious study of
the critical apparatus, could totally lose his bearings the moment the network
gets a little more complicated than usual.

The really petidexing part of the whole tangle is that while the agree-
ments of Sj Kj with S are mostly authentic and fundamental, those of
Gi. 2 . 4 . 5 with N are mostly secondary and spurious. Let us first consider
the position of the group 2 . 4 , 5 . which appears to have caused R. most
trouble. I shall state the case as it has been put forward by R. himself
(p. 249 f.).

Supanjadhyaya 19 contains a conversation of Garuda with his father
Kasyapa. Garuda introduces himself as patatam varistha and makes some
polite inquiries regarding his father {kaccid vas tdta kusalam gfhe^u) and his
mother {kaccit. . .mM\d na socati). The father replies that they are doing
well at home {vedaham eM kusalam gjhe^u) and then pronounces a blessing
on Garuda .tv a rak?atu. . .jco yajum^i ; thoi svastyayanam) . This con-
versation assumes in the Mahatriiarata (1. 25. 7-25) the following form.
Garuda asks his father for some new and substantial food and the father re-
commends the mammoth elerrfiant and tortoise (as in Supamja 13. 1 f. Ga-
ruda’s mother does) and proceeds to relate their history. In this scene
the contents of the Supaii). are to be found in the “ interpolated ” verses
(here adapted to the iww contents). In the beginning (324*; Ko. 3.4 N V,
B D Tj), the father asks Garuda if he is doing well “ in respect of food ”*
{kaccid vah kuialam £270} nityam bhojane) ; the three lines of this N in-
terpolation (says R.) correspond to the equally long S interpdation (326*:


1 This is R.’s rendering (“ fragt nach seinem Wohlergehen ‘ in Bezug auf das
Essen’”); but he has evidently misunderstood the line, vrfiich may be translated
thus: “Have you (all) been doing well? (have you had) always plenty of
food?”.

Gi. 2. 4. s)* which Garuda introduces himself as pMatdm srestha. In
both these N and S groups there follows a common interpolation (327*) in
which Garuda says that his mother is well (mdtd me kusald)^ etc. At the
end of the scene follows in these MSS. (N Vj B D Gj. 2. 4. 5 J ^2 4

only partly) the blessings of the father (335* svastyaymam. . ,rco ya-

jumsi),

Garuda has stolen the Amrta ; Indra hurls at him his Vajra ; Garuda
shows his strength and drops just one feather (Mbh. 1. 29. 19 = Supan.i.
27. 6). Mbh. 1. 29. 23 is similar to Supami. 28. 2 (Indra then tries to
    make friends with Garuda); Suparn. 28. 3 is similar to Mbh. 1. 30. 4 ff.
    (Garuda boasts about his great strength) In Suparp. 28. 1 it is narrated
    that out of Garuda’s feather, which had split in three parts {chirmmh tridhd
    tat kuUsena palram), there sprang the peacock, the “two-mouthed serpent-
    lords” and the mongoose. The last three padas of this stanza are interpo
    lated at this place in Ko. 4 (358*); the first finds an echo in 361*, an inter-
    polatbn of Ty Gi.2,4.r, itndhd kyiva tadd vajram), Kn 4 has then further
    actually cited verbatim Suparn. 28. 3 in 365*.

R. adnuts that in the second scene K0.4 unquestionably cite Supani.
F'urther 361*, according to R again, is to be judged similarly. That is an
interpolation in the S MSS., the same stanza of the Suparp. (28. 1) having
hover^ before the eyes of the interpolators as in the case of those who in-
terpolated 358* in Ko .4 After pointing out all this R. asks : “ Should one
now regard the first scene also as an interpolation made independently in N
and S ? Consider that Gj. 2. 4. s agree quite frequently in this episode with
N (1. 20. 15 ; 301* ; 329*; 343*), that they alone have a remarkably large
number of interpolations, and that 340* is found only G^. 2. 4. r> M and cor-
responds to Suparn, 13, 4 Has the G group then £271} interpolated the

passage under the influence of the Supanj. and in its turn influenced the N
groups? Su[kthankar] gives in 1, 20. 1 the diametrically opposite answer
with an assurance which is out of place in such difficult passages. It cannot
even be strictly proved that these “ interpolations in the first scene, which
are common to N and S, are not. m old remnant of the archetype/’

There are in the Adiparvan far more complicated passages than this :
this is one of the simpler complications. I shudder at the thought of what


1 It is by no means certain that (as R. sayaf, p. 249) the stanzas which are
common to the Mbh. and the Suparp. have been borrowed by the Suparp. from the
Mbh. I believe, on the contrary, that the Suparp, has to be looked upon here as
the source from which the stanza in question have been taken over by the epic.
Four of the stanzas are nearly identical' in the two works, because they occur as §Io-
kas in the Suparn, and could be utilized by tlie redactors of tlie epic version with-
out ch^i^e of metre and with some trifling change of language.

and excluded from the text.

R. would have done if he had to handle one of the really difficult cases of
conflation.^ In the present case, it can, as it happens, be stTictly proved
that the doubtful passages of the first scene, which are common to certain N
groups and S groups, are interpolations and no rest of the archetype. Also
I may repeat here most emphatically what I have said in the note on 1. 20. 1
that the irrelevant insertion of 294* in Gj. 2 . 4 . 5 is irrefutable evidence of the
contamination of these four Grantha MSS. from late Northern sources.

We shall consider the second point first. I imagine, R. has misunder-
stood or overlooked the little word “ irrelevantly ” in my note on 1 . 20 . 1 .
Otherwise he would have tried to visualize the passage, by reconstructing it
carefully from the critical notes, and then he would have surely come to the
same conclusion as I . All that is necessary in order to prove that 294’* is
an interpolation in the Grantha group is to cite the passage in extenso. Here
is a transcript of the passage as it is found in G 2 , the better preserved of
the two Grantha MSS. belonging to the Bombay Government collection, col-
lated for the Adiparvan.

Even a cursory reading of the passage will show that lines 7-3 of this
passage (which constitute 294*) are thoroughly irrelevant here. The lines
comprise merely a string of attributes of Garuda. There is no finite verb in

the sentence and there is no reference to Garuda in the foregoing or follow-
ing lines. The only rational explanation of this state of things is that the
lines were interpolated in an ancestor of G^, 2. 4. 5 by a clumsy copyist, who
had missed the right place by four stanzas. Such mistakes occur frequently
in Indian MSS. because the additional lines were, as a rule, first written in
the narrow margin of the MS. and a small mark was made to indicate the
point of insertion. Should the mark get obliterated, the lines would be in-
serted by the next copyist wherever he considered they belonged or fitted
best. If those lines (294*) belonged to the archetype of our MSS. we
should have to assume that they were accidentally mis-placed in a sub-group
of the Grantha version, omitted (for an unknown reason) in another group
of MSSw K1.3 D2 M and are found in their correct place only in

^^0.2.4 Vi B D (except D2). Is this plausible? I can hardly think that R.
would say so. I am inclined to believe that R. had failed to realize how the
passage actually read in this particular sub-group of the Grantha version.
Taking all things into consideration, it is difficult to escape from the con-
clusion that an ancestor of the Grantha sub-group had been compared with
some MS. or MSS. of the Northern recension which contained the spurious
passage 294*. This is the first important fact to remember with regard to
this interesting sub-^roup of the Grantha version. It is quite in harmony
with £273} the other fact that this group contains 25 interpolated passages
in 52 adhyayas (24-75) or about 2()()0 stanzas, which have not been found
so far anywhere else. They are : 320*, 322*, 326*, 330*, 337*, 345*, 351*
(tliird line!), 357*, 363*, 364*, 368*, 371*, 373*, 382*, 386*, 387*, 388*,
406*, 519*, 584*, 636*, 705*, 706*, 741*, 755*. This group moreover con-
tains in the same section the following 10 passages which it shares only with
two or three other MSS. (in some written only on the margin) : 312*, 348*,
353*, 399*, 4104*, 421*, 423*, 442*, 469* (phalasruti !), 831*. How these
passages originate is somewhat of , a mystery. But as no one would be so
inane as to maintain that these are rests of the archetype preserved only in
a sub-group of the Grantha version and lost without a trace elsewhere, not
only in the remaining MSS. of the Grantha version but in all other versions
of both recensions as well, we are inevitably led to the conclusion that this
sub-group of the Grantha version must present a text exceptionally heavily
padded with indiscriminate additions. This noteworthy fact renders its ag-
reements with N immediately suspect. And a priori also it is more likely
that, when there is agreement between a sub-group of one version and some
aatirely different version or versions, the sub-group is the borrower. It may
further be pointed out that 294* is by a long way not the only passage which
this sub-group of the Grantha version shares with the vulgate text, against
the rest of the Grantha version together with the iSarada-Kasmiii and the
Malayalatn versions. Here is a list of these passages (in adhyayas 20-43),
which must all be assumed to be interpolated in the sub-group in question

sion is equally dear and would have been manifest to R., had he but attempt-
ed to visualize the whole passage as it stands in the sub-group instead of
contenting himsdf with merely counting the number of lines. R.’s initial
mistake lies in thinking that 324* and 326* are equivalent passages, whereas
the passages, although of the same length and inserted at the same point,
are utterly different in contents and have an entirely different significance.
The passage 324* {274} contains a kusala-question and an inquiry as to whe-
ther Garuda gets enough to eat ; 326*, on the other hand, contains a question
as to where Garuda is going in such hurry ! Remembering this and reading
the various passages together, the relationship between the MSS. will be
clear. It is again a case of irrelevant insertion in the conflated group. The
passage in question reads in the different MS. groups as under.

Placed in this way, the reader will see at a glance that while 327* is a
proper rejoinder to the query in 324,* it is totally irrelevant after 326*; be-
cause in Gg. 4 . 5 » in reply to Kasyapa's question where Garuda is going, Ga-
ruda says My mother is well, so is my brother, and so am I ” etc. This
clearly shows that in Q 2 4 . 6 » 327* is a secondary interpolation. Then the
question arises whether 326* could be a rest of the archetype. The probabi-
lity of this being so is reduced to nil not merely by the fact that the passage
is found only in the highly inflated group G,. 2 . 4 5 ^ but also from the iK)te-
worthy circumstances (which I fear has escaped the vigilant R/) that in

Gi. 2. 4. 6, has been altered from pr^tm cdhhydtavdn pituh, to Kdsyapam
dlptatejasam in order to accommodate the additional lines. In any case
these interpolations are not common to N and S, as erroneously believed by R.

The history of these interpolations must be something like the following.
The question (which is missing in S except T^) and the answer (which is
found only in Ti Gg. 4. 5 of the S MSS.) regarding Garuda's gastronomic
requirements (324* and 327*) were interpolated in a part of N (namely,
the base of the vul-{275}gate), inspired by SuparQ. 19. 2. Independently
there was inserted in G^ 2. 4. ^ question by Kasyapa (“ Where are you

going with such speed ? ”) in anticipation of the reply of Garuda in 1. 25, 7
cd, an interpolation which probably has nothing to do with the Supanj.
Subsequently, after comparison with some MS. or MSS. of the N recension,
the answer of Garuda 327* (which, as I have remarked above, fits only to the
question in 324* ) was irrelevantly added in an ancestor of Gi 2. 4. 5 by an
ignorant copyist after 326*, where it does not fit in the least ! This second
mistake of the copyist of an ancestor of Gi 2. 4. 5 is another valuable piece of
irrefutable evidence of the contamination of these four G MSS. from some
late Northern source.

I have remarked above that the mangalya or s vasty ayana (335*) before
1. 25, 26 must also be regarded as an interpolation. This follows for one
   thing from the MS. evidence, and is corroborated by the fact that the words
   of the suta : sa tac chrutvd pitur vdkyam refer clearly to Ka^yapa’s directions
   as to what Garuda should next do and ignore the intervening the long man-
   gaJya altogether. That is why the vulgate alters srutvd to smrtvd !

The reader need be not sceptical about the possibilities of such indiscrimi-
nate conflation and addition. The critical apparatus, if closely scrutinized
and properly understood, will reveal numerous instances of a similar charac-
ter. Even a close study of the Kumbhakonam edition, prepared in our own
times by two excellent Southern Pandits, will throw some light on the men-
tality of the old redactors of the Mahabhiarata : parallel and even contradic-
tory versions are placed quite unconcernedly side by side, regardless of the
effect on the reader, regardless of the fact that sentences are left hanging in the
air, that passages do not construe. Here one notices above all the anxiety
that nothing that was by any chance found in a Mahabharata MS. should
be lost. Everything was carefully preserved, assembled in a picturesque dis-
array. The guiding principle was to make the Mahabhiarata a “ thesaurus
of all excellences, ” culled no matter from what source. At the beginning of
his commentary on the Sanatsujatiya,^ Nilakantha naively remarks :

EPIC STUDIES


That is why it is safe to assume that far more stanzas must have been
added to the Great Epic than omitted from it. It follows from this as a co-
rollary that the archetype must almost completely— if not quite completely —
be contained in the extant MSS.^

It will thus be seen that the assurance with which I have spoken (in the
note on 1. 20. 1) of the contamination of Gj. o. 4 . s fi^orn late Northern sour-
ces is amply justified ; and that the passages common to this sub-groip and
the vulgate text (324*, 326*, 327*) mentioned by R. are in fact interpolations
and no remnants of the archetype.

The Position of K.

If I understand R. (v. 248, lines 1-3) right — his remarks are somewhat
confused — ^he questions the propriety of my treating the concordant readings
of the Southern recension and the Kalsmirl (Sarada) version (against the
rest of N) as original readings. But in the course of the same paragraph,
he expresses his unqualified approval of the procedure of Prof. Luders in
accepting as original the ccwisensus of G and B (against the rest of N). Now,
as a matter of documentary probability, there is no difference whatsoever
between the consensus of K and S against B D on the one hand and the
consensus of B and G against D on the other ; because the relationship bet-
ween the different versions must be one of the following type :

Ur-Mahabharata


N S

I _

X

i I 1 r T ^1

(-K) *N 'D -T -G *M

where X is the intermediate archetype of the vulgate, iid *K, *B, etc. are
the (uncontaminated) archetypes of K, B, etc.

£277} If Prof. Luders gives preference to the consensus of B and C
against the D MSS., it is to be presumed that he would likewise give prefer,
ence to the consensus of K and S against B (with or without D) , Let us see
what Prof. Luders himself has to say on the point

“ . . . . Dagegen ist es sehr erfreulich zu horen, dass von Adhy. 26 an noch

stimmen aber die siidlichen Handschriften so genau iiberein wie mit der

von der Kasmln-Version nahezu aus. Es ist daher anzunehmen, dass da, wo

Ka§miri-jVersion Textanderungen enthalten, und der Herausgeber ist meines
Erachtens im Rechte, wenn er gelegentlich der Bangali-Version, mit der die
Maithili- Version und der Text des Arjunalnisra in allgemeinen zusammen-
gehen, da wo sie mit den sudlichen Handschriften iibereinstimmt, den Vorzug
gegeben hat.”

Prof. Luders, in other words, unhesitatingly endorses my procedure.
Herr Dr. R-jben dissents ! I am content to leave it at that.

The Extent of the Virdtaparvan

When I adopted 2050 as the figure^ representing the extent of the Vimta-
parvan, I did not do so, as R. says (p. 251), £278} under the influence of
Utgikar or anybody else. My chief reason for adopting the figure was that
it represents the reading of the majority of K supported by the Maithili
MS. (Vi) and Nilakaiotha version (Dn). When Nilakaiptha adopts it,
there is a certain amount of probability of its being well represented in the
old Northern MSS, of his time. I cannot say whether R. knows that it is the
reading of all printed editions as well ; it looks as though he does not.

Now let us consider the claims of the other variants. S has an obviously
inflated text.'* This inflated text appears to have been recounted in the South
by the diaskeuasts and the Parvasamgraha figure altered accordingly to 3500.'^
So the reading of S may be left out of consideration altogether. The other
Northern variants are as follows :

2015 : q=5I^ 5 K*

2300 • 5Pr ^ Ki Vim B 2 . 3 . 4 m D 7 . u

2500 : ii?sr ^ B 4 Ds

Only one thing that is plain in the midst of the prevailing confusion is
that the text has been counted and the figure adjusted more than once. The
pancadasmva of Kj, however, is obviously only a corruption of poncasod eva
of the text.^ Thus the text reading represents the reading of K except Ko.i.
There is no adequate reason for giving preference here to the readings of Ko
or Kj, because they not only disagree among themselves, but each finds only
desultOTy support from other Northern MSS. What could the editor do under
these circumstances but leave the reading of the vulgate (supported by the
majority of K) in possession and mark it as doubtful? The text figure
appears, however, in a certain measure, to be supported and even made prob-
able by the facts of the case ; because there are in existence, as a matter of
fact, a few MSS. of the textus simplkior (F A M)^— and with the constantly
operating £279"} urge towards inflation their number will be necessarily small
—which are approximately of that length.

The figure 2500, I must confess, I cannot adequately explain.® But as
regards 2300, which approximately represents the extent of the vulgate text
and which is documented by Bj, 3 . « m among others, one may hazard the
guess that it represents the measure of the text of that section of the Bangali
version in which the Kali (or Durga) hymn had been first interpolated along
with some other accretions. All things considered, I think I was perfectly
justified in adopting in the Parvasamgraha the reading which I did adopt.

What R. meaiis^ by saying (p. 251) that the reading of the archetype
night have been :

^N3[RTri5l: ^ I

is beyond my comprehension. Does he mean that I should have set this
(imaginary) line in the constituted text in place of the one which I have,
or does he only want to show that he can compose an Anui^tubh line ? If it
is the latter, I will readily admit that the line is metrically, grammatically
and stylistically impeccable, and does him credit. As we do not, however,
want to rewrite the Mahabharata, such manufa!ctured lines have no value
for us. The only sound test of the correctness of a reading is the evidence

of MSS. In overriding this evidence, R. is unguardedly opening wide the
door to a subjective Hohere Kritik which is the only thing that we must
rigorously avoid doing at this stage of the Mahiabhiarata studies and which
R. would be the first to deprecate if any one else were to attempt it.

Ruben constitutes the Text

At the end of his paper R. has appended, as a specimen, the text of 3
stanzas (1. 26. 1-3), as it should be constituted. The reader who has waded
through 15 pages of R.'s disquisition on the complicacies of the Mahabharata
textual criticism will be amazed to discover that notwithstanding the over-
whelming mass of variants and additional ” lines which stand at the
£280} disposal of the exacting critic and despite the alarming theoretical
doubts and scruples expressed by R. in the earlier part of his paper, his con-
stituted text differs from mine principally in the readings of two ak^aras, and
-the addition of a line which he himself subsequently (p. 256) admits to be
a probable interpolation ! The difference between our readings is as follow's.
In line 1 he hesitatingly sets ""mdtre^ for my °mdtrd, and in line 3 bhonktva
for my bhagndm. R. (doubtfully) decides in favour of °mdtre on the ground
that it is a lectio difficilior and according to R. himself — of course in another
place (p. 253) — the criterion of the lect. diff. is problematic and proves
nothing. Here is a neat little paradox : R. prefers the lect. diff. and sets it
in the text, because the criterion of the lect. diff. is problematic and proves
nothing ! — As regards the second word, R. admits that though he prefers
bhahktvd, the differentiation from (an original) bhagndm to bhmiktvd may
be an innovation (p, 256).

The other difference in the text as constituted by R. and by me lies in
the underlining of the uncertain parts of the text. Let me at once admit that
I have been rather remiss in showing the uncertain portions in this passage.
The device is a practical makeshift and by its very nature hard to apply
strictly and consistently. But the difficulty is not solved by R.’s marking
below the text wavy and straight, single and double lines, in season and out
of season, as soon as he espies a variant in the critical apparatus. An edition
prepared on R’s plan would be indeed not critical but hypercritical. Even
a constituted text is after all a text, meant to be read like any other text,
and not a chart of the aberrations of careless copyists of the last two 'millen-
nia. While it would be foolish to underline bhagndm (line 2) merely on the

1 Even with his reading, R.’s translation is inaccurate. The translation should
be : “ Aber kaum hatte der ubermachtige Garuda (den Baum) mit seinen Fiissen
beriihrtj als der Ast des Baumes abbrach”, etc. and not “ Nachdem (der Baum)
von Garu<Ja beruhrt war, bradi von ihm ein Ast,'" etc. R.’s' translation omits tu,
padbhydm and baliyasd and ignores the force of ""rmtra — (ifc.) ! — With R's reading
matte, the word sd in line 1 (for which there is no variant even in TGM^) re-
mains unclaimed and has to be forcibly connected with sdkhd in the middle of the
following line. Altogether the reading adopted by R. is unsatisfactory.



244


EPIC STUDIES


ground that three (inferior) MSS. read for it lagndm, which is obvi-
ously a clerical error, it is fatuous to underline text-words merely because
some MS. £281} or other has a divergent reading, as R. does in the case of
baRyasd (Ki mahdtmand), sa tad- (G^ sar^ib), tesdm evd"" (iSg te^dm
etc.

With regard to the short explanatory notes (p. 255 f.) added by R.
below the specimen of the text, I have to make the following comments.

The participle smayamdna is not “episch”, but smaym (of the text)
may be, since the root swi is commonly used with middle endings. — The line
340* being an interpolation (even R. admits, p. 256, the possibility of its
being that), the adhamukhdn of the text is opposed virtually only by the
Qvdhmukhdn of the two Grantha MSS. G 3 . g, because the remaining adverse
MSS, (Gj. 2 . 4 2 M), while trying to interpolate the Vaikhana^s (under the
influence of Suparn. 13.4), have obviously altered the last foot of the line
{2d) therefore the text reading adhomukhdn is hundred per cent, certain
and in need of no underlining, straight or wavy, — In view of the fact that
340* is missing even in T 0^,^ and in regard to the general character of
Gi. a. 4 . 5 explained above, there cannot be the slightest doubt about the spuri-
ousness of 340 * ; the line was probably first inserted in M and copied thence
by the highly inflated group Gi. 2 - 4 * 5 .— -The form jagjhe is found only in
five Devanagari and two Southern MSS. (one Malayalam arid one Grantha).
In old Devanagari MSS. (written with pr^tbamatras), jagfJte would be all
but indistinguishable from jagrdha of the text. So the reading of these Deva-
nagari MSS. may be ignored in this case. The Bangali and the Southern
MSS., which would carefully distinguish between the two words, have jag-
7dha, with two insignificant exceptions in the Southern recension. It is on
that account that jagrdha was adopted in the text, and it is not doubtful.—
2ef is certainly a third line, but is in spite of that quite certain. The line is
not missing in any MS., and as for its reading there is agreement on all
material points between all versions of both recensions. Thus K and S agree
completely with each other as far as e is concerned, which is a very signi-
ficant fact in its favour and should not be lightly ignored. The variations
concern mainly /. The difficult prmisdtayai, a led. diff., preserved only in
K, was the cause of the remodelling of the pada in S and the vulgate. Of
£282} course all guesses as to how the variants have actually arisen must be
more or less problematic. I would, however, hazard the conjecture that tlie
way to the variant pravicdlaym was virtually paved by the southern tend-
ency to confuse the palatal siWlant (5) and fricative (c) : the successive
steps in the corruption would be pravi^dtayan, corrupted to *°cdtayani and


^ G 1 2 4 2 have used their adhomukhdn. in 340*. They therefore substitute
tapodhandn in its place in the original line. M has worked out another combinB'-
tion ( tapodhmdneovdhrmkhdn ) .

then corrected ” to * °calaym. The vinasaym of Kg Dg is perhaps an ori-
ginal gloss ; or (more probably) a wrong correction of an original mislec-
tion, the successive steps being visatayan, *visdnayan {ta and na being writ-
ten almost alike in old Devanagari MSS), and vimsuym. The difficulty
with the word pmvisdtdyan may be realized when it is remembered that the
Dhatupatha knows no root like sat or sdt ; it cites only sad !

* * ♦

Ruben's long disquisition on the difficulties of the Mahabharata textual
criticism boils down to this : only that portion of the text which is docu-
mented by both recensions, in identical terms, is tolerably certain ; the rest
is doubtful in varying degrees, there being no criterion whatsoever which can
enable us to discriminate with complete confidence between the variants ;
even the concordance between K and S (against B D)i is not conclusive evi-
dence of the originality of the common reading. This is a more or less ob-
vious standpoint, though partly erroneous and distinctly timid and conser-
vative. It was hardly necessary for the “ Referent ” to write so much in order
to say so little. His attitude of dogmatic doubt has caused him to make
unwittingly some wild exaggerations and unwarranted generalizations as I
have shown above. His perfunctory study of the manuscript evidence has led
him occasionally to make gross blunders in the estimation of the relationship
of the different manuscript groups and versions, some of which have been
pointed out above. Many of the difficulties of the Mahabharata textual cri-
ticism of which he speaks in his paper are £283} due to his failure to under-
stand the modus opermdi of the redactors and copyists of the epic and his
lack of insight into the character of the different manuscripts--an insight
which can be acquired only after a long familiarity with the manuscripts
themselves and a close arid patient study of their tendencies and idiosyn-
cracies. Ruben's paper is, in general, quite intelligent, but not at all im-
portant for the Mahabharata textual criticism.

## More Text-Critical Notes

The Mahabharata Textual Criticism is unquestionably making progress ;
slow but steady progress. There are many things in it still that are
obscure, but some things have undoubtedly been cleared up. Thus there
seems to be consensus of opinion among scholars now on the following points.

1 R. seems to have stomehow a lurking partiality for the consensus of B and
S (or even B and G). If he only knew, the agreements between K and S are likely
to prove mudi sounder than those between B and S ; for, while there are indica-
tions that there may be sporadic contamination between B and G (and perhaps
evOT between B and S), the (genuine) Kaiimiri version (;§) and S as a whole have
certainly the appearance of being almost wholly independent of each other through-
out the Adiparvan.

EPIC STUDIES


m


The Mahabharata textual tradition, as we know it, is far from being
quite uniform. There are now two main streams of tradition, the Northern
Recension and the Southern Recension. Each recension is further sub-divided
into a number of provincial versions, which differ inter se in many parti-
culars. But the text of the Mahabharata must have been in a fluid state for
a very long time, almost from the beginning. Clearly therefore a wholly
satisfactory restoration of the text to its pristine form — even the late so-called
satnsahml samhitd /orm — ^would be a task now beyond the powers of criti-
cism. All that we can attempt now is to reconstruct the oldest form of the
text that is possible to reach on the basis of the MS. material available. The
peculiar conditions of the transmission of the epic necessitate an eclectic but
cautious utilization of all MS. classes. The Kasmiri version {textus simpli-
dor) has proved itself so far to be unquestionably the best Northern version ;
and the Malayalam, which in many respects is superior to the Grantha, is
likewise the best Southern version (textus arnatior). The agreement between
the KasmirT version and the Southern recension (or sometimes even merely
the Malayalam version) can be taken as an indication of originality. But
contamination between the different versions was inevitable and must be
admitted. The Telugu MSS. are generally and the Grantha MSS. frequently
contaminated from Northern sources. Even the Malayalam version, which
is on the whole free from Northern influence, may show some contamination,
in unexpected places. {91} In fact, all versions, with the possible exception
of the Ka^mirf, are contaminated in various degrees. It is, therefore, often a
very ticklish question to decide which agreements are original and which
secondary. Notwithstanding these difficulties, experience has now shown, the
case is not as desperate as it might at first appear. For one thing, there is
a considerable bulk of text where the Northern and Southern versions are in
full agreement, where there are no variants at all, or — ^more frequently — only
unimportant variants : this part of the text is fortunately certain. There is
then the question of the “additional*' passages, that is, passages found in
only one of the rival recensions. There is only one rational way of dealing
with these “ additional “ passages : they must be carefully segr^ted from
the rest of the text, and examined individually. The onus of proving the ori-
ginality of these “ additional “ passages will naturally rest on him who
allies the ori^nality : the documents speak naturally against them, but their
evidence is not by any means conclusive.

These are some of the principal findings of the Prol^omena. It is assur-
ing to find tfet these conclusions have been restated and endorsed emphati-
cally by so cautious and judicious a critic as Prof. M. Winternitz in his
recent review of the Adiparvan volume, in the pages of these Anmls (Vol. 15,
pp. 159-175). The outlines of the reconstruction may, therefore, be taken
to be correct, and the method of reconstruction sound. There is bound to be
difference of opinion as regards details, When there are hundreds of thou?>-

cmds of readings to be considered and weighed, it is natural that all the selec-
tions would not satisfy all readers ; and there are bound to be small slips in
so enormous and difficult a work as this. But the reader has the advantage
of having the full critical apparatus before him, prepared with all possible
care and presented in a convenient manner. The reader may easily substi-
tute in the text any reading that appeals to him better. Prof. Winternitz
has thus shown hisi preferences, in the article mentioned above, in a certain
number of cases, where he differs from me as regards the choice of readings.
They are passages, as he tells us, which he came across in reading parts of
the Critical Edition with his pupils in the Indologisches Seminar at Prag.
Me has thus published these criticisms after much thought and discussion
with {92} other scholars. I gladly take this opportunity, therefore, to present
my view of the case, setting forth the reasons which have guided me in the
choice of the readings adopted by me in the Critical Text.

1. 3. 60 ; gird vd sarhsdmi.

I have indeed assumed that agreement between K (strictly speaking,
between the original Kasmiri version, or at least the isarada MS. SJ and S
is a sufficier.t though not a neecssary proof of originality. But there is no
agreement here between K and S. Kq, it is true, represents the version K in
a comparatively pure form (Prolegomena, -p. L.); but K© is not K ; and Kj
is, on the whole, decidedly a better representative of the Kasmiri version
than Ko (Prolegomena, p. xlix). Now here Kq and have different
readings ; Ko agrees with S, and Ki with the rest of N ! This fact has been
ignored by Winternitz. As for the agreement of Ni and S, I have pointed
out in the Prolegomena (p. lix), that '‘even the manuscripts of distant
Nepal are not wholly free from contamination from some Southern source or
sources (direct or indirect).’’ Thus the agreement between and S cannot
be considered as compelling evidence, by any means. Moreover, it should
be borne in mind that this agreement between Kq and S concerns merely
the omission of one syllable ; and it is clear that this trifling omission could
quite easily take place utterly independently in the respective group)s. There-
fore, even the documental probability in favour of the reading preferred by
Winternitz is not at all strong. It is, in fact, considerably weakened by
the following (intrinsic) consideration. N has vd and a dodeka (hypermc-
tric) line ; S omits vd and has the eleven-syllable (normal) line. This is a
circumstance suspicious in itself. It is by no means certain or necessary that
all the padas of our Tri^tubhs should be of the eleven-syllable pattern. Some
of these hypermetric padas can indeed be made normal by the omission of
one or nK»*e of the additional syllabks, often n^rely of an expletive. But
there are many lines which defy such athetiratiem ; for instance, the second
pada of the very next stanza (1. 3. 61 ; ndsatyadasrm sunasau vknjaymttau) ,
Such lines ought to {93} warn us against giving hasty preference to these nor-
malizing readings. I have cited elsewhere (Prolegomena, p. xciii) clear



EPIC STUDIES

instances of efforts made by redactors to correct hypermetric padas of Slokas.
Similar efforts are to be found among the variants of our Tristubhs. But as
the scheme of the Tristubh is more variable and arbitrary, or at least more
complicated and obscure, it is difficult to prove the alterations made by the
different scribes or editors. In this particular instance, however, it seems to
me, there is no reason to assume that the original pada was not hypermetric,
because our pada is a standard hypermeter — a type of which Hopkins has
cited numerous instances. Cf. No. 6 of the typical, oft-recurring varieties
(mentioned by Hopkins in The Great Epic, p. 275) :

Are we to omit the bracketed syllables — or some similar syllable — in
each case, on the ground that they disturb the metre, if not the sense ? We
do not possess yet the collations of all these passages, but I am confident
that there will always be some MSS. if not versions (or even a whole recen-
sion), which omit these extra syllables, for one reason or other. There is
this other consideration. The ancients had as good an ear for the rhythm
of their Tri§tubhs as we have, if not better. Why and how was the offend-
ing syllable first inserted, and then tolerated by generations of editors? All
N MSS. except contain the hypermeter. Is it not, under these circums-
tances, more probable that the original was a hypermetric line, which was
emended by some redactors in conformity with the later ideas of the regular
Upajati metres? {94} This particular hypermeter is moreover antique, for
we find (as Hopkins has pointed out) already an example of it in Maud*
Up. 3. 1. 6 :

yatra {tat) satyasya paramam nidhdnam,

with the scansion - — , which differs from our

line as regards the quantity of the first two syllables only ; ours has an
iambic opening, the Mupdaka line trochaic. Here, also, we can with im-
punity omit the bracketed syll 2 d)le (tot), and get a line which is metricaily
a “ better line, but obviously not the original one. I am, therefore, fully
persuaded that in all such cases we have original hypermeters. These old



£PlC STUDIES IV


249


stanzas were not built at all on the pattern of the later, more regular, classi-
cal metres, but followed some other finer rhythmic principle, which escapes
our methods of rough analysis by syllable-counting. — Now as regards the
sense. The exact explanation of the phrase gird vd samsdmi is, I admit, difficult.
Nilakaptba offers the facile explanation : vdMhdas cdrthe (i.e. vd = ca),
which can hardly be considered satisfactory. Devabodha analyses the phrase
into gkdV’\-d=sdmsdmi (with girau, loc. of gm), but that hangs together
with his interpretation of the Asvins as the Sun and the Moon, which is not
very convincing. It is possible to interpret the words as ‘ gird vd ’ samsdmi
(i.e. vai-\r dsamsdmi) , as is done by some editors. On the other hand, it is
also possible to emend vd to vmi (“ ye two, ” acc. dual), which would give
a satisfactory sense. This reading, which is mentioned as a patha by Arju-
namisra, is found in only one of our inferior MSS. (Dg). It seemed to me
such an obvious emendation that I did not like to adopt it on such slender
MS. evidence, and I have hesitatingly (as shown by the wavy line) set in
the text the old Northern reading vd, which isi unquestionably a lectio diffi-
cilior. The whole hymn is, however, obscure and full of interpretative and
other difficulties. It will have to be studied and dealt with more minutely
before we can be sure of its text and meaning. But I am fully persuaded
that vd (or some such word) did form part of the original line, and it would
be a mistake to omit it.

1. 3. 145 Kuruksetre nivasatdm.

Why WiNTERNiTZ should have any doubts about nivasatdm, I fail to
understand. It is merely an augmentless imperfect, and {95} augumentless
imperfects are most common in the Mbh., especially in the case of verbs with
prepositions, as in this case. Even Whitney {Sanskrit Grammar, §587d)
remarks : “ Besides the augmentless aorist-forms with md prohibitive, there
are also found occasionally in the later language augmentless imperfect-
forms (very rarely aorist-forms), which have the same value as if they were
augumented, and are for the most part examples of metrical license. They
are especially frequent in the epics^ (whence some scores of them are quot-
able).” To this, in 1884 (that is now more than fifty years ago), Holtz-
MANN added the note :

” Beispiele von fehlendem Augmente des Imperfects sind ziemlich hau-
fig, besonders in Q>mpositum und hier wieder in solchen, die mit auf a aus-

(no. V. 1. !) 189. 21, samahhidravat 218. 28. There are many others, less
certain. A number of instances will be found in the Tentative Edition of
the Virataparvan by Mr. Utgikar ; the Critical Edition of this parvan, I
may add, will again contain quite a few instances of this particular solecism.
How many examples are really needed before it is admitted that augument-
less imperfect forms occur regularly in the Mbh., and we cease to talk of
“correct” and “incorrect” forms? The augmentless forms are quite
as “ correct ” as the other as far as the Mbh. is concerned.
WiNTERNiTZ points out that the “correct” form “is given by the Kasmi-
rian transcript by the Maithili and Bengali MSS., by Arjunamisra, and
by some Southern MSS., ” and therefore he prefers it. It is a wonder that
£96} it is not given by more MSS. ; because the tendency is always to change
an “ incorrect ” form into the “ correct ” one. We have here to lode not to the
MSS. which have the ” correct ” form, but to those which have not the “ cor-
rect ” form ! Let us look at it in another way. If nivasatdm be the original
reading, then there are two ways of improving the text : (i) keep vasatdm
of the original and change the .word to nyavasatdm and thus make it “ cor-
rect” (Central sub-recension and Malayalam, independently), or (ii) keep
ni- intact, and change the word to the present nivasatab (“ K” version) ;
both are represented here. If, on the other hand, nyavasatdm were the origi-
nal reading, no one would think of changing it later to nivasatdm ; and
nivasatah of K would also be quite unintelligible. The text reading niva-
satdm thus explains, to a certain extent, how the other readings may have
arisen and has therefore been preferred. And I think there cannot be much
doubt about its correctness and originality.

1 . 3. 183 prabruhi vd kim kriyatdm dvijendra.

If WiNTERNiTZ prefers me kvm, he must, at the satne time, also prefer
karardyam adya | yendsi kdryeii^i etc., found in N (except K D2.5) ; but
he did not realize it.’ The me kim of the Vulgate cannot be joined to kriya-
tarn dvijendra of K B4 D2.5 S. There is no MS. which reads prabruhi me
kim kriyatdm dvijendra | susrusur asmy adya vacas tvadiyam. The reading
of the line proposed by Winternitz will be like an animal with the head
of a horse and tail of a donkey ! The text reading of the entire line — nay, of
the entire stanza — occurs verbatim in Kj. 3. 4 I think, the original NoKrthem
reading was probably prabruhi vd kim, as in text. If vd be useless after pra^
bruhiy it is more than useless after kim, where Winternitz would have it.
It is conceivable that the (original) Northern reading (preserved in Kj. 3. 4.
is corrupt, and we ought to give here preference to S. That is another mat-
ter. Not being convinced that vd kim of 3. 4 was “ secondary ” or cor-



EPIC STUDIES IV

rupt from hint vd of S, I have adopted, in the text, vd kirn underlining it to
show that it is less than certain. But mdm kirn, mdm yat, me kim, me tv am,
vokyam of the Northern MSS. are clearly all secondary, and need not be
considered at all.

{97} 1. 55. 3 stptum pdtram ca rdjams tvmn.

I have taken the Sarada MS. only as the norm for my edition ; I have
not undertaken to reproduce its text verbatim. The srotfpdtrarh ca rdjams
tvdm of §1 K is opposed by all other MSS. And, moreover, as there is agree-
ment between B D and S — more or less independent versions — on the reading
srotum pdtram ca rdjams tvam, this reading is indicated as the original, and
has been adopted, without wavy line ; a procedure quite in accord with the
principles of text reconstruction laid down in the Prolegomena (p. XCI).
WiNTERNiTZ finds srotrpdtram ca rdjams tvdm of K “better Sanskrit,” but
I must frankly confess that I could not make head or tail of it, and I can-
not understand it even now. The text reading is the same as the reading of
the Vulgate and of the Southern recension, and is besides quite clear, and,
as far as I can judge, flawless Sanskrit. It may be translated : “ And thou
art, O King; a fit person to hear (Vyasa's Bharati Katha),” a sense which
suits the context admirably. Furthermore, K has here an entirely different
reading for the whole stanza. If we adopt the reading preferred by Winter-
NITZ, then we must read the stanza as :

srotrpdtram ca rdjmhs tvdm prdpyeyarh Bhdratl subhd ]
guror vaktraparispandani mudd protsdhativa nwm\\,

which is apreciably different from the text. But the variants of the other ver-
sions do not at all suggest that this is the original reading. Our text: repre-
sents the reading of the Southern recension, which has here, in my opinion,
the greatest probability.

1. 56, 8 : katham vyatikramm dyute.

It is natural that W. should demand wavy lines for this verse. I admit
the line is most puzzling, and I only lighted upon the solution of the puzzle
by accident, after prolonged wrestling with it. An explanatory note was really
called foi-, because the first line is absolutely unintelligible unless one knows
the particular meaning of the root vyatikram intended here, which is “to
wrongly submit or surrender oneself to, wrongly take to (a thing or person,
acc.)”. It is a rare meaning, but not unknown. It is given in the dictionaries
of Monier Williams (ed. 1899, s. v. {98} vyatikram), and Macdonell
(s. v. kram). It appears not to be given in PW, but pw has (s. v. krOm) :
“verkehrter Weise sich einer Sache (Acc.) hingeben”. One example of the
use is (B.) 12. 174. 36 :

atha ye buddhim aprdptd vyatikrdntds ca mudhatdm
te 'tivelam prakr^ymti samtdpam upaydnH ca | \



252


EPBC STUDIES


Here vyatikrMM ca muihatam must mean those who have surrender-
ed themselves (wrongly) to folly” ; no other meaning will fit, as far as I
ctin judge. Our stanza is, therefore, to be traslated thus :

How (indeed) did the two sons of 'Prtha, as well as the two som of
Madri, (tamely) surrender themselves to the tiger among men (Yudhi§-
thira), who was being cheated at dice by those wicked men, and (how did
they) follow him?”

This strange submission consists in their consenting, in the first instance,
to be used as pledges or stakes in that dire game of dice, and acquiescing
dumbly to everything that Yudhi^thira did. The Southern recension is un-
animous on the point that the doubtful word was some form of vyMikmm ;
and the eight readings recorded in our crit. app. show that it must have been
some word which was as unintelligible to the scribes and editors as it is to
WiNTERNiTZ. WiNTERNiTz is again mistaken in thinking that the S reading
is vyatikmmadyute. This is the reading not of S but of only two MSS.
(Gs.e) out of the thirteen Southern MSS. of our crit. app. I myself have
followed S in reading vyatikramm dyiite, which is the reading of five of the
Southern MSS. In fact, my text represents the reading of the majority of
the Southern MSS., and is, therefore in a sense, the true S reading. It is
needless to add that vimrjitcm of ‘‘ K ” and vyasaninam of the Central sub-
recension, are emendations, made by those who could not make head or tail
of the original. For it is clear that no one would change vinirjitam or vya-
sofdnam to any of the Southern readings, while the reverse would be the most
natural thing in the* world. It is further worthy of note that while the
Northern MSS. have the easier reading, there is no agreement between the
Kasimri and the Central sub-recension. They must therefore represent in-
dependent alterations of a third original. — Following certain other S MSS.
P. P. S. Sastri has adopted the reading {99} vyatikramam dyute (without
recording any v. 1.) ; but I am inclined to think that this is a wrong analysis
of ""krammdyute whidi in S MSS. stands for both ^krammh dyute and
°kramm dyute— Now that I have explained how the awkward word is to
be interpreted, I have no doubt that Winternitz will agree with me that the
text reading is correct

1. 57. 20 : kriyate *U€€hrayo njpaih.

There has been extraordinary reluctance among scholars to face the fact
that the Mbh. text once contained far more examples of hiatus than what one
deems right or readable for such an ancient and venerable text. But there
is hardly any excuse now for such hesitation. On p. xciii of the Prolegomena,
I have given numerous instances of the surreptitious efforts of scribes and
redactors to eliminate hiatus, which show that hiatus was an anathema to
them. It is wdl known that the Sandhi is not rigidly observed in the Vedic
Sajhhitas, the Brahmaoas, and the Upani^ads, in Pali, and in Prakrit works.



EPIC STUDIES IV


253


Why must the Sandhi then be rigidly observed in the popular epic, a work
which has its roots firmly embedded in the soil of the heroic poetry of the
Sutas, and which has throughout preserved vestiges of its humble origin ? The
only reference (so far as I know), in the poem itself, to the Mbh. being a
Kavya {krtam mamedam bhagavan kdvyam paramapujitam) has now dis-
appeared with the Brahma-Ganesa inteipolation in the Adi, and we are thus
left only with a Purana, Itihasa or Akhyi^a. A specimen of this class of
work may surely contain sporadic instances of hiatus, without our being
scandalized. It is futile, I may add, to try to apply to this category of popu~
Utr literature the rules of the dialect of the high-brow iSistas. We may expect
every conceivable solecism in the language of the Mbh., and we find, in fact,
an amazing variety of them ; the hiatus, which was extremely common, is
only one of such so-called irregularities. But for this strange modem anti-
pathy towards hiatus, Winternitz would have recognized that the emenda-
tion is quite legitimate and certain. Winternitz considers the North-
ern readings but wholly ignores the Southern, which is fatal to his
argument. S does not contain either ati (or abhi) which is found only in
certain N MSS., and is besides superfluous. {100} TG have recast the line ;
kuTvanty etc dhvafocchrayam, with kurvmti (note the active voice!), that
is, a form of the root kr (like kriyate of N) at the head of the pada. All
these versions have the verb, it may be noted, in the beginning of the pada.
M contains the same three words as our kriyate, ucchr^yali and njpm}}, but
transposes kriyate and ucchrayalt, reading ucchrayah kriyate nrpaih. This is
the key-.reading, which gives a clue to the original. You can explain every-
thing else, but you cannot explain the transposition in M {which fiormdly
ought agree with TG), unless you start from the hypothetical kriyate
*ucchrayo njpaih. If you argue, on the other hand, that the reading of M
is an arbitrary variant, which is in no need of a special explanation by means
of an emendation, then there is no need of a critical edition either ; because
all MSS. contain approximately the same text and the same story, and the
few differences could be regarded as arbitrary variations which needed no
explanation. With this reading, containing the opprobious hiatus, you can
explain all the variations. N inserts a futile and innocuous abhi (corrupted
in some MSS. to ati) to destroy the hiatus. M transposes the ucckrayo^ which
is the chief cause of the trouble ; TG recast the original, and substitute a
reading which fits badly in the context, with ah active kmvanti (having no
proper subject), after kriyaie in stanza 19. That is how I r^atd this little
complex of readings, and hence the emendation, of whose correctness I myself
have no doubt whatsoever.

1. 57. 21 : hdsyarupef^a samhmah*

This reading is undoubtedly, as Winternitz rightly observes, the lectio
difficitior, but there is not the slightest doubt about its being the original
reading, judging by documentary evidence, and therefore, there is absolutely

EPIC STUDIES


no nedd of underlining it. It is, in the first instance, the reading of the whole
oj M, which WiNTERNiTZ appears not to have realized. I have stated, as my
opinion, that the Malaytalam version is the best representative of the Southern
recension (Prolegomena, p. lxxiii). I am glad to note that Winternitz
{Annals, Vol. 15, p. 170) agrees with me, and that even my learned friend
Vidyasagara Prof. P. P. S. Sastri now endorses it. In the introduction
(p. iii) to Vol. IV of his edition £ 101 } of the Southern Recension, Sastri
writes : “ Not having been subject to Nayak influence in any manner what^
soever, the tradition handed down By the Malayialam Manuscripts preserved
the Grantha text, in a purer and more unmixed form than even some com-
paratively early Grantha manuscripts, as the Malayalam MSS. do not at
all seem to have come into contact with the Northern Recension till ‘very
recent timesj'^ Now this reading of the Malayalam version is supported by
the reading of the Kasmiri version ; for though is missing, yet (India
Office 2137) has the corrupt hdmyahdmya'' (for hamsa° of the rest of N),
and it is well known that in Niagari copies of ;Saradia MSS., s is frequently
transcribed wrongly as m ; so that we have to read hdsyahdsya (dittography).
The reading is further home out by Devabodha s gloss (the MS. reads hdsa^
for our hdsya^) : hdsariipena kridavatararuperia (cf. p. 9910 of the Crit
Ed. for the gloss) , where hamsa, in any case, would not fit, for it is not clear
how hamsarupa would be krlidvcddrarupa. Further, samkarah is the read-
ing of all MSS. except B 5 Dn, which have Isvarah (an obvious emendation)
and TG which has vdsavaJi (which must likewise be an emendation), origi-
nally, perhaps, only a gloss. Here practically the whole of N is supported
by M. samkarah is here not a name of Indra, but only an epithet, an attri-
bute meaning ‘auspicious, beneficent'. Thus in (B.) 3. 229. 6 samkara is
used with reference to Skanda : lokdndm samkaro bhava. In (B) 3. 201. 29
the epithet mahesvara (“great lord'’) is applied to Vi§nu tvayi .nit-
yam mahesvara. Further in 1 . 58. 43, the epithet isa (“lord”) and
sambhu (“auspicious”) are applied to god Brahma : prabhavah sarvabhu-
tdndm tsah sathbhuh prajdpatih. This shows that the words samkara, sambhu,
Isa, mdhesvara, and so on, which are now generally regarded as proper names
of Mahadeva, were still not specialized, but were applied to other gods as
well, as mere epithets, descriptive of their beneficence or omnipotence.

Here it is not difficult to see on what authority the adopted reading
rests. Tlie footnotes give here the reading of N V^ B D £ 102 } (except D 5 )
of the Northern, and of G of the Southern recension. The adopted reading

of the remaining MSS. K D 5 T M (since 6 , is missing, as mentioned on

p. XXIV of the Prolegomena). The Vulgate lacks here the support of the
Grantha version, which has an enitrely different reading :

avayos ca katham brahman bhavisyati samdganuth |

The Grantha version dispenses altogether with the troublesome drsyatoh
of the original (or the unsuitable v. 1. drUayoh of the Vulgate), thus reveal-
ing its secondary character. The line was recast in the archetype “ Sigma
(see the pedigree in the Prolegomena, p. xxx). The textual relations here
are ideal, being clear as crystal. Winternitz is right in regarding it as pass,
part, praes. with active ending. Passive forms with active endings are quite
common in the epic. I adduce a few examples to dispel the remaining doubts
of sceptics : 1. 11. 15 isyati (v. 1. Uyeta, arhati etc.) ; 16. 15 dksipyatajj, (no.
v. 1. explanation); 34. 13 moksyanti (v. 1. moksyante)\ 47. 9 sambhriyantu

219, 5 adrsyan (v. 1. adrsyd, nyapatan).

1. 92. 2 : Gahgd srir iva rilpim.

The configuration of the MSS. as well as the intrinsic merit of the read-
ings are different in the two lines. That is how iSj appear to be of greater
authority in the first line than in the second. The salildt of the text is found
in all MSS. except (S only transposing the word : Text salildt tasmdt,

S Gangd salildt), and is, therefore, for one thing, obviously far better docu-
mented than sayandt of Ki only. In the second line, therefore, we have,
practically, only two readings : sayandt of Si Ki, against salildt of the rest ;
therefore the reading of has been rightly re-[103}-jected. Such is not

the case in the first line. Here we have three nearly independent readings
(§1 Ki Gahgd mr iva rupini : Vulgate G. strlrupadhdrim : S lobhamyata-
mdkrtih, which latter is mr jourth pdda). Here, while the two Northern
readings are somewhat allied to each other, the Southern reading is entirely
different, having very little connection with the Northern. None of the
readings can be mechanically derived from the other, and intrinsically they
are all more or less of the same value. Such being the case, the Northern
tradition was, as usual, followed. Winternitz does not say why he thinks
strirupadhdrm is better than the other. The reason why I chose stir iva
rupini {** beautiful like Lak§mi '') is that it is nearer in sense to lobhamyata-
mdkjtih (‘'with a most enticing form'*) of S, than stfirupadhdrmi (“assum-
ing the form of a woman”) of the Vulgate. I have here explained in detail
the exact reasons which have weighed with me in making the difficult choice,
but as a matter of fact, they are all three epic iterata and these iterata

keep alternating with each other indiscriminately. In such cases, it is im-
possible to decide, with certainty, which is original and which is secondary,
and the matter is also of no great consequence. The uncertainty of the
text tradition has been duly indicated by a wavy line.

1 . 92. 7 : rdjan kmydm varastnyam.

I am glad Winternitz has drawn my attention to a wrong reading
which has crept in here, through oversight, and I gladly take this opportun-
ity to publish a correction. The reading I had intended to adopt, or at
least I should have adopted, is precisely the one advocated by Winternitz :
rdjm kamydfh vara°, that of the Kasmiri version (iSi Ko-2.4). The fact is
that just for first two words of the last pada of this stanza, there is a con-
fusing array of readings in Northern MSS., all meaning, more or less, the
same thing : rdjan kdmyam Ko-2.4), divydm (K3), divydm kmydm
(Vulgate), kdmydm divydm (B), divydm kdmydm Under these

circumstances, clearly, the Kasmin reading should have been adopted, ac-
cording to the principles enunciated in the Prolegomena, but through a
clerical error kmydm (of the Vulgate) £104} has crept in, in place of
kdmydm (of the Kasmiri), which was intended. — I do not agree with
Winternitz however when he says that the epithet kmyd is “not very
appropriate for Gah^ It would be quite appropriate, as far as I can see.
It would imply that she was an unmarried virgin, which is the regular
meaning of kmyd ; compare :

1. 57. 63 uvdc /2 matpriyam krtvd kmyaiva tvam bhavisyasi

1. 104. 12 prdddc ca tasydh kmydtvam punch sa paramadyutih

(B) 3. 307. 16 sd mayd sake samgamya punch kmyd bhavisyasi

It would then answer Pratipa’s objection (1. 92. 6) :

ndham parastriycm kdmdt gaccheyam varavarnini.

But kanydm is not supported by the MS. evidence, and kdmydm is :
that is the main point. The constituted text should therefore be corrected
accordingly by changing kmydm to kdmydm.

1 . 92. 45 : na ca torn kimccmvdcc.

Here I do not agree with Winternitz. I am fully persuaded that the
text is quite in order. The first mistake Winternitz makes is in thinking
that sa is the reading of K ; it is actually given in the crit. app. as the
reading of 61 Ko.3.4 D5. Winternitz has overlooked the fact that §1
differs from Kj, which is in itself suspicious ; and K^ is also excluded from
the group. If ca has to be translated by “ but there is no help for it ; for
ca has frequently to be rendered in that way. For the Mbh., I may add,
ca and tu are almost synonymous, tu having entirely lost the specific ad-
versative force. It is quite clear that there must have been a period in the
history of Sanskrit, as it was spoken, in which the two ^all particles ca



EPIC STUDIES IV


257


and tu were confused in the mouths of the common people, and were used
indiscriminately. That is, in fact, the only explanation of the curious particle
cu one conies across in certain A^ka inscriptions, which is evidently a com-
bination of ca and tu. The iSarada MS. undoubtedly offers a “better"’
reading, but, as a comparison of the different versions shows, it is a clear
innovation or emendation. That the original had something like na ca (of
the text) is proved by TG, which has nu tUy only in a slightly different
combination : {105} ma^ia kimcin na tu tdm. M differs from TG, and
has a third combination, with a new word vacanam, not found in the other
versions : novae a vacanam kimeit, which has neither na ca nor na tUy and
which does not help to solve our difficulty. The sa of some of the Kasmiri
MSS. is not necessary for the context, as the subject mahipatih (“ the king ”)
occurs in the same line.

1. 92. 50 : a^teme Vasavo dev ah.

Practically all the MSS. except those of the D version begin with a^tau,
which makes it probable (if it does not directly prove) that the original
must have begun with astau ; therefore imesiau (one of the readings pre-
ferred by WiNTERNiTZ) must be ruled out, as an emendation, probably of
a lectio difficilior. The (final) me of and the initial ime of some

Nagari MSS. suggest that the original was the conjectural * asteme, which
combines the characteristics of these groups, and which is very close to the
a^td of 5^2. It is also suggested, to a certain extent, by the Bengali
fl.s/CM ye. The conjectural astemCy is in fact,, tlie hypothetical form to
which the various readings astau me, asta me, astau ye, astau hi, and imestau
seem to converge. The convergence is not a matter of which a mathematical
proof can be supplied. If Winternitz does not see the convergence, he
may substitute for the text reading any of the five readings found in the
MSS. I did not know which to choose ; hence the emendation. The change
is not quite unmotivated. The motive appears to have been the seemingly
irregular Sandhi (double crasis) : astau 4 - ime = a^td + ime = asteme.
But as a matter of fact, there need not have been any irregularity at all in
the Sandhi, for asfeme may simply be resolved into (^(d-\-ime, or asta+ime,
since besides the heavier a^tmi, both the forms and asta were in use,
of which the latter (a^(a) particularly was used, I think, in all periods of
the language (cf. Whitney, Sanskrit Grammar § 483). The translation of
Winternitz is not quite accurate ; at least it is not literal. The stanza
has no word for “obtained birth,” which Winternitz interpolates into it,
in order to justify the reading me, of me,” which he has further to explain
as “ in my body ”. Translate : “ Those gods, the Eight Vasus, had on

account of Vasi§tha’s curse become men (lit. attained the state of men).”

for the original reading ; it is purely the result of conflation. is, more-
over, not a version ; it is merely a single MS., written in Maithili script,
and as such, capable of showing any reading at random. Again, the agree-
ment of with Dn and S against B Da is most unnatural and thoroughly
suspicious. In other words, the MS. evidence here is extremely confused.
Ordinarily I would have adopted the K reading tnmiusaivam updgatah,
which has occurred already in the previous adhy. (1. 92. 50), and occurs
again in (B) 3. 83. 66 ; but owing to the mdnu^m of B, which recurs in
S, I have given here prefer^ce to the reading of the Bengali version. I
may point out that it is the reading of the entire Bengali version, and not
of a few unimportant MSS., as Winternitz imagines. The readings are
these :

K manusatvdm updgatah
B mdnusm tanum dgatdh
S mdnusim yonim dgatdh,

This being the constellation of the readings, mdnusim and dgatdh are
as good as certain, as suggested by the agreement between B and S. There-
fore the real variant is only tanum : yonim. It is likely that the original
was yonim which was corrupted, in N, to tanum, and then the original pada
mdnusim tanum dgatdh (preserved in Bengali only) was replaced by the
recurrent tag mdnusatvam updgatdh ; but it is most unlikely that the latter
was the original which was changed in B to mdnusim tanum d°, and in S
to mdnusim yonim <5°. In any case, the Kasmiri reading must be rejected
here as secondary (cf. Prolegomena, p. lxii), as shown by the evidence of
B and S. Dn Di appear to have got their yonim from S (ibid. p. lxvii), and
f? Vi possibly from Dn.

1. 93. 11 : devadevarsisevitam.

Winternitz is mistaken in thinking that the hermitage in question was
frequented by Ifeis only, and not by gods as well. In fact, the talk is not
about a hermitage at all, but about the £107} forest {vanam) containing
the hermitage. Moreover, it was not an ordinary hermitage, but the hermit-
age of Vasi^tha, situated on the slopes of the celestial mount Meru (1. 93.
15 f.) :

Vasi^tho ndma iti sa khydta dpava ity uta || 15
tasydstamapadam punyam mrgapdksigandmitam |

Meroh pdrsve nagendrasya sarvartukusumdvrtam ] [ 16

The forest, therefore, in which Vasi^tha’s hermitage was situated, was
inhabited and frequented by divine r§is (like Vasi§tha) and by gods (like
the Vasus). That is how, in fact, the Vasus found themselves in that her-
mitage on that fateful day. If the forest were not frequented by gods, the
Vasus would not have cotne there at all. If we adopt the reading devd
devar^isevitam (which is plausible) then the compound must be taken to



EPIC STUDIES IV


259


mean “frequented by gods and jsis” (and not by divine j^is, as Winter-
nitz understands it). According to our text, the forest was frequented by
gods and divine T§is. As will be seen, there is not much to choose 'between
the readings, but I prefer the text, because only the divine |T?is like Vasi§tha
could reach those regions, not ordinary r§is. Moreover, such adjectives
(forming the entire second half of the line) are extremely common in the
descriptions of sacred forests, hermitages, tirthas, with many variants, as
may be seen from the following examples from the Aranyaka' (Bom. Ed.) :

3. 82. 41 devarsipitrsevita

84. 46 siddhagandharvasevita
87. 5 rdjarsigmasevita
89. 7 devagandharvasevita

89. 8 devarsiganasevita

90. 21 brahmarsiganasevita
156. 10 siddhacdrmapujita
     and 145. 41 devadevarsipujita,

which latter has our combination devadevarsi, and in which deva cannot be
separated from devarsi, for the stanza reads :

tatrdpasyata dharmdtmd devadevarsipujitam |
Nara-Ndrdyanasthdnam Bhdgirathyopasobhitam [ 1

The adjective devadevarsisevitam (or ""pujitam) is used with reference
to the most sacred and inaccessible regions like the {lOSj penance groves
cn Meru or Gandhamadana, or on the Himalayan peaks. I do not wish
to suggest that the simple phrase devarsisevitam would not have sufficed
here. I only want to show that tliere is nothing wrong with the text read-
ing, which is proved by the Kasmiri version ('^^ K). From the graphical
point of view, the difference between the readings (devd and deva-) is so
slight that the documentary evidence actually counts here for very little. It
is just owing to this uncertainty that the reading has been underlined in the
critical text.

1. 214. 9 : Dharmmdje * atiprityd.

Here again we notice Winternitz’s prejudice against hiatus; to which
I had drawn attention in tlie discussion on 1. 57. 20, above. But here my
case is stronger still. As far as the Vedic tradition is concerned, e (like o)
remained unchanged before a which was generally elided in the written text,
but, according to the evidence of metre, must almost invariably in the
Bgveda and generally in the Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, be pronounced
whether written or not. According to the statistics prepared by Vedic
scholars, it must be pronounced in the Rgveda in 99 per cent of the cases,
in the Atharvaveda and the metrical portion of the Yajurveda, in about
80 per cent of its occurrences. This shows that in the older stages of the



260


EPIC STUDIES


language, at any. rate, any Sandhi between final e (or o) and initial a was
rare. The rule becomes more and more rigid as we advance, until with
classical authors, ignorance or violation of the rule came to be regarded
as a capital blunder. Now the Mbh., whatever its age be, stands unques-
tionably midway between the Vedic and the classical epoch, and therefore
partakes naturally of the linguistic characteristics of both. In the Vedic
literature, where the scribes or editors did not dare to add even a single
syllable to the received text, the later antipathy towards hiatus shows itself
in the efforts to coalesce, in the written text, the adjoining vowels, accord-
ing to rules of (Sanskrit) grammar, leaving a correct but unmetrical and
unreadable line. The subterfuge is however so obvious that no one hesitates
to dissolve the Sandhi automatically and restore the hiatus. Much reluctance
is felt, on the other hand, by scholars £109} in admitting that the epic text
likewise contained originally many instances of hiatus, though of course
they are not as frequent as in the Veda. The reluctance is due to two
causes. Firstly the Mbh. text looks on the surface so like a classical text
that scholars, who have so far studied the text mainly from printed editions,
insist on applying rules of classical grammar to the text. The second reason
is that the ancient redactors who had not the same compunction about
making small adterations in the epic text (as is evident from our critical
apparatus) as they had in the case of the Vedic texts, have not resorted
to coalescence in order to remove the hiatus, but have boldly added little
expletives like cc, tu, hi for saving their precious rules of grammar, a pro-
cedure which, as it leaves tlie line metrically intact, makes the detection
of their nefarious interference difficult, if not impossible. Now though the
Mbh. looks on the surface like a classical text, there are many peculiarities
of Sandhi and grammar — even in the printed editions and the Vulgate —
which distinguish it from a classical text. Coalescence unknown to classical
usage is seen in amale Hmanam (1. 68. 64), te 'jhaya (1. 70. 41), manyate
'tmdnam (1. 198. 19). We have hiatus in a compound in Ndrdyam-
urogatah (1. 16. 35) ; Pragrhya Sandhi in samupete 'dbhute 'naghe (fern,
du. 1. 14. 5), jajhate 'stravi sdradau (1. 57. 88) etc. Double crasis in pama-
gdbhavan (1. 21. 6), Vasumanabravit (1. 87, 18), jdyateti (1. 11. 13).
Hiatus between padas, caused by the change of as to o (1. 76. 35) : jagdma
svapuram hr^to mujndta mahdtmand. Frequently we come across Prakritic
Absolutives like gjhya (1. 2. 93 ; 9. 19 ; 39. 23, 30 ; 119. 16 ; 123. 12, 16,
50; 124. 20 etc.), tosya (1. 1. 109), cintya (1. 9. 2), u.syn (1. 71. 58),
etc. etc, ; and the converse {tvd for ya) in sam-pujayiivd (1. 54. 15), d-
nayitvd (1. 66. 12), nu^mitvd (1. 85. 18), mu-sktvdnugatvd ca (1. 133.
24), prdpayitvd (1. 189. 25) etc., some of which may however, be explained
as absolutives of verbs with separable prepositions. Such a separable pre-
position we have in 1. 65. 34 :

firati sravanapurvdm naksatrdm sasarja ha j,



EPIC STUDIES IV


261


where prati is to be construed with sasarja, as pratisasarja : a line often
misunderstood by editors, commentators and translators alike. These vio-
lations of (Sanskrit) grammar are not so rare that one has to hunt for them
with a microscope. There is an endless list of fllO} them. One meets with
them at every step. If these and scores of other irregularities do occur as a
matter of fact, why could there not be hiatus as well ? Scholars are not yet
familiar with this phenomenon, because they have been dealings so far, with
the clarified text, from which most of these irregularities have been carefully
expunged, as is evident from our critical apparatus, by purists who have had
the handling of the epic text during a long succession of centuries. I have
noted that even Bohtlingk, who was otherwise a careful and conscious
editor, has in editing Mbh. passages for his Chresthamathie, rigidly enforced
Sandhi rules, even in prose passaged, with a zeal which was worthy of a better
cause, where there was not the slightest manuscript authority for doing so.
My study of the Mbh. MSS during the last t ten years has convinced me now
that it is the grammatical and material irregularities of the original that are
responsible for quite a large fraction of the mass of variations which we
come across Jn the MSS. The correctness of my reconstructions can be
proved only by adducing the entire evidence, which it is not possible to do
here, but which may be undertaken later on, when a large part of the text
has been dealt with in a like manner. I am fully persuaded that the Critical
Edition, as it advances, will supply material for confirming most of my con-
clusions. — To return to the case under consideration. Winternitz points out
that hi is found in all N MSS., including iSj, but he ignores that Kj shows
here tu, not hi ? Now is a clear transcript of a Sarada MS., and agrees
with our §1 to such an extent that I have expressed it as my opinion that it
is a copy of a ^rada original very similar to our '^radia MS. It is, no
doubt, a very small and insignificant variation, but how would Winternitz
explain it all the same ? hya cannot be misread as tva, even in the Sarada
script. Why should just Ki show here tva ? Is it not, perhaps, because a not
very distant ancestor of our and Ki had still the obnoxious hiatus, as in
our text ? The KaiSmIri version does contain many original features and
archaisms.

1. 215. 2 : ekdm trptim prayacchatdm.
        prayacchatdm of the text, I may point out, is not entirely wrong ; it may
        be construed with bhavcmtau, understood, ai more £111} respectful form of
        address than the second person. In stanza 5, however, the reading sampra-
        yacchata^m has been accepted, because the subject in the second person
        iytwdm) is expressed. We cannot argue that since in 5 we have sampra-
        yacchatiam, therefore in 2 we must have also prayacchatam. Because in
        the Mbh., which is not and never was polished literature, we do come across
        such strange yoke-fellows. Changes of subject and changes of construction
        are frequent. That is the view I had taken when I adopted the text reading.



262


EPIC STUDIES


But on second thoughts I decided that prayacchatcm would nevertheless be
a better reading, and the correction now proposed by Winternitz had been
already published by me, in the “ Addenda et Corrigienda,’' at the end of the
volume (p. 996).

1. 216 . 10

sasarja yat svatapasa Bhauvano bhuvanaprabhuh |
pfajapatir mirdesyam yasya rupam raver iva 1 1
The matter is not simple as Winternitz imagines. Of course, with the
reading yani, any one can see that the relative may be construed with rathmn
in 8. We then get two sentences : '‘Which (scil. chariot of Arjuna) was
fashioned by Bhauvana. .. .by (the power of) his austerities,” and “whose
beauty was like that of the sun.” But the reading yat is actually found in
(except Kq) ViG (except GJ ; i.e. in the Kasmiri version (except Kq),
agreeing with the Grantha version (except GJ, plus the Maithili MS. How
is it that so many MSS. give what Winternitz considers, an “ impossible ”
reading ? The reading is, in fact, not impossible at all ; only the construc-
tion is a little involved and difficult to understand. By reading yat we
actually get better sense. Construe : yasya, raver iva, yat anirdesyam rupam,
{tat) Bhauvamh. .svatapasa sasarja, “whose indefinable (or incompar-
able) loveliness (or splendour), like that of the Sun, Bhauvana had fashioned
by (the power of) his austerities.” This construction avoids the two dis-
jointed and halting sentences yam anirdesyarn Bhauvanaf ^. . . .svatapasa sa-
sarja, and yasya rupam raver iva (or yam Bhauvmah. . . .svatapasa sasarja,
and yasya anirdesyam rupam raver iva), which result from the wrong read-
ing ymn for {112} yat, yat is almost a perfect example of the lectio diffi-
cilior, and a regular trap for unwary editors.

1 . 218 . 14 : jaladhdrdmuQo 'kuldn.

Winternitz is here again mistaken in thinking that ""mucotuldn is the
reading of S. It is the reading of only five of the thirteen Southern MSS.
('Ti Gj. 2 M3.5) ; three others (T3 G3.4) read °mucofUlm, *three more (Mg.g)
read mumocivan, two (G5.3) read as in text {"^mucokulm). The question is,
in fact, what was the original riding of S. That question I have not been
able to answer definitely, and I have, therefore, put in, as a stap-gap, the
reading of Gg.e which seemed to me not improbable, since initial d is curi-
ously enough, sporadically treated in the Mbh. text, like a. The reading
""mmakuldn is useless ; it is obviously a substitute for some reading which
was difficult to understand or explain.

I have underlined muco in the text, but I now think that it is as good
as certain. It is documented not only by the whole of S, but also by Ko.^.a
Sf Yjy^. If muoo be admitted, then samdhUdn of the .Northern group be-
comes secondary, but with an important residue in the shape of the final
kuldn, agreeing with the final of °mucokuldn of Gg rhyming with

tutdn of Ko.3 Ti Gi. 3. Mg 5^ and finally reflected faintly in muconildn Tg G.. ,
The documentary evidence, therefore, points unmistakably to a reading jala-
dhardmuco{x)ldn. Query, what is the value ot x? The adjective dkuldn (“ con-
fused”) qualifying meghdn would be not inappropriate, referring to the con-
dition of masses of clouds confusedly hurled about by a! cyclonic wind ; not
so appropriate, to my mind, the atuldn (“incomparable”) preferred by
WiNTERNiTZ, and adopted by P. P. S. Sastri, against the evidence of his
basic MS. 3?, which has our text reading. In Sastri’s adoption of atuldn
and his ignoring of variants, which must have appeared to him meaningless
corruptions or clerical mistakes, we have an illuminating example of how the
readings get indiscriminately distributed, disturbing the relationships estab-
lished by the stemma codicum, and how the lectio difficilior is gradually effaced.

£113} 1. 218. 27 : vydtisthanta mahaupsali

The text reading vydtisthanta, it must be confessed, has not been adopt-
ed because it is the reading of Sj Ki ; it is a mere slip. I am thankful to
WiNTERNiTZ for drawing my attention to it. The reading vyatisthmta should
be adopted without doubt.

t * *

I may repeat here what I l^ve stated elsewhere that the problem of the
Mahabh^ata Textual Criticism is a problem sui generis. Here the princi-
ples of textual reconstruction, which must be first evolved from a study of the
MS. material and the MS. tradition, can be considered as finally settled only
after considerable discussion and exchange of ideas on the subject. I would,
therefore, repeat my request to Prof. Winternitz, made some years ago, to
continue his searching and exhaustive examination of the fascicules or volumes
as they come out, and give us the benefit of his ripe experience and valuable
opinions and findings. His publications on a subject which has engaged his
attention, off and on, for the la^ forty years cannot but throw some much-
needed light on the obscure question of the Mahabharata Textual Criticism
(which has unfortunately not received much attention so far from scholars),
and thus advance the cause of Matebharata studies.

In conclusion, I must express my grateful thanks to Prof. Winternitz
for the very kind and encouraging remarks he has made regarding the work
in general as also my keen appreciation of the uniformly courteous tone of
his sympathetic and appreciative review.

## Notes on Mahabharata Commentators

§ 1. Chronological Notes.

A necessary complement to a critical study of the Mahabharata is an
intensive study of the commentaries of the Mahabharata, of which there is


[ABORI 17. 185-202).



264


EPIC STUDIES


quite a large number preserved still, mostly in manuscript form. Among
the scholiasts who have written commentaries on the Mahabharata~~either
on the whole, or only on selected parts of the Great Epic— are : ( 1 ) Ananta-
bhatta, (2) Arjunamisra, (3) Anaiida, (4) Caturbhuja(misra), (5) Jaga-
disacakravartin, (6) Devabodha, (7) Nilakajifha, (8) Mahanandapuroa,
(9) Yajha-Narayapa, (10) Ratnagarbha, (11) Ramakimkara, (12) Rama-
krsua, (13) Ramanuja, (14) Lak^maija, (15) Varada, (16) V^iraja, (17)
Vidyasagara, (18) Vimalabodha, (19) Samkaracarya, (20) Srinivasa, (21),
Sarvajna-Narayaloa, and (22) Sr§tidhara. Very little is at present known
about these commentators : only very few of them have been, so far, pub-
lished. The only collective study made of these commentaries is by Holtz-
MANN in Das Mahdhhdrata, VoL 3, p. 67 ff., and that was in 1897, that
is, nearly forty years ago. The material at his disposal was very scanty,
and so are his notes.

But the study of these commentaries must be now taken up more seri-
ously, not so much for the sake of the explanations contained in the com-
mentaries — though even the glosses of a commentator like Devabodha are
extremely important — ^as for the readings and pafhantaras recorded in them ;
because, most of £186} the commentaries are older — some very much older
—than our manuscripts ; and therefore the documentation of these readings
by the commentators takes us back a stalge further in our investigation of
the history of the epic.

The usefulness of these commentaries is, however, considerably dimini-
shed by the fact that we know next to nothing about these commentators
themselves. In*particular, we lack information about their dates, which are
not easy to fix in Indian literature. Even if the dates cannot be determined,
it would be a great help if we could fix their relative chronology. An at-
tempt is made in the following pages to fix, to start with, the relative
chronology of some of the more important Mahabharata commentators.

A fixed point in the exegetical literature centering round the Mbh. is
furnished by Nilakaptha, who until lately was considered, at least in India,
as the most trustworthy guide for the exposition of the Great Epic, and
about whose date there is not much doubt. The available personal data
about him has been put together by Wilhelm Printz in the biographical note
on Mlakaiptha appended to his Berlin dissertation entitled Bhd^aworter in
Nilakantha's Bhdratabhdvadipa und in anderen Smskriihommentmen.^
Nilakaajtha'. according to his own statements, was a Mahara§>tra Brahmin
of the Gautama Gotra, with the surname Caturdhara (modem Chaudhari),
eldest son of Govinda Suri and Phullambika, residing at Kurparagmma
(modem Kopargaon) on the Godavari. ISRlakantha wrote his commentary

cularly p. 70 f.

on the Mbh. ahd on the Gaoesagjta (a section of the GaBiesapuraoa) in
Benares, in the last quarter of the seventeenth century,^ the latter (Gaioesa-
^tia) being composed in a.d. 1694.®

In the beginning of his commentary on the Mbh. Nllakantha
tells us that before writing his commentary, the Bharaiabhdvadipfi, he had
compared many {bahun) copies of the Mbh., collect-£l87}-ed together from
different parts of India (vibhinnadesydn) in order to ascertain the correct
reading {pat ham agryam) and also consulted older commentaries.'^ We ac-
cordingly find that he frequently mentions variant readings and “ additional ”
passages found in the versions consulted by him, and he cites the explana-
tions given by older scholiasts information, scanty though it be, of im-
mense interest and value for the history of the received text.

(z) Devabodha and Sarvajna-N drdyana.

In marked contrast to Nilakaajtha stands Devabodha, whom I regard
as probably the oldest and therefore the most important commentator of the
Mbh. He is extremely reticent about himself atid his predecessors, but is
cited or mentioned by several commentators, who must therefore have lived
after him. ^ One of such successors of Devabodha was Sarvajha-Narayana.
Sarvajha’s Bhdr atari haprakdsa has fortunately been preserved, though it is
not definitely known whether his commentary on all the eighteen parvans of
the Mbh. is now available. His commentary on the Virata and the Udyoga
has already been published by Mahadeva Shastri Bakre." The Bombay
Government MSS. Collection (No. 180 of 1891-95) contains a fragment of
his commentary on the Adi, comprising merely the first adhyaya with the
beginning of the second ; while the Madras Government Collection (No. 2169)
contains another fragment which lacks the beginning. In the colophon of
the latter MS., Sarvajha is styled paramahamsar-parivrdjakdcdrya ; he was
therefore a sarhnyasin.

Now Sarvajna explicitly refers to Devabodha in the beginning of his
commentary on the Udyoga :

1 He was apparently a protege of Anupasiihha, who was a contemporary of
Shah Jahan.

® The year of composition is given as Sarhvat 1750, The name of the com-
mentary is Gaj^patibhdvadipikd, Cf. the name of his Mbh. commentary, Bharata-
bhdvadlpa ; see next note.

£ 188 } This stanza is curiously enough not found in the commentary
of Sarvajiia as printed in the GujaiatS Press edition of the Udyoga, but
occurs in both the MSS. of the work in the Bombay Government Collection
(deposited at the Institute), bearing Nos. 33 of A 1879-80 and 168 of
1884-87 respectively. The priority of Devabodha is, however, independ-
ently established by another direct reference to Devabodha in the body of
the published commentary itself, to which my attention was recently drawn
by my friend and colleague Professor Sushil Kumar De of Dacca Univer-
sity, who is editing the Udyoga for the Institute. In Sarvajna’s comment
on B|. 5. 96. 41 (on p. 327 of the Gujarati Printing Press edition), we find ;

This quotation can unfortunately not be verified ; for in the very old
Bengal Asiatic Society’s palm-leaf MS. (No. 3399) of the unpublished com-
mentary on the Udyoga by Devabodha the corresponding folio is missing I
But there is no reason to doubt its authenticity.

This establishes Devabodha’s priority to Sarvajna. We therefore get

Now this Sarvajna-Narayaha must be identical — ^as has indeed been
assumed by Jolly,^ Buhler,^ Holtzmann,^ and others-''’— with the Sarvajfia-
Narayaina (also called Narayana-Sarvajfia) the author of the Manvarthavrtti
or Manvarthanibandha, a £189} well-known commentary on the Manusmrti,
published by V. N. Mandlik.® The assumed identity of the two commen-
tators at present rests, it is true, merely on the identity of the names, but
can scarcely be regarded on that account as doubtful. It is hardly conceiv-
able that there were two different Sarvajha-Naiayanas, both commentators
of well-known works on Dharmasastra like the Mahabharata and the
Manusmrti.

The date of Sarvajna has been fixed on the basis of certain quotations.^

Buhler cautiously remarks that Sarvajna-Narayaiua ‘'cannot have written
later than in the last half of the fourteenth century/’^ but the recent resear-
ches of Kane tend to show that Sarvajna flourished between a.d. 1100 and
1300.^

(zf) Arjimamisra.^

Both Devabodha and Sarvajna are mentioned and cited several times by
the Bengali commentator Arjunamisra, the manner in which Arjunamisra
refers to Devabodha suggesting that in his time Devabodha’s commentary
possessed an established reputation. These references are as follows :

(a) In the foreword to his scholium (Bombay Govt. Coll. No. 30 of
A 1879-80 = Dai of the Critical Edition), Arjuna pays homage to his prede-
cessors, citing by name several of them. Devabodha, he mentions with
special reverence, whose commentary (among others) he had carefully
studied before writing his own commentary on the Mbh.:

Worth noting is the fact that in the long series of names of Bharata-
caryas cited by Arjuna at the beginning of the above extract, the
first four names Vyasa and Vai§almpayana, Devabodha £190} and Sarv^ajna
have been recited in the correct order of precedence and chronology, a point
to which we shall return in the sequel.

(b) Arjuna mentions the Acaryas again in the list of his (immediate
and remote) “Gurus’', placing this time Devabodha at the head of the list,
which ends with the name of his father, who (as we know from other sources)
was a well-known reciter {pdthakaY of the Mbh.

(d) Finally, while commenting on 1. 143. 34 (a difficult stanza, giving
a fanciful derivation of the name Ghatotkaca), Arjuna mentions two read-
ings which had both won the approval of Devabodha :

(sic) 1 ^

These two readings are in fact mentioned by Devabodha : vide fol. 37^
of the Baroda MS. of Devabodha's commentary on the Adi.

The above extracts taken together indisputably prove that Arjunamisra
was posterior to both Devabodha and Sarvajna-Narayaiia. Adding the name
of Arjunamisra to Series 1, we get

Series 2: D ev a^b o dha — Sarvajna — Arjunamisra,

Some faint light on the question of the age of Arjunamisra is thrown by
a dated MS. of Arjuna's commentary listed by the late M. M. Haraprasada
Sastri in his Notices of Sanskrit MSS., Second £191} Series, Vol. I (Cal-
cutta 1900), p. 298 (MS. No. 295). The late Mahamahopadhyaya reported
that it was a carefully written palm-leaf MS. of Arjuna’s commentary on the
Mokiadharma, called Moksadharmdrthadlpikd written in archaic Bengali
characters and belonging, apparently, to Babu Saradaprasanna Ghose of
Kelomal, Tamluk. The MS- gave the date of writing as Saka 1456 (ca.
A.D. 1534).®

I may here draw attention to some stanzas added by the copyist, which
are to the eiffect that already at the time when the copy was made, correct
MSS. of Arjuna’s commentary were a rarity even in Bengal, the home of the
commentator, which can only be explained by assuming, as pointed out
already by Mahadeva Shastri Bakre that there was a considerable interval
of time between the two. The stanzas I am ref ei ring to are :

%5iT srsjuiwft

The date iSaka 1456 (ca. a. d. 1534) is then the lower limit of the age of
Axjuna, but the date of Arjuna, if we rely on the information vouchsafed by
the copyist, must be long prior to A. d. 1534.

(Hi) Nilaka^tha.

We return to NHakaibtha, who is the next great Mbh. commentator, and
who cites or mentions Devabodha, Sarvajfia-Naray^ and Arjunamisra, not

indeed in the introduction to his commentary on the Mbh., where he mentions
a number of his ‘‘ Gurus ”, but elsewhere in the course of his well-known
scholium. Here are the references.

(a) While commenting on 1. 158. 14, a stanza with numerous variants,
Nilakajitha cites an old variant of the entire stanza, mentioning Devabodha
in that connection.

iT ^V- fr ^ ^ 1

1% m ii

[192} 5JI^: I '■

it is worthy of note that Nilakantha regards the variants as ancient,
owing to its having been explained by ” Devabodha and others ”. He must
therefore consider Devabodha as an ancient authority.

What N51akai.itha regards as ancient is of course a matter for specula-
tion. Nevertheless I do not think that Nilakajntha would have used the word
pTdctna in connection with Devabodha unless the interval between them was
at least three or four centuries.

In passir'g it may be mentioned that this reference to Devabodha by
Nilakaintha is yet another instance of the practice of mentioning names of
Acaryas honoris causa (pujMham)," because the reading cited by Nila-
kaotha is probably not that of Devabodha at all, who to judge by the lem-
mata in his commentary must have had before him a stanza differing from
the corresponding stanza of the Critical Ekiition merely in reading sakundh
for kutitapdli of the Critical Edition (1. 158. 14). The third pada of the
stanza as cited by Nilakahtha is certainly the reading of the T G version,
found otherwise only in three conflated N MSS., and in a fourth one written
in the margin ; while the last pada was found by me only in four MSS. (Kg
Ba M 3 . 5 ) of my critical apparatus, one of them (B 3 ) having as a matter of
fact the reading of our text in the margin ! It is therefore most improbable
that Devabodha had commented on the particular variant version cited by
Nllakaptha, and it is really doubtful to me whether Nilkaajtha had at all
Devabodha’ s commentary before him. Devabodha is referred to by Nila-
kaiptha merely as one of the ancient Acaryas.

(b) While commenting on B. 7. 82. 2, Nilakamtha notices a variant
interpretation of madhuparkika given by Devabodha :

(c) NSlakaiotha’s reference to Sarvajna will be found in his comment
on B. 5 . 40. 10 (Gujarati Printing Press ed., p. 131) :

and afeain in the same adhyaya, a few stanzas further on (B. 5. 40. 26),
we find ;

I JIRFPir: I I

^ BTit arrai^einJ: I

A reference to Sarvajna's commentary printed in the same work
(p. 131 f.) will show that all these explanations do as a matter of fact occur
in the commentary of Sarvajha, while they are not met with in any of the
three other commentaries printed there.

(d) For Nilakaotha’s mention of Arjunamisra, I may draw attention tc
Nilakajptha’s comment on B. 3. 291. 70, a stanza at the end of the Ramo
pakhyana, where he mentions various explanations of the word jdruthya,
among them the one given by Arjunamisra, whom he mentions by name :

These various extracts establi^ the posteriority of Nilakaajtha to Deva-
bodha, Sarvajha-Narayana and Arjunamisra. Adding Nilakantha to
Series 2, we get

Series 3 : Devabodh a — S ar v a j n a —

Ar junamisr a — N ilakaritha.

It will be remembered that as each member of this series of four names
clearly cites one or more of his predecessors, this is a chronological sequence
whose correctness is absolutely incontrovertible.

( iv ) Vimalabodha.

There is moreover a subsidiary series connected with a Mbh. commen-
tator called Vimalabodha,^ to which we shall now turn our attention.

It will be recalled that in the excerpts given above from the commentary
of Arjunamisra, the commentator twice mentions Vimalabodha in close proxi-
mity to Devabodha. Therefore it is evident that Arjunamisra is posterior
to Vimalabodha, whose commentary (tika) variously known as Durghafartha-
prakdsim £194} or Vi^amasloki has fortunately been preserved. In the intro-
duction to this unpublished commentary, a copy of which is to be found in
the Bombay Government Collection (No. 84 of 1869-70), while speaking of
his predecessors, Vimalabodha says (fol. 1) :

II

Again while giving the etymologies of the name of the Suta, Loma- (or
Roma-)har§a|ija, Vimalabodha observes (fol. 2) ;

See Holtzmann, op. cit. vol. Z, p. 72.



EPIC STUDIES V


271


Undoubtedly the Devasvamin mentioned in the first excerpt is the same
as the Devabodha (who in the colophons of his commentary is styled parama-
hmhsa-pmvrdjakdcdrya) in the second. Incidentally it may be pointed out
that the etymology of Loma- (or Roma-)har§aipa mentioned by Vimalabodha
is actually to be found in Devabodha’s scholium. In the Baroda MS.
(11372) of the unpubli^ed commentary of Devabodha, we read (fol. 3 b,
line If.):

^fTT i ,

which substantially agrees with the excerpt in the commentary of Vimala-
bodh^.

Since Arjunamisra mentions Vimalabodha, and Vimalabodha cites Deva-
bodha, we get a subsidiary series, namely.

Series 4 : Devabodh a — V im\alabodh a — A rjunamisra.

Thus far we have been treading on solid ground and the correctness of
Series 1-4 is, as far as I can judge, absolutely unimpeachable.

In trying to combine Series 3 and 4, however, there arises the difficulty
that no cross reference has hitherto been found in the works of Vimalabodha
on the one hand and Sarvajna-Narayana on the other. Their relative chrono-
logical position is, therefore, a matter for speculation. It is possible, how-
ever, to combine the two series tentotivelyf on the equivocal testimony of
Arjunamisra, which we shall proceed to examine more closely.

£195} In one of the lists of the Acaryas cited by Arjunamisra, we have
the sequence , Veda-Vyasa, Vaisaiiipayana, Devabodha, Vimalabodha,
Sarvajna-Narayaipa, San^cjilya Madhava. Here the first two pairs, as was
pointed out above, have been named in the correct chronological order, the
earlier author being placed first, in conformity with the rule governing the
sequence of the members of a Dvandva compound (P. 2.2.34 Va. ). Deva-
bodha is, as we have seen, prior to Vimalabodha as surely as Vyasa, the
reputed author of the Great Epic, is prior to Vaisaimpayana. Further in
both lists the father of Arjunami!§ra is mentioned last. These facts suggest
the surmise that the whole series is arranged in the strict chronological
sequence. If this surmise be correct, then Sarvajna-NaiayaTja would be
posterior to Vimalabodha, and we get, tentatively, the sequence : Vimala-
bodha — Sarvajfia.

It may, however, be noted that such names are often found arranged on
the diametrically opposite principle of uttaroitmaganyastva, i.e., naming the
more important persons later, which is however not admissible in the parti-
cular instance ; or even a;rranged on no principle at all ; or at least on some
principle which it is difficult for us to comprehend. In fact a subsequent
enumeration of these same Acaryas by the same Arjunamisra is in partial
conflict with the earlier list ! There the sequence (already given above) is



272


EPIC STUDIES


Devabodha, Vimalabodha, Saiidilya Madhava, Niarayaina-Sarvajfla. Here
Sarvajna-Narayana has been placed after isandilya Madhava, while in the
former list he is placed bepre them ! This irregularity apart, the lists tally
with each other.

It is not, however, impossible to resolve this contradiction and harmonize
the data. There is a notable difference between the two lists. The first one
is in prose, the ^ond is an anu^ubh stanza. I am disposed to attach more
importance to the sequence of the prose enumeration, and to regard the change
of sequence in the other as due to the exigencies of metre. The first again
is a formal expression of homage {namaskriyd) , where the principle of prior-
ity has been, it seems, rigidly observed ; on the other hand, the second is
merely a collective metrical list of the author’s “ Gurus,” where the considera-
tion of rank and precedence did {196} not perhaps prevail so much. I may
also point out tliat the first list is in the form of a Dvandva compound, while
in the second the persons have been all independently mentioned. If these
considerations have any value, then we may postulate, at least tentatively,
another series.

Series 5 : D ev Ub o dk a — V imalabod h a —

Sarv a jn a — A r fun a—N xlakantha,

where the relative position of Vimalabodha and Sarvajna alone is open to
doubt.

Of these five commentators, as was mentioned above, Sarvajna could not
have lived later than the latter half of the fourteenth century and flourished
probably between a. d, 1100 and 1300 ; while Arjunami^ra lived some time
prior to a. d. 1534.^ Moreover, if the position assigned in Series 5 to
Sarvajna be correct, then both Devabodha and Vimalabodha must have lived
long prior to A. D. 1300.^

§ 2. What was Devabodha’s Version of the Mahabharata Like ?

The only commentary of the Mahabharata completely printed so far is

1 Since the above was written, two efforts have been made to fix the date of
Arjunamisra. Mr. Jogendra Chandra Ghosh (Indian Culture, Vol. I, p. 706 ff.),
working on the data supplied by certain ancient pedigrees preserved in Bengal,
arrives at the date ca. a.d. 1300 for Arjunamilra ; but it may be pointed out that
the method of fixing precise dates on the basis of pedigrees alone never gives entirely
reliable results. On the other hand, Mr. P. K. Code of the Bhandarkar Institute
(Indian Culture, Vol. 2, p. 141 ff.), relying on his identification of the &tya-Khana,
who was a patron of Arjunamisra (see Sir f. J. Modi Commemoration Volume,
p. 566), argues for a date between a.d. 1450 and a.d. 15(K), There is thus a
difference of about 200 years between the two computations. But the matter is still
sub judice, and more li^t on the questicm may be expected from further investiga-
tion of the questicMi which is being carried on by these two sdiolars.

the Bhdratabhdvadtpa by Nilakantha. The Gujarati Printing Press of Bom-
bay has done, however, inestimable service to the cause of Mahabharata
studies by publishing other commentaries at least on the Virata and Udyoga,
edited by Mahadeva Shastri £197} Bakre. The Vinataparvan Volume
(published in 1915) contains, besides (1) the Bhdmtabhdvadipa, the com-
mentaries of (2) Arjunamisra, (3) Caturbhuja, (4) Vimalabodha, (5)
Ramakr§i:ia, (6) Sarvajha-Narayana and (7) Vadiraja, as also a commentary
called (8) the Vi^amapadavivarma of unknown authorship. The Udyoga-
parvan Volume (published in 1920) includes, on the other hand, besides (1)
the Bhdratabhdmdipa, the commentaries of (2) Arjunami§ra, (3) Vimala-
bodha, (4) Sarvajha-Narayaina and (5) Vadiraja.^ A commentary more
important than any of these and one more neglected still is the Jndnadlpikd
of Devabodha. Until recently nothing was in fact known about Devabodha
or his commentary on the Mahabharata save what is contained in perfunctory
notices of Sanskrit MSS., which has been summarized in Holtzman's meri-
torious work Das Mahdbhdrata (Vol. 3, section 14, para 3, p. 70 f.). A
selection of Devabodha’s readings and glosses was for the first time published
by me in che critical notes of the Adiparvan Volume.^

I have shown in the previous section that Devabodha is indubitably
earlier than Nllakaipta, Arjunamisra, Satvajna-Narayana or even Vimala-
bodha, and is therefore in all probability the earliest commentator of the
Mahabharata hitherto known. It is therefore needless to add that the com-
mentary is most valuable and its evidence, both positive and negative, of
supreme importance for the constitution of the text.

The MS. of the commentary (which is unaccompanied by the epic text)
utilized by me for the Adi belongs to the Baroda Central Library (Sanskrit
Section) and was kindly placed at my disposal by Dr. Benoytosh Bhatta-
CHARYA, Director of the Oriental Institute of Baroda, to whom my sincere
thanks are due for the kind loan.^ This paper MS. which bears the identifi-
cation No. 11372, contains the commentary on Adi only and is written
in £198} Devanagaii characters of about the seventeenth century. The bulk
of the MS. is in a fair state of preservation, though in many places the text
is extremely corrupt. In our MS. the name of the commentary is given as
Jndnadlpikd ; but, according to HOLTZMANN {op, cit. Vol. 3, p. 71), it is also
known as Mahdhhdrata-tdtparyafikd or tdtparyadlpikd. MSS. of this com-
mentary a‘re rare, and no complete copy has yet been found.


1 Vadiraja's cammentary on the Sabha has been published by Prof. P. P.
Subrahmanya Sastri as an Appendix to his edition of the Sabha according t e
Southern recension (Madras 1932). For Vadiraja^s date see further below (pp. 20i-
210) the note on the subject by Mr. P. K. Code.

EPIC STUDIES


In the colophon the author is described as paramahamsa-parivrdjaka.
He must therefore have belonged to an order of Sairiinyasins. The name of
his Guru is given as Satyabodha. This is all the personal data we have at
present about Devabodha.

The Jndnadtpikd is a concise flka, that is, a running commentary para-
phrasing the difficult words of the epic text and occasionally explaining the
gist or purport { tat par y a) of the original. The extent of the text of the
commentary on the Adi is given at the end of our MS. as 1,400 granthas.

The homage which Arjuna pays to Devabodha in the Introduction to his
scholium is by no means a matter of mere form. Arjuna appears to have
made a very close study indeed of the scholium of Devabodha, and based his
own commaitary, on the Adi at least, largely on that of his predecessor. He
has copied very large portions of Devabodha’s commentary, sometimes ver-
batim, sometimes in extracts. Moreover, even when the commentators differ,
the influence of Devabodha is plainly discernible. In fact, Arjuna’s Artha-
dtpikd may be considered, as I have remarked elsewhere,^ as a revised and
enlarged edition of Devabodha's Jndnadlpikd. Unlike the commentary of
Nllakaiotha, that of Devabodha is unaccompanied by the epic text. The
question, therefore, naturally arises what was Devabodha’s text like ?

When we read the commentary along with any of the old printed edi-
tions of the Mahabharata, like the Calcutta or the Bombay or the Kumbha-
fconam editions, we are at once struck by the singular disparity between the
text and the commentary. Not only does Devabodha's commentary contain
many words or expressions which do not occur at all in the Vulgate, but it
also cites, at times, verses or stanzas which read differently in the
£199} Vulgate, One also comes across passages and even adhyayas of the
Vulgate on which one expects some comment but which are left wholly un-
commented by Devabodha.

The Southern recension may be categorically ignored in our search for
the protot)q)e of Devabodha’s commentary, as this comtnentator does not
know even ?i single one of the many passages peculiar to the Southern recen-
sion. He further does not show the typical Southern transposition of the
Sakuntala and Yayiati episodes, nor the characteristic position of the prose
genealogical axihyaya (called puruvamSdnuh^tam) , after the chapter con-
taining the eulogy of the epic (JShdrataprasamsd) ,

The vulgate (with the Bengali) may likewise be excluded. It agrees
with Devabodha’s text up to a certain point ; but the divergences, which are
numerous, remain inexplicable. There remain then only the garada and the
“ K ” versiems. And with them, the version of Devabodha does, as a matter
of fact, show very close aflSnity.

It is worthy of note that Devabodha has no commentary on any of the


1 Adiparvan, Prolegomena, p. LXX.



EPIC STUDIES V


275


six adhyiayas of the Vulgate which are completely missing in the Sarada and
the K MSS. and which have also been completely omitted in the Critical Edi-
tion of the Adi. They are the following adhyiayas of the Vulgate : (i) adhy.
22 (duplicate description of the ocean) ; (ii) adhy. 24 (Aruna is appointed
charioteer of the Sun, an evident digression and interpolation) ; (iii) adhy.
116 (birth of Dubl^a : a fairy tale of questionable authenticity) ; (iv)
adhy, 139 (an absurd chapter describing further exploits of the Pans^Javas
and containing a reference to Yavana kings) ; (v) adhy, 140 (Kanikanati) ;
and finally, (vi) adhy. 149 (Paijdavas’ crossing the Ganges, a passage of
doubtful value).

But on principle, we cannot attach very great importance to such omis-
sions, as a commentator is apt to skip in the Mahabharata any adyhaya which
he thinks too simple to need any comment. This explanation will apply to
most of the omissions mentioned above, but will not hold good in the case of
the Kanikaniti an adhy. of 140 stanzas, which has evoked lengthy comments
from both Arjunamijsra and Nilakantha ; we expect some comment on this
adhyaya by a commentator like Devabodha.

{200} Much more important from our point of view is an addition
characteristic of the Kasmiri version,. This version adds at the very end of
the Adi a supplementary (and entirely superfluous) adhyaya, which contains
merely a variant version of the well-known Purapic tale of Svetaki s sacrifice,
occurring earlier in the course of this very parvan, and which was known to
K§emendra. Curiously enough the king who is called i§vetaki in the first
version is here called Svetaketu ! That the version of Devabodha contained
this interpolated (supplementary) adhyaya is proved by the concluding
remark of Devabodha on this adhyaya (fol. 48) :

^ 1

This remark, as I have pointed out elsewhere, will not apply to any ver-
sion which did not have the supplementary adhyaya containing the story of
gvetaketu, which in fact is peculiar to the §arada and the K versions. These
facts demonstrate that the version of Devabodha agrees with the Sara^ and
K versions with respect to both addition and omission of whole adhyayas.

The conclusion regarding the affinity between the two versions is fortified
by many minor agreements in point of shorter passages and even readings of
individual stanza^s.

For example, Devabodha has no comment on any portion of the Brahma-
Ga|Qie§a episode (40 stanzas in thq Vulgate), which is missing in its entirety
only in the Kasmiii and the Bengali versions. Again, for 1. 105. 4-7 of the
Critical Edition the Vulgate substitutes a lengthy passage of 56 lines, which
is entirely ignored in the commentary of Devabodha, who on the other hand
cites 7^^ (a line not known to the Vulgate), in exact agreement with the



276 EPIC STUDIES

Sarada and K versions (besides the Southern recension), but in direct oppo-
siticai to the Bengali and the Devaniagari versions. In connection with the
omission of. adhy. 139-140 of the Vulgate mentioned above, the iSarada and
K versions omit the first 19 stanzas of the following adhyiaya (namely, adhy.
141 of the Vulgate) . In conformity with that, the first 19 stanzas of adhy.
141 are ignored completely in the scholium of Devabodha. It may be noted
that the omission of adhy. 130-140 together with the first 19 stanzas of adhy.
141 of the Vulgate £201} makes an aggregate and continuous omission of 1.39
(=27 + 93-f-19) stanzas of the Vulgate, a not inconaderable portion of the
text. Likewise there is no commentary on nearly 70 stanzas of adhy. 128
and 129 of the Vulgate, which ate omitted only in the Sarada-K group and
the Critical Eldition.

This affinity is further borne out by agreements as regards minor read-
ings too numerous to mention.

These considerations make it, in my opinion, perfectly clear that the
version of Devabodha is closely allied to the Sarada and K versions.

Though the isarada version and what I have called the “ K ” version run
for the most part parallel to each other, there are in fact minor discrepancies
between the MSS. of these versions, which indicate different sources. But as,
on the one hand, we have for the Adi a solitary MS. (6i) of the genuine
iSarada (or Kasmiri) version, and on the other hand we do not know the
provenance of the Devanagari MSS. which I have denoted by the symbol
“K” (on account of their affinity to the version of Ka4mir), it is at this
stage not easy to explain these discrepancies between i^iarada and K. It would
be also premature to say whether Devabodha’s version was more akin to
Sarada or the K version.

I may, however, draw attention to one instance which suggests to my
mind and affinity with K rather than with the Sarada version. In 1. 68. 72
the text reading is asatyavacam nary ah (nom. plu.), “women (are) perfidi-
ous,” a general statement. Only Kj.j Bj (m as in text) have, on the other
hand, asatyavacane ’ndrye (voc. sing.), “0 thou perfidious (and) dishonour-
able (woman) ! ” Ko ,4 appear to have corrupt forms of the same. The
vocative appears to be, therefore, peculiar to the K version, which differs here
from the Sarada, and which latter has the nom. plu. as in all other MSS.
Now in agreemait with K, Devabodha has amrye = vakre ! One instance of
an agreement like this is, I will readily admit, wholly inadequate to prove the
point. It can only give an indication and may perchance give wrong
indication. The question may, therefore, be left over for future investigation.

## The Bhrgus and the Bharata : A Text-Historical Study

The Bhrgus are unquestionably an interesting old clan.*^ Tempted by
the tantalizing affinity between the Sanskrit name Bhrgu and the Greek

in the name of ^Xevoas and of the ^Xsvvai, A. Weber^
postulated a genetic connection between the Indian and the Greek names,
and even ascribed Indo-germanic antiquity to a certain legend about Bhrgu
Vartuii preserved in the iSatapatha Brahmana (11. 6. 1), a legend of which
he thought he had discovered a parallel in Greek mythology. The facile
phonetic equation put up by Weber has not, however, commended itself to
other scholars, and we are not specially concerned with it either. But it
cannot be gainsaid that the clan is very ancient and that some of their legends
are of hoary antiquity. There are scattered notices about the Bhrgus to be
found from the Vedic Samhitas onwards through the Brahmana, Arapyaka
and Upani§ad literature up to the Epics and the Pur^as, steadily growing in
volume and importance.

£2} Not only is the clan ancient, its legends also are highly interesting.
So suggestive in fact are the early myths of this clan that they had in former
years engrossed the attention of many a student of Indian mythology, and
called forth a variety of interpretations. Thus, A. Bergagne^ looked upon
the Bhrgu myth of the Bgveda as merely a more developed form of the early
tradition about the descent of fire and identified Bhrgu with Agni. A. Kuhn^
and A. Barth® agreed in regarding the Bhrgus as personifications of the light-
ning flash, and Kuhn^ tried to harmonize the Greek myth regarding the des-
cent of fire with the Vedic. A. Weber, ^ as already remarked, saw in a legend
preserved in the' iSatapatha Brahmana a relic of primitive Indo-germanic
m 5 d:hology. But even the later legends of these people are not without a

certain amount of grandiosity and ostentation. Just consider the figure of
Parasurama : a matricide, annihilator of the K^atriyas and finally an avatdra
of Vii§jnLU (the “Preserver”) all in one.

The popularity of the Parasurama legend in India is attested by the
number of places, scattered all over India, which are associated with his name
and his exploits and held sacred to his memory.^ Near the Kangra
District‘d of the Punjab there is a very ancient temple dedicated to
Parasurama, (a name not yet applied to him in our epic), in which is depo-
sited a copper-plate grant recording the gift of a village to a Brahmin study-
ing the A. V. In the State of Udaipur^ there is a sacred pool called Mar-
kundiab where Rama is said to have bathed and atoned for his sins ;
likewise in Cape Comorin. In the Bijapur District^ of the Bombay
Presidency, an axe-shaped rock situated on a riverbank marks the spot
where Rama is represented as having washed his famous axe {para^u),
which has given him his nick-name Parasurama, Rama-with-the-Axe ; a stone
boulder situated in the river bed has preserved Parasurama’s foot-prints.
Even this irresistible axe of his has been deified, and there is in Mysore State^'^
a temple dedicated to it. Gokaijn^ shows a sacred pool dedicated to Maha-
deva, which is said to have been built by the son of Jamadagni. Even the
Lakhimpur District* of distant Assam has a pool to show to which, accord-
ing to popular belief, Parasurama had surrendered his dreaded axe, and
which attracts pilgrims from every part of India.

Notwithstanding the absorbing interest of the Bhargava myths, it is
primarily not their interpretation that is attempted here. {3} That is a task
fraught with difficulties and uncertainties, as also one which would call for a
range of knowledge and a compose of mind to which the present writer can
lay no claim. The modest aim of this paper is to collect and collate the
Bhargava references in the Mahabharata, in other words, to give a succinct
account of all that the Great Epic of India has to say about the Bhrgus. The
choice of the source-book is, I think, abundantly justified, because the Maha-
bharata, as I believe, is the richest mine for the exploration of the Bhargava
material, a veritable thesaurus of Bhargava legends, containing as it does
the largest number and the greatest variety of such legends. Even this
material is naturally not entirely new, having already attracted the attention
of scholars, but it seemed to me that it has not been studied with that degree
of attention to details which it deserves. It is a trite observation but never-

theless true that even what appears on the face of it to be a most insignificant
detail might yield a valuable clue if looked at from the correct angle, which
is often difficult to get.

My intention is to pass under review here all the important myths and
legends relating to the different Bhrgus, which occur in the Mahabharata,
subjecting them to a critical analysis : to study the manner in which they are
presented, to investigate their repetitions and even to examine their discre-
pancies. We shall find that there are many more Bhargavas mentioned in
our epic than commonly known and many more references to Bhargavas
than commonly suspected.

In essence, it must be admitted, this is merely a text-critical study, a
subject which, having engaged my attention for a number of years, has ac-
quired considerable fascination for me. But at the end of the paper it is
shown that the investigation might at the same time yield results which are
not without general value for a partial elucidation of the obscure history of
this venerable old text.

The BhargaVa references could have been presented here in many
different ways, but it appeared best to take them up for study in the sequence
in which they appear in our epic, to examine the material book by book and
chapter by chapter. The total number of passages of the Mahabharata in
which the Bhargavas are mentioned is astonishingly large. Exigencies of
space, {4} however, compelled the writer to restrict himself to the discussion
of only the more important of the references.

I add here a genealogical table which will enable the reader to follow
the legends of the Bhrgus and, the discussions about them with greater ease.
The table is made up from the data of the Mahabharata itself, but it is un-
doubtedly incomplete ; it appears to be very much abridged, lacking many
details and intermediate links.

ADIPARVANI

Strangely enough, already in the second chapter of the Adiparvan, the
Parvasarhgraha, which is in fact, for the greater part of it, something
like a Table of Contents, we make our acquaintance with one of the Bhar-
gavas, the most famous of them, Rama Jamadagnya,^ not yet a full-fledged
avatdra’^ a character which iri, reality has no connection whatsoever with the
action of the sublime tragedy which is going to be unfolded in the epic. That
comes about in this way. The place where the Mahabharata war was fought,
as everybody knows who knows anything at all about the war, was called
Kuruk^etra (Gita 1. 1) :

dharmaksetre Kuruk^etre samavetd yuyutsavah |
mdmakdh Pd};i4(wds caiva

But the Suta Ugratsravas, son of Lomahar§aoa, who recites the epic at
the twelve-year sacrificial session held in the Naimi^a Forest under the aus-
pices of Saunaka, gives the name of the place as Samantapancaka and is
careful enough to add that he had visited that sacred spot {punyam desam)
and was as a^matter of fact just returning from it (1. 1. 11 f.) :
Sammtapancakmi ndma punyam dvijanisevitam j
gatavdn asmi tarn desam yuddham yatrdbhavat pur a [|

Pdfidavdndm Kurund^h ca sarve^dih ca mxihlksitdm [
didrk^ur dgatas tasmdt samtparh bhavatdm iha ||

That obviously needed a little explication. Accordingly we find in the
beginning of the second chapter a query about this Samantapancaka from the
sages who formed the audience. They want to know all about this new place
of pilgrimage (1. 2. 1) :

Samantapancakam iti yad uktam sutanandma j
etat sarvam yathdnydyam srotum icchdmahe vayam ij
And from the story narrated by the Suta it proves to be a Bhargava place
of pilgrimage, situated probably somewhere in the neighbourhood of or with-
in the limits of Kuruk§etra.^ It was in fact, as the Suta proceeds to explain,

the sacred spot where the Bhargava Rama, the foremost of weapon-bearers
{sastrabhjt^ varalp^ 1. 2. 3), after extirpating the warrior race during the
interval between the Treta and the Dvapara Ages, had made five pools of
blood, probably forming a circle (hence obviously Samantapahcaka), and
standing in the middle of the pools the terrible man offered the uncanny
oblation of congealed blood to his forefathers, until the shades of the departed
ancestors appeared before him and pacified him, giving him the boon that
those sanguinary pools of his would become holy places of pilgrimage (1. 2,
3 ff.):

A few stanzas later we read that the Kuru-Paipdava war was also
fought at this Samantapancaka (1. 2. 9) :

antare caiva samprdpte Kali-Dvdparayor abhut 1
Samantapancake yuddham Kuru-Pdndavasenayob |j
Samantapahcaka is thus made out to be only another name of Kuruk§etra :
evidently a Bhargava name.^ The people of India have forgotten this Bhar-
gava synonym : they remember only Kuruk§etra, a name which has struck
deep root in the memory of the people. Even now at every solar eclipse
there is held at Kuruk§etra, a mammoth fair, which attracts hundreds of
thousands of devout pilgrims,'^ hailing from the different comers of India,
who reverently visit the spot hallowed by the blood of their beloved kings of
yore, those shining examples of knighthood and chivalry, who counting their
lives as straw fell fighting, waging a holy war (dharmayuddha), which has
made the Kumfc^etra a dharmaksetra.

In passing, it may be mentioned that this short account of the annihila-
tion of the K§atriyas by the Brahmin Rama Jamadagnya — a very popular
theme, as will be seen later on, with the redactors of our Mahabharata — has
been even amplified in later times by the interpolation of a short dialogue

took place at Samantapancaka is also mentioned in :

This p^assage, which is an abridged version of a dialogue occurring in the
TJrthayatraparvan, a sub-section of the Aranyakaparvan, is found at this
point only in certain Devanagaii MSS. (including those of the “ K '' Version),
and is missing in the Bengali MSS. as well as in the entire Southern recen-
sion, and therefore certainly suspect. We shall have occasion to mention
other similar enlargements of Bhargava anecdotes.

{7} The next reference to the Bhargava Rama occurs in adhy, 58 of
the Adi. and the theme is the same. The chapter, as a matter of fact, des-
cribes the circumstances which led to the incarnation of the gods and god-
desses of the Puraiiiic pantheon on this earth of ours. But the account
begins with an allusion to the great exploit of the Bhargava Rama, his total
extirpation of the bad old kings of yore (1, 58,. 4) :

trihsQptakrtvah, pfthivhh kfiva nihk^atriydm purd |

Jdmadagnyas tapas tepe Mahendre parvatottame || (I)

The first line of this stanza is worthy, of special note. It occurs, with slight
variations, over and over again in our Mahabharata, its exultant note ringing
like a distant echo in the remotest corners and crevices of this huge epos,
which was composed by Kr§na Dvaipayana to spread in this world the fame
of the high-souled P&indavas and of other puissant Ksafriyas (1. 56. 25 f.) :

Kr^na-Dvaipdyanenedam krtmh punyacikirswid 1 |
klrtim prathayatd loke Pdndavdndm mahdtmandm [
anye^dm k^atriyanam ca bhuridravinatejasdm 1 1

When the Bhargava Rama, after making a clean sweep of the K§atriyas,
retired to Mount Mahendra, on the eastern coast of India, to practise auster-
ities, there remained of the warrior caste only the females, and the I^§atriya
race was in imminent danger of becoming totally extinct (Adi. 58). When
the earth was thus bereft of K§atriya manhood, the K§atriya women, casting
aside their pride, approached the Brahmins for offspring. With these
Ki§atriya women cohabited the Brahmins of rigid vows of those times, in
pity for their sad plight. They cohabited with the K§atriya women, not
from passion, only in season, never out of season. Thus thousands of
Kj§atriya women conceived from their intercourse with pious Brahmins.
Their children were the virtuous K^atriyas, who ushered in again the Golden



284 EPIC STUDIES

Age. Thus sprang up a second K§atriya race from the surviving K§atriya
women, owing to their intercourse with ascetic Brahmins. The new genera-
tion, blessed with long life, throve in virtue. And there were again esta-
blished the four castes, having Brahmins at their head (1. 58. 8. 10) ;

Later the Asuras, defeated by the gods and expelled from heaven, in order
to continue their fight for supremacy, took birth in royal families, among
animals and elsewhere on this earth, and so again godless kings were bom
here on the earth. The goddess Earth, oppressed by this vicious and godless
creation, lodged a complaint with Brahma, who, with a view to freeing her
from the tyranny of her oppressors, ordains that the various gods and god-
desses, gandharvas and apsarases incarnate themselves, in different forms
and shapes, to wage war with the Asuras, and annihilate them.

In this legend, which is here skilfully interwoven with the much lauded
exploit of the Bhargava Rama, the Brahmin appears in the role of the
de jacto Creator of the Later K^atriyas. But in a variant version of the
same incident, which occurs in the santi (adhy. 48-49 of the Vulgate) and
which will be discussed in due course, the narrator, Sif-Kj^na himself, while
admitting that there was a general slaughter of the K?atriyas, allows that
some K§atriyas had escaped death at the hands of the Bhargava Rama and,
after his retirement to the forest, emerged from their places of concealment
and resumed sovereignty. But in this prologue to the Adiparvan, however,
VaiSampayana, as we have seen is quite certain that the K§atriyas were totally
annihilated by Rama and the race was entirely regenerated by Brahmins.

Another little digression, adhy. 60, which explains the origin and geneal-
ogy of the different orders of beings, from the gods downwards, contains also
a genealogy of the Bhargavas, the only Brahmanic genealogy, besides that
of the Angirasas^ (a clan closely connected with the Bhrgus) considered by
the epic bards worthy of inclusion in this chapter.

This confused cosmogonic account (1. 60. Iff.) begins with the enumera-
tion of the six mind-bom (mdnasa) sons of Brahma and the eleven sons
of Sthmiu, nan^ly, the eleven Rudras. The six mind-bom sons of Brahma
are : Marici, Angiras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu, which list does
not include Bhrgu.® I>ak§a {9} was bom from the right thumb (angustha)

1 Even the Angirasas are shown scant courtesy. Only one generation of the
family is mentioned : the sons of Angirasas were Bfhaspati, Utathya and Samvarta ;
they had a (nameless) sister.

^ These ax “ mind-bom sons are mentioned again in 1. 59. 10.

of Brahma, and Dak§a's wife from his left thumb. Dafc^a begat fifty
daughters on his wife, of whom he gave away thirteen, in a lot, to Ka§yapa,
son of Martci. Kasyapa’s offspring were the gods and the titans.^ The
list of gods and demi-gods closes with the progeny of Kasyapa (L 60. 39) :

Immediately, after this list of celestials, come Bhygu and his descendants
(1. 60. 40) ;

BrahmOfiu) hjdayam bhittvd niksfio bhagavan BhrguJi \

The close proximity to the gods is perhaps intended to be an indication of
the high position of the Bhrgus in the Precedence List. The genealogy
given here is short and mentions only the well-known descendants of one
branch of the Bhargava clan, the branch made famous by Rama Jamadagnya.
The pedigree begins with Bhrgu, who also was a son of Brahma, being bom
by piercing his heart {hr day a).

But this ancestry of Bhrgu is in conflict with another account found in
the epic (Anusasalia 85 of the Vulgate), according to which Bhrgu was born
from the seed of Prajapati which had fallen in the fire.

The latter account has partial Vedic support, for we read in the Aitareya
Brahmaua (3. 34) that the seed of Prajapati became divided into three
parts, from which were born Aditya, Bhrgu and Ahgiras. On the other
hand, in tlie Pancavimsa Brahmaiia (18. 9. 1),^ the paternity of Bhrgu with
two others is attributed to Varuua. Further in the ^tapatha Brahmaua
(11. 6. 1. 1), Jaiminiya Brahmaoria (1. 42) Taittiriya Upani§ad (1. 3. 1. 1),
TaittirSya Arauyaka (9- 1) also, Bhrgu is said to be the son of Varui:ia ;
from Varuii^a, it is said, he obtained the knowledge of Brahma.

There seems to be partial synthesis of some of these divergent versions
in the confused Anu^sana account cited above, according tot which, while
Mahadeva, in the form of Varm,ia, was performing a sacrifice, Brahmd was
presiding and all the gods and the goddesses were present. Seeing that
assemblage of celestial damsels of exceeding beauty, desire sprang up in the
nund of Brahma, and he had an emission. As soon as the seed came out,
Brahma took it up with the sacrificial ladle and poured it, like a libation
of clarified butter, with the necessary mantras, on tlie burning fire. There-
upon £10} three beings emerged from the sacrificial fire. One arose from
the flames {bhjk) and hence he was called Bhrgu ; another came out of the
burning charcoals {ahgdra) and hence he passed by the name of Ahgiras ;
the third originated from a heap of extinguished coals and was called Kavi.
This tradition we find faintly reflected in a stanza (Adi. 216*), interpolated

Varnnasya kratau jdtah pdvakdd iti nah srutmn 1 1

Here we see that the great seer, “ Bhagavian ” Bhrgu is said to have been
produced by the self-create Lord Brahma during Varuna’s sacrifice from Fire.

However, to return to the pedigree of the Bhfgus given in Adi 60, we
lind the statement that Bhrgu had two sons, Kavi (whose son was Sukra)
and Cyavana. About both Sukra and Cyavana, we hear a great deal in our
Maliabharata. From Cyavana the short pedigree runs as follows : Cya-
vana-Aurva-IJcaka-Jamadagni-Riama. About Kavi and Rdka alone the epic
haS( not very much to narrate, but it is full of the amazing powers and the
wonderful exploits of the remaining Bhargavas mentioned here, for whom
our epic shows great predilection.

Thus we find, only a few chapters later, the epic relating at great length
the well-known story of Yayati (Yayat 3 mpiakhyana, Adi. 71-80), in which
Sukra, the Asura priest, and his haughty and ambitious daughter Devayani
play a prominent role, and which probably contains a solid substratum of
historic truth. Between Yayati and the P^^avas there intervene, according
to the computation of Pargiter, nearly ninety generations. And thus although
the connection of this episode with the main epic story is of most slender char-
acter, it possesses considerable Bhargava interest, which is probably the main
reason why it has been excerpted here from some Pur^ic source.^ The story
of Yayati is introduced in the epic in the following manner.

In adhy, 70, Vaisarhpayana briefly sketches the early history of the
Lunar Dynasty, incidentally mentioning Yayati and his five sons. Jana-
mejaya is not satisfied with this sketchy account and requests Vaisampayana
to relate in detail the story of Yayati, a remote ancestor of the Pi^'cjavas,
“tenth in descent from Prajapati ” {dasmna yah Prajdpateh 1. 71. 1). The
story of Yayati is as follows.

£11} Brhaspati, son of Angiras, was the preceptor of the Devas, the
Bhargava Sukra (Kavya U^as) that of the Asuras. Sukra, a powerful
sorcerer, like all the other Bhargavas, had the knowledge of the secret of
reviving the dead {samjlvam vidyd); not so Brhaspati. The Devas were
therefore handicapped in their wars with the Asuras. So at the instance
of the Devas Brhaspati’ s son Kaca goes to Sukra, who was then the priest
sorcerer of the Asura king ViT^parvan and lives with him as his disciple in
order to obta'in from him a knowledge of the art of reviving the dead.
Sukra*s beautiful daughter Devayani falls headlong in love with Kaca, son
of Brhaspati, and boldly proposes marriage, an honour which Kaca politely
but firmly declines. Subsequently one day when Devayani ahd Sarmi§tha,

It recurs almost verbatim in the Matsya Puraaja (adhy. 25-42).

the daughter of the Asura Vrsaparvan, are having a bath in a neighbour-
ing river, Indra tossed their clothes about, which had been left by the girls
on the river bank, so that Sarmii^thia by mistake took up the dress of Deva-
yanl. There ensues a hefty quarrel between the girls, and Sarmi§tba throws
her rival into a dry well overgrown with grass. And there she remains until
she is seen and pulled out of the well by the gallant king Yayati, whom she
promptly woos and who with the approval of her father, Sukra, marries her.
Previously, as a recompense for her overbearing conduct towards Devayani,
Sarmi^tha, the Asura princess, had become Devayani’s slave. She now ac-
companies Devayani to the capital of Yayati and the three people live in
happiness together for some time. Yayati has been warned beforehand by
the Asura priest Sukra that he must on no account call iSarmi^ha on to his
bed : she was only a slave-girl belonging to Devayani’s entourage. But
Sarmistha prevails upon the soft-hearted and indulgent Yayati, by dint of
importunity and feminine logic to act so that her menstrual period will not
be wasted, for the husband of one's friend is as good as one’s own hus-
band ”. Yayiati moved by her importunities admits the logic of ^armistha’s
requisition and begets on her secretly three sons, while Devayani has only
two. Devayani learns the truth of the whole affair one day by accident,
and goes in a huff to her father, complaining bitterly of the perfidy of her
husband. The enraged Asura priest Sukra curses Yayati that he would
instantly suffer the effects of premature decrepitude, and so it happens.
Sukra relents, however, and adds that, as Yayati had acted from pure
motives he might transfer his premature old age at will to any one who is
willing to take it on in his stead. Accordingly Yayati exchanged his de-
crepitude for the youth of his youngest son, £12} Puru scm of the Asura
princess tSatmi^tha, who was the only one of his five sons willing to take
on his old age and to whom he subsequently handed over his vast kingdom
as a reward for his filial affection.

In this version of the Yayaiti legend, the Bhargavi Devayani has it all
her own way and poor sarmistha, the Asura princess has been thrust in the
background except in the finale, which raises §armi^thia’s youngest son to
the throne and the tables are turned on Devayani, the daughter of the Asura
priest, Sukra. In spite of the Yayatyupakhyana, Indian traidition honours
Sarmii^ha as the pattern of a wife most honoured by her husband ; for in
Kalidasa’s famous drama, when Ka^yapa gives his parting blessing to his
beloved daughter, Sakuntalia, he could think of no better boon than to wish
that she might be like Samii#ia :

** Be thou highly honoured of thy husband, as was Sarmistha of Yayati ! ’

of both the sons of iSamtanu, Citr^gada and Vicitravirya. Satyavati asks
Bhi§ma to marry the young and beautiful widows of his half-brother
VicitravJrya ahd beget children on them for the continuation of the race
of the Kurus, a proposal which Bhi§ma firmly rejects as that would mean
a deliberate breaking of his vow of celibacy. He proposes instead that a
Brahmin be called to officiate {niyoga) and do the job. He cites a prece-
dent for this apaddhmmu. It is po other than the story of the Bhargava
Rama and its sequel. To avenge the death of his father, Bh!§ma relates,
the Bhargava Rama slew Arjuna, the son of Krtavirya, king of the Haiha-
yas. Then he set out on his war chariot to conquer the world. And taking
up his bow, he hurled his mighty magical missiles {astras) and exterminated
the K^atriyas more than once. In days of yore this illustrious descendant
of Bhrgu annihilated the K!?atriyas thrice seven times (1. 98. 3) :

trihsaptakrtvab prthivl kfta nihksatriyd pmd\ (II)

Then from a high sense of duty, the virtuous Brahminsl of the £13} day,
skilled in the Vedas, co-habited with the widows of the Kai^triyas massacred
by the Bhargava Rama and begat on them offsprings and thus revived the
almost extinct race of the K§atriyas. Satyavati should unhesitatingly follow
this excellent precedent and arrange for the revival of the dying race of the
Kurus.

So far we have come across only legends of the past achievements of
the Bhargavas. The first reference to a direct contact between a Bhargava
and one of the epic characters occurs in adhy. 121 of the Adi, In this pseudo-
historical epic, the myth may not be properly regarded as concerned with
events in time. Therefore the Bhargava Rama, who only a few chapters
previously is said to have lived in the interval between the Treta and the
Dvapara Ages is here represented as the teacher {gum) of Acarya Dropa,
who lived in the interval ‘between the Dvapara and the Kali Ages. The pu-
pilship is only symbolical, but the basis of the symbolism is significant.
Acarya Dropa is the guru of the Kauravas and the Plapdvas and of all the
other valiant K^atriyas of the time, and he was also one of the greatest war-
riors on the side of the Kauravas in the Bharata War. But Acarya Dropa
must also have a guru. And who would be more suitable as guru than the
Bhargava Rama, who is the foremost of all weapon-bearers {sarvaiastrabhr-
tdnt verab) ?

Once the symbol has been accepted, it is treated as real, and the myth is
worked out in great detail. Thus we are told that when Dropa had finished
his studies and taken up the duties of a house-holder, he began to feel the
pinch of poverty. He then happened to hear that the Bhargava Rama was
bestowing wealth on Brahmins. No inconsistency or anachronism is fdt, be-

cause Rama is assumed to be “ever-living" {cirajivin). So Drorja presented
himself before the great Bhargava, who was about to start for the forest, and
asked for sofne wealth for himself. Rama ruefully confessed to him that
whatever wealth he at one time possessed he had freely presentai to the
Brahmins ; he had even presented the earth to Ka^yapa, his sacrificing priest.
And now he had nothing left except his mortal body and his weapons and
magical missiles (astras). He asked Droina to cho^ what he wanted.
Drona of course chose the famous missiles with which Rama had conquered
the whole earth. Rama accordingly gave all his £14} weapons to Droina,
instructing him at the same time fully in the science of arms.

This story of Droina and Rama was apparently popular, for we find it
repeated in an abridged form in adhy. 154, it being related there to the
davas by a Brahmin, who was urging them to proceed to the capital of Dru-
pada to attend the sv ay ark vara of Draupadi.

We learn another fragment of Bhargava history from adhy. 169 to 172
of the Adi, the Aurvopakhyana, which is, as a matter of fact, a digression
within a digression.

While the P^dava brothers were proceeding by slow stages to the capi-
tal of king Drupada to attend Draupadi s svayamvara, they are opposed on
the way by Citraratha Afigaraparna, king of the Gandharvas, whom Arjuna
after a brief fight overcomes. Citraratha and Arjuna soon become close
friends. This sudden friendship gives the necessary opportunity to the skil-
ful raconteur to smuggle in some stories. Citraratha, as a matter of fact,
relates to Arjuna a number of interesting but flimsily motivated anecdotes,
which are a pure and unadulterated digression, among them the well-known
story of Vasi^tha. It is related how Vi^vamitra, king of Kanyakubja, tried
to seize Vasi§tha’s sacred cow (kamadhemi) and, failing, turned ascetic and
in the end became a Brahmin ; how king Kalma^pada Saudasa was cursed
by Vasi^tha’s son Sakti (or Saktri) to become a cannibal and how he began
his career as a cannibal by devouring Vasi§tha’s own sons including §akti ; how
Vasii§.tha subsequently freed the king from the effects of the curse. Then
finally to dissuade his enraged grandson Para§ara, son of Sakti, from destroy-
ing the whole creation in his frenzy, Vasi^tha relates to him the story of the
Bhargava Aurva. It will thus be seen that the Bhargava legend is emboxed
within the Vatsi§itha l^end, which is itself an episode of the Caitraratha
section. This story of Aurva is as follows.

Once upon a time there was a king by name Krtavirya of the Haih-
yas, whose family priests were the Bhrgus. On them he bestowed great
wealth. After his death the princes of his family, for some reason or other,
demanded it back. The Bhrgus came out with some of it, but not all. It
then happened that one of the Ki?atriyas, accidentally digging the ground in
the settlement of the Bhrgus, came upon a large store of wealth buried under
{15} ground. Enraged at what they naturally considered deceitful conduct



290


EPIC STUDIES


on the part of the Bhrgus, the K^atriyas used violence to the Bhrgus, and
slew them all indiscriminately. The K^atriyas evai hunted down the women
of the Bhrgusi, and with a view to exterminating the race killed all those that
were pregnant. Pursued by the Ki§atriyas, some of the Bhtgu women took
shelter in the inaccessible fastnesses of the Himalayas. One of these womens
in order to perpetuate the race of the Bhargavas, had concealed her embryo
in her thigh. The K§atriyas, when they came to know of it, pursued her
with the intention of decimating her embryo ; when, lo and behold, the -child
was bom from his mother s thigh, blinding the Haihayas with his lustre.
Bereft of sight, they roamed about in the forest, and, meekly approaching
the faultless Brahmin lady, prostrated themselves before her, begging that
their eyesight might be restored. ‘‘ My good sirs ”, said the Brahmin lady,
“ I have not robbed you of your eyesight, nor am I angry with you. But
this scion of the Bhrgus seems certainly to be angry with you. Your eyesight
has no doubt been destroyed by this high-souled Bhargava, whose wrath has
been kindled by the massacre of his kinsmen. When you took to destroying
even the embryos of the Bhrgu race, the child was held by me concealed in
my thigh for one hundred years. That he may do good to the Bhrgu race,
the entire Veda with its six mgas revealed itself to him when he was still in
the womb. Being enraged at the slaughter of his kinsmen, he desires to kill
you. It is by his divine effulgence that your eyesight has been destroyed. Pray
therefore, my good sirs, to this excellent son of mine, bom of my thigh
{uru) ; and pacified by your humbly prostrating yourself before him, he
may restore your eyesight Thereupon all those Ksatriyas on their bended
knees said to that high-bom child, “Forgive us”, and the high-bom child
forgave them. But that descendant of the Bhargava race did not forget that
outrage and resolved in his mind upon destroying this wicked world. With
that object in view he started performing the most severe austerities. By
the intensity of his austerities he afflicted all the worlds. On learning what
Aurva was doing to avenge the wrong done to them by the Ksatriyas, the
shades of his ancestors came to him and addressed his as follows : [16} “0
Aurva, O child, the prowess of thy fierce austerities has been seen by us.
Control thy anger and forgive the people.” They explain to him that the
Ksatriyas were really not to blame for the slaughter of the Bhrgus ! How
could those puny Ksatriyas ever hope to kill the Bhargavas? That contre-
temps was a little contrivance of the Bhargavas themselves. The fact was
that the Bhargavas were tired of their lives and longed to die, but death dared
not touch them, those sinless effulgent specimens of humanity, and suicide
was a cowardly act and a sin. They had therefore staged that little quarrel
with those foolish and arrogant K§atriyas, so that the Ksatriyas might get en-

raged and kill them, as they did. Of what use could wealth be to those
emancipated souls, whose sole desire was to obtain heaven ? Aurva replies
that they may be all true, but he had made a vow to destroy the world in
order to calm his own anger and he must destroy it, or else he would be
destroyed himself by the fire of his uncontrollable wrath. And so the world
was in imminent danger of being totally destroyed ! But the ancestors of
Aurva show him a way out of the dilemma. They wisely advise him to
fling the fire of his wrath in the waters, which are the primeval source and
support of the world, and Aurva does so. And now, in the shape of horse s
head [hayasiras), his wrath dwells in the ocean, consuming its waters, which
are the world (lokd hy dpomaydh smrtdh. 1. 171. 19).

In the above legend we may notice some of the repeated motives of Bhai -
gava stories. There is first of all the feud with the K§atriyas, which finally
develops into the creation of the figure of the Bhargava Rama, “ the foremost
of all weapon-bearers, ” who single-handed, with the aid of his magical wea-
pons, the astras, conquers the whole earth, annihilating the Ki§atriyas thrice
seven times. Then there is the motif of the opportune birth of a miraculous
child, whose effulgent lustre either blinds the oppressor (as here) or con-
sumes him (as in the case of Cyavana) . There is, lastly, the appearance of
the shades of the ancestors, who step in to stop the carnage either contemplat-
ed (as here) or actually perpetrated (as in the case of Rama), to avenge
some private wrong done with reference to the family.

£17} Sabhaparvan

The short Sabha, which is a compact little book with 81 chapters and
about 2700 stanzas, (in the Vulgate), begins with the Erection of the Darbar
Hall and ends with the Second Gambling Match. Here the story marches
forward by rapid strides, consisting as it does mainly of spirited dialogue and
dramatic action. The digressions are few and far between, and of updkhyd-
nos as such there are none. The real important digressions, which occur early
in the beginning, are two : firstly,, the somewhat lengthy and imaginative
descriptions {dkhydnas) by Narada of the halls of the celestials Indra, Yama,
Varuoa, Kubera, and Brahma, preceded by a short Niti tractate (adhy. 5-12) ;
and, secondly, the previous history of Jarasaihdha, narrated by Ki^a (adhy.
17-19) . Consequently, in this parvan, the Bhargava material is extremely
scanty.

The Bhargavas are nevertheless briefly mentioned several times. Thus,
naturally, many of the Bhargavas, to wit, Blrrgu, Markaodeya, Rama, Ja-
madagnya, are several times mentioned as being present, along with other
famous sages and seers of the past, in the halls of the celestials mentioned
above, as also as a matter of course in the newly erected hall of Yudhi^thira.
In adhy. 8, Rama has been placed by mistake among the royal sages (rd-
jar^is). They are likewise present at the coronation of Yudhi§thira. These



292


EPIC STUDIES


Static figures are like tnural decorations, and of no special interest to us.
We shall therefore ignore them.

Rama’s extermination of the K§atriyas, which is really never quite for-
gotten by our bards, is mentioned in adhy. 14. KrsDa prefaces his long
reply to Yudhi§thira regarding the prerequisites of the Rajasuya sacrifice by
pointing out, quite irrelevantly, that the contemporary K^atriyas were far in-
ferior to that old race of Eu^triyas that was exterminated by the Bhargava
Rama (B. 2. 14. 2) :

Jdmadagnyena Rdmena k§atram yad avasesitam |
tasmdd <w<xrajmh loke yad idani k^atrasamjnitam 1|

It was mentioned above that the high esteem in which our epic bards
held Rama Jamadagnya had led to his being represented as the teacher of
Acarya Drona in the science of arms. The same ideology is responsible for
the sedulously fostered belief that Rama was the teacher of Bhi§ma also, an
idea which is taken hold of £18} and further developed in that late addition
to the Udyoga,, the Amba episode (Ambopakhyana). Rama is represented as
standing in the same relation to Kama, the protege and ally of Ehiryodhana.
So, in his denunciation of Kr§na, Sisupala mentions Karna’s pupilship under
Rama as one of Karna’s qualifications entitling him to receive the argha
(B. 2, 37. 15 f.) :

This book is a veritable thesaurqs of ancient Brahmanic myths and le-
gends. We accordingly find that a fair amount of Bhargava material has
been incorporated in it. We further find that one Bhargava takes a con-
siderable share in the story-telling that is done here.

The first important deference to the Bh^gus is in the Tirthayatra sec-
tion. The list of fiyikas given in adhy. 82 ff (of the Vulgate) is said to
have been first communicated^ by the sage Pulastya to Bhji^ma and then re-
peated by Narada to Yudhisthira. It is in reality a material compendium
of tirthas, which gives, in the space of a stanza or two, the necessary details
about the particular tirtha : the name of the tirtha, the ritual acts to be done
there, and finally the merit {purj^ya) accruing from these acts. Thus, for
example we read (B. 3. 83. 13 ff.):

‘‘O king, going to iSalukin! and bathing in the Dasasvamedha, the pil-
grim obtains the merit of performing 10 asvamedha sacrifices. — Then going to
Saipadevi, that excellent tirtha of the Nagas, one obtains the merit of per-
forming 1 agnktoma sacrifice and goes to the world of the Nagas.-— One
should then proceed, O virtuous man, to (the shrine of) Tarantuka, the gate-
keeper. Staying there only for one night, one obtains the merit of giving

293


away 1000 kine. — Then going to the Pahcanada, with regulated diet and sub-
dued soul, and bathing in the Kotitlrtha, one obtains the merit of perform-
ing 1 asvamedhu sacrifice. Going to the tirtha of the Asvins, a man is bom
handsome (in a future birth, of course). — One should then go, O virtuous
man, to the excellent £19} tirtha called Varaha, where Vi§iiu in times of yore
appeared in the form of a boar. Bathing there, O foremo^ of men, one
obtains the merit of performing 1 agnistoma sacrifice. — O king of kings, one
should then visit Somatirtha, situated in Jayanti. Bathing in it, one obtains
the merit of performing 1 rdjasuya sacrifice. — Bathing in Ekaharhsa, one ob-
tains the merit of giving away 1000 kine.-~0 ruler of men, going to the
Krtasauca, the pilgrim becomes purified, and obtains the merit of perform-
ing 1 pundartka sacrifice. — Then going to Munjavata, the place sacred to
Sthanu, and fasting for one night, one acquires the position of gdnapatya
And so on and so forth.

Only very rarely is this dreary enumeration intermpted by a brief ac-
count of some myth or legend connected with the place of pilgrimage in
question. Now we find embedded in this list the legend connected with the
Ramahradas (B. 3. 33. 26 ff.), which appears to have considerably roused
the interest of the compiler and to which he has devoted not less than 32
lines. The story is of course no other than that of the extirpation of the
Ksatriya race by the Bhargava Rama, of which this is already the jourth
repetition in some form or other. The story is as follows.

The greatly effulgent and heroic Rama, after exterminating the K^atri-
yas with great valour, formed five lakes filled with the blood of the slaughter-
ed warriors. And he offered that blood as oblation to his forefathers, who
were most gratified by this supreme act of filial piety. The shades of these
ancestors appeared before him and addressed him as follows : “ O Rama, O
Rama, O fortunate one ! We are pleased, O Bhargava, with thy filial piety
and with thy great valour.. Ask for a boon, O greatly effulgent one. What
dost thou wish to have ? Having been thus addressed by his ancestors,
Rama, that foremost of smiters {Rdmah pruharatdm varah B. 3. 83. 31),
thus spoke with joined hands to his ancestors : “ If you are pleased with me
and if I have deserved your favour then by your grace I desire that I may
again derive pleasure in asceticism. By your power, may I be freed
from the sin I have incurred by killing these K^atriyas in a fit of
wrath. Also may these sanguinary lakes become holy places of pilgrimage
celebrated throughout the world . Hearing these righteous words of Rama,
his ancestors were highly pleased, £20} and filled with joy they thus replied
to Rama : “ Let thy austerities prosper, especially by virtue of thy filial piety.
Forsooth thou hast exterminated the K§atriyas in a fit of wrath, but thou
art already freed from that sin, for they have fallen owing to their own mis-
deeds. These lakes of thine shall without doubt become places of pilgrimage.
He who will bathe in these lakes and offer here oblations to his ancestors will



294


EPIC STUDIES


please his manes and they will gratify all his heart’s desire, and lead him
to the eternal celestial regions”. Having granted these boons to Rama and
affectionately taken leave of him, the shades became invisible. It was thus
that the bloody lakes of that illustrious descendant of Bhrgu became sacred
places of pilgrimage. — Leading the life of a student of the sacred lore and
observing sacred vows, if a person bathes in the Lakes of Rama (Ramahra*
da) and worships Rama, he will obtain much gold.

The reader will easily recognize this as the story which was briefly re-
lated already in connection with Samantapaflcaka. In fact Ramahrada ap-
pears to be only another name of Samantapancaka, one of the Urthas explicit-
ly mentioned as having been visited by the Suta (that is, the putative narrator
of the Mahabharata), before he came to Saunaka’s sacrifice. It will be re-
called that some information was asked then about Samantapancaka in adhy.
2 of the Adi, and in that connection this story was briefly narrated by the
Suta to the sages of the Naimi^a Forest. There the story was originally
summarized in four stanzas, but some subsequent reviser, apparently not
satisfied with such a cursory allusion to this epoch-making feat of Rama, had
interpolated at that place the dialogue between Rama and his ancestors
(compressed into eight lines) made up mostly of bits and pieces of verses
borrowed from the present context, and like all interpolations proving itself
to be somewhat of a bad fit.

A few chapters later, we have a strange story of a conflict between two
different avataras of the same god, Visnu, between the Jamadagnya Rama
and the Da^rathi Rama, told in connection with a Bhrgutirtha, ” celebrated
in the three worlds, which Yudhi§thira and his party are said to have visited
(B. 3. 99. 34 ff). Once upon a time, the story goes, Rama Jamadagnya went
to Ayodhya to meet Rama Dasarathi and to test his strength. {21} Rama
D. was sent by his father to the boundary of his kingdom to receive Rama
J. hospitably, but was flagrantly insulted by the latter. Rama D. nevertheless
bends the bow given to him by Rama J. to test his strength and shoots an
arrow which convulses the whole world, astounding Rama J. Rama D. further
confounds Rama J. completely by showing him his cosmic form (visvmupa),
made popular by the Gita (adhy. 11), and rebukes him for his( overweening
conduct. Abashed, Rama J. returns to Mount Mahendra, having lost his
lustre {tejm), which he regains later at some tlrtha or other. Yudhi^thira is
asked to baithe in the same tlrtha that he might regain the lustre he had lost
in his conflict with Duryodhana.

This grotesque story, composed probably with the object of glorifying
the K§atriya Rama at the cost of the Brahmin Rama, must be quite a modem
interpolatiooi in the Mahabharata. Contextually it is an obvious mis-
fit, being incongmously wedged in between two halves of the Agastya legend,
with which it has absolutely no connection. Not only is this bizarre story
contextually a mi^t, it is a very poor piece of composition, and it strikes



EPIC STUDIES VI


295


moreover a discordant note, involving disrespect towards the Bhargava Rama,
who in our epic is otherwise throughout held up for air admirations as the^
foremost of weapon-bearers and fighters. Fortunately we are not left to
deduce the spuriousness of this passage merely from intrinsic arguments,
which are apt to be discredited ; for, the passage is missing entirely in the
Southern recension, an omission supported by the Kasmirl version and even
by some ancient Devanagari MSS. The story, which is narrated at some
length in the Ramayatna, is not even alluded to in the Ramopakhyana of our
epic and belongs evidently to a different complex of legends, quite inharmo-
nious with the Mahabharata context. It appears to have been smuggled into
the capacious folds of the Arajiyakaparvan in quite recent times by some
well-meaning but ignorant Northern interpolator anxious to vindicate the
claim of the epic to be a complete encyclopaedia of the Hindu legendary lore.^

But the next chapter (100) again contains a Bhargava story, the legend
of Dadhica. Lomasa relates how the Kalakeyas under the leadership of
Vrtra persecuted the celestials, who betook them-{22}-selves to Brahma ask-
ing for his protection. The latter advises them to go to the (Bhargava) Da-
dhica and ask for his bones. The sage magnanimously gives up his body
for the good of the three worlds. The celestials took the bones of Dadhica
to Visvalcarman, the architect of the gods, who fashioned out of his tones
the thunderbolt, with which Indra vanquished the enemies of the gods. The
story is repeated in the account of the pilgrimage of Baladeva (sSalya 51 in
the Vulgate), where it is said of Dadhica that he was the strongest of all
creatures, tall as the Himalayas and that Indra was always mightily afraid
of him on account of his lustre.

Yet again, a few chapters later, the arrival of Yudhisthira and his party
at Mount Mahendra, the headquarters of Rama, now a samnydsin, affords
a welcome opportunity to the bard for the presentation of a full-length por-
trait of the hero of the Bhargavas, Rama, son of Jamadagni (Arainyaka 115-
117 in the Vulgate) .

The Pandavas bathe at the mouth of the Ganges and proceed to the river
Vaitaraiii in Kalinga, where the altar of Kasyapa is. They rest on Mount
Mahendra and hear there from Akrtavrana, a disciple of the Bhargava Rama,
the well-known story of Rama, which may be summarized as follows.

Gadhi, king of Kanyakubja, had retired to the forest to practise reli-
gious austerities. There a most beautiful daughter was tom to him, Satya-
vati, whom the Bhargava Rcika wooed. Gadhi perhaps did not re-
lish his suit and tried to evade it by demanding a present of
a thousand peculiarly coloured horses, but Rcika supplied them
and gained her. Then a Bhrgu (perhaps, Aurva is meant), who
was a great sorcerer, visits the newly married couple and gives his young

daughter-in-law the boon that she would give birth to a gifted son, and so
would her mother. To fortify the boon, he prescribes that she should em-
brace an udumbara tree, her mother an asvattha, and both should partake of
different dishes of some special earn prepared by him with powerful incanta-
tions and endowed with magical potency. These good ladies go and ex-
change the trees as well as the dishes of earn which were apportioned to them
by the great sage, with the result that the daughter was about to give birtli
to a Brahmin son with K§atriyan qualities and the mother a K^atriya son
with {23} Brahmanic qualities. But the Bhrgu, who comes to know of this
interchange by occult means, comes rushing to the hermitage and tells his
daughter-in-law what was going to happen. Moved by her entreaties, he gives
a further boon to the young woman who had really been deceived by her mo-
ther, postponing the action of the potent charm. Thus her son Jamadagni
was saved from the taint of K)§atriyahood, which ultimately fell upon her
grandson Rama, who turned out to be, as prophesied, a revengeful and blood-
thirsty warrior, perpetrator of cruel and sanguinary deeds. Jamadagni,
though a peaceful Brahmin who excelled in the study of the Vedas, as de-
sired by his mother, was not without martial equipment, for “the entire
science of arms with the four kinds of magical missiles spontaneously came
to him, who rivalled the sun in lustre, without any instruction from any-
body” (B. 3. 115. 45). Jamadagni married Renuka, daughter of king Pra-
senajit. She gave birth to five sons : Rumanvat, Suseina, Vasu, Visvavasu,
and last but not least Rama, The family lived happily for some time. Then
one day when Reriuka of rigid vows happened to see Citraratha, the hand-
some king of Marttikavataka, sporting in water with his numerous wives,
her fortitude forsook her and she felt the pangs of desire. When she return-
ed to the hermitage, Jamadagni noticed her pollution and guessed her secret.
In a fit of rage he called in turn upon each of his sons to kill their unchaste
mother. Four of them refused to do the atrocious deed and were cursed
by the angry and disappointed father for their disobedience. Then came the
last of all that “ slayer of hostile heroes, ” Rama Jiamadagnya. A military
type, accustomed to receive and obey orders, Rama, when sternly command-
ed by his father to slay his mother, took his axe and without hesitation
chopped off his mother’s head ! Jamadagni, mightily pleased with the ins-
tant obedience of his son, granted Rama several boons, among thetn the boon
that the mother whom Rama had decapitated might be restored to life.
And the family lived again happily for some time. Then one day Arjuna
Kartavirya Sahasrab^u came to the hermitage and was hospitably received
by the Bhargavas. The ungrateful king, intoxicated with the pride of power,
not heeding the hospitality, seized and carried off by force from the hermit-
age the calf of the sacred cow of the sage (a variant of the kamadhem motif
of the Vasii^tfia-{24}-Vi4vSmitra legend), and spitefully broke the big tree
in the hermitage grounds. This was the beginning of a terrible feud. Rama

first slew the arrogant Arjuna Kartavirya, and Arjuna's sons then slew the
unresisting Jamadagni. Then Rama slaughtered the sons of Arjuna K. and
finally destroyed all K§atriyas off the earth thrice seven times and made five
pools of blood in Samantapancaka (B. 3. 117. 9) ;

triljLsaptakTtvah prthivim krtvd ni^k^atriydm prabhuh 1
Samontapancake pane a cakdra rudhirahraddn \\ (III)

Standing in the middle of these pools of blood — as has already been nar-
rated several times above — Riama offered oblations to the manes until at
last his ancestor R.lcka appeared and stopped him. Rama then performed
a great sacrifice to gratify Indra, in which he bestowed the earth upon Kas-
yapa, his priest. Then this annihilator of the Ksatriya race was at last satis-
fied and retired to Mount Mahendra, engaging himself in austerities of a
rather severe type. “ Thus did hostility arise between Rama and K§atriyas
of this earth, and the entire earth was conquered by Rama of immeasurable
lustre” (B. 3. 117. 15). It is then narrated that the Bhiargava Rama
appeared there in person on Mount Mahendra to meet the Piaiitjavas. He
was duly received and honoured by Yudhi§thira and his party, and he
honoured them in turn.

This account has been amplified in later times — like several other Bhar-
gava episodes — by the addition of a passage of 23 lines (B. 3. 115. 9-19),
which is prefixed to it and which is chiefly of interest on account of the vague
suggestion it contains to the effect that Bhiargava Rama was an avatdra of
Vi§j>u. This interpolation begins with the previous history of Arjuna Karta-
virya, king of Haihayas. He is represented here as a worshipper of DattS.-
treya, by whose favour he had obtained a golden vimdna and a wonderful
chariot. Intoxicated with the pride of power, Arjuna Kartavirya insulted
Indra, trampled upon the sages and even upon the celestials, and persecuted
all creatures. Thereupon the celestials and the sages met together and went
in a body to Vi^aju to ask for his protection. Then the exalted god (Vi§iiu)
held a consultation with Indra. The god of gods (Indra) told Vwu what
had to be done. Thereupon the exalted go4, promising to do the needful,
went to Badan, his £25} favourite retreat. — Here the introduction suddenly
breaks off, and the story narrated about Gadhi and Rcika begins (B. 3. 115-
20). The suggestion probably is that at the consultation between Indra
and Vi§!iTiu it was decided that Vi§iiu should incarnate himself on the earth
as the son of Jamadagni, as Riama Jamadagnya, who should, in the fulness
of time, slay Arjuna Kartavirya, but that is left unsaid. The passage is
missing in the entire Southern recension and in some Northern manuscripts
including those of the Kasmiii version. There can therefore be no doubt
about its being a comparatively recent interpolation.

As already remarked above, Rama Jamadagnya and the other BhSrgavas
such as Cyavana, IJdka and so on are generally used as static figures, along
with other ancient sages like Niarada, in the description of largely attended

and important meetings and state functions, and such treatment of these
characters is quite intelligible, if not natural. But the Bhargavas — and es-
pecially the Bhargava Rama — are accorded a somewhat different treatment ;
they are represented as taking part in the action more definitely and more
frequently. We have seen that the Bhargava Rama is said to have given all
his astras to Dro|na. He is also said to have taught Bhli^ma and Karpa.
Here he is represented as having shown himself to the P^davas, as a special
favour. In another context Rama is said to have fought with Bhl^ma,, a fight
which lasted for twenty-three days but was absolutely barren of any conse-
quence. Elsewhere also we shall find Rama and some of other Bhargavas re-
presented as taking some innocuous part in the action, which in no way
affects the course of events but which serves to establish and maintain con-
tact between the Bhargavas and the epic characters.

The above story of Rama, which is miscalled the Kartaviryopakhyana,
ends at adhy. 117 of the Vulgate. At adhy. 122, we have another Bhargava
story, which covers adhy. 122-124 and about half of adhy. 125 : the story
of the great wizard Cyavana, son of Bhrgu.

The Pl^davas reach the Payo^iii and the Narmada rivers and hear from
Lomasa the story {updkhydna) of Cyavana : how he demanded in marriage
a young princess, by name Sukanya, who £26} had innocently and unwit-
tingly blinded him ; how he recovered his sight by the grace of the Asvins
and how he gave them on that account that Soma libation, paralyzing the
arm of Indra, who would have prevented it. The story runs thus.

Cyavana, son of Bhrgu, practised austerities in a forest so long that an
ant-hill was formed round him. There came one day to that place king Siar-
yati, acompanied by his daughter Sukanya, with beautiful eyebrows and
tapering thighs. The sage imprisoned within the ant-hill gazed longingly at
the youthful princess, clad in a single garment ai>d adorned with costly orna-
ments, and addressed some words to her which sihe did not hear. Sukanya
saw, however, the gleaming eyes of the sage, engaged in self-mortification in
the ant-hill, and mistaking them for a species of glow-worm, in youthful
heedlessness, pierced the eyes of the sage with a thorn. Little did she think
of the dire consequences of her childish act. For through the anger of the
offended sage, smarting with the pain thoughtlessly inflicted on him by the
heedless princess, the king’s entire army suffered suddenly from a complete
stoppage of urine and excreta. The bewildered king inquired about the cause
of this strange mishap, but none of his soldiers and companions could en-
lighten him. The occurrence remained a mystery until the guilty princess
confessed her misdemeanour. ;8aryiati forthwith set out to pacify the irate
sage. The sage would relent only if the mischievous but fascinating princess
is given to him in marriage. Without reflecting, the king agreed to bestow
his beautiful daughter on the high-souled Cyavana and returned to his own
city. Some time later the Asvins saw the faultless Sukanya bathing in the

lake adjoining the hermitage of the sage. They also were smitten by her
ravishing beauty and asked her to accept one of them for her husband instead
of the blind old sage. As she would not consent, they propose that they would
rejuvenate Cyavana, and then she should choose. With the permission of
her husband she consents to the second proposal. Cyavana had to dip into
the waters of the lake, into the primordial dement,, the womb of all creation,
along with the A^ins (Fountain of Youth motif ).^ The three of £27} them
came out of the water, all looking exactly alike. Here is a diletnma (Nala-
Damayanti motif). By virtue of her unswerving loyalty to her husband,
Sukanya is however able to choose the right man. In gratefulness for the
gift of youth and beauty, Cyavana promises the Asvins a draught of the
Soma juice during a regular Sacrifice. Soon afterwards, saryiati comes to visit
his son-in-law Cyavana and the latter arranges a great sacrifice for isaryati,
at which he offers the first draught of Soma to the Asvins, who used to be
altogether excluded on these festive occasions on account of their being
medicine-men. Indra tries to stop the sacrilegious act ; but as Cyavana will
not heed, Indra then attempts to hurl the thunderbolt at him. But Cyavana
was toc ^quick for him. Instantly Cyavana paralyzed Indra’s arm and brought
him to his knees. At the same time the great sorcerer created by his magic
a terrible demon {kjtya) called Mada (Intoxication). When Mada rushes
towards Indra to slay him, Indra grants the wish of Cyavana, who triumph-
antly continues the sacrifice and gives the Asvins, the promised libation of
Soma. Since that time the Asvins participate regularly in the sacrificial
offerings on a basis of equality with the other gods. Indra at the same time
apologizes and explains that he had opposed Cyavana merely to spread the
fame of Cyavana and his father-in-law !§aryati throughout the world : a
significant and prophetic utterance.

Bhrgu, the father of Cyavana, had only cursed Agni, a minor god, in
fact, merely the “ mouth ” of the gods, to be sarvabhaksa, devourer of all
things, good and bad (1. 6, 13). Cyavana did even better. He thoroughly
humbled Indra, the king of gods, who had to submit to the will of Cyavana.

In the next chapter again we have a passing allusion to a Bhargava,
who remains unnamed. The background is a Bhargava hermitage, though
the main actors are not Bhrgus, The pious Yuvaniasva Saudyumni is
practising austerities for the sake of progeny. One night he became very
thirsty. Searching for water, he enters the hermitage of the Bhargava who
was engaged in performing some magical rites in order to make Yuvanasva’s
queen give birth to a son. This sorcerer had actually prepared a potion, en-
dov/ed with magical efficacy, for administering it to the queen and kept the
jar containing the dose in al corner* of the £28} hermitage. The thirsty king
found it, and, not knowing that the water was charmed and intended in fact

given by H. Zimmer in his Muyu, Der indische Mythos (Stuttgart 1936), pp. 42 ff.

for the queen, drained the potion to the dregs. Here was a mess. But the
potion prepared by a Bhrgu is infallible in its effect. Whoever drinks it must
give birth to a son. Cotislequently the king became himself pregnant, and a
son, Mandhatr, was bom to him, ripping open his left side, but owing to some
propitiatory rites performed by the Bhrgu, Yuvana^va himself escaped unhurt.

It is interesting to compare this version of the story of M^dhiatr with
the one which occurs in the Droioaparvan (adhy. 62 of the Vulgate). There
we are told that once upon a time king Yuvanasva, when out hunting, became
thirsty, and his steed was exhausted. Seeing at a distance a curl of smoke,
the monarch guided by it reached a sacrificial enclosure and found there
some sacrificial butter (djya), which he greedily swallowed. Thereupon the
king became pregnant and was delivered of a son (Mandhatr) by the Asvins.
The rest of the story is nearly the same.

In this version, king Yuvanasva was not practising austerities for secur-
ing the birth of a son, but had gone out hunting. Nor did he partake of the
magical preparation at night in the dark, but presumably in full daylight,
when the slmoke from the sacred hearth could yet be seen by him. The second
version moreover makes no mention of any Bhrgu, playing the role of the
officiating priest and saviour of Yuvanasva, like the first, which is an im-
portant discrepancy. The second story is sketchy and lacking in definition,
and appears to Be the older version. In the first the details are filled out,
by adding a Bhrgu as an officiating priest and generally making the picture
more vivid and realistic.

The next Bhargava of importance we meet with in the Aranyaka is the
sage Markandeya, whose discourses on the most divers topics extend over
51 Chapters (182-232) in the Vulgate, containing about 2200 stanzas (Mar-
kandeya-samasya), which he delivers for the delectation and edification of
the Pandavas. This is not his first visit to the Pandavas by any means. For
early in the beginning of their exile, when the Pandavas had settled in the
Dvaitavana Forest, Markaaideya had paid a flying visit {29} to them (adhy.
25). He turns up again, as a matter of fact, also towards the end of their
exile, without notice or warning, to console Yudhi§thira and relates to him
the Ramopakhyana, the popular story of Rama and Sta, as well as the
Savitryupakhyana, that immortal story of a wife's splendid devotion. These
two updkhydnas, narrated by Markaaideya, together comprise about 1060
stanzas. Thus the Miarkair?^^eya-sianilasya together with the two latter upa^
khyanas comprise 3260 stanzas, which is nearly one fourth of the entire
extent of this extensive parvan.

Markan^eya was one of the cirajivins : eternally youthful though many
thousand years old. How he was exactly connected with the two wdl-known
Bhrgu families of our Mahabharata (Bhrgu-Cyavana-Rama and Bhrgu—
Cyavana-Sunaka) is not exactly known ; but that he was a Bhargava is be-
yond doubt. He is referred to as Bhmgam in B. 3. 183. 60 ; 189. 97 ;

190. 2. 13. 22. 15 : as \BMrgava-sattama in B. 3. 201. 7 ; 217. 5 : as Bhr-
                gu-nandana in B. 3. 205. 4 : as Bhrgukula^irestha in B. 3. 205. 15. More-
                over MarkaiQda is' explicitly declared to be a gotra founder of the Bhtgu clan
                in the Matsya Parana (195. 20).

Some of the subjects of Markand^ya’s discourses to the Pao^avas are
the following : great power of Brahmins ; merit of benevolence to Brahmins ;
wife’s duty to her husband ; and different forms of Agni. He relates, among
others, stories of Manu, Yayati, Vrsadarbha, 'Sibi, Indradyumna (father of
Janaka), Kuvalasva and of Skanda Karttikeya. He is also responsible for
the famous story of the Righteous Hunter (dharma^vyddha) of Mithila.
Besides these, there is, as is well known, a whole Parana named after him,
the Markaipdeya Purana.

The most interesting of Markandeya's stories, however, is how he ac-
tually witnessed the act of creation and dissolution in progress. We have
here in fact in Markandeya a Brahmanic counterpart of the K^triya Manu,
that distant cousin of the Semitic Noah with his ark, seeds and so on.

The legend of Manu, like that of Noah, is a childish story. According
to this legend (Matsyopakhyana, also related by the same sage Mi^kaindeya,
Arainyaka 187 in the Vulgate), Manu, son of Vivasvat, while saying his
usual prayers on the bank of a river, sees a tiny little fish, which asks the sage
to protect it. £30} Manu rears the fish in a small earthem vessel, which the
fish soon outgrows. The fi^ keeps on growing larger and larger. Manu
places the fish successively in a tank, in the river Ganges, and in the ocean.
Before parting from Manu, the fish warns him of the impending catastrophe
and advises him to build an ark and keep carefully a store of seeds of all
kinds. When the deluge comes, Manu gets into the ark with the Seven Sages.
The ark is towed by the horned fish on the ocean, which during the deluge
flooded everything. The ship, “ like a drunken wench ”, staggered from side
to side on the bosom of the agitated ocean . In the end the ship is fastened on
to the peak of the Himalayas, called Naubandhana, which is projecting out of
the water. When the flood subsides, Manu quietly gets out of the ark and,
as he has all the necessary seeds with himself in the ark, there would be no
difficulty in creating the world anew. Before parting again from Manu and
the Seven Sages, the Fish saysi, ” I am Brahma, the lord of creatures. None
is greater than I. In the form of a fish I have saved you all from this pe-
ril. Manu will create all beings : gods, asuras and human beings, the mobile
and the immobile creation. ”

This story, which appears to belong to a different complex of m 3 dhs and
does not at all fit well in the Mahiabharata cycle, is, as has been surmised,
probably of Semitic origin.*^ If Manu creates all beings, Brahma is thrown

out of employment. The Purauic theory of creation is that there is a deluge ;

nothing remains of the universe except Vi§iiu-Narayaiiia, reclining on tlie

coils of the Eternal Serpent (iSe^a-Ananta) floating on the waters. Then
out of Narayana’s navel emerges Brahma, seated on a lotusi, tlie creative as-
pect of the deity. From Brahma are born his mind-bom sons {manasa-pu-
iras). Then other beings, male and female, emerge from his heart, breast,
thumbs and so on. These are the Prajapatis. They propagate this world
of oursi. The process is repeated at each dissolution : it is an eternal recur-
rence. In this complex there is clearly no roomi for the Semitic legend,

which would imply a parallel creation by Manu, a state of things

which is not at all what is intended by the legend. Since a £31} vaJriant
version of this legend is found even in the Satapatha Brahmaaja (1. 8. 1 ),
it should seem that the Semitic legend was introduced into India at a fairly
early date but has remained unassimilated. Its exotic character, however,
appears to me to be clearly betrayed by the phalasruti at the end of the chap-
ter, an addition which accompanies all late accretions to the Great Epic (B.
3. 187. 58 emended) :

ya idam sr^ydn nityam Memos caritam dditah |

sa sukhi sarvasiddhdrthah svargalokam iydn narah 1 1
The Indian Noah is a man of a very different character. He requires
neither boat nor homed fish to save him ; nor does he keep a store of
seeds with himself. The man who could live through the dissolution of the
world can only be a perfect Yogi ; and a perfect Yogi is deathless. “ There
is none equal to you in years save Brahma Paramesthin,” says Yudhistbira
to the Bhargava Markaiu^cya. But he requires neither food nor drink to live.
He can walk on water as easily as on land. So when the world was over-
whelmed with floods and the creation was gradually submerged, Markaijidoya
found himself alone, walking on the waters of the oceani. After some time
Markaindcya, being hunmn after all, begins to feel a little tired and lonely,
tramping about all by himself on the surface of the endless ocean. He also
felt inexpressibly sad at that awful destruction. Then all of a sudden he
noticed a little child resting on the extended branch of a huge banyan tree
{nyagrodha). Markaiijdeya could not at all imagine how that little helpless
child could have survived all that cataclysmal devastation, and he kept ponder-
ing over that matter, standing near the child. Seeing his confusion, the
child softly told him to go into his body and rest there, and the child opened
its little mouth and drew him gently inside. And, lo and behold, inside the
child he found the world whose destmction he had seen with his own eyes.
The sun, the moon and the stars, all the oceans, seas and rivers of the world,
all the men, women and children whom he had known, all animals, gods and
demons, — ^they were all there, inside the little stomach of that wonderful little
child. He wandered about inside for hundreds of years and still he could not
find the end of it all, when he suddenly found £32} himself outside the child,

blown out by his gentle exhalation. Then the child spoke to the sage, and
then it suddenly dawned on Markaodeya who the Child was. He sees and
recognizes God.^

As this Brahmin Noah had no need for the ark, he had no need for
any seeds. The ^eeds are there permanently. There had been in fact no
destruction at all : that destruction was an illusion. There was only an in-
volution : the world had been only withdrawn into the interior of God. Crea-
tion, moreover, was not Miarkajideya's concern : it was the business of
Brahmia. Like the seed which has been well planted, the universe will grow
of itself, putting forth in due time blossoms and fruits and other seeds. Mar-
kaitjd^ya, the Yogi, is interested only in knowing and understanding things.
He had seen God, but that is not sufficient for him. He wants to know God,
know about His nature and character. His Maya, that Maya which had not
been understood even by the gods themselves (B. 3. 188. 135) :

Jnatum icchami deva tvdm mdydm caitdm tavottamdm |

The divine Child declares itself to be Narayana,, the indestructible source
of the world, and reveals to Markandeya His real nature and character.

The Bhargava Markaindeya is, according to this account, the only man
who had survived the last deluge, witnessed the act of dissolution and crea-
tion in progress, stood in his own person face to face with Narayana in the
utter solitude of total annihilation, but it is nowhere made clear why Markan-
deya was singled out for this unique honour : it is an unmotivated theme.
It is left to us to infer that the Bhargava Markandeya is the only perfect
Yogi that ever lived.

A little later, as already mentioned, Markandeya relates to the PSijda'-
vas the famous Ramopakhyana (Aranyaka 273-292 in the Vulgate), an
abridgement of the Rama story in about 750 stanzas. The occasion for re-
lating the story arises in the following way.

Jayadratha, a near relative of the Kurus and the Ptandavas tries to carry
off Draupadi, but is defeated and captured, and ultimately pardoned and re-
leased. Yudhi§thira mourns his fate £33} and asks Markaindeya, who seems
to be rather abruptly introduced for the purpose of the story, if there is any
mortal more unfortunate than himself. Thereupon Markaindeya relates the
^ory of the Dasarathi Riarna. Now the entire story of the attempted rape
of Ehaupadi by Jayadratha is so ill conceived and unconvincing that it ap-
pears to have been invented solely for the purpose of introducing a sum-
mary of the Riamayana. Who could be now a better narrator of the story
of Rama than the Bhargava Markaipdeya, age-old and yet eternally young,
the only man who had witnessed the happenings in this world in all the dif-
ferent ages, witnessed even the dissolution and creation of the world?


^ An illuminating commentary on a different version of this same myth is
given by H. Zimmer, Maya, Der indische Mythos, pp. 52 ff.

EPIC STUDIES


After hearing the story of Rama, Yudhi^thira, the “dummy” of the
bard., says that he did not grieve so much on his own or his brotiiers’ ac-
count as he did on account of the daughter of Drupada ; and then asks Mar-
kaijd^ya if he had ever seen or heard of a woman as devoted to her husband
as Draupadi. To console Yudhi^thira, Markandeya then relates the well-
known story {updkhyana) of Savitri, who rescues her husband from death by
the insistent importunity of her pleading, by her deep feminine intuition
and by her unflinching devotion to her husband (Arainyaka 293-299 in the
Vulgate). And that is the last episode of the Aranyaka narrated by the
Bhargava Markandeya and in fact the last episode of this parvan in which a
Bhargava is concerned.

Virataparvan

In the short Virataparvan, as is in the Sabha, the narrative is plain and
straightforward, unembellished by any episodic enlargement, and the story
marches rapidly forward. This book contains consequently no updkhydnas
and there is no room for any Bhargava digression. The references to the
Bhiargavas are few and far between, and they are incidental allusions to the
greatness or heroism of the Bhargavas. One of these may be adduced for
the purpose of illustration. Addressing Duryodhana, BhJ§ma asks : “ Who is
superior to Drona except Rama, the son of Jamadagni ? ” {B. 4. 51. 10).^

[34} Udyogaparvan

The Udyogaparvan furnishes its quota of references to the Bhargavas,
at least to the Bhargava Rama. Here again Rama Jamadagnya emerges
from the obscurity of myth and legend, and we find him coming into direct
contact — and in one case, actual conflict — with some of the epic characters.

In adhy. 72 ff. of the Vulgate version of the Udyoga, we have an ac-
count of a council held by the Pandavas, where Ky^ina is commissioned to go
and treat with Dhrtar^tra, which is followed in adhy. 83 ff. by a descrip-
tion of Ki^na’s journey to Hastinapura. On the way he meets a com-
pany of ancient sages, whom he duly honours. On his asking them whither
they were bound, the Bhlargava Rama, who is apparently their spokesman,
explains that they were on their way to attend the council meeting which
was going to be held at Hastinapura in order to witness the proceedings and
listen to the discussion. The sages then take leave of him and proceed on
their way. Led by Rama Jamadagnya, they arrive in due course at the
capital of the Kurus and present themselves in the darbar hall, where they
are received with due honours by Bhi§ma (adhy. 94) . The proceedings be-
gin with a long peroration by Kp^ija, in which he announces that the Rapda-
vas were ready to obey implicitly the commands of Dhjtara^tra, provided


1 But this is 852* of our edition, and it was found only in Dn ; that is,
it was added perhaps within 3 or 4 centuries !



EPIC STUDIES VI


305


they were assured that they would be treated with fairness and given what
is theirs by right (adhy. 95) . The Bhiargava Rama, taking advantage of the
spell of silence which followed Krona's diplomatic speeclt, gets up and, advis-
ing peace, relates, unasked, the story of Dambhodbihava (adhy. 96) . TTie
foolish king Dambhodbhava, who wants to be acknowledged the unconquered
and unconquerable hero, challenges in his cupidity the sages Nara and Na-
rayaaia (who were then practising 'penance at Badari) to fight with him.
The ascetics meekly decline, but Dambhodbhava is importunate. So in the
end Nara takes up a handful of grass and, charging the blades in his hand
with mystic potency, flings them at the enemy. They change into deadly
missiles, overpowering the soldiers of Dambhodbhava, and compel him to
surrender and acknowledge his defeat. Nara reads Dambhodbhava a sermon
on selficontrol, on kindness to all creatures and humility towards Brahmins.
The Bhargava Rama appearing here in the role of a [35} peace-maker con-
cludes by advising conciliation and pointing out that Nara is Arjuna, while
Narayana is Kr§ina. The story is an unnecessary digression, with the
very obvious object of reiterating and emphasizing the identity between Nara-
Naraya;ia and Arjuna-Kpsna.

The Udyogaparvan closes with a story (Ambopakhyana), in which the
Bhargava Rama plays a very active and prominent part (adhy. 173-196 of
the Vulgate) . Bhisma explains to Duryodhana that, because of a vow he had
taken, he would not fight with Sikhandin, who at birth had been a girl, and
then relates the whole life history of sikhaindin, who in a previous birth was
Amha, the daughter of the king of Kaa. Bhisma narrates how Amba, hav-
ing been disappointed of marriage through Bhi^ma’s action, vowed to com-
pass his death and how the Bhargava Rama, having promised to help her,
fought with Bhisma at Kuruk§etra for twenty-three days, a fight which ends
in a stalemate. The story is developed in this way.

When Amba was repulsed by Salva, to whom she was engaged and who
subsequently refused to marry her on account of her abduction by Bhi§ma,
she left him and wandered about alone in a neighbouring forest, nursing her
grief and vowing vengeance. There she meets a company of ascetics, who
sympathize with her and devise means to help her. While the ascetics are
cogitating as to how they should help her, there comes along by chance Am-
ba’s grandfather, the royal sage Hotravahana, who advises her to seek the
help of his jriend Rama Jiamadagnya. While these deliberations are pro-
ceeding, Rama's disciple and faithful follower Akrtavrana appears on the
scene. Hotravahana tells him the previous history of Amba and also her
future plans. Akrtavraipa decides that Bhisma is certainly responsible for
Amba's misfortunes, and is the party deserving punishment. By a fortunate
accident Rama — on the war-path, armed with a bow and a sword and his
famous axe {parasu ) — comes there the following morning. Amba again re-
lates the whole story of her unfortunate life to the Bhargava Rama and be-



306


EPIC STUDIES


seeches him to slay the offending Bhfema. But since Rama has taken the
vow that he would on no account take up arms except at the bidding of the
twice-bom, he has to be persuaded by the sages to espouse Amba’s cause.
£36} He then proceeds with Amba and all the assembled sages to the banks
of the Sarasvati and from there sends a message to Bhl^rna, who meets him
at the boundary of the Kuru kingdom. Rama orders Bhisma to take back
Amba or failing that fight a duel with him. Since Bhi§ma cannot do the
former, he decides to fight, goes back to the city and returns, furnished with
all arms and accoutrements, in a chariot made of silver, drawn by white
horses. Bhl^ma’s mother Gang&devi (identified with the river Ganges) tries
to stop the impending fight but without success. The fight lasts for several
days, when at last Rama wounded by an arrow of Bhi§ma falls down in a
swoon. Bhisma stops fighting : it is a gentlemanly duel, following minutely
all the strict rules of chivalry, and unlike the deadly combats of the Bharata
war. The fight is continued on the following days, with varying luck. Even
after many days of constant fighting, in which millions and billions of ar-
rows are showered by each combatant and cut up by the opponent, various
magical missiles are flung by which alternately the combatants get wounded,
fall down, recover and resume the fight, the grim contest continues indecisive-
ly. Then one night Bhisma, who was one of the Vasus, saw in a dream a
group of eight Brahmins (the Eight Vasus), who had supported him and
encouraged him that same day while he was lying wounded and unconscious
on the battlefield. They remind him of a magical missile of his, by dis-
charging which he could put the Bhiargava Rama to sleep on the field of bat-
tle. Next day the fight began again and the combatants hurled at each other
simultaneously the terrific Brahma missile, which is capable shattering the
earth. The two missiles clash in the middle and neutralize each other.
During the commotion caused by these weapons, Bhisma thinks of the
sleep missile. As he is about to discharge that missile, the gpds intervene.
With BhJsma's mother, Ganga, the gods go from one to the other of the
combatants, trying to pacify them. Seeing that neither of them is prepared
to 5 deld and be the first to retire from the field of battle, the gods stand bet-
ween the combatants and make the fight impossible. Still the combatants are
not pacified and will not leave! the field. Finally the shades of his ancestors
persuade Rffma to lay aside his weapons, which he then reluctantly does.
That is sufficient for Bhisma. He puts down his bow and arrow, goes to
Rama, his guru, and prostrates £37} himself at his feet. They soon forget
their quarrel and become friends again,. Thus this titanic conflict between
Bhisma and the Bhargava Riama, which is said to have lasted foir three and
twenty days, is utterly barren of any result beyond adding a few hundred
lines to the text !

One peculiar thing we notice about this story is the sudden change of
heart on the part of the BhSrgava Rama. While in all other accounts of



EPIC STUDIES VI


307


him he is represented as the inveterate foe of the K§atriyas and the epic bards
are never weary of telling us that he had exterminated the K^atriyas thrice
seven times, here we find him befriending the royal sage Hotravahana and
championing the lost cause of an unhappy K§atriya damsel ! The episode
shows another inconsistency in the behaviour of Rama ; for, here
we are surprised with the statement that in Bhi§ma Riama had taken a
Ksatriya pupil and had apparently taught him so well that the pupil knew not
only as much as the guru but perhaps even more. This does not prevent him
subsequently from cursing Kama, who had learnt the secrets of the science
of arms from Rama in the guise of a Brahmin but later had to confess that
he was a Ksatriya. There Riama is reported to have said to Kanja that the
Brahma weapon can never be learnt by one who is not a Brahmin (B. 12.
3. 31), though Bhit^ma had used the Brahma missile successfully against
   Rama in the combat mentioned above.

Bhi§maparvan

With the Bhi§maparvan begin what may be called the “ battle books,”
which in some shape or other must have formed the kernel of the Mahabha-
rata, which kernel has served as a nucleus for the growth of a vast amount of
secondary material, cohering together so as to form a more or less harmo-
nious whole. A rough sketch of the original plan of the epic is preserved in
a stanza occurring in one of the chapters of the first book (1. 55. 43) :
evam etat purdvrttam tenant aklit^akarmandm |
bhedo rdjyavimsas ca jayas cu jayatdm vara 1 1

The Bharata, according to this statement, was a trilogy consisting of the story
of the dissension, loss of the kingdom, and victory, among some descendants
of Bharata.

{38} The Bhi^maparvan, according to the Vulgate, is divided into four
sections {upaparvms) , Of these the first two are mainly geographical trac-
tates : JambukhaiDdamirmi^a-parvan and Bhumi-parvan. The third is the
famous philosophical discourse, the Bhagavad^ta, which is, so to say, the
keystone of the whole new superstructure of the remodelled Bharata and
which has passed into world literature. The fourth and last section of this
book is a lengthy account in eighty chapters (or about 4300 stanzas) of the
fight of the first ten days of the Great War, up to the fall of Bhi§ma. After
the Bhagavadgita, the account of the fight runs on smoothly and is not allow-
ed to be interrupted by any digressions. Consequently this sub-section also
contains no Bhargava episode or for that matter any other episodic narra-
tive at all. But passing allusions to the Bhargavas are not by any means
wanting even in this final section of the Bhi^maparvan. They are, however,
for the most part trivial and confined to the glorification of Rama Jamadag-
nya, playing on the theme of his encounter with Bhi^ma. The Bhargava

EPIC STUDIES


Rama is subtly praised by saying that Bhi§txia was a hero whom even Rama
could not defeat.

But the Bhagavad^ta itself contains an interesting allusion to the Bhr-
gus and that is in the tenth chapter, in the enumeration of the so-called
vibhutis of iSri-Ktwa. The vibhutis are said to be infinite {nasty onto vis-
tarasya me, Gita 10. 19 in the Vulgate version), but about sixty of them have
been specifically enumerated and they are worthy of close study. Some of
these vibhutis are pure and simple gods, such as Indra, Vi§aju, Siva and so
on. Some are yet other supernatural beings, such as Kubera, Citraratha and
others. Some are celestial luminaries such as the Sun, and the Moon. Some
are merely terrestrial features such as mountains, rivers, the ocean and so
on. Some are even animals such as the serpent (^e§a), elephant (Ainavata),
eagle (Garuda) and so on. There are mentioned among these vibhutis
only nine human — or at least semi-human, that is, semi-divine — beings,
whom we may regard as historical or semi-historical personalities. Three
of them, Vasudeva, Arjuna and Vyasa, are well-known and important
epic characters, and as such their inclusion in this list is expected and
may be said £39} to be quite natural. They may therefore be ignored.
Then, further, of divine sages (devarsis), !Sri-Kr§3ia declares himself to be
Narada, the official messenger between the gods and the men. Of perfected
beings (Siddhas), Sn-Krsna says, he is Kapila, a celebrated sage, probably
the codifier of the Saatikhya, the system most popular with the
epic bards. Of household priests, iSfi-Kr^iha identifies himself, quite
naturally again, with Brhalspati, the priest of the gods, one of the An-
girases, a clan closely connected with the Bhrgus from very ancient times.
There remain three ; of these all—or at least two — are clearly Bhargavas.
Of Kavis, Sri-Kr^-tia says, he is isukra, the Bhiargava priest of the Asuras,
the asuric counterpart of Brhaspati. Of weapon-bearers {sastra-bhrt) , Sri-
Kr§(ha declares himself to be Rama, who is identified by sotne authorities
as Rama son of Dasaratha, but who in my opinion is meant to be no other
than the much lauded hero of the Mahabharata poets, Rama' son of Jama-
dagni, the Bhargava Rama. Lastly, of great sages (mahar^is), Sri-Rr§i)a
says he is Bhrgu {maharsindm Bhfgur ahum, Gata IQ. 25).^ All other vi-
bhutis are more or less intelligible ; for each vibhuti is or may be r^arded,
more or less, as the foremost or the first of a class ; but why Bhrgu should be
considered as the greatest io/ the great sages (Mahar^is) is somewhat enig-
matic. He is not reckoned among the Seven Sages (saptar^is). He is no
doubt said to be a son of Brahma, but Brahma had nearly a dozen sons of
that kind, who all became Prajapatis and founders of gotras. And about
Bhrgu’s greatness even the Mahabharata has nothing to narrate beyond the

^ C V. VArovA, Proc. S trams : 1st Or. Conf. (1922), p. 39 (''Gotra and Pra-
vara'" p.p. 34-45) explains it differently. He is of opinion that of all R§is Bhrgu
was actually considered as the foremost.

fact that his wife Puloma was abducted by a cannibal called Puloman (Adi)
or Darhsa (Santi), and that he had cursed various people.

Dronaparvan

The Droiiaparvan supplies what is for our purpose one of the most in-
teresting of Bhiargava references in the Mahabharata.

On the thirteenth day of the Great War during Arjuna’s temporary ab-
sence, Abhimanyu with a small following pierces the Kaurava ring-formation
(cakra-vyuha) , but Jayadratha intercepts his followers and isolates him, and
Abhimanyu is slain after a brave fight ; one of the most tragic episodes of
the Great Epic. {40} To console Yudhi$thira for the untimely death of Abhi-
manyu, Vyasa tells him many stories illustrating the transitoriness of human
life. At that time he relates how Narada comforted Srhjaya in a time of
bereavement by telling him of the sixteen kings of great merit, who never-
theless all died when their time came (adhy. 55-71 of the Vulgate) . These
kings were, as a matter of fact, all cakravartins, sovereigns who had con-
quered surrounding kingdoms or brought them under their sway and estab-
lished a. paramount position on more or less extensive regions around their
own kingdoms. The episode, which is known as the SodaiSarajaldya, re-
counts the heroic deeds and the meritorious actions of sixteen of such fa-
mous kings of antiquity. The sixteen kings are these : (1) Marutta, son
of Avik§it ; (2) Suhotra Atithina ; (3) Paurava (Brhadratha, king of Ahga);
(4) iSibi, son of Usinara : (5) Rama, son of Dasaratha ; (6) Bhagiratha,
son of Dillpa ; (7) Dilipa Ailavila ; (8) Mandhatr, son of Yuvanasva ; (9)
Yayati, soti of Nahu§a ; (10) Ambari§a, son of Nabhaga ; (11) Sasabindhu,
son of Citraratha ; (12) Gaya, son of Amurtarayas ; (13) Rantideva, son of
Sathkrti : (14) Bharata, son of DutB?anta ; (15) Prthu, son of Vena ; and,
last but not least, (16) the Bhargava Rama, son of Jamadagni.

Accordingly we have here a vivid and colourful description of that great
feat of the Bhargava Rama, the ectirpation of K§atriyas, an account which
courts mistrust by its appalling exaggeration and staggering figures (adhy.
70 of the Vulgate) . We are told how Rama took a vow to relieve the Earth
of her burden of Knatriyas. Thereafter he first ^ew Kaitavirya, who was
never before defeated in battle. Then of Ksatriyas he slaughtered 64,000,
cutting off their ears and noses and breaking their teeith, besides stifling in
smoke 70(X) Haihayas (the clan to which Arjuna Klartavirya belonged) and
torturing them, and butchering 10,0(X) with his own axe. . . .Then the puis-
sant sc«i of Jamadagni, marching against the Kasmiras, the Daradas, the Kun-
tis, the Ksudrakas and Malavas, the Angas, Vahgas and Kalingas, the Vide-
has, the Tamraliptakas, the Rakgovahas, the Vltihotras, the Trigartas, the
Marttikavatas, the Sibis and other warrior races, thousands in number, slew
them all with arrows of exceeding sharpness. Going from country to coun-
try, he slew {41} thousands aind hundreds of thousands of K§atriyas, creat-

ing a veritable deluge of blood and filling many lakes with it.... Then
bringing under his sway all the eighteen divisions of the earth, that descen-
dant of Bhrgu celebrated a hundred siacrifices, like a second Indra, when he
gave away costly gifts (dak^i^d) to Brahmins. The sacrificial altar, full eight
nalas high and made entirely of gold, embellished with hundreds of gems and
adorned with thousands of banners, as5 also this earth abounding in domestic
and wild animals, was accepted by Kasyapa from the Bhargava Rama as his
sacrificial fee for performing the sacrifice. Ri^a also gave him many thou-
sands of huge elephants adorned with golden ornaments. Freeing the earth
of robbers that infested her, making her full of rigliteous and amiable peo-
ple, Rama gave the earth to Kasyapa at his great horse sacrifice. Then
comes the Bhargava slogan (B. 7. 70. 20) :

triJ^saptakrtvak prthivlm krtvd nihksatiydm prabhuh | (IV)

Having cleared the earth of Ksatriyas thrice ^ven times, having cele-
brated a hundred sacrifices, Rama gave the earth to the Brahmins. When
the earth with her seven grand divisions was bestowed by him upon Kasyapa,
then the latter said to Rama, “ Go thou out of this earth at my command !”
Hearing these words of Kasyapa, that foremosit of weapon-bearers, obedient
to the command of a Brahmin, caused the ocean to roll hack and to give him
a new strip of land to live in, and Rama took up his abode on Mount Ma-
hendra.

It is instructive to compare this Story of Sixteen Kings with a variant
version of it in the iSanti (adhy. 29 of the Vulgate), as related td the same
Yudhi§thira by Sil-Kmna. After the battle the month of mourning is spent
outside the capital on the banks of the Ganges. Yudhi§thira, very dejected,
proposes to renounce the kingdom and retire to the forest. At Arjuna's re-
quest, Kr§na tries to console him and' so relates to him the Story of Sixteen
King^ which Narada had once related to king Sriijaya. The stories are na-
turally almost the same as those rdated to Yudhi'§thira by Vyasa after the
death of Abhimanyu. There is, however, one very striking difference. Fif-
teen of the kings in the list are the same ; the sixteenth “ king ” of the Drorja
list, namely, the Bhargava Rama, is conspicuous by his absence in the i&nti
{42} list ! He is replace^ by a real kihg. Sagara son of Ifc§vaku, who was
indeed a very famous king, fully deserving to be included in this list of the
celebrated sixteen kings of antiquity, whereas the Bhargava Rama was no
king at all and does not properly fall into this enumeration. His “ extermin-
ation of the Ksatriyas was merely an act of vendetta. And although he is
said to have conquered the whole earth, he never was crowned a king. There-
fore the propriety of including his exploits in the $oda4ariajakiya is more
than questiofiable. In fact it would never strike anybody except an unscru-
pulous Brahmin redactor— with strong Bhargava leanings— to perpetrate
such a tendentious perversion and father it upon Vyasa.



EPIC STUDIES VI


311


KARIsIAPARVAN

Kama is represented in our epic as a pupil of the Bhargava Rama, like
Bhl§ma and Drona. So there are several casual references — in his capacity
as the guru of Karina — ^to Rama Jamadagnya in the course of this parvan.

In adhy. 31 (of the Vulgate),, we have a reference to the bow (Vijaya)
which Kama had received from the Bhargava Rama, who in his' turn had
obtained it from Indra himself. Indra had used it in his fight with the
Daityas : Rama had used it in his campaign against the Ki^atriyas of the
earth, which he had conquered thrice seven times (B. 8. 31. 46) :

triijisaptakrtvah pjthivi dhanu^d yena nirjitd ] (V)

On the seventeenth day of the war, Ehiryodhana persuades' isalya to be
Kamja’s charioteer and to encourage him tells the story how Karina had be-
come possessed even of celestial weapons through the Bhargava Rama.

To emphasize further the great importance of Kania, Duryodhana then
narrates a story which shows the greatness of KariiTia’s guru, Rama Jamad-
agnya (adhy. 34 of the Vulgate). Rama is generally represented
in the !^fehabharata as a man — or rather a Superman — who had fought his
battles on this earth with other human beings like himself. Here we are
told that he had fought with and vanquished even the Daityas. The story is
this. To obtain celestial weapons from Mahadeva, Rama (like the P^ip^ava
Arjun^ later) was practising terrible austerities. At that time £43} the
Asuras had become so powerful that even all the gods together could not
subdue them, and so Mahadeva asks the Bhargava Rama to fight with them
(as Arjuna later fought with the Nivatakavacas and other demons). Rama
went up to the Asuras and said to them, Most invincible in battle as you
are, O Daityas, give me battle’'. Then the Daityas began to fight with
Rama. Then that delighter of the Bhargava clan slaughtered those Daityas,
on the battle-field by strokes that were like the strokes from Indra’s thunder-
bolt. After Rama had vanquished the invincible Asuras without the use of
any special weapons, then Mahadeva gave him those celestial missiles for
which Rama was practising the terrible austerities. Perhaps feeling that
the story might be disbelieved, Duryodhana hastens to add that he had heard
it himself from the lips of a pious and truthful Brahmin while the latter was
relating it to king Dhrtar^ra, Duryodhana’s father.

Then in adhy. 42 (of the Vulgate), Kaiina relates that under the guise
of a Brahmin he had been a disciple of the Bhargava Rama in order to learn
from him the secret of certain magical mi^les known to Rama alone. One
day while Rama was sleeping with his head resting in the lap of Kanja, the
thigh of the latter was bored through by Indra (Arjuna’s de facto father)
in the form of a ferocious centipede, and Kania was weltering in blood but
did not move a muscle, for fear of disturbing the sleep of his guru and thus
incurring his displeasure. When Rama woke up and saw this state of things,



312


EPIC STUDIES


he concluded that his disciple was no Brahmin, as only a Ksatriya could
suffer such agony and keep still. Then Karpa confesses his guilt and begs
Rama’s pardcwi. Rama pronounces a curse on Kanja, saying that at the
critical moment the magical missiles of which he had obtained knowledge
from Rama by such a dastardly trick — even the great Yogi could not see
through it — ^would fail him. Brahma could never reside firmly in one who is
not a Brahmin : abrahmoaie brahma no hi dhruvarii sydt (B. 8. 42. 9.) And
so it happened, needless to say.

In a variant version of this tale (iSanti 3 in the Vulgate) the worm
which had bored through Kaiiija’s thi^ is said to have been not Indra in
disguise, but a demon suffering the effects of a curse pronounced on him by
Bhrgu !

1:44} •Salyaparvan

In the Salyaparvan there are only stray references to the Bhargavas, es-
pecially in the account of Balarama's pilgrimage — another very obvious dig-
ression — during which Balarama visits of course all the places sacred to the
Bhargavas such as Ramatirtha, Samantapahcaka and so on, which lay on
his way.

At Ramatirtha we have a repetition of the story that Kasyapa officiated
at the sacrifice celebrated by Rama Bhargava after conquering the whole
earth and annihilating the K§atriyas (B. 9. 49. 7 f.) :

Sauptikaparvan

The Sauptika is one of the few books of the Mahabharata which are
entirely, or almost entirely, free from reference to the Bhargavas. The book
is short, consisting of 18 chapters and about 800 stanzas in the Vulgate ver-
sion, and comprises only two sub-parvans : the Sauptika and the Ai^ika. The
first sub-parvm describes the slaughter of the sleepers in the camp of the
Piaijdavas, while the second gives an account of the use of the worldijdesitroy-
ing dart Ai§ika by Asvatthaman.

STRiPARVAN

In the next book, the Striparvan, which like the former is short, con-
sisting of 27 chapters and about 800 stanzas in the Vulgate version, there are
only three incidental references to the Bhargavas. The pmvm ccMisists almost
wholly of the description of the obsequial ceremonies of the warriors killed in
the war and lamentations of women over their dead kinsfolk, which is fortu-
nately held free from digressions and interpolations. The tragedy also does



EPIC STUDIES VI

not permit the development of any other sentiment. The absence of reference
to the Bhargavas, who, as already remarked, had strictly Speaking no con-
nection whatsoever with the Kuru-Pancala heroes, is not only thoroughly
£45} appropriate, but is an omission for which we may be truly grateful to
the redactors of our Mahabhiarata.

ISANTIPARVAN

The iSanti, which is in esisence a manual of instruction in king-^raft
{rdjadhmma), conduct in time of calamity (dpaddharma) and emancipa-
tion {mok^<idharma) compiled in the peculiar pedagogic technique developed
by the redactors of the Great Epic for the edification of the people combined
with their entertainment, supplies its quota of Bhargava material, making up
in some measures for the deficiency of the last three books.

Already in adhy. 2 f. (of the Vulgate) we hear of the Bhargava Rama.
The month of mourning is spent by the Pandavas outside the capital on the
banks of the Ganges. There Narada relates to Yudhisthira the story of the
early career of Kama, which is here said to be a secret of the gods {deva-
guhya). Tn the course of the narrative Narada repeats with more details
the story we have already noticed as to how Karija had easily deceived the
Bhargava Rama and obtained from him the carefully guarded secret of the
famous Brahma missile (brahmdstra) under the false pretence of being a
Bramin, and a Bhfgu too. An interesting point of difference between this
version of the story and that given in the Karoaparvan is, as mentioned
already, that the worm which bites Kama and bores a hole through his leg
is not Indra but a demon called Damsa, who had tried to carry off Bhrgu’s
wife. If this wife be Puloma, then her ravisher's name was given as Puloman
in adhy. 4 of the Adi, where, however, there is no mention of Bhfgu’s curse ;
but we are told on the other hand that the ravisher of Puloma was reduced
to ashes by Bhrgu’s son Cyavana. But perhaps this demon Darhsa is some
other ravisher of Bhrgu’s wife.

In any event the happy result of this discourse of the sage was that
Yudhisthira, casting off grief, enters the capital in state, is installed on the
throne and performs the obsequial ceremonies of his departed kinsmen. Later
Kiima in an ecstatic trance communes with the distant Bhi§ma, who remains
lying on the battlefield on a bed of arrows and who in a long hymn of ado-
ration invokes Krmai. Krma then sets out with the Paajdava brothers and
his followers £46} to visit Bhfema on his death-bed. The arrival of the party
at the battle-field, which it will be remembered has been identified by the
redactors of the epic with the Bhargava tMka Samantapancaka, affords an
easy opportunity for another repetition of the legend of Rama's heroic exploit.
That was the very spot where the BMrgava Rama had established those
five lakes of blood. l§ii-K|Tma in passing points to those lakes and says
(B. 12. 48. 9) :

21

Yudhi^thira, the “dummy” of the rhapsode, has an insatiable longing to
hear all about the extermination of the Ki^triyas by the Bhargava Rama
though he had heard it all before from other story-tellers, and he has besides
some doubts which he forthwith refers to Kiwa (B, 12. 48. 10) :
trihsaptukUvab prthivi krtd nihksatriyd pure |

Rdme^eti tathattha tvt^m atra me samsayo maMn |1 (VII)

To solve this doubt of Yudhi§thira Kr^^oa gratuitously volunteers to re-
peat the whole story of Riama from the very beginning, a full-size account
of the birth of the Bhargava Rama, of the extirpation of the K)§atriyas and of
the subsequent regeneration of the race. Here we have now an attestation of
the entire story by iSri-Kn§tiia, a variant of the story told by Alqtavrafrja, a
disciple of Rama, to Yudhii^tbira himself in the Arapyaka. There are natu-
rally several discrepancies between the two versions, two of which are note-
worthy. In the first version it was Satyavati's father-in-law who prepares
the magical carus, which were subsequently exchanged by the good ladies who
were to partake of them ; here it is Satyavati’si husband himself, Rcika, who
prepares them. The other is a somewhat more serious discrepancy. In the
Araipyaka version, Jamadagni was robbed of his calf by Arjuna Kartavirya
himself, who is represented there as a perfect fiend. In the stbry as told
by (Sri-Kr^pa, Arjuna is a perfect angel of a man, always devoted to peace,
ever obedient to Brahmins and ready to protect all classes ; he had given
away the earth to Brahmins in a horse sacrifice which he had performed.
His sons on the other hand were “ proud and cruel ”, and it was they who
brought away the calf of Jamadagni s sacrificial £47} cow. As it is difficult,
at this distance of time, in the absence of independent evidence, to say whe-
ther Akrtavraipa or Sri-Kr$oa was more truthful, it must remain a moot point
whether the guilty party is Arjuna Kartavirya or his sons. Then Sri-Kr^pa
goes on to tell Yudhi^thira that the Ki§atriyas were annihilated by the Bhar-
gava Rama thrice seven times, speaking exactly like a Bhargava (B. 12. 49.
64) :

tribsaptakjtvab prthwlm kftvd nihk^atriydm pr€d>hub I
dak^ifj^m asvamedhdnte Kasyapdyddadat tatab || (VIII)

The matter being now attested by i§ri-Kiwa himself, it cannot be described
by revilers of Brahmins as a fabricaticm made by the Brahmins themselves.

It must always have been something of a puzzle to all thoughtful persons
where K^triyas like the Kauravas and the Paipdavas and even (Sri-<K|i§IOa
himself came from after the Rsatriya race had been wiped out thrice seven
times by the Bhargava Riama, and that was in fact Yudhi^hira's doubt,
which he had expresised to iSri-Krsipa. Various explanations of the ttiystery
have been propounded. In the earlier chapters of the epic, ab we have seen

several times, it was the pious Brahminsi who procreated children on the
widows of the K^atriyas slain by Rama and they became K^triyas by the
Vedic rule pariigrahasya tanayalp (1. 98. 5) : the child belongs to him who
has gone through the form of marriage with the mother. That was however
not the view of Sri-Kp^oa. His explanation was that the Earth had concealed
some K^atriyas.^ She had concealed some Haihayas among women, some
Pauravas among the bears of Mount Rk^vant. Some other K§atriyas were
brought up in the forest among the kine, some in the cowpens among the
calves. Some were protected by the Ocean, some by the wolves^ on Mount
Grdhrakuta. These had all escaped destruction at the hands of the formid-
able Bhlargava. And the old K]§atriya dynasties were resuscitated by Ka4-
yapa, who first ordered Rama to clear out from the earth which he had given
to Kasyapa as a part of the sacrificial fee and restored by and by those
scions of the old K^atriya families to their rightful heritage. iSri-Kr^na
evidently did not know anything about the procreation of K^atriyas by pious
Brahmins on the widows of the K§atriyas slaughtered by the bloodthirsty
Bhargava. He con-{48}-cludes by remarking that the present K§atriyas are
the legitimate offsprings of those ancient K§atriyas (B. 12. 49. 88 f.) :
prthivyd nirdistams tan samdnlya KasyapaJj, j
ubhya^incan mahlpdldn ksatriym viryasammatdn | j
te0m putrds ca pautrds ca ye^m vamsdk pratisthitdh 1

At the beginning of the third great sub-division of the Santi, the Moksa-
dharma, we have a lengthy discourse attributed to Bhfgu, called the Bhrgu-
Bharadvaja-samvada (adhy. 182-192 of the Vulgate), which summarizes in
the form of questions and answers almost the entire Brahmanic teaching on
the subject of (1) the elements, (2) life and death, (3) caste distinctions,
(4) good and evil, (5) the four stages of life, and finally, (6) the other
world. It will be seen that it is a complete tractate on Hindu Ontology,
Sociology, Eschatology and Ethics that is here attributed to Bhrgu, the
eiX)nymou^ ancestor of the Bhargavas,

The oft-cited stanza B. 12. 339. 103 f. :

from the Mok^adharma is important as containing one of the two actual
references in our Mahabhiarata to the Bhargava Rama as an amidra of

in some Grantha MSS. and some old Devanagari MSS. which have been

collated by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute for a critical edition
of that book. The other reference is in the same chapter, a few stanzas
earlier (B. 12. 339. 84) :

Tretdyuge bhavi^ydmi Rdmo Bhfgukulodvalmlp [

K^atram cotsddayi^ydmi samrddhabaluvdhanam ] [

This stanza cannot be impugned on the score of documentary evidence,
which is unanimous in its favour. But both references occur in the Naraya-
Oiya section of the Mok§adharma, which is notoriously a late addition to
our Mahabharata. This shows that the theory of avatdtas is still develop-
ing in the epic and their number is not yet fixed, nor are the avatdras fully
canonized. It should thus seem that the Mahabharata does not £49} neces-
sarily presuppose the Bhargava Rama to be an avatdra of Vi§hu.

Anusasanaparvan

The Anu^Sana, for some reason that is not yet quite clear, is the richest
in Bhargava material.

Early in the beginning of this book (adhy. 4), we have the third repe-
tition of the legend of the birth of Jamadagni. The previous chapter (3)
relates the mighty deeds of the K§atriya Visvamitra, which led to his attain-
ing the coveted status of a Brahmin. In adhy. 4, BhJ^ma explains how it
came about that Visvamitra who was of mingled Brahmin and K§atriya
parentage was born in the K§atriya caste with Brahmanic qualities, while his
nephew Jamadagni, under" similar conditions, was born in the Brahmin caste
with K^atriyan qualities. We have here a repetition of the old story how
Bdka married Gadhi’s daughter Satyavati, who obtained some boons' for
herself and her mother. The mother and the daughter exchange the trees
they had to embrace and earns of which they had to partake. The wise
Rdka had purposely made the prescriptions differently. He had in fact put
the entire accumulated energy of Brahmanism in the earn of his wife, while
he had put the entire accumulated energy of K^atriyahood in the earn in-
tended for her mother. The consequence of the exchange slyly effected by
the mother was that the son of Gadhi’s wife turned out to be a man with
Brahmanic propensities, while the son of IJdka’s wife would have been a
model K§atriya ; but, owing to the pleadings of Satyavatl, the great sage
graciously gives his consent to the pc^tponement of the doom to Satyavati’s
grand-son.

This story we have had at Arainyaka 115 and Santi 49 of the Vulgate.
In passing it may be mentioned that the present version agrees with the
Santiparvan version in making IJdka the giver of the boons, whereas in the
Arainyaka version this person is some ancestor of IJdka, either Boka’s father
or perhaps Bhrgu himself.

The mere mention of Bhargava Rama in B. 13. 14 . 273 at once calls
forth the reaction :

Jamadckpiyena Govinda Rdfne^dkli^t(^karma^d || etc. (IX)

In adhy. 30 (of the Vulgate) we are told how a K^atriya Vitahavya was
made a Brahmin by the mere word of a Bhrgu. The story isl as follows.

Vatsa, a descendant of Saryati had two sons, Haihaya and T&lajahgha.
The hundred sons of Haihaya attacked and killed Haryasva, king of Ka^,
whose son Sudeva succeeded him on the throne. Sudeva was) likewise de-
feated and killed by the Haihayas. Sudeva was succeeded by Divodasa, who
built Vara^a^, on the northern bank of Ganges and the southern bank of
the Gomati. Likewise defeated by the Haihayas, he fled to his priest Bharad-
vaja, who obtained for him, through sacrifice, a son Pratardana. The son
of Divodasa defeated in turn all the Haihayas, when Vitahavya pursued by
Pratardana, fled to the hermitage of Bhrgu. When ^Pratardana demanded
from Bhrgu the surrender of Vitahavya, who was hiding in Bhrgu’s hermit-
age, Bhrgu in order to save the life of Vitahavya said that there were only
Brahmins in the hermitage. Through that declaration of Bhrgu, who could
not tell a lie, Vitahavya actually became a Brahmin. His descendants are
set out for fifteen generations. His son was Grtsamada, whose eleventh des-
cendant was Pramati : his son was Ruru ; his son was Sunaka, from whom
came the Saunakas.

In adhy. 40, Bhi§ma expatiates on the fascination and frailty of wo-
men, the root of all evil, and to support his statement he relates the story
of Vipula, another Bhargava, an interesting story in which mesmerism or
hypnotism plays some part (Vipulopiakhylana, adhy. 40-43 in the Vulgate).

The sage Devasarman, the story goes, had a beautiful wife Ruci (Beau-
ty) by name, who had attracted the attention of the gay king of the gods,
Indra. Once upon a time it so happened that Devasarman had to go away
from his hermitage on some sacrificial business. Not feeling quite sure about
his little Ruci, the old sage taking into his confidence his disciple, the Bhai-
gava Vipula, told him to protect his slender-waisted wife, especially against
the amorous advances of Indra, who was an adept at assuming different forms
at will. Deva^rman pathetically en-{51}-joined his disciple to take every
care and see that the lascivious king of the celestials did not defile that frivol-
ous wife of his, like a wretched dog licking the havis placed near the sacrificial
altar. To protect the virtue of Ruci, who was peerless on earth in beauty,
Vipula decided to enter into her by his yogic power and live in her without
her being conscious of it, until the critical moment was passed. Indra comes
as expected and makes overtures to the beautiful Ruci, who had captivated his
mind. Ruci, though anxious to reciprocate, remains externally indifferent
to the blandishments of Indra, through the influence of Vipula, who was
living within her and guiding her actions. Indra, puzzled by the behaviour
of Ruci, reflects and realizes how matters stand. At that moment Vipula
leaves the body of Ruci and re-enters his own body. Then Vipula faces the

philanderer and soundly rebukes him, and Indra slinks away abashed. Only
one man had been able to protect a woman and that was the Bhargava Vi-
pula (B. 13. 43. 27) :

tenaikena tu rak§d vai Vipulena kftd striydip |
ndnyak saktas triloke 'smin rak^tum nrpa ya^itam 1 1

This story was told by the Bhargava Markao<3eya to Bh!§ma (B. 13.
43. 18) and repeated by the latter to Yudhii^thira.

A few chapters later we have again a Bhargava story, the Cyavanopa-
khyiana in seven chapters (50-56), which is divided into two parts : the first
two chapters (50-51) illustrate the sanctity of cows, the last five deal really
with that topic of perennial interest, the mingled Brahmin and K§atriya pa-
rentage of the Bhargava Rama.

The first story, in which a cow was found to be the only equivalent
possible for the ransom of the sage Cyavana, may be passed over.

In the second story (adhy. 52-56), we come back to the anecdote of
Rama Jtoadagnya, and we have here practically a repetition of the explana-
tion given above (in adhy. 4 of this very par van) of the circumstances under
which Vi^vamitra, who was of mixed Brahmin and K§atriya parentage was
born in the K§atriya caste with Brahmanic qualities, while Rama under simi-
lar conditions was bom in the Brahmin caste with the oppo-{52}-site quali-
ties. The repetition comes about in this way. Yudhi§thira, whose curiosity
about the Bhargava Rama is, as already remarked, never satisfied, says to
Bhi§ma (B. 13. 52. 1 ff.) : '‘I have a great curiosity, O Lord, about Ja-
madagni's son Rama, that foremost of all righteous persons. You should
satisfy that curiosity. How was Rtoia bom, that tmly valorous hero? He
belonged by birth to a family of Brahmin sages. How did he become a
follower of K§atriyan practices? Relate to me in detail the circumstances
of Rama’s birth. Also how did a man bom in the family of the Ku§ikas, who
was a Ksatriya, become a Brahmin? Great indeed was the power of the
high-souled Rama afe also that of Vi^vamitra ! ”

The answer is given by Bhi^ma by relating the prophecy which had been
made by Cyavana, an ancestor of the Bhargava Rama. Cyavana wants to
prevent the harm that will come to his clan by Rama’s adopting the practices
of the K§atriyas, a danger of which he has prophetic knowledge. He repairs
to Kusika, through whose descendant the harm was to happen, in order to
vex him, and, if he finds a favouraible opportunity to pronounce a maledic-
tion on Kuiika, damning him and his descendants to eternal perdition. When
the sage presents himself before the king and says that he wants to observe a
certain vow while living in the palace with the king, he is warmly welcomed
with unfeigned joy, and also served with meticulous care and obsequiousness
by the king and the queen. The sage has a meal and he then sleeps for
twenty-one days, during which the king and the queen wait upon him with-
out food or drink, gently massaging his 1^. Suddenly the sage wakes

up and goes out, followed with trepidation by the king and the queen, and
as suddenly vanishes ! The king looks for in vain, and, returning in a de-
jected mood to the room set apart for the sage, finds him again, stretched as
before on his luxurious bed ! The sage practises many tricks of this type,
calculated to try the patience of the unfortunate couple, and ultimately yokes
them to a heavily laden war-chariot. During the drive through the city,
the sage gives the royal couple vicious digs with a heavy iron goad, distri-
buting all the while in charity the entire wealth of the king. Still the sage
finds no change in their behaviour. So in the end he has to {53} express
himself as satisfied with their treatment of him and he goes back to the
forest, asking the royal couple to come there on the following day. The king
and queen take a little rest for the first time after forty-two days of trial and
spend the night happily in each other’s company. The next morning the
king and the queen go to the forest to pay their respects to the sage and see
there a magnificent palace standing in a big park, a fair imitation of Indra's
paradise. After a short while, the magical palace and the park vanish, and
there sits in the solitude of the forest the sage who had yoked them to the
chariot and ill-treated them in other ways. Then the king feels that Brah-
mic power was the summum bonum of life. When he approaches Cyavana,
the sage gives him a boon. Kuiika wants to know why Cyavana had come
to live with him and what all those incidents implied. Cyavana tells him
frankly what his intention was and also prophesies that Kusika’s wish would
be fulfilled in so far that a descendant of Ku^ika’s (Vi^vamitra) would be-
come a Brahmin. Through the lustre of the Bhrgus, Kusika’s grandson
(Vi^vamitra) would be an ascetic endowed with the splendour of fire (B.
13. 55. 32) :

Bhrgunam eva tejasd ]
pautras te bhavitd vipras tapasvi pdvakadyutih ||

Then follows in the final chapter Cyavana’s prophecy about the persecu-
tion of the Bhtgus, about Urva (or Aurva), about Rdka, and Jamadagni,
who will marry Gadhi’s daughter, that is, Kusika’s grand-daughter. Of the
boons that will be given to the two ladies by Bhrgu, the exchange of the trees
and the earns by the mother and the daughter, about Visvamitra, and so on
and so forth. Incidentally it may be mentioned that this is the fourth oc-
currence of this interesting story of the birth of the Bhargava Rama, it hav-
ing occurred already at adhy. 4 of this very parvan, and ibefore that in the
iSanti (adhy. 48) and the Aranyaka (adhy. 115-117).

Some chapters later we again meet with the Bhargava Rama when
Bhi§ma tells Yudhii§thira about the merit of the gift of gold. The shades of
his ancestors had appeared to Bhi§ma and told him that the gift of gold
purifies the giver. Now it happens that the same advice had been given to
the Bhargava Rama by Vasi^tha and other sages. In this connection we
have again an {54} allusion to the extirpation of the K^atriyas and the con^

quest of the earth by Rama (B. 13. 84. 31) :

trifisaptakrtvafji prthivi krtd nihksatriyd pum 1

tato jitvd mahim krtsndm Rdmo rdjtvalocanah || etc. (X)

The next chapter (85), a long rambling chapter with 168 stanzas, deals
with the mystery, already alluded to above, of the birth of Bhrgu, Ahgiras
and Kavi. They are said to be prajdpatis and progenitors of many tribes
and clans, in fact of the entire mankind .

It will be a surprise to many that our sandals and umbrellas we also owe
to a Bhrgu. Chapter 95 relates how the practice arose of giving umbrellas
and sandals to Brahmins at srdddhas and other religiousi rites. Once upon
a time Jamadagni was amusing himself by shooting arrows at a distant tar-
' get, and his wife Renuka was fetching the arrows shot by him. Sorely afflic-
ted by the scorching heat of the midday sun, she rested just for a moment
under the shade of an umbrageous tree. Being kept waiting, the irascible
Bhrgu scolded his wife for her tardiness, but on learning the real cause of
the delay, wanted to shoot down the offending sun from his high position
in the heavens. The frightened luminary comes to him in the guise of a
poor Brahmin, who tries to dissuade him from carrying out his terrible threat,
but is recognized by the Bhrgu and reprimanded. In the end Jamadagni
is pacified and receives from the stm the first umbrella and the first pair of
leather sandals. To make a gift of them to Brahmins is highly meritorious.
This account of the origin of shoes and sandals is, I believe, not found out-
side the Mahabharata.

In adhy. 98 (of the Vulgate) we have a report by Bhi§ma of a discus-
sion between the Bhargava Sukra and Bali about flowers, lamps, aromatics,
appropriate to be offered to gods on diverse occasions and the merit accruing
from the presentation.

Above, while discussing the Dronaparvan version of the §oda;sarajaldya,
I had referred to palpable evidence of the “ bhrguization ” of a legend. We
have another illuminating instance of the process in the next story (adhy.
99-l()0 of the £55} Vulgate) told by Bhi^ma to Yudhi§thira. It is another
version of the well-known legend of Nahu^a’s fall from heaven.

Nahu^a, when king of the gods, neglected the daily offerings to the
gods including the bali, losing thereby some of his spiritual power. Subse-
quently, having oppressed the sages, he was hurled down from heaven and
turned into a boa by the curse of a Brahmin sage, Bhrgu.

A similar version of this legend occurs in the Udyoga (adhy. 11-17)
and is again alluded to in the Santi (adhy. 342) . There it is related that
Nahu§a became extremely arrogant and caused the sages to carry his palan-
quin. While being carried about in this way, his foot touched the head of
Agastya, who by his curse turned him into a boa. The defect in the cons-
truction of this n^Ve story is very obvious and must have been early noticed
by the diaskeuasts themselves. Nahu^a, by the terms of the boon which



EPIC STUDIES VI


321


Brahma and the gods had foolishly given him, could absorb the power of
any being on whom he set his eyes. Under these circumstances, even the
resourceful Agastya could not effectively curse Nahu^a, because Agastya,.
when kicked by the tyrant, being in full view of the other, was ipso jacto
deprived of all his spiritual power, like all the gods and sages who had been
oppressed by Nahusa and were utterly powerless before him.

The revised version of the legend in the Anu4asana stages beforehand a
confabulation between Bhrgu and Agastya. Agastya wants to damn Nahu§a
but does not know how to. Bhrgu befriends him and gives him the assurance
that he (Bhrgu) would somehow bring about the downfall of the tyrant,
Bhrgu, who knows beforehand, by spiritual prevision, that Nahusa was go-
ing to kick Agastya, proposes to Agastya, in anticipation of it, that on a
certain day he would sit hidden inside the matted locks of the sage and from
that position he would curse Nahusa. So when the opportune moment came,
Bhrgu, possessed of great lustre, addressed Agastya as follows : ‘‘ Do you
shut your eyes, Agastya, while I enter into the matted hair of your head ” .
Having said this, Bhrgu of unfading glory and great energy entered into the
locks of Agastya, who stood still like a wooden post. Soon after, Nahu§a
saw Agastya approached for being yoked to his chariot. Bhrgu, who was sit-
ting in the matted locks of Agastya, took £56} care not to look at Nahu§a.
Fully acquainted with the power which the illustrious Nahusa had acquired
on account of the boon which Brahma had given him, Bhrgu had acted thus.
Agastya though thus treated by Nahu§a did not yield to anger. Then Nahu-
vsa urged Agastya with his goad. The pious sage Agastya still did not yield
to anger. The lord of celestials, himself enraged at this pusillanimity, then
struck Agastya on the head with his left foot. When the sage was thus
struck on the head, then Bhrgu, who was sitting within the matted locks of
Agastya, became incensed and cursed the sinful Nahusa saying, “ Thou hast
kicked the head of the great sage, fall down therefore on the earth, changed
into a boa ! '' Thus imprecated by Bhrgu, who had not been seen, Nahu§a
forthwith became transformed into a boa and in that form dropped down on
the earth.

Yudhi^thira, who had heard a different version of the story from Salya,
as narrated in the Udyoga, maintains naturally a discreet silence about these
discrepancies and proceeds to question Bhi!§ma about some other matters on
which he wanted information.

Next, in the course of a long passage devoted to the praise of Brahmins,
showing that the Brahmins are mightier than even the gods, the story of
Cyavana is repeated (adhy. 156) .

Cyavana, who had been rejuvenated and cured of blindness by the As-
vins, had, as we have seen, promised them that they should drink Soma with
Indra and the other gods. The gods were wavering in their mind, but Indra
was adamant. He refused to accept the Soma libation in Cyavana’s sacrifice,

' This Uttahkopakhyana contains the last important reference in the Maha-
bharata to the Bhargavas, linking up with that in adhy. 3 of the Adi.

There are still a few more Bhiargava stories in the Mahabharata, the
consideration of which I had intentionally postponed and to which we shall
now turn.

We run into a nest of Bhargava legends, as a matter of fact, already ir
the fourth sub-section of the Adi, the Paulomaparvan, which have not been
discussed above.

The Mahabharata, as is well known, has two variant openings. In the
first (Adi. 1), when the Suta (or, according to some editions, Sauti) Ugra-
sravas, who is to recite the Mahabharata, presents himself at the hermitage
of Kulapati '^aunaka, during the twelve-year sacrificial session inaugurated
by the sage in the sacred Naimi§a Forest and offers to recite stories for the
edification and entertainment of the guests, the sages assembled there express
their desdre to hear the celebrated Mahabharata (1. 1. 18 f.) :
Janamejayasya yam rdjno V aisampdyana uktavdn |
yathdvat sa r^is tuUy^ Dvcdpdyandjfiayd ||
vedais caturbhiff. samitdm Vydsasyddbhutakarmanah j
sathhitdm sTotum icchdmo dharmydfk pdpdbhaydpahdni 1 1
The Suta accordingly commences with some mangala stanzas (1. 1. 20) :

£60} ddyath puru^am tsdnam puruhutam purustutam j

rtam ekdksaram brahma vyaktdvyaktam sandtanam | j etc.,
which are followed by a sort of prologue, which latter languishes and breaks
off somewhere.

In adhy. 4 of the Adi, we come upon another opening, whidi totally
ignores the first ! The Suta is re-introduced. The scene is the same, but
the programme is changed. Here the assembled sages do not themselves order
the entertainment, but ask the Suta to wait until the Kulapati iSaunaka
comes. When in the next chapter (5), the Kulapati joins the company, after
having duly performed his round of daily duties, he instead of asking the Suta
to narrate the Mahabharata, as the sages in the first instance had done, tells
him, strange to say, to relate first the history of the Bhargavas (1. 5. 3).
tatra vamsam ahath purvam srotum icchdmi Bhdrgavam |
kathayasva hathdm etdih kalydii sma sravane tava | ]

The Suta obediently proceeds to relate the history of that “ most illus-
trious family of the Bhrgus, which is honoured even by the celestials with
Indra, Agni and the Maruts"' (1. 5. 5). Here the Bhargava interest is very
clear and unmistakable. Accordingly eight chapters (5-12), which form the
Paulomaparvan, are entirely consecrated to an account of the wonderful deeds
of some of the Bhargavas, an account which is not even remotely connected
in actual fact with the incidents or characters of our epic. It is a digression
pure and simple, introduced with the very obvious object of glorifying the
Bhargavas and giving a permanent form to some of the Bhirgava myths and



EPIC STUDIES VI


325


legends. These chapters .are a short history of one special branch of the
Bhargava clan, represented by : Bhfgu, Cyavana, Pramati, Rum and Sunaka.
The significance of this branch and its connection with our version of the
Mahabharata will become apparent presently.

Bhrgu, a sage of almost mythical character, the eponymous ancestor of
the family, is here said to have been created from Brahma from the sacri-
ficial fire during Vamiia’s sacrifice (216*) :

Bhrgur mahar^ir bhagavan Brahmmd vai svayamhhuvd ]

Va^unasya kratau jdtah pdvQkdd iti nah srutam\\

£61} This interpolated stanza (found only in N) contradicts the statetnent
in the main body of the text (documented jointly by N and S) to the effect
that Bhrgu was born by piercing the heart of Brahma (1. 60. 40) :

Brahmaru) hjdayam bhittvd nihsrto bhagavdn Bhjguh 1
While Bhrgu’s wife Puloma was pregnant, the story continues (adhy. 5-6),
there came to Bhrgu’s hermitage, during his absence, a demon {rdksasa),
Puloman, who became enamoured of her and wanted to carry her off. To
make sure of his facts, however, the demon asked Agni whether she was
really Bhrgu’s wife. The fact was that this Puloma was first betrothed to
Puloman and afterwards given by her father to Bhrgu, and Puloman wanted
to have his Puloma back. On getting from Agni an answer in the affirma-
tive, the demon, assuming the form of a boar, carried her off. On the
way Cyavana is born. His lustre instantly reduces to ashes the demonic
ravisher of his mother and saves her from a very awkward predicament.
Puloma returns home safely with the baby. Bhrgu only learns of this inci-
dent after his return to the hermitage. Incensed at the outrage, he curses the
god Agni, whom he regards as the prime cause of the disaster, saying that
Agni would be an eater of all things, good and bad {sarva-bhaksa) .

There follows in adhy, 8 the story of Ruru, son of Pramati. Menaka
an apsaras, abandons her beautiful daughter near the hermitage of the sage
Sthulake§a. She is called Pramadvara. Pramati arranges her marriage with
his son Ruru, who has fallen in love with her. Shortly before the celebration
of their marriage Pramadvara is bitten by a venemous snake and dies, leav-
ing Ruru disconsolate. By the miraculous powers of his austere penance,
this Bhargava gives up half of his life to Pramadvara and revives her, and
ultimately marries her. Ruru takes a vow to destroy all the snakes in the
world, like Janamejaya before him, whose father Pariksit had died as the
result of a snake-bite. One day Ruru cotnes across a harmless old snake of
the variety known as 4m4ubha (adhy, 9), The snake begs to be spared and
so Ruru does not kill it. The serpent body only concealed the metamor-
phosed soul of a sage, who was suffering the effects of a curse pronounced on
him in a previous birth (adhy. 10). The £62} sage declares akimsd to be
the highest duty of a Brahmin. Janamejaya had once tried to destroy the
race of snakes by performing a snake sacrifice ; they were saved by the Brah-



326


EPIC STUDIES


min Astika (adhy. 11). Ruru subsequently hears the story of Janamejaya’s
snake sacrifice from his father Pranvati (adhy. 12). This story of the snake
sacrifice as told by Pramati to his son Ruru was repeated verbatim by the
Suta to saunaka and forms in our version of the Mahabhiirata the Astika-
parvan, the fifth sub-section of the Adi. (adhy. 13-53).

It will be noticed that from adhy. 4 to adhy. 12 of the Adi. a section
which, as already mentioned, is entirely concerned with the history of a
branch of the Bhargava clan, there is no mention of the Mahiabharata at all.
Nor is there, as a matter of fact, any mention of the epic in the immediate
sequel up to adhy. 53 of the Adi ! Only in adhy. 53, after having heard first
the Bhargava legends and then the story of the snake sacrifice (which had
been previously related by the Bhargava Pramati to his son Ruru), ^unaka
at last expresses the desire to hear the Mahabharata of Kr^ia Dvaipayana,
which v^as narrated to king Janamejaya by Vaisampayana in the intervals
of that snake sacrifice (1. 53. 32 f.) :

Mahdbhdratam dkyhdnnm Pdn^vdndm yasasharam j
Janamejayena yat prstah Krsna-Dvaipdyanos tada \ \
srdvaydmdse vidhivat tadd karmdntaresu sah |
tdm >aham vidhivat punydni srotum icchdmi vai kathdm j [

This completes our survey of the Bhargava, material in the Mahabha-
rata.^ But even this analysis does not give an adequate idea of the total
number of Bhargava references in the Great £63} Epic. The Bhargavas
regularly occur as static figures, along with other ancient sages, in the des*
criptions of martial combats, festive gatherings, state functions, council meet-
ings and all important assemblies. Outstanding incidents of their history
are frequently alluded to, briefly, even in the course of other narratives. The
names of their heroes are habitually introduced in similes and metaphors :
they are the standards of comparison iupamdna), to which everybody else
is compared, especially the epic heroes. Thus a man is praised by saying
that his intelligence is like that of Sukra. A waiTior is eulogized by saying
that in heroism he was the equal of the Bhargava Rama. Bhisma is once
praised by saying that he could not be defeated even by Rama. In other
places the valour and effulgence of Cyavana and Aurva are utilized for the
sake of a passing comparison. The devotion of Sukanya to her husband

1 The following sages should probably further be included among the Bhfgus :
( 1 ) a sage, mentioned several times in the Araijyaka ; a legend is told

about him in the Baladeva-tirthayStra (5alyaparvan) ; (2) G/tsamada, mentioned
briefly in the Anu^asana ; (3) Veda, who was the teacher of Uttahka and chaplain
of Janamejaya and Pau§ya ; (4) Paila, one of the pupils of Vyasa ; and (5) Math
davyay who curses Dharma in the celebrated story (updkhydm) of Animaijidavya
in the Adi. The part they play in our epic is small, and therefore they have been
ignored in this paper. Moreover, none of them, except Grtsamada, is actually called
a Bhargava in our epic. Sii-Kr^pa himstelf was distantly connected with the Bhar-
gavas, being a desteendant of Yadu, the son of Yayati by the Bhargava Devay-ani.

Cyavana has been made proverbial by constant citation. These details could
not be considered in the present paper for want of space.^

Retrospect

From the legends preserved in our epic it should seem that the Bhar-
gavas were a Brahmin clan, perhaps more intimately associated with the
ancient K§atriyas than most of the other Brahmin clans, being largely con-
nected with them by matrimonial ties. Thus Cyavana is said to have married
Sukanya, the daughter of king saryMi. Rqika had married Satyavati, the
daughter of king Gadhi of Kanyakubja and sister of the famous Visvamitra.
Jamadagni’s wife Renuka is likewise said to have been a princess by birth,
being a daughter of king Prasenajit of Ayodhya. The Bhargavi Dev^ayani
was moreover married to king Yayati : one of the very few pratiloma mar-
riages on record in Brahmanical literature." King Vitahavya had been adopt-
ed and made a Brahmin by a Bhrgu, and his descendants became Bhargavas.^
On the other hand some of the ancient Bhargavas seem to have come seri-
ously into conflict with the K§atriyas. The relations of Rama Jamadagnya
with the Ksatriyas are so well known and have been repeated above so often
that it is £64} unnecessary to dilate upon them here. But even in the case
of Aurva and Jamadagni, the epic has to relate conflicts with the Ksatriyas,
which have been alluded to above.

In these conflicts the Bhargavas are represented in our epic as irascible
sages, domineering, arrogant, unbending and revengeful. To our epic bards
they are at the same time omniscient and omnipotent. Supermen, who had
become so chiefly by virtue of their rigid austerities and the magical or spi-
ritual powers acquired by them. Owing to these occult powers, the Bharga-
vas were like gods walking on earth, or rather greater than mere gods.
Thus Bhrgu pronounces a curse on Agni — a god fervently lauded
and worshipped by the simple Aryans-— for no faults of his. He also cursed
(according to one version) Nahu:§a, who had been elected king of gods and
who had become arrogant and irreligious owing to this sudden elevation to
IX)wer. The wizard Cyavana paralyzed the arm of the recalcitrant Indra,
a high god of the Vedic Aryans. Jamadagni would shoot down the Sun,
another Aryan god. The Bhargava Uttahka, when about to curse 'Sri-Kr§'na,
the supreme god of the Bhagavatas or Vai^navas, was gently pacified by
the avdlara. The kings of the earth are of course like vermin before these
Bhargavas. The mighty Haihayas tremble before the infant Aurva, who
blinds them by his effulgence, and they have to beg for mercy on their bended
knees. King Kusika grovels at the feet of Cyavana and meekly submits to
all varieties of indignities for fear that the great sage might curse him.

1 Even these may be considered later, if a suitable opportunity presents itself.

EPIC STUDIES


Bhrgu, the eponymous ancestor of the Bhargavas, was one of the pra-
japatis. While the other prajapatis like Dak^a are said to have issued from
different limbs of Brahma, Bhfgu is represented as having sprung from
Brahma's heart, the noblest of the internal organs of man of god.^ In an-
other context in our epic, it is implied that Bhrgu was the greatest of the ma-
karris, though his name is not included even in the list of the famous Seven
Sages.

But the Bhargava most popular with our bards is surely Rama Jama-
dagnya. The bards love to dwell on his martial exploits, repeating them
whenever the slightest opportunity for it presents itself. The shadow of
this colossus overspreads the entire epic, excepting the short tale at the end
of the poem. In our epic he is not yet a full-fledged avatdra, but on the
high way to be ele-£65}-vated to that rank, surreptitious efforts being made
to make the epic document his divinity. He conquers the whole world, alone
and unaided ; such is the prowess of his fierce austerities. He frees the
earth of the burden of K§atriyas thrice seven times and makes the gift of
the earth to Kasyai>a, his priest, who divides it among Brahmins. Rama
fights even the enemies of the gods, with the same assurance and success,
enemies whom the gods themselves could not subdue. As the Bhargava
Rama is the perfect warrior {smvas^astrabhrtdm varah a phrase the bards
love to apply to him), three of the leading warriors of the Kaurava army—
Bhi§ma, Drona and Karoa — are said to have been initiated into the science
of arms by Rama Jamadagnya, though the latter according to the epic itself,
lived at the end of the Treta Age and the Kuru P^i>dava war took place at
the end of the Dvapara.

The epic contains a number of episodes {updkhydnas) relating to the
Bhargavas, such as, the Aurvopakhyma (Adi), Kartaviryopakhyana (Arai.i-
yaka), Ambopakhyana (Udyoga), Vipulopakhyana (;^nti), and Uttankopa-
khyana (Asvamedha), and so on. The entire Pauloma and a large section
of the Pau^ya two independent sub-parvans of the epic, are also devoted to
the legends of the Bhargavas. Besides these there are important discussions
and discourses attributed to some of the celebrated Bhargavas, such as the
Bhrgu-Bharadvaja-samvada, the Cyavana-Kusika-samvada and the Mar-
kai>deya-|samasya.

Another striking feature of these Bhargava legends in our Mahabh.^ 4 -
rata is the frequent repetition of these legends on different occasions in the
course of the epic. Thus the legend of Uttafika, the myth of the alterca-
tion between Cyavana and Indra, the story of Dropa’s obtaining weapons
from the Bhargava Rama, and the account of Karna’s pupilship under him,
is each told twice, in different contexts. The legend of the birth of Jama-
dagni and Rama is related in all four times. That the Bhargava Rama ex-
terminated the K§atriyas thrice seven times is mentioned ten times, in nearly

identical form {trihsaptakrtvali pjthivl krtd nif^kscUriyd purd, which appears
to have been a slogan of the bards) ; but the humiliation of the pride of
the K)§atriyas by the Bhargava Rama is mentioned about a score of times.

It is to be noted that the Bhargavas spring into this promi-£66}nence
all of a sudden in the Mahabharata. We look in vain for any reflection of
their phenomenal power and glory in the Vedic literature.^^ There the
Bhargavas are frequently alluded to as devoted to the fire-cult and they ap-
I^ear in the role of a group of ancient fire priests. They are said to have
procured fire for mankind. In the Battle of Ten Kings, the
Bhargavas are mentioned with the Druhyus. In many passages they are
associated with the Afigirases. The Atharvaveda is also known as BhrgvaiV
giras, and it seems certain that both the Bhrgus and the Angirases dabbled
a great deal in the black art and were feared on that account. That they
probably came into conflict with other clans and especially perhaps the K§a-
triyas is indicated by the fact that in the last-named Veda the name of
Bhrgu is chosen to exemplify the dangers incurred by those who oppress
Brahmins. The Siiijaya Vaitahavyas succumb as the result of an attack
on Bhrgu. 'The Aitareya Brahmaipa shows Bhrgu in a similar light.

Thus we see that the Vedic references give no ground for explaining the
eminence of the ancient Bhargavas implied by the epic account. These refe-
rences supply nevertheless rudimentary clues of ideas ahd sentiments which
were probably magnified in the imagination of the remote decendants of a
powerful ancient clan, influenced strongly by the cult of ancestor worship.
Thus, for example, the close connection of the Bhrgus with the fire cult may
ixirhaps serve to explain the part that Agni plays in many of the Bhargava
legends in the Mahabharata. The Cyavana-Asvins legend of the epic finds
some support in the statement of the Bgveda to the effect that the Asvins re-
juvenated Cyavana, making him “ acceptable to his wife and a husband of
maidens. ” The Brahmainas amplify this account. The connection of the
Bhrgus with the Atharvaveda explains the element of witchcraft in the
Bhargava legends of our epic, such as, for example, the revival of the dead
by the Bhargava Sukra, or the paralyzing of the arm of Indra by Cyavana
and of the creation of the monster called Mada, mentioned above. That tlie
Bhrgus had in some way championed the cause of Brahmins against other
clans is, as £67} already mentioned, supported by a reference in the Athar-
vaveda. Their intimate association with the Angirases implied in the Vedic
literature is reflected faithfully in many of the stories and genealogies of our
epic.

Taking a collective view of these Bhargava references in the Great Epic,
we cannot avoid the conclusion that the Bhargava heroes occupy a surpris-
ingly large portion of the canvas — ^which is said to depict the Bharata
War — ^filling up as they do much of the available space of the background.

EPIC STUDIES


And it is more than probable that if the epic is examined yet mqre minute-
ly, still further evidence of Bhargava material, hitherto undiscovered, will
be brought to light. Their myths and legends are uniformly distributed over
the entire extent of the Great Epic with the exception of some short and
unimportant parvans (10 and 15-18) at the end (comprising in all not more
than 2500 stanzas, a negligible fraction of the epic), books on vrtiich the aver-
age reader of the poem bestows but scant attention. The figures of the
Bhargavas have also been magnified to colossal proportions, painted with a
thick brush and in vivid colours. In short, the Bhargavas are represented in
our epic — ^the Mahabharata, the epic of the Bharata's or the epic of the
Bharata War— throughout as the people. How does that come about?—
** Cui bono ? as the Roman lawyer would have asked.

To imagine that all this fulsome eulogy liberally showered upon the he-
roes of the Bhargavas, and the interminable repetition of their stories and
legends are entirely unconscious — at least unintentional — ^and without any
ulterior motive, being just ordinary features of epic treatment, would be in-
deed naiVe.'^ In the first place, we have very clear and definite evidence of
the fact that our epic ha^ been consciously and deliberately expanded at
least in one instance : the surreptitious addition of a bunch of Bhargava
legends to the Kuru-Pajjdava epic in the shape of the so called Paulompar-
pan in the Adi which is entirely made up of Bhargava legends and has not
even the remotest intrinsic connection with the story of the epic.
Then we have equally clear and definite evidence of the tenden-
tious “ BhTguization of older l^ends, which occur in the epic itself in Iuh)
forms, one with and the other without some important Bh&rgava element, to
wit, the Stories of Sixteen Kings (Sodasarajikiya) and the Nahu§a-£68}
Agastya legend . We have also noticed that our Mahabharata contains t\\'o
variant openings, one of which is clearly inspired by a Bhargava,^ both for-

^ There isi only one explanation of the childish exaggeration and this repeated
mention on the annihilation of the Ki§atriyas by the Bhargava Rama. A deep
analysis of the motives underlying this (phenomenon) would suggest that these
fabrications are only a form of ‘over-compensation’, and endeavour to make the
Bhrgus feel important and * worth while’, after the disastrous blow to their ego-
ideals, It is the psychological revenge of the Bhrgus who were all but exterminated
by the K§atriyas. The slaughter of the Bhrgus admitted by the Bhrgus them-
selves in the Aurva legend deserves all the credence which unfavourable evidence
by a witness against one’s own self ordinarily does ; what the Bhrgus in turn (fid
to the K§atiiyas — namely, the annihilating the K§atriyas by Bhargava Rama 3X7
is known to us only from the account of the event from Brahmin sources. This
myth— the dream of the Bhrgus— is the sublimation of that intolerable inferiority
feeling . which had been repressed, but which was clamouring for expression.

? This was noticed by Holtzmann, Das Mahabharata, vol. 2 (1893), p.. 12.
'^Es liegt hier die Einleitung des Mahabharata der Bhargma vor, gerade wie im
Gesetzbuche des die Fassung der Bhargava sich eingedrangt hat”. He did

tunately preserved by the coinservative instinct of the redactors, helped by a
process of conflation peculiar to the Mahabharata, which tolerates a close
juxtaposition of discrepant versions. We have further indirect testimony of
the effort made to connect some Bhiargava or other with the proi>agation of
the epic. We are thus told that it was the Bhargava Uttahka who instigated
Janamejaya to undertake the snake sacrifice at which the Mahabharata was
first publicly recited. Our Astika is that tale which was narrated to the
Bhargava Ruru by his father Pramati. And last but not least, we must take
account of the very important fact that the Kulapati saunaka himself, be-
fore whom the Mahabharata is said to have been recited by the Suta Ugra^ra *
vas, was also a Bhargava ! So when Saunaka says that he wants to hear
the history of the Bhargavas before anything else (1. 5. 3) :

tatra vomsam aham pur v am hotum kchdmi Bhdrgavam |,
the reason for this peculiar predilection of the host of the Suta! is very evi-
dent.

But it might be contended that we are unnecessarily emphasizing the
Bhargava element ; that the Mahabharata was or has come to be an encyclo-
paedia of Brahmanic tradition and it therefore contains also all the Bhargava
legends — in a slightly exaggerated form perhaps. The epic itself says (1.
56. 33) :

yad ihdsti tad anyatra yan nehdsti na tat kvacit [

That is undoubtedly true, to a certain extent. One can, however, easily con-
vince oneself that the diaskeuasts who boldly conceived the colossal idea of
converting the popular Epic of the Bharatas into the Encyclopaedia Brah-
manica, though generally catholic in their selection of Brahmanic legends and
doctrines, and eclectic as regards their religious and philosophical outlook,
yet they {69} were probably not entirely without their preferences and pre-
judices, and that they do not apportion anything like the same amount of
space and breadth of treatment to the myths and legends of other Brahmanic
families such as the Agastyas, Atreyas, Kai^vas, K^yapas, Gautamas, Va-
si§thas, and so on. The legends of these other families or clans are by no
means entirely ignored in our Mahabharata, but they are comparatively few
in number and hardly ever repeated. They appear like negligible details
on the vast canvas of the epic and are easily lost sight of in this colossal
accumulation of apparently most heterogeneous elements, which are all the
same carefully balanced so as to produce a more or less homogeneous impres-
sion. Very differently treated are the Bhargava legends in our Mahabharata.
To make any impression by the side of the titanic figures of the old epic like
BhS§ma and Karrja, Krgpa and Arjuna, the Bhargavas had to be magnified a
great deal and their legends, which were probably not so well known then

sequel. '' Unser Mahdhkdrata/* he remarks, kehrt aber sofort wieder zur ander-

as now had to be repeated. And we accordingly find that the legends have
been repeated, so often that the redactors themselves must have in time come
to believe in them ; and the figure have been magnified, so liberally that
they app>ear almost to eclii>se the heroes of the Great Epic itself.

Just for the sake of contrast, we might compare the other great epic
of India, the Ratnayanja, for Bhargava references. That epic also is a Brah-
manic epic, containing a host of Brahmanic legends and stories.
The result of his quest for Bhargava’ references will astonish the
reader. The references are remarkably few and extremely meagre.
About our Bhrgu, a viMuti of :§ri“KT§ha» the only thing recorded in
the Ramayaija is that his wife was decapitated by Vi§nu ! Cyavana has
been introduced in Valmiki’s epic only to narrate some stories. The solitary
reference to our Rama Jamadagnya {&arvasastrabhrtam varah) has been no-
ticed above ; it is the one in which he challenges Rama Dasarathi and is
worsted in the encounter ! We learn nothing more about Jamadagni from
the Ram^yaiija than the bald fact that he was slain by Arjuna Kartavirya.
Aurva, who as an infant had blinded the Haihayas by his effulgence, is not
mentioned at all, so far as I know. Comment is superfluous.

£70} Now there can be no question that all this Bhargava material in
our present Mahabharata is entirely foreign to the plan of the original saga
of the Bharatas, occurring as it does almost wholly in the episodic portion
of the epic. There should foe, therefore, in my opinion no hesitation in con-
cluding that in our version of the Mohabhdrata there is a conscious — nay
deliberate — weaving together or rather stitching together of the Bhdrala le-
gends with the Bhargava myths.

The question how precisely this Bhargava element, which we find con-
centrated mostly in the updkhyasnaSy came into the cycle of the Bharata le-
gends is intriguing, but unfortunately the answer is largely a matter of spe-
culation. Even according to the traditional view, it was not the work of Vyasa,
the reputed author of the Mahabharata, because the diaskeuasts have been
fortunately frank enough to admit that his work, the Bharata, which originally
consisted merely of 24,000 stanzas, had no episode to speak of (1. 1. 61) :
caturvimsatisdhasrtm cakre Bhdratasamhitdm j
updkhydnair vind tdvad Bhdratam procyate budhaih i]

It could again hardly have been the work of Vaiiampayana, the direct
pupil of VyaSa, according to tradition, who is said to halve recited the Bha-
rata of Vyasa, in the presence of Vyasa himself, as he had been taught by
his guru, during the intervals of the short snake Sacrifice celebrated by king
janamejaya.

The case was different with the next recorded recitation of the Maha-
bharata : it was by the Suta Ugra4ravas in the presence of the Bhargava
Saunaka during the twelve-year sacrifice instituted by the latter (1. 1. Iff;
4. Iff). Even before the recitation commences, iSaunaka explicitly asks the

333


Suta who had come there to recite his Mahabharata, to narrate first of all the
history of the Bhargavas and, as directed by his host, the Suta obediently
does sq. There is a very clear shifting of the centre of gravity. Here
we have a different milieu and a. different interest. The scene changes from
the bustling and scintillating pageantry of the Kaurava Court to the reflec-
tive calm and leisure of the sylvan retreat of the Bhrgus.

Few scholars, I imagine, would now be inclined to deny that our epic
text has undergone momentous alterations in the course {71} of its long and
eventful history. It is now generally recognized that the Bharata, like the po-
pular lays, ballads and early epics of all countries and all people, has always
been a fluid text, adjusted to the varying needs of the occasion and the differ-
ing tastes of the audience. No disp>aragement or condemnation of the text is
thereby implied. The process is quite normal, inevitable and in a wider
sense wholly right. To continue to be a vital force in the life of a progres-
sive people, the epic must be a slow-changing book. The fact of expurgation
and elaboration is only an outward indication of its being a book of inspira-
tion and guidance in life, and not merely a book lying unused and forgotten
on a dusty book-shdf. And this is no drawback in the case of our text.
Therein lies on the contrary its capital interest and importance for us. It
is a rapid motion picture reel of many ages of Indian culture— not necessarily
factitive history — arranged in a naive fashion : something like the sculptured
panels on the gateways and the railings of the Buddhist Stupa at Sanchi or
the mural frescoes of Ajanta, with scenes telescoped all in one plane, without
much regard to perspective or perhaps with its own peculiar technique of pers-
pective.

As already remarked, it seems probable that in the formative period of
the epic a powerful Bhargava influence — direct or indirect — ^has been at work,
so to say behind the scenes, in shaping our epic for us. This element had
obviously obtruded itself upon the original nucleus, certainly after the time
of the original author Vyasa and probably after that of Vaisampayana. The
next traditional link, however, in the transmission of the epic is the Suta. Is
the Suta then responsible for the conversion of the Bhlarata into the Maha-
bharata ? Now I do not doubt that some of the Sutas probably were gifted
versifiers, able to compose ex tempore short bardic poems and to improvise
lays to suit them to the varying tastes and requirements of the audience.
But if we consider these Sutas capable of composing on the spur of the mo-
ment such masses of narrative episodes and didactic discourses as we find in
our Mahabhfirata, we shall be asking these minstrels with an accomplish-
ment far beyond their natural capacity. Nobody is, however, so credulous
nowadays as to imagine the Suta as the author of those extensive innovation
that must {72} have been necessary in order to convert a heroic poem of about
24,000 stanzas (taking the traditional figure as a rough guide for our spe-
culations) into an encyclopaedia, of the present dimensions.

EPIC STUDIES


We are not in any case, as far as I can see, constrained to accept every
single statement of the epic in its exact literal sense. And when I say that,
I mean no disparagement either of the text ; far from it. Our epic does not
pretend to be a dry, prosaic, matter-of-fact chronicle, nor a statistical history
in the modem sense, based upon a laboriously compiled critical apparatus.
If it were that, it would surely not have lived for 2500 years. We have on
the shelves of our libraries hundreds of ponderous tomes and compendiums
of national and world history, prepared along approved lines by laborious
professors of history. But hardly anybody reads these works twice, and they
are mostly forgotten, in a generation or two, by an understanding and un-
grateful posterity. The Mahabharata never was a scientific chronicle of that
type and it would be egregious folly to regard it as such. It is above all
an inspired poem. It was actually regarded by later generations as a kdvya :

krtam mayedam bhagavan kdvyam pammapujitam |, '
the highest type of Indian poetry, like its sister epic, the Ramayapa. It was
before everything else a work of art, creative art, idealistic in conception,
informed with deep religious feeling, permeated by a conscious didactic pur-
pose, focussed more on ideas and ideals than on facts and figures, in which
people were not interested then so much as now ; a work in which a moral
was conveyed by a parable, an elusive truth by a tangible facile myth. And
to the inspired creators of a traditional book of that type we must at least
allow poetic licence and common imagination.

The entire story that the Suta had heard the epic at its first recitation
by Vaisarhpayana and reproduced it verbatim at Saunaka’s bidding, having
committed it to memory after a single hearing, is so obviously unnatural and
improbable that it seems clearly more appropriate to regard it merely as a
poetic fiction, a “ frame-story,'’ the most popular of Indian devices of literary
composition. But there is no symbolism without a basis, however difficult
it may £73} be for us to reach the elusive subconscious or unconscious. To
my mind, the frame-story of our Mahabharata is directly an unconscious
admission of the fact that the Bharata had at a critical stage of its evolu-
tion passed into the sphere of influence of the Bhrgus, through the medium
of the wandering minstrel. The Bhargava influence is implied in the person
of the Kulapati Saunaka. The Snta, who u^ to recite the poem in the
Heroic Age, is kept on, with due regard to traditional usage, to give the new
recension a setting appropriate to it and indicating the source at the same time.

The influence of the Bhargavas in the narrative portion of the Great Epic
is very evident and can hardly be disputed. But their influence in an en-
tirely different sphere, though less tangible and therefore more difficult to de-
monstrate, is to my mind nevertheless probable : I mean the incorporation
into the epic of large masses of didactic material, concentrated chiefly in the
iSanti and AnuSasana, especially so far as it concerns the Dharma and Niti
elements. Though the philosophy of the Mahabharata is often times rather



EPIC STUDIES VI


335


shaky, being in places abstruse and confused, and though the religious be-
liefs which find expression there are perplexingly eclectic, oscillating between
Vai§iDavism and Saivism, between Henotheism and Pantheism, there can be
no two opinions about the fact that the Mahabharata offers a very sound and
complete exposition of Dharma and Niti according to Indiah theorists, a
feature which has given this vaierable old monument of Indian antiquity
its rank as Smrti and its abiding value and interest to the Hindus, nay to all
true children of Mother India.

Now it happens that Dharma and NJti are just the two topics in which
the Bhrgus had specialized and with which their names are prominently as-
sociated. The connection of the Bhargava Sukra with NIti, which is prover-
bial in the Mahabharata, is so patent that it does not need to be especially
pointed out. The connection of the Bhrgus with the Dharma^stra is perhaps
not so well known, but is nevertheless equally certain. One has only to re-
call that, according to a tradition preserved in the work itself, our Manusmrti,
the most famous and popular of ancient Indian works bearing on the Dhar-
ma^astra, is the ancient Code £74} of Manu in the form in which it was
communicated to mankind by Bhrgu and is therefore even commonly known
as the Blifgusamhita, an explanation which I see not the slightest reason to
question or doubt. It is also recognized that there is intimate connection
between the Mahabharata and the Manusmrti. The Manusmrti, it may be
pointed out, has an introduction not unlike in conception to the first chapter
of our epic : a few stanzas agree to some extent even in their wording. The
opinions of Manu have been frequently cited in our Mahabharata {ity evarh
Manur abravU). According to Buhler's computation, there are about 260
stanzas of the Manusmrti, that is nearly 10 per cent, of the total, which are
again found verbatim (or with only slight vari^ions) in parvms 3, 12 and
13 alone of the Great Epic.^ Then on the side of the Mahabharata, Dharma
is the foundation on which the whole stately edifice of the Great Epic has
been reared, and to a great extent also the material of which it is composed.
Our Mahabharata is itself a dharmOtgrantha. The putative hero of the epic,
Yudhi§thira is called Dharmaraja, himself a son of Dharma ; he is Dharma
incarnate. The Bharata was a dhcnma-yuddha : yato dhmmas tato jayab^
The field of battle was a dharma-k^etra. Narayana incarnated himself
as Si^-Kr^na to restore the fallen Dharma. The essence of the book {Bhdra-
ta^sdvitri), embodying the moral of the story, is given as (B. 18. 5. 62 f.) :

336 EPIC STUDIES

The infiltration of masses of Bhargava material in the shape of Bhargava
myths and legends, the manner of its treatment, ahd even that strange admix-
ture of the Epic with the Dharma and Niti elements, which latter especially
has so long puzzled many inquirers into the genesis of the Mahabharata,
thus appear to find a simple and straightforward explanation in the assump-
tion of an important umtrny dmkeuasis of the epic under very strong and
direct Bhargava influmce. But this does not at all £75} imply that the text
has remained untouched after this first diaskeuasis ; far from it. Like all
traditional works, it was a slow-changing book ; and additions and alterations,
as already remarked, must have been made in it continuously throughout its
long history of about 2500 years.^

These further additions were in the main probably made in the first ins-
tance by the Bhfirgavas themselves in the centuries that immediately fol-
lowed) the first important diaskeuasis under Bhargava supervision, since it is
most likely that just as the different collections of Vedic hymns, the various
Brahmanas and the ritualistic manuals were all, for some time, the closely
guarded property of diverse Vedic schools and families of sages, which had
respectively cultivated and developed them, so also our remodelled Bharata,
now elevated to the rahk of the Fifth Veda, must have remained for some
time in the exclusive possession of the Bhargavas as their close literary pre
serve. That would, in my opinion, account for the apparent homogeneous
character of this heterogeneous mass : it all came from different hands, but
out of the same mould.

If the above considerations have any validity, they might help us to lift
up a comer of the thick veil enveloping our Great Epic and allow us to have
a covert peep into its history. Such a peep would show that there existed
in India, in very ancient tim^ an epic poem of about 24,000 stanzas, attribut-
ed to Vyasa (the ‘‘Expander'’), which described in great detail the Bharata
War and sang the glory of the P5ji?,davas. This heroic poem, the Bharata,
which used to be recited by the Sutas mostly at royal courts and had in
course of time become very popular, was at a critical stage of its history ap-
propriated by the Bhrgus (who had certainly specialized in the Dharma and
NitiSstra and probably also developed leanings towards Vi^puism), with the
idea of developing the epic into a vdiide of jxxpular instmction and edifica-
tion combined with entertainment. Theste anchorites, full of age-old wisdom

and wonderful masters of the art of inyth-weaving, took from the Sutas the
Bharata and gave back to the world the Mahabharata, the same book yet
different. In the process of the redaction by the Bhrgus, the work, naturally
and to an extent unconsciously, received that characteristic and inddiWe
stamp £76} which was predetermined by the eventful history, the natural
proclivities, the special endowments, and the peculiar ‘‘ Weltanschauung '' of
the Bhrgus. It was this little episode in its history that necessarily gave cur
poem the anomalous character of an Epos and “ Rechtsbuch coimbined. It
may be surmised that this remodelled Bharata remained for some consider-
able time in the hands of the Bhargavas, who had developed it and so to say
re-created it, as their exclusive literary property, and they exploited it there-
after and propagated it in their own way. The colossal success of the Bhar-
gava recension of the ancient Epic of the Bharatas, a success which in one
sense was richly deserved, was the indirect cause of the neglect and subse-
quent disappearance of the original heroic poem, which probably still existed
at the time of the composition of the Asvalayana Grhya Sutra (3. 4. 4).“^
Like other branches of the hieratic literature, when the epic at last passed out
of the hands of the Bhrgus and became the common property of the literati
of India, it still remained a fluid text, not entirely closed to minor altera-
tion and expansion, but retained its character as a traditional work, revered
and cherished by the people as the work of Mahar^i Vyasa and serving still as
a vehicle of popular education, fiispiration and edification as intended by
the Bhrgus. The further we pursue the study of the traces of Bhiargava in-
fluence on the Epic of the Bharatas, the clearer, it seems to me, will become the
history of our Mahabharata, the Great Epic of Bharatavar^a.

## The Oldest Extant MS. of the Adiparvan

Introductory^

A discovery of capital importance for Mahabharata studies is the accident-
al but singularly lucky find by Manyavara Gurujiu Hemraj Panditjiu, c.i.E.,
D.P.I., the well-known savant of Nepal, of a new Nepali MS. of the Adiparvan,
which according to the Panditjiu is between seven hundred and eight hundred
years old, and therefore easily the oldest extant MS. of the Mahabharata. It
was only a few years ago that I had remarked in the “ Prolegomena ” to the
Adiparvan : “ Only those who know the difficulties in the way of obtaining
any MS. from Nepal will be in a position to appreciate fully the debt which
the editor and the other members of the Mahlabharata Editorial Board, and
beyond that the whole world of Indolc^sts, owe to the Rajaguru. {202^

Sankritists have much to hope for from the dispassionate efforts of this truly
patriotic and cultured Rajaguru, who loses no opportunity of placing his im-
mensef learning and unbounded resources freely at the disposal of all serious
workers in the field of Sanskrit research How prophetic those words have
proved and how the Rajaguru has more than justified our expectations, is
manifested in the recovery of this singular old Nepali MS.

The MS., of which complete collations and specimen photos (reproduced
here in facsimile^) were kindly sent to me for my use by Rajaguru Hemaraj
Panditjiu, was recently acquired by him and is in his possession. The mate-
rial is palm-leaf and the writing, which is throughout uniform, is in old faded
ink. It contains only the first parvan of the Mahabharata, but is complete
in itself, there being no folios missing. The average folio measures
2r' X 2i" and each folio contains uniformly 7 lines of writing, except the
last folio, which has only 4i lines. The MS. is not dated but the high anti-
quity claimed for it is authenticated, apart from its antique look,^ by con-
vincing internal evidence. The best proof is that it is almost entirely free
from those modem accretions which are given in Appendix I of the Adiparvan
Volume, as also in great part from those other smaller insertions which are
listed in the foot-notes. More astonishing still is the fact that out of the
textual emendoHons hazarded by the editor, fifty per cent, are actually docu-
mented by this MS. It is therefore no exaggeration to say that this remark-
able MS, opportunely affords welcome* support to the Critical Edition in most
crucial matters. Moreover many of the variant readings of the new MS. are
diiflicult and obscure, marking out its text as distinctly archaic. And, finally,
in many of its readings it agrees fairly closely with a certain other MS. from
Nepal, which is symbolized as in the critical apparatus of the Adi, and
which is agmn the oldest dated MS. of the the Adiparvan. The tradition is
therefore fairly complete and well attested.

{2031 greatest value of this MS. lies, as hintedl already, in its cor-
roboration of the constituted text of the Critical Edition. Indirectly it
attests and justifies, as an independent witness, ^the principles according to
which the reconstruction of the epic text is achieved, thus placing the consti-
tuted text on still surer foundaticwis.

Long Insertions of the Vulgate.

Hitherto, it may be observed, the data of the Sarada and the “ K ver-
sions had mainly to vouchsafe for the purification of thel epic text attempted

1 The photographs are of the written surface of the first and last folios and
two intermediate folios (one of which latter is the penultimate folio of the MS.).

^ I have compared the script with the specimens reproduced in BOhlER's
Paleographtsche Tafeln. It comes closest to the script of Tafel VI, No. XI (Cam-
bridge MS. No. 1691 , 2 of A.P, 1179 ).

in the Critical Edition. Now, the omissions of the constituted text are sup-
ported from a new source and from an entirely different version, the Nepali.
Our MS. is in fact surprisingly free from most of the matter pronounced to be
spurious on the evidence of the then available MSS. of different versKMis. The
longer insertions given in Appendix I, are conspicuous by their abseiKe in this
MS. Here is a list of the l(Mig passages which are missing in the new MS.

Short Insertions of the Vulgate.

Like these long insertions our MS. omits most of the short insertions
given in the foot-notes to the constituted text. There are more than two



340


EPte stitoiES


thousand of such passages, the majority naturally from the Southern Re-
cension. The following instances, selected at random, of “ short ” passages
omitted by our MS. may be mentioned for the sake of illustration : 128*, 220*,
250*, 301*. 313*. 402*. 429*. 463*. 528*, 558*, 560*, 564*, 573*, 693*,
756*. 892* , 1001*, 1036*, 1038*. 1129*, 1131*, 1188*. 1242*, 1308*, 1312*,
1330*. 1331*, 1341*, 1365*, 1368*, 1377*, 1379*, 1444*, 1477*. 1492*,
1494 *, 1503 *, 1515 *, 1516 *, 1517 *, 1686 *, 1729 *, 1742 *, 1793 *, 1824 *,
1847*, 2132*.

These, it may be noted, are some of the many passages (extending from
three to tw^ty lines) which are found in all N MSS. (except K) — ^with or
without some S MSS. — but which are omitted by our MS. The following
omissions from among these deserve special notice :

128* : This is a passage of 72 lines, consisting of the longer version
of the contents of the Arapyaka-parvan, found in certain MSS. of the North-
ern Recension. It may be noted in passing that in its Parvasaihgraha chap-
ter, the new MS. gives throughout the shorter version, which has been adopt-
ed in the Critical Edition and which agrees with the version of this adhyaya
in P. P. S. Sastri’s edition of the Southern Recension.

560* : By omitting this, our MS. omits the reference to Pandu, found in
all N MSS, except those of the Ka4nfira Version.

£205} 693* : This is a passage of sixteen lines and contains the famous
couplet na jatu kamah kamdndm etc., recurring in many places.

892*' : This passage, occurring after 1. 89. 51, is found in all N MSS.
In the place where it is inserted there appears to have been a lacuna in the
origimd, filled up by the two recensions in different ways. In the consti-
tuted text the place is marked by asterisks.

1036* : Details of Brhaspati’s cohabitation with Mamata, wife of Uta-
thya and the godharma mentioned in that context, inserted in all N MSS.
exc^^ tSj Ro-2 ^1.3.

1341* : A passage of ten lines found in all MSS. except Sj K. It des-
cribes the approch of Droua to Rama Jamadagnya for the astravidyS.

1793* ; A passage of sevai lines found in all MSS. except Tj Gi.e e M.

These significant omissions, major and minor, prove that the text of our
MS. is shorter than that of all other MSS. hitherto known. Accordingly we
find that in the Parvasaimgraha chapter of this MS. the figure of the stanzas
for the Adi is given as 7784, which brings down the figure of the Vulgate by
eleven hundred and the figure even of the iSarada MS. by two hundred
stanzas ! It is however, curious that it apparently has the same number of
adhyayas as the Critical Edition viz. 225, while the Parvasaihgraha figure
for) the same is 218 both in this MS. and the Critical Edition. In other
words in differing from its own Parvasaihgraha figure, our MS. exactly agrees
with the critical text ! The number of adhyayas in the Vulgate, it may be
noted, is 234, while tiiat of the Southern Recension can be computed to ex-



EPIC STUDIES VII 341

tend to about 250 adhySyas. On the other hand, the number of adhyayas
in the Kumbakonam edition reaches the astonishing figure 260 !

Small Infltralims.

Even though our MS. is appreciably shorter than any other MS. of the
Adi so far known, we cannot indeed suppose it to have been absolutely free
from inflation and contaminafion. This MS. has in fact just a few inser-
tions not countenanced by the Critical Edition. For instance :

{206} App. I, No. 12 : The first three lines of this passage (of sixteen
lines) are substituted in our MS. in place of 1. 19. 1-2. This substitution is
common to 5)3 also ! The passage is characteristic of all N MSS. except those
of the KasmSii Version.

App. I, No. 33 : This passage is found in all N MSS., the Kasmiri Ver-
sion showing variation only in sequence. The passage is inserted after 1.
56. 31, and is a continuation of the eulogy of the Mahabharata, serving as
    an introduction to that redaction of the epic which begins with the episode
    of Uparicara. Here our MS. agrees with in omitting lines 3-11.

App. I, No. 58 ; This passage also is a common heritage of all N MSS.
It describe how Surya, when invoked by Kunfi, presses her to have sexual
intercourse with him.

Besides these major additions, some insertions from the footnotes to the
constituted text have filtered their way into our MS. The number of such
passages is not very large, being about ninety, and they consist mainly of
single lines. These are the passages in question : 90*, 220*, 288*, 291*,
476*, 478*, 479*, 485*, 494*, 495*, 549*, 601*, 678*, 708*, 709*, 710*,
750*, 868*, 873*, 875*, 879*, 903*, 906*, 909*, 962*, 999*, 1004*, 1013*,

1017*, 1018*, 1022*, 1068*, 1087*, 1096*, 1104*, 1110*, 1120*, 1124*,

1141*, 1142*, 1144*, 1146*, 1148*, 1155*, 1162*, 1166*, 1173*, 1178*,

1186*, 1196*, 1212*, 1219*, 1224*, 1230*, 1240*, 1305*, 1309*, 1357*,

1430*, 1436*, 1463*, 1470*, 1623*, 1644*, 1665*, 1698*, 1786*, 1789*, 1796*,
1812*, 1815*, 1818*, 1855*, 1882*, 1883*, 1919*, 1920*, 1921*, 1922*, 1951*,
1953*, I960*, 1975*, 2016*, 2087*, 2097*.

All these insertions are uniformly met with in all N MSS., or at least in
the majority of N MSS., and not a single one of them is sporadic.

An insertion of a single stanza from the yaddsrausam section (adhy. 1)
is the only unique insertion in this MS.

Conflation of Mahdbharata texts.

Here we may note, in passing, the light this MS. sheds in an indired:
way (Ml how the text gradually gets inflated. At several places we find addi-
tions malde marginally by another and a later hand. For instance, after 1.
5. 26, we find a marginal insertion of two lines etc., which is

taken from a passage {207} of ei^t Tines f(Mind in all N MSS. (except Ko.i
Dj). Again, after 1. 19. 15 we have a marginal addition of two lines



342


EPIC STUDIES


etc., of which the first line is merely a variant of a line

included in our text, but the second is an additional ” line found chiefly

in late Northern MSS. of the Central Group. It is clear that the copyist of
such a MS. as this, without further investigation — which of course is not his
business ! — cannot determine whether the lines added in the margin belonged
to its origial exemplar, or whether they were taken from some other source.

It is not the custom of the copyist to be very squeamish about such things.

He copies whatever he finds before him, provided it makes sense and has
something to do with the epic. It is thus that the corpus has got gradually
inflated to its maxirrtum capacity. Cf. the example of cited in the Adi-
parvan Volume (Prolegomena, p. xii).


Minor Readings.

Let us now consider the individual readings of our MS. Here also the
agreement of this MS. with the constituted text is quite remarkable. That
it cannot and must not be expected to have complete agreement with the
constituted text is only obvious ; like all other Mahabharata MSS., it also
represents a particular version of the epic, and nothing more.

Our MS. shows in point of readings the greatest agreement with MSS.
of the Nepali group : quite naturally, as it is written in the same script and
belongs to the* same provincial version. In particular, its agreements with
the best and the oldest MS. of the Nepali version belonging to our appa-
ratus, are unique and striking. The total number of variant readings in our
MS. amounts approximately to a little more than 2500. Out of these’, its
unique agreements with N 3 (or in a few places along with one or two other
MSS.) against all other MSS, count over 500. This shows that our MS. de-
finitely belonged to the Nepali version, and is not a copy of a MS. of the
Sarada or ‘‘ K '' version — a. very important point — ^though it has marked
affinities in many a place with the latter groups. Here are appended about
sixty instances, chosen at random, as specimens of the agreements of

our MS. with

Here it is necessary to emphasise the curious circumstance that while the
new MS. is almost on a par with 1^,3 in* respect of individual
readings, it is far superior to N 3 in so far that it lacks about ninety per
cent, of the insertions which Rg has in comhion with the Vulgate, that is to
say, the Bengali-Devanagari group. It thus gives its welcome support to
the Saradia-K group and our Critical Edition as regards that large mass of
passages in which £209} these texts are lacking. It may be incidentally re-
marked that iSfg is relatively purer than the other two Nepali MSS. and occa-
sionally has definite leanings towards the iSarada or Kasmiri version. These
additional passages in MSS. like f^g, we may reasonably infer, were gradu-
ally added by the epic artists, who worked out the details and filled in the
lacunae of this colossal composition. There must have been a free give-and-
take of these passages in the extensive comparisons of different manuscripts
of the* epic text at holy places and centres of pilgrimage and seats of ancient
learning. Beginning in the lowly way of marginalia and sodkapatras, these
additions must have got embedded in the text, through their transmission
from copyist to copyist, undergoing in this process a strange variation of de-
tails.


In a small percentage of cases, our MS. shows, it must be admitted,
readings documented mostly by Southern MSS. — ^with or without support of
a few other N MSS. It is naturally the most difficult thing in the world to
decide in these cases whether this sporadic agreement is due to late contami-
nation or to primitive connection through the lost archetype. In the light
of such variants, some readings of the Critical Edition will have to be recon-



344


EPIC STUDIES


sidered, and it may, in sporadic cases, be found necessary even to alter slight-
ly the readings of the Adiparvan in the Critical Edition. That work must
however be left over now for further research by a future generation of
scholars.

Unique Readings.


Like all MSS. modern or ancient, our MS. has quite a large number of
unique readings, that is to say, readings which have not been found in any
MS. so far collated for the Critical Edition. They consist of variants of pro-
per names, consciously or unconsciously manipulated ; synonyms or paraph-
rases ; and sometimes of, mere transpositions of words and phrases ; or even
insignificant variants of expletives and verse-filling particles. In a few ins-
tances the variants are obscure and archaic, but generally weak and incon-
sequential as compared to the readings of the Critical Edition. The Maha-
bharata problem is made a problem of problems and a problem sui generis
by the amazing diversity of MSS. in all imaginable details ; and our MS. is
not £210} behindhand in liberally contributing to this diversity. Here I
specify a few samples of unique readings of the new MS. :

Our Emendations.

Now we may turn to what is perhaps the most surprising feature of our
MS. That is the support our MS. affords to the constituted text of the Cri-
tical Edition, with regard to the emendations attempted therein. It is re-
markable to find that this single MS., which is certainly older than any of the
MSS. we had before, supports and confirms, as already remarked, fifty per
cent of these emendations. Out of the total of thirty-six emendations £211}
made in the Critical Edition the following eighteen are corroborated by our
MS :


30.7 ^ ( hyper-

Now, even though these emendations were put forward more as a hypo-


thesis than as a dogma (Prolegomena p. xciv), they have evoked severe cri-


ticism from certain scholars. It will therefore be advisable to consider here


some of these criticisms in the light of the readings of our new MS.

Professor A. B. Keith, in his review^ of the Adiparvan, admits that,
“ the editor has quite justly relied often on the maxim that the more difficult
reading is to be preferred to the simpler, since it is easy to explain the latter
as correction of what was poorly understood by careless scribes ”, but con-
tinues, we need not, therefore, accept as a necessarily correct theory the view
that we are to restore hiatuses, whenever we find variants in the MSS., which
might be explained by assuming that they are the different efforts made by
scribes, who were not accustomed to hiatus to remedy the irregularity”.
Whether the said view represents a correct theory of Mbh. text-reconstruc-
tion or not may be best judged from the circumstance that out of the eighteen
emendations which are actually documented and attested by this new MS.,
not less than thirteen were made just on the ground of £212} hiatus ! A
glance at the above list will convince the reader of the truth of this contention.

EPIC STUDIES


In all these thirteen instances there are violent fluctuations in the MS.
readings. These uncommon fluctuations pointed towards the possibility, which
this MS, has turned, into a certainty, that they represent more or less inde-
pendent attempts at correcting some solecism to which the scribes, editors or
commentators would naturally take violent objection. It is natural to infer
that this solecism is thej hiatus to which a steadily increasing antipathy is
noticeable as wd pass from the earlier to the later Sanskrit literature. It is
well-known that Vedic texts frequently contain hiatus which does not cause
any serious offence to the susceptibilities of the tnodem reader, but the same
hiatus in the work of a poet of the classical period would be rated as a capi-
tal blunder. The view of Hopkins (which Prof. Keith endorses) to the
effect that there is nothing peculiarly epic in hiatus, and that it is found in
precedent and subsequent poetry, is quite non-committal, and, if anything,
favours our position. The point at issue is the legitimacy of the hiatus in
the subsequent literaturq and not merely its occurrence. It is quite legiti-
mate in the earlier literature, but comes to be progressively regarded as a
solecism and therefore is an anthema to scribes bred and brought up in the
classical tradition. It is no doubt carelessness only, as Prof. Keith observes,
in the later stages of the growth of Sanskrit literature, but not necessarily so
throughout its history. Prof. Keith himself has not much faith in his own
scepticism and consequently much of his criticism loses point, as he concedes,
though reluctantly, the validity of certain restorations of hiatuses.-

Prof. Keith has altogether missed the significance’ of the variation of
MSS. between particles like, hi, ca, tu, vd, in these instances of emendations.
It is true that these particles show great variation from MS. to MS., as is
only natural in the corpus of a fluid text. But the scribes did not go out of
their way to vary the text and to replace deliberately one particle by another.
Often enough these small particlds are very instructive in determining the
complex relationship of MSS. Our present MS for instance, agrees with
55^3 scores of times in the choice of just {213} these particles against all other
MSS. But we need not press the point too far. It is sufficient to note that
the variation is not as arbitrary as it might at first sight appear. Moreover,
it is easy to undeTstand that these small particles do come in very handy
whenever the question of avoiding a hiatus arises and can be sandwiched
between the vowels without disturbing tfie metre.^ This is clearly the sim-
plest and most natural mode of avoiding the hiatus and explains the violent
fluctuations of the text. That it is not the only mode of avoiding the seem-
ing blunder hiay be seen from 1. 57. 20 kriyate ^*ucchrayo ntpaik, where T G
have entirdy recast the pada, changing it to : kurvanty ete dhv<ijocchrayam.


1 Cf. Hopkhns, The Great Epic, p. 199 f. : “ In both metres, to avoidUfttus,
irrational particles are often inserted. A good example is : purS krta5mge tata hy
asid laja hy Akampanah, vii, 2,029, where B., 52, 26, omits the first hi



EPIC STUDIES VII , 347

So the proof of an original hiatus does not always rest upon a mere variation
of particles, as Prof. Keith thinks.

Prof. Keith starts from the conviction (which is quite a priori), that
if at all a hiatus occurs, it must occur either between the padas where the
absence of sandhi is natural ; or else before a vocative, where it is easy to
feel a natural pause. He doefe not grudge the restoration of hiatus in 1. 99.
15 ; 103. 5 ; 110. 20 ; 119. 11 etc. on these grounds. In 1. 57. 20 kriyate
"^'ucehrayo nrpaih and 1. 100. 2 nisUhe dgamisyati, he haltingly admits the
validity of the restoration of hiatus and tries desperately to defend it on
grounds of metrical facility. He is adamant, however, when it comes to —
what he styles — unmotived hiatus. He has exemplified his scepticism in
the following instances.

In 1. 147. 2 he considers roramthas tv mdthavat as more legitimate.

Proceeding further, Prof. Keith says that it is very difficult to believe in
1. 207. 17 kule asmin habhuva ha : since such a hiatus as this is “ unmotived
        He can, however, easily persuade himself to believe that “ the sambabhuva
        of a large body of MSS. was erroneously curtailed to babhuva with the result
        that kule '^smm had to be extended ” !

In 1. 119. 11 tathty ukte Ambikayd, the position according to Prof.
Keith is uncertain ” ; tv may be right before Ambikayd,

£214} In 1. 98. 8, antarvatm aham Bhrdtrdi may be explained, in the
opinion of Prof. Keith, by emphasis ; but it is quite probable, he adds,
that “ tv is original, ty would be a blunder for it and hy a correction

1. 224. 5, samtapyamdnd abhito is quite ‘‘ needless according to Prof.
        Keith. The MSS. suggest, according to him, samt\apyamdmn as “clearly
        correct “ Misunderstanding of the accusative we are told, “ as follow-
        ing on the previous line has led to the mere corrections samt\apyamdnd bahu-
        dhd or purato

In 1. 157. 13, pahcakrtvas tvayd uktaJi ** seems unmotived and the vari-
ants of the MSS. hardly justify it

Prof. Keith calls 1, 110. 28, yadi dvdm mahdprdjna, “very dubious”,
and in 1. 51. 8, atho Indral} svayam evdjagdma according to him is “ not at
all certain ”.

1. 214. 9. is an interesting case. The pada in dispute reads Dharmardje
           *atipfityd, which is an emendation. It was first criticized by the late Prof.
           WiNTERNiTZ as being “ really unnecessary ”. A reply was given to his cri-
           ticisms in these Annals by me and I have devoted three pages of the journal
           (vol. 16. pp. 108-110) to explain the circumstances which, in my opinion,
           necessitated the emendation. Prof. Keith was left unconvinced by these
           arguments. Rejecting this explanation, he dogmatically lays down : “in 1,
214. 9, Dharnmdje hy atipAtyd should be read ; the variant tv is normal,
     and the hiatus is unmotived ”,

Now that most of these unmotived, needless, dubious, illegitimate, un-

necessary hiatuses are actually documalted and are no longer merely my con-
jectures, I am intrigued to know what hidden motives Prof. Keith will dis-
cover in them in order to explain their occurrence in an authentic MS. in the
possession of the Rajaguru of Nepal.

It is( sad that Professor Winternitz should not have lived to see some
of his doubts about the readings of the constituted text finally dispelled by
the evidence of this MS. The discovery of this valuable MS., so consequent-
ial for the text-criticislm of the Adiparvan, would certainly have delighted the
heart of this veteran scholar, who took a passionate and life-long interest in
epic studies. The text of the Critical Edition objected to in the £215} fol-
lowing places by thd late lamented Professor Winternitz is supported by


our MS.

## The Rama Episode (Ramopakhyana) and the Ramayana

Sluszkiewicz’s elaborate dissertation^ on the recensions of the Rema-
yaoa has revived the interest in the question of the relationship between
the Ramayaija and the Rama Episode of the Mahabharata, a question
which appears to have been first mooted by Weber.^ Weber had contented
himself with formulating the four logical alternatives : (1) the Ramopa-
khyana is the source of the Ramayaipa ; (2) the Ramopakhyana constitutes
an epitome of the Ramayaiia, but of a Ramayajiia more primitive than the
epic in its present form ; (3) the Ramopakhyana represents an epitome of
the Ramayana, but an epitome nxxlified somewhat by the compiler of the
Episode himself ; and lastly ; (4) the two poems are derived independently
from a lost common source. The alternatives worked out by Weber may
be admitted ; but then logical possibilities, unfortunately, do not carry us
very far in historical investigations.

Jacobi, who has dealt with the question at great length in Das Rama-
ya^a, Geschichte und Inhalt (Bonn 1893), held firmly to the opinion that
the Ramopakhyana was based on the Ramayaiia, on our Ralmayana, on the
Rama Epic as we have it, — the episode forming a rather careless abridgment

of Valmiki’s epic (op. cit. p. 70). In discussing the question he has drawn
attention to certain passages in the Ramopakhyana which presuppose a
knowledge of the Ramayana, and which would be indeed unintelligible if
the reader did not know certain facts and circumstances which were detailed
in the Epic but omitted in the Episode. This argument {473} seems to be
not quite as sound as it appears at first sight ; because, for the allusions
in question, the compiler of the Episode might haVe been indebted to any
other source or sources which likewise contained those explanatory allusions
which happen to be omitted in the Episode. The allusions do not point
unequivocally to any one single definite source.

But Jacx)BI did not of course base his case on this fact alone. He
strengthened it from another side. He pointed out (op. cit. pp. 72 ff.) about
a dozen pa!ssages which the Episode had in common with the Epic. These
parallelisms carry naturally far greater weight than the allusions mentioned
above. Exact verbal agreement between the works of two poets, even though
they may be working on the sa!me theme, are always suspicious. The
human mind is not easily duplicated. Sinular ideas may arise independ-
ently : but the words in which they become clothed are still something per-
sonal and characteristic, varying with each individual.

Jacx>bi attached special importance to one particular stanza in the
Episode,-— a veritable doggerel which, (according to Jacobi) was evidently
a copy of the perfect Ramayaipa stanza — once heard never forgotten

The Mbh. caricature of this stanza, according to Jacobi, was :

Jacobi was of opinion that this statiza of inferior form proves borrow-
ing because it is inferior. This unquestionably proved also, Jacobi argued,
that the Episode is merely an epitome of our Ramayania. The argument
is again not quite conclusive, and the point has been contested by Hopkins.
“ A great poet/’ says Hopkins, “ is more apt to take a weak verse and
make it strong than is a copyist to ruin a verse already excellent” (Gteat
Epic, p. 63). Whatever the merits of this latter contention, Jacobi’s con-
clusion appears to be correct in the main, though his argument is certainly
fallacious. Jacobi should have stopped short with the stanza. The Maha-

bharata stanza appears to be — ^and very probably is — a weak £474} imita-
tion of the Ramayaina stanzal. The fallacy lies in the extension that the
Ramopakhyana is therefore a weak imitation of the Ramayaaja. The rela-
tion between the two stanzas does not necessarily prove an 5 dhing about the
relationship between the Ramayana and the Ramopakhylana as u/iholes.

WiNTERNiTZ^ has already warned us that each stanza of The Mbh. must
be judged on its own merits, — it may be added, whm we wanti to use^ the
stanza for historical and compctraiive purposes. We could not find a better
example of this dictum than the stanza on which Jacobi has relied for
establishing the posteriority of the Ramopakhyana. The stanza has an
intricate history. Though found in all our old printed editions, the MS.
support for it is surprisingly meagre. Of the two lines comprising the stanza,
the second was found only in Bengali MSS. in addition to some stray Nagari
MSS. ; but the first line is itself known in two variant versions ! The form
known to and cited by Jacobi, namely,




alternates with alnother :




which appears to be an attempt at remedying the awkwardness of thei for-
mer, which was the subject of Jacobi’s strictures.^ Both lines are however
completely missing in Kaimlrt and Southern MSS, {besides many old Nagari
MSS .^) ! This fact leaves no room now for doubting that the stanza in
question is but a very late addition to the Great Epic. It can therefore
naturally prove nothing whatsoever about the age or the character of the
original Episode to which it has been secondarily alppended by a recent
interpolator. All disquisitions based on this stanza from the Ramopakhyana
have consequently become futile. We must look for other criteria.


This only shows how very precarious are the conclusions that are based
on the Vulgate text of the Mbh, And it is very remarkable that many of
those very passages that have been used in the past lot literary-historical
purposes have turned out to be unhappily but also unquestionably spurious.^

section, nay sometime of each angle verse, must be determined separately, ...”

H. Oldenberg to illustratel his Akhy^a theory. It is well known that Oldenberg
always maintained that the oldest foim of epic poetry in India wa^ a mixture of
prose and verse, the speeches being in verses, while the events were narrated in
prose. In this coimection he drew attention to the story of Sibi in the Vanaparvan

(475} However the fact that one pairticular stanza cited by Jacobi has
turned out to be unauthentic does not affect his gaieral conclusion about
the relationship between the Ramop^yiana and the Ramayana which, in
my opinion, is quite wdl-founded and can be supported on other grounds.

As far asi I cata judge, the minute differences in the details of the story,
which have been pointed out and exaggerated by some critics of jACOBrs
theory, tell us nothing whatsoever about the matter which is the subject of
discussion. The verbal agreements have, on the other hand, an unusually
great probative force. To strengthen the case of Jacobi, we need therefore
a large nuirber of agreements, I had this fact in mind when I was stud 5 ring
the Ramopakhyana for my edition of Vanaparvan or — ^to give it its correct
name — ^AraDyakapaWan.

Jacobi had found just twelve concordances. They are obviously too few.
But their actual number should be very much greater, even if we exclude
the epic iterata and standing phrases, which are the comimon heritage of the
epic bards and which have been listed separately by Hopkins in an Appendix
to his Great Epic, It would be premature, it seems to me, to discuss the
question which of the existing versions of the Ramiayaii>a our Episode stands
closest to. That question can be taken up only when we have a really criti-
cal! edition of the Ramayaija, which is promised by my friend and colleague
Professor Raghu Vira of Lahore from his International Academy of Indian
Culture. In the meantime, I shall just register the concordances which I
have been able to find, irrespective of the versions of the Ramayapa to
which they may belong.^ A scholar who knows his Ramayajoa better
than I do would naturally be able to handle the question with more com-
(476}petence and find more concordances. But in the absence of such an
exhaustive study by a savant who has mastered both the poems, the follow-
ing table which I have prepared may be found useful. I have consulted
only the Bombay edition (published in 1888 by the Nimaya Sagar Press)
and Gqrresio’s edition (1843-1867). Of the latter edition, moreover, the
last volume (Uttarakaijda) was not available to me and therefore could
not be utilized.


bharata, p/ 23) regarded as a survival from the oldest form W our great epic can
now on manuscript authority be proved to be one of the latest interpolations in
the epic. We are not concerned with the date of this passage. The passage may
jbe of hoary antiquity — ^though I doubt it personally — , but it certainly never formed
a part of the Oldest strata of the Mahabharata : that much we can xk>w say with
confidence. * One sees how even a scholar like Oldenbeko can make abysmal
blunders in the estimarion of the age and character of passages of the Mah^bhkratav

This cannot be considered as an exhaustive list.^ In fact I must 
frankly confess that my study of the Raniayaioa has been rather {487} per- 
functory, and moreover it is difficult to identify passages in a work like the 
Ramiayana’ in the absence of a verse-index. A closer study of the Epic and 
Episode, I am confident, would result in the tracing of many more paraWhsm^ 
in diction and phraseology. I must here add that I have intentionally ex- 


^ In the above list Nos. 5, 8, 23, 31, 79 and 82 were traceable to the Bombay 
ed. only ; Nos. 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 19, 26, 33, 37, 41, 44, 53, 66, 74, 75 and 81 were 
traceable to Qoirresio^s edition only ; while the remaining 64 are common to the 
two editions of the Ramayaagia . — En passant I may add that even from these figures 
one can see that text of Gorresio's edition is nearer to the Critical Edition of the 
Ramopiakhy&ia than that of the Bombay Edition of the Ramiya^a^ a tondurion 
which is confirmed by the numerous agreements in individual readings between 
and our text as against the tradition represented by the Bombay text,

EPIC STUDIES 


eluded such passages as show merely parallelisms in ideas, and I have strictly 
confined myself to exact verbal similarities. The greater the number of such 
verbal similarities the weaker becomes the case for Hopk^s. He, relying 
on the many minor differences in detail, argues that the fact that the subject- 
matter of the Epic and the Episode is^treated differently in several particulars 
points to different workings-over of older matter rather than to copying or 
condensing'* (Hopkins, op. cit. p. 63). Hopkins loses sight of the fact that 
differences like those pointed out by him do not prove anything in such cases. 
Differences are! natural and may be expected ; nay, they could scarcely be 
avoided — as far as I can judge— when one is condensing a work of about 
26,000 stanzas. But ajgreements in the bulk can never be casual or acci- 
dental ; they show invariably identity of source. And the source, as already 
pointed out by Jacobi,^ was not a manuscript of the Ramayaina, but a memo- 
rized version of it, current in the time of the adapter and in his locality. Then, 
I expect, the compilers of such works could hardly avoid the influence from 
oral tradition which existed then. In this restricted sense we nxist under- 
stand the statement that the Ramopakhyana is an epitome of our Ramayana, 
a fact which we may regard as established on account of the numerous verbal 
agreements which have been shown to exist between the two poems.*
