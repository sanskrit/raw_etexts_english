title = "nakShatra homa as per the kAThaka yajurvedins"

+++
The nakShatra homa as performed by the taittirIyaka-s utilizes the famed
nakShatra-sUktaM and the elaborate mantra prescriptions from from the
taittirIya brAhmaNa (3.1). The kaTha-s have a very different tradition
of nakShatra homa. With the denudation and extinction of the kaTha
tradition this appears to have been lost, but we can reconstruct it in
large part due to the commentary of the kaTha ritualist devapAla.
devapAla was in the line of great kaTha yajurvedins from like: 1)
gauradhara the R^ig/yajur dvivedI from Kashmir who composed a now lost,
but supposedly notable, commentary on the kAThaka saMhitA known as
veda-vilAsa. 2) lakShmIdeva, a noted performer of shrauta rituals and 3)
Adityadarsha. devapAla appears to have been one of those last great
brahmin scholars who was intimately acquainted with the rituals of the
kaTha tradition and he describes the denudation of brahminical tradition
around him. While by all accounts he was smArta, in terms of tantric and
laukIka disposition he was inclined towards the Kashimirian lineage of
pA\~ncharAtra mantra-shAstra and even composed a great stava on viShNu.
In terms of philosophical affiliations he belonged to the yoga school
and composed a scholarly commentary on the sUtra-s of pata\~Njali. At
the same time his work clearly shows that he was a master of the mImAMsa
school. He was born in Jalandhar, Panjab, to a vedic scholar haripAla
son of bhaTTa upendra. He wrote his great work on the laugAkShi kalpa
sUtra-s in jayapura near Shrinagar, Kashmir.

The offerings are made in the shrauta context as puroDAshas on 8
kapAla-s or in the aupAsana fire as charu-s of rice or barley. The
mantras used for the oblations are completely different from those of
taittirIya tradition (some of them have readings unique to the kaTha
tradition different from those found in the taittirIya brAhmaNa or
saMhitA. While I have gathered all these distinct mantra-s due to the
effort of keying in I will for now stick to pratIka-s):

27 or the 28 nakShatra-s have the same deities as in the nakShatra homa
of the taittirIyaka-s. The only exception being mR^igashIrSha which is
presided by soma in the taittirIya tradition whereas the kaTha-s
attribute it to the maruts. The kaTha-s rather than compose new mantra-s
as in the taittirIya tradition instead resorted to culling mantras for
the presiding deities from various preexisting collections. In most
cases their choice is a proper, except in the case of ahirbudhnya,
where, probably due to the lack of a proper mantra, the redactors were
forced to chose one which just had the word ahi in it.
