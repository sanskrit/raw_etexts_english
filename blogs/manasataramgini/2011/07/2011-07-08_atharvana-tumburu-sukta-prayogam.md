+++
In the AtharvaNa tradition after having learned the mantra-s of the
nIlarudra sUkta one learns the tumburu sUkta. The sUkta of tumburu (AV-P
20.61.8-9; 62.1-6) goes thus:  
na tatra bhavo hanti na sharva iShum asyati |  
yatra tvaM deva tumburo parvateShu virohati ||  
kR^iShyAm anyo virohati girer anyo.adhipakShasi |

vR^iShabhasyeva kanikradato R^iShayaM shamayAmi te ||  
saM mA si\~nchantu marutas saM vAto rohiNIr uta |  
saM mAyam agnis si\~nchatu prajayA cha dhanena cha ||  
dIrgham AyuSh kR^iNomi te naktaM harI mR^igayate |  
divA suparNA rohitau bhavAya cha sharvAya chobhAbhyAm akaraM namaH ||  
vishalyasya vidradhasya vAtIkArasya vAlade |  
bhavAya cha sharvAya chobhAbhyAm akaraM namaH ||

During prayoga one first recites the vAmadeva mantra from the
pa\~nchabrahma series. Then he installs the fire on the sthaNDila as per
the tradition of the atharvan-s. There after reciting the tumburu sUkta
make oblations of drumstick and tumburu saMidh-s dipped in ghee.

Then he makes the four bhaginI yAja-s of ghee with AV-P 20.21.6:  
udojiShThAM sahasyAM jayantIm aparAjitAm |  
lakShmIr yAH puNyAH kalyANIs tA asyai savitaH suva ||

Then he stands under the tumburu tree and offers tarpaNA-s to tumburu
with the above sUkta and the bhaginI-s with the above mantra (x 4). He
may then prepare the secret tumburu drugs.

This sUkta is of considerable importance for multiple reasons:  
1\) It helps understand the origin of the central deity of the
vAma-srotas, tumburu rudra. Most modern Hindus unacquainted with the
shAstra-s of the vAmasrotas are not familiar with this once popular
system. Hence, tumburu to them usually stands for the commonly known
gandharva, who is frequently mentioned in the rAmAyaNa and the
mahAbhArata. However, the evidence for a well developed worship of
tumburu as the deity of the vAmAsrotas is apparent from number of texts.
The viShNudharmottara suggests that he was being worshiped with his four
sisters in the gupta era. The worship of tumburu and his sisters is also
attested in the nAstika ma\~njushriya mUlakalpa and a fragmentary Gilgit
manuscript discovered by SDV. An early jaina yantra the vardhamAna vidyA
has taken up the chaturbhaginI and replaced tumburu with the jina. His
worship appears to have been fairly widespread in Asia, even if
scattered, till around the middle of the 1200s. After that it has
largely declined and only maintained within the srotAmsi shaiva krama.
Nevertheless, the origin of the tumburu as an emanation of rudra was
rather poorly understood, given the apparently older presence of tumburu
the gandharva with whom he shares a penchant for music. The AV-P sUkta
shows that the origin of the connection between tumburu and rudra is a
much older one than the classical vAmasrotas texts and might have even
predated the eponymous gandharva.

While the musical connection of tumburu is not apparent in the veda,
there are other links which establish a continuity with the deity of the
vAmasrotas. In the veda tumburu is a sylvan form of rudra associated
with cures against diseases, which is an ancestral trait of the
Indo-European rudra-like deities. Indeed, this trait is stressed in the
vAmasrotas, where rituals to tumburu and the chaturbhagini are stated as
being a counter to disease.  
e.g.:  
muchyate cha sadA rogair mR^ityurUpair durAsadaiH || VT 92cd

shatajapto jalenApi tato vA muchyate sadA |  
vyAdhighAta samidbhis tu vyAdhinAtyantapIDitaH ||  
aShTottara shatenaiva AhutInAM na saMshayaH |  
kShIrAktena tu deveshi rogI rogAd vimuchyate || VT 183-184

Further, in the AV-P the tumburu hymn occurs in the larger context of a
number medical applications, including the administration of the
oShadhi-s for the treatment of tertian malaria. This is reminiscent of
the kashyapa saMhitA where rudra is invoked before treatment of malaria.
Thus, it is clear that the worship of tumburu rudra has an hidden
history from the AV period, with the shaiva AtharvaNa tumburu prayoga
vidhAna establishing the link with the vAmasrotas.

The tumburu tree

2\) This AV-P allusion offers the first reference to a celebrated dyad
of plants that rise to considerable prominence in classical Hindu
medicine- tumburu and shigru. The use of samidh-s from the tumburu tree
are well-known in the early atharvavedic shaiva tradition: The
uchChuShma kalpa of the AV parishiShTha-s (AV-par 36.4.2) mentions the
use of these samidh-s in uchChATana rituals. But the use in the AV-P
text is clearly of a medical nature. This may be compared to the
nighANThu sUtra-s regarding these plants in classical Hindu medicine
where they often occur together:  
tumburuH pitta-kR^id vAta-kR^imi daurgandhya nAshanaH |  
shigrus tIkShNa laghur grAhI vahni-kR^it kapha-vAtajit |

Thus, the tumburu plant is described as being an augmenter of pitta,
destroyer of parasitic infestation, a suppressor of bad body odor and a
counter for the vAta. The shighru plant is described as “light”,
“sharp”, a constrictor of the gut, an augmenter of digestion and a
counter to kapha and vAta. It is interesting to note that in classical
medicine these plants are both described as counters to vAta. This
should be seen in light of the term “vAtIkAra” in the tumburu hymn – it
appears that there was an ancient connection between the prescription of
these plants and problems of “vAta”, even-though the tri-humoral theory
was hardly accepted in its classical form in atharvanic medicine. There
is no doubt that both these plants appear to have considerable promise
in medicine. The nutritional value of the drumstick is well-known.
However, it would be of particular interest to further develop certain
key compounds from this plant: moriginine, spirochin and niazimicin.
Likewise, several compounds from tumburu like tridecanonchelerythrine,
conifegerol, canthin-6-one, asarinin, dictamnine and skimmianine are of
potential interest.
