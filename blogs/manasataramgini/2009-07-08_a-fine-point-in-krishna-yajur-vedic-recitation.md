For a general account of vedic accents and their oral rendering one
might refer to the following: [vaidika
svara-s.](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/09/01/a-practical-guide-to-vvedic-svara-s-in-recitation/)

The recitation of the R^igveda, the vulgate atharvaveda and kANva shAkha
of the shukla yajur veda follow a generally similar pattern over much of
bhArata-varSha. The nambuthiri-s of the chera country, especially while
reciting the RV follow a highly derived set of rules that are
encountered nowhere else. The widespread mAdhyaMdina-s and the Orissan
paippalAda-s have largely lost the original svara-s and have only a
pseudo-intoned recitation. The common pattern of the RV, the AV-vulgate
and kANVa-SYV (not their shatapatha brAhmaNa) is the elongation of all
long vowels and anunAsika consonants with associated svarita-s. Further,
all these traditions render short vowel svarita by raising the pitch and
exaggeratedly stressing the vowel. A deviation from this latter trend in
short vowel svarita-s is only encountered in the R^ivedin-s from the
mahArATTa country. In evolutionary terms the general pattern shared by
these recitations appears to be the ancestral state of the rendering of
the vedic text (contra what some white indologists and their fellow
travelers had mistakenly thought it was).

The kR^iShNa yajur vedic recitations that survive (taittirIya and
maitrAyaNIya) or survived until recently (kaTha) differed from the above
in that they do elongate all svarita-s with long vowel or anunAsika-s.
They only elongate long vowel svarita-s if they occur next to a
consonant. They also elongate the ‘M’ anunAsika next to a daNDa. But
there are some fine points in these rules.  
Rule 1: If a consonantal is at the ‘n’ at the end of word, and is
preceded by a long vowel bearing a svarita, and is not generated by or
engaged in a saMdhi, then it shall merely be rendered in a high pitch
with a distinctive stress. It shall NOT result in elongation of the long
vowel bearing the svarita.  
However, if the consonantal ‘n’ is inside a word or linked in saMdhi
then it shall cause the long-vowel bearing a svarita and preceding it to
elongate.  
udAharaNaM:  
The following long vowel svarita-s in bold are not elongated but the ‘n’
after them stressed and raised in pitch:  
…pibato ja**nA**n | (shata rudrIya last anuvAka)  
An interesting case is when it is at the end of a word but not end of a
sentence:  
praghAs**yA**n havAmahe…(inTS1.8.3)  
However, the following long vowels in bold with svarita-s are
elongated:  
sa ya e***Sho***.antar hR^idaya AkAshaH | (in TU 1.13; svarita on Sha is
due the abhinihita clause in the saMdhi between eSha and antar which in
the KYV is rendered like a regular dIrgha svarita rather than as a kaMpa
as in the RV or AV)  
***se***ndra yoniH | (in TU 1.13; here the consonantal n is inside a
word).

In the KYV consonantal ‘n’ preceded by short vowel bearing a svaritA is
not subject to nasal elongation as in the RV/AV/kANva-SYV tradition.
However, there is such elongation under certain conditions.  
Rule 2: If a consonantal ‘n’ occurs as part of a consonant cluster with
two successive consonants (usually at n-s = n-th-s junctions) preceded
by a short vowel svarita then the ‘n’ is nasally elongated.  
udAharaNaM:  
The nasally elongated ‘n’ in bold and the svarita in red  
tasmi**n**th-suparNo (3rd trisuparNa mantra)  
tasmi**n**th-sahasrashAkhe |(in TU 1.9)
