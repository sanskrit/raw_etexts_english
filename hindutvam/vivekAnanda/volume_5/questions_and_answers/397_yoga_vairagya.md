## V

YOGA, VAIRAGYA, TAPASYA, LOVE

*Q*. — Does Yoga serve to keep the body in its full health and vitality?

*A*. — It does. It staves off disease. As objectification of one's own
body is difficult, it is very effective in regard to others. Fruit and
milk are the best food for Yogis.

*Q*. — Is the attainment of bliss synchronous with that of Vairagya?

*A*. — The first step in Vairagya is very painful. When perfected, it
yields supreme bliss.

*Q*. — What is Tapasyâ?

*A*. — Tapasya is threefold — of the body, of speech and of mind. The
first is service of others; the second truthfulness; and third, control
and concentration.

*Q*. — Why do we not see that the same consciousness pervades the ant as
well as the perfected sage?

*A*. — Realising the unity of this manifestation is a question of time
only.

*Q*. — Is preaching possible without gaining perfection?

*A*. — No. May the Lord grant that all the Sannyasin disciples of my
Master and of myself be perfected, so that they may be fit for
missionary work!

*Q*. — Is the divine majesty expressed in the Universal Form of Shri
Krishna in the Gita superior to the expression of love unattended with
other attributes, embodied in the form of Shri Krishna, for instance, in
His relation with the Gopis?

*A*. — The feeling of love, unattended with the idea of divinity, in
respect to the person loved, is assuredly inferior to the expression of
divine majesty. If it were not so, all lovers of the flesh would have
obtained freedom.
