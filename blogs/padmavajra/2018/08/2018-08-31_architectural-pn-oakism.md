Is an example of what I am talking about. Just because the shapes are
similar,it does not imply an actual continuity. Actual old Bengal
temples pre-Islam were mostly of the ‘deul’ types,and the sort of
architecture that would go into the making of a Buddhist vihāra. Example
are linked below

This style however did not entirely die out,as seen in the case of the
Begunia type of temples.

The typical Bengal terracotta styles(At-chala,etc) have their basic
unit/model as a small rural/village hut with a thatched roof,and the
similarities with the ancient inscription should be seen as a case of
convergence at best,rather than continuity,since they were built after
the Islamic iconoclastic frenzy destroyed every other standing temple in
Bengal/architecturally reused them for mosques,and show evidence of loss
of old techniques(the designs of the murtis originating from Bengal in
the medieval period itself should be evidence for this) used in Pala and
Sena times.
