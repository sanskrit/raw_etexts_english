## LII

*2nd May, 1900*.

DEAR AUNT ROXY, (Mrs. Blodgett of Los Angeles),

Your very, very kind letter came. I am down again with nerves and fever,
after six months of hard work. However, I found out that my kidneys and
heart are as good as ever. I am going to take a few days' rest in the
country and then start for Chicago.

  
I have just written to Mrs. Milward Adams and also have given an
introduction to my daughter, Miss Noble, to go and call upon Mrs. Adams
and give her all information she wants about the work.

 

Well, dear good mother, may all blessings attend you and peace. I just
want a bit of peace badly — pray for me. With love to Kate, 

Ever your son,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Love to Miss Spencer — the Basaquisitz(?), Mrs. S\_\_, and the other
friends.

A heap of loving pats on the head to Tricks.

V.
