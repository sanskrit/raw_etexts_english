were young then. Drinking from the well-springs of testosterone we had a
geometrical journey in the mental landscape. We stumbled upon the
Cartesian equation of the pedal curve of the ellipse with respect to its
center (do not remember it of hand). It brought us much luck. We then
toiled on in quest of the perimeter of the ellipse and got a glimpse of
the elliptic integral. On the way we stumbled on the Weierstrass
elliptic function and its fascinating double periodicity in both the
real and the imaginary plane, while the trigonometric functions are
mono-periodic only in the real plane.

But what really fascinated us was our rediscovery of the family of
curves termed the superellipses (we did not learn until much latter that
they were called Lame’s curves; Lame of Lame’s theorem fame of which we
had unpleasant memories). These are defined in cartesian space by the
equation:  
\[abs(x/a)\]^n+\[abs(y/b)\]^n=1 ; n\>0  
n=0 yields a cross; n=1 yields a rhombus; n=2 an ellipse/circle; n=4 &
a=b yields a squircle or hypercircle; n=3/2 yields a rhombic
hypoellipse; n-\>infinity is a square/rectangle.  
They can be parametrically described as:  
x(t) = 3\*sgn(cos(t))\*(abs(cos(t)))\*\*(2/n)  
y(t) = 3\*sgn(sin(t))\*(abs(sin(t)))\*\*(2/n)

This form can be used to plot them easily.

There is something aesthetically fascinating about these curves that we
decided to plot them again. A striking aspect we noticed was that they
describe all commonly used closed curves with n ranging from 0 to a
large number.
