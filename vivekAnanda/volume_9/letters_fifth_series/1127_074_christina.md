## LXXIV

*To Sister Christine*

228 W. 39TH STREET  
\[NEW YORK\]

*Dec. 10, 1895*

DEAR CHRISTINA,

Perhaps by this time you have received my first letter. I received yours
just now.

I had a splendid success in England and have left a *nucleus* there to
work till my arrival next summer. You will be astonished to learn that
some of my strongest friends are big "guns" of the Church of England.

This Christmas I am going away a week, from 24th Decem., to the country
with Mr. and Mrs. Leggett — after that I resume my work. In the
meanwhile the classes have begun.

I have written to you my intention of taking a quick turn through
Detroit and Chicago in the meanwhile and \[then\] return back.

Give Mrs. Phelps my love and kindly arrange the classes \[in Detroit\]
with her. The best thing is to arrange for a public lecture where I give
out my general plan of work. The Unitarian church is available; and if
the lecture is free, there will be a big crowd. The collection most
possibly will cover the expenses. Then out of this we will get the
materials of a big class and then hurry them through, leaving Mrs.
Phelps and you and Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\] to work on with them.

This plan is entirely feasible and if Mrs. Phelps and Mrs. Bagley desire
it, they can work it out very quickly.

Ever yours with love and blessings,

VIVEKANANDA
