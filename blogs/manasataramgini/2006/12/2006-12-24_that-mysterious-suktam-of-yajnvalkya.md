One of the most towering of the colossi of arcane Hindu thought is
yA\~jnavalkya, the great adhvaryu, who demolished all other brAhmaNa-s
who stood on his path. After he defeats his rivals in the famous
brahmodaya contest, which has become the basis of much of medieval and
modern Indian religious thought, he recited a very mysterious sUktaM.
When its accents are reconstructed the recitation as per the kANva
school of the shukla yajurvedins appears as below.
