title = "MJ from the past"

+++
shachIva and amAtya met old and witch-like MJ. MJ was a great adversary
of ours, but respected our battle skills greatly. She remembered how we
destroyed the stuff she hurled at us, despite certain nighmarish weapons
in her possession that shook us. MJ now heard of our situation and
suddenly reacted very unusually by deciding to work on our side. She
deployed the vaiShNava weapons. However, the kR^ityA was not countered
by that and brushing it aside charged on. We temporarily neutralized the
kR^ityA’s effects due to indra’s aid. Now we shall wait and see what
happens next.
