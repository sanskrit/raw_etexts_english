title = "AV vikR^iti pATha"

+++
With the upAkarma and veda-vrata having gone by last full-moon we took
the opportunity to illustrate the vikR^iti pATha-s of the AV-shaunaka.
The vikR^iti pATHa-s of the AV are largely extinct. But the AV-shaunaka
reciters do preserve portions of the different kANDa-s in vikR^iti
pATHa. Some recordings made by a Maharashtrian AV paNDita Ratate are
available. But the jaTApATha, which as far as I know, is practiced only
for kaNDa 17 is largely unknown among most chanters. These mantra-s are
used in the atharvanic rite to indrAviShNU in autumn for the offering of
the sweet cake known as Aditya-maNDaka. My AchArya knew several
vikR^iti-s of different parts of the AV entirely mentally. I wrote down
his svara-s in part that I learned. He pointed out that while the
brahmANDa purANa gives vyADI as the authority of the jaTApATha, the AV
vikR^iti recitation follows the rules of an authority called hayagrIva.
These rules come into play in the jaTA only, because the rest is
specified by the prAtishAkya grantha-s like the chaturAdhyAyika. The
rules concern those sequences known as vyutkrama-s where the order is
reversed. Hence they are not a part of ArsSha language and are called
anArSha for which the grammar needs to be reworked. The rule of
hayagrIva is thus given:  
abhikrame kramashAstraM pradhAnaM syAd vyutkrame vyAkaraNaM pradhAnaM
|  
uktaH krame vyutkramaNe visheShaH svarAH prakara dvitiye.apyaabhinna
||  
There must have been a text of hayagrIva, but we have no evidence if it
survived in entirety. In the cd of the above verse we see the term
“uktaH krame vyutkrame visheShaH” meaning that the difference between
krama vyutkrama has been stated indicating that this text earlier
discussed the definitions of krama vyutkrama in a jaTA sequence.

The learned shrI PR, the knower of RV vikR^iti-s, stated to me that they
too follow the rules of hayagrIva.
