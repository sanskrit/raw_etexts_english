title = "The professor’s war"

+++
It was the end of his work week. Vidrum came to the office of Vrishchika
of long tresses; she had just started her lab at the medical school.
Vrishchika put on her gloves and handed Vidrum a box: “Here is the kit
with the vials of recombinant hypocretin-1 that my technician purified
from the human hypothalamic fusion cell culture I had developed. Use it
on your patient as nasal spray using the buffer which is also inside.
You can get the instructions from my internal website for which I have
already issued you a password. If you might have any issues about
preparing the spray let me me know make sure to get it into the cold
storage ASAP.”  
Vidrum: “Thank you very much. I will ready it for him during the next
appointment but I am just curious have you tried it out on yourself?”  
Vrishchika smiled knowingly and said: “I had made these clones even when
we were in med-school and all I’ll say is I was certainly less depressed
than most female colleagues during the internship. By the way if you
need hypocretin receptor inhibitors I have made a bunch with my sister
Varoli, which are specific to either receptor or both.”  
Vidrum smiled back and said: “I get it. I’ll certainly obtain the vidyā
of the inhibitors from you whenever you have the time. Anyhow you have
good evening – I guess you are going to be busy working.”

Vrishchika: “Actually, I am leaving right now. Not everything is ready
in my lab here so I will be doing some things this evening in my
husband’s lab.”  
Vidrum: “I can drop you at the main campus if you don’t mind.”  
Vrishchika: “Thank you for offering a ride but I fear Meghana hates me
as much as she hates Lootika and my presence is likely spark unnecessary
tension.”  
Vidrum: “Of course I realize that and would not have even asked you if I
were picking her up too. But I must tell you that something strange
happened. Meghana has mysteriously gone totally out of contact for the
past month. Her phone number does not work and she has even vacated her
apartment.”  
Vrishchika: “That is odd indeed. But does no one else in your circle
have any information?”  
Vidrum: “Frankly, this is embarrassing to tell anyone else. It has left
me in a bit of a daze and you are the first person I am telling this.
Let me put the kit into storage. We will meet in about 15 minutes at the
parking lot and I’ll drop you off at your husband’s department.”  
Vrishchika: “But I don’t know if your vehicle can fit my bike.”  
Vidrum: “Sure it can. Let’s meet in 15 minutes”

As they were driving to the main campus Vrishchika said to Vidrum: “I
know you may not want to talk anymore about this but do you think
Meghana might have contracted marūnmāda?”  
Vidrum: “That’s a very strange question. Why?”  
Vrishchika: “Just asking.”  
Vidrum: “I know you’re never the person to just ask something – is it
because of the hate for Meghana that your sister has passed on to you or
something less frivolous.”  
Vrishchika: “Vidrum, as you have seen over all these years we have tried
our best not let the issues with Meghana come in the way of our
interactions with you. So why would I say something like this just to
hurt you. I don’t have a good recollection of all my seniors from school
and their life stories but you should check to see if a girl from your
school class was in yesterday’s news. May be it will give you some clue
regarding this mystery that has hit you.”  
Vidrum: “What a strange thing to say. Could you tell me more.”  
Vrishchika: “As I said I really don’t know too much and am unsure if I
recognize my seniors after all these years. Moreover, I don’t want to
wade into your personal matters and into things I poorly understand. But
I do recommend you scan the news when you get a chance to confirm or
dispel what I said. I must say, I didn’t register details of the news
item I am thinking about to be more precise in my inference – just a bit
of deduction that could be all wrong.”  
Vrishchika then went quiet.

Vidrum realized that it might not be something she was very keen to say
more about and broke the silence by asking her: “So are you all doing
some fun things this weekend?”  
Vrishchika: “Fun or not fun is all relative. I am in the midst of a
battle now – an investigation closely contested with a competitor.
Hence, I will be busy at work over the weekend.”  
Vidrum: “For once I don’t envy you guys.”  
Vrishchika: “It is all relative Vidrum. Everyone has their own worries.
”  
Vidrum: “Hope Indrasena is well? Say hi to him.”  
Vrishchika: “He is good, but as luck would have it he and Somakhya are
in the midst of a battle of their own with their bhrātṛvya-s. You know
being in science needs you to be something of a warrior. What are you
doing this weekend?”  
Vidrum: “Good luck to you scorpion-girl – sting well. I am having lunch
with Sharvamanyu and Abhirosha tomorrow and then we are going
rock-climbing with friends. Were you all not so busy you all could have
joined us.”

By then they had reached the school of life sciences and Vidrum dropped
off Vrishchika. Vrishchika bade him good bye and taking her bike
scampered off: “Thanks a lot Vidrum, good night, do check the news and
be careful with everything.”

Vidrum was puzzled by Vrishchika’s remarks and back home he started
checking the news. Before anything notable caught his eye he was
distracted by the interview of a famous cricketer. Just then he realized
that it was getting late for his exercise session and he dropped the
news to get his body worked. After dinner his sleep deficit and
exhaustion caught up with him and he was soon fast asleep.

◊◊◊◊◊

The next morning Vidrum woke up and used some of the hypocretin-1 he had
aliquoted on himself. After a while he felt he was feeling really good
and alert like he had never felt in sometime. He remarked to himself:
“That hypocretin-1 sure works.”

Sharvamanyu had already reached the restaurant and was waiting for
Vidrum sipping his glass of water. Seeing Vidrum nowhere in sight he
started reading the news on his tablet. He was jolted out of it when
Vidrum seated himself at the table: “Hey, sorry I had to attend to an
emergency with one of my patients.”  
Sharvamanyu: “No problem. Even Abhirosha said she would be late as she
had to do something at work.”  
Vidrum: “But you seemed to be quite lost in what you are reading –
something interesting?”  
Sharvamanyu: “Tucked away from all the usual news on the T20s and other
masālā is this strange bit of news: ‘Tamanna Sharif vanishes from
custody.’ ”  
Vidrum: “What? You mean the girl who was in our class by that name?”  
Sharvamanyu: “I believe it is actually the very same woman. She seems to
be keeping with her distinguished family as a good marūnmattā.”  
Vidrum: “Come on, why do you say so; not all Moslems are terrorists.
Meghana had even brought her to our house with her husband Abu Hilal.
They seemed like really nice, cultured people with a taste for fine
poetry and a passion for justice in society.”  
Sharvamanyu: “Well, nice and cultured means nothing to me. I have
personally seen her people doing all things marūnmatta-s do.”  
Vidrum: “What happened?”  
Sharvamanyu: “Well you may remember the arson at Dakṣiṇaśālā which
happened when we were young.”  
Vidrum: “Yes, I do recall that. I thought it was the radical Moslems
from the Mohammadwadi dargah. What does it have to do with Tamanna?”  
Sharvamanyu: “Let me refresh you. I was returning that day from the
Sanskrit language class since I could not attend the morning batch with
you that day. Just then I got the news from my darker friends, whom you
guys don’t know, that the marūnmatta-s had set fire to many shops in at
the Dakṣiṇaśālā and where pelting stones at all those who were trying to
get out of the inferno. I made it to the parking lot where I had parked
my bike and was joined by my two friends who were also well-armed. Just
then Saif ad-din Sharif with four other dāḍīvāle arrived at the parking
lot with knives, petrol bombs and fire brands to set fire to the
vehicles. We were just three and they five but we walloped the hell out
of them and could have easily sent them to naraka that day but stopped
with handing them over to the māmū-s to take care of the rest.”  
Vidrum: “Wow, you can be violent. But they fully deserved it. But I
still don’t get what all this has to do with Tamanna ?”

Sharvamanyu: “The article says she had been arrested a couple of days
back at Mumbai while she was on route to London to talk at a human
rights meeting. The Intelligence Bureau had good evidence that she was
involved in espionage and might have been in the process of transmitting
critical information to an agent in Laṇḍapura. Hence, they nabbed her.
She had been placed in custody for interrogation. Her employers from an
NGO which is funded by the Guillaume Glympton Human Rights Fund are said
to have sent a top lawyer to represent her. But the news today is that
she has mysteriously escaped from custody. The IB agents suspect Tamanna
Sharif some how got off when her lawyer visited her and has flown off to
Laṇḍapura using the passport of another woman who worked with the GG
foundation. Saif ad-din Sharif the mastermind of that arson was none
other than her brother. ”  
Vidrum’s face turned pale in a visibly quivering voice he asked:
“Sharva, really?”  
Sharvamanyu sensed the sudden change in Vidrum’s face and voice: “Why,
any problem?”  
Vidrum: “I have something really bad to tell you.”  
Vidrum then conveyed to Sharvamanyu the strange situation regarding
Meghana  
Sharvamanyu: “What\! that is disturbing indeed\! Did Meghana not have
something to do with the GG foundation?”  
Vidrum: “Well that’s why I find this all disturbing. She was indeed a
legal assistant for the said foundation. Though I had no clue what the
foundation exactly did. But I must further tell you that Vrishchika made
some strange statements to me yesterday. I simply did not understand
them then but from what I hear now she seemed to be linking Meghana’s
disappearance with that of Ms. Sharif.  
Sharvamanyu: “Vrishchika as ever is a sharp kid. From all we know of
this case she seems to have made a potentially right connection.
Intriguing indeed\!”  
Saying so Sharvamanyu too went quiet even as he tried to wrap his mind
around all that was known. Vidrum simply stared at emptily at the menu
card even as he turned all the worst-case scenarios in his head.

Just then Sharvamanyu’s fiancee Abhirosha glided in and having hugged
him sat beside him.  
Sharvamanyu: “Got some work done sweetie?”  
Abhirosha: “Yes had a fairly productive morning. But everything OK with
you’ll? You seem to have rather this rather perplexed look?”  
Sharvamanyu: “Nothing; we were just puzzled over this news item
regarding an old classmate being up to some bad mischief.” Saying so he
passed Abhirosha his tablet.  
Upon glancing through it Abhirosha remarked: “Ah, our daṇḍika-s seem
pretty inept to let her go\!”  
Just then she realized that Vidrum had hardly registered her arrival and
noticing the look on his face asked: “Everything OK Vidrum?”  
Vidrum: “Not really. But Sharva can fill you in later. Let us get moving
with lunch. I would just have something light my appetite seems to have
gone.”  
Abhirosha looked at both of them and sensing the tension in Vidrum
asked: “Why, what’s wrong. Is there something we can help with?”  
Vidrum however insisted they get moving with the starters and as they
started savoring them he gradually reiterated everything, partly
speaking out aloud, and partly to fill in Abhirosha about all that had
happened.  
Abhirosha: “What you say about Meghana is really sad. But I must tell
you this woman Ms Sharif may not be as innocent as she seems.”  
Sharvamanyu: “Did you know her?”  
Abhirosha: “Not really but one incident comes to mind which I have told
you before – the past life of Abu Hilal – all keeping with what we know
of the Sharif clan.”  
Sharvamanyu: “Yes.”  
Vidrum: “What’s that?”  
Sharvamanyu: “Vidrum, don’t worry and eat well. We have good day’s worth
of climbing ahead of us.”  
Vidrum: “But I hope you realize this hits much closer to home for me.”  
Sharvamanyu: “I do realize it. But it is water under the bridge now.
Meghana has disappeared without telling you – that tells you she is not
someone to spend your life with. Moreover, it is best you dissociate
yourself from her. If you were in the big police state of the mlecchas
you would have been by now subject to some Bhāgurāyaṇa treatment by
their over-armed māmū-s. You have done well in training yourself as a
physician and have bright career ahead of you. So with help from your
friends you can certainly move on in life and fulfill the incomplete
matters sooner or later. The gods never give all goods things to one
person.”

Abhirosha and Sharvamanyu tried to change the topic repeatedly but they
found Vidrum to be quite affected by the events. After lunch they took
the train to go the station where Gardabh and Mahish and two others were
going to meet them for their climb. While on the train Vidrum again
asked them about the incident Abhirosha had alluded to. Seeing his
anxiety she decided to tell him the story:  
“It was the year I was to appear for the college entrance exam. You all
being one class senior to me would have been in your first year of
pre-university college. Most of my classmates were going to various
coaching classes but I was careless about it and did not enroll myself
soon enough. Seeing my classmates talk about all they had learned in
their classes even as the vacations were underway I panicked. It was
then that my junior Vrishchika told me that her sister Lootika could
give such classes for both science and mathematics by herself and would
not even charge a hefty fee. All we had to do was to pay her in kind in
the form of renewable hardware for her home-lab. Many of us in the
school were aware of the academic exploits of Lootika and her sisters,
so I thought who could be a better teacher than her, and enrolled for
her coaching along with three other girls. We would take the bus to go
her house. Beyond the curricular education I must say she filled me in
with things that were to be important in life – while history was not
part of the curriculum she educated me for the first time about our
history and the importance of being aware and involved in the war
against the ūnmāda-s. At the bus-stop near her home, we used to often
run into another fellow who was from some other school who claimed to
also be attending some class. His name was Amitabh. He was a slick guy
who would constantly be trying to seduce the girls in our group, often
spouting Urdu couplets, movie dialogs, and waxing about this marūnmatta
poet or that. Two of my companions were actually rather taken in by him
but due to Lootika’s stern admonition – and you know how brusque she can
be – they backed off. But Amitabh soon found another girl from our
school at the bus stop who would often come to see Meghana who lived
near by then. She was none other than this Ms. Sharif who is in the news
today. Eventually, he married her and converted to marūnmāda as Abu
Hilal.”

Hearing the story Vidrum felt a bit relieved that it had not direct
impact on the situation at hand on the other hand it only reinforced his
concerns about Meghana’s entanglement with them. He nervously remarked:
“I don’t know why he had to convert to marry her.”  
Abhirosha: “Well a marūnmatta might use anything in jihad be it a solid
object like a stone or a mere abstraction like romance.”  
Vidrum: “I wonder what Abu Hilal might be up to in all this.”  
Sharvamanyu: “I was wondering about that too. But not something we can
do much about. He is probably enjoying himself at Oxford debating about
Islam versus Islamism with the famous atheist professor Dave
Cockburn.”  
Just then the train was pulling into to station they were headed for.
Abhirosha again remarked: “Now let’s drop all of this and get going with
our climbing. After all what can inconsequential little people like us
do about this complicated geopolitics. As part of my job I so often send
notices to the Finance Department of our state about all kinds of
accounting chicanery of these mleccha NGOs. They just don’t seem to be
bothered.”

◊◊◊◊◊

For Yang He the escape of Tamanna Sharif mattered much more than it did
to Vidrum. He was known as the Chinese physician and public health
expert who was helping the terrorist state with with a health survey for
a prevention program at Gwadar. He was buzzed in early in the morning in
his sleep by an emergency message, which upon decrypting read:  
“Both the ISI and the MI6 are likely to be upon you if they have already
not already crossed your path. You need to abort and get out ASAP to
save all other assets.” He quickly took his key data and scampered to
access his secret boat that he had kept ready for this escape.

It mattered nearly as much to the engineer Sven Focke who had come from
Norway to help the Pakistanis with some high tech installations at
Gwadar. Focke had just received an encrypted message from England which
read:  
“Yang He is the man. He is said to have stuff which the Research
Department says would be of great interest to you. It might be in a
well-protected safe, which he probably will take with him in case the
Hindoo bastards manage to tip him off. They are surprised these Hindoo
crooks have managed to pull off something like this. There must be some
mastermind in their midst and we need to get to the bottom this. By the
way Abu Hilal expects us to do him a good turn by snuffing out He once
you get what we need.”

Focke remarked to himself: “These Hindoos seem to have gotten rather
smart but I was quite on the right scent it seems. I must strike the
blow for against the the deceit of the wily Brahmin and the Baniyan.”
Thinking so he loaded his weapons, suitably concealed them, and looked
at his device for the position of all the foreign and ISI agents he had
bugged using the remarkable technology they had developed at the
Research Department of the MI6. Yang He was not locatable any more. Sven
Focke now swung into action. He messaged his “mother ship” of the coast
of Oman to deploy a couple of drones to sweep the route that he inferred
Yang He might be taking to reach the Indian coast. He himself boarded
his boat and set off to position himself suitably to perform an
interception.

Now in high seas Yang He felt he would after all make it to the soil of
his country. For the first time in a while he felt the immediate danger
was behind him. Sailing through a completely empty patch of the western
sea he checked his coordinates to make sure he was headed the right way
to make contact with the MARCOS vessel. In that temporary moment of calm
for the first time he got a chance to review all that had happened under
the daze of the adrenalin-triggered response the message at Gwadar had
set rolling. On one hand he was disappointed that this near fool-proof
intelligence operation with such long term promise had been so
unexpectedly burnt. He kept wondering: “How on earth did someone leak
our position.” On the other hand he was somewhat happy to have made it
alive with his secrets. As he turned these over in his head he found his
receiver flashing. He tuned into the message – the MARCOS had sent him a
course correction for the impending rendezvous. He accordingly checked
his fuel level and changed course. In a short while, to his surprise, he
saw a boat at the distance. As he tried to get a better view of it with
his binoculars, he suddenly sensed something entering the clear blue
canopy over the foams of western sea. Realizing to his horror that he
was being tailed by a UAV, he got ready to message the MARCOS vessel.
Before he could get his message to them, the UAV fired a rocket. He was
distracted by the flash and shortly thereafter felt a pain in his upper
arm. He saw that he had been struck by a dart and was starting feeling
woozy. On the other side he saw the boat nearing him. It dawned on him
that a capture operation was underway and tried to scuttle his secret
data. Before Yang He could do so he was struck by another dart that
seemed to immobilize his arms. Knowing that he could not be taken alive,
he barely managed to send the MARCOS a distress signal, scuttled his
boat, and swallowed the fatal toxin capsule he had with him. The MARCOS
men began a dash to his position when to their horror they were attacked
by another UAV. While they brought it down the delay was sufficient for
Sven Focke to get Yang He’s boat and take his data and make off.

Unsurprisingly, beyond a handful of people this death and drama on the
high seas remained unknown to the rest of humanity.

◊◊◊◊◊

It was a somber winter afternoon when Vrishchika heard a knock on her
office door and saw her senior colleague Prof. Jay Budhoo enter. She
ushered him to a chair in front of her desk.  
JB: “Is this time alright for a brief chat?”  
Vrishchika: “Sure, Dr. Budhoo”  
JB: “You would certainly know Prof. Steven Harrison from Ukṣatīrtha the
noted neurologist, who I am extremely delighted to say is doing a
sabbatical with me. He is working on improving cognition in the elderly
and has been doing some remarkable basic research on the same and more
generally on longevity. He would like to meet you one of these days for
he wants to discuss something that he believes would be of great mutual
interest.”  
Vrishchika: “Sure, I would be glad to meet him any day this week in the
afternoon. He can drop me a mail before stopping by just to make sure I
am not in the middle of an experiment.”  
JB: “Thank you.”  
Vrishchika: “If you don’t mind Dr. Budhoo, just out of curiosity, how do
you happen to know Harrison?”  
JB: “Steve is a great indophile and has always been interested in
progress of the Indian peoples and diaspora. He used to be on the Oxford
Thought Leadership Program and had selected me to do my medical research
as a graduate student funded by that scheme. He has always kept in good
touch with the labs of his students and the work they have been doing
for literally saving the world.”  
Vrishchika: “That’s great. Thank you.”  
JB: “Vrishchika, you must try to impress him. If Steve is happy with you
he could even recommend you for funding from the Guillaume Glympton
Foundation, which has just announced that they would be funding
interesting medical research.”

Duly Harrison and Vrishchika had set up an appointment for the meeting.
On the said day Vrishchika was in her office checking the time wondering
why Harrison had not yet showed up. As she did so she thought to
herself: “These mleccha-s\! I am pretty sure it was the same Harrison
who tried to hold up our paper for nearly an year to try to reproduce
our work and pass it off as his. I wonder what he wants from me. I am
sure this urge to meet me cannot be innocent. Moreover, it is really
strange that he is doing a sabbatical with Budhoo, who has hardly
anything to offer him…” More than half an hour had passed since the
appointed time and he had not yet shown up. Vrishchika called up Jay
Budhoo to check what was going on. He spoke to his students and said
that they had not seen Harrison the entire day. By that night Budhoo was
already contacting the police over the case of the missing Prof.
Harrison. The police knowingly told him that they were on the case and
he should quietly wait.

A few days later officials from the Intelligence Bureau were at
Vrishchika’s office asking her about Harrison. She told them all that
had happened. Then they specifically asked her if he had tried to obtain
information from her about the stuff she had trained the Research and
Analysis agent Dev Buragohain in. She again clarified to them that
beyond the e-mail which they had exchanged there was no further
communication between them and that he had mysteriously not turned up
for the meeting they were to have.

That evening as Vrishchika was riding home she was telling Indrasena
about her questioning by the IB officials and wondered aloud what it
might have to do with the agent with whom they had interacted, Dev
Buragohain, who was trained as a physician. Indrasena: “That interesting
dear. I just saw a news today that the IB has arrested a guy called Capt
Virendra Chauhan from the Military Medical College in connection to
leaking secrets that compromised some of the most important intelligence
operations.”  
Vrishchika: “We never heard anything ever again from Buragohain. Wonder
if they every deployed our stuff?”  
Indrasena: “Indeed, your trials were very promising”  
Vrishchika: “They were. That’s why I recommended them to deploy it and
trained Buragohain. Wonder if he was compromised in any way.”

It was an evening of the navarātrī festival. The caturbhaginī, their
consorts, and children had gathered at Sharvamanyu and Abhirosha’s house
for a feast.  
Abhirosha: “Lootaa, this book, a memoir of a retired English scientist
and agent is rather interesting. He was a biomedical researcher – I
believe you would find it interesting in more than one way.”  
Lootika: “As you have known well – I seldom read such literature. But
how come you got interested in it?”  
Sharvamanyu: “I brought it to her attention: as you know I keep an eye
on this intelligence stuff.”  
Abhirosha: “Lootaa, this actually might be of considerable interest in
clearing many things.”  
Lootika: “Why? What’s his name?”  
Abhirosha: “Douglas Fieldman”.  
Vrishchika: “Ah\! He was a close collaborator with Steven Harrison on
studies to reverse aging. I believe he had undue ‘interest’ in the work
we had done with Somakhya and Lootika on the nucleotides in ADP-ribose
system.”  
Varoli: “Had run into Fieldman at a conference – he apparently started
off as an engineer. Mentioned a nasty bit of his autobiography. He had
apparently worked with Maoist terrorists in Chattisgad.”  
Abhirosha: “Exactly, that is true. He mentions it in his memoir. That’s
why I said it is interesting.”  
Indrasena: “Sharva and Abhi could you tell us more. I am just beginning
to wonder if it might have something to do with mysterious incidents
around Harrison’s unexpected return to England and Chauhan’s arrest.”  
Sharvamanyu and Abhirosha: “We believe reading his memoirs we have
uncovered a tangled skein the runs through so many things that has
puzzled over the years.”  
Mitrayu: “Why ‘am I not surprised. I guess at its heart lies the
mleccha-marūnmattābaddham that the discerning have the eyes to see.
Whatever the case, you seem to have hit a gold mine; we would indeed
like to hear the details.”  
Jhilleeka: “Perhaps it also ties together the mysterious computer
incidents. Remember those Prachetas?”  
Abhirosha: “Jhilli, that’s why we wanted to wait till we had all of you
all with us to talk about this.”  
Sharvamanyu: “Vipra-s and vipra-patnī-s why don’t you all seat
yourselves comfortably. We will lay out everything to you all in order.
But there are some holes that we believe you all can best fill in for
us. Abhi, could you start by reading out that interesting opening
paragraph from Fieldman’s account of his passage to India?”

Abhirosha read the account of Fieldman: “*Many around me would have said
I was at the peak of my career. I had just won a big grant for research
on Sirtuin inhibitors and the best students and post-docs from around
the world ardently vying for a place in my lab. But I felt restless. I
raged at injustice and inequality taking place all over he world. I
wanted to be in the fight against it. Engels had said: ‘Just as Darwin
discovered the law of development of organic nature, so Marx discovered
the law of development of human history’. I was putting Darwin practice
in my life but felt an equal pull to put into practice the discoveries
of Marx ‘to contribute to the liberation of the modern proletariat’. It
was then that I was being conferred an award for my researches by his
Highness Sultan Abdur Rahman as-Sullami that great man among the Arabs.
During the ceremony I was introduced the young naturalist Abu Hilal and
his charming wife Tamanna Sharif from India. They shared my passion for
social justice in addition to a love for wildlife and we spent a while
in pleasant discussion. They brought me up to speed with the great
injustice that was being perpetrated in India – on the tribals, the
untouchables and the Moslems. It was then that it struck me that in the
third world more than anywhere else the concept of a country was
absolutely meaningless. The way ahead was to do away with national
boundaries and the oppressive surge of capitalism. Accordingly, I left
my lab in the care of my dear mate and collaborator Steven Harrison to
join Abu Hilal in the forests of India. We had made much progress in a
short while but were betrayed by wiles of the Brahmin and the Baniyan,
who Abu informs me to be most guileful of the Indian castes. It is not a
surprise that they have held the downtrodden of India in their thrall
either through superstition or monetary inequity for more than two
thousand years. Sadly, I had to leave the project in Chattisgad
incomplete and return to Oxford because I knew I would be more useful
for the cause if I survived to fight again.*”

Vrishchika: “That plainly makes an intersection with our sphere. Do you
recall this Hilal and Sharif made a dramatic escape to Laṇḍapura years
ago.”  
Sharvamanyu: “How could we forget it? It also marked the disappearance
of Vidrum’s girl Meghana, whose fate also becomes clear in the memoir.
Abhi could you read that part?”  
Abhirosha read on: “*The major operation could have all come to naught
if the young lady Meghana, who was so strongly committed to the cause of
social justice in India had not extricated Tamanna at great personal
risk… In the subsequent years Meghana worked closely with the GG
foundation and my trust on several human rights cases in the Middle
East. Most unfortunately, this bright star in the fight for social
justice was snuffed out young when she was shot by an Israeli agent
while working on the legal defense of the Palestinian activist Mohammad
Sumbel.*”

Vrishchika: “Did you tell Vidrum about that?”  
Sharvamanyu: “Why rake up old wounds. I believe he has moved on…”

Prachetas: “But you seem to have skipped something what was the major
operation in which he is talking about?”  
Abhirosha: “He does not provide the details but says that at one point
he was called upon by the British Army chief to ‘use his assets to bring
to a conclusion a key operation in Pakistan’. It was of such critical
importance because had he not pulled it off all English assets in
Pakistan might have been ruined once and for all and the very existence
of this important client state in the subcontinent jeopardized\! He goes
on to add that he carried out the operation with the highest level of
cooperation from Tamanna and Abu who created a mole in the Indian
intelligence head quarters. This allowed him to discover and neutralize
the sophisticated Indian agent who had been operating as the Chinese
physician Yang He at Gwadar\!”

Indrasena: “Vrishchika, that explains what happened to Dev
Buragohain\!”  
Sharvamanyu: “That was indeed a gap which we never understood could you
please fill that in.”  
Vrishchika: “Since the idea began with Somakhya and then took shape in
Lootika’s hands I will let them tell the first part of the story. Please
fill everyone in on the mysterious Erk5 UMPylating enzyme.”

Somakhya: “Years ago during my study on the toxins involved
inter-organismal conflicts systems I discovered a novel family of
nucleotidyltransferases of the Polymerase Beta superfamily, one of which
was from an isolate of the bacterium *Burkholderia pyrrocinia*. I had
passed it on to Lootika to identify its substrates. She found that one
of its targets in humans was the MAP kinase ERK5 and showed it to be
UMPylated by the enzyme. Thereafter the story passes back to your hands
Vrishchika, so continue…”  
Vrishchika: “The inspiration for it was really tangential. I was at a
conference where I saw two researchers. One of Hindu origin and the
other a prathamonmatta. The two were well-matched in IQ and technical
skills, yet the latter was a winner while the former a loser. While
there are many factors that could collectively explain it, I wondered if
at least one of those might have a genetic basis. I found support for
such a genetic foundation in the polymorphisms of the oxytocin system. I
wanted to do some experiments in this regard when I got chatting about
it with my agrajā and Somakhya who mentioned I could fiddle with the
ERK5 signaling in neurons using their nucleotidyltransferase. It was
around that time Somakhya and Indrasena discovered another class of
toxins and found that it was delivered into eukaryotic cells using an
N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain. I engineered a protein with the
*Burkholderia* nucleotidyltransferase and a ubiquitin-like domain from
the toxin of a fungus *Mortierella* and was soon able to easily get it
inside neuronal cells. To cut a long story short I had a means of
playing with oxytocin signaling in human neurons and even figured out a
way to get it into live animals and manipulate their behavior,
especially trust behavior. This was what we eventually developed as a
potential mind-altering tool where the UMPylation of ERK5 in the neurons
could be used to manipulate the oxytocin system and make people
extremely trusting and thus reveal secrets. The military was
super-interested in this and we trained Dev Buragohain who had east
Asian ancestry to infiltrate the marūnmatta-s and deploy this agent. It
was seen to greatly aid in intelligence gathering but the project
mysteriously ended.

Somakhya: “By putting together what came out in the public of the
Virendra Chauhan case we can infer the following: Abu Hilal used Tamanna
Sharif to set up a honey-trap operation to lure Virendra Chauhan at the
Central Command Medical College who was liaising with Yang He, i.e., Dev
Buragohain. He spilled the beans to them and blew the cover of this
operation. They were to make their way to the mleccha island with their
intelligence – Hilal got through but our māmū-s captured Sharif. The
mleccha-s used Meghana to smuggle Sharif out using money and resources
of the famous NGO the GG foundation for which she worked. Fieldman was
the one who was in TSP and put an end to Buragohain. He came to know of
our whole oxytocin system and knew that only people who could be at the
center of this is our gang. So he sent his colleague Harrison to get us
and our secrets. Among other things Harrison was personally interested
in the nucleotide we had devised and synthesized which binds inactive
Nudix domains and to improve aspects of physiology while aging. But for
some reason that was abruptly aborted…”

Indrasena: “The reason it got aborted was he was going to pay agents to
attack our computers or us or our labs physically. The night before he
put that plan to action the government had suddenly demonetized the
large currency notes. He was now in trouble because all his notes were
useless. So he sent his agent to the bank to convert them to valid
denominations and send them over to Chauhan from whom he was to collect
it. This was when the IB caught scent of them. He escaped with help from
the English embassy, but Chauhan fell into the trap and has since then
probably been enjoying Bhāgurāyaṇopacāraḥ. We know this because a
retired general who joined Rajiv Jaisval Pratibhraṣṭācār party routinely
complains about the gross human rights violation arising from the
torture of army physician Chauhan.”

Prachetas: “It did not end with Harrison’s departure. There were many
sophisticated break ins into Somakhya and Vrishchika’s machines. Luckily
the inner core was not breached due to Jhilleeka’s devices. However,
many of the military machines were broken in. When she brought this to
my attention I counter-attacked and traced them to Laṇḍapura, while
shoring up our defenses.”

Sharvamanyu: “Nor has it ended. In fact we remain deeply infiltrated and
might see a grim clash in future where only one side would remain
standing. A section from the conclusion of Fieldman’s memoir sums it up.
Dear Abhi …”

Abhirosha read from Fieldman’s memoir: “*Earlier I delighted in the
spurts of adrenalin which came from fighting all over the world for
justice and equality through the smoking end of the barrel. The thrill
that high espionage gave me cannot be compared with anything else.
However, as we have learned from comrade Che Guevara’s life and from my
own experience ultimate success lies in a different kind of work. In my
youth I thought that the great British empire was a symbol of
oppression. But the more I thought about it, I learned that it was the
opposite. Real oppression is what you saw in the rule of the Nazis, or
the south American despots or the brahminical system of caste in India.
We in contrast were bringing the rule of law to replace tramplings by
elephants, the wonders of science to replace obscurantism, and above all
an egalitarian social message that every woman and man should have a
equal and fair share of the nation’s wealth. Indeed, this is appreciated
by those who have transcended the narrow and artificial straits of
nationalism. My friend, professor Saptagiri Raman from Oxford, said to
me that had it not been for Britain’s civilizing influence the Indians
would still be insisting that the sun goes round the earth. There might
have been some excesses that went with the age during the British rule,
but certainly the vast subcontinent of India could not have been
civilized without the values we brought to them.*

*Hence, I believe that it is these values which we need to spread even
more than ever before as the Hindu fascists threaten to consolidate
their rule over the subcontinent. Not surprisingly, they hate Islam
which can be seen as an earlier attempt to bring a rational discourse to
mankind along with the attendant concepts of egalitarianism. For these
reasons my colleague Harrison and I have developed and supported this
program where we have been creating the harbingers for tomorrow’s India.
Trained in liberal thought and charged with a zeal for bringing justice
to their people they would return to their country and transform it. In
this context I must acknowledge Justices Thapar and Karim formerly of
the Indian Supreme Court who had been so helpful to me as I was being
harassed by the rowdy elements passing off as police in India. They had
told me that they had a vision for India as a secular nation that has
shed its meaningless shibboleths and approached life and law in rational
way. They had an appreciation for my work with Dr. Assolkar in rooting
out irrationality and said that this India could only be born if we
could create thought-leaders who would spread among the masses ushering
an age of reason in the midst.*”
