+++


There must be indeed very few Sahskritists who have read the justly 
popular Nala-Damayanti episode of the Mahabharata and n<A felt disposed 
to echo the sentiments of A. W. V. Schlegel that the poem “ can hardly be 
surpassed in pathos and ethos, ini the enthralling force and tenderness of the 
sentiments.” * It is without doubt one of the most beautiful love stories of the 
world, striking on account of the simplicity of its style and the beauty of its 
imagery. Owing to its innate attractiveness and transparent lucidity, it has 
been the custom, since a long time, at almost all Western Universities, to 
begin the study of Sanskrit with the reading of this romantic little poem, for 
which purpose it is no doubt excellently suited. Its popularity may be judged 
from the fact that it has been translated not only into English. French and 
German, but also into Italian, Swedish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Greek and 
Hungarian amcMig the European languages.^ Every province of India can 
of course boast of its own version of this superb little epc^jee. 

Regarded as an integral part of the Mahabharata,^ the episode is a pal- 
pable “interpolation”, impending annoyingly the march of the epic story, 
and is forced upon the reader of the Epic in the most barefaced manner. 
During the exile of the Papdavas they receive a casual visit from a peripatetic 
sage called Bphadasva. Yudhisthira— as is usual with him — complains to 
him of the misfortune which has overtaken him and his family, and asks the 
sage whether there has ever been a more unfortunate king than himself. 
Thereupon Brhada^va forthwith relates the Nala story, in 27 adhySyas, com- 
prising something like l lOO stanzas or 2200 lines. There could be no clearer 
instance of deliberate interpolation, introduced with a coolness difficult to 
match. Yet we are really intensely grateful at heart in this case, as in the 
case of the Savitri ^isode, — ^the two immortal stories that are ktMWn and 
loved throughout the length and breadth of India— that s<Mne meddlesome 
interpolator had the courage to interrupt deliberately the smooth flow of the 
epic narrative with these beautiful digressions and thus saved them £295} 
from falling a prey to the ravages of Time. And so with a number of other

THE NALA EPISODE AND THE RAMAYAI^A 407 

interpolations in the Great Epic. Many of them richly deserved to be “ inter- 
polated ’ in this Golden Treasury of the Myths and Legends of India. 

Not only has the Nala-Damayandi poem what may be called a lively 
story-interest, but it is also clothed in a most attractive garb. The charm- 
ingly simple diction of this exquisite little poem is marked by a rigorous eco- 
nomy of words and “ ornaments ” ; the construction of the story is also on 
the whole remarkably faultless : qualities which have endeared it to con- 
noisseurs all the world over. The narrative, like a sylvan brook, runs its 
meandering course naturally and smoothly to its destined conclusion. And in 
spite of a few inevitable scenes of divine intervention and a little exaggeration 
necessary for artistic effect, we carry away the impression that the story rests 
on a foundation of fact, and we feel that it may all have happened, in those 
wonderful bygone times, exactly as it is narrated here. 

In the whole length of this carefully and artistically constructed poem 
there is just one passage which is apt slightly to perplex a careful reader. It 
is the soliloquy of the Brahman Sudeva in chapter 16 of the poem (B. 3. 
68. 8 ff.). On reading this passage a discerning reader would notice for one 
thing a sudden change to a rather florid style, marked by a plethora of epi- 
thets and a rich embroidery of similes. 

The situation is this. King Nala, having deserted Damayanti where 
she lay asleep, strode through the forest aimlessly until he met the snake- 
king Karkotaka, who, in return for a good turn done to him, transformed 
the handsome Nala into an ugly hunchback and advised him to go to Ayodhya 
and seek service as a charioteer with king Stuparipa. Nala does so and 
remains at the court of IJtupaiioa in the service of the king. His where- 
abouts and identity are not known tof any living soul besides himself : which 
is a very important point in the narrative. Damayanti, in the meanwhile, 
after a number of perilous adventures, reaches, by a fortunate coincidence, 
the palace of the queen of the Cedis, who is no other than Damayanti’s own 
aunt (as is revealed later), who takes compassion on her and gives her shelter. 
In course of time the evil tidings of the fateful game of dice and the subse- 
quent exile of Nala and Damayanti reached king BMma, I>amayantrs father. 
Thereupon he called to him some Brahmins and enjoined them, with pronuse 
of rich gifts, that they should search for Nala and Damayanti and bring them 
back to him. One of these Brahmins, the fortunate Sudeva, comes to the 
country of the Cedis and there, in the palace hall, he sees Damayanti and 
recognises her forthwith. On seeing the wan, unkempt and forlorn appearance 
of the beautiful princess of Vidarbha, he indulges in a soliloquy before 
addressing her directly. This passage, as already remarked, scenes marked 
out from the rest of the poem by attempts at higher flights of imagination, 
approadiing the requirements vof what is known as the Kavya style. Dama- 
yanti is here successively compared by Sudeva to i§if (or Lak?mi), to the full

moon, to Rati (Cupid's consort), to the splendour of the full moon, to a lotus 
stalk, to a full-moon night, to a river, to {[296} a lotus pool, again to a lotus 
stalk, and finally to the crescent of the moon (B. 3. 68. 10-17). That, how- 
ever, is a minor matter. 

The really perplexing part of the soliloquy is the way in which Sudeva 
refers to Nala in the following stanza (B. 3. 68. 20) : 

duskaram kurute 'tyartham Inno yad anayd Nalali | 
dhdray<^y dtmano deham na sokendvasidati || 

'‘Extremely difficult is the trial of Nala who, deprived of lier (scil. 
Damayanti), supports his body and does not pine away in sorrow ! ” 

This can be properly said by a person who knows that Nala is heroically 
bearing the cruel blow of fate which had temporarily separated him from his 
beloved, and above all that Nala is alive. But for all Sudeva knew, Nala 
might have been dead. Here is a slight incongruity to start with. It might 
be argued that as it was not definitely known that Nala was dead, Sudeva was 
to a certain extent justified in assuming that Nala was alive, and so this out- 
burst was after all not so very incongruous. But, even if he were alive, how 
was Sudeva to know whether Nala wanted to recover Damayanti ; in fact, to 
know at all what feelings Nala entertained then about Damayanti : they 
might conceivably have been even hostile, for all Sudeva could say. Such 
minute analysis of hidden motives and distant possibilities might, however, 
be regarded as captious criticism, when considering such an old-world love 
poem as this. 

The disturbing; thought however recurs when a few lines later we read 
(B. 3. 68. 23 ab) : 

asyd nunam pmarldbhm Nakadhah pntim esyati j 
“ Through her recovery Nala will become happy indeed ”, 

words which again definitely presuppose that Nala is alive and anxious to 
rediscover his lost Damayanti, neither of which facts could have been known 
to Sudeva, and whose assumption by him is quite gratuitous and most puzzling 
to the reader. Inappropriate to a certain extent are in the same context the 
adjectives aprameyasya and viryasattvo^vatatj. (stanza 25) applied to Nala. 
Was it not through Nala’s own insane infatuation for dice that Damayanti 
was reduced to this condition, and all that great disaster was brought upon 
the two families ? A discordant note is likewise struck by the words Nai^adhc 
Wh>ati Vaidaribhtm (stanza 24), which under these circumstances seem pecu- 
liarly inappropriate. One rather feels at this stage that poor Damayanti had 
definitely made the wrong choice at the svayamvara : she would have been 
much happier had she chosen, in preference to the profligate Nala, one of the 
four gods who were wooing her. 

Another very curious thing we notice about this passage is that while 
Sudeva waxes eloquent about Nala and his sufferings, he has no thought at 



tHE NALA EI^ISODg AND THfe rAMAYA^JA 409 

the moment for king Bhima, who is Sudeva’s patron and who has dispatched 
him on this errand. Sudeva has not a, word to say in this long soliloquy as 
to how glad the fond parents would be on seeing their beloved Damayanti 
and how happy Damayantf would be on being reunited to her kinsfolk. From 
£297} his present words we could never guess that he had been sent by king 
Bhima or that he had any connection with the House of Vidarbha. 

Our first thought is that the whole passage is one of those modem inter- 
polations which have unintentionally disfigured many a fine old poem. The 
manuscripts do not however countenance such an idea. The passage is docu- 
mented uniformly by all manuscripts alike. It is therefore not in any case 
a recent interpolation. Moreover the idea itself of the soliloquy is not by 
any n^eans inherently inappropriate ; only the precise wording and some of 
the sentiments expressed seem a little incongruous. 

We are therefore led to conclude that the poet’s own knowledge of the 
real state of things, that Nala was not dead and that, repenting his hasty 
abandonment of Damayanti, he was then making reproaches to himself and 
was in fact longing to meelt his lost Damayanti, had betrayed the poet into 
putting those words in the mouth of Sudeva, anticipating what was actually 
going to happen : a mistake common in the works of careless and inexperi- 
enced writers. 

That this also is not the correct explanation of the anomaly follows, how- 
ever, from the fact that almost all the lines forming this soliloquy of Sudeva 
recur almost verbatim in the long soliloquy of Hanumat in the Sundarak;^<Ja 
(adhy. 18 ff., ed. Gorresio) of the Rannayaija at the time when he first sees 
Sita in the Asoka grove of Havana's Lanka, — a soliloquy which, as will be 
made clear, is the source of the passage under discussion from the Nala 
episode. 

The two situations, it will be recalled, have a superficial similarity. The 
heroine is lost, and messengers have been sent, by persons interested in her 
recovery, to find out her whereabouts. One of these messengers, more fortu- 
nate than the rest, suddenly and unexpectedly lights upon her, whereupon 
he just stands gazing at her and giving vent to his mixed feelings of joy and 
sorrow in the form of a soliloquy. 

The one important difference between the two situations — ^a difference 
obviously overlooked by the adapter — is that in one case — ^the RamayaDa — 
the messenger, Hanumat, has been sent by Rama himself, and the messenger 
therefore knows exactly the state of the mind of the husband of the missing 
princess ; whereas in the other case, the Nala episode, the messenger, sent 
by king Bhima, has not only no knowledge of Nala's feelings towards Dama- 
yanti, but he does not even know whether Nala, who is missing, is alive or 
dead. And that makes a deal of difference. The words of the Ramaya’oa 
soliloquy are wholly .appropriate in the mouth of the Monkey Chieftain ;

but the same words, in spite of a few necessary verbal alterations made by 
the adapter, prove on close scrutiny, as shown above, just a trifle incongruous 
in the soliloquy of Sudeva. 

The extent of the similarity between the two passages will be clear from

The question which of the two passages is the original one, need not 
detain us long. It is a priori not very likely that Valnflki who is credited 
with having composed an epic of the size and rank of the Ramayaioa would 
need to borrow the idea or the phraseology of such a commonplace soliloquy 
from a poem like the Nalop^ySna. The redactor of the Nala story is, 
therefore, clearly indicated as the poet who would be under obligation for his 
inspiration td the Adi-kavi. This a priori conclusion is happily confirmed in 
the present instance by the fortuitous circumstance that the passage turns 
out to be somewhat of a misfit in <xir poem. The anomaly, as has been 
suggested above, can be explained only on the supposition that the Nalopakh- 
yana lines were borrowed m bloc from a slightly different context. The 
exact phrasing of the speech of the messenger was originally conceived for 
a somewhat different set of circumstances as pictured in the Rimaya^?a, in 
which the soliloquy fits perfectly. The borrowed plumes, as is very often 
the case, do not fit the new incumbent as well as the adapter had imagined 
or at least hoped. We have, therefore, here an indubitable proof of the direct 
borrowing of some Ramayama material by one of the Mahibharata poets.-— 


^ The correspcmding line has been omitted by GoRRESio, but is correctly given 
in the Bombay (Nimaya Sagar Press) ed. (1888), 5, 30, 7ab (cf. p. 83% and in the 
Gujarati Printing Press ed. (1916), 5. 30.. Tab (cf. p. 1856), both editions reading 
aham for our ayam. Both Tilaka and Govindaifijiya mention (the pratika) aivi^q- 
yami^ showing that they knew the stanza. 



THE NALA EPISOI* AND THE RAMAYAt^A 413 

not necessarily of course Krsija Dvaijrayana Vyiasa, but one of the “ Epigoni ”, 
the Vyasaids, who carried on the good work commenced by Vyiasa. 

The conclusion that the idea of this soliloquy of Sudeva in the Nalopakh- 
yana of the Mahabharata must necessarily have been bi^rrowed by one of 
the redactors of the Great Epic from the Ramayania is perhaps not without 
some significance for an understanding of the general interrelation of the 
Ramiaya|i^ and the Mahabharata to which we may here advert in passing. ^ 

The soliloquy discussed above is, as is well known, not by any means the 
only passage in which the Mahabharata, shows contact with its sister epic,^ 
and the question arises each time in the mind of the textual critic whether 
£301} the Mahabharata or the Ramayana is the source of the passage com- 
mon to the two epics, a question to whidi, owing to the peculiar character 
and development of the Indian epics, no general answer is possible, though 
a partial solution of the problem may be attempted. 

As remarked already, the Nala passage is not the only passage for which 
a parallel exists in the Ramayana. In the Adiparvan, for instance, in a cos- 
mogonic chapter, I had occasion to draw attention to the fact that a passage 
of some 30 lines (1. 60. 54-67 of the Critical Edition) recurs almost verbatim 
in the Ramayaioa (3. 14. 17-32, ed. Nirnaya Sagar Press). J^o definite evi- 
dence was available in that particular instance to show whether the passage 
was original to the Mahabharata and had been borrowed by the Ramayaina, 
or vice verm, or again whether it had been borrowed by both epics independ- 
ently from a third source. There seemed to me, however, to be some slight 
abruptness in the manner in which the stanzas were introduced in the Maha- 
bharata, which would suggest borrowing from the Riamayalna where the con- 
text isl smoother ; but, as the contents of the passage were of a! very general 
nature, the third possibility mentioned above, namely that both epics owed 
the idea to a common (Pun^nic) source, could not be entirely eliminated. 

The Sabhiaparvan again supplies the well known kaccit chapter (adhy. 
5), which has its counterpart in the Ramayana.^^ Here also the contents are 
of a very general character, having no direct bearing on the context of either 
the Ramayapa or the Mahabharata, and the whole passage could well have 
been adapted by both epics independently from an older Niti tractate. 

On the other hand, in the Aranyakaparvan, commonly known as the 

^ The question has been discussed at some lengfth by Hopkhns, The Great 
Epic of India, chapter 2 (“ Interrelation of the two Epics”) ; and by Winternitz,

THE NALA EPISODE AND THE RAMAYAl^A 

Vanaparvan, the Ramopakhyiana closely follows in general our Riamayaiia, 
notwithstanding some isolated though striking discrepancies between the two 
accounts.^ There are also not wanting in the Riamopakhylana a few of our 
genuine Ramiayapa stanzas which have been reproduced either verbatim or 
with but slight verbal alteration. To suggest that the Ramopiakhyana was 
the original source which had inspired the revered Adi-kavi to compose his 
Ramayaiia would be again a reductio ad absurdum. The inevitable con- 
clusidn is that the diaskeuasts of the Ramopakhyana knew and summarised 
an extensive older Ramai epic. The only doubt is whether the redactors of 
the Mahiabharata had utilized our version of the Ramiayaina or some other 
older version unknown to us, to which the discrepant traits of our episode 
might be traced. After an intensive study and a close comparison of the two 
texts, the late) Prof. Jacobi had definitely expressed himself in favour of the 
former alternative, namely, that the Ramopakhyana was a passably accurate 
summary of out Ramayaioa, the discrepancies between the accounts being 
due either to casual misconception or else to natural and unavoidable failure 
of memory, of which instances are common in summaries and abstracts.^ 
£3023 Jacobi’s view, it seems to me, now finds further confirmation from the 
instance discussed above of direct borrowing from our Ramiayana text in a 
case where there is no intrinsic reason whatsoever for airy reference to the 
Rjamayaoa at all. Evidence seems to be, therefore, gathering to show that 
our Rianrayaiiia text — or the bulk of it, at any rate — was used as a 
‘'source ” by the diaskeuasts of the Mahabhiarata. We can even go further 
and admit with Jacobi that the Ramayana must already have been ** gene- 
rally familiar as an ancient work before the Mahabharata reached its final 
form.’'^ On the other hand it will have to be admitted that the Maha- 
bharata makes in various ways a distinctly more archaic impression, a fact 
which has led some scholars to regard it als even a much older work than the 
other epic. We thus arrive at the apparent paradox that the Ramiayaijia is older 
than the Mahiabharata and the Mahabharata is older than the Ran^yania. 
The only way we can resolve this paradox is by supposing — ais has already 
been suggested by Winternitz^ and other writers on the subject — that the 
period* of composition of the Ramayana, which is a work with a distinctly 
more unitary character, falls within the much longer period of the evolution 
of the MahablSrata, which latter compared to the other is, a very complex 
and complicated work indeed.

THE NALA EPISODE AND THE RAMAYAI^A 


415 


This Statement of the relationship between the two epics will appear per» 
fectly valid and even natural when we remember that the evolution of the 
Great Epic of India falls into two distinct and separate phases, namely, the 
Bharata and the Mahabharata, the caturvimsatisSham (1. 1. 61 Crit Ed.) 
and the satasdhd^sn, a fact which is documented in very clear terms by the 
work itself — and there is no reason to disbelieve it — but which for some un- 
intelligible reason is not taken very seriously by people. Assuming, however, 
this to be a fact — which it undoubtedly is — ^we may hazard what seems to me 
to be a perfectly legitimate conjecture that the Rjamayana was composed in 
the interval which separated the Bharata from the Mahabharata. Thus, 
though we may admit that the Ramayana was, as Jacobi says, a well-known 
work before the Mahabharata reached its ultimate form, we must reckon with 
the possibility that when the Ramayana itself (minus perhaps Books 1 and 
7) was composed by the poet Valmiki, the heroic poem Bharata— the nucleus 
of our Mahabharata — ^was already long in existence, current perhaps in some 
distant part of the country and in a different milieu. The Bharata and the 
Ramayana may have been indeed more or less independent products, different 
in origin ar?d treatment. But when the Bhargava' redactors^ set to work and 
converted the {303} Bharata into the Mahabharata, conceived on a much 
larger scale and with a much more ambitious programme, they had already 
the archetype of our Ramayaija text before them and they made full use of it, 
absorbing in their own encyclopaedic work all that they possibly could, and 
they were perhaps also influenced by it in no small degree. In fact the very 
impetus to the conversion of the Bharata and the compilation of the Maha- 
bharata may well have been given by the contact with the sister epic, which 
appears to have had a more elevated ethical standard, a more serious didactic 
purpose, a much higher idealistic view of life, and a wider popular appeal. 

A priori then, whenever our Mahabharata shows close verbal agreement 
with the older books of the Ramayana, the presumption would be that we 
have to look upon the Ramayaiia as the source, assuming of course that the 
common element is not of such a character that it could have been borrowed 
by both epics independently from a third source. It is naturally not excluded 
that the Ram&yaija in its turn might have been influenced to a certain extent, 
at a still later epoch, in its further development, by the Mahabharata, the 
new encyclopaedic Dharma Sainhita. In fact there is every indication that 
the interrelation between the two epics will reduce itself to a very complicated 
system of mutual actions and reactions, and it would be interesting to investi- 
gate the question more fully by collation^ of all possible parallelisms in ideas 
and expression between the two great epics of India.
