## CXCVI

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
HOWRAH DIST., BENGAL,

*13th May 1901*.

DEAR CHRISTINE,

I arrived in the Math yesterday. This morning came your short note. You
must have got my letters by this time, and \[I\] hope this will give you
a taste of how sometimes silence is gold.

I have beautiful letters from everywhere this morning and am quite
happy. I paid a long visit of two months to Assam and different parts of
eastern Bengal. For combined mountain and water scenery, this part of
the country is unrivalled.

Either I am to go to Europe this summer, and thence to the U.S., or you
come over to India — things are all getting ready to that end. Mother
knows Her ways. For one thing, I am calm, very calm, and hope to keep a
hold on this state for a long time; and you are my best help to keep
this poise, are you not? I will write more in my next; just now these
few lines — and a hundred pardons I beg for their scantiness. Yet
silence tells more sometimes than all the speech in the world.

With all love and blessings,

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
