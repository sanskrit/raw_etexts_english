title = "03 Dr Ruben on the Critical Edition of the Malwbharata"

+++

I am bound to form and express an opinion on the issues raised in the
article Schwierigkeiten der Textkritik des Mahafcrfiarata published in the
current issue of the Acta Orimtalia (vol 8. pp. 240-256), in which the
author, Dr. Walter Ruben of the University of Bonn, has reviewed Fasci-
cules 1-3 of tny edition of the Adiparvan, criticizing at considerable length
and in great detail the principles underlying the preparation of the edition
and the constitution of the text.

From his discursive remarks it is indeed hazardous to say what precise
opinion Ruben has formed of the critical edition. But it seems to me that
his general verdict is anything but favourable.

It is not my intention to scrutinize every statement of the writer and
answer all his queries and criticisms ; nor is it incumbent on me to do so ; nor
even necessary, as will appear from the sequel. I shall confine my remarks
to a few points of outstanding importance in Ruben's paper which might mis-
lead the casual reader, creating an erroneous impression regarding the value
of the results achieved by the critical edition.

♦ * ♦

The Bogey of Classical Philology

At the beginning of his paper (p. 241), the learned reviewer from Bonn
formally recites the canon of the caturvarga of the Classical Philologist. The
Classical Philology, we are explained, distinguishes : 1. Heuristics, i.e. as-
sembling and arranging the entire material consisting of MSS. and testi-i
monia in the form of a genealogical tree ; 2. Recensio, i.e. restoration of the
text of the archetype ; 3. Etnendatio, i.e. restoration of the text of the author ;
4. “ Higher Criticism,” i.e. separation of the sources utilized by the author.

£260} Tested on this touchstone of the classicist, the critical edition
of the Mahabharata is found wanting in no less than three items, namely,
Nos. 1, 3 and 4. The third and the fourth items of the programme, R. pdnts
out, have been left wholly untouched ; even the first has by a long way not
been done full justice to by the hapless editor But as one reads on, one
finds that the dereliction is after all not as serious as one might be led to

tom.

suppose at first. For, as regards No. 1 (Heuristics), R. himself admits that
it is not yet possible to concentrate the entire material, and that in all likeli-
hood it will be for ever impossible to prepare a genealogical tree of the
Mahabharata MSS. — As for No. 3 (Emendaiia), I must plead guilty to
having perpetrated so far, perhaps somewhat unnecessarily, minor emenda-
tions in 13 instances^ in about 3800 stanzas ; that is, on an average 1 emen-
dation in a little under 300 stanzas, R. has not taken any notice of my con-
jectural corrections ; I take it that he approves of them. I feel greatly flat-
tered, I must confess, by R/s (implied) suggestion that I should have gone
in more systematically and vigorously for emendation. Most scholars will,
I fancy, be sincerely grateful that I have been so moderate and that I have
declared it as my policy to give preference to interpreitation over emenda-
tion.^ — In speaking at all of “ Higher Criticism” (No. 4 on the programme)
in this connection, R. seems to show a lamentable lack of understanding of
the objective of the edition, having mistaken evidently the beginning for the
end of the critical work on the Mahiabharata. Higher Criticism can begin
only after Lower Criticism has done its work, and not until then. And our
critical edition is just laying the foundation of the Lower Criticism of the
Great Epic. But I imagine, R. does not want to say anything special at all.
when he mentions his “Hohere Kritik'’. In the 1833 ^okas of the consti-
tuted text (!=2161 of the Bombay edition and 2208 of the Calcutta edition)
so closely investigated by R. in the preparation of his erudite paper, he does
not mention even a single passage where the ” Hohere Kritik ” could have
{261} earnestly and usefully ” functioned The item is probably introduced
here merely pro jorma, as the fourth and last stage of the ariya-magga.

But R. might have mercifully spared us this learned prooemium on the
aims and methods of the Classical Philology and their application to the
problem of the Mahabh^ata textual criticism. The same thing has been
said by others before R., more simply but with ample clearness and emphasis.
In the paper^ he read at the XVI Ith International Congress of Orientalists
(Oxford 1928), Winternitz remarked : “The general principles followed in
critical editions of classical texts, Greek or Latin or Sanskrit, can be applied
to a critical edition of the Mahiabharata only with great limitations and
modifications. It is simply impossible to trace a genealogical tree of all the
MSS. of the Adiparvan, and only in some cases are we able to state how
MSS. are related to one another. On the whole, we have to be satisfied with
a classification of the MSS. according to script, and the provinces to which
they belong. And we have more often to refer to classes of MSS., than to

individual MSS/'^ I had myself pointed out in the Foreword (p. ii) to
Fa^cule 1 that “ it is impossible to apply to the Mahabharata the special
canons of textual criticism which are derived from a study of classical (Greek
and Latin) texts and which depend ultimately upon there being a more or
less complete concatenation of copies and exemplars reaching finally back
to a single authentic (written) archetype'’.

And how would it be possible to apply to the Mahabharata the canons
of the Classical Philology in toto ? Where has the Classical Philology, I
should like to know, the necessary experience of dealing with a text with
about a dozen recensions whose extreme types differ in extent by something
like 13,000 stanzas (or 26,000 lines) ; a work which for centuries has been
growing not only upwards and downwards but also laterally, like the Nyag-
rodha tree, growing on all sides ; a codex which has been written in seven
or eight different scripts, assiduously and lovingly copied through a long
vista of centuries by a legion of devout — and perhaps mostly ignorant
{262} and inefficient^ — copyists speaking different tongues ; a traditional book
of inspiration which, in various shapes and sizes, has been the cherished
heritage of one people continuously for several millennia and which to the
present day is interwoven with the thoughts and beliefs and moral ideas of a
nation numbering over two hundred million? No, the Classical Philology
has no experience in dealing with a text of this description, a work of such
colossal dimensions and complex character, with such a long and intricate
history behind it. That is why I have elsewhere also said that the problem
of the Mahabharata textual criticism is a problem sui generis.^ The method
of the Mahabharata textual criticism must be evolved from a special study
of the Mahabharata manuscripts and of the Mahabharata manuscript tradi-
tion. Its results and achievements can be judged only by a standard of its
own.

Ruben’s Exaggerations and Generalizations

In his endeavour to maintain consistently an attitude of dogmatic doubt,
R. has been unconsciously led to make wild exaggerations and rash generali-
zations, which such a meticulous and captious critic as R. should have taken
pains to avoid.

Thus in one place (p. 242), R, observes that the iSarada MS., as a mat-
ter of fact, does not differ at all from other MSS. ! As a matter of fact,
this stat^ent of R. is demonstrably false. If a difference of something like
1000 stanzas (which is probably the difference between the garada and tt.e

KJ has first copied the reverse of the folio of his exemplar and then the ob-
verse !

Grantha versions of the Adiparvan), not to speak of innumerable minor var-
iants, is no difference, I should like to know what, in the opinion of R.,
would constitute a difference. Did R. expect that the Kasmiri Mahabharata
would be a poem of 8800 slokas in Old Prakrit in which Krsna was still a
tribal hero ?

On p. 253, R. remarks that every contextual criterion is problematic.’ This
is a rash generalization. In the Editorial Note (3) appended to Fasciaale
4, I have now pointed out (p. ii f.) three passages for which there is the
strongest in- {263} -trinsic probability, amounting to certainty, that they are
interpolations in the recension in which they are found. All three are instan-
ces in which according to the Northern recension the parties to be married were
united only by a shadowy and clandestine form of marriage known as the
Gandharva-vivaha, which is no marriage at all, while according to the Sou-
thern recension (respectively, in one case, the Grantha version c«ily) the
same parties were married, so to say, in church, in due form, with great pomp
and ceremony. I .maintain that at least in these three instances the crite-
rion of the intrinsic probability is not at all problematic. I challenge R. to
prove the contrary.

I shall mention only one other interesting instance of intrinsic proba-
bility. In the Paulomaparvan, Ruru, while praying for the life of his wife,
who has just died from the bite of a venomous serpent, says (1. 9. 4-5) :

“ If I have (practised) charity, (if I have) practised penance, if I have
duly served (my) Gurus, then on account of that (merit of these virtuous
acts) let my beloved be restored to life ! As from (the moment of) my birth
I have restrained myself and maintained my vows, so let the beautiful Pra-
madvara even now arise ! ”

The fulfilment of Rum’s fervent utterance is thought to be due merely
to the efficacy of his pious acts in the past : they by themselves operate as
a charm or spell to restore to life the dead Pramadvara. This is a form of
an impersonal ” prayer belonging to a comparatively older stratum of reli-
gious life and thought, which would never occur to an ordinary interpolator.
At this place, Gj. 2. 4 r, have some additional lines including the following
prayer (233*).

“ If my faith in Kr§|ija, Vi§nu, Hr§ike^, the Lord of the Worlds, the
Foe of the Asuras, unshakable, then let this beloved of mine be restored to
life !

This belongs to a later stratum, the period of the Bhakti cult. This is
just the thing that would be interpolated by a devout Vaisnava, to whom the
former prayer would be meaningless and unintelligible.

I maintain that here also the intrinsic probability as to what is original

and what is interpolation is so strong as to be conclusive in favour of the text
and against G j. 2 . 4 . 5 - No £264} one with a modicum of the historical sense
can doubt it. Can R. adduce even a shadow of a reason to show that the
intrinsic evidence in this insitance is in any degree problematic? Scores of
illustrations of this character may be produced where the contextual evidence
is not problematic at all, but quite definite and conclusive.^

R. (p. 254) has magnanimously set the seal of his approval on “Die
Sage von Rsyasrhga by Professor Luecrs ® citing it approvingly as a piece
of investigation that belongs to the coveted domain of emendetio. It is un-
questionably that. Had R. now thought over the question a little more
deeply than he appears to have done, he would have easily perceived that
the whole thesis of “ Die Sage von R§ya^ga ” rests on the exploitation of in-
trinsic probability. There was, in fact, nothing else except the vulgate text
before Prof. Lum:rs when he framed his brilliant hypothesis about the diffe-
rent strata and the cross-currents in the Mahabharata version of that l^end.
If now every contextual criterion is so very problematic, then what is the va-
lue, may I ask, of Prof. Luders’s monograph, which R. professes to admire so
fervently? R. has been contradicting himself in one and the same para-
graph (p. 253 f.).

Theoretically considered also, R.*s proposition is untenable. When a text
has been tampered with on a large scale, however careful and however ac-
complished the interpolator may be, it is inconceivable that all the frills,
patches and paddings added by the interpolator should remain for all time
incapable of detection. It is inevitable that the interpolator should bungle
something somewhere, produce a misfit, leave raw edges which do not meet.
Therefore R.'s dictum (p. 253) “ebenso problematisch ist schliesslich ;c-
de^ inhaltliche Kriterium” is, in the form in which he has put it, funda-
mentally wrong and is to be unhesitatingly rejected.

Here is another instance of R.’s misstatdnents. On p. 242 he observes
that among the fifty MSS. collated for the Adiparvan £265} there are not
even two that may be directly connected with each other. This is of course
a wild exaggeration. The two Arjunami^ra MSS. show inter se no more
difference than any two (carelessly made) copies of an original would show ;
as a matter of fact— but this could not have been known to R.— they agree
almost page for page. If they were not copied from the same original, their
respective exemplars could not have differed from each other very consider-


^ For instance, it is on grounds of intrinsic probability that Prof. LOders
{DLZ^ Heft 24, Sp. 1142 f.) decides for and defencte the reading amytam of the
constituted t&ct (1. 1. 201). Here the documentary evidence is inoonclumve, but
Prof. LOders isf on that account in no doubt as to which the true reading is,

ably. The same is the case with the three Nilakai^tha MSS. The MSS. of
the text as fixed by commentators (like Arjunami^ra and NUakaotha) are,
in general, as like as two peas. The number of such replicas can be increased
almost indefinitely. I have intentionally restricted their number to the mini-
mum necessary for fixing the text of the respective versions, always giving
preference to a divergent type. But even apart from such texts with com-
mentaries, there is considerable similarity and kinship to be noticed among
the different MSS. In the Editorial Note (2) appended to Fascicule 3
(p. ii), I have demonstrated the kinship between and K^. I pointed out
there that “the India Office codex must be a transcript not merely of a
iSarada codex, but, as a careful comparison with Sj would show, of an ex-
emplar very closely allied to mr fSarada codex This conclusion is supported
by numerous other agreements throughout the Adiparvan. That the three
new Malayalam MSS. M^. s again go back to the same original follows
not merely from the numerous readings these MSS. have in common, but
conspicuously from one particular mistake where they repeat inconsequen-
tially, at the same point, a fragment of a stanza (1. 85. 25) : pujayantlha loke
ndsddhava}}. Further the four Grantha MSS. Gj. 2. 4. u. (which will come
up for detailed discussion below) must go back to a not very distant com-
mon original. This group has not only numerous readings in common, but
it contains quite a considerable numbef of interpolations peculiar to itself.^
Their close affinity is, however, placed beyond the pale of reasonable doubt
by the fact that they all contain a stanza (294*) interpolated at a place where
it is, as will presently be shown, so thoroughly irrelevant that with it the pas-
sage does not construe even !

It will thus be seen that these generalizations of R. are absolutely un-*
warranted. They appear to have been introduced £266} by R, merely for
the satisfaction of having made some pointed and effective little statement.

The Four Types of Variants.

After pointing out that no pedigree of the Mahabharata MSS. is pos-
sible, R. proceeds (p. 243) to consider the different types of characteristic
combinations £tmong the variants, whose consideration must take the place
of the formation of the usual genealogical tree. He distinguishes four diffe-
rent types of constellations. They are as follows : 1. Complete Agree-

ment, where tlie two recensions N and S register one concordant reading ;
2. No Agreement, where N and S stand opposite to each other with two
   divergent readings ; 3. Cross- Agreement, where a part of N agrees with a
   part of S against the rest of N, which latter agrees with the r^t of S ; 4.
   Partial Agreement, where a part of N stands against S and the rest of N (or
   vice versa).

Diagrammatically the four types of constellations may be represented

thus.


Type No. 1 : Complete Agreement :

N = S

Type No. 2 : No Agreement :

N

Type No. 3 : Cross- Agreement :


Type No. 4 : Pmtial Agreement :

N, .No 1 N.
s/ 1 s,\so


Type No. 1 (N=S). In this case 1 have assumed that the concordant
reading of N and S must be postulated as having already belonged to the
archetype. To my proposition R. adds the rider that there is a possibility
that even such a concordant reading (or feature) might have been an inno-
vation made in one recension and then borrowed in toto by the other recen-
sion. He cites (p. 244) Ramiyana, Ayodhya 6 (Bombay ed.), which (ac-
cording to R.) is an interpolation in one recension, which had been borrowed
en bloc by the other (independent) recension. R.’s proposition would be a
contradiction in terms ; only he takes care not to put forward the proposition
in this form.

If the two recensions N and S of the Mahabharata should have an in-
terpolation in common, they would not be (truly) independent. But these
recensions must be assumed to be independent, and R. would not be able to
prove any second-{267}ary interrelationship ” between N as a whole and
S as a whole, at least for the Adiparvan. Should there be found a passage
which stands in such an apparent disagreement with the context that it may
(a priori) be regarded as an interpolation, it would be no more difficult-
in fact it would be, in my opinion, far easier and much more natural— to as-
sume that the contradiction was already present in the archetype,” before
the bifurcation of the recensions than to premise that one independent re-
cension had borrowed it from another independent recension.

For example, adhyayas 1 and 4 of the Adiparvan begin with the iden-
tical sentence, depicting the identical situation, that the Suta approaches the
R§is assembled in the Naimi^a forest at the twelve-year sacrificial session of
Saunaka. This implies that a new beginning is made at adhyiaya 4, totally
ignoring whatever has gone before it in the text as it now stands. Both pas-
sages occur with minimal variations in both recensions. It is evident that
this double b^inning (adhy. 1 and 4), as we find it in our version of the
Mahabharata, was not conceived and depicted by one and the same poet.
But it does not at all follow therefore that the interpolation was first made
in one recension of our text and was subsequently borrowed by the other
from this recension. There are various possibilities.^ Perhaps both versions

of the beginning lay before the diaskaiasts of the last redaction of the Ma-
liabharata : one giving the very useful table of contents, the other containing
some interesting old tales of gods, IJ§is and serpents. They were not consistent
in juxtaposition, but each was too good to lose. The redactors put both in,
making but a poor compromise. This is one possibility. The other possi-
bility is that one of these sections was composed and tacked on to an existing
version of the beginning by the diaskeuasts of the last redaction themselves,
using the same opening device. That would only show — ^as R. himself con-
cedes in another connection (p. 254) — ^that though we might regard the ori-
ginal epic as a more or less homogeneous £268} work, the archetype of our
MSS. already contained some inconsistencies and contradictions.^

Type No. 2 (N#S). I agree with R. that when there is a conflict between
N and S and they stand opposite to each other with two divergent readings,
no definite decision is, in general, possible as to which is the original ; the
versions should a priori be placed on an equal footing and treated with im-
partiality Accordingly, in such cases, I have adopted as stop-gap the
reading of N, placing a wavy line below it, to show that the reading is uncer-
tain. R. mentions an exception to this procedure of mine, but
the exception is only apparent. R. has failed to understand my motives in
departing from my usual practice in the solitary instance of the benedic-
tory stanza with which the epic begins {Nardyaf^am nama^krtya etc.). I
have printed it above the line not because it is found in K o.i or in K or even
in N, but simply as a mahgala. I am aware that the stanza is missing in S.
There is, therefore, every probability that it did not belong to the archer
type. I am also fully aiware that the stanza is a characteristic mark of the
works of the Bhagavata sect and not peculiar to the Mahabharata.^ There is,
however, the fact that all our MSS. of the Adiparvan begin with some bene-
dictory stanza. These stanzas have probably iisurped now the place of some
simpler mahgala with which the epic once began. No orthodox Hindu work
can begin without a mahgala ; and this edition of the Mahiabharata, critical
though it be, is and remains a Hindu work, which could not dispense w^lh


1 For instance, the story of the birth of Bhi^ma contains a patent contradic-
tion. The reason why the Vasus were cursed by Vaisi§tha as given in adhy. 91
( 1 = 96 of the Bombay text) is quite different from and inconsistent with that
given in adhy. 93 (=99 of the Bombay text). Both versions occur, in substan-
tially identical form, in both recensions.— Cf. also the passage regarding the eight
forms of marriage (1. 67. 8-12) in the 8akuntala episode. The passage is made
up of two different and mutually inconsistent systems of rules, taken from two
different sources, lied and \2ab have been borrowed from a context which men-
tions only five forms of marriages ; cf. (K.) 13. 79. 9 and Dahlmann, Das Ma-
hdbhdrata pp. 203 ff. The same passage, with some variation, but with the same
inconsistency, occurs in Manu (3. 21-26) .

a irangala. My recognition of the unoiriginal dtaracter of the stanza is,
however dearly implied by the fact that I have omitted to give the £269}
stanza a number, differing in this respect con^icuously from the earlier edi-
tions, which treat it as the first stanza of the epic and an integral part of the
text.


The Position oj 3,4

One of the most perplexing forms of variation in the Mahabharata text is
Type No. 4, namdy. Partial Agreement. The critical apparatus is a verit-
able labyrinth of duplicated and intermingled versions, each with a Icaig
and intricate history of its own behind it. We have unfortunately no single
thread to guide us out of the maze, but rather a multitude of strands inter-
twined and entangled and leading along divergent paths. How difficult it
is to find one’s way in this maze may be realized from the fact that so pains-
taking and able a critic as R., despite his close and conscientious study of
the critical apparatus, could totally lose his bearings the moment the network
gets a little more complicated than usual.

The really petidexing part of the whole tangle is that while the agree-
ments of Sj Kj with S are mostly authentic and fundamental, those of
Gi. 2 . 4 . 5 with N are mostly secondary and spurious. Let us first consider
the position of the group 2 . 4 , 5 . which appears to have caused R. most
trouble. I shall state the case as it has been put forward by R. himself
(p. 249 f.).

Supanjadhyaya 19 contains a conversation of Garuda with his father
Kasyapa. Garuda introduces himself as patatam varistha and makes some
polite inquiries regarding his father {kaccid vas tdta kusalam gfhe^u) and his
mother {kaccit. . .mM\d na socati). The father replies that they are doing
well at home {vedaham eM kusalam gjhe^u) and then pronounces a blessing
on Garuda .tv a rak?atu. . .jco yajum^i ; thoi svastyayanam) . This con-
versation assumes in the Mahatriiarata (1. 25. 7-25) the following form.
Garuda asks his father for some new and substantial food and the father re-
commends the mammoth elerrfiant and tortoise (as in Supamja 13. 1 f. Ga-
ruda’s mother does) and proceeds to relate their history. In this scene
the contents of the Supaii). are to be found in the “ interpolated ” verses
(here adapted to the iww contents). In the beginning (324*; Ko. 3.4 N V,
B D Tj), the father asks Garuda if he is doing well “ in respect of food ”*
{kaccid vah kuialam £270} nityam bhojane) ; the three lines of this N in-
terpolation (says R.) correspond to the equally long S interpdation (326*:


1 This is R.’s rendering (“ fragt nach seinem Wohlergehen ‘ in Bezug auf das
Essen’”); but he has evidently misunderstood the line, vrfiich may be translated
thus: “Have you (all) been doing well? (have you had) always plenty of
food?”.

Gi. 2. 4. s)* which Garuda introduces himself as pMatdm srestha. In
both these N and S groups there follows a common interpolation (327*) in
which Garuda says that his mother is well (mdtd me kusald)^ etc. At the
end of the scene follows in these MSS. (N Vj B D Gj. 2. 4. 5 J ^2 4

only partly) the blessings of the father (335* svastyaymam. . ,rco ya-

jumsi),

Garuda has stolen the Amrta ; Indra hurls at him his Vajra ; Garuda
shows his strength and drops just one feather (Mbh. 1. 29. 19 = Supan.i.
27. 6). Mbh. 1. 29. 23 is similar to Supami. 28. 2 (Indra then tries to
    make friends with Garuda); Suparn. 28. 3 is similar to Mbh. 1. 30. 4 ff.
    (Garuda boasts about his great strength) In Suparp. 28. 1 it is narrated
    that out of Garuda’s feather, which had split in three parts {chirmmh tridhd
    tat kuUsena palram), there sprang the peacock, the “two-mouthed serpent-
    lords” and the mongoose. The last three padas of this stanza are interpo
    lated at this place in Ko. 4 (358*); the first finds an echo in 361*, an inter-
    polatbn of Ty Gi.2,4.r, itndhd kyiva tadd vajram), Kn 4 has then further
    actually cited verbatim Suparn. 28. 3 in 365*.

R. adnuts that in the second scene K0.4 unquestionably cite Supani.
F'urther 361*, according to R again, is to be judged similarly. That is an
interpolation in the S MSS., the same stanza of the Suparp. (28. 1) having
hover^ before the eyes of the interpolators as in the case of those who in-
terpolated 358* in Ko .4 After pointing out all this R. asks : “ Should one
now regard the first scene also as an interpolation made independently in N
and S ? Consider that Gj. 2. 4. s agree quite frequently in this episode with
N (1. 20. 15 ; 301* ; 329*; 343*), that they alone have a remarkably large
number of interpolations, and that 340* is found only G^. 2. 4. r> M and cor-
responds to Suparn, 13, 4 Has the G group then £271} interpolated the

passage under the influence of the Supanj. and in its turn influenced the N
groups? Su[kthankar] gives in 1, 20. 1 the diametrically opposite answer
with an assurance which is out of place in such difficult passages. It cannot
even be strictly proved that these “ interpolations in the first scene, which
are common to N and S, are not. m old remnant of the archetype/’

There are in the Adiparvan far more complicated passages than this :
this is one of the simpler complications. I shudder at the thought of what


1 It is by no means certain that (as R. sayaf, p. 249) the stanzas which are
common to the Mbh. and the Suparp. have been borrowed by the Suparp. from the
Mbh. I believe, on the contrary, that the Suparp, has to be looked upon here as
the source from which the stanza in question have been taken over by the epic.
Four of the stanzas are nearly identical' in the two works, because they occur as §Io-
kas in the Suparn, and could be utilized by tlie redactors of tlie epic version with-
out ch^i^e of metre and with some trifling change of language.

conflation.^ In the present case, it can, as it happens, be stTictly proved
that the doubtful passages of the first scene, which are common to certain N
groups and S groups, are interpolations and no rest of the archetype. Also
I may repeat here most emphatically what I have said in the note on 1. 20. 1
that the irrelevant insertion of 294* in Gj. 2 . 4 . 5 is irrefutable evidence of the
contamination of these four Grantha MSS. from late Northern sources.

We shall consider the second point first. I imagine, R. has misunder-
stood or overlooked the little word “ irrelevantly ” in my note on 1 . 20 . 1 .
Otherwise he would have tried to visualize the passage, by reconstructing it
carefully from the critical notes, and then he would have surely come to the
same conclusion as I . All that is necessary in order to prove that 294’* is
an interpolation in the Grantha group is to cite the passage in extenso. Here
is a transcript of the passage as it is found in G 2 , the better preserved of
the two Grantha MSS. belonging to the Bombay Government collection, col-
lated for the Adiparvan.

Even a cursory reading of the passage will show that lines 7-3 of this
passage (which constitute 294*) are thoroughly irrelevant here. The lines
comprise merely a string of attributes of Garuda. There is no finite verb in

the sentence and there is no reference to Garuda in the foregoing or follow-
ing lines. The only rational explanation of this state of things is that the
lines were interpolated in an ancestor of G^, 2. 4. 5 by a clumsy copyist, who
had missed the right place by four stanzas. Such mistakes occur frequently
in Indian MSS. because the additional lines were, as a rule, first written in
the narrow margin of the MS. and a small mark was made to indicate the
point of insertion. Should the mark get obliterated, the lines would be in-
serted by the next copyist wherever he considered they belonged or fitted
best. If those lines (294*) belonged to the archetype of our MSS. we
should have to assume that they were accidentally mis-placed in a sub-group
of the Grantha version, omitted (for an unknown reason) in another group
of MSSw K1.3 D2 M and are found in their correct place only in

^^0.2.4 Vi B D (except D2). Is this plausible? I can hardly think that R.
would say so. I am inclined to believe that R. had failed to realize how the
passage actually read in this particular sub-group of the Grantha version.
Taking all things into consideration, it is difficult to escape from the con-
clusion that an ancestor of the Grantha sub-group had been compared with
some MS. or MSS. of the Northern recension which contained the spurious
passage 294*. This is the first important fact to remember with regard to
this interesting sub-^roup of the Grantha version. It is quite in harmony
with £273} the other fact that this group contains 25 interpolated passages
in 52 adhyayas (24-75) or about 2()()0 stanzas, which have not been found
so far anywhere else. They are : 320*, 322*, 326*, 330*, 337*, 345*, 351*
(tliird line!), 357*, 363*, 364*, 368*, 371*, 373*, 382*, 386*, 387*, 388*,
406*, 519*, 584*, 636*, 705*, 706*, 741*, 755*. This group moreover con-
tains in the same section the following 10 passages which it shares only with
two or three other MSS. (in some written only on the margin) : 312*, 348*,
353*, 399*, 4104*, 421*, 423*, 442*, 469* (phalasruti !), 831*. How these
passages originate is somewhat of , a mystery. But as no one would be so
inane as to maintain that these are rests of the archetype preserved only in
a sub-group of the Grantha version and lost without a trace elsewhere, not
only in the remaining MSS. of the Grantha version but in all other versions
of both recensions as well, we are inevitably led to the conclusion that this
sub-group of the Grantha version must present a text exceptionally heavily
padded with indiscriminate additions. This noteworthy fact renders its ag-
reements with N immediately suspect. And a priori also it is more likely
that, when there is agreement between a sub-group of one version and some
aatirely different version or versions, the sub-group is the borrower. It may
further be pointed out that 294* is by a long way not the only passage which
this sub-group of the Grantha version shares with the vulgate text, against
the rest of the Grantha version together with the iSarada-Kasmiii and the
Malayalatn versions. Here is a list of these passages (in adhyayas 20-43),
which must all be assumed to be interpolated in the sub-group in question
16a

tPtC STUDIES


under the influence of some MS. or MSS. on which the text of the vulgate
is based, that is, of some late Northern sources.: 294*, 301*, 307*, 327*,
329*, 335*, ‘341*, 343*, 355*, 385*, 392*, 393*, 396*, 402*. 411*, 419*,
etc.

After this preamble we may proceed to consider the case of the Su-
parn. passage. Here the indebtedness of 2 . 4 . s to the Northern recen-
sion is equally dear and would have been manifest to R., had he but attempt-
ed to visualize the whole passage as it stands in the sub-group instead of
contenting himsdf with merely counting the number of lines. R.’s initial
mistake lies in thinking that 324* and 326* are equivalent passages, whereas
the passages, although of the same length and inserted at the same point,
are utterly different in contents and have an entirely different significance.
The passage 324* {274} contains a kusala-question and an inquiry as to whe-
ther Garuda gets enough to eat ; 326*, on the other hand, contains a question
as to where Garuda is going in such hurry ! Remembering this and reading
the various passages together, the relationship between the MSS. will be
clear. It is again a case of irrelevant insertion in the conflated group. The
passage in question reads in the different MS. groups as under.

Placed in this way, the reader will see at a glance that while 327* is a
proper rejoinder to the query in 324,* it is totally irrelevant after 326*; be-
cause in Gg. 4 . 5 » in reply to Kasyapa's question where Garuda is going, Ga-
ruda says My mother is well, so is my brother, and so am I ” etc. This
clearly shows that in Q 2 4 . 6 » 327* is a secondary interpolation. Then the
question arises whether 326* could be a rest of the archetype. The probabi-
lity of this being so is reduced to nil not merely by the fact that the passage
is found only in the highly inflated group G,. 2 . 4 5 ^ but also from the iK)te-
worthy circumstances (which I fear has escaped the vigilant R/) that in



EPIC STUDIES III


239


Gi. 2. 4. 6, has been altered from pr^tm cdhhydtavdn pituh, to Kdsyapam
dlptatejasam in order to accommodate the additional lines. In any case
these interpolations are not common to N and S, as erroneously believed by R.

The history of these interpolations must be something like the following.
The question (which is missing in S except T^) and the answer (which is
found only in Ti Gg. 4. 5 of the S MSS.) regarding Garuda's gastronomic
requirements (324* and 327*) were interpolated in a part of N (namely,
the base of the vul-{275}gate), inspired by SuparQ. 19. 2. Independently
there was inserted in G^ 2. 4. ^ question by Kasyapa (“ Where are you

going with such speed ? ”) in anticipation of the reply of Garuda in 1. 25, 7
cd, an interpolation which probably has nothing to do with the Supanj.
Subsequently, after comparison with some MS. or MSS. of the N recension,
the answer of Garuda 327* (which, as I have remarked above, fits only to the
question in 324* ) was irrelevantly added in an ancestor of Gi 2. 4. 5 by an
ignorant copyist after 326*, where it does not fit in the least ! This second
mistake of the copyist of an ancestor of Gi 2. 4. 5 is another valuable piece of
irrefutable evidence of the contamination of these four G MSS. from some
late Northern source.

I have remarked above that the mangalya or s vasty ayana (335*) before
1. 25, 26 must also be regarded as an interpolation. This follows for one
   thing from the MS. evidence, and is corroborated by the fact that the words
   of the suta : sa tac chrutvd pitur vdkyam refer clearly to Ka^yapa’s directions
   as to what Garuda should next do and ignore the intervening the long man-
   gaJya altogether. That is why the vulgate alters srutvd to smrtvd !

The reader need be not sceptical about the possibilities of such indiscrimi-
nate conflation and addition. The critical apparatus, if closely scrutinized
and properly understood, will reveal numerous instances of a similar charac-
ter. Even a close study of the Kumbhakonam edition, prepared in our own
times by two excellent Southern Pandits, will throw some light on the men-
tality of the old redactors of the Mahabhiarata : parallel and even contradic-
tory versions are placed quite unconcernedly side by side, regardless of the
effect on the reader, regardless of the fact that sentences are left hanging in the
air, that passages do not construe. Here one notices above all the anxiety
that nothing that was by any chance found in a Mahabharata MS. should
be lost. Everything was carefully preserved, assembled in a picturesque dis-
array. The guiding principle was to make the Mahabhiarata a “ thesaurus
of all excellences, ” culled no matter from what source. At the beginning of
his commentary on the Sanatsujatiya,^ Nilakantha naively remarks :

EPIC STUDIES


That is why it is safe to assume that far more stanzas must have been
added to the Great Epic than omitted from it. It follows from this as a co-
rollary that the archetype must almost completely— if not quite completely —
be contained in the extant MSS.^

It will thus be seen that the assurance with which I have spoken (in the
note on 1. 20. 1) of the contamination of Gj. o. 4 . s fi^orn late Northern sour-
ces is amply justified ; and that the passages common to this sub-groip and
the vulgate text (324*, 326*, 327*) mentioned by R. are in fact interpolations
and no remnants of the archetype.

The Position of K.

If I understand R. (v. 248, lines 1-3) right — his remarks are somewhat
confused — ^he questions the propriety of my treating the concordant readings
of the Southern recension and the Kalsmirl (Sarada) version (against the
rest of N) as original readings. But in the course of the same paragraph,
he expresses his unqualified approval of the procedure of Prof. Luders in
accepting as original the ccwisensus of G and B (against the rest of N). Now,
as a matter of documentary probability, there is no difference whatsoever
between the consensus of K and S against B D on the one hand and the
consensus of B and G against D on the other ; because the relationship bet-
ween the different versions must be one of the following type :

Ur-Mahabharata


N S

I _

X

i I 1 r T ^1

(-K) *N 'D -T -G *M

where X is the intermediate archetype of the vulgate, iid *K, *B, etc. are
the (uncontaminated) archetypes of K, B, etc.

£277} If Prof. Luders gives preference to the consensus of B and C
against the D MSS., it is to be presumed that he would likewise give prefer,
ence to the consensus of K and S against B (with or without D) , Let us see
what Prof. Luders himself has to say on the point

“ . . . . Dagegen ist es sehr erfreulich zu horen, dass von Adhy. 26 an noch
ein altes iSarada-Manuskript auf Birkenrinde zu Gebote steht, voraussichtlich
der einzige vollkommen echte Vertreter der Klasmiri-Version.

stimmen aber die siidlichen Handschriften so genau iiberein wie mit der
KaSlmri- Version. Andererseits zeigt diese keine der offenkundigen Zusatze
der siidlichen Rezension. Die raumlich weite Getrenntheit der beiden Hand-
schriftengruppen schliesst die direkte Abhtogigkei der siidlichen Rezmsion
von der Kasmln-Version nahezu aus. Es ist daher anzunehmen, dass da, wo
die beiden in Lesknten zusammenstimrnen, die Lesmgen des dltesten Textes,
der erreichbar ist, vorliegen. Zu dieser Beurteilung des Verhdltnisses der
Kdsmlrl und der sudlichen Handschriften, die Sukthankar vertritt, war ouch
ich hereits bei der tierstelhmg der Druckprobe gelangt,^ wenn mir auch von
der Kasmiri-Version nur die ziemlich nachlassig geschriebene Handschrift der
Bibliothek des India Office 2137 yorlag. . . . Selbstverstandlich kann auch die
Ka§miri-jVersion Textanderungen enthalten, und der Herausgeber ist meines
Erachtens im Rechte, wenn er gelegentlich der Bangali-Version, mit der die
Maithili- Version und der Text des Arjunalnisra in allgemeinen zusammen-
gehen, da wo sie mit den sudlichen Handschriften iibereinstimmt, den Vorzug
gegeben hat.”

Prof. Luders, in other words, unhesitatingly endorses my procedure.
Herr Dr. R-jben dissents ! I am content to leave it at that.

The Extent of the Virdtaparvan

When I adopted 2050 as the figure^ representing the extent of the Vimta-
parvan, I did not do so, as R. says (p. 251), £278} under the influence of
Utgikar or anybody else. My chief reason for adopting the figure was that
it represents the reading of the majority of K supported by the Maithili
MS. (Vi) and Nilakaiotha version (Dn). When Nilakaiptha adopts it,
there is a certain amount of probability of its being well represented in the
old Northern MSS, of his time. I cannot say whether R. knows that it is the
reading of all printed editions as well ; it looks as though he does not.

Now let us consider the claims of the other variants. S has an obviously
inflated text.'* This inflated text appears to have been recounted in the South
by the diaskeuasts and the Parvasamgraha figure altered accordingly to 3500.'^
So the reading of S may be left out of consideration altogether. The other
Northern variants are as follows :

2015 : q=5I^ 5 K*

2300 • 5Pr ^ Ki Vim B 2 . 3 . 4 m D 7 . u

2500 : ii?sr ^ B 4 Ds

Only one thing that is plain in the midst of the prevailing confusion is
that the text has been counted and the figure adjusted more than once. The
pancadasmva of Kj, however, is obviously only a corruption of poncasod eva
of the text.^ Thus the text reading represents the reading of K except Ko.i.
There is no adequate reason for giving preference here to the readings of Ko
or Kj, because they not only disagree among themselves, but each finds only
desultOTy support from other Northern MSS. What could the editor do under
these circumstances but leave the reading of the vulgate (supported by the
majority of K) in possession and mark it as doubtful? The text figure
appears, however, in a certain measure, to be supported and even made prob-
able by the facts of the case ; because there are in existence, as a matter of
fact, a few MSS. of the textus simplkior (F A M)^— and with the constantly
operating £279"} urge towards inflation their number will be necessarily small
—which are approximately of that length.

The figure 2500, I must confess, I cannot adequately explain.® But as
regards 2300, which approximately represents the extent of the vulgate text
and which is documented by Bj, 3 . « m among others, one may hazard the
guess that it represents the measure of the text of that section of the Bangali
version in which the Kali (or Durga) hymn had been first interpolated along
with some other accretions. All things considered, I think I was perfectly
justified in adopting in the Parvasamgraha the reading which I did adopt.

What R. meaiis^ by saying (p. 251) that the reading of the archetype
night have been :

^N3[RTri5l: ^ I

is beyond my comprehension. Does he mean that I should have set this
(imaginary) line in the constituted text in place of the one which I have,
or does he only want to show that he can compose an Anui^tubh line ? If it
is the latter, I will readily admit that the line is metrically, grammatically
and stylistically impeccable, and does him credit. As we do not, however,
want to rewrite the Mahabharata, such manufa!ctured lines have no value
for us. The only sound test of the correctness of a reading is the evidence

of MSS. In overriding this evidence, R. is unguardedly opening wide the
door to a subjective Hohere Kritik which is the only thing that we must
rigorously avoid doing at this stage of the Mahiabhiarata studies and which
R. would be the first to deprecate if any one else were to attempt it.

Ruben constitutes the Text

At the end of his paper R. has appended, as a specimen, the text of 3
stanzas (1. 26. 1-3), as it should be constituted. The reader who has waded
through 15 pages of R.'s disquisition on the complicacies of the Mahabharata
textual criticism will be amazed to discover that notwithstanding the over-
whelming mass of variants and additional ” lines which stand at the
£280} disposal of the exacting critic and despite the alarming theoretical
doubts and scruples expressed by R. in the earlier part of his paper, his con-
stituted text differs from mine principally in the readings of two ak^aras, and
-the addition of a line which he himself subsequently (p. 256) admits to be
a probable interpolation ! The difference between our readings is as follow's.
In line 1 he hesitatingly sets ""mdtre^ for my °mdtrd, and in line 3 bhonktva
for my bhagndm. R. (doubtfully) decides in favour of °mdtre on the ground
that it is a lectio difficilior and according to R. himself — of course in another
place (p. 253) — the criterion of the lect. diff. is problematic and proves
nothing. Here is a neat little paradox : R. prefers the lect. diff. and sets it
in the text, because the criterion of the lect. diff. is problematic and proves
nothing ! — As regards the second word, R. admits that though he prefers
bhahktvd, the differentiation from (an original) bhagndm to bhmiktvd may
be an innovation (p, 256).

The other difference in the text as constituted by R. and by me lies in
the underlining of the uncertain parts of the text. Let me at once admit that
I have been rather remiss in showing the uncertain portions in this passage.
The device is a practical makeshift and by its very nature hard to apply
strictly and consistently. But the difficulty is not solved by R.’s marking
below the text wavy and straight, single and double lines, in season and out
of season, as soon as he espies a variant in the critical apparatus. An edition
prepared on R’s plan would be indeed not critical but hypercritical. Even
a constituted text is after all a text, meant to be read like any other text,
and not a chart of the aberrations of careless copyists of the last two 'millen-
nia. While it would be foolish to underline bhagndm (line 2) merely on the

1 Even with his reading, R.’s translation is inaccurate. The translation should
be : “ Aber kaum hatte der ubermachtige Garuda (den Baum) mit seinen Fiissen
beriihrtj als der Ast des Baumes abbrach”, etc. and not “ Nachdem (der Baum)
von Garu<Ja beruhrt war, bradi von ihm ein Ast,'" etc. R.’s' translation omits tu,
padbhydm and baliyasd and ignores the force of ""rmtra — (ifc.) ! — With R's reading
matte, the word sd in line 1 (for which there is no variant even in TGM^) re-
mains unclaimed and has to be forcibly connected with sdkhd in the middle of the
following line. Altogether the reading adopted by R. is unsatisfactory.



244


EPIC STUDIES


ground that three (inferior) MSS. read for it lagndm, which is obvi-
ously a clerical error, it is fatuous to underline text-words merely because
some MS. £281} or other has a divergent reading, as R. does in the case of
baRyasd (Ki mahdtmand), sa tad- (G^ sar^ib), tesdm evd"" (iSg te^dm
etc.

With regard to the short explanatory notes (p. 255 f.) added by R.
below the specimen of the text, I have to make the following comments.

The participle smayamdna is not “episch”, but smaym (of the text)
may be, since the root swi is commonly used with middle endings. — The line
340* being an interpolation (even R. admits, p. 256, the possibility of its
being that), the adhamukhdn of the text is opposed virtually only by the
Qvdhmukhdn of the two Grantha MSS. G 3 . g, because the remaining adverse
MSS, (Gj. 2 . 4 2 M), while trying to interpolate the Vaikhana^s (under the
influence of Suparn. 13.4), have obviously altered the last foot of the line
{2d) therefore the text reading adhomukhdn is hundred per cent, certain
and in need of no underlining, straight or wavy, — In view of the fact that
340* is missing even in T 0^,^ and in regard to the general character of
Gi. a. 4 . 5 explained above, there cannot be the slightest doubt about the spuri-
ousness of 340 * ; the line was probably first inserted in M and copied thence
by the highly inflated group Gi. 2 - 4 * 5 .— -The form jagjhe is found only in
five Devanagari and two Southern MSS. (one Malayalam arid one Grantha).
In old Devanagari MSS. (written with pr^tbamatras), jagfJte would be all
but indistinguishable from jagrdha of the text. So the reading of these Deva-
nagari MSS. may be ignored in this case. The Bangali and the Southern
MSS., which would carefully distinguish between the two words, have jag-
7dha, with two insignificant exceptions in the Southern recension. It is on
that account that jagrdha was adopted in the text, and it is not doubtful.—
2ef is certainly a third line, but is in spite of that quite certain. The line is
not missing in any MS., and as for its reading there is agreement on all
material points between all versions of both recensions. Thus K and S agree
completely with each other as far as e is concerned, which is a very signi-
ficant fact in its favour and should not be lightly ignored. The variations
concern mainly /. The difficult prmisdtayai, a led. diff., preserved only in
K, was the cause of the remodelling of the pada in S and the vulgate. Of
£282} course all guesses as to how the variants have actually arisen must be
more or less problematic. I would, however, hazard the conjecture that tlie
way to the variant pravicdlaym was virtually paved by the southern tend-
ency to confuse the palatal siWlant (5) and fricative (c) : the successive
steps in the corruption would be pravi^dtayan, corrupted to *°cdtayani and

then corrected ” to * °calaym. The vinasaym of Kg Dg is perhaps an ori-
ginal gloss ; or (more probably) a wrong correction of an original mislec-
tion, the successive steps being visatayan, *visdnayan {ta and na being writ-
ten almost alike in old Devanagari MSS), and vimsuym. The difficulty
with the word pmvisdtdyan may be realized when it is remembered that the
Dhatupatha knows no root like sat or sdt ; it cites only sad !

* * ♦

Ruben's long disquisition on the difficulties of the Mahabharata textual
criticism boils down to this : only that portion of the text which is docu-
mented by both recensions, in identical terms, is tolerably certain ; the rest
is doubtful in varying degrees, there being no criterion whatsoever which can
enable us to discriminate with complete confidence between the variants ;
even the concordance between K and S (against B D)i is not conclusive evi-
dence of the originality of the common reading. This is a more or less ob-
vious standpoint, though partly erroneous and distinctly timid and conser-
vative. It was hardly necessary for the “ Referent ” to write so much in order
to say so little. His attitude of dogmatic doubt has caused him to make
unwittingly some wild exaggerations and unwarranted generalizations as I
have shown above. His perfunctory study of the manuscript evidence has led
him occasionally to make gross blunders in the estimation of the relationship
of the different manuscript groups and versions, some of which have been
pointed out above. Many of the difficulties of the Mahabharata textual cri-
ticism of which he speaks in his paper are £283} due to his failure to under-
stand the modus opermdi of the redactors and copyists of the epic and his
lack of insight into the character of the different manuscripts--an insight
which can be acquired only after a long familiarity with the manuscripts
themselves and a close arid patient study of their tendencies and idiosyn-
cracies. Ruben's paper is, in general, quite intelligent, but not at all im-
portant for the Mahabharata textual criticism.
