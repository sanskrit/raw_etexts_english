Okay,this is going to be less a review and more of an outpouring of my
personal feelings on my reading that book.

This book by Stephen Bourne is a book that deals with a sample of the
materials available;gay men who served in the World Wars despite the
difficulties faced by them due to a society prejudiced against them. I
found the values of bravery,sacrifice,heroism and over all that,despite
official bigotry from time to time;even the most outrageously
camp/effeminate types were accomodated in roles as entertainers even if
not directly in fighting. And the ones who were in the frontlines;their
values of sacrifice,and the permanent relationships they could form(this
was relatively successful over time,surprisingly) despite how formally
society looked down upon them but unofficially tolerated them-because
they were men of virtue beyond just liking men-IMO are ideals to look
upto even after all these days and emaluate.
