## MIRACLES

(*Evening News*, February 17, 1894)

I cannot comply with the request of The News to work a miracle in proof
of my religion," said Vive Kananda to a representative of this paper,
after being shown The News editorial on the subject. "In the first
place, I am no miracle worker, and in the second place the pure Hindoo
religion I profess is not based on miracles. We do not recognize such a
thing as miracles. There are wonders wrought beyond our five senses, but
they are operated by some law. Our religion has nothing to do with them.
Most of the strange things which are done in India and reported in the
foreign papers are sleight-of-hand tricks or hypnotic illusions. They
are not the performances of the wise men. These do not go about the
country performing their wonders in the market places for pay. They can
be seen and known only by those who seek to know the truth, and not
moved by childish curiosity."
