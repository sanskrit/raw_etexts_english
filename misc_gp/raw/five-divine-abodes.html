<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">Preface</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We are happy to present this small educative booklet Five Divine Abodes (five abiding places of God) composed by Brahmalina Sri Jayadayal Goyandka. There are references of five different qualities—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) (Filial piety) of Mukachandala</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) (Femininechastity) of Shubha </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) (Brahmacharya) of Adrohaka </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4) (Truthfulness) of Tuladhara and </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(5) (Devotion of God) by Vaishnava. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These five qualities are real homes of God supreme and five great sacrifices—this is what has been highlighted by the author in this booklet. The episodes included in this booklet come from Padmapurana composed by Sri Veda Vyasa.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">It is indeed a worth reading book discussing five stairs of self-sublimation. We hope the readers would get benefited from it.<span></span></p>

<p class="Uwach">(Five Great Sacrifices)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">VyŒsaj¶ spoke—</span>Disciples, I will narrate to you episodes regarding five duties by practising anyone of them one can attain glory, heaven and even salvation. Adoring parents, serving husband, worshipping Lord Vi¦Äu, being equipoised to all and sundry and not estranging friends—are five MahŒyajÛas. First adoring parents then whatever Dharma one accomplishes, is impossible to earn even through hundreds of sacrifices and pilgrimages. Father is piety, father is paradise and father is verily the best penance. All gods are pleased if father is pleased. The son gets the virtue of bathing in the GaÆgŒ daily who propitiates his parents through his meritorious services and his virtues. Mother contains all holy places in her person and father is embodiment of all gods. Therefore, every care should be taken to propitiate parents. He makes circumambulation of the whole earth with seven continents who circumambulates his parents. He attains heaven whose hands, forehead and knees touch the earth while saluting them<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span>. The son remains sanctified till his body has the dust of his parent’s feet. The son who drinks the water with which, his parent’s feet are washed, gets destroyed his sins accumulated through crores of his past births. Blessed is such a person in the world. The wretch who disobeys his parents, remains in hell till the great deluge. One who deserts his father sick, old, deprived  of livelihood, blind and deaf, falls in Raurava—“<span class="char-style-override-8">रोगिणं चापि वृद्धं च पितरं वृत्तिकर्शितम्। विकलं नेत्रकर्णाभ्यां त्यक्त्वा गच्छेच्च रौरवम्॥’’ (प०पु०, सृ०ख०</span> 47.19). Not  only this but he has to be born as Antyaja, Mleccha and CŒÄÎŒla. All virtues perish by neglecting parents. Not adoring parents even if one visits holy places and worships gods, it is all fruitless.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">BrŒhmaÄas! I am going to narrate an ancient episode. Harken to it. By hearing it you will no more be deluded in the world. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It happened in the time of yore. There was a BrŒhmaÄa named Narottama. He went on pilgrimage deserting his parents. While visiting T¶rthas, his clothes dried in the sky. This generated in him a great pride. He thought that there was no other virtuous and glorious person equal to him. One day he was telling this while looking at the sky. Some crane passed excretum on his face. The BrŒhmaÄa got angry and hurled a curse. The crane burnt to ashes and fell on the ground. As soon as the crane died, the BrŒhmaÄa became a prey to delusion. His clothes ceased to stay in the sky due to the same sin.  He became very sad to know it. Then an invisible voice was heard—“BrŒhmaÄa! Go to the virtuous Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla. There you will get the knowledge of Dharma. His teachings will be benedictory for you.”<span class="char-style-override-9"></span></p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-1" xml:lang="en-US">Filial piety</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After hearing this the BrŒhmaÄa went to the residence of the CŒÄÎŒla. There he saw him serving his parents with heart and soul. During winter he served them hot water for bath, gave oil massage, kindled oven to warm them, offered betel after food and donned them with cottonlined dress. Daily he served delicious sweets and fragrant garland in spring season. He provided all other varieties of enjoyments and fulfilled all their needs. He daily fanned them in summer. In this way he daily nursed them and only after serving them he used to take food. It was his permanent routine to remove the fatigue and other inconveniences of his parents. Due to these virtuous deeds his house was hung in the sky without any base or support of pillars. Ýr¶ Hari, the Lord of all the three worlds used to sport daily in his house in the guise of a handsome BrŒhmaÄa. The Lord as truth incarnate, beautified his abode with His effulgent presence. Seeing all this, BrŒhmaÄa was greatly amazed. He said to the Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla—“Come on. I will ask you some questions for universal and eternal benevolence. Tell me aright.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla said—</span><span>“</span><span>O BrŒhmaÄa, I am now busy in serving my parents. How can I come to you? After being free from their worship, I shall do your job. I will offer you hospitality. Please, wait at my door.”</span><span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing CŒÄÎŒla say so the BrŒhmaÄa got infuriated and said—“What else can be more important to you apart from attending upon a BrŒhmaÄa like me?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">CŒÄÎŒl</span><span class="char-style-override-6">a</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> Said—</span>“Why do you unnecessarily lose temper? I am not the crane. Your anger can be effective only on a crane but not on anybody else. Now your garments neither dry in the sky nor they stay there. So obeying the oracle you have come to my house. If you wait a little I will give suitable reply to your query or else you may go to the chaste lady. Having her vision you will have your mission achieved.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">VyŒsaj¶ says—</span>After that the Lord Vi¦Äu in the form of the BrŒhmaÄa, came out from the residence of CŒÄÎŒla and said to the BrŒhmaÄa—“Let me accompany you to the residence of the chaste woman.” After a little thought Narottama accompanied him. He was quite amazed. He enquired of the Lord  on his  way—“O BrŒhmaÄa, what for do you live here in the house of this CŒÄÎŒla where women also live?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord (in the form of BrŒhmaÄa) said—<br/></span>“O BrŒhmaÄa, at present your heart is not pure. First have DarÜana of the chaste lady. Only then you will be able to know me.”</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-2" xml:lang="en-US">Feminine chastity</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa asked—</span>“Who is this chaste woman sir? How vast is her scriptural knowledge that I am going to her ? Please, tell me the reality of it.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord said—</span>“O BrŒhmaÄa, the GaÆgŒ among rivers; a chaste lady among women and Lord Vi¦Äu among gods are superiormost. A chaste woman engaged always in doing good to her husband, liberates one hundred generations of both—in the lineage of her husband as well as of her father.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa—</span>“Which woman is chaste and what are the characteristic marks of a chaste woman? Kindly teach me in such a way so that I may thoroughly understand it.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord—</span>“A chaste woman is she, who renders adoration to her husband with hundred times more love than what she has for her son; fears him like a king and treats him like God embodied. Who acts like a maid while attending to domestic chores; like a prostitute at the time of cohabitation, like a mother at the time of feeding and like a minister at the time of crisis by giving good advice. A woman may be taken as PativratŒ who never disobeys her husband either mentally, verbally, bodily or through even gestures and takes food only after feeding her husband. Such a lady is PativratŒ who adores her husband on whatever beds he sleeps; who never nurtures any sense of jealousy for him; nor does she ever behave miserly nor is ever displeased irrespective of how her husband treats her—respectfully or otherwise; who treats both honour or dishonour as equal. The chaste lady who considers any other man how so ever handsome—as her brother, father or son, is PativratŒ. O best among BrŒhmaÄas, go to that PativratŒ and tell her what you want. Her name is ÝubhŒ. She is a young beauty and full of compassion. She is well named. Go and ask her what is good for you.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">VyŒsaj¶ says—</span>After saying so the Lord disappeared there and the BrŒhmaÄa was thunder struck to see the Lord disappeared. He went to her house and enquired about her. She heard him calling and came out and stood at the door. BrŒhmaÄa saw her and happily asked her—“Devi, please tell me about my well being as you know and have understood.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">PativratŒ—</span>O BrŒhmaÄa, at present I have to serve my husband and so I have no time now. Thus I will attend to you later. Now please accept my hospitality.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa—</span>“O auspicious lad<span>y</span>! I do not feel any hunger, thirst or fatigue. So tell me at once what you have to tell or else I will curse you.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">PativratŒ—</span>“I am not the crane, O great BrŒhmaÄa ! You better go to Dharma TulŒdhŒra and ask him about your own good.” Having said so the exalted lady retreated into the house. Then the BrŒhmaÄa again saw the Lord in the guise of a BrŒhmaÄa just as he saw Him in the house of the CŒÄÎŒla. He was amazed to see Him. He  thought a little and then approached Him. When he entered the house, he saw there both—the BrŒhmaÄa as well as PativratŒ. Narottama asked Him—Sir, how did this chaste lady come to know what took place somewhere else? The CŒÄÎŒla also did say the same. How do these people know that incident? I am at my wit’s end. What else can be more surprising than thi<span>s</span>?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord—</span>“Sir, the great souled, on the strength of their supremely virtuous deeds and pious conduct, happen to know the cause of everything which has baffled you. Tell Me what the chaste lady said to you.”</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-3" xml:lang="en-US">Truthfulness</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa—</span>“She advises me to go to Dharma TulŒdhŒra.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord—</span>O great Muni, come on. I will also go there to  him. “Having so said, when the Lord started, the BrŒhmaÄa asked— “Where does TulŒdhŒra live?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord—</span>“Look, where there is a great crowd of men and sale and purchase in various articles is going on; there moves TulŒdhŒra around and makes business transactions. He never did any harm to anyone through his mind, speech or body; never told a lie or behaved crookedly. He is always engaged in doing good to others. He maintains equanimity among all creatures and treats equally a clod of earth, a stone and a lump of gold. Customers too, relying on his words and take and give commodities like barley, salt, oil, ghee, bags of grains and other stored articles. He will never tell a lie even at the risk of his life. So he is called Dharma TulŒdhŒra.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord pointed at him and the BrŒhmaÄa saw him selling different articles. He was talking about mercantile commodities. He was surrounded by many persons—men and women. Seeing the BrŒhmaÄa, he asked with sweet words—how do you happen to come here?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa—</span>“Please teach me Dharma. I have come for the same.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">TulŒdhŒra—</span>“I cannot be free till people are there with me. The rush will continue till the first watch of the night. Do as I say and go to DharmŒkara. The sin accruing from the death of the crane and the secret behind the Dhot¶ drying in the sky—everything you will come to know. The name of DharmŒkara is Adrohaka. He is a thorough gentleman. Go to him. You will have your wishes fulfilled.”</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-4" xml:lang="en-US">Brahmacharya</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Saying so TulŒdhŒra again carried on sale and purchase. Narottama said to the Lord  in the form of the BrŒhmaÄa— “Now as instructed by TulŒdhŒra, I will go to Adrohaka but I do not know the location of his residence<span>.</span>” The Lord offered Himself to be his guide.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While on their way Narottama asked the Lord—“Sir, TulŒdhŒra offers no libations to gods or ¤R¦is nor to the manes. How did he know what happened with me insome other place? I am astonished. Kindly tell me the reason.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord</span><span class="char-style-override-6">—</span>O BrŒhmaÄa, He has conquered the three worlds with his truthfulness and equanimity. So the manes, gods and ¤R¦is are all pleased with him. The righteous TulŒdhŒra knows everything of past or future. There is no virtue greater than truth nor a sin greater than untruth. One, who is sinless and equipoised; who looks at enemy, friend and neutral person with the same eye, gets one’s sins destroyed and attains SŒyujya of Lord Vi¦Äu. Equanimity is the best Dharma and highest penance. One, whose mind is always established in equanimity, is the best in all the three worlds, worthy of being counted as the best among Yog¶s and unaffected by greed. One who acts always equanimously, liberates many generations in his lineage. In him there are qualities like truthfulness, restraint over senses and mind, forbearance, steadfastness, greedlessness and absence of laziness. It is through the glory of equanimity that the righteous man knows all happenings of heaven and this  world alike. Lord Vi¦Äu always abides inside his body. There is nobody equal to him in the traits like truthfulness and simplicity etc. He is the very Dharma in person and it is he who holds the world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa—</span>“Sir, by your grace now I know why TulŒdhŒra could become all-knowing. Now tell me about Adrohaka.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord—</span>“It happened in the remote past. A prince had an exceptionally beautiful and young wife from a high family. She was as charming as Rati, the consort of Cupid or like Ýac¶, the spouse of Indra. The prince loved her more even than his own life. That beauteous lady had her name also as Sundar¶ (the beautiful). One day the prince had to go out of capital on some state business. He became thoughtful about where to keep his wife, who was dearer  to him even than his life, so that her chastity could be preserved with surety. After considering carefully the prince came to the house of Adrohaka and put before him the problem of his wife’s security and proposed that Adrohaka should take the responsibility. Adrohaka was amazed to hear the proposal and said—“Dear sir, I am nobody to you—neither your father nor brother nor from your lineage. Also I do not have any relation with the parental family of your wife nor am I one from among your friends. How can you be carefree by keeping her in my house?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Prince—</span>“O MahŒtmŒ, at present there is no other person in the world as pious and subduer of senses as you are.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having heard so, Adrohaka said—“Won’t blame  me sir. Who can be able to protect this young lady who could charm all the three sphere<span>s</span><span>?</span>”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Prince—</span>“I have come here only after considering from every angle. Let her remain here. Now I go.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After prince said so, he again spoke—“Dear sir, this beautiful town is full with libidinous persons. How can the chastity of a lady be safe?” The prince again said—“I go. It is now up to you to protect her in anyway you think fit.” Adrohaka, a householder, finding himself in a dilemma, pleaded—“Very well sir, (but one thing you must know very clearly) I shall always ill-treat her as I will deem proper  and good. Only that way such a lady can be safe in my house or else you yourself better suggest some way. She will have to co-share my bed along with my wife. Even then if you think you will love her as usual, let her stay here or else there is no room for her.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The prince heard it, thought for a moment and said— “Agreed sir. You can do anything that you think fit and proper.” And  he said to his wife—“Sundar¶, you will do what he asks. You will not be blamed. You have got my consent for that.” The prince left and went to the place as commanded by the king, his father.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When night fell, Adrohaka did exactly what he had said. He daily slept in between the two ladies—(his wife on one side and Sundar¶ on the other). But he never slipped from Dharma in regard of his own wife and that of somebody else. He felt sexual urge only when he touched his own wife. But if and when the breasts of the princess touched his back, he had the same feeling which an infant has when it touches the breasts of its mother. He had always a motherly sentiment towards her. Gradually the sexual instinct disappeared from him. Six months passed when the prince returned to the town where Adrohaka lived. He enquired of the people about the conduct of his wife and Adrohaka. They answered as they had feelings of their own. Some of them praised the arrangement made by the prince, some expressed their amazement while others said—“You deposited your wife with him. He sleeps with her. When a man and a woman come in close contact how can their passions be calm?” Adrohaka knew every bit of ill gossip about him on account of his spiritual power and he came to a righteous decision. In order to free himself from the social stigma he himself collected wood and built a big pyre and kindled it. The pyre was inflamed. At the nick of the time the splendrous prince reached the abode of Adrohaka. He saw there Adrohaka and his wife, both. The face of his wife was bloomingly cheerful and Adrohaka appeared gloomy. He took notice of their mental condition and addressed thus—“Dear brother, I am your friend coming back after a long time. Why don’t you talk to me?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Adrohaka—</span>“I have done a wrong thing in your own interest. What I did, is all spoiled due to public scandal. Now I will enter into the fire. Let all gods as well as men witness this act of mine.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord narrates—</span>Saying so magnanimous Adrohaka entered into the fire but the fire could not burn his body, clothes or even his hairs. The gods from the sky cheered and praised him. Everyone showered flowers on his head from all sides. On the other hand, people who calumniated and defamed Adrohaka and the princess, developed leprosy on their faces. The gods appeared there, pulled Adrohaka out of the fire and cheerfully adored him with various flowers of divine origin. The Munis also were astonished to hear of their conduct. All Munis along with the present gentry worshipped that greatly splendrous MahŒtmŒ and he also on his own turn entertained them. On that occasion gods, Asuras and men unanimously named him as SajjanŒdrohaka. The land sanctified by the dust of his feet started giving more yield of the crops. The gods advised the prince to have his wife. They said—“There has been no other person like Adrohaka in the world. At present there is nobody on this earth who has not been overpowered by lust and greed. The sex instinct is unconquerable by all gods, Asuras, humans, RŒk¦asas, beasts, birds and insects. It is due to the lustfulness, greed and anger that beings have got to take birth again and again. Lust alone is the cause of bondage. It is difficult to get a person devoid of sexual desire anywhere in the world. Adrohaka has conquered all, recorded a victory over all the fourteen spheres. In his heart there always lives Lord VŒsudeva cheerfully. By having his vision men are freed from all sins and get inexhaustible heaven.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After saying so gods went to heaven in their VimŒnas quite happily. The gathering of men also dispersed and the prince with his wife went to his palace. Since then Adrohaka acquired Divya D¾¦¢i (a divine power to see everything). He could see even gods and know easily any happening in all the three worlds.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">VyŒsaj¶ says—</span>After that the BrŒhmaÄa went to the street where Adrohaka lived, had his DarÜana and asked him the Dharma and what was good for his own self.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">SajjanŒdrohaka—</span>“O religious BrŒhmaÄa, you now go to the Vai¦Äava, the best among all men. You will get your desire fulfilled by having his vision. You will come to know the reason behind the death of the crane and why your clothes ceased to stay and dry there in the sky. Besides this all your desires will be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-5" xml:lang="en-US">Vi¦Äubhakti</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then along with the Lord in the guise of BrŒhmaÄa, went to the abode of the Vai¦Äava. There he saw a pure hearted effulgent person sitting in front of the house. He wore all auspicious marks glowing with effulgence. The religious BrŒhmaÄa said to the devotee of Hari—<br/>“O great souled one, I have come to you from a very far off place. Please, instruct me what is proper for me.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Vai¦Äava said—</span>“Lord Vi¦Äu, the best among gods, is pleased with you. My heart is brimming with favourable emotions to see you. So you will attain supreme good. Today your desires will come true. Lord Vi¦Äu lives in my house. The BrŒhmaÄa again said to the Vai¦Äava—“Where is the Lord ? Please, let me also have His vision.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Vai¦Äava—</span>“Enter this temple and have the vision of the Lord. By doing so you will get rid of the sin that causes the bondage of birth and death.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having heard him say so, the BrŒhmaÄa entered the temple and saw that it is the same Lord in the form of BrŒhmaÄa sitting on the lotus flower. The BrŒhmaÄa bowed his head  and offered PraÄŒma to Him. He happily caught His feet and said—“O Lord of lords, be propitiated, I could not cognise You before. O Lord, let me remain Your slave in this world and the other world also. O slayer of  Madhu, I have realised today Your grace on me. If You are pleased, let me have Your direct vision.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord—</span>“O BrŒhmaÄa, I always have affection for you. It is out of love that I caused you to meet with so many virtuous persons. By having DarÜana of exalted souls or their touch or remembrance or through uttering their names and talking with them, a person enjoys inexhaustible heavenly pleasures. By keeping  company of great persons all sins are wiped out and the person enjoys inexhaustible pleasure and finally merges in Brahma. The person who takes bath in holy places and has vision of Lord Ýiva and visits the hermitages of virtuous persons, also merges in My body. One who observes fast on EkŒdaÜ¶, which is My day, narrates My KathŒ before a gathering, also merges with Me. One who, hearing My pastime keeps awake in the night, also merges in My body. O BrŒhmaÄa ! One who remembers My names loudly singing and playing on musical instruments, also merges in My body. One who never opposes even mentally ascetics, king, and elderly people, also merges in My form. You are <span class="char-style-override-10">m</span>y devotee and a holy <span>T</span>¶rtha yourself but since you cursed the crane to its death, so in order to get you rid of that sin, it was I <span class="char-style-override-10">w</span>ho suggested to you to have a visit of holy places and to go to Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla. Dear sir, you yourself saw how he adored his parents. As a result of the vision of those great persons and talking to them and associating with <span class="char-style-override-10">m</span>e, you have come today to <span class="char-style-override-10">m</span>y temple. After crores of births when a person gets his sins perished, he has a chance for <span class="char-style-override-10">m</span>y vision, which makes him supremely happy. My child, by My grace alone you have got My vision.Therefore, you may ask for any boon you desire.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa said—</span>“My Lord, let my mind be always engrossed in Your thoughts. MŒdhava, Lord of all the worlds, let there appear nothing to me as dear as You.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord—</span>“O sinless BrŒhmaÄa, you always have such noble thoughts in your mind. So you will finally come to My abode and enjoy divine  pleasures like Me. But your parents are not getting due respect from you. So first go and serve your mother and father. After that you will attain My form. Your penances are diminishing day by day due to their sorrowful sighs and anger. Even Myself, BrahmŒ or MahŒdeva cannot keep a person from going to hell who is looked upon angrily by his parents. Therefore, go to your parents and nurse them with every possible care. After that by their grace you will attain to My abode.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">VyŒsaj¶ narrates—</span>After the Lord of the universe said so, the BrŒhmaÄa Narottama so spoke—“My Lord, if you are pleased with me, kindly grant me the vision of Your real form.” Then  the only creator of the entire world, the benefactor of BrŒhmaÄas, manifested in His four-armed form with conch, discus, mace and lotus and showed him in His Puru¦ottama form, pleased as He was due to the love of Narottama. The entire world was flooded with His effulgence. The BrŒhmaÄa prostrated himself on the ground, bade his PraÄŒma and said— “O Lord of the universe! Today my birth is blessed. My eyes got benediction. The purpose of my having two hands is accomplished today. I am also blessed today. My ancestors are going to eternal Brahmaloka. O JanŒrdana, today my people are rejoicing. Now all my desires are materialized. But Lord, I am still amazed to think of the great souls such as Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla and others and how they knew what took  place with me in a far off place. You were there in the house of Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla in the most charming form of a BrŒhmaÄa. In the same way I saw you in the houses of the chaste lady, TulŒdhŒra, MitrŒdrohaka and I see you here in the residence of  this Vai¦Äava; what is the secret behind these. Please, oblige me by telling it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord said—</span>“O best among BrŒhmaÄas, Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla has devotion for his parents. ÝubhŒ is PativratŒ, TulŒdhŒra always speaks truth and is equipoised to all. Adrohaka has conquered lust and covetousness and this Vai¦Äava is single minded devotee of Mine. Pleased for these virtues I most happily live in  their houses. Lak¦m¶  and Saraswat¶ also live in their abodes along with Me. Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla is benefactor of all the three spheres. Even though a CŒÄÎŒla, his conduct is always ideal. So gods regard him as BrŒhmaÄa. On account of his virtuous deeds there is nobody in the world equal to him. He is always busy with devotion of his parent. On account of his filial devotion he has conquered all the three worlds. I am pleased with his filial piety and live in his house in the guise of BrŒhmaÄa along with all heavenly deities. Similarly I always abide in the houses of that PativratŒ, TulŒdhŒra, Adrohaka and this Vai¦Äava. O knower of Dharma, I do not leave their houses even for a moment. It is only virtuous persons and not the sinners who have my DarÜana. You could see <span class="char-style-override-10">m</span>e on account of your virtues and by My grace. Now I will narrate their virtuous conduct one by one and you should harken to it attentively. By hearing such description one is released forever from the bondage of birth and death. There is no <span>T</span>¶rtha holier than the parents. One who adores them, is the best among men. He abides in My heart and I abide in his. There remains no difference between us. He deserves adoration here and hereafter just like Me. Such a person along with all his kinsmen reaches My supreme abode and merges within Me. It is only because of his filial service and worship that he happens to know what takes place in the three worlds. Why are you so surprised ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa asked—</span>“O Lord of the world, if a man shirks from his parental servings in the beginning due to his infatuation and ignorance and afterwards, when he realises what is good or evil and wishes to serve his parents, in such case what should he do?<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Miscellaneous Preachings</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord said—</span>“One who has served devotedly his parent for a year, a month, a fortnight, a week or even a day, attains My abode and one offending them surely goes to the hell, it is certain. One who releases a bull  after the death of parents (on the eleventh day) gets the fruit of filial devotion irrespective of the fact whether he nursed them during their lifetime or not. The wise who does the ÝrŒddha of parents even spending every bit of his possession, develops memory of his past births and gets full result of parental devotion. There is no YajÛa greater than the ÝrŒddha in all the three worlds. The charity given in ÝrŒddha becomes inexhaustible. The donation given to others produces ten thousand times more result from the charity given to the people of one’s own caste, one lac times used in the PiÄÎadŒna, one crore times and given to BrŒhmaÄas infinite times more fruit is obtained. One who donates food grains in the waters of the GaÆgŒ or at GayŒ, PrayŒga, Pu¦kara, KŒÜ¶, SiddhakuÄÎa and GaÆgŒsŒgara, his manes attain inexhaustible heavenly pleasure and he himself is sure to get liberation. His life is blessed. He who particularly offers TarpaÄa (libation of water) mixed with seasamum seeds, also finds the path to salvation, then what to talk of him who offers PiÄÎa? He who performs PŒrvaÄa ÝrŒddha on Parva days, on the day when Yuga starts from, on the days of solar or lunar eclipse, gets his title for inexhaustible worlds. His manes give him desired blessings and are satiated for ten thousand years. So on every Parva (special type of astronomical junctures having religious significance) one should perform PŒrvaÄa ÝrŒddha. By doing this ÝrŒddha YajÛa for parents one is freed from all bondages.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The ÝrŒddha done daily is  known as Nitya ÝrŒddha. One who performs Nitya ÝrŒddha with faith, enjoys inexhaustible worlds. Similarly by doing KŒmya ÝrŒddha (desiring some specific result) in dark fortnight one gets his desired object. During fifth fortnight after  ÝrŒddha PµurÄimŒ which is known as MahŒlaya or Pit¾pak¦a (fortnight of manes) the ÝrŒddha for manes should be done. Whether the sun is in virgo or not should not be a point of consideration. When the sun enters virgo, since then sixteen days’ period is best for KŒmya ÝrŒddha. In this period the ÝrŒddha gives result of YajÛas in which plenty of sacrificial fee is paid. During this period such sacred ÝrŒddha should be performed. It does good to the performer. If somehow the ÝrŒddha could not be performed at proper time, it should be made in dark fortnight while the sun is in TulŒ.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the time of lunar eclipse every charity given is like land donation, every BrŒhmaÄa becomes VyŒsa and water of every place becomes like GaÆgŒ water. The donation given in lunar eclipse is one lac times more fruitful than that given at any other time. At the time of solar eclipse it gives result ten lac times more. If GaÆgŒjala is available then donations given in lunar and solar eclipses are one crore and ten crore times more fruitful respectively. What virtue is gained by donating one lac cows in appropriate manner, is obtained by bathing in the GaÆgŒ at the time of lunar eclipse. One who has a dip in the GaÆgŒ at the time of lunar or solar eclipse, obtains virtue of bathing in all T¶rthas. If solar eclipse happens to be on Sunday and lunar eclipse on Monday, it is known as CµuÎŒmaÄi Yoga. The virtue obtained from bathing and giving donation, is infinite. At that time if a person keeps fast and then offers PiÄÎa to the manes, makes TarpaÄa and donates wealth, he gets his place in the Satyaloka.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa asked—</span>“Lord, you described the MahŒyajÛa as ÝrŒddha for manes. Now tell me what a son should do for his father while he is alive. Doing what can a son attain supreme good during so many births to come?” Please tell me all this carefully.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord said—</span>“O BrŒhmaÄa, father should be adored like <span class="char-style-override-10">g</span>od and loved like a son. An idea of disobeying should not arise even in the mind. The son who nurses his sick father, gets inexhaustible heaven and is adorable by gods in the heaven. When the father is waiting for death and there appear visible marks of approaching death, even at that time by worshipping father, the son acquires a godly status. Now I am going to tell you what good occurs by keeping fast in a proper way for father’s supreme benefit. Harken to it. Fast observed for the good of the parents, yields virtue that can be had from performing one thousand AÜvamedha and one hundred RŒjasµuya YajÛas. If the fast is observed in a holy place, it gives crore times more fruit than the two YajÛas can. The great man who dies in the waters of the GaÆgŒ, does not suckle the mother’s breasts again but gets liberated. One who intentionally gives up his life in KŒÜ¶, enjoys his desired objects and becomes one with Me. What position a Yog¶, BrahmacŒr¶ and Muni attains, the same is attained by him who leaves his body in the seven forks of the Brahmaputra. One who dies in the prescribed manner on the bank—particularly north bank of the Sona river, he becomes equal to Me. If a person dies inside a house, he gets bound at as many places on his body as there are knots in the thatch. After the completion of each year one knot is open. The son, the kinsmen all simply stand and watch helplessly. Nobody can free him from that bondage. He who dies on a mountain, in a forest, on inaccessible places or in a waterless place go downward. He has to take birth as insect or worm. The person whose body is cremated on the second day after death, has to live in Kumbh¶pŒka for sixty thousand years. He who dies after  touching an untouchable or in a fallen (demoralised) condition, remains in the hell for a long time and then takes birth in Mleccha community. Either due to accumulated virtues or by performing virtuous deeds in the  present life, as a mortal man thinks at the time of death so he becomes in his next life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the death of his father, the stout son while carrying the dead body of his father on his shoulders, obtains the fruit of AÜvamedha at every step. First the son should lay the dead body of his father and then while reciting Mantra, should set his mouth on fire and then burnt he whole body. He should say, “I am burning the body of my father which was contaminated with greed and infatuation. Let him go to the divine sphere.” After burning the body this way he should wait for a few days and collect the remaining bones and ashes. On the tenth day after bath he should discard the wet clothes. On the eleventh day he should perform ÝrŒddha and feed a BrŒhmaÄa for the nourishment of the body of the dead soul. He should donate clothes, wooden plank (to sit) and wooden sandles in a prescribed manner. In all sixteen ÝrŒddhas in a year—apart from one in each month, the fourth day after DaÜŒha, after one and a half months, one before six months (generally five and a half months) and one before the year is completed, are prescribed. One for whom these sixteen ÝrŒddhas are not performed, becomes a ghost forever. And then even after hundreds of ÝrŒddhas he is not liberated from Pretahood. After one year is completed, a learned person should do SapiÄÎ¶karaÄa ÝrŒddha on the lines of PŒrvaÄa ÝrŒddha.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The BrŒhmaÄa asked—</span>“If an ascetic, a forest dweller and a household BrŒhmaÄa—is poor, how can he make Pit¾ ÝrŒddha?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord said—</span>“One who does ÝrŒddha by collecting grass or wood <span>(</span>and selling it) or by begging small amount, the virtuous result of it multiplies by one lac times more. If a person has nothing and he simply gives some grass to a cow to eat, he obtains virtue more than PiÄÎadŒna. It was in the hoary past, there lived a very poor man in VirŒ¢a country. One day when the ÝrŒddha was due, he had absolutely nothing with him and he began to weep bitterly. After weeping for long he consulted a learned BrŒhmaÄa—“Sir, today it is ÝrŒddha day of my father and I do not have even a farthing with me. In this condition what will be beneficial for me? Kindly show me the way so that my Dharma may not get jeopardised.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The learned BrŒhmaÄa replied—</span>“Now it is ‘Kutapa Muhµurta’ and it is just about to pass. Be quick. Go to the  forest. Get some grass and feed a cow with it.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">He did accordingly, went to the forest, brought a bundle of  grass and fed it to a cow most gladly for the satisfaction of his father. On account of this virtuous feat he went to heaven. There is no Dharma greater than Pit¾yajÛa. Therefore one must do ÝrŒddha with all possible care and without any ill feeling. One who recites this chapter captioned as ‘Dharma-SantŒna’, gets virtue of bathing in the GaÆgŒ in every Loka. The entire stock of even great sins accumulated during birth after birth, gets destroyed by a single recitation of this chapter or even hearing it once.<span class="char-style-override-5"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">The PativratŒ’s Episode </p>
<p class="Uwach">Dialogue between UmŒ and NŒrada in respect of flirt women, the Glory of PativratŒ, the Virtue of KanyŒdŒna</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Narottama enquired—</span>“Lord, how does the chaste woman know the happenings of my past? What is her glory? Be kind to tell me all this.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord said—</span>“My child, I have already told you all that, yet if you want to hear again, I will tell you what questions are haunting your mind. A PativratŒ who loves her husband like her life and is always engaged to serve the interest of her husband, she becomes an object of worship even to the gods and Munis devoted to Vedas. The lady who serves only one man and does not casteven anyone else, is worth adoring in the world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Long long ago, there was a very beautiful town in Madhya DeÜa (middle region). Therein lived a PativratŒ BrŒhmaÄa lady named  ÝaibyŒ. Her husband, due to his past sins, suffered from leprosy. He had a number of wounds on his body which discharged pus always. ÝaibyŒ was always engaged in serving him. She as per her capacity, always fulfilled his desires. Everyday she served her husband as if he was God and loved him. One day her husband saw an exceptionally beautiful prostitute passing through the road. He got infatuated as soon as he saw her. The cupid overpowered him. He breathed heavily and became sad eventually. The PativratŒ saw him sighing and  came out of the house. She enquired—“My Lord, why have you become sad? Why do you have heavy breaths? Tell me what you want. I will certainly do it whether it is worth doing or not. You alone are Guru and dearest to me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, addressed by the wife he said—“Darling, it is beyond your power to do. I also cannot do it. So there  is no sense in talking about it.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">PativratŒ spoke—</span>“My Lord, I am sure, I may be able to accomplish your object, just tell me. I have got to fulfil your desire through any means whatsoever. If I could do it, even though difficult, I will be blessed in this world and the other world too.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The leper said—</span>“O pious one, just now a most charming prostitute has passed through this way. Her body was simply enchanting in all respects. After seeing her my heart is burning with the fire of sexual urge. If by your grace I could get that young beauty, my life will be blessed. Kindly get her for me and thus fulfil my desire.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">After hearing her husband the PativratŒ said—</span>“Lord, have patience for the time being. I will do it to the best of my capacity.” PativratŒ had some thinking and in last hours of night she got up, took a broom and cow dung with her and started for the residence of the prostitute. She was cheerful. She reached there. She swept the street and her courtyard and plastered with cow dung and went back soon lest the people might see her. This way she did sweeping and plastering in the house of the prostitute for three consecutive days. The prostitute enquired of her servants if any of them had done the cleaning. They consulted each other and said that they had not done the job. The harlot was very much amazed. She kept on thinking for some time.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Next morning she woke up early and saw the PativratŒ who had again come there to render service. The harlot fell at her feet and said—“Oh, what are you doing? Now stop. Oh, this act of yours will destroy my longevity, body, wealth and fame. I promise, I shall give you whatever you wish—gold, gems, garment and anything else—just speak. I shall give it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Then PativratŒ said—</span>“I don’t want money. I want your personal obligation. If you promise to do it, I will tell you. I will feel satisfied and my wishes fulfilled if you comply with what I may request.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The harlot said—</span>“Speak, I truly promise to do whatever you ask. O motherly one, please tell your requirement and save me.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The PativratŒ though bashfully told her what was object of her husband. The harlot pondered over what she could do and what a torture the BrŒhmaÄa might be undergoing. She shuddered with the idea of cohabiting with a stinking leper. But she said to PativratŒ—Devi, if your husband comes to my place, then I will entertain him once and get his wishes fulfilled.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">PativratŒ said—</span>“O beautiful lady, tonight I will bring him to your residence and again take him back when he has fulfilled his desire.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The harlot said—</span>“O fortunate one, now go back to your abode. Let your husband come to my mansion today in the midnight.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing this the PativratŒ went back to her house and reported to her husband—“Lord, your mission has been achieved. You are to go to her house today itself during night.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The leper said—</span>“How can I go there Devi? I am unable even to move. Then how can it be done?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">PativratŒ said—</span>“Lord, I will take you there on my back and bring you back the same way after you get your mission achieved.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa said—</span>“O auspicious lady, only you could do this. It is not possible for other women to do what you have done.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord says—</span>In that town thieves had stolen a big amount from the house of a rich man. When it came to the knowledge of the king, he summoned all the police-men who were on patrolling duty in the night and said—“Get the thieves before me if you have a desire to live.” The command frightened them and they set out with a desire to arrest the culprit. Near that town there was a dense forest. There under a tree sat the greatly splendrous Muni MŒÄÎavya in a deep trance. He the leading among the Yog¶s, was effulgent like fire. Seeing that splendrous Muni who appeared like another BrahmŒ, the crooked policemen came to decide that the Muni was the thief. This cunning fellow lives here in this forest in disguise. Saying so those sinners roped MŒÄÎavya. But MŒÄÎavya neither spoke to those terrible men nor did he cast even a look at them. When the police took him to the king, the king said to them—“I have got the thief today. Take him on the road leading to the main gate of the town and punish in the way prescribed for a thief.” They took MŒÄÎavya there and seated him on the Ýµula (a sharply pointed pole) which went through his anus and reached the skull. His entire body was pierced on account of the Ýµula. In the meantime when the midnight was pitch dark and sky was thick with clouds, the PativratŒ was going to the house of the harlot with her husband on her back. She passed by the side of Muni and the body of the leper touched him. With the contact of the leper his trance was broken. He was enraged and said—“Let him, who caused me to feel this writhing pain, burnt to ashes as soon as the Sun rises.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">No sooner did MŒÄÎavya say so than the leper fell on the ground. Then the PativratŒ said—“Let there be no sunrise from today onward.” She took her husband home, laid him on a soft bed and sat there holding him. On the other side, MŒÄÎavya—the best among sages, went to his desired place after cursing him. This way three days passed and the Sun did not rise. All the three spheres along with the creatures—mobile and immobile—were distressed. Seeing this all gods headed by Indra approached BrahmŒ and reporting about the Sun not rising, enquired about the cause. They requested him to do needful. BrahmŒj¶ heard it and then narrated what happened in regard of Muni MŒÄÎavya and PativratŒ. After that gods in their chariots, led by BrahmŒ, went near the house of the leper. Due to the brightness of chariots and effulgence of Munis (it appeared as i<span>f</span>) crores of suns were risen. The PativratŒ saw those gods coming by chariots shaped like goose. She lay by the side of her husband. BrahmŒ addressed her and said—“O mother, How did you like such a thing in which the death of all gods, BrŒhmaÄas, cows and other beings may be involved. Give up your anger against sunrise.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The PativratŒ said—</span>“O Lord, My husband alone is my Guru. He is more valuable to me than the  entire world. Due to the curse of Muni, my husband will die just when the Sun rises. This is why I cursed the Sun. I have not done it under the sway of anger, greed, jealousy or lust. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrahmŒ said—</span>“Mother, for the good of all the three worlds, if one person (your husband) dies, it will be an act of virtue on your part.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The PativratŒ said—</span>“At the cost of my husband I will not like even the most auspicious Satyaloka of yours.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrahmŒ said—</span>“O good lady, when the three spheres get normalcy after sunrise in the morning then I will do supreme good to you. Even if your husband will be a heap of ashes yet I will enliven him again and this leper will be transformed into a man as handsome as the god of love.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That Sat¶ thought for a moment and then consented. The sun rose immediately and along with that the accursed BrŒhmaÄa became just a heap of ashes, and out of that heap came out that BrŒhmaÄa in as lovely a form as KŒmadeva himself. All inhabitants of the town were amazed to see this. All the gods were happy and everybody got recomposed. At that time an effulgent chariot came from heaven and the Sat¶ with her husband sat in it and went to heaven with the gods.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“ÝubhŒ also is a PativratŒ of the same stature and so she is just like Me. On account of her Sat¶hood she knows everything of past, present and future. The person who recites this episode in the people, will get free from all sins of several births.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The BrŒhmaÄa asked—</span>“O Lord, why was MŒÄÎavya inflicted injury with the Ýµula and why did the BrŒhmaÄa suffer from leprosy?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord Vi¦Äu said—</span>“MŒÄÎavya, when a kid, ignorantly inserted a straw in the anus of a cricket and left it there. He did not know at that time what is Dharma yet he had to suffer pain for one day and one night due to the effect of that fault. But as he was in trance, he could not feel the pain in full. Similarly the husband of PativratŒ in his previous life had killed a leper BrŒhmaÄa which caused in him a stinking leprosy. But since he had made four Gaur¶dŒnas and three KanyŒdŒnas so his wife became PativratŒ. It is due to his wife that he became just like Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa said—</span>“Lord, if a PativratŒ has so much glory, then whosoever has a wife who is not a flirt, is destined to heaven; is it so? A Sat¶ must be benedictory to all and sundry, isn’t it ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Lord said—</span>“Yes, so it is. There are certain women in the world so licentious who always act against their husbands how so ever faithful they might be to them. Such women who cannot be kept away from sinning, should not at all be owned. The women who are under the sway of sexual urge, entertain any man even if he may be poor, ugly, devoid of merit or even a servant from a low family. They can go to any extent, even embrace death. They desert their husbands although meritorious, high-bred, rich, handsome and expert in cohabiting art; and cherish mean persons. O BrŒhmaÄa, in this regard the dialogue between UmŒ and NŒrada is an example. NŒradaj¶ is well informed about feminine instincts. He is always inquisitive of knowing whatever happens in the world. Once he went to mount KailŒsa, the best among mountains, for some purpose in his mind. There the great sage saluted PŒrvat¶j¶ and asked—“Devi ! I want to know about the evil tendencies of the lustful women. I know nothing in this regard and am asking you most humbly. Please do tell”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">PŒrvat¶ said—</span>“NŒrada, young women always think of men only. There is no doubt. The woman is a jar of ghee and man is like burning amber. So fire and ghee must not be kept together. Just as the driver (Mahout) keeps an elephant under control with the help of goad and club, in the same way the guardian of a woman can control her only through chastisement. The woman is protected by her father in her childhood, by the husband in her youth and by the sons in her old age. She should never be left free. If a beautiful woman is left free on her own accord, she could get easily spoiled when approached by some man just as crows and dogs defile the food if it is unguarded, in the same way a free woman gets sexually corrupt. Then due to the contact of that corrupt woman, the entire family is polluted. The off shoot born of alien semen is called a bastard. A pious woman enhances glory of her father’s as well as her husband’s family and keeps them intact. A pious lady leads the family to liberation and the corrupt takes it to the hell. It is said that heaven, family-blemishness, fame, infamy, sons, daughters and friends—all depend on women. So a learned person may marry for the sake of progeny only. A sinner who spoils a chaste woman for his sensual desires and then deserts her, incurs sin of killing that woman and goes to hell. One who rapes another’s wife or sexually indulges with her by enticing her through the lure of money, he is named as the killer of woman and after death falls into the foulest hell. By abducting other’s wife one is reborn in CŒÄÎŒla family. In the same way a woman deceiving her husband undergoes infernal torture for a long time and then gets birth as a crow and lives on excreta and the refuses. And then she is reborn as a human and is due for widowhood. One who sexually indulges with the mother, Guru’s wife, a BrŒhmaÄa lady, a queen or a wife of some other lordly person, falls into the hell for an indefinite period. One who enjoys his sister, wife of the sister’s son, daughter, daughter-in-law, an aunt etc., also never gets release from hell. He who incurs sin of BrahmahatyŒ, becomes blind, deaf and dumb and goes on falling down and down with no chance of release.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The BrŒhmaÄa asked—</span>“O Lord, what is the way of liberation from such  a sin ?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord said—</span>“Such a sinner should have a feminine statue of iron made, have it heated red hot, should die of embracing that statue and go to other world after so being pure. One who renounces household life, fixes his mind on Me and chants My name Govinda daily, is freed from all sins. Thousands of BrahmahatyŒs, if cohabitation with Guru’s wife is done hundreds of times, drinking wine lacs of times, stealing gold, a prolonged contact with the sinners—these and some more great sins—all are instantly destroyed simply by remembering My name just as heaps of cotton burn to ashes as soon as they come in contact with fire. Therefore, it is imperative for men to remember My name ‘Govinda’ and become pure. (But the divine name does not save those who commit sins with the idea that the name will come to their rescue). Or even living in G¾hasthŒÜrama who daily chants Govinda and adores Me is liberated from all sins. By donating crores of cows on the bank of the GaÆgŒ, at an auspicious time of lunar eclipse, whatever virtue is earned—a thousand times more virtue occurs by chanting Govinda. A man who chants My name, always abides in VaikuÄ¢ha. One becomes equal to Me by hearing PurŒÄas and gets merged in Me. So PurŒÄas must be heard daily. PurŒÄa is a compilation of Dharma.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O best among BrŒhmaÄas, now I am going to describe the highest qualities found among the Sat¶ ladies. The progeny of a Sat¶ is pure, Lak¦m¶ always abides there. Her maternal family, the family of her husband as well as the husband—all attain heaven. Such women whose early life was spent with demeritorious and vicious indulgences and in their later period become PativratŒ, also attain My abode. The woman who serves her husband faithfully takes him— freed from all sins—also to heaven along with her even though he may be a drunkard or BrŒhmaÄa-killer and laden with all sorts of sins. She who makes herself Sat¶ with the dead body of her husband, is sure to get My abode; the woman, who truthfully follows her husband, lives in heaven as many years as there are hairs in the body of a person (three and a half crores). If the husband dies at some distant place and she gets some of his articles and makes herself Sat¶ with that, liberates him from all his sins. A PativratŒ should try to obtain some belonging of her husband if he dies somewhere else, and entering the funeral pyre with that belonging should make a journey towards heaven. If a BrŒhmaÄa woman burns herself alive with the dead body of her husband in the funeral fire, she becomes guilty of committing suicide due to which neither she herself reaches heaven nor can take her husband there. Therefore, a BrŒhmaÄa woman should not make herself Sat¶ with her dead husband—such is the instruction of Lord BrahmŒ. A BrŒhmaÄa widow should observe vow of widowhood. A widow who does not keep fast on EkŒdaÜ¶ day, becomes a widow in her next life also and misfortune always accompanies her in every birth to come. If she eats fish or meat and does not observe vows, she remains in hell for  a long time and then is reborn as a bitch. A widow who is a curse to her family, indulges in cohabitation, undergoes severe torture in hell and then gets birth as a vulture for ten consecutive lives, then remains as fox for two births and then is born as a human being. In that incarnation she becomes a widow in her young age and is compelled to work as maid servant.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa said—</span>“Lord, if you are kind to me then tellme about the merit of KanyŒdŒna and its right procedure.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord said—</span>“O BrŒhmaÄa, now listen to what merit occurs from donating daughter to a groom handsome, meritorious, high-bred, young, well to do and rich. One earns virtues accruing of donating the whole earth along with its mountains, forests and gardens by donating the virgin girl decorated with ornaments. The father who charges money in exchange of his daughter and uses it, goes to the hell. The fool who sells his daughter, is never liberated from hell. One who gives his daughter to an unworthy person out of greed, falls in Raurava and ultimately becomes CŒÄÎŒla. This is why learned persons do not even think of charging any fee from the son-in-law. On the other hand whatever is given to son-in-law, becomes inexhaustible. Inexhaustible virtue occurs from what is donated as dowry such as land, cow, gold, wealth and garments. Just as a broken rope drowns in the well along with the bucket, similarly if the donor forgets to give what he took SaÆkalpa for or the donee does not remind the donor, both fall into the hell. It is imperative for a pious person to give to his son-in-law what has been ear marked for the purpose. In case he fails to do so, he goes to hell and in addition to that he becomes a slave of the donee in his next life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">The six types of persons should be shunned in regard of KanyŒdŒna—a glutton, living far away, excessively rich, extremely wicked, from a low-bred family and one who is idiotic. Another six to be shunned—very much aged, apauper, sickly, living very near, shorttempered and discontented. By giving daughter to such persons one goes to the hell. One who donates his daughter for wealth or social prestige; or he who shows one girl but replaces her by another at the time of marriage—goes to hell. He who hears this highly virtuous episode, gets all his sins washed away.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">TulŒdhŒra praised for his truthfulness </p>
<p class="Uwach">The glory of truth; the KathŒ of a Ýµudra in regard of his greedlessness : Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla and others go to the final abode</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">BrŒhmaÄa said—</span>“O Lord ! if you are kind to me, then tell me about the life and unique glory of TulŒdhŒra.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord Said—</span>“He who gives up greed and guiles while always observing truth, performs as if hundreds of YajÛas accompanied by sumptuous fee daily. It is by the virtue of truth only that the Sun rises, the wind blows, the ocean always remains within its limit and Lord Kµurma holds the earth on His back. By truth only all the spheres and mountains hold their position. He who abandons truth, is sure to live in the hell. He who always speaks the truth and does good deeds, goes to the abode of the Lord and becomes Lord Himself. It is only by truth that all ¤R¦is and Munis attained Me and obtained eternity. It is by virtue of his truth that king Yudhi¦¢hira could go to heaven with his mortal body. He defeated all his enemies and ruled the country in a righteous manner. He performed RŒjasµuya, a rare and pure performance. He daily fed eighty-four thousand BrŒhmaÄas and donated to them enough money as desired by them. He let those BrŒhmaÄas go only when he was sure that their poverty has completely been abolished. It was all the glory of his truth. The king HariÜcandra is established in Satyaloka along with his vehicular means and family in his subtle form by wholly depending on truth. Besides them there have been many more kings, Siddhas, Mahar¦is, wise men and sacrificers who have never faltered from truth. Therefore only a truthful man is capable of liberating the world. The great souled TulŒdhŒra is established in truth. Because of this qualityof speaking the truth, there is no match of him in the world. This TulŒdhŒra never speaks untruth. He is clever in buying and selling of things costly as well as cheap.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Particularly the truthful statement of a witness is regarded to be of highest order. There have been many witnesses who have attained eternal heaven on account of their true speaking. One who speaks the truth  in a gathering of learned people goes to the abode of Lord BrahmŒ which is otherwise difficult to get through YajÛa etc. A person speaking the truth in a gathering earns virtue accruing from AÜvamedha. One goes to Raurava hell by telling lies due to greed or animosity. TulŒdhŒra is a spectator of everything. He is a sun among men. In nutshell  a man becomes a god in heaven by giving up greed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There has been a fortunate Ýµudra who never coveted for anything. He spent time with great difficulty by eating vegetables, by picking foodgrains from marketing centres and by picking paddy corns. He had only two clothes which were old and tattered and used his two hands as the only utensils. He never got anything yet he did not take anything belonging to anybody else. Once I went with two new clothes and put them in a corner on the bank of the river in order to test him. I stood aside at some distance. The Ýµudra saw those clothes but did not covet. He thought they might belong to somebody else. He went home. I thought it was a small thing to draw his attention and so he did not take those clothes. Again I took a gold piece and put it in a Gµular fruit and placed it there. It was Magadha country, the bank of a river, and absolutely a deserted place. At such a place he saw that wondrous fruit. At once said that it was all unnatural and concocted. If I take it, my sense of greedlessness will go to dogs. It is troublesome to safeguard wealth. It is a source of pride. The more one gets the more one’s sense of greed increases. Greed is born of gain. A greedy person always remains in the hell. If this worthless thing remains in my house, my wife and children will get intoxicated. The intoxication is an evolute of desire, which spoils the intellect. A misguided intellect creates infatuation and ego. They on their turn give birth to anger and greed. The excess of these will destroy penance. When penance perishes some sort of mental impurity causing the infatuation in the Citta (faculty of thinking) develops. Once fettered by impurity, the  man can never sublimate himself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, so thinking, that Ýµudra left the fruit there and went home. At that time gods in the heaven praised him carefully exclaiming “Well  done, well done”. Then I went to his house in the guise  of a mendicant and started forecasting of the future of the people there. Particularly I told their past. The news spread from mouth to mouth. The wife of the Ýµudra also came to Me and asked about the cause of her misfortune. I told her what she had in her mind. I took her in a secluded corner and said—“Fortunate lady, today providence gave you too much money but your husband, like a fool, has forsook it. There is no money at all in your house and so long as your husband is alive he has to suffer from poverty without any doubt. You go and ask him about that money. Hearing these good words she went to her husband and talked of this painful incident. The Ýµudra was startled. After some thinking he came to Me accompanied with his wife and told Me in a lonely place—“Mendicant, tell me what you were saying.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The mendicant said—</span>“Sir, you got money but you discarded it like straw, didn’t you? Why did you do so? It seems that there is no enjoyment in your lot. Not having wealth you will have to undergo misery throughout your life, not only you alone but your relatives also. Everyday your condition will be like that of a dead. Therefore, go and take that money and enjoy unhindered.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Ýµudra Said—</span>“O mendicant, I have no desire for money, wealth is a binding force that nets a person into the world. He who gets entangled in it, is never freed. Hear about the demerits of wealth whether in this world or in the other world. Wealth is always accompanied by fear from thieves, relatives and even king. Everybody intends to kill the wealthy person (in order to have that wealth). Then how can the wealth provide any comfort or joy? Wealth is a source of danger to the life and leads towards sin. The house of wealthy becomes an abode of KŒla (the principle of death) and many demerits like lust etc. Therefore wealth is the main source of degeneration.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The mendicant said—</span>“Only wealthy persons get friends. Everyone poses to be relative to a wealthy man. High family, good character, scholarliness, beauty, fame and comforts can be had by only wealthy men. Even wife and children desert a poor, what to talk of having friends? How can those perform a religious rite who are born paupers? The acts like performing sacrifices, or digging tanks etc., which lead to heaven, are impossible without wealth. Charity is a staircase to heaven which is not possible for a poor man to get. A pauper cannot perform any auspicious rite such as observing a vow, attending religious discourses, Pit¾yajÛa and going to holy centres nor can he fight diseases, nor can afford proper food, necessary medicines, personal protection and defeating enemy, such things are possible only through money. Thus only rich persons can acquire their desired objects. You can attain heaven through charity etc., but only if you have money.” </p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Ýµudra said—</span>“All vows are performed if no desires are entertained. By giving up anger all holy <span>T</span>¶rthas are visited. Kindness is equal to the Japa. Contentment is the purest among all riches. AhiÅsŒ is the biggest accomplishment. ÝiloÛcha is the best means of livelihood. The vegetables are the food like nectar. Observing fast is the best penance. Contentment is the best enjoyment. Donating just a cowry is the biggest donation to me. The other women are motherly to me and other’s wealth like a clod of mud. Other’s wife is like a cobra; this all is my sacrifice (that I perform). O treasure of merits, this is the reason why I do not accept that money. I am telling you the truth. It is better not to touch mud than wash the hands after touching it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord says—</span>“O best among men, no sooner the Ýµudra said so than did the gods shower flowers on his body and head. The divine drums sounded. Gandharvas sang. A chariot immediately came down from heaven. The gods said—O pious one ! do sit in the chariot and go to Satyaloka. Have divine enjoyments there till eternity. No time limit. Enjoy fruits of virtuous deeds. Having been said so by gods the Ýµudra spoke—“how did this mendicant acquire such knowledge, acting and speaking power? Is he not one of the gods like BrahmŒ, Vi¦Äu, Ýiva, Ýukra and B¾haspati in the guise of a mendican<span>t</span>? Is it not Dharma himself embodied to deceive me?” Having heard so I Who was there in the form of a mendicant, smiled and said—“O great sage, I am Vi¦Äu. I came here to test your piety. Now go to heaven along with your family.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After that the Ýµudra bedecked with divine clothes and ornaments suddenly went to heaven along with his family. This way the entire family of that Ýµudra went to heaven on account of renouncing greed. The wise TulŒdhŒra is saintly and he is established in truth. This is why he knows what happens in other places. There is no equal of TulŒdhŒra even in heaven. A person having faith in any religion, if hears this sacred episode, gets all his sins  accumulated in past births, washed off. The fruit of all YajÛas is obtained by reciting it only once. He gets respect in this world and is adored by gods in the other world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">VyŒsaj¶ says—</span>“After that all other pious men like Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla gathered around the Lord with the object of going to heaven. They had their wives and other family members also with them. Not only this but the raptiles, lizards and worms and insects of the vicinity were standing behind them in the form of gods with intention to go to heaven. At  that time gods, Siddhas and Mahar¦is praised and felicitated them by showering flowers. The heavenly drums sounded in the VimŒnas and in nearly forest. All those great souls mounted in their chariots and went totheabode of Vi¦Äu. BrŒhmaÄa Narottama witnessed all this unearthly scene and said to God—O Lord of the Lords ! O vanquisher of Madhu ! kindly do teach me something.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The Lord said—</span>“My dear, the heart of your parent is perturbed with grief. Go there and nurse and adore them. Doing so you will soon come to My abode. There are no gods equal to parents even in heaven. They brought you up when you were a dirty kid. You were quite ignorant. They have taught you knowledge. There is no other being—mobile and immobile in all the three worlds as adorable as parents are.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-6">VyŒsaj¶ says—</span>“After that the gods along with Mµuka CŒÄÎŒla, PativratŒ ÝubhŒ, TulŒdhŒra VaiÜya, SajjanŒ-drohaka and the Vai¦Äava saint—all the five went to VaikuÄ¢ha DhŒma while cheerfully praising God. They all were allotted a place higher than any other Loka and they had the form of Acyuta Himself. Narottama also served his parent with all care and not before long obtained the abode of the Lord with all his family. O disciples, I have narrated to you these episodes of five MahŒtmŒs. One who will recite or hear this episode, will never be degenerated. He will never get affected by sins like BrahmahatyŒ even. Hearing this episode only once a person can have that virtue which accrues from donating crores of cows or bathing at Pu¦kara or in the GaÆgŒ.”<span class="char-style-override-11" xml:lang="en-GB"></span></p>
