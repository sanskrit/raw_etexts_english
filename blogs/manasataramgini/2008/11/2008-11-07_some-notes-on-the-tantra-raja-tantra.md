+++
The tantra-rAja is a key shrI-kula tantra that forms the basis for many
of the practices of the kAdimata. The paTala 34 lists the key vidyA-s
which are very important for the attainment of various puruShArtha-s of
the kaula practitioners. The study of paTala 34 with its mantra-s, their
rahasya-s and oShadhi-s are important for a deshika in the making as a
part of his basic curriculum in the mantra-shAstra. The mantra-s are:
siddha-sArasvata; mR^ityunjaya; tripUTA; garuDa; ashvArUDhA;
annapUrNA-devI; navAtman and kubjikA as navAtmikA; devIhR^idaya; gaurI;
lakShadA; niShkatrayapradA; iShTadAyinI; mata\~nginI, rajyalakShmI;
mahalakShmI, siddhalakShmI and the multiple gopAla mantra-s. Then the
chapter describes oShadhi-s which are used to produce visions of various
devatA-s.

The commentary of prakAshAnanda-nAtha deshika:

siddha-sArasvataM= aiM hrIM hsrIM h-s-sv-phrem h-s-h-hrauH ||

In actual practise R1â€™s father indicated the use of aiM hrIM hsrIM
h-s-kh-phrem h-s-h-hrauH which would require an emendation of the
svakara to khakara, but it could also be a parallel tradition. The rare
bIja h-s-sv-phrem is also encountered in the shrIkula tripurArchana
krama while showing the khecharI mudra.

For dhyAna the form of amR^iteshvarI is described in the earlier paTala
is recommended. Even though prakAshAnanda says that it is in the
sapta-viMshati paTala, in reality the dhyAna is found in the
ShaDviMshati paTala of the extant tantra-rAja text. This means he has
either made a mistake or had a different text with one extra chapter
with him.  
amR^iteshvarI dhyAnaM:  
* shuddha-sphaTika-sa\~NkAshAM mauli-vad-dhendu-nirgataiH |  
amR^itair-Ardra-dehAstAstv-amalAbharaNAnvitAH ||  
kumudaM puNDarIka\~Nka\~ncha rAkendum-amR^itaM karaiH |  
dadhAnAH smera-vadanA muktAbharaNa-bhuShitAH ||* (TR26.64-65)

It is interesting to note that the siddha-sArasvataM mantra is just
prior to that of amR^iteshvara bhairava or the mR^ityu\~njaya (OM jUM
saH) in the TR. This suggests that they come as a pair from a system
like that of the netra tantra. Also we find that the dhyAna given for
this mantra is that of devI amR^iteshvarI. This dhyAna is a cognate of
the devI parA, a link we have discussed earlier. Importantly, the
prayoga of the siddha-sArasvataM involves giving a girl with blemishless
body a drink of milk charmed by the mantra. This is said to result in
her speaking like sarasvatI and know the past, present and future. This
is reminiscent of the deployment of the parA-related mantra like bAlA in
gaining poesy as per the suggestion of kShemendra. It might also be
related to the kanyAkumAra (probably kanyAkumAri) mantra of rAjashekhara
recommended for the same purpose.

The dhyAna for amR^iteshvara bhairava for the mR^ityu\~njaya mantra is
given thus:  
*Adya-madya-tR^itIyaarNa-nAla-padma-sukarNike |  
samAsInaM sudhArdrA\~NgaM maulAbindu-kalA-yutam ||  
susitaM hariNaakSha-srak-chintA-pAsha-karaM haram |  
svaikyena bhAvayen-nityaM jaya-dIrghaayuredhate ||* TR 34.13-14

The first letter (OM) is conceived as being on the stalk of a white
lotus, the second letter (jUM) on the petals and the third saH on the
pericarp. Seated on this lotus is conceived amR^iteshvara of excellent
white complexion, with his body imbrued by nectar and bearing a crest
moon on his head, holding a deer, rosary, displaying the chinta
(vyAkhyAna) mudra, and a lasso. The ritualist who mediates thus,
conscious of his oneness with hara attains victory and a long life.
