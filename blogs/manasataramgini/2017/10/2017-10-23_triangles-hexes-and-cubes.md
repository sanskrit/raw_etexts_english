One philosophical question which we have often ponder about is: Are
numbers “real”? One way to approach this question is via figurate
numbers, where numbers directly manifest as very tangible geometry. This
idea has deep roots in our tradition: as we have noted before, [the
square numbers and their link to odd
numbers](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/syllable-number-and-rules-in-the-ideal-realm/)
is directly represented in the square vedi-s of the śrauta ritual.
Another basic type of figurate numbers, the triangular numbers, are
presented in the [early yavana philosophical tradition of the
Pythagoreans and play an important role in Platonic
thought](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/09/26/hayastanika-samkhya-plato-etc/).
Thus, we suspect that contemplation on figurate numbers played an
important role in the ancestral philosophical tradition on the ārya-s
and the yavana-s. Here we will illustrate some well-known and basic
features of figurate numbers to show how geometric conceptualization of
them allows one to easily understand and derive certain properties of
theirs.

![triangular\_numbers](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/triangular_numbers.png?w=640)Figure

Figure 1 depicts triangular numbers
![T\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"T_n"). We see that they simply emerge from appropriately arranging rows
of counters amounting to successive Natural numbers i.e. the set
![\\mathbb{N}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\mathbb{N}"). Thus, the geometric figure, the triangle, is directly
implied by the existence
![\\mathbb{N}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\mathbb{N}"). From Figure 1 we also see that the nth
![T\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"T_n") itself represents the sum of natural numbers from 1:n. This is
the famous sum of the basic arithmetic series which is first indicated
in [Vedic tradition as derived by the ancient sage
Śākapūṇi](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/03/11/jatavedase-and-shredhi-vyavahara/).
It was subsequently expounded by Āryabhaṭa-I in his Āryabhaṭiyam. The
medieval scientist Nārāyaṇa paṇḍita gives an old sūtra for it thus:  
saika-pada-ghna-padārdhaṃ saṃkalitam |  
sa+eka+pada ![\\rightarrow
(n+1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow+%28n%2B1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\rightarrow (n+1)"); ghna: multiply; padārdhaṃ ![\\rightarrow
\\tfrac{n}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow+%5Ctfrac%7Bn%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\rightarrow \\tfrac{n}{2}"); yields saṃkalitam (sum of series). Thus,

![T\_n=\\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2} \\rightarrow 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45,
55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210
...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%7D%7B2%7D+%5Crightarrow+1%2C+3%2C+6%2C+10%2C+15%2C+21%2C+28%2C+36%2C+45%2C+55%2C+66%2C+78%2C+91%2C+105%2C+120%2C+136%2C+153%2C+171%2C+190%2C+210+...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"T_n=\\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2} \\rightarrow 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210 ...")

2. This demonstration is given by the great scientist-mathematician
Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājin and others like the Munīśvara Viśvarūpa.

By looking at figure 2 the proof for the above formula becomes
self-evident. By looking at figure 1 and working our way along
successive numbers we notice that we can reach any natural number by
means of a sum of at most 3 triangular numbers, like the 3 steps of
Viṣṇu spanning the universe. This result was formally proved by Carl
Gauss at age 19 following up on his auto-discovery of the sum of the
simple arithmetic series as a child. Related to this, is the fractal
structure that emerges when we represent triangular numbers in binary
(base 2) following a device of Stephen Wolfram (Figure 3).

[![triangular\_binary](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/triangular_binary.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/triangular_binary.png)Figure
3. The triangular numbers up to
![T\_{511}=130816](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_%7B511%7D%3D130816&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"T_{511}=130816")

We had earlier seen how the problem of determining which triangular
number is also a square number led to the famous indeterminate equation,
which was generally tackled by the old Hindus using the cakravāla
algorithm and how it yields approximations for
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{2}"). Other relationships between triangular numbers
![T\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"T_n") and square numbers
![S\_m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"S_m") can be easily found using the above construction of Nīlakaṇṭha
(Figure 4).

![triangle\_square](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/triangle_square.png?w=640)Figure
4

From Figure 4 it is self-evident that,

![T\_n+T\_{n+1}=S\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_n%2BT_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3DS_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"T_n+T_{n+1}=S_{n+1}")  
![8T\_n+1=S\_{2n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=8T_n%2B1%3DS_%7B2n%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"8T_n+1=S_{2n+1}")

Triangular numbers and related figurate numbers also relate to
arithmetic problems which captured the attention of the Hindu
mathematicians over the ages. For example, if we pile triangles formed
by the triangular numbers one atop the next then we get a 3D figurate
number, the tetrahedral number (figure 5). The tetrahedron thus formed
had [significance in Platonic
thought](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/09/26/hayastanika-samkhya-plato-etc/).

![tetrahedral\_numbers](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tetrahedral_numbers.png?w=640)Figure
5

From the above figure it is apparent that the tetrahedral numbers
(![Te\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Te_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Te_n")) are nth sums of triangular numbers. Āryabhaṭa-I gives the
formula for the nth sum of triangular numbers by the sūtra:  
ṣaḍbhaktaḥ sa citighanaḥ saikapadaghano vimūlaḥ |  
sa citighanaḥ: Sum of sum of natural numbers is called citighana;
ṣaḍbhaktaḥ ![\\rightarrow \\div
6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow+%5Cdiv+6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\rightarrow \\div 6"); sa+eka+pada+ghanaḥ ![\\rightarrow
(n+1)^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow+%28n%2B1%29%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\rightarrow (n+1)^3"); vimūlaḥ ![\\rightarrow
-(n+1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow+-%28n%2B1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\rightarrow -(n+1)") (literally subtract cube root of previous term).
Thus we have,  
![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{j=1}^n
T\_n=Te\_n=\\dfrac{(n+1)^3-(n+1)}{6}=\\dfrac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+T_n%3DTe_n%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%28n%2B1%29%5E3-%28n%2B1%29%7D%7B6%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bn%28n%2B1%29%28n%2B2%29%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n T_n=Te_n=\\dfrac{(n+1)^3-(n+1)}{6}=\\dfrac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}")

[![triangular\_number\_sum](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/triangular_number_sum.png?w=700&h=342)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/triangular_number_sum.png)Figure
6. Sum of triangular number demonstrated by Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājin.

Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājin illustrates the geometric proof for this in his
commentary on Āryabhaṭa (Figure 6). The term citighana (literally
stacked solid) implies that Āryabhaṭa had 3D sense of it similar to
constructions with bricks performed during the piling of citi-s or
ritual altars in the śrauta ritual. The earliest Hindu temples, known as
caitya also stem from the same root implying the piling of bricks. The
relationship of these terms to the piling of citi-s was first pointed
out by TA Sarasvati Amma but mostly ignored by others.

The ghanacitighana laid out by Āryabhaṭa-I and subsequently commented
upon by many mathematicians is computation of the nth sum of cubes of
natural numbers. Āryabhaṭa’s sūtra is:  
citi-vargo ghanacitighanaḥ |  
citi ![\\rightarrow \\sum\_{j=1}^n
j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crightarrow+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\rightarrow \\sum_{j=1}^n j"); vargaḥ: squared; yields sum of cubes of
natural numbers (ghanacitighanaḥ). We can use triangular numbers to
easily derive this formula (Figure 7)

![cube\_cutting](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/cube_cutting.png?w=640)Figure
7. The sum of cubes of natural numbers.

We construct a square slab of unit cubes with each side of length equal
to a triangular number. Thus, the total number of cubes in the slab is
![T\_n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"T_n^2"). We then dissect the slab such that we separate the pieces
shown in different colors first. Then we dissect each color piece
further along the grey slicers. These divide the pieces into either
square slabs or half-square slabs of unit cubes. We then assemble these
slabs into cubes of the same color. This demonstrates that,  
![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{j=1}^n j^3
=T\_n^2=\\dfrac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+j%5E3+%3DT_n%5E2%3D%5Cdfrac%7Bn%5E2%28n%2B1%29%5E2%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n j^3 =T_n^2=\\dfrac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}")  
Thus, the nth sum of cube numbers is the square of the nth triangular
number.

We may next consider the Hex numbers
![H\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"H_n") which are depicted in Figure 8. Such a figure plays an important
role in the positioning of deities in maṇḍala-s in the āgamika
tradition. We also encounter it as a packing principle in nature.

![Hex\_numbers](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/hex_numbers.png?w=640)Figure
8

We see that they are centered hexagons and based on the figure we can
infer their general formula and relationship to triangular numbers:  
![H\_n=3n^2-3n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_n%3D3n%5E2-3n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"H_n=3n^2-3n+1"); ![n=
1,2,3,4...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D+1%2C2%2C3%2C4...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n= 1,2,3,4...")  
![H\_n=6T\_k+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_n%3D6T_k%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"H_n=6T_k+1");
![k=0,1,2,3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D0%2C1%2C2%2C3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k=0,1,2,3...")  
The latter relationship can be seen by dissecting the hexagon into six
triangular sectors of dots making the triangular number
![T\_k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"T_k") after leaving out the central dot. Further, we see that a hex
number is always of the form
![3m+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3m%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"3m+1") where
![m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "m") is
0 or an integer. The hex numbers are the 3D figurate equivalent odd
numbers: [In the old śrauta altar construction successive odd numbers of
bricks](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/syllable-number-and-rules-in-the-ideal-realm/)
form right-angled “shells” that nest into the next such shell to
constitute larger and larger squares. We may likewise ask if this can be
extended to 3D, such that we have shells which nest into each other to
constitute a cube (Figure 9).

![Hex\_cubes](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/hex_cubes.png?w=640)Figure
9

From figure 9 we observe that based on the geometry of the hex number we
can arrange in 3D to constitute such a cubic shell. By nesting
successive shells of hex numbers we constitute a cube. Thus we get,  
![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{j=1}^n H\_j
=n^3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+H_j+%3Dn%5E3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^n H_j =n^3")  
This tells us that just as the difference between successive square
numbers is an odd number the difference between successive cube numbers
is a hex number.

In conclusion, the study of figurate numbers might be seen as having
their origin in old Greco-Aryan religious tradition. In Greece they took
an important place in philosophy whereas in India, beyond the ritual
tradition, their more general study assumed a form somewhat closer to
their modern counterparts. While Hindus were generally less-inclined
towards geometry than their Greek counterparts, this is one area where
the Hindus developed a unique unbroken tradition of “geometric algebra”
that clearly stretches from the Vedic tradition via Āryabhaṭa-I to the
later savants. That older root of it is evident from the fact that even
in the period of regionalization, the tradition was similarly but
independently continued in disparate parts of the Hindu nation. We see
demonstrations of geometric algebra in the south in the famous school of
Nīlakaṇṭha Somayājin and his successors like
[Citrabhānu](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/09/22/citrabhanus-cubes/)
and Śaṃkara Vāriār; in Maharashtra by Gaṇeśa daivajña and his clansmen;
in North India even under Islamic tyranny by the Raṅganātha-Munīśvara
school.

The study of figurate numbers continues into modern mathematics. We
noted above the discovery of Gauss on triangular numbers. Before him the
Leonhard Euler generalized the concept of the root to figurate numbers.
The square root of a number
![y=\\sqrt{x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Csqrt%7Bx%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=\\sqrt{x}") is a generalization coming from the
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n") as
the root of the square number
![n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n^2"). Euler showed that similarly
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "y"), a
general triangular root of
![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "x"),
can be defined as the solution of the quadratic equation
![y^2+y-2x=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%5E2%2By-2x%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y^2+y-2x=0"),  
![y=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{8x+1}-1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B8x%2B1%7D-1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{8x+1}-1}{2}")  
We get ![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y") to be an integer only when
![x=T\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3DT_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=T_n"); then
![y=n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dn&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=n"). Thus, only if
![\\sqrt{x}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bx%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{x}") and its triangular root are simultaneously integers it is
both a square and a triangular number. In the below table we show the
first few numbers which are both triangular and square along with their
square root and triangular root.

Table 1.

``` 
 sqrt   troot   Sn/Tm
-----  ------  ------

   35      49    1225
  204     288   41616
```

From these numbers we can see that we can compose simultaneously square
and triangular numbers by the two seeded series:  
![S\[n\]=34\\cdot
S\[n-1\]-S\[n-2\]+2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5Bn%5D%3D34%5Ccdot+S%5Bn-1%5D-S%5Bn-2%5D%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"S[n]=34\\cdot S[n-1]-S[n-2]+2"); where ![S\[0\]=0,
S\[1\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%5B0%5D%3D0%2C+S%5B1%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"S[0]=0, S[1]=1")

Similarly, the solution
![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "y")
for the equation
![3y^2-3y+1-x=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3y%5E2-3y%2B1-x%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"3y^2-3y+1-x=0") provides the hex root of a number,  
![\\dfrac{3+\\sqrt{9-12(1-x)}}{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B3%2B%5Csqrt%7B9-12%281-x%29%7D%7D%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

Whereas a square number is never prime and
![T\_2=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T_2%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"T_2=3") is the only prime triangular number, the general formula for
hex numbers is a fairly rich prime-generating  
quadratic. For instance there are 58 ![H\_n|
n\<10000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_n%7C+n%3C10000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"H_n| n\<10000") of which 28 are prime:
![pf=0.4827586](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=pf%3D0.4827586&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"pf=0.4827586"). For comparison we draw 58 numbers 10000 taking into
account the following: 1) hex numbers are always odd; 2) they are not
evenly distributed: the first 100 has 6 hex number while the next 100
has only 2. Thus, we make the clustering pattern of our draws identical
to that of hex numbers in windows of 100. Doing a simulation with these
constraints we get a probability of the prime fraction in draws of 58
numbers being
![pf=0.4827586](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=pf%3D0.4827586&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"pf=0.4827586") or higher to be of the order of ![\\approx
