*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

NEW YORK

*28 June 1894*

DEAR MOTHER,

Arrived safely two hours ago. Landsberg[1](#fn1) was waiting at the
station. Came to Dr. Guernsey's house. Nobody was there except a
servant. I took a bath and strolled with Landsberg to some restaurant
where I had a good meal. Then, I have just now returned to Landsberg's
rooms in the Theosophical Society and am writing you this letter.

I haven't been to see my other friends yet. After a good and long rest
through the night I hope to see most of them tomorrow. My Love to you
all. By the by, somebody stepped on my umbrella on board the train and
broke its nose off.

Your affectionate son,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS — I have not settled myself. So as to direct letters to me, they can
be directed c/o Leon Landsberg, 144 Madison Ave., New York.
