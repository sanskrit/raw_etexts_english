BOSTON,  
*26th Sept, 1894*.

DEAR SISTER, (Isabelle McKindley)

Your letter with the India mail just to hand. A quantity of newspaper
clippings were sent over to me from India. I send them back for your
perusal and safe keeping.

I am busy writing letters to India last few days. I will remain a few
days more in Boston.

With my love and blessings,

Yours ever affly.,

VIVEKANANDA.
