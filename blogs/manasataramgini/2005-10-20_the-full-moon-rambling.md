title = "The full moonxa0rambling"

On the past fullmoon several years ago when we were still young we were
seated in the pleasant company of the apsaras and drinking the wonderful
pAyasa. We were yarning about the events in the mundane plane of
existence, when the foremost of the sutanUs asked what was the simplest
chaturti vrata to the terrible ulka and how may it be performed. We
found the appropriate answer for the same after some thought. It is the
ulka vrata of oM gaH svAhA. It may be done by all to attain release from
vighnas.
