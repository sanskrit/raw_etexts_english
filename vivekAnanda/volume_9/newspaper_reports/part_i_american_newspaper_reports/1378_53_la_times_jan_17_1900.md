## THE RELIGIOUS LEGENDS OF INDIA

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 5, p. 269.)

\[*Los Angeles Times*, January 17, 1900\]

The Swami

Clad in his maroon robe, Swami Vivekananda addressed a small audience
composed mostly of women, at the Shakespeare Club this evening \[January
16\]. (Of which no verbatim transcript is available.) He gave an account
of the religious legends of Brahmanism, which are embodied in the daily
lives of the Hindus, of the origin of Shiva and his surrender to the
pure spirit of his wife, today the mother of all India, whose worship is
carried to such an extent that no female animal can be killed.
Vivekananda quoted freely from the Sanskrit, translating as he went
along. . . .
