title = "The festival of kAma"

+++
From a somewhat corrupt, but legible copy of the padma purANa, I have
been able to piece together the most complete version of the damanaka
utasava vidhi for kAma and rati. I provide it here as a part of my
ongoing project of creating critical vidhis for ancient Hindu festivals
( for after all the learned have said the shAstra is more authoritative
than prayoga).

Source: padma purANa, uttara kANDa, 84.  
Day: chitra; shukla pakSha; dvAdashi.  
Rite:In a sylvan grove, idols of rati and kAma are installed with the
mantra:

**kAmadeva namaste.astu vishvamohana kAraka **  
**viShNorarathe vicheshyAmi kR^ipAM kuru mamopari **

Then the idols are brought home to with accompanying music and
singing.The idols are installed in the indra disha or the eastern
quarter after sunset. The whole worship is conducted after sunset.An
auspicious circle is drawn around the idols and the idols are clothed in
white cloth.They are decorated with the shoots of the damanaka plant.The
deities are worshipped with the formulae:

**oM klIM kAmadevAya namaH **  
**oM hrIM ratyai namaH **  
The the deities are devotely worshiped with sandal paste, flowers,
incense and lamp-waving with the following formulae:  
**oM madanAya namaH (east)**  
**manmathAya namaH (Southeast)**  
**kandarpAya namaH (south)**  
**ana\~ngAya namaH (south-west)**  
**bhasma sharIrAya namaH (west)**  
**smarAya namaH (North-East)**

**IshvarAya namaH (north)**

**puShpa-bANAya namaH (northeast)**

Then they offer turmeric stained rice, festive eatables (bhakShaNas),
and tAmbUlas (paan)Then they meditate of kAma by performing the kAma
gAyatri japa 108 times:  
**tat puruShAya vidhmahe kAmadevAya dhimahi . tanno.ana\~nagaH
prachodayAt ..**

A pitcher of water is placed before the idols Then the following
formulae are recited:  
**namo.astu puShpabANaya jagadAhlAdakAriNe manmathAya jagannetra rati
prItikarAya cha**  
**devadeva namaste.astu shri vishvesha namo.astute  
ratipate namaste.astu namaste.astu vishvamaNDana  
**  
**namaste.astu jagannatha sarvabIja namo.astute  
**

feet of the idols are washed with water from the pitcher.Then there is a
great celebration with song, music, dance and a Holi-styled
splashing-sports.
