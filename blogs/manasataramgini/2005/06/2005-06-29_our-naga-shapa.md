title = "Our nAga shApa"

It is said that when pANDus conquered khANDava from the nAgas they got
the curse of the nAgas. For the sake of khANDava they lost most of their
sons. In the next generation parIkShit lost his life due to the nAga and
so on.

We had earlier alluded to the seizure of our khANDava in what seemed a
successful campaign. A little did we know that we were headed to worst
of the existential crises we had ever faced as result of our possession
of khANDava. It looked as though our favors from the gods had run out
now. The attack now extended on all fronts. Jx had said that cell phones
were harmless devices, but we learned to our horror there were some
which even came with bombs, leave alone cameras. Jx received a strike.
The big eater received another but survived after some bad effects. The
learned muni himself was struck but some how survived. Some of our
dependents were struck badly and one of our great treasures were robbed.
pretas issued forth from the floor. When Marc and R had visited
Hayastanika they obtained the latterâ€™s message for me. The Abrus seeds
had fallen out of the window and now a deadly grove of plants grew
there. We were never so bereft of energy and were at our wits end. We
had then spoken of kumbhakarNa and the missiles failing at him. It was
now as though we were in a kArAgR^iha of rAvaNa.
