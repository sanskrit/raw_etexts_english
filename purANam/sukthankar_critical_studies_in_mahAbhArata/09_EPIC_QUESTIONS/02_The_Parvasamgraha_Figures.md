The Parvasamgrahaparvan (Adi, adhy. 2) is a document of considerable 
importance.^ But its value has been unduly exaggerated by some scholars, 
a circumstance which has led to some highly misleading results and some 
curious conclusions It is thus supposed that Kr^na Dvaipayana Vyasa had 
himself counted and noted down the number of slokas he had composed, and 
that our Parvasamgraha was composed by Vyasa himself. No doubt it is 
sometimes stated in the Parvasarhgraha chapter that that sage had stated the 
extent of each of the eighteen parvans. But this attribution to Vyasa is 
naturally only pujarthe {honoris causa). It is nowhere suggested in the work 
itself that the first two adhyiayas of our epic were composed by Vyasa. They 
could not be, because they are obviously only a report of the conversation 
which took place between the Suta (Ugrasravas, son of Lomahar?ana) and 
the sages assembled at iSaunaka's twelve-year sacrifice in the Naimisa Forest. 
The erroneous supposition regarding the authorship of this adhyaya has led 
to the naive attempt on the part of some scholars to produce a text — a so- 
called critical text — of the Mahabharata containing the same number of 
adhyayas and slokas as that given in the Parvasarhgraha. Such an attempt 
is already negatived by our manuscripts and testimonia, which contain many 
variants of the figures in the Parvasarhgraha. Thus the figures for the Adi- 
parvan itself vary, according to different sources, between 7984 (Ka4mir|i 
Version and the Critical Edition) and 9984 (Andhra-6haratamu) . That is 
sufficient to discourage any attempt at too close a reliance on the data of this 
adhyaya of the Adiparvan. It has been common experience that figures in 
ancient works, if at all complicated, seldom come out right, and the figures 
of the Parvasamgraha are probably no exception to this rule.

but an accurate statement. And I have tried to substantiate this in this edition 
of the Principal Text of the Southern Recension.”

in one of many different ways. The most probable suggestion has been that 
they were arrived at, not by actual counting of the stanzas, as we should ordi- 
narily do now, but by computing the extent in some other way. Even now 
we speak of a story of 5000 words or a broadcast talk of 1500 words, and so 
on. The individual words are never counted in such computations ; the 
figures are only approximations. The figures given in our Parvasarhgraha 
chapter must be approximations of that type. They are not “ slokas"’ or 
stanzas as we ordinarily understand them ; but are, properly speaking, what 
are technically known as, “ granthas,’' a grantha being a unit of measurement 
of written matter equal to 32 ak^aras. 

Assuming this to be the case, the first difficulty is that the figures given 
in the lists appear not as round numbers, as we should expect them to be, but 
are apparently correct to the last digit ; for instance, the extent is given not 
as 8000 slokas, but as 7987. We actually come across such figures as these : 
6698, 7998, 8909, 14525, where true approximations would be 6700, 8000, 

8900, 14,500, and so on. The approximation seems to me to have been 

reached by some such process as this. First, an average was obtained by 
counting carefully all letters in a certain number of lines. This average was 
then multiplied by the number of lines in a page and the total number of 
complete pages. The number of “ granthas ” of the last page, which was 
rarely fully written out, seems to have been computed separately, and added 
to the previous total. The grand total of letters (ak^aras) was then divided 
by 32 to give the number of “ slokas or “ granthas,’’ fractions being omit- 
ted. That is how figures like those mentioned above must have been ob- 

tained. They are careful approximations, but approximations all the same. 
Moreover, as has been pointed out by me elsewhere,^ it would be impossible 
to count the exact number of stanzas in a composite text made up of slokas, 
tri§tubhs, “ fancy metres ” and prose passages, which we actually find in many 
of the parvans of the Mahabharata, as for instance in the Adi, Arapyaka and 
Anusasana. 

The figures we find in the Parvasamgraha chapter are fairly old ; we 
cannot say now exactly how old. They are certainly prior to 1000 A. D., 
when tlfe Javanese Bhdrata and the Andhra Bhdratamu were composed ; be- 
cause both these works contain similar lists, which agree in many particulars 
with our list. 

Here are the figures given in three different sources.

kPlC QUESTIONS 11 4^ 

{552} The above is a conspectus of the figures for the adhyayas and slo- 
kas of the eighteen parvans of the Mahabhiarata according to (1) the Criti- 
cal Edition, (2) the Javanese Version,^ and (3) the Southern Recension by 
Professor P. P. S. Sastri. 

Observations on the Figures of the above Table. 

I. Adi : The first figure (8) of the Javanese number for the adhyayas 
of the Adi (818) is obviously wrong ; the other digits agree in the three texts. 
So we may take as correct the figures 218 , *2 which is given us by the Critical 
Edition and Southern Recension, the Vulgate reading (227) being certainly 
a mistake. — The number of slokas is no doubt a problem. I have adopted 
the figures given by the ;§aradia MS. and one “ K ” MS. (Ki),^ which is con- 
firmed by the Rajaguru MS. from Nepal,^ and I am still inclined to suppose 
that that was the original figure. The Javanese and Southern figures 8884 and 
9884 respectively differ by 1000 exactly, the Javanese figure being the same 
as that of the Mid-Indian group (Bengali-Devanagari). 

II. Sabhd : Tbe numbers are here absolutely certain. As regards the 
adhyayas, there is perfect agreement between the three sources, all of them 
giving 72, which is also the exact number of adhyiayas of our Critical Edi- 
tion of the Sabhia now passing through the press. The Vulgate figure (78) 
for the sloka is therefore unquestionably wrong. — The sloka number is also 
certainly 2511, as the Southern Recension, in which the first figure has been 
increased to 4, is demonstrably inflated to make it conform with the inter- 
polated text, and the additional stanzas of the Southern Recension do 
approximately amount to 2()(X). The correct figures for Sabha are therefore 72 
and 2511. 

{553} III. Aranyaka (commonly known as Vana) : As regards the 
adhyayas, the Javanese records 272 against the concordant figure 269 of all 
Indian version^. The latter may be taken to be the right figure, the discre- 
pancy of the Javanese, which is negligible, remaining unexplained. — The 
same is true of the figure for the slokas, the concordant figure (11,664) of 
all Indian versions being the original Parvasamgraha figure. 

IV. Virdfa : The Javanese figure for the adhyayas is unfortunately 
missing. But as our Critical Edition of the Virataparva has successfully 


1 The figures for the Javanese Version have been taken from JfUYNBOLL's Adi- 
parwa, Oudjavaansch prazageschrijt, Gravenhage, 1906. pp. 5-6. The passage is re- 
produced in a note by H. Kern, “ Inhoudsopgave van T Mahabharata in T Ka- 
wi ” in Bijdfagen, set III, Vol. IV, pp. 92-95, Kern has given in this paper a com- 
parative table of the Indian and the Javanese figures. 

2 Kern, op, cit., p. 95 also remarks that the Javanese figure 818 is incorrect, 
and that it ^ould be 218.

identified the adhyiayas on the basis of the colophons given in MSS., there is 
no reason to doubt that the correct figure is 67, as given by the Sanskrit 
Parvaisarhgraha. — The three sources give three different figures for the slokas. 
The Southern Recension is obviously inflated, and may therefore be ignored, 
its figure having been revised — as in Sabha — ^to accord with its interpolated 
text. It is likely that the Javanese translator has confused the Sahskrit words 
for 50 and 15 {pmcasat and pancadaia). The first two digits of the figures 
given in the Critical Edition alnd the Javanese Version do agree. We may 
therefore reasonably assume the original figure to be 2050, which is given by 
the Critical Edition of the Parvasamgraha, though the two last digits natu- 
rally remain somewhat uncertain.^ 

V. Udyoga : The three sources agreeing exactly as regards the num- 
ber of adhydyas of the Udyoga, the figure 186 may be taken as certain. — The 
figures for the slokas, on the other hand, are in a chaotic condition, the three 
texts giving three different figures 6698, 6928, 7998 ; which agree only in 
respect of the last digit ! The figures for the slokas remain, therefore, 
doubtful. 

VI. iBhi^ma : The number of adhydyas in the Bhii§ma is given by the 
Critical Edition and the Javanese Version as 117, but the Southern Recension 
gives their number as 118. In any case, the difference is not very significant, 
and the number may be assumed to be 117 or 118 — There is no such doubt re- 
garding the number of slokas, which is unanimously given as 5884. 

VII. Drom : There is likewise considerable agreement as regards the 
adhydyas and slokas of the Dronja. The adhydya number {554} is 170. — As 
regards the number of slokas, the first two digits (89) are certain. And since 
both the Critical Edition and the Southern Recension agree on the figure 8909, 
that is indicated as the correct figure. The probability in fafvour of this 
figure is strengthened owing to the circumstance that the last two figures of 
the Javanese Version (84) are in all probability due tp contamination with 
the previous sldsa-figure 5884, which ends in 84. We may therefore adopt 
with confidence the concordant figure of the Indian versions 8909, the differ- 
ence between the Javanese and the Indian numbers being 75 ; the 
error is in any event not more than 1 per cent. 

VIII. : The figures for Kanja are exactly of the same type. 
The three sources agree in giving 69 as the number of adhydyas.— The Java- 
nese MSS. give ithe number of slokas as 970, which is obviously wrong, it 
being almost certain that the word for 4000 has been omitted by the scribe 
by oversight f so we get the original Javanese figure as [4]970. We may

‘‘Epic studies (III)/^ ABORT vol, 11, pp. 277 ff. 

* Kern, toe, cit,, also recognizes that the first figure has been .omitted by 
nfistake in the Javanese text. 



EPIC QUESTIONS II

tentatively adopt the figure 4900, on the concordant evidence of Indian ver- 
sions. The difference between the Indian and Javanese figures being only 
70, the discrepancy is only about 1-4 per cent. 

IXi. Salya : In this parvan there is fortunately no doubt about the 
sloka number, which is unanimously given a‘s 3220. — And again, fortunately, 
as regards the adhyaya number, the discrepancy between the Indian (59) and 
Javanese (121) figures is so great that the Javanese may be ruled out as 
hopelessly corrupt. There is another test we may apply, the Javanese figure^ 
(121) for adhyayas gives the average of about 27 slokas to an adhyaya, while 
the Indian average is 54. Now the total number of adhyayas in the Maha- 
bharata i^ supposed to be 2000, and the number of stanzas 100,000 (^ta- 
sahasriaiui® ) , which ogives the average of slokas to an adhyaya as 50 and that 
is much nealrer the average for the Indian figure for the adhyiaya number of 
the 6alyaparvani than the Javanese figure. 

X. Sauptika : The figures for the Sauptika call for no remarks. They 
are uniformaly given in all thel three sources as 18 and 870 respectively. 

£555} XI. Strl : The sources do not agree as regards the number 
of adhyayas, but the Javanese figure (70) which is nearly two and half times 
as large as the Indian (27) is extremely improbable.^ We may therefore 
tentatively take the concordant Indian figure (27) as correct. — The difference 
between the Javanese and Indian figures for the slokas is only five. It would 
seem that the last digit waS lost in the Javanese tradition ; if that be so, the 
correct number is 775, as given unanimously by the Indian MSS. 

XII. Sdnti : The sloka figure for Santi (14,525) is given unanimously 
by all the three of our sources, which is a fortunate coincidence and also a 
remarkable prooif of the reliability of our tradition. The Vulgate figure 
(14,725) for the slokas is positively wrong. — ^There is a difference of only six 
between the Javanese and Indian figures for adhyayas^ the Indian tradition 
giving the figure as 339, the Javanese as 333. The agreement between the 
different Indian versions is a weighty point in favour of 339, which we may 
tentatively assume to be the correct figure. 

XIIL Amddsana : iThe evidence of the Javanese Version is unfortu- 
nately missing, the version ignoring this palrvan altogether, for some reason 
which it is hard to guess. It cannot be argued that it; is included in the 
Sinti, since there is no appreciable increase in the number of adhyayas or

suspicious,

EPIC QUESTIONS 


4lokaa of the Javanese Version of the Santi, as there would surely have been, 
had the two parvans been amalgamated as is done sometimes^ There 
being also no agreement between the various Indian versions, the figures for 
both adhyiaysLs and ^lokas of the Anu^sana remain uncertain. 

XIV. Asvamedhika : The number of adhydyas is unanimously given 
as 133, which may therefore be accepted as the correct figure. — ^There is a 
discrepancy as regards the number of slokas : the! Critical Edition gives the 
figure as 3320, while the Javanese and the {556} Southern Recension agree in 
giving the figure} asl 4420, this being one of the rare instances in which the 
Javanese and the Southern Recension agree against the Northern Recension. 
The Southern Recension contains here an additional sub-parvaln, comprising 
23 adhyayas and about 1700 Slokas, known as the Vaismavadharma parvan. 
There is no mention of any such parvan in the list of 100 pavans, given in 
the Pa!rvasamgraha, though some Southern MSS. do insert, in another place, 
a line which mentions the Vaistiavadharma among the contents of the Ai§va- 
medhika. In this Section, Yudhi§thira is instructed by iSr!-K|^a in the 
Dharma of the Vaisiriavas, which seems hardly necessary, after the instruc- 
tion he had received from Bha§ma in more than 21,000 stanzas on general 
Dharma (iS^ti and Anu^sana). The higher Southern number must there- 
fore be rega!rded as due to this inflation, and can in any case not be accepted. 
Nevertheless the peculiar agreement between the Javanese and the Southern 
is a disturbing factor. The number therefore may be regarded as doubtful. 

XV. Asrmuwdsika : There is not much doubt about the adhyayas of 
this parvan, though the Javanese Version has a high figure (92) i against the 
unanimous Indian figure 42, which may be assumed to be the correct figure.^ 
— ^As regards the number of slokas, there is a slight discrepancy of 2 between 
the Critical Edition and the Javanese Version, the former being 1506, the 
latter 1508. But the last digit in this number is not in doubt ; it must be 
six. The Southern Recension gives the figure 1906, which must be regarded 
as extremely doubtful, since even Professor Sastri, who has edited the 
Southern Recension, could not find more than 1108^ stanzas for this parvan.® 
There has been clearly a mistake in the countingl of the stanzas of this par- 

^ It is peihaps worth noticing that so late a commentator as Vadiraja (cf. 
P. K. Gone, ABORI, vol. 17, pp. 200^210, who assigns him to the seventeenth 
century), treats the Santi and Anu^sana as one parvan and has colophons like : 

—which ia quoted by Profeaaor P. S. Sastri in the Introduction to vrf. 17, 
(Anu^sana Parvan, part 2,) p. xxiv. 

2 Kern (lac, cit.) likewise suggests reading 42 for 92 of the Javanese. 

® It is interesting to note, as pointed out by Professor Sastri, Nannaya’s 
Andhra-Bhdratamu gives 1106 as the figure of slokas in the A4raiuav&$ika parvan, 
That probably is due to a fresh count, 



Ei>ic oufestiONS ii

van, and the Southern figure being palpably incorrect, we may utilize the 
approximate agreement between the Critical Editirm and the Javanese Ver- 
sion and adopt 1506 aa the probable original Parvasamgraha figure for the 
A^ramavasika. 

XVI. Mausala : All sources agree in giving the number of adhyayas 
aa 8 and the number of slokas aa 300, which may accordingly be taken as the 
correct figures. The text also seems to con-j;557}-tain; actually 300 stanzas. 
Consequently the vulgate reading 320, in the Parvasamgraha chapter, is 
clearly faulty and has been properly rejected. 

XVII. Mahaprasthdnika ; The Javanese figure for the number of 
adhyayas ia missing ; but the Indian sources, including the MSS., uniformly 
divide this short parvan into three adhyayals ; and the unanimous Indian 
reading cannot be called into question.— The number of slokas may also be 
regarded as correctly given in the Critical Edition, which is supported by the 
Southern Recension, though the Javanese Version adds, erroneously, three to 
the number, giving the figure as 123. I surmise that this addition of three to 
the 41oka number is a wrong tran^sition from the adhySya number, which 
is missing in 'die Javanese Version. The Vulgate figure (320) for the slokas 
is absurd and unquesticmably incorrect. 

XVIII,. SvatgoTohatia ; As in the previous case the adhyaya number 
is lost in the Javanese Version ; but there cannot be any doubt that the cor- 
rect figure is 5, which is given by all editions and MSS. of the Mahabharata. 
—The sloka number is unanimously given, by our three sources, as 200, which 
is a sufficiently correct approximation of the actual extent of this last parvan 
of the Great Epic ; and the Vulgate figure (209) may be unhesitatingly 
rejected. 

The table on the following page gives the figures for the adhyayas 
and slokas, book by book, arrived at by a collation of ’ the various extant 
versions of the Parvasarngraha chapter of the Adiparvah.
