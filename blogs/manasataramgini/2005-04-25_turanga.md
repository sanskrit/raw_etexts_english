svastrI had gone to check the original hall for its temperature and
reported that as she came out she saw tura\~NgA. My ugrakAmI tried to
ask tura\~NgA what she was doing there but she ran away. svastrI tried
to chase her but even the pumAn have never beaten tura\~NgA. The muni
knew this as me and the muni had one watched a long gone duShTa chase
tura\~NgA and failed. I was intensely agitated by the display of
tura\~NgA, but the young muni who had transcended the rasArNava was
unmoved. But svastrI was unusually alarmed of tura\~NgAâ€™s presence and
changed the venue. I started thinking of tura\~NgA and saw the two
shakunas. I was puzzled as when I noticed them first but I still do not
understand them. But we still march ahead- for they all these shakunas
are only for traders and not true warriors.
