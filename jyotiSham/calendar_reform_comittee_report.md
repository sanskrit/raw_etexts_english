### MESSAGE. 
I am glad that the Calendar Reform Committee has started its la bours. The Government of India has entrusted to it the work of examining the different calendars followed in this country and to submit proposals to the Government for an accurate and uniform calendar based on a scientific study for the whole of India. I am told that we have at present thirty different calendars, differing from each other in various ways, including the methods of time reckoning. These calendars are the natural result of our past political and cultural history . and partly represent past political divisions in the country. Now that we have attained independence, it is obviously desirable that there should be a certain uniformity in the calendar for our civic, social and other purposes and that this should be based on a scientific approach to this problem. 
It is true that for governmental and many other public purposes we follow the Gregorian calendar, which is used in the greater part of the world. The mere fact that it is largely used, makes * it important. It has many virtues, but even this has certain defects which make it unsatisfactory 
for universal use. 
सत्यमेव जयते It is always difficult to change a calendar to which people are used, because it affects social: practices. But the attempt has to be made even though it may not be as complete as desired. In any event, the present confusion in our own calendars, in India ought to be removed. 
I hope that our Scientists will give a lead in this matter.

### PREFACE 
The Calendar Reform Committee was appointed suggested by Dr. Hashim Amir Ali of the Osmania in November, 1952, by the Council of Scientific and University, and Janab Mohammed Ajmal Khan of the Industrial Research (of the Government of India) with Ministry of Education. It is for the Islamic world to the following terms of reference : give its verdict on these suggestions.

place to place. The Indian calendars put up by almanac-makers commit the violation of the following principles of science : 
They take the length of the year to be 365.258756 days (p. 240, Part C of Report) as given by the Saryam Siddhanta about 500 A. D. ; while the correct length of the tropical year, which alone can be used according to the Surya-Siddhanta and modern astronomy for calendarical use, is 365.242196 days. The difference of .01656 days is partly due to errors of observation, not infrequent in those days, and to their failure to recognize the precession of equinoxes. As the Sūrya Siddhanta value of the year-length is still used in almanac-making, the year-beginning is advancing by .01656 days per year, so that in the course of nearly 1400 years, the year-beginning has advanced by. 23.2 days, with the result that the Indian solar year, instead of starting on the day following the vernal equinox, i.e., on March 22, as prescribed in the Sarya Siddhanta (see Chap. V, p. 239), starts on April 13 or 14. The situation is the same as happened in Europe due to the acceptance of 365.25 days as the length of the year at the time of Julius Caesar ; the Christmas Áriginally linked to the winter solstice preceded it by 10 days by 1582 A.D., when the error was rectified by the promulgation of a bull by Pope Gregory XIII. By this, Friday, October 5 was proclaimed as Friday, October 15, and new leap-year rules were introduced. 
Unlike Europe, where the Pope in the medieval times possessed an authority which every one in i Catholic Europe respected, India had a multiplicity of eras and year-beginnings due to her history during the years 500-1200 A. D. But for calendaric calcula tions, our astronomers all over India have been using only the Saka era since Āryabhața (500 A.D.) certainly and probably from much earlier times, and in local almanacs other eras are simply imposed on it. The Calendar Committee has therefore recommended : 
That for all official purposes, the Central as well as State Governments should use the Saka era along with the civil calendar proposed by the Committee (p.6). It is suggested that the change-over may take place from the Saka year 1878, Caitra 1 (1956, March 21). If this is accepted, the last month of the year, viz., 1877 Saka, the solar Phalguna, which has a normal length of 30 days, will have an extra number of 6 or 
(scientific) astronomy evolved by Indian astronomers on the basis of old Indian calendaric conceptions, which were put on scientific basis by blending with them astronomical conceptions prevalent in the West, from the third century B.C. 
The era is also used exclusively for horoscope making, a practice introduced into India since the first century A.D. by the Sakadvipi Brahmanas. 
The Calendar Committee has devised a solar calendar with fixed lengths of months for all-India use, in which it has been proposed to give up the calculations of the Sarya-Siddhanta in which the solar months vary from 29 to 32 days, 
Religious Calendar-The Committee's task resolved itself into a critical examination of the different Indian local calendars, about 30. in number, which use different methods of calculation. This produces great confusion. 
As already stated the Sarya-Siddhanta year being longer than the tropical year by about 24 mins., the Hindu calendar months have gone out of the seasons to which they conformed when the Siddhantic rules were framed ; as a result, the religious festivals are being observed not in the seasons for which they were intended but in wrong seasons. The Committee felt that the error should be corrected once for all and the months brought back to their original seasons. But with a view to avoiding any violent break in the present day practices, the desired shifting has not been effected, but any further increase of the error has been stopped by adopting the tropical year for our religious calendar also (see p. 7). 
Before the rise of Siddhanta Jyotişa ( 400 A.D.), India used only the lunar calendar calculated according to the Vedānga Jyotişa rules and most religious festi vals ( e.g. the Janmaştami, the birthday of Sri Krşpa) used to be fixed up by the lunar calendar which used only tithi and nakşatra. The Calendar Committee could not find out any way of breaking off with the lunar affiliation short of a religious revolution and has, therefore, decided to keep them. For this purpose, the lunar year is to be pegged on to the solar year by a number of conventions. The Committee has adhered to the ancient conventions as far as possible. But the erroneous calculations of tithis and naksatras have been replaced by modern calculations given in the nautical almanacs and modern ephemerides, and the religious holidays have been fixed for a central station of India ( ride page 40 ). . The present practice is to calculate the tithi for each locality and the result is that the same tithi may not occur on the same day at all. places. The Calendar Committee has found that the continuance

## PART-A INTRODUCTORY 
In India there is at present a terrible calendar confusion. 

For official purposes, India has been using the Gregorian calendar since the imposition of the British rule in 1757. As the Gregorian calendar, on account of historic reasons, has attained the status of a World Calendar, it is still being used for official purposes after the attainment of Independence. There is a proposal sponsored by India before the UNO for the intro duction of a new World Calendar for civil and administrative purposes in place of the Gregorian calendar, which is inconvenient and unscientific (vide C $2.7). 

During the period of Moslem supremacy (1200-1757), the lunar Hejira calendar had been used. both for administrative as well as for Moslem religious purposes, except for a short period (1556-1630), when on the initiative of the Emperor Akbar, its use was prohibited and a form of the Iranian solar calendar (the Jelali calendar), under the name Tarikh Ilāhi, was intro duced. The Hejira calendar is now used only by the followers of Islam for fixing up the dates of their religious festivals. 

Before the advent of Moslem domination, the different states of India used a bewildering variety of calendars for civil as well as religious purposes of which a detailed account is given in C $5. The inscriptions of Indian kings from the first century A.D. to medieval times are dated according to these calendars, and it is often a headache for the Indologist to find out the starting point of the eras used in these calendars. 

Most of these calendars have gone out of use for civil purposes, but some are being still used for fixing up the dates and moments of religious festivals of communities following different. schools of Hinduism and other religions having their origin in India (Buddhism, Jainism). They use different eras, different year-beginnings, and sometimes different methods of calculations based on the three Siddhantas (scientific astronomical treatises), viz., the Sūrya, the ārya, and the Brahma, all dating from ancient and medieval times. 

These practices often produce a bewildering con fusion in fixing up dates and moments of observance of the religious festivals, of which some detailed examples are given later. The Calendar Reform Committee was asked to make a study of the various Hindu religious calendars, and recommend to the Government a Unified National Calendar for Hindu religious purposes for the whole of India. The Committee has now finished its labours, and presents its report to the Government. The main points are summarized below: 

The Hindu religious calendar is mainly luni-solar, i.e., the seasons are fixed by the solar calendar, while the dates and moments are fixed according to the lunar calendar pegged on to it. 

The calendar therefore depends on the science of astronomy which has evolved methods for correctly predicting the positions of the sun, the moon, and the planets (the Ephemerides). The astronomical part of the calculations should be the same for calendars used by all nations. But this is not the whole story ; for the calendar also depends on convention, which varies widely from country to country and from state to state. 

Let us give some idea of the Science as well as of the Conventions in use for the solar and the lunar calendars respectively. For the solar calendar : 

- (1) The year should be properly defined, and the year-length taken should be astronomically correct. 
- (2) The seasons should be properly defined, and should start on proper dates. 
- (3) The day should start from midnight. 

An examination of Chap. XIV of the Surya Siddhānta (vide C$ 5.6) shows that the author of this famous treatise accepted these principles and laid down the following rules for the compilation of a calendar : 

- (1) The year should start from the instant when the sun crosses the vernal equinoctial point and the length of the year should therefore be tropical (sāyana). 
- (2) The seasons should consist of two solar months, each defined by the time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of the sun's path (the ecliptic). 
- (3) The day should be from midnight (ardharātråka system) for purposes of astronomical calculations. 

These principles do not alone suffice to define the calendar, for the year does not consist of a whole number of days, but its length (length of the tropical year) is approximately 365.2422 mean solar days. The time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of the arc of the ecliptic varies from 29.44 days to 31.46 days. 
 
The Calendar Committee has tried to rectify this fundamental error, by recommending, as laid down by the Sūrya Siddhānta, that the year should begin on the day after the vernal equinox, and the year-length should be sāyana. 

For civil purposes, both the year and the month should consist of a whole number of days, and the civil day ( sāvana ), according to Hindu religious practices, should start from sunrise. To achieve these purposes, different conventions have been used in different states which account partly for calendar confusion ( vide C 85:6). 

But the most serious mistake has been in the length of the year taken by the Sūrya Siddhānta, a standard astronomical compilation having its beginning from the 4th century A.D. The year-length adopted is 365.25876 days, which is presumably sidereal, but even then the length is wrong by + 0.00240 days. But as is pointed out in C $ 56, the Sarya Siddhanta lays down definitely that the year-length should be tropical which, according to modern measurements, should have approximately 365.2422 days, but this rule has been misinterpreted. 

The mistakes in astronomical constants (e.g., in the fixing up of the length of the year or months) are common in all ancient astronomical treatises, whether Indian or occidental, but in the West, the correct values were obtained later by refined observations during medieval times and were then adopted for calendar calculations by edicts of dictators like Julius Caesar or Pope Gregory XIII on the advice of astronomers. In India, astronomical observations stopped from about 1200 A.D. after the advent of the Turkish invaders, when Indian observatories were either destroyed or abandoned by the astronomers and calendar making fell into the hands of astrologers, who had to depend on ancient treatises. 

But a far more potent cause for the adherence to the wrong value was the failure, on the part of the Indian astronomers, to grasp the real nature of the phenomenon of Precession of Equinoxes (vide C $ 4:10). In this, they were not alone, for the false notions about this phenomenon were not abandoned even in Europe till the advent of Newton (1687). 

The Indian year is thus longer than the tropical year by 0.01656 days, and this error has been accumulating for nearly 1400 years with the result that the solar year, instead of starting on the day following the vernal equinox (21st March) as it did in the time of Varahamihira starts nearly 23-24 days later. Thus the year beginning as laid down by our almanac-makers has lost all connection with the actual year-beginning (the day following the vernal equinoctial day) as contemplated by the Sūrya Siddhanta, and the festivals as given by the Indian almanacs are being celebrated very frequently in wrong seasons. If Sarat Pūrimā is celebrated in the Hemanta season, as would happen in the year 1955, it is obvious that our almanacs are following neither the Scriptures nor Science. 
LENGTHS OF THE SOLAR MONTHS : 
The Hindu solar month-lengths vary from 29 to 32, as the time of passing 30° of the ecliptic varies, accord ing to older data given in the Sarya Siddhanta from 29.32 days to 31.64 days. These varying lengths, as is well-known, can be understood only from Kepler's first two laws, which were explained fully by Newton in 1687 on the basis of dynamics and law of universal gravitation, but these laws and their explanation were unknown to astronomers in 400 A.D. Further these month-lengths are different in the three Siddhāntas be cause they were calculated according to three different formulæ. On account of the ignorance of Kepler's laws. and of the shift of the equinoctial lines in the Earth's orbit ( vide C $ 5:6) the ancient astronomers probably assumed that the times of passage through 30° as calculated according to formulæ given by them would be valid for all times. But we now know this assumption to be incorrect, and cannot stick to the lengths as given in the Siddhantas, which also differ amongst themselves. 
Further, all the numbers expressing month-lengths are fractional, and different states, vix., Bengal, Orissa, Tamil Nad use different conventions for defining the day of the solar samkrānti ( vide C $ 5:6) i.e., the civil day (sunrise to sunrise) which should be regarded as the day when the sun passes successive 30° of arc, beginning from the Hindu zero-point. The different conventions have their own merits, let the orthodox Bengalee, Oriya, or Tamil Pandit argue it out amongst themselves, but we feel that a convention which makes the solar month vary from 29 to 32 is very inconve nient for civil life, and we are quite sure that if the authors of the Siddhāntas were aware of Kepler's Laws and the shifting of equinoctial lines on the Earth's orbit, they would never have prescribed rules which would make the number of days in a solar month vary from 29 to 32. We have, therefore, assigned lengths of 30 and 31 days to the months. But the moment of the sun's traversing any multiple of the 30th degree from the vernal equinoctial point has been indicated. . We have recommended the SAKA era, as this is the era par excellence used by all Indian astronomers, and had been used and is still used for calendaric calculations all over India, since the days of the Ujjain astronomers (first century A.D.). This is the only era used in all Indian scientific treatises. For other eras see C $ 5.8. 
 
Date 
The new solar calendar is scientific, applicable to all parts of India, and follows the Sūrya Siddhānta in all essential points, and is absolutely sound as regards its astronomical basis. The conventions have been revised with the sole object of having a uniform system for the whole of India.

The lunar calendar depends on the correct calcula tion of the moments of conjunction (Amāvasyā), oppo sition (Paurnamāsi) and of the tithis (c.e., the moments when the moon gains 12° or its integral multiple on the sun). The Indian calendar-makers use for this purpose the formulæ on lunar motion given in the three Siddhāntas. But as these are known to be inac curate, they use certain corrections called bīja intro duced by later Indian astronomers. 
It is now well-known that the motion of the moon is very irregular and complex, and therefore the moon is very inconvenient as a time-marker. For this reason the moon was completely discarded by the Egyptians as a time-marker 3000 years before Christ. The an cient Egyptian solar calendar is the basis from which the present Gregorian calendar has sprung. 
But other ancient and modern nations did not follow the Egyptians, and it became the chief duty on the part of their astronomers to observe the moon from day to day, and evolve mathematical formula from which the ephemerides of the moon could be calculated. As Neugebauer has shown (Exact Sciences in Antiquity), ancient Babylonian astronomy (700 B.C. 300 B.C.) was largely centred round devising, , from actual observations of the moon's position, mathemati cal formulæ, which would enable them to calculate the longitude of the moon in advance. These attempts were continued by the Greeks, Indians, Arabs and medieval Europeans and are still being continued. For the calculation of the moon's position, formulæ are employed which require' twenty pages of printed matter, containing about 1,500 terms in all. They have been evolved as measurements have become more refined and accurate, with the progress of astronomy ; and were, of course, unknown to astronomers of ancient times. 
Some of the Indian calendar-makers are aware of these discrepancies, and give the ending moments of tithis according to the Nautical Almanac. But all of them give the moments of beginning and ending of lunar and solar eclipses according to the Nautical Almanac, as times calculated according to the Siddhantas may be grossly inaccurate, and the mistakes would at once catch public attention and lower their prestige. In the words of one of our colleagues (Dr. Gorakh Prasad), these almanac-makers are like bicycle-riders riding without lamps, who get down from their cycles on street corners, just to avoid being caught by the Police. 
The calculations of tithis given by the Calendar Committee follow the Nautical Almanac, and are based on correct positions of the moon and the sun. 
The Committee has made another radical departure. According to conventions laid down in Dharmaśāstras, a religious festival is to be observed in a locality when the prescribed tithi is current at a particular hour of the civil day of that locality. But on the same day and hour, the tithi may vary from locality to locality and this, taken with the mistakes in calculating tithi according to ancient methods, may produce a day's difference in fixing up the dates of religious festivals. . If the different almanac-makers calculate the tithi not according to the Nautical Almanac, but according to different Indian astronomical treatises, the moment of the tithi may differ by as much as five hours, and the same festival, say the Dussera (or Durga Pujā) may be fixed on two successive days in the same city, as happend in Calcutta in the case of Durga Pujā in 1952 and Sarasvati Puja in 1953. Which set of Pandits is to be followed by the Government in fixing up the date of holidays in such cases ? 
The Committee has taken the view that the ending moments of tithis should be given according to modern 
calculations(which would naturally agree with Nautical . Almanacs) and the tithi current for the Central Station ( 821° E. Long. and 23° 11' N. Lat.) should be the tithi for the whole of India. This is a very 
Effect of Indian Lunar Calendars : : 
As the orthodox Indian calendar-maker still uses the old formulæ dating from 400 A.D., his calcula 'tions of the ending moments of tithis do not agree with those given by the Nautical Almanacs, which are based on modern formulæ and are verified by actual observations as shown in the following example: 
 
sensible proposition, for if we have to follow the '. Siddhāntic convention to the letter, then even if the calculations are given correctly, every station would have its own tithi, just as according to Relativity, every moving particle has its own time. But the Pandits are not correct in their own claims that they are following the Sāstras correctly ; for a Banaras almanac is according to Siddhāntic convention, true only for Banaras, but may on certain occasions, be incorrect for a place even a mile from Banaras. So the Siddhāntic convention was laid down in an age when there was no printing presses and no printed almanacs, but almanacs were to be fixed up and recited for every locality by local astrologers according to their own calculations. If it has still to be followed, every village should print its own almanac. In laying down the principle that the whole of India should follow the tithi calculated for a central locality, we are no more violating the Siddhāntic convention than the calculators of the Banaras or Calcutta almanacs which have currency over wide areas far away from their own city. 
In course of fixing the festivals of different states in the Reformed Calendar, it has been found that different conventions are followed in different states in the matter of fixation of the same festival. For example it may be quoted that in 1954 Janmāştami was observed on the 21st August in North India and on the 20th, 21st and 22nd in other parts of India. Rāmanavami was observed in Bengal on 24th March, 1953, while it was celebrated on the preceding day in upper India. The calculation of the ending moment of tithi is not the cause for such discrepancies in this case, but the difference in convention is solely responsible. We have followed all these differences of conventions in the state-wise fixation of the dates of festivals, as far as practicable. We are however of opinion that a uniform convention should be followed throughout India in this matter also. In order to explore the possibilities of such unification, it is desirable that necessary steps should be taken by the Government. The Ephemerides Committee which we have recommended may be entrusted with this work. 
APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMITTEE 
The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research appointed in November 1952, a Calendar Reform Committee with:Prof. M.N. Saha, F.R.S., as Chairman and six other members (vide their letter No. 144 Bd. (G. P.)/52 dated the 11th November, 1952, intimating the decision of the Governing Body meeting held on 13. 8. 52) as follows:

[N. B. Numbers 6 and 7 were appointed in place of Prof. S. N. Bose and Dr. Akbar Ali, who were originally appointed by the Governing Body, but regretted their inability to serve, vide C.S.I.R. letter No.144 Bd. (G. R.)/52, dated the 21st January, 1953). 
The terms of referencë are as follows :-. 
The Committee has been entrusted with the task of "examining all the existing calendars which are being followed in the country at present and after a scientific study of the subject, submit proposals for an accurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India." 
COMMITTEE MEETINGS The Committee had three meetings and have now finalized their recommendations to Government. 
1. The first meeting was held at 10 A.M. on Saturday, the 21st February, 1953, in the C.S.I.R. Secretariat Buildings, Old Mill Road, New Delhi, and it continued also on the 23rd February. The Prime Minister sent a message and Shri K. D. Malaviya Deputy Minister, Natural Resources and Scientific Research, inaugurated the meeting. The proceedings of the meeting will be found in Annexure I. 
After discussion on the several points mentioned by the Chairman, the Committee arrived at certain decisions and adopted the following resolutions : 
(1) The tropical year of 365.2422 days should be adopted for the purpose of calendar making. 
(2) A scientific civil solar calendar to be hence forth called the National Calendar for purposes of dating should have its first day after the vernal equinox day, i.e., on the 22nd March. But for reli gious purposes the calculations may start 23° 15' ahead. of the V. E. point, for sometime to come ( as a conces sion to the prevailing custom ). 
(3) The Saka era should be adopted for the reformed Indian Calendar. 
(4) All calculations should be made for a central station in India situated at 823° East Longitude and 23° 11' North Latitude (latitude of Ujjain). 
 
respect to the stars ; otherwise the nakşatra divisions would lose all connections with the stars or star-groups contained in those nakşatras. For this purpose, the ayanamsa of 23° 15' should relate to 21st March, 1956, the middle of the five yearly period. 
The calculations of the Reformed Calendar for five years, have been revised in the light of the above decisions. 
III. The third and the final meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee was held on the 13th September, 1954, at 100 A.M. in the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi. In this meeting, the Reformed Calendar for five years, the resolutions so far adopted and the final report were approved for submission. The proceedings will be found as Annexure III. 
(5) The day should be reckoned from midnight to midnight of the central station for civil purposes, but for religious purposes the local sunrise system may be followed. 
The Committee made the following recommenda tions to the Government of India : 
(i) A tentative national calendar for the whole of India should be prepared for five years in advance, showing dates, days, months, tithi's (lunar days) and naksatras (lunar asterisms). 
(ii) Steps should be taken to compile an Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac by the Government of India showing in advance positions of the sun, the moon, planets and other important heavenly bodies.. 
(iii) There should be a National Observatory at a suitable place provided with modern equipments, apparatus and time-service. 
The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research accepted the first recommendation and appointed Shri N. C. Lahiri and Prof. R. V. Vaidya, members of the Committee, as whole-time workers for the purpose of implementation of this recommendation, and also provided them with necessary assistants. The experi mental National Calendar of India for the five years 1954-55 to 1958-59 A.D. (Saka 1876 to 1880) has accord ingly been prepared and will be found as Part B. 
II. The second meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee was held on the 8th March, 1954, at 10 A.M. in the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi, In this meeting the detailed methods of preparation of the Reformed Calendar were discussed and certain resolutions were adopted which will be found in the proceedings of the meeting given in Annexure II. The question of adopting variable ayanānsa was discussed, but no final decision could be taken in the meeting. The Chairman decided the question later after taking opinion of members by correspondence. The following are the principal points decided : 
(1) Caitra (pronounced as Chaitra) should be the first solar month of the year starting on the day following vernal equinox, and the names of the solar months should be Caitra, Vaišākha, etc. 
(2) The lengths of the civil solar months be fixed as follows: 
EXAMINATION OF THE EXISTING CALENDARS 
With a view to examining the existing calendars, as per terms of reference, all the Pañcanga makers in different states of India were requested by a Press communique' issued by the C.S.I.R. in March 1953, to send 3 copies of their Pañcăngas covering the year 1953-54. As a result of this request many calendars were received from different parts of India, a list of which is given as Annexure V. Some difficulty was experienced in studying the exact nature of these calendars due to language difficulty and want of the required data in these calendars. Accordingly a questionnaire was issued in November 1953, to all these and also to some other calendar makers whose addresses were known, requesting them to furnish certain data relating to their calendars. The questionnaire together with the replies so far received will be found as Annexure VI. 
SUGGESTIONS RECEIVED FOR CALENDAR REFORM 
We have received various suggestions for calendar reform from different persons. A summary of these suggestions will be found in Annexure VII. All the suggestions have been examined in the Committee meetings before finalization of the recommendations of the Committee. Some of the suggestions favour the continuance of the present inaccurate system of calendar making. But on the other hand there are many persons and organizations who have suggested that accurate and scientific calendar, as recommended by the Committee should be adopted. 
Caitra~ 30 & 31 days (31 days in a leap-year), Vaisakha-31, Jyaiştha-31, Aşadha-31 Śrāvana–31, Bhadra-31, Ăśvina--30, Kartika-30, Agrahāyana--30, Parışa-30, Magha-30, and Phalguna-30 days. Leap years should correspond with the leap-years 
of the Gregorian calendar. 
(3) The nakşatras should be calculated with a variable ayanāmša, so that they remain fixed with 
HOLIDAYS We have prepared tables ( vide B) giving dates of various religious festivals and holidays observed in different states of India in four categories,

viz., solar, luni-solar, Christian and Moslem. Many festivals and holidays are common in all states, others are different. A festival which is considered very important in one state (e.g., Dussera or Durga Pujā in Bengal ) may be considered secondary in other regions (e.g., in Western India). There are holidays confined only to certain states. It is hoped that the Central Government may make choice of such holidays which should be considered as Central, for obviously they cannot accept all holidays current in India, as there would then be few working days left. 
On account of shortness of time, it has not been found possible to give planetary data except the heliacal rising and setting of Jupiter and Venus. These 
are not necessary for calculation of the dates and moments of religious festivals, except in a few rare cases like the Kumbha Mela. The Ephemerides Committee, if it comes into existence, may be entrusted with this work. 
In the compilation of the Reformed Indian Calendar, we have received invaluable help from Sir Harold Spencer Jones, Astronomer Royal of the United Kingdom, who provided us with certain advance data facilitating our calculations. The grateful thanks of the Committee are due to him. We also wish to thank our correspondents, many of whom helped us with valuable data and information. 
FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE 
31 
» 
The calendar has got two distinct uses, viz., civil and religious. The Indian calendars, in the particular form it has assumed in different parts of the country, are used for the purpose of dating not only by the rural, but also by a large section of the urban popula tion. On account of the fact, as mentioned above, that the usage of one area differs from another, the Committee recommends that the unified National Calendar should be used uniformly in all states of India, for civil purposes wherever necessary, in place of local calendars.

The Indian seasons would thus be permanently fixed with respect to the reformed calendar, as follows :

Phalguna & Caitra 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CIVIL CALENDAR (1) The Saka era should be used in the unified national calendar. The year 1954-55 A.D. corresponds to 1876 Saka or in other words the year 1954 A.D. corresponds to 1875-76 Saka. 
(2) The year should start from the day following the vernal equinox day. 
(3) A normal year would consist of 365 days while a leap-year would have 366 days. After adding 78 to the Saka era, if the sum is divisible by 4, then it is a leap-year. But when the sum becomes a multiple of 100, it would be a leap-year only when it is. divisible by 400, otherwise it would be a common year. 
The years Śaka 1878, 1882, 1886, 1890, 1894 etc., are leap-years consisting of 366 days each. But the gears 2022, 2122, 2222 and again 2422, 2522, 2622 Saka are not leap-years, while 1922, 2322, 2722 Saka are leap-years. 
(4) Castra ( pronounced as Chaitra ) should be the first month of the year, and the lengths of the different months would be fixed as follows: 
Caitra 30 days (31 days in a leap-year ) Vaisakha 31 days Jyaiştha 31 * Āsādha 
Home Pro 
31 » 
 
In course of implementation of these recommenda tions, the states now having the solar calendar for civil and partly religious purposes which start the year from Vaisakha 1 ( April 14 ), will have to begin the year 23 days earlier, but the first month will be Cailra. The effect of this on the states are as follows: 
(6) As usual the lunar months for religious pur poses would commence from the moment of new-moon and would be named after the saura māsa in which the new-moon falls. If there be two new-moons during the period of a saura māsa, the lunar month beginning from the first new-moon is the adhika or mala and the lunar month beginning from the moment of the second new-moon is the suddha or nija, as usual. 
Bengal, Orissa, 
& Assam : 
Solar months start approximately seven days later than now, 
Tamil Nad : Solar months start approximately 
23 days earlier than now, for the month called Vaisakha (14th April-14th May) in Bengal and Orissa is called Chittirai or Caitra in Tamil Nad. 
Those who use the Caitrādi lunar calendar also for civil purposes, would however experience no great difficulty in adopting this unified calendar, as they have at present the beginning of their year varying from 15th March to 13th April, and the first month is Caitra. 
(7) The moments of moon's exit from a nakşatra division of 13° 20' each or sun's entry into it, would be calculated with a variable ayanāmsa j.e., on the supposition that they are fixed with respect to the stars. The value of this ayanāinsa would amount to 23° 15' 0" on 21st March, 1956. Thereafter it would gradually increase with the usual annual rate, the mean value of which is about 50".27. 
These arrangements would ensure that the religious festivals, and observances determined by the sun (such as the Mahävişuva samkrānti, Uttarāyaṇa samkrānti, Dakşināyana samkrānti) would follow astronomically correct seasons, but those determined by the lunar calendar would continue to be observed in times conforming to the present practice, and the correction we have introduced in the length of the year would prevent their further shift in relation to the seasons. 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RELIGIOUS CALENDAR 
(5) The calculation of solar ( saura ) months necessary for determining the lunar months of the same name, will start 23° 15' ahead of the vernal equinoctial point. This tallies with the present practice of most almanac-makers. 
: The months would thus commence at the moments when the tropical longitude of the sun attains the following values : 
The dates of festivals have already shifted by 23 days from the seasons in which they were observed about 1400 years ago as a result of our almanac-makers having ignored the precession of the equinoxes. Although it may seem desirable that the entire amount of shifting should be wiped out at a time, we consider it expedient to maintain this as a constant difference and stop its further increase. As a result, there would at present be no deviation from the prevailing custom in the observance of the religious festivals. 
In the calculation of nakşatras, however, we have adopted a variable ayanāmsa, so, that at the time of a particular nakşatra the moon may be seen in the sky near the star or star-group of that name. This practice is being followed in our country from the Vedic times and is perfectly scientific.

But it does not make our present seasons in the various months as they were in the days of Varahamihira or Kalidasa. It is hoped that at not a distant date, further reforms for locating the lunar and solar festivals in the seasons in which they were originally observed will be adopted. 
(8) The day should be reckoned from midnight to midnight of the central station (821° E. Long. and 23° 11' North Latitude) for civil purposes, but for religious purposes the local sunrise system may be followed. 
(9) For the purpose of all calculations, the longi tudes of the sun and the moon should be obtained by applying the most up to date and complete equations of their motions, so that they may tally with their observed values.

FURTHER RECOMMENDATIONS 
(10) Steps should be taken to compile an "Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac" by the Government of India, showing in advance, the positions of the sun, the moon, planets and other heavenly bodies. The Indian calendar-both civil and religious prepared according to the above recommendations should be included in that publication every year, 
to be the most suitable time for introduction of the reformed calendar throughout India.

Dissenting note to the report of the Committee by Dr. K. L. Daftari. 
A permanent Standing Committee to be called the Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac Committee may be constituted for this purpose and attached to a scientific department of the Government of India. 
(11) Steps should be taken to establish a Natio nal Astronomical Observatory at a suitable place, provided with modern equipment, apparatus and time-service. 
I agree with the final report of the Committee dissenting only on the following point. I hold that the fixed nakşatras, though regarded as enjoined by the dharmaśāstras should not be taken into considera tion in fixing days of the religious functions, or the dharmaśāstras be regarded as enjoining the moving nakşatras starting from a point 23° 15' ahead of the equinoctial point. I have given my reasons previously in my letters to the Chairman of the Committee, (a summary of which will be found as Annexure IV). 
We hope that the Government of India would make early arrangements for implementation of our recommendations. For this purpose the date 21st March, 1956 A.D., which is Caitra 1, 1878 Saka seems

CALENDAR REFORM COMMITTEE 
The first meeting of the Indian Calendar Reform 4. Shri K. D. Malaviya, Deputy Minister, Natural Committee, C.S.I.R., was held at 10 A.M. on Saturday, Resources and Scientific Research, Government of the 21st February, 1953, in the C.S.I.R. Secretariat India, inaugurated the first meeting of the Calendar Buildings, Old Mill Road, New Delhi. The meeting Reform Committee. Shri Malaviya said :-- continued also on the 23rd February, 1953. 
"It is my very pleasant duty to extend to the Members The following were present :

I am told that we have at It is rather strange to find that while most of present thirty different calendars, differing from each other Christendom, in spite of diversity of race and country, in various ways, including the methods of time reckoning. follows one single calendar which has become the world These calendars are the natural result of our past political calendar, while all the Islamic countries follow also a single and cultural history and partly represent past political calendar, the different States and provinces of India have divisions in the country. Now that we have attained followed and are following not less than 30 different independence, it is obviously desirable that there should be calendars differing in the era beginning, the initial date of a certain uniformity in the calendar for our civic, social the year, and to some extent in the methods of calculation. and other purposes and that this should be based on a Though these calendars are used for social purposes, and scientific approach to this problem.

exact observations of the sun, the moon and other heavenly bodies, which serve as time-keepers: 
Up to 1200 A.D., before India passed under foreign invaders, our astronomers at Ujjain and other centres, always took the trouble of correcting their calculations from direct observations of the heavenly bodies. But, after 1200 A.D., the indigonous centres of astronomical study were all broken up, and the new rulers did not take the trouble of setting up fresh centres till towards the end of the Moghul rule, when Maharja Jai Singh of Amber established five observatorios at Ujjain, Jaipur and other centres for astronomical studies after the pattern of the famous obser vatory of Ulugh Begh at Samarkand. Our calendar-makers, being for long left to their own resources, and having no astronomical observatories had to fall back for calculations on rules which were insufficient and incorrect and which vitiated all the results. Therefore, confusion crept in the calendars, and they have become diversified according to local usage and customs. This condition is representative of 800 years of suppression, and is symbolic of the history of India. 
Now that we are an independent nation and are making all efforts to bring about integration in our national life, it is obvious that an important item like the calendar cannot be left in the present confused state. We use for civil and administrative purposes the Gregorian Calendar which has been imposed by the British Rulers. This calendar is not their invention but like the Roman script, it was imposed on them by their Roman civilisers who got it partly from Egypt. On account of the dominance of the Christian powers during the last two centuries, it has become the World Calendar. But on principle it is a very inconvenient and unscientific calendar compared to ours, and needs reform. 
There is a proposal before the U.N.O. by the World Calendar Association for the revision of the Gregorian calendar. One of the tasks of the present Committee would be to make suggestions to this world-body for the evolution of a world calendar which will be scientific and can command the consent of all nations. Our Moham medan fellow citizens will continue to use the Hedjira calendar for fixing their religious holidays and we leave them there. The la bours of the present Calendar Committee is to make a scientific study of all the calendars of indigenous origin, and make suggestions for a unified calendar for the guidance of administration, for social purposes, and as far as practicable, for fixing up the religious holidays for India. I am assured by my astronomical friends assembled here that this is quite possible. We shall be looking forward to your evolving a formula which would be acceptable to the different people and States of India, and the Government of India will give serious considerations to the adoption of your proposals. I need hardly add that this should be based on science, should take due consideration of the customs and religious festivals in different parts of the country and at the same time would be a calendar which the different communities and States can adopt. 
While making those suggestions before you I am aware of the difficulties. Calendar reform can be suggested by scientists, but it can be carried into practice only by those who have religious or political authority. The ancient Roinan calendar could be reformed only by a dictator like Julius Caesar, and later on by the religious dictator of Christendom, Pope Gregory XIII, and the ancient luni-solar calondar only by the authority of the Prophet. But we are now under a democracy. Whatever proposals you may make would have to be submitted to the public for their opinion, and I am quite sure that our public would not resent any innovation simply because it is a new thing, just as they do not reject electricity or new machines. I hope the public response would be encouraging and the Government would find it possible to give serious consideration to your proposals." 
5. Prof. M. N. Saha, the Chairman, on behalf of the members of the Committee, expressed grateful thanks to the Prime Minister for his kind message. The Committee regretted that the Prime Minister could not personally inaugurate the deliberations of the Committee. Prof. Saha, however, assured the Committee that the Prime Minister had his heart and soul in the matter, and that he wanted the Committee to get on with its work and evolve scientific proposals for preparation of a uniform calendar for the whole of India and for the benefit of the country. 
6. The Chairman on behalf of the Committee, gratefully thanked the Deputy Minister for having graced the occasion by his presence and having inaugurated the work of the Committee. The Deputy Minister had laid down the lines on which the Committee may proceed. With the encouragement of the Government, the Committee hoped to be able to accomplish the desired objective, for without State support the discussions would be dead letter. 
7. The Chairman pointed out that in India there were 30 or more different calendars. In Banaras alone they had four calendars and it was quite common that important Hindu festivals like Ganesa Caturthi and Sarasvati Pujā were celebrated on different days in different parts of the country or even at the same city as happened this year at Calcutta. The Committee should aim at placing before the Government proposals for a uniform scientific calendar which would be acceptable to all. The task was not an easy matter. 
8. Tracing out the history of the movement for calendar reform, the Chairman said that the idea was not a new one. The Indian luni-solar calendar up to 400 A.D. was very crude, but great astronomers of India after 400 A.D. in Pataliputra, Bhilmal in Rajasthan and in Ujjain particularly had made very great contributions to mathematical knowledge, to astronomy and to other branches of science. They 
 
laid down the formulæ for the future generations and advised them to get their calculations verified by means of observations of the sun, the moon and the planets, which are our time-makers. 
13. The great pioneer of calendar-studies was Sankara Balakrishna Dixit, whose history of Bharatiya Jyotişa-Sastra is a standard authoritative work, but his work is in Marathi and unaccessible to majority of India. The Chairman expressed the hope that it should be translated into English for the use of all.* 
9. At the present moment, the Ahargana or the heap of days is in usage for accurate chronological calculations. The idea was first evolved by Hindu astronomers about 400 A.D. This was invented only in the 16th century in Europe by Joseph Scaliger. The Siddhantic astronomers started the year from the day after the Vernal Equinox but the older tradition was, as many Indian savants had pointed out, to begin the calendar from Winter Solstice. 
14. In Bengal, Madhab Chandra Chattopadhaya had been publishing the Visuddha Siddhānta Panjikā since 1890, in which all calculations were made according to modern accepted formulæ. Shri Nirmal Chandra Lahiri, a member of the Committee, has been continuing the work. 
10. Solar months which were invented about these times had not proved very convenient for use. The month-lengths varied from 29 to 32. The greatest difficulty has been caused by the use of the sidereal year and not the year of seasons, as the Hindu savants of those times either were unaware of the existence of the phenomenon of precession of equinoxes, or thought it was not unidirectional. The mistake was found by Munjāla and Sripats in the 10th and 11th centuries, when the Vernal Equinox had receded by seven to eight days, and they tried to persuade the astronomers to take to sāyana reckoning but the attempt was unsuccessful. The situation now is that the Vernal Equinox falls on 21st March but our year beginning which ought to fall on the following day, falls, actually on 13th or 14th April. Thus a mistake of 23 days had occurred in our calculation of seasons, or year-beginning. 
15. The problem of Indian Calendar Reform was also seriously examined at Banaras, the ancient seat of Indian culture and religion by the late Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, Shri Sampurnanand and others and the need for rectification of the present position was impressed upon. 
16. Thus, the idea of calendar reform had been going on for a long time in this country on a personal level. But as it affected all classes of people, effective reform can be carried out only on State level. But all were agreed that there should be a uniform national calendar for the whole of India. 
17. All our religious festivals are determined according to the lunar calendar which is pegged on to the present unsatisfactory solar calendar. Hence the task before the Committee is to devise a satisfactory solar calendar first and peg on to it a lunar calendar. 
11. The Chairman pointed out that it was for the Committee to discuss and decide whether the year was to be brought back by 23 days or to leave the mistake as it was and to retain a permanent constanterror. He also pointed out that such a mistake had occurred in Europe and corrections had to be introduced. The Gregorian year in 1582 was found to have an error of 10 days. Pope Gregory XIII advised that the 5th October should be called the 15th October. This was adopted by the Catholics. Though the Protestant countries at first did not accept this move, simply because it came from the Pope, but 170 years later England had to accept the correction by legislation. Russia accepted the Gregorian calendar only after the Bolshevik resolution. 
18. The Chairman pointed out that there was a good deal of dissatisfaction even with the Gregorian calendar, though it has attained the status of a world calendar. One of the main drawbacks of this calendar is that the ending of the year does not correspond with the winter solstice day. There are several proposals for reforming the Gregorian calendar. According to one proposal, every month was to be of 4 weeks, and therefore of 28 days and thirteen months would make a year of 364 days. One day, the year-end day, was to be without any name and named simply the year-end day. In leap years, there was to be an additional year-raiddle day, without any weekday name. Every month was to begin on a Sunday. According to the other proposal the year was to consist of 4 quarters, each of 91 days. Each quarter was to be divided into three months of 31, 30, 30 days. The year-end day, and the year-middle day in leap years were to be the same as before. 
12. In India, the idea of Indian Calendar reform originated from Maharashtra Lokamanya Shri Bal Gangadhar Tilak well-known as a great political figure of the last generation was, as is well-known, a great savant and antiquarian and initiated calendar reform in Maharashtra. He started a new reformed calendar which is still being published at Poona. 
* The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research has since made arrangements for having the book translated into English and Prof. R. V. Vaidya, a member of the Committee has been entrusted with the work. 
12 
 
19. The World Calendar Association of New York, U.S.A., had a proposal before the United Nations Organization to evolve a uniform calendar for the whole world. Sir Harold Spencer Jones, the Astro nomer-Royal of U.K. and other eminent astronomers had expressed their support of the proposals of W.C.A.. They wanted to effect this change from 1956. This. proposal, if accepted, would produce great convenience and simplicity but succession of day reckoning by. the cycle of the seven day week will have to be given up. 
20. The Committee had to discuss all these matters, and its function was to submit proposals to the Govern ment of India and devise ways and means of achieving the desired scientific calendar. The Chairman said that the Committee could count upon the sympathy of the Hon'ble the Prime Minister and the Deputy Minister and of the Government of India. The proposals to be discussed are :-- 
(a) Whether a number of astronomical com 
puters would have to be appointed for compiling an All-India Calendar for five years in advance on the lines which will be suggested by the Committee. Whether steps should be taken to compile an Indian Ephemeris for the use of the calendar-makers, the Navy and the Air 
Force. (c) Establishment of a Central Astronomical 
Observatory by the Government equipped 
with modern instruments and apparatus. 21. The Chairman said that modern apparatus like the ammonia clock, the quartz clock should be installed in the observatory for the betterment of the time-service and for geophysical studies. 
22. The Chairman said that geophysical studies with the aid of accurate clocks was of very great fundamental importance. All along scientists had studied only the surface of the earth. But now the study of the interior of the earth has attained great significance and with the aid of accurate clocks, it has been found that the period of rotation of the earth undergoes sudden variations which may be due to something going on inside the earth. 
23. The Chairman emphasized that a reformed calendar and an Indian Ephemeris will be of advantage not only for civil, social and national life but will also be of great use for the army, the navy and the air force. He thanked the Hon'ble Deputy Minister on behalf of the Committee. (At this stage the Deputy Minister left the meeting.) 
24. The Chairman informed the Committee that he had received a number of good wishes for the deliberations of the Committee from not only India but also from several European countries as well as from Brazil, Canada, etc. The President of the W.C.A. Miss Achelis, had also sent her goodwill message. 
25. The general question as to whether or not Government of India should undertake reform of the various Hindu calendars in India and have one uniform calendar for the whole of India was discussed. 
Dr. Gorakh Prasad said that it will be in the fitness of things for the Government to initiate the reform and pointed out that only minimum necessary changes in the prevailing custom should be effected to avoid public resentment and opposition. He emphasized this point. He also pointed out that in the past there had been hero worship and guru-worship and due to personal animosity and financial considerations several anomalies have crept in. Even today pancānga making was a financial proposition. Astrology flourished on the principle “Remember it if it fits and forget it if it misses." 
Shri Lahiri said that proposals concerning religious festivals should be got ratified by eminent Pandits. 
Prof. Vaidya said that as we have got a democracy, Government of the people and by the people, Government should undertake the reform. 
Dr. Daftari pointed out, however, that the Committee had been definitely assigned the task of submitting proposals to the Government for a reform in the calendar and as such the general question whether the Government should undertake it or not did not arise. He laid emphasis on the fact that our present calendars were absurd in the sense that the seasons were moving backward and wanted that this should be stopped. 
The Committee resolved that a National Solar Calendar for civil purposes should be prepared by the Committee under the auspices of the Central Government and that the lunar pancānga should be pegged on to this calendar. 
26. Whether India should support the proposals of the W.Ç.A. was discussed. 
. Dr. Gorakh Prasad was not in favoar. Shri Karandikar opined that India should evolve a National Calendar and the whole world may follow it. 
Discussion on this point was postponed ; the Committee did not favour the Gregorian calendar. 
*. The proposal of World Calendar Reform sponsored by the Government of India, is now under the active consideration of the ECOSOC of the United Nations. 
27. Sāyana or Nirayana Reckoning. 
The Chairmarf pointed out that the sāyana year was 365*2422 days and the Gregorian year was 
 
13 
365*2425 days. Thus the error in adopting the Gregorian leap year system would be only 1 day in 3300 years. He favoured the adoption of the sāyana reckoning. 
The Committee agreed with the Chairman and resolved to adopt the sāyana reckoning for the reformed calendar. 
All the members of the Committee agreed to the resolution except Dr. Gorakh Prasad who recorded his disagreement with the resolution. 
Dr. Gorakh Prasad was of the opinion that for civil purposes also the year should begin on the same day as for religious purposes. He thought that the existence of two Indian solar years would create confusion instead of producing any beneficial effects. 
30. Length of the Months. 
Shri Karandikar's view was that the time taken by the sun to go through 30° on the zodiac should be the length of the month. The Chairman pointed out that the lengths of months would vary from 29 to 32, and would cause much inconvenience. 
28. Beginning of the Year. 
The Chairman pointed out that there was an error of 23 days in the present calendars and desired to know whether the Committee would favour shifting of the year for the reformed calendar by 23 days to put an end to this mistake. 
Dr. Gorakh Prasad pointed out that a suggestion to shift the year back by 23 days would meet with very great opposition from the public who will certainly resent such a move. He was not in favour of the shift. 
Dr. Daftari opined that this error of 23 days can be ... left over as it was and allowed to remain as a 
permanent constant error. The increase of the error should be stopped. 
Shri Karandikar said that the Government should have a solar year beginning from Vernal Equinox. He desired the length of the year to be tropical. He suggested that after shifting back by 23 days the V. E. day, viz., 21st March may be the beginning of the solar year, but the pancāngas may start the lunar year from Caitra suklādi. 
The Committee agreed to have 5 solar months of 31 days and 7 months of 30 days in an ordinary year and in a leap year 6 solar months of 31 days and six months of 30 days. 
31. Era. 
The Chairman pointed out that the Vikrama era was never used by astronomers and in different States, there were different year beginnings for the Vikrama Samvat era. For all calculations the Indian astronomers have always used the saka era. 
Dr. Daftari said that the Siddhantas used the Kaliyuga era. Sri Karandikar was of the opinion that either Kali or Kalpa era should be used. 
The Committee resolved that the current Saka Era should be adopted for the reformed Indian calendar. 
29. Vernal Equinox & Winter Solstice. 
· The Chairman said that V.E. was on 21st March and that W.S. was on 22nd December. The problem was whether the Committee favoured V.E. or W.S. as the beginning of the solar year, 
Dr. Daftari said that W.S. is good for the civil calendar. In any case, the seven-day week should not be touched which was agreed to by the Committee. Dr. Gorakh Prasad, Prof. Vaidya and Shri Lahiri favoured the V.E. as the commencement for the solar year. 
Stronon lers 
over 
The following resolution was adopted : 
The Committee recommends to the Government of India that a scientific Civil Solar Calendar to be henceforth called the National Calendar for purposes of dating should have its first day after the Vernal Equinox day, viz., on the 22nd March, but for religious purposes in places where solar calendar is used, 13th or 14th April may be the first day of the year for some time to come (as a concession to the prevailing custom). 
32. Reckoning of Day: 
Two systems now prevalent are (a) reckoning the day from mid-night to mid-night and (6) from sun-rise to sun-rise. The Chairman favoured the mid-night system as the advantages in this system were : 
that the astronomers all over the world, 
including our ancient astronomers used it ; (ii) it was an international system ; (iii) complications due to latitude did not come 
in this system. Dr. Daftari, Shri Karandikar, Prof. Vaidya and Dr. Gorakh Prasad, however, were in favour of reckoning the day from sun-rise to sun-rise ; even though latitude and longitude had to be considered in calculations. Shri Lahiri was in favour of reckoning the day from mid-night to mid-night. 
14 
 
The Committee resolved that in the Indian system of time reckoning, the day should be reckoned from mid-night to mid-night at an All-India Central Station for dating purposes only, but for religious and other purposes the day may begin from sun-rise of the Central Station ; but tables showing local sun - rise for important stations should be given. 
should favour a uniform tethi for the whole of India. Shri Karandikar however opposed the proposition and pointed out that the tithi depended on sunrise and so on local time and could never be uniform for the whole of India. 
It was resolved that in the National Calendar, tithi should be given for the Central Station and the calculations of time should be given in hours and minutes. 
38. Nakshatra. 
33. All-India Central Station. 
The Chairman pointed out that it was necessary for international purposes that Indian time should be 51 hrs. ahead of the Universal Time (Greenwich Time). The Committee considered the question of location of the Central Astronomical Station. 
Prof. Vaidya and Shri Karandikar put up maps and atlases. Prof. Vaidya proposed Ujjain on tradi tional grounds or Jubbalpore on geographical grounds. Dr. Gorakh Prasad and Shri Karandikar suggested Ujjain, while Shri Lahiri suggested 224°N. Latitude. It was decided that a place (821°E. of Greenwich) and having the latitude of Ujjain (viz. 23° 11'N) be recognised as the Central Station for India. 
The Chairman preferred an Indian calendar without nakşatras being indicated. Dr. Daftari however said that the nakşatras should be specified and that Atvint should start with Meşa. It was resolved that the nakşatras should be given with Asvinī starting with Mesa. 
34. Lunar Calendar. 
The Committee agreed that the lunar months should be new-moon ending, and the lunar year should begin with Caitra. Sukla-pratipat. 
39. Recommendations to the 
Government of India. Resolutions proposed by the Chairman and un animously passed by the Committee :-- 
1. A tentative National Calendar for the whole 
of India should be prepared for five years in advance, showing dates, days, months, tithis and nakşatras. (Five years in advance was necessary to find out the practical implications and difficulties which may be caused by the occurrence of 
leap years and intercalary months.) 2. Steps should be taken to compile an Indian 
Ephemeris by the Government of India showing in advance positions of the Sun, the Moon, the planets and other important 
heavenly bodies. 3. There should be a National Observatory at 
a suitable place provided with modern equipment, apparatus and time-service. 
35. The year for Religious Calendar. 
Dr. Daftari said that for the sake of convenience the first point of the zodiac should be 23° 21' ahead of the real Vernal Equinox, and that all calculations should be made on this basis. Shri Lahiri pointed out that in Bengal they had 23° 12'. 
It was decided that the first point of Meşa is to be taken 23° 15' ahead of the Vernal Equinoctial point, and all calculations should be made on that basis. 
36. Names of Solar Months. 
The names of the months should continue to be Caitra, Vaisakha, etc., as at present ; the appellation of solar or lunar should be attached to them as the case may be. 
The point regarding naming of the months of the National Civil Calendar was postponed for the next meeting. 
Monday, the 23rd February, 1953. 
The following attended : 
Prof. M. N. Saha (Chairman) Dr. K. L. Daftari 
(Member) Shri J. S. Karandikar Shri N. C. Lahiri Prof. R. V. Vaidya Shri K. G. Krishnamurthi 
Assistant Secretary, C.S.I.R. 
The Committee reviewed the items covered in the meeting held on Saturday. 
37. Tithi. 
The Chairman said that tithi calculations according to Indian method were wrong at present by sometimes as much as 6 hours and said that the Committee

2. Some members of the Committee suggested that additional members should be taken up on the Committee or co-opted. The Chairman said that, if necessary, additional members would be taken up or co-opted, but only at a later stage, after the proceedings are reported to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. 
3. Discussing the procedure to be followed, the Chairman said that the Committee should request the Government of India to appoint two astronomers to prepare the National Calendar on the lines suggested by the Committee and give them the necessary assistance. 
The Chairman is in correspondence with the Astronomer Royal of England regarding the compila tion of the Indian Ephemeris. 
4. The Chairman proposed to the Committee that Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya may be recommended to the Government to be appointed for the work of compilation of the National Calendar. : 
The Committee recommended that the services of Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya who were both Government servants be got on loan for a period of one year in the first. instance. The Committee also recommended that two assistants be appointed to assist Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya at Calcutta and Ujjain respectively. 
The Committee recommended that suitable budget provision be made for one year for the work.* 
* The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research had made budget grant for implementation of this recommendation and staff of calculators had been appointed. 
ANNEXURE II 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND MEETING 
The second meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee was held on the 8th March, 1954 at 10 A.M. in the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi. 
The following members were present :-- 
1. Prof. M. N. Saba, Chairman 2. Dr. Gorakh Prasad, Member 3. Shri J. S. Karandikar, 4. Prof. R. V. Vaidya, 
5. Shri N. C. Lahiri, 1. Prof. A. C. Banerji could not attend due to his other engagement which was appointed earlier. Dr. Daftari could not attend due to illness. 
2. Dr. Daftari sent a letter which was read by the Chairman. According to his 'suggestion it was decided that Yoga should be given in the Experimental Calendar, but Karana need not be given. Instead of 27 Yogas only Vyatipāta and Vaidhrti calculated with tropical longitudes of the Sun and the Moon should be given. 
3. The following further resolutions were adopted after discussion : 
(1) All festival days and days of religious obser vances in India should be shown and mention should be made of States in which they are observed, as has been done in the calendar. 
(2) The system of starting the year on the day following Vernal Equinox is confirmed. 
(3) Caitra should be the first month and the names of the months should be Caitra, Vaisakha, etc. Alternatively the civil months may be called Meşa, Vrsabha etc., Meşa being the name for solar Caitra. 
(4) The lengths of the months would be fixed as follows : 
Caitra 30 days (31 days in leap years), Vaisakha-31, Jyaiştha-31, Aşādha-31, Srāvana-31, Bhädra-31, Aśvina-30, Kārtika-30, Agrahāyaṇa-30, Pauşa-30, 
Māgha-30, and Phalguna-30 days. Leap-years should correspond with the leap-years of the Gregorian calendar. 
(5) Mahāvişuva samkrānti is to be stated in the calendar on the vernal equinox day and the . Uttarayana samkrānti on the winter solstice day. Makara samkrānti should be on the day when the sidereal Makara is passed (ie, on 14th Jan. as at present). Vaišākhi is to be celebrated on the first of 
Vaisakha. 
(6) Dates of heliacal rising and setting of Jupiter and Venus should be given in the calendar. 
(7) Sukla and Krşna Pakşas should be separately shown and tithis should be numbered from s 1 to 15 and K 1 to 14 and K 30. 
(8) Moment of rising of the centre of the apparent Sun to be given after making correction for refraction. The moment of sunset similarly calculated should also be given. 
(9) The moment of Sun's entry into the naksatra divisions should also be stated in the calendar. 
4. Dr. Gorakh Prasad enquired as to the amount of the precession of the equinoxes adopted in calcula ting the nakşatras. He was informed that the calculations have been made with a constant ayanāmsa of 23° 15', as no definite directive was given in the

Reform Committee to complete the outstanding work, for which the C.S.I.R. may be moved by the Chairman. 
12. The suggestions received from different persons and institutions were read and discussed. 
previous meeting for changing the ayanāmsa year after year. He remarked that this is unscientific and opposed to the actual happenings in the sky. 
5. At this time the meeting was postponed for lunch till 3-0 PM when all the members present again met. 
6. Dr. Gorakh Prasad stressed upon the necessity of calculating the nakşatras ( and also the sidereal Meşādi etc. ) in such a manner that at the time of a particular nakşatra, say Krttikā, the moon may be seen near the Krttikā group of stars in the sky. This practice is being followed since the Vedic times and is perfectly scientific and we cannot change this old systein. Shri Karandikar did not support this and stressed upon the necessity of adopting a constant ayanamśa. The Chairman remarked that constant ayanāmsa was opposed to science. Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya pointed out that if any change is intro duced in the ayanāmša at this stage, the calendar for four years so far calculated will require a thorough revision involving a great amount of labour and time. It was, however, agreed that if the difference be small such as one or two minutes of arc, the labour involved in the revision would not be much, 
7. Dr. Gorakh Prasad pointed out that the Nakşatras and the sidereal Meşādi should be calculated from a fixed point which was 23° 15' in advance of the vernal equinoctial point on a certain date ( the middle of the period of 5 years for which the Pancanga was to be calculated %.e. on 21st March, 1956 ) and the rate at which this ayanāmsa is increasing on account of precession of the equinoxes should be taken into account. 
8. For the purpose of examining the above position thoroughly, the Chairman asked Prof. Vaidya to prepare a note on the Zero-point of the Hindu celestial globe according to the Surya Siddhānta and other older Indian Siddhāntas. This will be circulated and after taking opinion the point in paragraph 7 above will be decided by the Chairman. Pending finalization of this question, the calculations so far made should be regarded as provisional. 
9. The introduction to the report of the Calendar Reform Committee prepared by the Chairman was discussed and the general outline of the report approved. 
10. The activities of the C.S.I.R. on the recommen dation of the Calendar Reform Committee for publishing an Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac on behalf of the Government of India was explained to the members by the Chairman. 
11. It was resolved that an extension for six months should be given to the office of the Calendar 
Memorandum issued by the Chairman to the members 
of the Calendar Reform Committee 
on 22nd June, 1954. In the second meeting of the Calendar Reform Committee held at the C.S.I.R. Building, New Delhi on the 8th March, 1954, Dr. Gorakh Prasad raised the question of adopting variable ayanāmśā for the purpose of calculating nakşatras as well as sidereal Meşadi. After discussion it was, however, decided that Prof. Vaidya would prepare a note on the subject which would be circulated amongst the members, and after obtaining their opinion, the Chairman would decide the question. 
Dr. Gorakh Prasad thereafter submitted a note containing his definite proposals in this respect, which was also circulated amongst the members. He proposed that“ 23° 15' be taken as the Ayanāmsa on the vernal equinox day (21st March ) of 1956, because this will reconcile most of the Pancāngas in India based on modern constants." 
Prof. Vaidya prepared his note and it was circulated. Another note prepared in this office on the same subject was also circulated. It was explained in these notes that the Meşādi of Surya Siddhānta was actually the V.E. point, and as the seasons and different solar and lunar months of the year are connected with Meşādi, the year of the Indian religious calendar cannot but be the seasonal or tropical year. It has also been shown that it is not possible to arrive at any definite conclusion as to the actual amount of ayanansa at any epoch, from an examination of the star positions given by the Surya Siddhanta. 
Replies to the circular letters have been received from Dr. Daftari and Shri Karandikar, who desire that we should stick to the proposals adopted in the first meeting, viz., should adopt a constant ayanāmsa of 23° 15' for our religious calendar. I have consulted Shri Lahiri and Prof. Vaidya also on this question. 
It appears to me that if we accept Dr. Gorakh Prasad's proposal of adopting a variable ayanāmsa for the calculation of nakşatra as well as Mesadi, we shall lose the seasonal nature of the months which is against the Dharmaśāstra, as our Meşādi being the V.E. point cannot be calculated with a variable ayanāinsa. We cannot therefore accept Dr. Gorakh 
 
17 
Prasad's second part of the proposal that the sidereal Meşadi should also be calculated with variable ayanāmśa. It should therefore be calculated with a fixed ayanāmba of 23° 15' as already decided. 
As regards the calculation of nakşatras, I agree that it should be done with a variable ayanāmsa, otherwise the nakşatra divisions will lose all connec tions with the stars or star-groups contained in those nakşatras. For this purpose I agree with Dr. Gorakh Prasad that the ayanāmsa of 23° 15' should relate to 21st March, 1956, the middle of the five-yearly period. 
This is acceptable without entering into any controversy about any particular value of ayanāmsa. 
The result would be that the Meşādi would not coincide with any particular nakşatra division for all time. This has got support of our śāstras behind it, as there is mention of such receding back of the V.E. point ( our Meşādi ) over the nakşatra divisions. 
The five yearly experimental calendar already prepared will be revised where necessary in the light of the above docision.

ANNEXURE IV A Summary of Reasons for the dissenting note by Dr. K. L. Daftari 
This manner of the calendar reform exactly fits in with the work on Dharmaśāstra. We have only to understand the words Caitra etc. and Aśvini etc. to be equivalent to Sāyana Caitra etc. and Sayana Aśvini etc. These, the people will find given in our calendar. Thus the present works on Dharmaśāstra even without any change will continue to serve our purpose for all time to come. Any other way of reforming the calendar will require the changes in the works on Dharmaśāstra themselves and we have no power to do the same because the people do suppose that we have no qualifications sufficient to change the Dharmaśāstras but we can suggest the new and the rational interpretation of the Dharmaśāstras as given above 
The real problem before us is to stop the moving back of the seasons through the months Caitra, Vaisakha etc., in such a manner that will fit in with the present Dharmaśāstra. We can only give a new interpretation or meaning to the words Caitra, Vaisākha etc., and Ašvini, Bharani etc., used in the Dharmaśāstras. From this stand point our resolutions in our first meeting still stand unimpeached. I shall now explain what I say. 
To stop the moving back of the seasons through the months Caitra etc. we must make the months move back with equal motion. That means that the months must correspond to or be pegged on the seasonal year and not on the sidereal year as at present. Therefore our resolutions to adopt the seasonal year for the pancānga is quite correct. All corollaries of this proposition must be correct and must be accepted. The corollary is that as at the time of Caitri Purnimā the moon will not be near the fixed star Citrā and similarly in Visakhā etc., the places where the moon will be under such circumstances must be given some other names and we should name them Sāyana Citra, Sāyana Višākhā etc. We adopt these names being convinced that when the Dharmaśāstras name Castra, Vaišākha etc., and Aśvini, Bharami etc., they really mean Sāyana Caitra, Sāyana Vaisakha etc, and Sayana Aścini, Sayana Bharani etc. The works on Dharma śāstras came into existence before the precession of equinoxes was discovered. The astronomical works written before Muñjāla, had no idea of the precession of equinoxes. At that time the writers on Dharma śāstra and astronomy thought that the seasonal year and the sidereal year were the same and as they had to regulate the religious functions according to the seasons they must have meant by Caitra, Vaisakha etc., the Sāyana Caitra, Sayana Vaišākha and by Aśvini, Bharani etc., the Sāyana Aśvini, the Sayana Bharani etc. That the Dharmaśāstra and the Vedas regard only the seasonal year as the year, is clear from the statement in the Satapatha Brāhmana "44 Sht: Fagfaf 4[at: wala NGHI” (The seasons is the year. The year can stand only by the help of the seasons). In view of this statement it is clear that we will do real justice to the Dharmaśāstras if we understand by Caitra etc. the Sāyano: Caitra and by Aśvini etc. the Sayana Aśvini . etc. If we do not approve of the adjective Sāyana we may apply the adjective 'Cala' which is more expressive. We have to accept this interpretation of the Dharmaśāstras as the corollary of our proposition that we must accept the seasonal year for our calendar. 
Now I shall consider the objections raised by the Pañcānga Sodhana Parişad of Calcutta. The objections are stated in the following sentences. “Our religious festivals and observances were observed during all this period and no difficulty was experienced in any time. We are confident that in future also we shall experience no difficulty by this gradual shifting of the V. E. point. For this purpose if any attempt is made artificially to stop further receding back of the equinoxes, as appears to have been proposed by the Calendar Reform Committee, it will no doubt be completely opposed to our sastric tradition as well as to science". 
e V. E. Door to stop ve been 
in no doub 
This discloses complete ignorance of the history of our calendar system. In the beginning when our ancestors found that the V. E. had shifted back they changed the beginning of the year from one nakşatra to another behind it, for example, they changed the beginning of the year from Myga to Rohini, from Rohini to Krttékā, from Krttikā to Dhanişthā, from Dhanişthā to Śravana and from Sravana again to Aśvini. These changes required corresponding changes in the Dharmaśāstras also. These were the times when the Dharmaśāstra had not become stationary as it has become at present. Our ancestors, therefore, could make necessary changes in Dharmaśāstra also. It was therefore that our ancestors, as the memorandum says, found no difficulty in observing the religious festivals. But now we actually find the difficulty because Dharmaśāstra has become stationary. Take the case of Vaišākha Buddha Trtiyā or Akşaya Trtiyā. In this festival we have to offer to a Brāhman an earthen pot for cooling drinking water. At present we get very hot summer on Akşaya Trtiya and there fore the ceremony is the proper one at that time. In﻿REPORT OF THE CALENDAR REFORM COMMITTEE 
19: 
future however, we shall have rainy season on Vaisakha Suddha Tyttyä after about 2000 years. Will this ceremony be proper at that time? We shall have to perform it at least on Caitra Suddha. Totīyā. This shows that if we stick to the sidereal year we shall then have to change the Dharmaśāstra from time to time. Are the objectors willing to accept such a position? They do not appear to be, because they are staunch followers of the Sastras and they want to follow them literally. The late S. B. Dixit has cited in his famous book some other examples like that of Akşaya Trtiya (see pages 420 to 423), and in fact, we are very unwilling to perform our present functions in any season other than that in which we are at present performing them. The Sastras also as shown above really regard the round of the seasons as the year. It is because our Šāstras regarded the seasons as equivalent to the year, and that our ancestors shifted several times, the beginning of the year from one nakşatra to another, and they added intercalary months from time to time. Are we even now to follow this crude method of adjusting the year to the seasons or to adopt a more scientific method of gradually changing the beginning of the zodiac in conformity with the actual movements in the heaven? 
It is objected that the Šāstras do not require all religious functions to be observed in the seasonal months. The objectors give example of Jonmāştami and say that we need not bother whether it is in rainy season or not. This is not true. We all suppose that the Lord Krşna was born in rainy season and that he was taken from Mathura to Gokul through the flooded Yamuna. We would not like his birth day to be celebrated in the cold seasons. Though the Sastras require Rohini Nakşatra on the birth day of the Lord Krşna, we would rather accept his birth day in the rainy season with Sāyana or Cala Rohini on that day. Similarly about Vaišākhi Purnima, Śrāvani Purnimā, Maghi Purnimā, Sarasvati Pūjā, mentioned in the memorandum, we do like to celebrate them in the seasons in which they are at present being celebrated and on days on which we shall have Sāyana or Cala Viśākhā, Sravana, Maghā, etc. nakşatras. By adopting Sāyana or Cala nakşatras, we will avoid the necessity of two systems, one sidereal and other tropical. suggested by the objectors and which will be too confusing to the public. The adoption of two systems will give rise to difficulties in Dharmaśāstra. It will give rise to questions about the system according to which particular ceremonies are to be performed, and different pandits will give different solutions to these questions. Thus there will be all confusion. On the contrary by adopting Sāyana or Cala nakşatra for all ceremonies and Sayana months, we avoid all confusion and create certainty. 
The evidence in favour of seasonal months is so strong that the objectors make the following statement in favour of them. “In early Vedic times the sacrifices were performed in seasonal months. So all the Vedic festivals should no doubt be observed in the seasonal months.” But the objectors say, "But we do not agree that all other festivals which developed after the Vedic period, are required to be observed in the seasonal months." This objection cannot stand because there is no ground to suppose that the Dharmaśāstra with the object of making a change accepted the sidereal year in place of the seasonal year. 
It may be said that the names Caitra, Vaisakha etc. prove that the Dharmaśāstras accepted the sidereal year in place of the seasonal year. But this reasoning is refuted by the fact that they changed the beginning of the year from one nakşatra to another to keep agreement with the seasons. Therefore the conclusion is that even the names Caitra, Vaišākha etc. in Dharmaśāstra implied particular seasons. Here I will cite the authority of the famous work Dharmasindhu which plans to give decisions without citing authority. 
The work says, TATTW #TATUTATHATTI got of 771:1 Herre a faiforegrafia fetare : 1 amatet arrest 
सारणं प्रशस्तम्। 
Translation : Every two months from Caitra constitute lunar seasons beginning from Vasanta. However when there is intercalary month the lunar season consists of something less than 90 days. It is proper to mention the lunar season in all the ceremonies ordained by fa and afa. 
This means that whenever there is the word Caitra it implies the season Vasanta. This was no doubt the condition when the name Caitrādi first came into existence. But now Caitra comes in hot season (th). The late S. B. Dixit' also says : 
"चैववैशाख है वसंताचे मास हो परिभाषा सर्व पन्थात दिसून येते. ती स्थापित झाल्यावर पुष्कल कालामें ऋत्वारंभ मागें पाला, म्हणून काही ग्रन्थात मौन मेष है मास म्हणजे फाल्गुन-चैत्र में मास वसंताचे अशी परिभाषा पाली. व तीप्रमाणे कांहीं पञ्चांगात हल्ली ऋतु लिहितात. सांप्रत माघ-फाल्गुनांत वसंत होतो. तरी देखील चैत्र-वैशाख वसंत ऋतु ह्या परिभाषेचे प्रावल्य आहेच." 
Translation: The technical language that Caitra and Vaišākha are the months of Vasanta is found in all works. Long time after it was established, the beginning of the seasons receded back. Therefore in some works we find the technical language that the Mina and Meşa i.e. phālguna and Caitra are the months of Vasanta, and in some pañcāngas seasons are written according to that. At present Vasanta comes in the months of Magha and Phalguna. Even then the technical language that Caitra and Vaišākha is Vasanta predominates, 
20 
 
All this shows that even when the names Castra, Vaišākha etc. were used they meant a particular season also and that the season implied. has been changing. The resolutions of our Committee in our first meeting amount to this that Caitra and Vaišākha hereafter shall always mean the Grişma (hot season) etc. The memorandum of the objectors says that in the Dharmaśāstra seasons or seasonal months are not mentioned. To this my reply is as follows : 
In the Dharmaśāstra that enjoins the particular ceremony there may be no mention of seasons or Seasonal months. But the names of the months Caitra, Vaišākha etc. are always there, and the names of the months implies particular season as shown above. Therefore the words Phalguna and Caitra in Dharma śāstra always imply the Vasanta season and Vaisakha always implies the hot seasons. This is the interpreta- . tion that we have to give to these names. By these names they always meant the particular seasons. We can give effect to the real meaning of these names only by supposing that Caitra means Sāyana Caitra, Vaišākha means Sāyana Vaišākha etc. 
I have already suggested above that it is confusing to accept the seasonal year for some ceremony and sidereal year for other. It is better to hold that even the words Caitra, Vaišākha etc. imply the particular seasons and to take the seasonal year and seasonal months for all ceremonies. 
The memorandum raises objections on the grounds of the scientific terminology, Indian tradition and lexicography. This ground vanishes if we say that our names are really Sāyana Caitra, Sāyana Vaišākha and Sāyana or Cala Aśvini, Sāyana or Cala Bharani, 
etc., and if we say that these names express the real meaning of Caitra, etc. and Aśvini etc. used in 
Dharmaśāstras. 
India is the country of blind orthodoxy. Whenever any improvement is proposed the people suppose that they will be drowned in the torrent of improvements, and they oppose the improvement blindly. Any person who wants to introduce the improvement has to be firm and should not give way to such resistance. Signatories of the memorandum are persons who would resist any improvement. Now they would resist the improvement in the calendar and if they become successful they would then resist the necessary improvements in the Dharmaśāstra also. We should not take account of such people and we should take care that we make no abrupt change that would disturb the passions of the people. It is therefore that we have resolved that we should accept 23° 15' ayanārša instead of 0° ayanāinsa as proposed by some enthusiastic reformers. By this I refer to the memo randum submitted by Yeshwant Pradhan, Krishnaram Valgi Bhat and Dattatraya K. Sule who have proposed that we should take 0° as ayanāmsa. 
In conclusion I submit that we have rightly chosen in our first meeting not to make any changes in the works of Dharmaśāstra but to give them correct inter pretation and to make such changes in the calendar as will suit the calendar to that correct interpretation of the Dharmaśāstras. But unfortunately this decision has not been adhered to fully. Nirayana nakşatras have been accepted for the calendar. This makes a change in the Dharmaśāstra necessary. Therefore now I suggest the alternative course suggested in my dissenting note.

(ii) Calculations of Nakşatras and the daily Yogas ( Vişkumbha etc.) are to be postponed till the final decision on the adoption of the amount of ayanāṁśa. (iii) Nearly 60 almanacs in India are following Citrā-paksa whose ayanāṁsa is nearly 23° 12' on 21. 3. 54 and as such adoption of Citrā paksa in fixing the initial point of the nirayaņa zodiac is suggested.

House, New Delhi. Letter dated 23. 2. 53. 
(i) A uniform standard calendar for whole of India is not feasible so far as the festivals, social and religious ceremonies of different parts of India are concerned. 
C.R. - 5 
34 
 
(ii) In:Maharastra, Tilsk's Pancang which is correct and up-to-date is not accepted by the majority of people because of certain festivals, e.g. Dipāli, Holi etc., differing by one month from the other local pañcāngas and as such one uniform calendar for whole of India may not be accepted by the people. (iii) For conveniences' sake India should move for the adoption of "World Calendar" in U. N. O. for India and the world instead of the present Gregorian calendar. (iv) If one uniform calendar is made for all purposes, the Pandits from different localities would move in their own way by propagating their views against a solution for uniformity.

II. For Religious Calendar : 
(i) Religious calendar of India should be luni-solar. (ii) Names of the months should be Caitra, Vaišākha etc., the first month being Caitra. (iii) Lunar month should be reckoned from true new-moon to true new-moon. (iv) During the period covered by two successive now-moons, the Sun may not transit over any multiple of 30° degrees of longitude in some cases, and in such cases the lunar month should be termed as intercalary month. (v) If during the period covered by two successive now-moons there would be two ingresses of the Sun, in such a case the name of the month shall be determined on the basis of the second ingress, the one on the basis of the first having been treated as kşaya month.

(vii) Religious festivals may be determined in the following manner : 
(a) In Northern India, with reference to the true 
sunrise of Delhi. (b) In Western India, with reference to the true sunrise of Bombay. (c) In Eastern India, with reference to the true sunrise of Calcutta. (a) In Southern India, with reference to the true sunrise of Madras . () In Central India, with reference to the true sunrise of Nagpur.

Letter dated 3. 5. 54. 
(i) For all religious purposes tithi, nakşatra, yoga and longitudes of the Sun and Moon should be calculated according to the old system and not according to the (modern) Alnianac system, for simple reason that our religion is based on the words of the ancient sages and pşis. (ii) Nirayana calculation should be accepted. (iii) An observatory should be established. (iv) The advancement of science should be carried out giving due respect to śāstras. 
(viii) Indian standard time should be followed throughout. (ix) Heliacal rising and setting of planets should be given for every parallel of latitude commencing from 6° North and for the meridian of 821° East longitude of Greenwich.

Panjika, Calcutta, Shri Jatindra Nath Bhattacharya, editor, Jyotirbijnan, Calcutta, Shri Sudhibhusan Bhatta charya M.A., Calcutta, Pt. Dwaresh Chandra Sarmacharya M.A., Calcutta and the Secretary. 
(i) The latest astronomical elements should be adopted in the compilation of Indian pañcāògas. (ii) The calculation should be dřk-siddha. (iii) Tho Nakgatra cakra which is purely a sideroal system of astronomy and is being followed in India for at least the last 4000 years, should not be abandoned in the compilation of pañcāngas. (iv). The ayanāṁsa of the pro-siddhāntic period which was used in the Vedic period and in the glorious period of Hindu civiliza tion should be accepted. (v) The Citrāpaksa be adopted in the pañcāngas. (vi) According to Citrāpakşa, 23° 15' ayanāmśa should be accepted for the year 1956. (vii) Rece ding back of the equinoxes should not be stopped artificially as it will no doubt be completely opposed to our Šāstric traditions. (viii) Uttarāyana should start from the actual date i.e. Dec. 23 instead of Jan. 14 as it is now followed. (ix) The festivals which developed after the Vedic period are not necessary to be observed in the seasonal months. (x) The criterion of Aştami Robiņi in commemorating the birth day of Lord Kroņa should be followed, though it may go out of the rainy season, (xi) The tropical year which is being followed in certain religious festivals, should start from the V. E. point and not from 23° 15' ahead of the V. E. point. (xii) The sidereal names of the months cannot be used with the tropical year. For the tropical year, the names Madhu, Mādhava etc. or Prathama, Dvitiya etc. should be used. (xiii) The dates of the sidereal solar months should be standardized. (xiv) The sidereal year will have 12 months commencing from Vaišākba, and general festivals should, however, be linked with the sidereal year.

(iii) Against the idea of taking 23° 15' ayanāśa ahead of the V. E. point. (iv) Against the nirayana system for the following reasons : 
• (a) The authors of the different Siddhāntas could not 
fix the initial point for nirayana calculation. (b) Longitudes of some fixed stars as found in the 
Sūrya Siddhānta do not yield the location of the 
starting point. (c) At present the days and nights are not equal on 
the equinox days according to the present nirayana 
pañcāngas. (a) There is no · satisfactory proof in our sāstras 
that our religious festivals are based on nirayana 
system. (e) The zero year of the Hindu zodiac is different in 
different pañcāngas. 45. Shri Kashiram Sharma, Secretary, Jyotisha 
Sammelana (4th), Upper India, Ambala Cantt. 
Letter datod 7. 6. '54 intimating the recommendations of 
the conference 
(i) The new calendar to be prepared should be on Indign system and the important factors of the Pañcānga i.e.. lunar days and asterisms etc. should be computed purely according to Sūry& Siddhānta, so that there should be uniformity in the pañcāngas all over India and there should be no confusion in the observances of national festivals etc. (ii) The long. 82° 30' E. of Greenwich adopted as the standard meridian of India should be changed to 75o E. to be in conformity with ancient practices which will not in any way interfere with the universally accepted and prevalent zonal time covention. (iii) This conference demands from the Union Govt. that funds should be provided to start as many astronomical observatories as possible to promote the study of Jyotişa, during the next five years. In these observatories Indian astronomers well versed in Sanskrit and Hindu astronomy should be treated at par with modern astronomers. The central observatory should be situated at Ujjain or Kurukşetra. (iv) To promote and encourage study of Jyotişa, it is desirable to start a Central Collego-cum Research Institute and a Central Library of Jyotiga. In this opllege arrangements should be made to teach Jyotişa with all its allied subjects on scientific lines.

(i) For civil purposes 22nd March may be adopted as the beginning of the year but for religious purposes year beginning should be followed according to the different conventions of the States. (ii) The recommendation for starting the calculation for religious purposes 23° 15' ahead of the V. E. point cannot be accepted, as the equinoxes are not fixed. (iii) Supports the recommendation for preparing a National Calendar for the whole of India and for establi shing a National Observatory with modern equipments. (iv) Disapproves the inclusion of tithis and nakşatras in the National Calendar. (v) For religious purposes the duration of a tithi must not excood 65 dandas and must not fall short of 54 dandas. (vi) The calculation of tithis and nakşatras should be done according to the Siddhāntas of India. (vii) To determine the months, dates and time for religious duties, calculation should be made from Surya Siddhānta on nirayana basis commencing from the fixed "First point of Aries" in the zodiac with fixed length of the solar year viz., 365.2587 days.

Forwarding resolutions adopted at the Brihan Maha rastra Jyotish Parishad conference, Jalgaon, held on 3rd, 4th & 5th July, 1954. 
(1) Disapproval :--The decision of the Calendar Reforma Committee of the Government of India, to fix 23° 15' as the fixed ayanāmsa is unscientific and would produce great confusion in future in religious matters, which are fixed in accordance with nakgatras and would produce irreligious ness and harm to religious practice and religious culture. The procession of equinoxes should be taken into account every year while determining the ending moments of nakşatras and the luni-solar calendar be compiled accordingly. 
(2) Approval :- With respect to the other items proposed by the Committee e.g. Sālivāhana Saka and the Caitrādi beginning of tropical solar year etc. are acceptable.﻿PART B. 
REFORMED CALENDAR OF INDIA 
for the five years 
1876 to 1880 Saka 
(1954-55 to 1958-59 A.D.) 
EXPLANATION 
1. Calendar for five years The Reformed Calendar of India includes the following items, column by column : 
of the Sun and the Moon have been taken such as would agree with the figures of Nautical Almanacs. 
(11) Phenomena include New-moon Full 
moon, Vyatipāta (when the sum of the sāyana longitudes of the Sun and the Moon equals 180°), Vaidhrti (when the above sum amounts to 360°), Eclipses, and dates of heliacal rising and setting of 
· Jupiter and Venus. 
Nakşatras-number, name and ending moments. In giving the figures the same procedure has been followed as in the case of tithis. The nakşatras have been calculated beginning from Abviní as 1 and ending with Revati as 27. The period of a naksatra is the time taken by the Moon to travel over an arc of 13° 20' each, commencing from a point fixed amongst the stars about 23° 15' (on 21st March, 1956) ahead of the V. E. point, The actual distance between the V. E. point and the above mentioned fixed initial point of the nakşatra system is called ayanamsa, the true value of which for the beginning of each month has 
been stated at the top of each page. (8) The solar months such as Saura Vaisakha, 
Saura Jyaiştha etc., have been reckoned from Meşadi, Vrşadi, etc. 
(12) Festivals-As far as practicable all 
principal festivals of different states have been fixed in accordance with the calculations shown in this calendar. In this respect the convention followed in different states in the fixation of festivals has been observed as far as possible. 
Note: The name of the month first given is that recommended by the Committee. The other names are alternative ones current at present in some parts of India or used in ancient times.

General Rules for Religious Festivals 
The general rules that have been followed in the fixation of dates of different religious festivals in the Calendar, are given in the appended list. Attempts have been made to make it as comprehensive as possible by including the conventions of all the different States as far as practicable. The well known book 'An Indian Ephemeris' by Swamikannu Pillai has been of immense help in this respect. Other renowned works, such as 'Nirnaya Sindhu, Dharma Sindhu, Vaidyanātha Diksitiyam, Tithitatvam, Utkalakalika, Tantras and Purānas, etc., have been followed in fixing the dates of the festivals and in preparing the list. It may, however, be mentioned in this connection that the rules followed in the observance of religious rites in different parts of India and among different sects of the Hindu community are so divergent in nature that the formulation of any common rule for all India use is difficult. But with a view to securing uniformity, attempts have been made where possible, to lay down general rules for festivals based on the above mentioned religious books. 
Most of the festivals are determined on the basis of the lunar (i.e. luni-solar) calendar, which are therefore shown first. There are certain festivals which are based purely on the solar calendar. The criteria for determining the dates of such festivals are given later. 
The festivals are arranged according to the amanta (i.e. new-moon ending) lunar months commencing from Caitra Sukla. The numbers relate to the tithi with the pakşa (S means Sukla pakşa, and K Krsna pakşa). 
As regards the hour of the day in which a religious festival is to be performed, the prescribed time is noon (madhyāhna) or fore-noon (pārvāhna) except in case of some festivals for which the prescribed periods are different from the general rule. Here noon or madhyānna relates to the period of time from 24 minutes (one ghatikā) before mid-day upto the same time after it. This is the most appropriate time. If this time is not covered by the täthi on any day, the festival is to be observed on the succeeding day of the tithi. Sometimes the madhyāhna is taken to represent a wider period than the above, viz., the 7th, 8th and 9th muhartas of the day commencing from sunrise, a muharta being ith part of the day-time. In Bengal, where however a different rule is followed, the requisite tithi must cover at least one muhurta of purvahna of the day i.e., of the first ird part of the day-time. If the tithi does not cover such a period on any day, then pūrvāhna will have to be taken to represent the period from sunrise to mid-day. In cases where the prescribed hours of the day for the festivals are different from the general rule, the required periods to be covered by the tithi have been specially mentioned in the list in most cases. 
When the requisite tithi .covers the prescribed time on two successive days, the festival is to be observed in such a case on the first day where marked 'Purvaviddha, and on the second day where marked * Paraviddha'. Further explanations of terms have been given later.

Observance of Ekādasi 
As regards Ekādasi, there are various rules for determining the date for fasting. The general rule prevalent in most part of India is that it is to be observed on the day when the tithi is current at sunrise. If it occurs on two successive days, it is to be observed on the second day. When does not occur on any day, it is to be observed on the day of the tithi, but widows and sannyasins would observe on the next-day. But in Bengal in such cases, it is to be observed on the succeding day by all i.e., the day of combination of daśami with ekādast is avoided. The Vaisnavas avoid such combination even at arunodaya ( 4 ghatikās before sunrise ), Nimbārka Vaisnavas avoid such combination even after the preceding midnight.

LIST OF HOLIDAYS Lists of Holidays for the five years from 1954-55 (Saka 1876) to 1958-1959 (Saka 1880) have been prepared on the basis of the Reformed Calendar and are given below. The festivals have been arranged according to the Indian year which starts from March 22 (or 21) the day after the vernal equinox, and ends with Mar English calendar. The holidays have been shown by the dates of the English calendar which can easily be converted into the dates of our Indian calendar. 
Two new holidays, viz., Indian New Year's day (March 22 or 21) and Mahāvişuva day or Year-ending day (March 21 or 20), have been suggested for observance as all-India holidays, and the New-Year's days of different States so long observed on different dates have been omitted. All the holidays observed in different States have been included in the lists, as far as possible, except those of Jews and a few holidays of some States for which the criterion was not available. The festivals of Hindus (including Sikhs and Jains) have been given in the general tables and those of Moslems and Christians have been shown separately.

CHAPTER I 
General Principles of Calendar Making 
sons are 
1.1 INTRODUCTION The Flux of Time, of which we are all conscious, is apparently without beginning or end, but it is cut up periodically by several natural phenomena, viz. : 
(1) by the ever-recurring alternation of daylight 
and night, (2) by the recurrence of the moon's phases, (3) by the recurrence of seasons. 
It is these recurring phenomena which are used to measure time. 
These phenomena have the greatest importance for man, for they determine all human and animal life. Even prehistoric men could not help. noticing these time-periods, and their effect on life. 
When human communities started organized social life in the valleys of the Indus and the Ganges (India), the Nile (Egypt),, the Tigris and the Euphrates fMesopotamia) and the Hoang Ho (China), several millenia before Christ (vide Chronological Table), these phenomena acquired new importance. For these early. societies were founded on agriculture ; and agricultural practices depend on seasonal weather conditions. With these practices, therefore, grew national and religious festivals, necessary for the growth of social life, and of civilization. People wanted to know in advance when to expect the new moon or the full moon, when most of the ancient festivals were celebrated ; when to expect the onset of the winter or the monsoon ; wheri to prepare the ground for sowing ; the proper time for sowing and for harvesting Calendars are nothing but predictions of these events, and were early framed on the basis of past experiences. 
* The Day* : The day, being the smallest unit, has been taken as the fundamental unit of time and the lengths of months, the year and the seasons are expressed in terms of the day as the unit. 
But the day is to be defined. Many early riations defined the day as the time-period between sunrise to sunrise (sāvana day in India) or sunset to sunset (Babylonians and Jews). But the length of the day, so defined, when measured with even the rough chronometers of early days, was found to be variable. This is due to the fact that except at the equator, the sun does not rise or set at the same time in different seasons of the year. So gradually the practice arose of defining the day as the period from midnight to midnight, i. e., when the sun is at the nadir to its next passage through the 'nadir. Even then the length of the day is found to be variable when measured by an accurate chronometer. The reasons are set forth in all astronomical text books. Then came the idea of the mean solar day, and it is now taken as the funda mental unit of time. The mean solar day is the average interval between the two successive passages of the sun over the meridian of a place derived from a very large number of observations of such meridian passages. The time between two passages is measured by an accurate chronometer. 
In addition to the solar day, the astronomers define also a sidereal day, which is the time period between two successive transits of a fixed star. It measures the time of rotation of the earth round its axis.f 
The solar day is larger than the sidereal day, because by the time the earth completes a rotation about its axis, the sun slips nearly a degree to the east. due to the motion of the earth in its orbit, and it takes a little more time for the sun to come to the 
1.2 THE NATURAL PERIODS OF TIME 
The three events mentioned in (1), (2) and (3) above define the natural divisions of time. They are : 
The Day: defined by the alternation of daylight and night. 
The Month : the complete cycle of moon's changes of phase, from end of mew-moon to next end of new moon (amānta months), or end of full-moon to end of next full-moon (pūrnimānta months). 
The Year : and its smaller subdivisions, viz., the seasons. 
* Day here means 'Day and Night. In ancient times, the duration of day-light from sunrise to sunset, and of the night from sunset to sunrise, were measured separately with the aid of water clocks. It was comparatively late that the length of the Day, meaning day-light and night, was measured. It was distinguished by the term ahorātra in Sanskrit, ahna meaning daylight time, and rātri meaning night time. In Greece, this was known as Nychthemeron. 
† Actually speaking, the sidereal day is defined in astronomy as the period between two successive meridian passages of the First point of Aries. As this point has a slow westward motion among the fixed stars, the duration of the so called sidereal day is very slightly less than the actual sidereal day or the period of rotation of the earth.

meridian of the place. We have the relation : 3651 mean solar days=3661 sidereal days. Rotation of the earth = 23h 56m 45.100 mean solar time. Sidereal day 
=23 56 4.091 „ „ Mean solar day =24 3 56. 555 sidereal time 
The actual sidereal day, which measures the period of rotation of the earth is generally taken to be cons tant. The variable part of the solar day comes from two factors : 
(1) Obliquity of the sun's path to the equator, and 
(2) Unequal motion of the sun in different parts of the year. .. 
(See H. Spencer Jones, General Astronomy p. 45). It has however been recently found that even the period of rotation of the earth is not constant but fluctuates both regularly and irregularly by amounts of the order of 10-6 seconds. 
It appears that the Egyptians found very early (as related in the next section) from the recurrence of the Nile floods that the year had a length of 365 days. Later they found the true length to be nearer 365.25 days. 
The ancient Babylonians, or Chaldeans as they were called from about 600 B.C., appear to have been the earliest people who tried to obtain correct measures of the time-periods: the month, the year, and the seasons in terms of the day, and its subdivi sions. Their determinations were transmitted to the Greeks who refined both the notions and measure ments very greatly. This story will be told in 
Chapter II. 
At present it is known that the length of the seasonal year (tropical year) is given by : 
Tropical year=365'24219879--07614 (t-1900) days, where t=Gregorian year. 
The present duration of a tropical year is 365-2421955 days or 365d 56 48m 45°87.

CS 
The Sideroal Year : 
The Month : The month is essentially a lunar phenomenon, and is the time-period from completion of new moon (conjunction of moon with the sun) to the next new moon. But the length of the month so defined varies from 29.246 to 29.817 days, owing to the eccentricity of the moon's orbit and other causes. The month or lunation used in astronomy is the mean synodic period, which is the number of days comprised within a large number of lunations divided by the number of lunations. Its value is given by 
1 lunation=29.05305882–0.40000002 T where T=no. of centuries after 1900 A.D. 
The present duration of a lunation=29:5305881 days or 294 12h 44m 2.8. There are other kinds of months derived from the moon and the sun which will be discussed later. 
In some countries, the ancients took the year to be the period when the sun returned to the same point in its path (the ecliptic). This is the time of revolution of the earth in its orbit round the sun. The tropical year, or the year of seasons, is the time of passage of the sun from one vernal equinox to the next vernal equinox. The two years would have been the same, if the vernal equinoctial point (hereafter called the vernal point) were fixed. But as narrated in Chapter IV, it recedes to the west at the rate of 50" per year. The tropical year is there fore less than the sidereal year by the time taken by the sun to traverse 50", i.e., by .014167 days or 204 246. 
For calendarical purpose, it is unmeaning to use the sidereal year (3654.256362), as then the dates would not correspond to seasons. The use of the tropical year is enjoined by the Hindu astronomical treatises like the Sūrya Siddhanta and the Pasca Siddhäntikā. But these passages have been misunder stood, and Indian calendar makers have been using the sidereal year with a somewhat wrong length since the fifth century A.D. 
The Year and the Seasons : The year is the period taken by the seasonal characteristics to recur. The early people had but a vague notion of the length of the year in terms of the day. In the earliest mythology of most nations, the year was taken to have comprised 360 days, consis ting of 12 months each of 30 days. They apparently thought that the moon's phases recur at intervals of 30 days. 
But experience soon showed that these measures of the month and the year were wrong, but they have left their stamp on history. The sexagesimal measure used in astronomy and trigonometry, as well as fanci ful cycles of life of the Universe, invented by ancient nations, appear to have been inspired by these numbers. 
1.3 THE PROBLEMS OF THE CALENDAR Whatever may be the correct lengths of the astro nomical month and the year, for application to human life, the following points have to be observed in framing a civil calendar. 
(a) The civil year and the month must have an integral number of days.﻿GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CALENDAR MAKING 
159 
. (b) The starting day of the year, and of the month should be suitably defined. The dates must correspond strictly to seasons. 
(c) For purposes of continuous dating, an era should be used, and it should be properly defined. 
(d) The civil day, as distinguished from the astronomical day, should be defined for use in the calendar. 
(e) If the lunar months have to be kept, there should be convenient devices for luni-solar adjustment. 
A correct and satisfactory solution of these pro blems has not yet been obtained, though in the form of hundreds of calendars which have been used by different people of the world during historical times, we have so many attempted solutions. The early calendars were based on insufficient knowledge of the duration of the natural time cycles-day, month and year-and led to gross deviations from actual facts, which had to be rectified from time to time by the intervention of dictators like Julius Caesar, Pope Gregory XIII, or a founder of religion like Mohammed, or by great monarchs like Melik Shah the Seljuk, or Akber, the great Indian emperor. 
Owing to the historical order of development, calendars have been used for the double purpose : 
(i) of the adjustment of the civic and adminis trative life of the nation, 
(ii) of the regulation of socio-religious life of the people. 
In ancient and medieval times, society, state and church were intermingled, and the same calendar served all purposes. The modern tendency is to dissociate civic life and administration from socio religious life. Also due to the enormous growth of intercourse amongst all nations of the world, the need has been feit for a World Calendar dissociated from all religious and social bias. Owing to historical reasons, the Gregorian calendar is now used inter nationally for civic and administrative purposes, but it is very inconvenient, and proposals have been made to the U. N. O. for the adoption of a simple World Calendar (vide $ 2.7). 
during comparatively recent times. The ancient people used very primitive devices. .. The time-keeping apparatus of the ancients were the gnomon, the sundial, and the water-clock or the clepsydra. The first two depend on the motion of the sun, and require correction. The water-clock which probably was first invented in Egypt, appears to have been used down to the time of Galileo, when the discovery of pendulum motion led to the invention of clocks based on pendulum motion or use of the balance wheel. 
Subdivisions of time can be measured by the motion of any substance, which repeats itself regularly ; at the present time in addition to pendulum clocks, quartz clocks, and ammonia clocks have been used. The latter depend upon harmonic motions within the ammonium molecule, giving rise to spectral lines whose frequency can be accurately measured. 
The present divisions of the solar day have interesting history. 
It is stated by Sarton that the ancient Sumerians (original dwellers of Babylon) divided the day-time and 
night-time into three watches each. The watches i 
were naturally of unequal lengths and varied through out the year. It was only during equinoxes that the watches were of equal length, each of our 4 hours. 
These unequal watches continued down to medieval times. The life of a medieval monk was watch-wise as follows. 
(1) Matins-last watch of the night. The monk 
got up nearly two hours before sun 
rise and started his work, (2) Prima--at sunrise, (3) Tertia-half-way between sunrise and noon 
time of saying Mass, (4) Sexta-at noon (hence the word, Siesta 
midday rest), Nona-mid-afternoon, whence our word Noon, (6) Vespers-an hour before sunset, (7) Compline-at sunset. 
The watches were variable in duration and in their starting moments. Sarton remaks : 
A clock regularly running and dividing the day into periods of equal duration would have been, at first, more disturbing than useful. For monastic purposes, a human variable clock (e. g. a bell rung by a monk or lay brother at the needed irregular intervals) was more practical than an automatic one. * 
But even in ancient times, the need for measure ment of equal intervals of time was felt. · The ancient -Babylonians used the Nychthemeron (Day and Night 
1.4 SUBDIVISIONS OF THE DAY 
For pactical prurposes, the day is divided into 24 hours, an hour into sixty, minutes and a minute into sixty seconds. 
.. 1 mean solar day=24 x 60 x 60 = 86,400 seconds. The subdivisions of time are measured by highly 
: developed mechanical contrivances (clocks, watches and chronometers), but they have come into use only

combined = Ahorātra) into 12 hours of 30 Gesh each, Gesh being=4 minutes. The Egyptians divided the day light time into 12 hours, and the night into 12 hours. Later in medieval times, the 24-hour division for the whole day (day and night) has been adopted. The division into A.M. and P.M. were for the sake of convenience, so that the maximum number of times a bell has to be rung, on the completion of an hour, would not exceed 12, for apparently ringing a bell 24 times would be a torture of the flesh. 
The broad divisions of the day were secured by the Hindus in two ways. They divided the day-time (from sunrise to sunset) into 4 equal parts each called a prahara or yāma. The night time was also similarly divided into 4 equal praharas. The prahara is so popular a unit in Indian time measurement that even the lay man expresses time in terms of praharas and half praharas. "An alternative systein of division of the time is the ‘muhurta obtained by dividing the daytime into 15 muhūrtas determined by gnomon shadow lengths. The day muhurtas were measured from lengths of shadows of the gnomon. The night muhurtas are similarly the fifteenth part of the night time. 
As the durations of day and night are not equal except on the vernal and autumnal equinox days, the prahara and muhurta of the day-time have not the same durations as those of their nocturnal counterparts, On equinox days, they are however equal, when 
the same as the number of minutes ( kala or liptika :) in a circle. In Siddhantas (astronomical treatises of the Hindus) there are conceptions with nomenclatures of still smaller divisions of time, but they had no practi cal utility. 
None of the time-periods of the sun, and the moon, viz., the year and the season, and the lunations and half-lunations are integral multiples of the day ; on the other hand, the figures run to several places of decimals. How did the ancients, who quickly dis covered that the time-periods were not integral multi ples of the day, express their findings? 
It will take us a long dive into the history of mathematical notation to elucidate this story. The curious reader may consult Neugebauer's Exact Sciences in Antiquity or van der Waerden's Science Awakening (pp.51-61). In fact, the symbolism was very cumbrous before the discovery of the decimal notation about 600 A.D. in India, where it quickly replaced the old cumbrous notation. The discovery was quickly adopted by the Arabs for certain purposes, but was first made known to Europe by Leonardo of Pisa in a treatise on Arithmetic published in 1202 A.D., but a few more centuries passed before it was universally adopted. 
The practice of expressing fractions by means of decimals came later, both in India and Europe. In India, an astronomer who wrote an astronomical treatise called 'Bhāsvatī' in 1099 A. D. was called Satānanda, (c.e., revelling in hundreds) because he used to write fractions in hundredths i.e. 1 as 25 hundredths, as 75 hundredths. In Europe, the expression of fractions by decimals came into vogue about the seventeenth century. 
The Hindu astronomer of the Siddhantic age expressed the periods of the sun, the moon and the planets by the number of their periods in a Mahayuga (4.32 x 100 years). The number is usually integral. 
But how did this cumbrous system originate ? 
Probably many of these values were obtained by counting the number of days between a large number of periods and dividing them by the number of periods. For example, take the case of the length of the mean lunation (lunar month). All ancient nations give this length correct to a large number of decimals. This must have been obtained by counting the number of days between two new moons, separated by a large number of years, and dividing it by the number of lunations contained in the interval. Of course, tha utmost they could have done was to keep records for at most a hundred years, but the rule of three was always available.

The Hindu astronomers appear to have switched on to the ahorātra during Vedānga Jyotişa times. As it is rather complicated, we do not give an account of it. 
The reader may consult Dixit's Bharatiya Jyotiśāstra. But in Siddhānta Jyotişa, they had a full-fledged scientific system. 
• The scientific divisions of time followed by the Siddhäntas are the ghatikā (danda or nāļi), prahara or yāma, and muhūrta etc. The day is measured from sunrise and the period from sunrise to next sunrise is divided into 60 equal .ghatikās' or dandas ; each ghati is subdivided into 60 vighatis or palas, and each vighatī or pala into 60 vipalas. So a day consists of 60 ghatis or 3600 palas or 216000 vipalas. Thus 
1 ghatikā=24m 08.0 1 pala = 0 24.0 1 vipala = 0 0.4 
The pala or vighati is sometimes subdivided into 6 divisions called a 'prāna'. A prāna is therefore equi valent to 4 secs, of time. There are 360 prānas in a ghatékā and the day contains 360 x 60 or 21600 prānas,

civilization have been described. We have described in Chạp. II, the purely solar calendars,, in which the moon is altogether discarded as a time-marker. This practice originated in Egypt about 3000 B.C. These calendars require only a correct knowledge of the length of year, and are therefore comparatively simpler. They required very little or almost no knowledge of astronomy. 
We have described in Chap. III, the luni-solar calendars, prevalent in ancient Mesopotamia, India, China and most other countries. In these calendars, both the sun and the moon are used as time-markers, and therefore precise knowledge of their motion in the heavens was essential for the formulation of a correct calendar. We mark two stages ; first the formulation of a calendar from a knowledge of only the length of the year, and of the mean lunar month. This was an older phase. It did not work satisfactorily, because it depended on the mean motion of the two luminariés. Actually, the time-predictions have to be verified by actual comparison of the predicted happenings (say of the vernal equinox day in the case of the sun, or the first appearance of the crescent of the moon after new moon on the western horizon) with the time of actual happenings. This gave rise to the need for watching the daily motion of the two luminaries, and invention of methods for recording and storing these observations ; in other words, this led to the science of astronomy. Early astronomy is almost completely calendarical. At a later stage, the five planets attracted attention, on account of their association with astrology. 
We have therefore devoted Chap. IV to calendaric astronomy, which was evolved by the Chaldeans, and taken over from them by the Greeks, and in time diffused to other countries. 
In Chap. V, we have described the various stages of the development of the Indian calendar :--the empiri cal stage (Rg-Vedic), the mean motion stage (Vedanga 
Jyotişa), and the scientific stage (Siddhanta Jyotişa). From 1200 A.D., astronomical studies became decadent in India, and we have analysed the cause of decadence, We have given a full account of precession, as most Indian calendar makers still believe in the false theory of Trepidation which disappeared from Europe after 1687 A. D. 
say the birth day of George Washington, it can be seen from an inspection of his birth register that it took place on Feb.11, of the year 1732. But this practice by itself does not enable à scientific chrono logist to fix up the event unambiguously on the absolute Scale of Time, unless the whole history of the particular method of date-recording is completely and accurately known One must know the lengths of the individual months, the leap-year rules, and the history of calendar reform. In the particular case mentioned, though George Washington. according to his birth register is stated to have been born on Feb. 11, 1732, his birth-day is celebrated on Feb. 22. Why? Because Feb. 11 was the date according to the Julian calendar. But in 1752, England (America was then a colony of England) adopted the reformed Gregorian calendar, and by an Act of Parliament, declared Sept. 3 to be Sept.14, a difference of 11. days. Following the Gregorian calendar, Washington's birth-day had to be shifted to Feb. 22. A scientific chronologist, say of China, would find it difficult to locate Washington's birth-day unless he knew the whole history of the Gregorian calendar. 
This difficulty is more pronounced when we have to deal a luni-solar calendar, say that of Babylon. Many records of lunar eclipses occuring in Babylon were known to the Alexandrian astronomer, Claudius Ptolemy, but they were dated in Seleucidean era, and Babylonian months, say year 179, 10th of Nisan. Now the Babylonian months were lunar, had lengths of 29 or 30 days, but the year could have lengths of 353, 354 383, 384 ( vide $ 33.). Therefore when two eclipse datings were compared, it was impossible to calculate the number of days between them, unless the investi gator had before him a record showing the lengths of years and months between the two events. Ptolemy expressed his datings according to the Egyptian calen dar, which enables one to calculate the interval far more easily. He must have taken lot of pains to carry out the conversion from the Babylonian to Egyptian dates. 
How much better it would have been if a great genius at the beginning of civilization, say near about 3000 B.C., started with a zero day, and started the practice of dating events by the number of days elapsed since this zero date, to the date when this particular event took place. Such a great genius did not appear and a confusing number of calendars came into existence. The scientific chronologist is now faced with the reverse problem : Suppose two ancient or medieval events are found dated according to two different calendars. How to reduce these dates to an absolute chronological scale ? 
For this purposer a medieval French scholar, Joseph Scaliger introduced in 1582 A.D., a system known as

1.5 AHARGANA OR HEAP OF DAYS : JULIAN DAYS 
Though the Flux of Time is a continuous process, it is divided for the sake of convenience and for natural reasons too, into years, months and days. The years are mostly .counted from the beginning of an era, so that if we wish to date a memorable event,

'Julian Days' after his father, Julius Scaliger. The Julian period in years is .. 
7980 years - 19x 28 x 15 19 being the length in years of the Metonic Cycle, 15 „ „ „ „ of the Cycle of Indiction, and 28. 
of the Solar Cycle.. It was found by calculation that these three cycles started together on Jan. 1, 4713 B.C. So the Julian, period as well as the Julian day numbers started from that date. The Julian period is intended to include all dates both in the past and in the future to which refe rence is likely to be made and to that extent it has an advantage over an era whose epoch lies within the limits of historical time. The years of the Julian period are seldom employed now, but the day of the Julian period is frequently used in astronomy and calendaric tables. Unlike the civil day, the Julian'day. number is completed at noon. 
Let us give the Julian days for a number of world events, as given by Ginzel, in his Handbuch der Mathe matischen und Technischen Chronologie.

It may be mentioned here that the ideas underlying continuous reckoning of days occurred much earlier to the celebrated Indian astronomer, Aryabhata I (476 525 A.D.), who introduced it under the designation "Ahargana" or heap of days in his celebrated Arya bhatiya. The idea of counting ahargana or heaps of days elapsed from a specified epoch upto the given date dawned upon the Hindu astronomers as a necessity for calculating the position of planets for that date. They followed the cumbrous luni-solar calendar for dating purposes, which was not based upon any simple rules. It contains months of 29 or 30 days, and occasionally a thirteenth month, the recurrence of which was deter mined by elaborate methods. The dates of the months are not numbered serially, but designated by the tithi current at sunrise. It was accordingly found almost impossible to work out the mean positions of planets on the basis of the luni-solar calendar alone. 
For this purpose a continuous and uniform time scale was necessary, and this was served by the ahargana.. 
"Aryabhata had somehow the idea that the planets, and the two nodes (which were treated as planets in Hindu astronomy) return to the first point of Aries after every 4.32 x 100 years, and there was a unique assemblage of planets at the first point of the Hindu sphere at some past date which he called the beginning of Kali Yuga. The date assigned to the Kali beginning is now known to be 3102 B.C., February 17-18. The common period of revolution of planets of 4.32 x 109 years constitute a Mahayuga consiting of 
Satya yuga of 1.728 x 100 years Tretā yuga of 1.296 x 108 x Dvāpara yuga of 0.864 x 106 " Kali yuga of 0.432 x 106 » 
Total 4.32 x 106 years It may be noticed that 
4.32 x 10° - 12000 x 360 Aryabhata gave tables showing the number of sidereal revolutions of planets in the period of 4.32 x 100 years. The total number of days in a Mahāyuga=1,577,917,800 which gives the length of a year=365.25875 days. 
Brahmagupta was evidently not satisfied that Aryabhata's figures for the periods of planets were correct. He introduced a Kalpa=1000 Mahāyugas= 4.32 x 10o years. The 'Kalpa' was supposed to consti tute a 'Day' of the Creator, Grand-father Brahma. He gave the number of sidereal revolutions of the planets in a Kalpa, and thought he had improved Aryabhața's figure for the year.. 
Brahmagupta's year=365.25844 days. 
Aryabhata calculated 'Ahargana' or heap of days, from the beginning of the Mahāyuga as the zero-day. . 
But evidently this practice involves very large numbers; and is inconvenient to use. Therefore the later astronomers used modifications of the system by counting Ahargana from other convenient epochs, within historical reach. The different epochs which have been used are :-- 
(1) The beginning of the Kali era or 3102 B.C. (2) 427 Śaka era or 505 A.D. as is found in 
Pancasiddhāntikā of Varahamihira. (3) 587 Śaka era or 665 A.D. as is found in the 
Khandakhadyaka of Brahmagupta. 854 Saka era or 932. A.D, as is found in the 
Laghumānasa of Munjala. (5) 961 Śaka era or 1039 A.D. in the Siddhānta

epoch employed for calculation. In which the calcula tions of ahargana as well as the planetary mean places are made from the Kalpa, is called a Siddhānta ; when the calculations start from a Mahāyuga or Kali beginning it is called a Tantra, and when it is done from a recent epoch it is called a Karana. In any case, the mean places of the planets with their nodes and apsides are given for the epoch of the treatise from which calculations are to be started, with rules for finding the ahargaņa for any later date. This ahargana is then made use of in finding for that later date the positions of planets from their given initial positions and their daily motions, for, 
The mean position at any epoch =the mean position at the initial epoch 
+ daily motion x ahargana. Due to the complexity of the Hindu luni-solar calendar, one has to go through complicated rules in determining the ahargana for any particular day. Dr. Olaf Schmidt of the Brown University and the Institute of Advanced Study, in discussing the method of computation of the Ahargana at length, has pointed out that the present Hindu method suffers from a

The use of ahargana plays a very important part in modern epigraphical researches when the date recorded in an inscription is required to be converted into the corresponding date of the Julian calendar. If the Kali ahargana for the recorded date can be determined, then the problem of ascertaining the corresponding Julian or Gregorian date becomes a very easy task.

The Solar Calendar 
2.1 TIME-RECKONINGS IN ANCIENT EGYPT 
(30) 
: : : : : 
Like other nations of antiquity the early Egyptians had a year of 360 days divided into 12 months, each of 30 days; but they found very early from the recurrence of the Nile flood, that the seasonal year consisted approximately of 365 days, and that a month or lunation (period from one new-moon to another) was nearly 294 days (real length 29.531 days). But they had already framed a calendar on the 30-day month, and 360-day year, which had received religious sanction. Hence arose the first necessity for calendar reform recorded in ancient history. To persuade the people to agree to this reform their priests invented the following myth : 
"The Earth god Seb and the sky goddess Nut had once illicit union. The supreme god Ra, the Sun, thereupon curged the sky goddess Nut that the children of the union would be born neither in any year nor in any month. Nut turned to the god of wisdom, Thoth, for counsel. Thoth played & game of dice with the Moon-goddess, and won from her gth part of of her light out of which he made five extra days. To appease Ra the Sun-god, these five days were given to him, and his year gained by five days while the Moon-goddess's year lost five days. The extra five days in the solar year were not attached to any month, which continued to have 30 days as before ; but these days came at the end of the year, and were celebrated as the birthdays of the gods born of the union of Seb and Nut, viz., Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Set and Anubis, five chief gods of the Egyptian pantheon.”

24 August The year was divided into three seasons, each of four months : Flood time, Seed time and Harvest time. 
But the Egyptians soon found that even a year of 365 days did not represent the correct length of the year, which, as we now know, is nearly 3651 days. This fact they appear to have discovered in two different ways: 
(1) from their measurement of the length of the 
year from heliacal risings of Sirius, and from their long record of floods extending 
over centuries. The fixed star Sirius, which is the most brilliant star in the heavens, was early associated with the chief goddess of the Egyptian pantheon, Isis, and was the subject of observation by her priests. The day of its first appearance on the eastern horizon at day-break (heliacal rising) appeared to have been carefully observed, and then on every subsequent day, its posi tion in the sky at sunrise used to be noted. It was found that gradually it got ahead of the sun, so its appearance on the horizon would be observed sometime before sunrise, and on every successive sunrise, it would be found higher up in the heaven. After about a year it would be seen in the western horizon at sunset for a few days till it could no longer be traced. The Egyptians found as a result of long periods of observation, that it came again to the horizon at day break at the end of 3651 days, not 365 days. If on one year, the heliacal rising of Sirius took place on Thoth 1, (Thoth was the name of the first month of the year) four years later it would take place on Thoth 2, and forty years later on Thoth 11. As the mean interval

Let us scrutinize the implications of this myth. This is tantamount to discarding the moon altogether as a time-maker, and basing the calendar entirely on the sun. This was a very wise step, for as has been found from ancient times, the moon is a very inconvenient time marker. The Egyptians maintained the old custom of keeping months of 30 days' duration, and 12 months made a year. But five days (Epagomenai in Greek) were added to the year at the end, which were not attached to any month. They were celebrated as national holidays. Each month of the Egyptian calendar was divided into 3 weeks, each of 10 days (Decads).' 
The names of the Egyptian months together with the dates of beginning of each month as they stood in 22 B.C., are as follows :

. On account of its simplicity, the Egyptian calen 
dar was adopted by many nations of antiquity, and even sometimes by the learned Chaldeans and Greeks, Fotheringham observes : 
of heliacal rising of Sirius at the latitude of Memphis was 365.25 days, the Egyptians concluded that the heliacal rising of Sirius would continue to move round the year in a complete cycle of ca. 1460 years ; called the Sothic cycle, after Sothis (Isis). They also appear to have found from observations over long periods of years that the Nile flood occurred not at intervals of 365 days, but of 3653 days. 
On account of the deficiency of 1 day in the year, the year.beginning lost touch with the arrival of the Nile flood, though the temple priests had devised a method of finding out the interval between Thoth 1, and arrival of the Nile flood by observations of the heliacal rising of the bright star Sirius, identified with their chief goddess Isis. But they kept the knowledge to themselves. 
If the Egyptians carried out a reform of their calen- . dar incorporating this fact, that the tropical year had a length of 3651 days, their calendar could have been almost perfect. All that they had to do was to take 6 extra days instead of 5 every fourth year. But the 365 day year had so much soaked into the Egyptian mind, that this move for calendar reform was never adopted inspite of serious attempts by earlier Pharoahs, and later, a more serious one by the Graeco-Egyptian ruler Ptolemy Euergetes ( 238 B.C.). But it became generally known that the correct length of the year was 3651 days. Fotheringham in his article on "The Calendar" observes : 
An additional day was ingerted at the close of the Egyptian year 23-22 B.C. on August 29 of what we call the Julian calendar, and at the close of every fourth year after wards, so that the reformed or Alexandrian year, began on August 30 of the Julian calendar in the year preceding à Julian leap year and on August 29 in all other years. The effect of this reform was to keep each Egyptian month fixed to the place in the natural year which it happened to occupy under the old calendar in the years 26-22 B.C. But the old calendar was not easily suppressed, and we find the two used side by side till A.D. 238 at least. The old calendar was probably the more popular, and was preferred by astronomers and astrologers. Ptolemy (150 A.D.) always used it, except in his treatise on annual phenomena, for which the new calendar was obviously more convenient. Theon in the fourth century A.D., though mentioning the old calendar, habitually used the new. 
Though not quite perfect, the Egyptian calendar was greatly admired in antiquity on account of its simplicity, for the length of the year and the months were fixed by definite rules and not by officials or pandits. The religious observances fell on fixed days of the month and at stated hours, which were fixed about 1200 B.C. 
"The Egyptian calendar was, upto the time of Julius Caesar's reform of the Roman calendar in 46 B.C., the only civil calendar in which the length of each month and of each year was fixed by rule instead of being determined by the discretion of officials or by direct observation. If the number of years between two astronomical observations, dated by the Egyptian calendar, was known, the exact number of days could be determined by a simple calculation. No such comparison could be made between dates referred to any other civil calendar unless the computer had access to a record showing the number of days that had actually been assigned to each month and the number of months that had actually been assigned to each year. It is true that the Egyptians did not use a continuous era, but were content to number the years of each reign separately, so that there was a difficulty in identifying a particular year, but the astronomers of the Ptolemaic age rectified this by the introduction of eras.* The simplicity and regularity of the Egyptian calendar commended it to astronomers, who found it excellently adapted to the construction of tables that could be readily applied and used even for a remote past or for a distant future without any fear that the system by which time was reckoned in the tables might not coincide with the system in actual use. In the second century B.C. we find Chaldean observations, sometimes nearly six centuries old, reduced to the Egyptian calendar in the works of Hipparchus (126 B.C.), who observed not in Egypt but at Rhodes, and cited from him by the Egyptian Ptolemy in the second century of our era ; we also find in the second century B.C., an Athenian observation of 432 B.C. reduced to the Egyptian calendar on an inscription found at Miletus, which appears to represent the work of the astronomer Epigenes". † 
This calendar survives in a slightly modified form in the Armenian calendar, the three first months of the old Egyptian year corresponding exactly with the three last months of the Armenian year. The Alexandrian calendar is still the calendar of Abyssinia and of the Coptic Church, and is used for agricultural purposes in Egypt and other parts of northern Africa. .. 
2.2. SOLAR CALENDARS OF OTHER ANCIENT NATIONS 
The story of the calendar in Egypt has been given in full, because the ancient Egyptians evolved a very simple and convenient calendar which, as mentioned before, would have been almost perfect (provided the year was taken to consist of 3654 days instead of 365 days). This was rendered possible by their bold initia

tive of discarding the moon as a time-marker. But people in the remaining parts of the civilized world (e.g., in Babylon, Greece, India and China) in ancient and moderm times, retained the moon and preferred the more complex luni-solar calendars described in Chap. III. This was rather fortunate, for if their rulers had adopted the Egyptian calendar, the priest astronomers of ancient nations, particularly of Babylon, would never have taken to observation of the sun, the moon, and the planets, and tried to evolve mathematical formulae for predicting their positions amongst stars in advance (the Ephemerides), which form the basis on which our astronomical knowledge has been built up; for the Egyptian calendar was evolved simply from results of experiences extending over centuries, and required almost no astronomical sense, or observations either of the sun, the moon and stars, except the heliacal rising of Sirius. It was simple and convenient, but like many perfect things, it killed intellectual curiosity. 
But as will be described in Chap. III, the luni-solar calendar is a very complex thing, and has taken in finite variations in different regions. Hence the simple Egyptian calendar appealed to many nations of antiquity as well as of modern times. We have related the case of the Greek astronomers Hipparchos and Ptolemy who preferred the Egyptian method of date-recording to the Greek methods. This was, however, not the solitary instance.

2.3 THE IRANIAN CALENDAR 
The great Iranian conqueror Darius (520 B. C.), whose empire comprised Egypt, Mesopotamia, Syria and Asia Minor, besides his native country of Iran, certainly came into contact with the diverse calendars of older civilizations, but he appears to have preferred the Egyptian calendar to the more complex Babylo nian calendar, and introduced it in his vast empire. 
But the astronomers of Darius made correction of the deficit of 1 day of the year in another way. They had all years of 365 days, but used an interac lary month of 30 days in a cycle of 120 years.

After the Islamic conquest of Persia in 648 A.D., the purely lunar calendar of Islam (Hejira) was imposed on Persia, but it does not appear to have been liked by the native Iranians. 
In 1074-75 the Seljuq Sultan Jelal Uddin Melik Shah called upon the celebrated Omar Khayyam and seven others to reform the old Persian calendar. The calendar as reformed by them was called Tarikh i-Jelali, its era was the 10th Ramadan of Hejira

2.4 THE FRENCH REVOLUTION CALENDAR 
The Egyptian calendar attracted the notice of the calendar committee of the French Revolutionary Government (1789-1795) who wanted to replace Religion by Reason. The committee consisted, amongst others, the great mathematicians Laplace and Lagrange and the poet d'Eglantine. Laplace proposed that the year 1250 A.D., when according to his calculations the equinoctial line was perpendicular to the apse line of the Earth's orbit should be taken the starting point of the French Revolution Era in place of a hypothetical year of Christ's birth. But the calendar committee did not agree with him but started the era of the glorious French revolution, with the autumnal equinox day of 1792 A.D., as this was nearest in date to the outbreak of the revolution. · Sentiment proved stronger than cold scientific reasoning. 
471 – 16th March, 1079 A.D. There are many interpretations of the Jelali reform, the modern interpretation being 8 intercalary days in 33 years, giving the length of the year as 365.24242 days. The year started from the day of or next to vernal equinox. 
The Parsees in India, the followers of the Prophet Zarathustra are the descendants of Iranians who took shelter in India on the conquest of Persia by the Arabs. The following details about their calendar is reproduced from Encyclopaedia Britannica (14th edition), Parsees : 
The Parsees of India are divided into two sects, the Shahanshahis and the Kadmis. They differ as to the correct chronological date for the computation of the era of Yazdegerd, the last king of Sassanian dynasty, who was dethroned by the caliph Omar about A.D. 640: This led to the variation of a month in the celebration of the festivals. The Parseos compute time from the fall of Yazdegerd. Their calendar is divided into twelve months of thirty days each ; the other five days, being added for holy days, are not counted. Each day is named after some particular angel of bliss, under whose special protection it is passed. On feast days a division of five watches is made under the protection of five different divinities. In midwinter a feast of six days is held in commemoration of the six periods of creation. About March 21, the vernal equinox, a festival is held in honour of agriculture, when planting begins. In the middle of April a feast is held to celebrate the creation of trees, shrubs and flowers. On the fourth day of the sixth month & feast is held in honour of Sahrevar, the deity presiding over mountains and mines. On the sixteenth day of the seventh month a feast is held in honour of Mithra, the deity presiding over and directing the course of the sun, and also a festival to celebrate truth and friendship. On the tenth day of the eighth month a festival is held in honour of Farvardin, the deity who presides over the departed souls of men. This day is especially set apart for the performance of ceremonies for the dead. The people attend on the hills where the "towers of silence" are situated, and in the sagris pray for the departed souls. The Parsee scriptures require the last ten days of the year to be spent in doing deeds of charity. 
In modern Iran when Riza Shah Pahlavi came to power in 1920, he instituted a reform of the existing Muslim calendar abandoning the strictly lunar reckoning and introducing purely solar year restoring the early Persian names which had never fallen entirely out of use. 
The names of the months, and their lengths are as follows: Farvardin-mah (31) begins 21 or 22 March Ardibahisht-mah (31) , 21 or 22 April Khordad-mah (31) , 22 or 23 May Tir-nah (31)

The seven-day week was abandoned for a week of 10 days. The month names were invented by the poet member of the committe. The last five days were dedicated to the service of the poor ( Sans-Culottides ) and did not form part of any month. 
After 13 years of service, the French Revolution calendar was abolished by Napoleon Bonaparte, then emperor of France, as part of his bargain with the Roman Catholic Church for his coronation by the Pope. 
2.5 THE ROMAN CALELIDAR 
(The Christian Calendar) What is now known as the Christian calendar, and used all over the world for civil purposes, had originally nothing to do with Christianity. It was, according to one view, originally the calendar of semi-savage tribes of Northern Europe, who started their year sometime before the beginning of Spring (March 1 to 25) and had only ten months of 304 days ending about the time of winter solstice (December 25), the remaining 61 days forming a period of hybernation when no work could be done due to the onset of winter, and were not counted at all. The city state of Rome also had originally this calendar, but several corrections were made by the Roman Governments at different epochs and the final shape was given to it by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C.; the calendar so revised is known as the Julian calendar. 
As already stated, this calendar originally had contained ten months from March to December comprising 304 days. It may be regarded as certain that the months were lunar. The second Roman king of the legendary period, Numa Pompilius, is supposed to have added two months (51 days) to the year in about 673 B.C., making a total of 355 days ; January (named from the god Janus, who faced both ways) now began the year, and February preceded March, which became the third month. The number of days of the months were 29, 28, 31, 29, 31, 29, 31, 29, 29, 31, 29, 29. Adjustment of the year to the proper seasons was obtained by intercalation of a thirteenth month of actually 22 or 23 days' length (called Mercedonius) after two years or three years as was considered nece ssary, and was inserted between February and March.* Had the intercalation been applied regularly at alter nate years the additional days in four years would have been 45 (22+23) or 111 days per year on average, 
and so the year-length would have been 3661 days, only one day in excess of the correct length. But as. the intercalation was applied rather arbitrarily some times after two years and sometimes after three years, the year-beginning gradually shifted and the year started before the arrival of the proper seasons. 
The days of the month in the Roman calendar were enumerated backwards from the next following Kalends (1st of month), Nones (5th of month, except in the 31-day months, when the 7th of month), or Ides (13th of month, except in the 31-day months, when the 15th of month). The day after the Ides of March, for instance, would be expressed as 17 days before the Kalends of April. 
The Romans upto 45 B.C. apparently had rather a vague idea of the correct length of the year. Julius Caesar after his conquest of Egypt in 44 B. C. introduced the leap-year system on the advice of Egyptian astronomer Sosigenes, who suggested that the mean length of the year should be fixed at 3651 days, by making the normal length of the year 365 days and inserting an additional day every fourth year. At the same time the lengths of the months were fixed at their present durations. The extra day in leap years was obtained by repeating the sixth day before the Kalends of March. The name Quintilis, the 5th month from March, was changed to July (Julius) in 44 B.C. in honour of Julius Caesar, and the name Sextilis was changed to August in 8 B.C. during the reign of his successor, Augustus, and in honour of him. There is a very widespread idea that the durations of July and August were fixed at 31 days. each in order to please the two Roman dictators Julius Caesar, and Octavious Caesar, also called Augustus, and for this purpose the two extra days were cut off from February, thus reducing its duration to 28 days. It is a nice story, but does not appear to have been critically probed. 
Owing to the drifting of the year-beginning, the year 46 B.C. started about 90 days before the proper seasons. The months were first brought back to their correct seasons by giving the year corresponding to 46 B.C., a normal intercalation of 23 days after February and then inserting 67 additional days between November and December. This year therefore contai ned 445 days in all and is known as the 'year of confusion'. 
But the perfect calendar was still a long way off. Caesar wanted to start the new year on the 25th December, the winter solstice day. But people resisted that choice because a new-moon was due on January 1, 45 B.C. and some people considered that the new-moon was lucky. Caesar had to go along with them in their desire to start the new reckoning on a traditional lunar landmark. 
* In fact, the intercalary month consisted sometimes of 27 days and sometimes of 28 days and was inserted after February 23. The last five days of February, which were due to be repeated after the close of the intercalary month, were not actually repeated, resulting in the intercalation of 22 or 23 days only.﻿THE SOLAR CALENDAR

The Julian calendar spread throughout the Roman empire and survived the introduction of Christianity. But the Christians introduced their own holidays which were partly Jewish in origin and for this, luni solar and week-day reckonings had to be adopted. 
Origin of the Seven-day Week 
Invention of the Seven-day Week Much of ancient astronomical knowledge is due to Chaldean astronomers who flourished between the seventh century B.C. and the third century A.D., as related in $4.7. They gave particular attention to the study of the movement of the sun, the moon and the planets, which they identified with their gods, because they thought that destiny of kings and states were controlled by the gods, i.e., by the planets, and attached the greatest importance to the observa tion of the position and movement of planets. They attached magical value to the number 'Seven' which was the number of planets or gods controlling human destiny. 
: Historical scholarship has shown that unlike the year and the month, the seven-day week is an artificial man-made cycle. The need for having this short cycle arose out of the psychological need of mankind for having a day of rest and religious service after protracted labour extending over days. The seven-day week with a sabbatical day at the end, or something similar to it, is needed not only by God Almighty, but also by humbler toiling men. But there has been no unanimity of practice. 
In 'Planetary Astrology', the sun, the moon and the five planets, were identified with the chief gods of the Babylonian pantheon as given below : 
Planets Babylonian 
God-names Their function (1) Saturn....Ninib ... God of Pestilence and 
Misery. (2) Jupiter Marduk... King of Gods. (3) Mars.......Nergal... God of War. (4) Sun.........Shamash... God of Law & Order or 
Justice. (5) Venus...... Ishtar....... Goddess of Fertility. (6) Mercury...Nabu......... - God of Writing. (7) Moon....... Sin........... God of Agriculture. 
As already stated, the ancient Egyptians had a ten day week. The Vedic Indians had a six-day week The ancient Babylonians who started the month on the day after new-moon, had the first, eighth, fifteenth, ånd the twenty-second day marked out for religious services. This was a kind of seven-day week with sabbaths, but the last week might be of eight or nine days' duration, according as the month which was lunar had a length of 29 or 30 days. The ancient Iranians had a separate name for each day of the month, but some days, at intervals of approximately seven, were marked out as Din-i-Parvan, for religious practices. The pattern followed appears to have been similar to the Babylonian practice. The continuous seven-day week came into general use sometime after the first century A.D. It was unknown to the writers of the New Testament who do not mention anything about the week day on which Christ was crucified or . the week day on which he is alleged to have ascended to Heaven. The fixing of Friday and Sunday for these incidents is a later concoction, dating from the fifth century after Christ. All that the New Testament books say is that He was crucified on the day before the Hebrew festival of Passover which used to be celebrated and is still celebrated on the full-moon day of the month of Nisan. 
These seven gods, sitting in solemn conclave, were supposed to control the destinies of kings and countries, and it was believed that their will and judgement with respect to a particular country or its ruler could be obtained from an interpretation of the position of the seven planets in the heavens, and the nature of motion of the planets (direct or retrograde). 
The Chaldean god-names are given in the second column, and the functions they control in the third column. Their identification with the Roman gods is given in the first column. The planets* were put in the order of their supposed distances from the earth. 
The continuous seven-day week was evolved on astrological grounds by unnamed astronomers who may have been Chaldean or Greek at an unknown epoch, but before the first century A.D. The Jews adopted it as a cardinal part of their faith during days of their contact with the Chaldeans. It is not their invention. We give a short story of this invention, as it is generally believed. But it may not be quite accurate in all details. 
Further, the day was divided into 24 hours, and each of the seven gods was supposed to keep watch on the world over each hour of the day in rotation. The particular day was named after the god who kept watch at the first hour. Thus on Saturday, the watching god on the first hour was Saturn, and the day was named after him. The succeeding

hours of Saturday were watched by the seven gods in rotation as follows : 
the classics like the great epic Mahabharata. They occur in inscriptions only from 484 A.D., but not in inscriptions of 300 A.D. Even now, they form but an únimportant part in the religious observances of the Hindus which are determined by the moon's phases. . 
It can therefore be said that the unbroken seven day week was not a part of the religious life of any ancient nation, and it is not, even now, part of the religious life of many modern nations. It is a man-made institution introduced on psychological grounds, and therefore can be or should be modified if that leads to improvement and simplification of human life.

The table shows the picture for Saturday. On this day, Saturn keeps watch at the first hour, so the day is named after him. The second hour is watched over by (2) Jupiter, third bý (3) Mars and so on. Saturn is thus seen to preside at the 8th, 15th and 22nd hours of Saturday. Then for the 23rd, 24th and 25th hours come in succession (2) Jupiter, (3) Mars and (4) Sun. The 25th hour is the first hour of the next day, which was accordingly named after the presiding planet of the hour, viz., No. 4 which is Sun. We thus get Sunday following Saturday. If we now repeat the process, we get the names of the week days following each other, as follows : 
Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday... 
The Christian Era 
The present Christian era came into vogue much later. About 530 A.D., the era-beginning was fixed from the birth year of Christ which was fixed after a certain amount of research by the Scythian Bishop Dionysius Exiguus and Christ's birth day (Christmas) was fixed on December 25 which was the Julian date for the winter solstice day and the ceremonial birth day of the Persian god Mithra in the first century B.C. The discovery of a Roman inscription at Ankara shows that King Herod of the Bible who is said to have ordered the massacre of innocents was dead for four years at 1 A.D., and therefore Christ must have been born on 4 B.Ç., or somewhat earlier.

The Julian year of 365,25 days was longer than the true year of 365.2422 by .0078 days, so the winter solstice day which fell on December 21 in 323 A.D., fell back by 10 days in 1582 A.D. and the Christmas day appeared to be losing all connections with the winter solstice. Similar discrepancy was also noticed in connection with the observance of the Easter.* Various proposals were made for correcting the error and the Council of Trent which assembled in 1545 authorised 'the Pope to deal with the matter. When in 1572, Gregory XIII became Pope, these schemes were considered and the plan that was most

The Jews, it may be mentioned, reckon the days by ordinal numbers--the first, second......... seventh day. The first day is Saturday. 
The seven-day week, from the account of its origin is clearly based on astrological ideology. The conti nuous seven-day week was unknown to the classical Greeks, the Romans, the Hindus, and early Christians. It was introduced into the Christian world by an edict of the Roman emperor Constantine, about 323 A.D., who changed the Sabbath to the Lord's Day (Sunday), the week-day next to the Jewish Sabbath. Its introduction into India is about the same time and from the same sources. The week-days are not found in earlier Hindu scriptures like the Vedas or

tion of Jesus Christ, on the first Sunday after the full-moon following the vernal equinox day. The last days of Christ coincided with the Passover fast of the Jews and his death fell upon the day of the feast of the Passover, on the 14th day of the month of Nisan. As the date of Easter is associated with the moon's phases, as well as the vernal equinox day, it is a movable festival, falling anywhere between March 22 and April 25. A movement is going on for narrowing down the range of variation of the Easter day ; in 1928 the British Parliament passed the Easter Act, which contingent upon its acceptance internationally, fixed Easter day as the first Sunday after the second Baturday in April, falling between April 9 and 15.

The objections to the World Calendar plan come from several Jewish organizations, on the ground that the World Calendar plan interferes with the unbroken seven-day week, by introducing Worlds day and Leap-year. Day without any week-day denomination. This, they say, will interfere with their religious life. 
As already shown, the religious sanction for the seven-day cycle is either non-existent, or slight, amongst communities other than the Jews, and even amongst them, it dates only from the first century A. D. The claims of certain Jewish Rabbis to prove that the seven-day week cycle has been ordained by God Almighty from the moment of creation which event, according to these Jewish Rabbis, took place on the day of the autumnal equinox, also a new moon day, is a fantastic conception of medieval scholars, which no sane man can entertain in these days of Darwin and Einstein, 
fraction of people who would want to observe their religious rites according to established usage. 
But these inconveniences can be adjusted by agreement, and it would be egoistical on the part of a particular community or communities to try to impede the passage of a measure of such great useful ness to the whole of mankind on the plea that the World Calendar plan interferes with the continuous seven-day week. Calendars are based on Science, which everybody must bow to ; and on Convention, which may be altered by mutual consent. The unbroken seven-day week is a Convention, but the World Calendar plan bas proposed a far better Conven tion, which should be examined on its own merits.* 
As a result of a request from the Government of India, the proposal of the World Calendar Reform had become the subject of discussion at the eighteenth session of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations held at Geneva during June-July, 1954. Professor M. N. Saha, F. R. S., Chairman, Calendar Reform Committee, attended the ECOSOC meeting at Geneva to explain the desirability of the proposed reform. 
The World Calendar plan has no intention of interfering with the characteristic calendars of communities or nations. They can exist side by side with the World Calendar. For such communities as intend to maintain the continuous seven-day week, their religious week-days, including Sundays, would no doubt wander through the World Calendar week days, and cause some inconvenience to the very small

CHAPTER III The Luni-Solar and Lunar Calendars 
Twelve lunar months of 294 days each, making a total of 354 days, fall nearly 11 days short of the solar year. In the next year, the beginning of each month occurs 11 days earlier, in three years 33 days will be lost.* To fix the same month to the same season always, there are no other means than after two or three years to intercalate a Thirteenth Month, number 
13, by repeating the last month of the year. 
The luni-solar adjustment which is next taken up is the first step to the solution of problems stated by Pannekoek, but it is not howeyer the whole solution, for it leaves untouched the problem of correct predic tion of the day when the crescent of the moon first appears after new moon in the western horizon. This will be taken up later (vide 84). 
Luni-solar adjustment can be satisfactorily made if we have accurate knowledge of the length of the tropical year, and of the mean length of the lunation. Let us see how these fundamental periods were determined in ancient times. 
3.1 PRINCIPLES OF LUNI-SOLAR CALENDARS 
The Egyptians appear to have been the only cultural nation of antiquity who discarded the moon entirely as a time-marker. Other contemporaneous cultural nations, e.g. the Sumero-Akkadians of Babylon, and the Vedic Indians retained both the sun and the moon as time-markers, the sun for the year, the moon for the month. 
The Indian astronomers called the moon māsakrt, (month-maker) and before the Siddhanta Jyotişa time, the moon was considered more important as a time marker than the sun (vide $5). It was the same with other nations too, for as Pannekoek remarks, we find the opinion written in the sacred books of many nations "For regulating time, the moon has been created". 
The retention of both the sun and the moon, however, gives rise to a multitude of problems, of which a fair summary is given by Pannekoek as follows,* 
"With all peoples of antiquity, the Indians, Babylonians, Jews, Greeks, we find the moon-calendar used ; the period of the moon, the regular sequence of the first appearance of the fine crescent moon in the evening sky, its growth to first quarter, to full moon, at the same time coming up later and filling the whole night, then the decrease to last quarter till its disappearance after the last thin crescent before sunrise was seen,—this regular cycle of the moon's phases in the period of 294 days was everywhere the first basis of chronology". 
"But the calendar could not be satisfactorily fixed with the establishment of the moon-cycle. In these ancient times, the people, the tribe, and the state was a political, spiritual and religious unity. Important events of society, the great agricultural performances, the beginning of the ploughing, the sowing or the harvesting were great popular festivals and at the same time chief religious ceremonies, when offerings were presented to the gods. The moon calendar had to adapt itself to the economic life of the people, which was governed by the cycle of seasons. Thus arose the practical problem of adapting the moon-period of 297 days to the solar year of 365 days. This chief problem of ancient chronologis nge been a mighty impulse to the study of astronomy, because it necessitated continuous observation of the sky." 
* Article on 'Astrology and its influenoe upon the development of Astronomy' by Anton Pannekoek, published in the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, April, 1930. 
Length of Seasons and the Year 
The length of the year was obtained in Egypt, as we have already seen, from the recurrence of the Nile flood. In Babylonia, no such striking natural phenomena were available. It is very probable that the Babylonians early learnt the use of the gnomon, with the aid of which they could determine the cardinal days of the year : viz., the summer and winter solstices, and the two equinoxes coming in between. 
The lengths of the seasons were found by counting the number of days from one cardinal day to the next. The number may vary by one day from year to year, and astronomers must have 'realized that the correct length of a season was not a whole number but was fractional. Probably the correct length was found by taking a large number of observations, and taking the mean. The following table shows the length of the seasons and of the year as found by ancient astronomers. 
* The mean duration of a lunar month consists of 29:530588 days and twelve such lunations amount to 354.36706 days, while the length of a tropical solar year is 365:24220 days. The length of a lunar year thus falls short of the solar year by 10.87514 days, and instead of there being exactly twelve lunar months in a year, there are 12.36827 months.

The solar year has thus a pretty nearly constant value, but even the earliest astronomers appear to have observed, that the lunation, or the synodic period of the moon is not a constant, but is variable. As a matter of fact, the period varies from 29 246 to 29.817 days-nearly fourteen hours. The observation of the actual motion of the moon formed the most formidable problem in ancient astronomy (vide 84).

The length of the year was also found by the same method. The solar year is the period between successive transitions of the sun through the same cardinal point. Neugebauer thinks that summer solstice was first used for this purpose in ancient times. But subsequently evidences are found of the use of other cardinal points. 
Thus we find that during the classical period in Babylon, the solar year started with the vernal equinox. But the Macedonian Greeks and the Jews 'started with the autumnal equinox. The west European countries appear to have started the solar year with the winter solstice, 
The number of days in a solar year would vary between 365 and 366. Probably the exact length was determined by counting the number of days between the year-beginnings separated by a large number of years and taking the mean, The Indian practice, followed in the Siddhāntas, is to give the number of days in a Kalpa (a period of 4.32x 10o years) from which one can find out the number of days in a year by simple division. This appears in modern times to be a rather cumbrous practice, but is probably reminiscent of taking the mean for a large number of years. 
In ancient times, people had not learnt to follow the motion of the sun in the starry heavens, so they were unaware of the difference between the sidereal year and the tropical year. But from their method of measurement, they unconsciously chose the correct, or the tropical year. 
Modern measurements show that the length of the tropical year is not constant, but is slowly varying. It is becoming shorter at the rate of .0001 days or 86 secs. in 1600 years. 
So that in Sumerian times, the tropical year had a length of 365.2425 days. The present length is 365*2422 days. 
But all ancient nations show knowledge of an astonishingly correct value of the mean synodic period, which is known to be 29.530588 days. This is probably because they could count the number of days with fractions comprising a very large number of lunations, and therefore the mean value came out to be very correct. 
With the aid of the knowledge of correct values of the length of the tropical year, and of the mean synodic period of the moon, it is possible to find out correct rules for luni-solar adjustment, as narrated below. But this could happen only at a later stage. The first stage was certainly empirical as is clearly indicated from a record of the great Babylonian king and law-giver Hammurabi (1800 B. C.), which says that the thirteenth month was proclaimed by royal order throughout the empire on the advice of priests. AU religious observances were forbidden during this period.* 
It is not known however, what principles, if any, guided the king or rather his advisers in their selection of the thirteenth month, but most probably the adjustment was empirical, i.e.; the month was discarded when the priests found 'from actual experience that the festival was going out of season, Many ancient nations who used the luni-solar calendar, do not appear to have gone beyond the empirical stage.

According to this relation, there were to be three extra or intercalary months in a period of 8 years, and festivals would fall approximately in the right seasons, if these three months were suitably excluded for religious observances. But the rule was only approxi mate. In a few cycles, the discrepancy would be too large to be disregarded.

According to the celebrated exponent of Baby lonian astronomy, Father Kugler, this system was in vogue from 528 B.C. to 505 B.C., then there was an interval when they used to have 10 intercalary months in a period of 27 years. From 383 B.C., the Chaldeans used the 19-year cycle, based on the relation : 
N. B. Years marked * have a second Addaru, and years marked + have a second Ululu. 
312-Seleucidean era-Christian era B.C. 
(Jan. to Sept.) Seleucidean era-311-Christian era A.D. 
(Jan. to Sept.) The 'Nineteen-year cycle' is generally known as the 'Metonic Cycle' after Meton, an Athenian astronomer who unsuccessfully tried to introduce it at Athens in 432 B.C. But there is no proof that it was used at Athens before 343 B.C. The question of ‘priority of this discovery is therefore a disputed one. 
19 solar years =6939.60 days 235 lunar months=6939.69 days. 
There is a discrepancy of .09 days in 19 years, or a mistake of 1 day in 210 years. 
The 19-year cycle, with 7 intercalary months was used throughout the whole Seleucid times (313 B.C. 75 B.C.), as shown by Pannekoek. This system has not been superseded inspite of various attempts. 
These rules came into vogue at a time (383 B.C.), when Babylon had lost her independence and became a vassal state of the Persian empire of the Acheminids. We do not know what was the original calendar of pre-Acheminid Persia, but the great Acheminid emperór Darius preferred the simpler Egyptian solar Galendar to the complex luni-solar calendar of Babylon. 
The population of Babylon could no longer depend upon the king to adjust the dates of their religious observances by royal decree, as happened in the time of Hammurabi (1800 B.C.). Probably therefore the priest-astronomers felt the need of mathematical rules which should take the place of royal decrees.. 
3.3 THE LUNI-SOLAR CALENDARS OF THE BABY LONIANS, THE MACEDONIANS, THE ROMANS, 
AND THE JEWS In addition to the Chaldeans, many other nations of antiquity, viz..the Vedic Indians, the Greeks, the Romans and the Jews and others used the luni-solar calendar, and had to make luni-solar adjustments. It will be tedious to relate how they did it, except in the case of the Vedic Indians (vide $ 5). But the knowledge of the nineteen-year rule appears to have diffused to all countries by the first century of the Christian era. From this time onwards, the lunar months of different nations appear to be interchange able. This is shown in the following Table No. 4. 
We have almost complete knowledge of the luni solar calendars of the Babylonians during Seleucid times. The names of months with their normal lengths are shown in column (2) of the table.

month-lengths were also the same as in the Chaldean 19-year system. When the Sakas and Kushans began to rule in India, from first century B.C., they used the Macedonian months alternatively with the Indian months which are shown in the first column. The first Indian season, Spring, however, according to imme morial Indian custom, has been on both sides of the vernal equinox (-30° to 30°), while in the Graeco Chaldean system, the Spring started with vernal equinox (0°). The first Indian month is Caitra, the first of the spring months, and according to rules prevalent in Siddhāntic times (300 A.D.), the month was to be always on the lower side of the vernal equinox, i.e., the beginning of lunar Caitra was to be on a date before the vernal equinox. It may be added that the Indian lunar months mentioned here are amānta or new moon ending.

Veadar The first Babylonian month Nisannu, started with 30 days, and other months were alternately 29 and 30 days. A normal year thus consisted of 354 days, but occasionally an extra'day was added to the last month, and it became a year of 355 days. 
The effect of these intercalations was that the first month, viz., the month of Nisannu, never strayed for more than 30 days beyond the day of vernal equinox. . 
As the table shows, the Babylonian year might be of 354, 355, 383, or 384 days” duration, and occasio nally it is said that they extended to 385 days. It was therefore impossible to calculate the number of days between two incidents, dated according to the Chaldean calendar, unless the investigator had a table of past years showing the lengths of each individual year. Herein comes the superiority of the Egyptian system, where the number of days between two incidents, dated according to the Egyptian system, could be easily calculated. The two greatest astro nomers of ancient times, Hipparchos and Ptolemy, therefore, preferred the Egyptian system of dating to the Chaldean or the Macedonian. 
.. The Macedonian Greeks used the months given in column (3) in their home land. When they settled in Babylon as rulers (313 B.C.), they continued to use the same months, but got them linked to Chaldean months. Their first month was Dios, which was the seventh month of Chaldeans. This was probably linked to the autumnal sguinox in the same way as Nisannu was to the vernal equinox. The Macedonian year started six months earlier than the Chaldean year. 
· The Macedonian months were used by the Parthians, the early Sakas, and the Kushans in India wihout change of name (vide $ 5.5), and probably the 
3.4 THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ERA For accurate date-recording, we require besides the month and the day, also a continuously running era. But the era came rather late in human history. We find dated records of kings in Babylon from about 1700 B.C. (Kassite kings). They used regnal years, lunar months, and the day of the lunar month. The ancient Egyptian records do not use any era, but sometimes the regnal years. But the use of regnal years is very inconvenient for purposes of exact chronology, because one has to locate the beginning of the reign of the king on the time-scale which often proves to be an extremely difficult problem, e.g., in India, Emperor Asoke used regnal years, but it is a problem of nearly hundred years for archaeologists to find out the exact date of the commencement of his reign. This varies from 273 B.C. to 264 B.C. 
In the writings of the Greek astronomers Hippar chos (140 B.C.) and Ptolemy (150 A.D.), we come across an era purporting to date from the time of one king Nabu Nazir of Babylon (747 B.C.), who -is known to history, though this era is not used in records of the Babylonian kings themselves. 
The inference has been made, though without clear proof, that the Babylonian or rather Chaldean astronomers who were the earliest systematic observers of the heavenly bodies, get tired of the use of the regnal years, and felt the need of a continuously running era for precision in time-reckoning. They took advantage of a unique gathering of planets about Feb. 26, 747 B.C. when Nabu Nazir was reigning.in Babylon to proclaim that the gods have ordained the 'introduction of a continuously running era' ( Sky and Telescope, Vol. I, p. 9, April, 1942). 
But the use of the Nabɔnassar era appears to have been confined to astronomers. The kings continued 
178 
 
spread over all these countries, as is apparent from contemporary inscriptions and coin-datings mentioned in $ 5.5. The months were amānta, i.e., started after the new-noon was completed and were pegged on to the solar year which started on the day of the vernal equinox. The Nisan was the first lunar month after the vernal equinox. There were 7 intercalary months in a period of 19 years. The correspondence between Chaldean and Greek months and the position of the intercalary months have been worked out by Prof. Pannekoek between the years 134-247 of the Seleuci dean era, as already given (vide $ 3.2 and 3.3) along with their Indian equivalent lunar months. 
to record events in their regnal years as this had a great propaganda value for the royal family which they were unwilling to forego. : It is now known that the other ancient eras, like that of the Greek Olympiads (776 B.C.) or the era of Foundation of Rome (753 B.C.) are extrapolated eras, The ancient Greek method of dating by Olympiads is of uncertain origin, but the system was critically examined by the Alexandrian chronologists, parti cularly Eratosthenes (3rd century B.C.), the founder of scientific chronology. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, Greek chronology is not reliable till the 50th Olympiad (i.e. 576 B.C.). The era was therefore invented a long time after its alleged year of starting. The era of the Foundation of Rome had a similar history (see Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, Chronology). The starting years of these eras are suspiciously close to that of the Nabonassar era (747 B.C.). Probably both these eras were plagiarized from the era of Nabonassar after the savants of ancient Greece and Rome acquired the time-sense.. 
It is noteworthy that Hipparchos and Ptolemy used neither the era of Olympiads nor the era of Foundation of Rome, nor Greek or Chaldean months which were lunar, but the Nabonassar era and the more con venient Egyptian solar months. They preferred science to nationalistic chauvinism. 
The Seleucidean and other derived Eras The Seleucidean Era (the S. E. era) : The first continuously running era which ran into general circulation is that introduced to commemorate the foundation of Seleucus's dynasty and dates from the year when Seleucus occupied the city of Babylon after defeating his rivals. There were two methods of counting, differing in the initial year and the first day of the year. 
According to the official (Macedonian) reckoning, the era started from the lunar month of Dios (near autumnal equinox) in the year (-311) A.D. or 312 B.C. 
The months had Macedonian names. 
According to the native Babylonian reckoning, the era started from the lunar month of Nisan (near vernal equinox) six months later than the starting of the Macedonian year. The months had Chaldean names, as given in Table No. 4. 
The Seleucid monarchs ruled over a vast empire from Syria to the borders of Afghanistan from 311 B.C. to 65 B.C. 8.e., nearly for 250 years and under their rule, the knowledge of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy and time-calculations spread far and wide, ultimately reaching India, and profoundly modifying the indige nous system in India. The use of Macedonian months 
The Parthian Era Since the introduction of the Seleucidean era, the practice arose for a nation or a dynasty to start eras commemorating some great event in their national or dynastic life. The first in record is the Parthian era, and the story of its starting is well-known. The Seleucid emperors ruled the Near East from 312 B.C. imposing on the countries under their domination Greek culture, the Seleucidean era, and the Graeco Chaldean system of time-reckoning. About 250 B.C., there were wide-spread revolts against Seleucid rule in Bactria, in Parthia (Eastern Persia), and other parts. of the Near East. The revolt in Parthia was led by one Arsaces and his brother Tiridates who belonged to an Iranian tribe, which had adopted Greek culture. To commemorate their liberation from Seleucidean rule, the Parthians introduced an era, beginning 64 years after the Seleucid era (i.e. 248 B.C.), But at first this era (Arsacid era) was only rarely used. The early Parthian emperors preferred to use on their coins the Seleucidean era, the Macedonian months, and the Graeco-Chaldean system of time reckoning inscribed in Greek letters. In the first century A.D., there was a Zoroastrian revival, the S.E. was dropped in favour of the Parthian era and Pehlevi began to be used in place of Greek, though Macedonian month-names were still kept. 
Though kings bearing Parthian names ruled at Taxila about the first century B.C. to first century A.D., e.g., king Gondophernes, no clear evidence of the use of the Parthian era on Indian soil has yet been found. 
It is very likely that the Saka era, with its methods of calendar-reckoning, which came into vogue in India during the Siddhanta Jyotişa times, was started by the Saka tribes when they attained prominence, and started an era of their own, in imitation of the Parthians. They, however, retained the Graeco Chaldean method of lunar month-reckoning and probably the same system of intercalary months.﻿-

two, i.e., 2nd day of week), ha (he, five, i.e., fifth hour after sunset) and Rad (Resh, dalet, 204 minims after the hour). 
(2) In the Bible various eras occur, e.g., the Flood, the Exodus, the Earthquake in the days of King Uzziah, the regnal years of monarchs and the Babylonian exile. During the exile and after, Jews reckoned by the years of the Persian kings. Such reckonings occur not only in the Bible (e.g., Daniel viii, I) but also in the Assouan papyri. After Alexander, the Jews employed the Seleucid era (called Minyan Shetaroth, or era of deeds, since legal deeds were dated by this era). · So great was the influence exerted by Alexander, that this era persisted in the East till the 16th century, and is still not extinct in south Arabia. This is the only era of antiquity that has survived. Others, which fell into disuse, were the Macca baean eras, dating from the accession of each prince, and the national era (143-142 B.C.), when Judæa became free under Simon. That the era described in Jubilees was other than bypothetical, is probable. Dates have also been reckoned from the fall of the second Temple (Le-Horban hab-bayyith). The equation of the eras is as follows : 
The ancient Jewish calendar was lunar, the beginning of the month being determined by the first. visibility of the lunar crescent. As the month-names show (col. 4 of the table No. 4.), they were evidently derived from the Babylonian month-names excepting . one or two, viz., Marheshvan and Tammuz. The day began in the evening and probably at sunset. The year used to begin with the spring month Abib or Nisan, the latter being the Babylonian name of the month which was adopted by the Jews in the post-exilic times. Intercalation was performed, when necessary, repeating the twelfth month 'Adar' which was then known as "Veadar followed by Adar. The year beginning was subsequently changed and in the last century before Christ, it became the month of Tishri, corresponding to the Macedonian month of Dios. This must have been due to the desire or need to follow the practice of the ruling race. 
Originally there were no definite rules for inter calation and for fixing up the beginning of the months. Because various religious festivals and sacrifices were fixed with reference to the beginning of the month, information about it was spread throughout the country by messengers and by signal fires on hilltops. 
About the 4th century A.D., fixed rules were introduced in the calendar and nothing was left to observation or discretion. Intercalation is governed by a 19-year cycle in which the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th and 19th years have got an extra month. The actual beginning of the initial month of the year, viz., Tishri is obtained from the mean new-moon by complicated rules which are designed to prevent certain solemn days from falling on inconvenient days of the week. As a result, a common year may consist of 353, 354 or 355 days and an embolismic or leap-year of 383, 384 or 385 days. Ten of the months have got fixed durations of 29 or 30 days, as well as the intercalary month which contains 30 days, the other two varying according to the requisite length of the year.

The 'Era of Creation' is supposed to have started from the day of autumnal equinox of the year 3761 B.C. So the sun and the moon must have existed before the day of creation !! 
3.6 THE ISLAMIC CALENDAR 
The Mohammedan calendar is purely lunar and has no connection with the solar year. The year consists of 12 lunar months, the beginning of each month being determined by the first observation of the crescent moon in the evening sky. The months have accordingly got 29 or 30 days and the year 354 or 355 days. The new-year day of the Mohammedan calendar thus retrogrades through the seasons and completes the cycle in a period of about 324 solar years. 
The era of the Mohammedan calendar, viz., the Hejira (A.H.), which was probably introduced by the Caliph Umar about 638-639 A.D., started from the evening of 622 A.D., July 15, Thursday, when the crescent moon of the first month Muharram of the Mohammedan calendar was first visible. This was the new-year day preceding the emigration of Muhammad from Mecca which took place about Sept. 20 (8 Rabi I), 622 A.D. 
The Jewish Era of Creation The Jews use an Era (Anno Mundi, libriath olum) or 'Era of Creation' which is supposed to have been started from the day of creation of the world. We quote the following passages from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, 'Chronology, Jewish'. 
(1) The era is supposed to begin, according to the mnemonic Beharad, at the beginning of the lunar cycle on the night between Sunday and Monday, Oct. 7, 3761 B.C., at 11 hours 115 minutes P.M. This is indicated by be (beth, 
*As the day of the Islamic calendar commences from sunset, Friday started from the evening of that day. 
C. B.-31

30. 
.. 
......30 
For astronomical and chronological purposes the lengths of the months are however fixed by rule and not by observation. The lengths of the months in days for this purpose are as follows: 
Muharram Safar Rabi-ul awwal Rabi-us sani Jamada'l awwal ....... Jamada-s sani Rajab Shaban Ramadan Shawal 
....29 Zilkada . ......30 Zilhijja 
. ......29 (or 30) The leap-year, in which Zilhijja has one day more, contains 355 days and is known as Kabishah. In a cycle of 30 years, there are 19 common years of 354 days and 11 leap-years of 355 days. Thus 360 lunations are made equivalent to 10,631 days or only :012 days less than its actual duration. The rule for determining the leap year of this fixed 'calendar is that, if after dividing the Hejira year by 30, the remainder is 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26 or 29, then it is á leäp-year. 
The only purely lunar calendar is the Islamic Calendar', which has been in vogue amongst the followers of Islam since the death of the Prophet Muhammad (632 A.D:). But it is well-known that before this period Mecca observed some kind of luni solar calendar in common with all countries of the Near East. The common story is that when pilgrims from distant countries and other parts of Arabia came to perform Hajj at Mecca (Hajj is a pre-Islamic practice), they often found that it was an intercalary month according to Meccan calculation, when no religious festival could be performed, and had to wait for a month before they were allowed to perform the rites. This meant great hardships for distant visitors and to prevent recurrence of such incidents the Prophet forbade the use of intercalary or 13th month and decreed that the calendar should henceforth be purely lunar. 
It has now been shown by Dr. Hashim Amir Ali of the Osmania University, Hyderabad, that the Moha mmedan calendar was originally luni-solar in which intercalation was made when necessary, and not purely lunar. This view-point has now been strongly supported by Mohammed Ajmal Khan of the Ministry of Education, Govt. of India. They emphasize that upto the last year of the life of Mohammed, i.e., upto A.H. 10 or A.D. 632, a thirteenth month was inter calated when necessary. The Arabs, among whom there were relatively few men conversant with astro nomical calculations, had a system in which a family of astronomers, known as Qalammas was responsible for proclaiming at the Hajj (falling in the last month of the year : Zilhijja) that a thirteenth month would or would not be added. Astronomically such intercala tion should be made 3 times in 8 years or 7 times in 19 years. The elder of the Qalamma had a certain amount of discretion in determining when this intercalation was to be practised, and this very practice afterwards caused great confusion. . 
According to this view, proper intercalation was applied in all the years where necessary upto A.H. 10 and consequently the year A.H. 11 (coming next to the Hajj of A.H. 10) which started on March 29, 632 A.D. (i.e., after the vernal equinox day) seems to have been a rather normal year, and as such all the previous new-year days appear to have been celebrated on the visibility of the crescent moon after the veral equinox day. The Muslim months should accordingly occupy permanent places in the seasons as follows* : 
· Muharram... Mar.-April Rajab ... Sept.-Oct. Safar... ... April-May Shaban ... Oct.—Nov. Rabi I ... May - June Ramadan ...Nov.-Dec. Rabi II ... June — July Shawal ... Dec.-Jan. Jamadi I ... July --Aug. Zilkada ... Jan. - Feb. Jamadi II ... Aug. Sept. Zilhijja ...Feb. -Mar. 
. * If this view is accepted, it would then be necessary to shift the starting epoch of the Hejira era, which is commonly accepted as July 16, 622 A.D., to an earlier date, ag 4 intercalary months or 118 days will then have to be inserted between the new-year days of A.H. 1 and of A.H. 11, which is March 29, 632 A.D. The initial epoch of the Hejira era thus arrived at is the evening of March 19, 622 A.D., Friday, the day following the vernal equinox.

Calendaric Astronomy 
4:1 THE MOON'S MOVEMENT IN THE SKY 
The scheme of lunar months given in Table No. 4 in: a nineteen-year period, which came into vogue in Babylon about 383 B.C. did not, however, completely satisfy the needs of the Babylonian calendar, because for religious purposes, the month was to start on the day the crescent moon was first visible in the western horizon after conjunction with the sun (the new 
and the moon move uniformly in the same great circle in the heavens. But even the most primitive observers could not fail to notice that neither do the two luminaries move in the same path, nor do they move uniformly, each in its own path. 
The motion of the moon amongst the stars is the easiest to observe. This is illustrated in the two figures reproduced from the Sky and Telescope, giving

Fig. 3–Showing the positions of the sun, moon and planets among the stars in July, 1953. The table given on p. 176 is based on mean values The central horizontal line is the line of the of the lengths of the year and the synodic month, celestial equator ($ 4.4), and the sinuous line represents which is equivalent to the assumption that the sun the ecliptic or the sun's path (8 4.5), but we may

The, 
ignore these now, and simply concentrate on the moon and the stars or star-clusters near which it passes. 
The moon begins as a thin crescent on the western horizon on the evening of June 12, the day of the first visibility after the new-moon, at an angle of 11°, from the sun which has just set, below the bright stars Castor and Pollux (Punarvasu). Then we notice the position of the moon, on successive evenings at sunset: We find she is moving eastward at the rate of about 13° and becoming fuller (increasing in phase). She passes the bright star Regulus (Magha) on the 17th, on the 19th, she is half and passes B Leonis (Uttara Phalguni) leaving it a good deal to the north. Then she passes the bright star Spica ( a Virginis or Citra) on the 21st, and is then gibbous on the 23rd near the star a-libra (Visakha). Then she passes the well known Scorpion-cluster and becomes full on the 27th, near a star-cluster which cannot be seen on the night of full-moon, but can be detected later as the star cluster Sagittarius. On the full moon day, she rises nearly at sunset, at 180° from the sun (opposition). On each successive night after full moon she rises later and later, and passes the phases in the reverse order, i.e., becomes gibbous on June 30, when she has the bright star Altair (Śravaņa) far to the north and is half on July 4, and becomes a crescent on July 7 on the eastern sky, and then fails to appear for three days, and must have passed the sun on the 11th July which is the new moon day, when she is with the sun (Amārasyā or conjunction, lit. the sun and the moon living together). On the 12th July, she reappears on the western horizon as a thin crescent, near the star ó-Cancri (Puşya), and the cycle again starts. 
The crescent of the moon, either in the western or the eastern sky, is always turned away from the sun. 
The ancients must have observed the motion of the moon day after day, from new-moon to new-moon (a full lunation or lunar month) and become familiar with the stars or star-clusters which she passes. It is always easy to observe them when the moon is a crescent ; when the moon becomes fuller, the stars are lost in the moon's glare particularly if they are faint. But if observations be carried on for a number of years, the observers would become familiar with all the stars or star-clusters which the moon passes. 
Bogii observations like this, the ancients must have found that both the moon and the sun are moving to the east, the moon Vexy fast, the sun more slowly. By the time the moon, after making a whole round, comes back to the sun, the latter has moved further to the east by about 30°. For example in the above figures Nos. 2 and 3, the sun was somewhat to the west of the 
bright star-group Orionis (Mrgasiras) to the west of Castor and Pollux on June 11th, the day of the new mgon. But on the next new-moon day, July 11th, she has moved near Castor and Pollux (Punairasu) about 30° to the east. 
The ancients must have found that the moon takes a little over 27.3 days (sidereal period of the moon), to return to the same star, but to overtake the sun, it takes a little longer, a little over 29.5 days (the synodic period of the moon). Exactly, 
the mean sidereal period=27.321661 days 
=27a 7h 43m 118.5 with a variation of + 31 hours and the mean synodic period=29.530588 days 
= 298 126 441 28. with a variation of +7 hours. 
The Lunar Mansions : Many ancient nations developed the habit of designating the day-to-day (or night-to-night) position of the moon by the stars or star-clusters it passed on successive nights. The number of such stars or star clusters was either 27 or 28 ; the ambiguity was due to the fact that the mean sidereal period of the moon is about 27$ days, the actual period having a variation of seven hours, and the ancients who did not know how to deal with fractions, oscillated between 27 and 28. In India, originally there were 28 nakşatras, but ultimately 27 was accepted as the number of lunar nakşalras (or asterisms). 
The lunar zodiac is also found amongst the Chinese who designate them by the term Hsiu ; and amongst the Arabs, who call them Manzil, both terms denoting man sions. Both the Chinese and the Arabs had 28 mansions. The Indian term 'nakşatra' is of uncertain etymological origin. Some hold that the term nakşatra carried the sense that 'it does not move' and meant a star. 
Names of certain nakşatras' are found in the oldest scriptures of India, viz., the Rg-Vedas, but a full list is first found in the Yajurveda (vide § 5-3). In the older classics of India ( the Yajurveda, the Mahābhārata), the nakşatras invariably start with Kritikā, the Pleiades ; the supposition has been made that the Kritikās were near the vernal point, when this enumeration was started. This is apparent from the couplet found in the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa which runs thus : 
Taittiriya Brāhmana, i, 1, 2, 1. Krttikā svagnimādadhita. 
Mukham vă etanna ksatrānām, Yatkrttikā. Translation: One should consecrate the (sacred) fire in the Krttikās ;--the Kritikās are the mouth of the nakşatras. 
CALENDARIC ASTRONOMY 
183 
Later during Siddhanta Jyotişa times the enumeration started with Aśvini bafi Arietis).. and this tis. still reckoned to be the first of the naksatras, although the vernal point has now receded to the Uttdralltādrapada group which should accordingly be taken as the first nakşatra. But the change has not been done because the Indian astrologers have failed to correct the calendar for the precession of equinoxes. 
The Chinese start their Hsius with Citrā or a Virginis. This refers probably to the time when a Virginis was near the autumnal equinoctial point (285 A.D.). The Arabs start their Manzils with B Arietis (Ash-Sharaţāni). 
There has been a good deal of controversy regarding the place of origin of the lunar zodiac. Many savants were inclined to ascribe the origin of the 27 nakşatra system to ancient Babylon, like all other early astro nomical discoveries. But as far as the authors of this book are aware, there is no positive evidence in favour of this view. Thousands of clay tablets containing astronomical data going back to 2000 B.C., and extending up to the first century A.D. have been obtained, but none of them are known to have any „ reference to 27 or 28 lunar mansions. 
On the other hand (as mentioned before) some of the nakşatra names are found in the oldest strata of the Rg-Vedas (ride § 5-2), which must be dated before 1200 B.C., and a full list with some difference in names is found in the Yajur-Veda, which must be dated before 600 B.C. Nobody has yet been able, to refute yet Max Muller's arguments in favour of the indigenous origin of the Indian nakşalra system given in his preface to the Rg-Veda Samhitā, page xxxv. 
It should be admitted that the lunar zodiac was pre scientific, i.e., it originated before astronomers became conscious of the celestial equator and the ecliptic, and began to give positions of steller bodies with these as reference planes. The nakşatras give very roughly the night-to-night position of the moon, by indicating its proximity to stars and star-groups. Many of the Indian stațs identified as nakşatras are not at all near the ecliptic or the moon's path which, on account of its obliquity, is contained in a belt within +5° of the ecliptic. Such are for example : 
(15) Svāti, which is identified with Arcturus Ta Bootis), which has a latitude of 31° N. 
(22) Sravana, identified with a, b, y Aquilae, having the latitude of 29€ N. 
(23) Śravişthā, identified with a, b, Y, 8 Delphini, a having the latitude of 33° N. 
(25) Purva Bhadrapada identified with a Pegasi and some other adjacent stars, a Pegasi having latitude of 19° N. 
At one time, the brilliant star Vega (a Lyrae) was also, included making 28. naksatras. But this has a latitude of 62° N and was later discarded. 
No satisfactory argument has been given for the inclusion of such distant stars in the lunar zodiac: The Arabs and the Chinese do not include these distant stars in their lunar zodiac, but 'fainter ones near the ecliptic, Prof. P. C. Sengupta is of the opinion that Indians generally preferred bright stars, but when such were not available near the ecliptic, they chose brighter ones away from the ecliptic, which could be obtained on the line joining the moon's cusps. 
The nakşatras were used to name the 'days' in the earliest strata of Indian literature. Thus when the moon is expected to be found in the Maghā nakşatra (a Leonis), the day would be called the Magha day. This is the oldest method of designating the day, for it is found in the Rg-Vedas. Other methods of designating the day by tithis or lunar days, or by the seven week-days, came later. The system has continued to the present times. In old times, astrology was based almost entirely on the nakşatras, e.g., in Asoke's records, the Puşya nakşatra day was regarded as auspicious when brāhmaṇas and Sramaņas were fed, in order to enhance the king's punya (religious merits). In the Mahābhārata also we find that the days are designated by nakşatras which apparently mean the star or star cluster near which the moon is expected to be seen during the night. 
As is apparent from Table No. 5, the nakşatras are at rather unequal distances, i.e., they rarely follow the ideal distance of 131°. This is rather inconvenient for precision time-reckoning. We find in the Vedānga Jyotişa times an attempt at a precise definition of the two limits of a nalşatra, which was defined as 800' (-13° 20') of the ecliptic. The nakşatra was named according to the most prominent star (Yogntārā) contained within these limits. These are given in. column (2) of Table 5. 
We do not, however, have any idea as to how the beginnings and endings of the nakşatra divisions were fixed in India. The prominent ecliptic stars which were used as Yogatārās (junction-stars) in pre-Siddhāntic period, are not distributed at regular intervals along the ecliptic ; and so it was found very difficult to include the stars in their respective equal divisions. This will be clear from table (No. 5) where the junction stars of the nakşatras according to the Sūrya "Siddhānta are given in col. (2). The celestial longitudes of the stars for 1956 A.D. are given in col. (4) and the beginnings of each division for the same year are given in col. (5), taking the star a Virginis to occupy the middle position of the nakşatra Citrā, which marked

(new-poon ), but every conjunction of the sun and the modn is not the occasion for a solar eclipse: A lunar eclipse takes place only pear opposition (full moon), but every opposition of the sun and the moon is not the occasion for a lunar eclipse. 
In many ancient countries, China and Babylon for example, records of occurrence of eclipses had been kept. The celebrated Greek astronomer, Ptolemy of Alexandria (ca. 150 A. D.) had before him a record of eclipses kept at the Babylonian archives, dating from 747 B. C. They gave date of occurrence, time. and features of the eclipse, whether they were partial or total. From an analysis of these records, the Chaldean astronomers tried to discover the laws of periodicity of eclipses, which ultimately resulted in the discovery of the Saros cycle of 18 years and 10 or 11 days. The basis of the Saros cycle is as follows: . 
We do not exactly know when the ancient astronomers outgrew the myth of demons periodically devouring the sun and the moon during eclipse times, and arrived at the physical explanations now known to every student of astronomy, and reproduced in the diagrams given below. 
But the exact prediction of the day was a nécessity from the socio-religious point of view. In India, the month was measured from full-moon to full-moon, and in the Mahābhārata, the great epic which was compiled from older materials about 400 B. C., it is recorded that sometimes the full moon occurred on the thirteenth day after the new-moon, This was taken to forebode great calamities for mankind. There were similar ideas in Babylon of which Pannekoek says: 
"When the Moon is full on the night of the 14th, the normal time, it was a lucky omen ; when full-moon happened on the night of the 13th, 15th or 16th, it was abnormal, hence & bad omen. Here astrology and calendar were merged ; deviation in the calendar was considered an unlucky, sign and had to be restored at the end of the month.»* 
Neugebauer says : 
"The months of the Babylonian calendar are always real lunar months, the first day of which begins with the first visibility of the new crescent. The exact prediction of this phenomenon is the main problem of the lunar theory as known to us from about 250 B.C. onwards." + 
This is rather comparatively late date. The reason is that the accomplishment of this objective depends on the evolution of methods of exact astronomical observations, and of a method of recording them in precise mathematical language. Some ancient people never reached this stage. As far as we are aware, the ancient Babylonians were the first to evolve methods of observational astronomy. They also arrived at the principles of angular measurements, found the apparent paths of the moon, the sun, and the planets in the heavens, and discovered that it was only the sun's path (the ecliptic) which was fixed, and the paths of the moon, and the planets deviated somewhat from it. How this was done will be related later. 
But even before these accurate methods had been discovered, the Babylonian astronomers had learnt a lot more about the moon from long period observa tions. The most remarkable of these discoveries is that of the Chaldean Saros, or a period of 18 years 101 days, in which the eclipses of the sun and the moon recur. 
The occurrence of solar or lunar eclipses, when the two great luminaries disappear suddenly, either partially or wholly, were very striking phenomena for the ancient and medieval people, and gave rise to gloomy forebodings. There were all kinds of speculations about the cause of the eclipses, e.g., that the sun and the moon were periodically devoured by demons or dragons. The ancient astronomers, however, found that a solar eclipse takes place only near conjunction

But when they arrived at physical explanation of eclipses, they had an understanding as to why there are no eclipses during every full moon and new moon. The paths of the two luminaries must be in different planes. This we take up in a subsequent section more fully, when we describe how the sun's path or ecliptic was discovered. 
Suffice it to say that at some ancient epoch, some Chaldean astronomer discovered that the moon's path was different from the sun's, and therefore cuts the sun's path at two points, now called Nodes. The condition for an eclipse to happen is that the full moon and new-moon must take place sufficiently close to the Nodes, otherwise the luminaries would be too far apart, for an eclipse to take place. 
The Nodes' now take the place of the mythical dra gons which were supposed to waylay the sun and the moon, periodically, and swallow and disgorge them. In Hindu astronomy, the ascending node is called

4.3 THE GNOMON Observations of the positions of the sun, the moon, planets and stars are now made very accurately with elaborate instruments installed in observatories. But these instruments have been evolved after thousands of years of experience and application of human ingenuity, and have undergone radical changes in design and set-up with every great technological discovery. But let us see how the early astronomers who had no instruments or very primitive ones made observations, collected the fundamental data, and evolved the basic astronomical ideas. 
The earliest instrument used-by primitive astrono mers appears to have been the gnomon; which we now describe. 
els 
.lt 
into the gand, might have noticed that its shadow turned around during the day and that it varied in length as it turned. The gnomon in its simplest form was the systematization of that casual experiment. Instead of a spear, a measured stick was established solidly in a vertical position in the middle of a horizontal plane, well smoothed out and unobstructed all around in order that the shadow could be seen clearly from sunup to sundown. The astro nomor (the systematic user of the gnomon deserves that name) observing the shadow throughout the year would see that it reached a minimum every day (real noon), and that minimum varied from day to day, being shortest at one time of the year (summer solstice) and longest six months later (winter solstice). Moreover, the direction of the shadow turned around from West to East during each day, describing a fan the amplitude of which varied througout the year".* 
From the observation of the shadows cast by the gnomon, many useful deductions could be made. These are : 
(1) Mark the points in the morning and in the evening when the shadows are equal in length and draw the lines showing the shadows. Then bisect the angle between the two shadow lines. This gives us the meridian or the north-south direction of the 
· place.. 
The process of bisection was done by taking a rope attaching extreme points to the end points of the equal shadows ; then take the mid-point of the rope, and stretch the rope, and mark the position of the mid-point. This connected to the pole gives us the meridian line. If we draw a circle, with the pole as centre, and draw the meridian, the point where it strikes the northern semi-circle is the North point, opposite is the South point. The' East and West points are found by drawing a line at right angles to the north-south direction. 
So the cardinal directions are found. 
(2) Observe the position of the sunrise from day to day. If observations are carried on throughout the year, there will be found two days in the year when the sun will arise exactly on the east point. Then it is found that the day and night are equal in length. These days are called the Equinoctial days. Let us start from the equinoctial day in Spring (vernal equinox). This happens on March 21st. Then we observe that the sun at sunrise is steadily moving to the north, at first rapidly, then more slowly. Near the extreme north, the sun's movement is very slow, so this point is called the 'Solstice which means the sun standing still. Actually the sun reaches its northern-most point on June 22 (summer solstice). 
Fig. 7-The gnomon 
The ancients determined the latitude of the place, obliquity of the ecliptic, the length of the year and the time of day by measuring the length and direction of shadow of the gnomon, The figure shows the noon-shadow of the gnomon AB, AE being the equinoctial shadow and AC and AD the shadow on 
two solstice-days, at a place on latitude = 0. 
Nobody can fail to see the change in direction and length of shadows of vertical objects throughout the day-time, and throughout the year. When these observations are carefully made, by means of the gnomon ( Banku in Sanskrit ), which is simply a vertical stick planted into the ground, and standing on fairly level ground of large area, without obstruc- tions from any direction, a good deal of astronomical knowledge can be easily deduced. These observations appear to have been made in all ancient countries. 
We have the following description, by George Sarton, of observations made in ancient times in Greece with the aid of the gnomon.* 
"It (the gromon) is simply a stick or a pole planted vertically in the gror or one might use a column built for that purpose or for any other ; the Egyptian obelisks would have been perfect gnomons if sufficiently isolated from other buildings. Any intelligent person, having driven his spear 
* Sarton mentions Anaximander (C. 610-545 B.C.) of Miletus as the earliest Ionian philosopher who used the gnomon in Greater Greece.

The day is longest on this date. Then the sun begins to move south till it crosses the east point on September 23, when day and night again become equal (the autum nal equinox day). It continues to move south, till the extreme south is reached on December 22, (the winter solstice day), when daylight is shortest for places on the northern hemisphere. Then the sun turns back towards the east point reaching it on March 21, and the year-cycle is complete.. 
• The gnomon thus enabled the ancient astronomers (in Babylon, India, Greece, and China) to determine : 
(a) The Cardinal points : East, North, West, and South ; the north-south line is the meridian line (the Yamyottara-rekha in Indian astonomy); 
(b) The Cardinal days of the Year : viz., 
The Vernal Equinox (V.E.) day, when day and night are equal. 
The Summer Solstice (S.S.) day, when the day is the longest for observers on the northern hemisphere. 
The Autumnal Equinox (A.E.) day, when day and night are again equal. 
The Winter Solstice (W.S.) day, when the day is the shortest for observers on the northern hemisphere. 
All early astronomical work was done in the northern hemisphere. 
These methods are fully described in the Surya Siddhānta, Chap. III, but they appear to have been practised from far more ancient times. In the :: appendix (5-C), we have quoted passages from the Aitareya Brāhmana which shows that the gnomon was used to determine the cardinal days of the year at the time when this ritualistic book was compiled. The date is at least 600 B.C., i.e., before India had the Greek contact. It may be considerably older everr. 
(c) To mark out the Seasons : We have mentioned earlier that in countries other than Egypt, there were no impressive physical phenomenon like the arrival of the annual flood of the Nile to mark the beginning of the solar year, or of the seasons. The seasons pass imperceptibly from the one to the other. 
The gnomon observations probably enabled the early astronomers of Babylon and Greece to define the onset of the seasons, and the length of the year with greater precision. 
In Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, we have four seasons : 
Spring ... - from V.E. to S.S. Summer... ... „ Sis. to A.E. Autumn...... , A.E. to W.S. 
Winter. ... » W.$. to V.E. 
Thus, every season starts immediately after a cardinal day of the year and ends on the next cardinal day. 
According to Neugebauer : 
"Babylonian astronomy (during Seleucid periods, 300 B.C.-75 A.D. ) was satisfied with an exact four-division of the seasons as far as solstices and equinoxes are concerned, with the summer solstice ( and not the verna! point ) as the fixed point."* 
At a later stage, they however found that the four seasons had unequal lengths ( vide $ 3.1). 
The above definition of 'seasons' has come down to modern astronomy. The Hindu definition of seasons was different ( vide $ 5.6 and 5-A) 
The observation of the Cardinal days of the year appear to have been carried out all over the ancient world by other methods, and often in a far more elaborate manner. People would observe the day-to-day rise of the sun on the eastern horizon, and mark out the days when the sun was farthest north (summer solstice day), or farthest south (winter solstice day). The time period taken by the sun to pass from the southern solstitial point to the northern solstitial point was known in the Vedas as the Uttarāyana (northern passage), and that taken by the sun to pass from the northern solstitial point to the southern solstitial point was known as the Dakşināyana (southern passage). Exactly midway between these points the sun rises on the vernal and autumnal equinoctial days. From the passage in the Satapatha Brāhmana, quoted later ( vide $5:3), we see clearly that the point on the eastern horizon, where the sun rose on these days, was recognized to be the true east. 
Doubt has been expressed about the ability of Vedic Aryans to make these observations, but to these objections, B. G. Tilak replied in his Orion, pp. 16-17. 
“Prof. Weber and Dr. Schrader appear to doubt the conclusion on the sole ground that we cannot suppose the primitive Aryans to have so far advanced in civilization as to correctly comprehend such problems. This means that we must refuse to draw legitimate inferences from plain facts when such inferences conflict with our precon ceived notions about the primitive Aryan civilization. I am not disposed to follow this method, nor do I think that people, who knew and worked in metals, made clothing of wool, constructed boats, built houses and chariots, performed sacrifices, and had made some advance in agriculture, were incapable of ascertaining the solar and the lunar years. They could not have determined it. correct to a fraction of a second as modern astronomers have done ; but a rough practical estimate was, certainly, not beyond their powers of comprehension." 
The best example of the ability of the ancient people to observe the cardinal points of the sun's motion is afforded by the Stonehenge in the Salisbury plains of England, of which detailed accounts

the book of Job (the Bible) and in Homer. In the last, the star-groups are used by sailors to find out their orientation. Representations of star-groups are found in ancient Babylonian boundary stones of about 1300 B.C. (see Fig. 15). 
. Let us now see how these observations were made.

have recently appeared in Scientific American ( 188, 6-25, 1953 ) and Discovery (1953, Vol. XIV, p.276). 
It is related in these two publications, that not a long time subsequent to 1800 B.C., say about 1500-1200 B.C., the then inhabitants of Britain, who had not even learnt the use of any metal, but used only stone implements, could construct a huge circular area enclosed by large upright monoliths forming lintels and with a horse-shoe shaped central area having its axis in the direction of sunrise on the summer solstice day. It has been proyed, almost beyond any doubt, that the Stonehenge was used for the ceremonial observation of sunrise on this day. Sir Norman Lockyer in 1900 found that the direction of the axis of the horse-shoe actually makes an angle of about 11° with the present direction of sunrise on the summer solstice day. He did not think that it was a mistake on the part of the original builders ; but that on account of the change in obliquity (angle between equator and ecliptic), the present direction of sunrise had changed to the extent of 11° and using the rate of change of obliquity, he could fix up the time of construction at 1800 + 200 B.C. This estimate has been brilliantly confirmed by C14-analysis of some wood charcoal found in the local burial pits which are presumed to be contemporary with the erection of the Stonehenge. 
After this brilliant confirmation of Lockyer's hypothesis, it is hoped that there will be less hesitation on the part of scholars to admit that it was possible for the Vedic Aryans who knew the use of metal and were far more advanced than the stone-age people of Britain, to devise methods for the observation of the cardinal points of the year. 
How did they observe these points ? Probably in the same way as the Britishers of 1500 B.C., by observing from a central place, the directions of sunrise on the eastern horizon throughout the year. The directions of the solstitial rises could be easily marked. Probably the equinoctial points were found by bisecting the angle between these two directions by means of ropes as described in the Sulva-Sūtras.

In the north, a litile high up to our right hand side we cannot fail to observe the conspicuous constellation of seven stars, called in Europe the Great Bear, but in India, the Saptarsi or seven seers. If we observe the heavens 3 hours later, we shall observe that the group has changed its position as shown in Fig. (8). Let us fix our attention on the two front stars (the pointers) of the Great Bear and join a line through them. The line joining these two stars appear to behave like the hands of a watch, for if produced they pass through a star half as bright at some distance, and appear to have revolved about it as centre. This star is called the Pole Star or Polaris, or Dhruva in Sanskrit which means fixed. If we observe throughout the night, we shall find that the Polaris remains approximately fixed, and the line of pointers continues to go round it. The next day, at

8-26 P.M., nearly 24 hours later they are again almost exactly at the same position. 
We naturally come to the conclusion that the whole starry heavens have been rotating round an axis passing through the observer and the Pole Star from east to west, and the rotation is completed in nearly 24 hours (exactly 23h 56m 48 of mean solar time). 
equator, like the parallels of latitude on the earth, are called parallels of declination. A star's parallel of declination is identical with its diurnal circle, 
The great circles of the celestial sphere, which pass through the poles in the same way as the meridians on the earth, and which are therefore perpendicular to the celestial equator, are called hour-circles. Each star has its own hour-circle, which at the moment when the star passes the north-south line through the zenith of the observer, coincides with the celestial meridian of the place, 
Definition of the Poles The celestial poles, or the poles round which the rotation of the celestial sphere takes place may therefore be defined as those two points in the sky where a star would have no diurnal motion. The exact position of either pole may be determined with proper instruments by finding the centre of the small diurnal circle described by some star near it, as for instance, the stars belonging to the Ursa Minor group. Actually the so-called pole star is at present 57 minutes away from the correct position of the pole which is not actually occupied by any star. 
Since the two poles are diametrically opposite in the sky, only one of them is usually visible from a given place : observers north of the equator see only the north pole, and vice versa in the southern hemisphere. The south pole is not marked by any prominent star. 
Knowing as we now do, that the apparent revolu tion of the celestial sphere is due to the rotation of the earth on its axis, we may also define the poles as the two points where the earth's axis of rotation (or any set of lines parallel to it), produced indefinitely, would pierce the celestial sphere. 
4.5 THE APPARENT PATH OF THE SUN IN THE SKY : 
THE ECLIPTIC The apparent path of the sun in the sky is known in astronomical language as the ecliptic. It is a great circle cutting the celestial equator at an angle of ca 231° (exactly 23° 26' 43" in 1955, but the angle varies from 21° 59' to 24° 36'). This is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. 
The ecliptic is the most important reference circle in the heavens, and let us see how a knowledge of it was obtained in ancient times. 
It is obvious that a knowledge of the stars marking the sun's path could not be obtained directly as in the case of the moon ; for when the sun is up, not even the brightest stars are visible. The knowledge must have been obtained indirectly. Early observers were accustomed to observe the heliacal rising of stars, i.e., observe the brilliant stars lying close to the sun which are on the horizon just before sunrise. This must have given them a rough idea of the stars lying close to .the sun's path. From these observations, as well as from successive appearances of the moon on the first days of the month as narrated in $ 4:1, they must have also deduced that the sun was slipping from the west to the east with reference to the fixed stars, and completing a revolution in one year. But how was this path rigorously fixed ? 
It appears that a knowledge of the stars lying on, or close to the moon's path was obtained from observa tions made during lunar, rarely of solar eclipses. 
They must have realized, as narrated in $ 4.2, that during a total lunar eclipse, the moon occupies a position in the heavens opposite the sun, and the stars close to the moon, which become visible during totality, approximately mark out points on the sun's path. So the word 'Ecliptic' which means the locus of eclipses, came to denote the sun's path. 
The two points of intersection of the ecliptic with the celestial equator are called.' respectively the

First point of Aries, and the Först point of Libra. The first point of Aries is the ascending node, when the sun passes from the south to the north; the first point of Libra is the descending node, when the sun passes from the north to the south. We have vernal equinox when the sun is at the first point of Aries, summer solstice when the sun is at the first point of Cancer, autumnal equinox when the sun is at the first point of Libra, and winter solstice when the sun is at the first point of Capricorn. To the origin of nomenclature, we return later. 
The celestial equator and the ecliptic are the most important reference planes in astronomy. The positions of all heavenly bodies are given in terms of these planes, taking the first point of Aries as the initial point. We explain below the scientific defini tions of spherical co-ordinates used to denote the position of a body on the celestial globe. 
TC-Celestial longitude 1 
CS=Celestial latitude=B Let PS cut the ecliptic at B. Then 
rB=Polar longitude or dhruvakn=1 
BS = Polar latitude or vikşepas These last two peculiar co-ordinates, now no long used, were used by the Sūrya Siddhānta to denote sta positions. They have been traced by Neugebauer to Hipparchos five centuries earlier. 
The position of a stellar body may be defined by either its right ascension (a) and declination (8), 
or its celestial longitude(1) and latitude(B). 
The positions of stars in these co-ordinates began to be given from the time of Claudius Ptolemy (150 A.D.) who used them in his Syntaxis. 
4.6 THE ZODIAC AND THE SIGNS The early astronomers must have found that the sun's path in the heavens was almost fixed, while that of the moon, and of the planets, which acquired for astrological reasons great importance from about 1200 B.C., strayed some degrees to the north and south of the ecliptic. 
In case of the moon the deviation from the ecliptic was found to be not much greater than 5°, but some of the planets strayed much more ; in the case of Venus, her perpendicular distance from the ecliptic rises sometimes as high as 80 degrees. So a belt was imagined straying about 9° north and go south of the ecliptic, in which the planets would always remain in course of their movement. This belt came to be known as the 'Zodiac.'

Ecliptic 
Fig. 1C.--Slowing the spherical co-ordinatce of a star.

The complete cycle of this belt was divided into 12. equal sectors each of 30°, and each sector called a "Sign'. The signs started with one of the points of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, and the first sign was called 'Aries' after the constellation of stars within it. The names of the succeeding signs are given in Table No. 8 on the next page, in which : 
The first column gives the beginning and ending of the signs, the vernal equinoctial point being taken as the origin.

Ichthues The sixth column gives the Indian names. The seventh column gives the Babylonian names. 
It can be easily inferred from the table that the names are of Babylonian origin, but their exact significance is not always known. It has been assumed that the symbols used to denote the signs have been devised from a representation of the figure of the animal or object after which the sign has been named, for example, the mouth and horns of the Ram, the same of the Bull, and so on. 
It is seen that Varāhamihira's alternative names given in column (5) are simply the Greek names corrupted in course of transmission and as adopted for Sanskrit ; with the exception of the name for Scorpion, which is given as 'Kaurpa'. This has phonetic analogy with the corresponding Babylonian sign name Akrabu for Scorpion. The purely Sanskrit 'names given in column (6) are all translations of Greek naines with the exceptions of : 
(3) Twins, which become Mithuna or ‘Amorous couple', 
(9) the Archer, which becomes the 'Bow', (10) the Goat, which becomes the 'Crocodile', 
(11) Water bearer, which becomes the 'Waterpot'. Some of them appear to have been translations of Babylonian names. 
The Babylonian names, as interpreted by Ginzel* are given in the seventh column, with their meanings. 
It is thus seen that the names of the zodiacal signs are originally of Babylonian origin. They were taken over almost without change by the Greeks, and subsequently by the Romans, and the Hindus, from Graeco-Chaldean astrology, 
* Ginzel, Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chrono logie, Vol. I, p. 84. 
But why was such an odd assortment of animal names chosen for the Signs'? There have been interesting speculations. The reader may consult Brown's Researches into the Origin of the Primilive Constellations of the Grecks, Phoenicians and Babylonians, London, 1900. 
These signs were taken up by almost all nations in the centuries before the Christian era on account of the significance attached to them by astrologers. In Greece, they were first supposed to have been introduced by the early Greek astronomer Cleostratos, an astronomer who observed about 532 B.C. in the island of Tenedos off the Hellespont who introduced the designation 'Zodiac' to describe the belt of stars about the ecliptic. The twelve 'Zodical Signs' are not known in older ritualistic Indian literature like the Brāhmaṇas. They appear to have come to India in the wake of the Macedonian Greeks or of nations like the Sakas who were intermediaries for trans mission of Greek culture to India. 
Confusion in the starting point of the Zodiac 
The 'Initial Point' of the zodiac should be the Vernal Point or the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, but as will be shown in the next section, this point is not fixed, but moves west-ward along the ecliptic at the rate of approximately 50" per year (precession of the equinoxes). This motion is unidirectional, but before Newton proved it to be so in 1687 from dynamics and the law of gravitation, there was no unanimity even amongst genuine astronomers about the uni-directional nature of precessional motion, inspite of overwhelming observational 
evidences. 
194 
 
The hesitation of the medieval astronomers in accepting precession can be easily understood. Most of them earned their livelihood by practising the 'Astrological Cult which was reared on the basis that the signs of the zodiac are fixed, and coincident with certain star-groups ; but this assumption crumbles to the ground if precession is accepted. But as historical records now show, though astronomers 'had clearly recognized that the initial point should be the point of intersection of the equator and the ecliptic, there was no unanimity even amongst ancient astronomers of different ages regarding the location of this point in the heavens, because it was not occupied by any prominent star at any epoch and the ancients were unaware of the importance of its motion (vide $ 4:9). 
The attention of mankind was drawn in remote antiquity to the five star-like bodies : 
Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn and Mercury. Venus and Jupiter and occasionally Mars are more brilliant than ordinary stars. Sooner or later, it was found that while the ordinary stars remain fixed on the revolving heavens these five stars creep along them, as a modern author puts it, 'like gloro-worms on a whirling globe', each in its own way. Venus appears as a morning and evening star, the maximum elongation being 47o. It early drew the attention of sea-faring people, its appearance on the eastern horizon indicating early sunrise to persons on lonely seas. But it took mankind some time to discover that it was the same luminary which appeared for some period as a morning star, then as an evening star. Its brilliance could not but strike the imagination of mankind. Mercury also appears regularly as morning and evening star, and it must have been discovered later than Venus, but still at such a remote age in antiquity that all traces of its discovery are lost. 
The motion of the brilliant luminary, Jupiter across the sky attracted early attention ; Mars

an older form of Astrology widely found in Vedic India, which centred mainly round the moon, and the lunar wansions, and to a. lesser extent on the sun. The conjunction of the moon with certain nakşatras was considered lucky, others unlucky (vide $ 4:1). 
Planetary Astrology took the world by the storm after 300 B.C. and its influence was strongest during middle ages in Europe, till the rise of rationalism and modern science almost completely undermined this influence. But it still survives amongst the credulous in the West, but to a far greater extent than amongst the eastern nations. 
emerged in Babylonian history from the time of Assyrian supremacy (ca. 1300 B.C.), for these appeared to be linked up with the mysteries of Heaven itself, and the astrologer enjoyed very great prestige amongst the public, for did he not possess the mysterious power of foretelling correctly the dates of eclipses ! 
Here are some of the samples of astronomical omina during the last centuries of Assyrian power (900 B.C.-600 B.C.).

By placiog the sun at the centre and having the earth and the other planets revolve in circles around it, Copernicus (1473-1543) was able to explain the backward motion of the planets among the stars much more simply than in the Ptolemaic system. This is illustrated in the above figure, taken from Pictorial Astronomy, in the case of Mars as seen from the earth. The earth's speed is 184 miles a second while that of Mars is only 15 miles & second. As the earth overtakes Mars, the latter seems to move backward. The direct motion of Mars to the east is shown at positions 1, 2 and 3, backward or retrograde motion to the 
West at 4 and 5, and direct motion to the east again at 6 and 7. 
What was the reason for the strong fascination which man has for astrology ? 
Mankind has always a psychological weakness for omina, i.e., some signs which can predict future events, good or bad. The older form of omina were rather crude, viz., flight of certain birds like the crow, or movements of animals like the jackal or the snake, howlings of certain birds and animals. In many countries, sheep and goats were sacrificed to gods on the eve of great enterprises, and Augurs claimed to be able to interpret the intentions of the gods from an examination of lines and convolutions on the liver of the sacrificial animal ( Hepatoscopy ). Meteorological phenomona such as a lightning discharge, haloes round the moon, aurora were also regarded as ‘omens'. 
The older forms of omina were all apparently very crude compared to planetary omina which gradually 
"Mars stands in Scorpio, turns and goes forth with diminished brilliancy"; "Saturn has appeared in the Lion" ; "Mars approached Jupiter"; and so on. 
There is not a trace of scientific interest in these texts ; the mind of the reporters is entirely occupied by the omens : When such or such happens, 
“it is lucky for the king, may lord”; or, "copious foods will come" ; "there will be devastation" ; "the crops will be diminished”; "the king will be besieged" ; "the enemy will be slain" ; 
there will be raging of lions and wolves" ; "the gods intend Akkad for happiness" ; 
and so on. 
Yet, with all those observations, these reports represent is considerable astronomical activity. For the first time in historý a large number of data on the planets had been

collected ; it implies a detailed knowledge of facts about their motion."* 
The huge temples, called Ziggurats, ruins of which have been found in Mesopotamia, are supposed to have been dedicated to the planetary gods, each storey being assigned to a particular god. It was the duty of temple priests to keep the planets under observation, and record their positions on the only writing material available then viz., člay-tablets. Hundreds of thousands such clay tablets have been discovered in the ruins of Ziggurats, royal palaces and libraries, and patiently interpreted by western scholars like Kugler. .

Regularities were not sought for ; but regularities imposed themselves, without giving surprise. They aroused certain expectations. Expectation is the first unconscious form of generalized knowledge, like all technical knowledge in daily life growing out of practical experience. Then gradually the expectation develops into prediction, an indication that the rule, the regularity, has entered consciousness. In the celestial phenomena the regularities appear as fixed periods, after which the same aspects return. Knowledge of the periods was the first form of astronomical theory».*

(2), not being ordinary mean solar days, are 'saura days' of Indian astronomy, a saura day being the time taken by the sun to move through one degree by mean motion, or 360 saura days = 365.2422 mean solar days. This explanation has been found by 
O. Neugebauer (vide his Exact Sciences in Antiquity). Most of these data were known to Hipparchos and also to Geminus, a Greek astronomer, who flourished about 70 B.C.

Probably the first stage was to determine the angular distance of heavenly bodies from some 'Normal Stars' as indicated by Sachs. These normal stars were stars either on the ecliptic, like Regulus, Spica, or a Librae or some other stars close to it. Sachs gives a list of 34 such normal stars. Probably the

The early astronomers probably observed that the bright stars Regulus (a Leonis ), Spica (a Virginis), the conspicuous group Pleiades, and certain fainter stars a Librae, a Scorpii were almost on the sun's path. The ecliptic could be roughly constructed by joining these stars. 
'Regulus' or a Leonis was the 'Royal Star' in Babylonian mythology. In Indian classics, it is known as Maghā (or the Great ) and the presiding deity is Indra, the most powerful Vedic god. It is almost exactly on the ecliptic. Citrā ( or a Virginis ) is 2° to : the south. 
The First Point of Aries :-The first point of Aries is the fiducial point from which all astronomical measurements are made. But how was this point, or any other cardinal point, say the first point of Cancer. ( summer solstice ), the first point of Capricornus. ( winter solstice ) and the first point of Libra, were located on the circle of the ecliptic in early, times ? 
For rarely have the first point of Aries nor any other of the cardinal points been occupied by prominent stars during historical times. Even if for measurement, the ancient astronomers used some kind of astrono mical instrument, say the armillary sphere, it would be difficult for them to locate the first point of Aries correct within a degree.

science, the use of astronomy for perfecting the calender appears in the West to have come to a stop after the Seleucidean era. For Rome conquered the whole western Asia up to the Euphrates by about 80 A. D., and the Julian calendar replaced the Babylonian luni-solar calendar, which have, however, .continued to currency probably in limited regions like Syria, Arabia and Iraq amongst certain communities. The Sassanid Persians also followed their own solar calendars inherited from Acheminid times. But the elements of the Chaldean luni-solar calendar have been used in a limited way, for the Christian ecclesiastic calendar for Christianity arose in Palestine and Syria, and the most important event in Christ's life, His crucifixion, is recorded in terms of the luni-solar calendar prevalent in Palestine about the first century A.D.

4.8 GREEK CONTRIBUTION TO ASTRONOMY 
The ancient astronomers were interested primarily in the moon and the planets but later about 150 B.C., Hipparchos gives lists of fixed stars as well with their positions. 
It was clearly observed that though these planets keep near the ecliptic, they deviate by small amounts sometimes to the north, sometimes to the south. In the case of the moon, the maximum deviation amounts to nearly 50 (inclination of the moon's orbit to the ecliptic). In the case of planets, excepting in the case of Mercury and Venus, the deviation was not large. 
In the case of the moon, a knowledge of the moon's celestial latitude was necessary for prediction of eclipses and therefore both the celestial longitude and latitude used to be recorded by the Chaldean astro nomers of the Seleucidean period. In the case of planets, only the celestial longitude appear to have been used. 
The Chaldean astronomers were the first to frame lunar and planetary ephemerides (i.e. calculation in advance of lunar and planetary positions—the pre cursor of modern Nautical Almanacs and Ephemerides) from about 500 B.C. But during these times, neither the knowledge of the sphere nor of spherical or plane trigonometry had developed. The Chaldeans had only developed the ideas of angular measurement which they expressed in degrees, minutes and seconds, the whole circle being divided into 360° degrees. Their methods, which have been elucidated by Neugebauer, Sachs and others were arithemetical. They took maximum and minimum values of astrono- nomical quantities, and interpolated for an inter mediate period, assuming the change to be linear (zigzag function, vide Neugebauer, Exact Sciences in 
Antiquity, Chap. V, Babylonian Astronomy). 
It was the Greeks who introduced geometrical methods to deal with positions of heavenly bodies, and made the next great advance in astronomy. But they developed trigonometry only to a rudimentary stage vide 8 4.8). But they also used Babylonian arithmetical methods alternately. Thus while Ptolemy uses the trigonometric chord functions in bis Syntaxis, in the astrological text, called Tetrabiblos, he uses the Babylonian arithmetical methods. 
Though the calendar, as we have seen, gave the first stimulus for the cultivation of the astronomical 
It has been considered neccessary to give a short account of Greek contributions to astronomy, because there is a widespread view that it was Grezk astro nomy which formed the basis of calendar reform in India which took place about 400 A.D. ( Siddhanta Jyotişa calendar). Let us see how far this view is correct. The Greeks themselves appear to have made no use of astronomy for the reform of their own calendars, as was done later in India. They cultivated astronomy partly as pure science, partly as an indispensable adjunct to astrology. 
It is now well-known that Greek civilization had a long past going back to at least 1500 B.C. The remains of this civilization have been found in Crete (Minoan), and on the Greek mainland itself (Mycenean). Inscriptions have been found in strange scripts (Linear A, and B) which defied decipherment till 1952. We have therefore as yet no knowledge of the calendar in the Mycenean age of Greece (1400 B.C.—1000 B.C.). but probably they will now be forthcoming. 
The Homeric poems 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey' written about 900 B.C., as well as Hesiod writing about 700 B.C. show considerable acquaintance of stars and constellations needed for sea-faring people, to find out their orientation when out at sea. 
From about 750 B.C., the Greek city-states began to emerge ; they were engaged in maritime trade over the whole Mediterranean basin. These activities brought them into contact with many older nations who had attained a high standard of civilization, ë.g., the Egyptians, the nations of the Near East, vex., the Lydians, the Phoenicians, and the Assyrians and imbibed many elements of their civilization. The older Greek scholars themselves admit that the Greeks 
ere 
202 
 
borrowed tþeir script* from the Phoenicians, their coinage from the Lydians, their preliminary ideas of geometry from the Egyptians and of astronomy from the Chaldeans. But they enriched all these sciences beyond measure by their own original thoughts and contributions. As Plato (428-348 B.C.) proudly remarks : "...whatever the Greeks acquire from foreigners, is turned by them into something nobler." 
Greek science goes no further back than Thales of Miletus (624-548 B.C.), who is reckoned to be the first of the seven sages of Greece. Considerable knowledge of astronomy and physics was ascribed to him by later writers. He is supposed to have predicted the occurrence of an almost total solar eclipse, which occurred on May 28, 585 B.C., on the basis of his knowledge of the Chaldean Saros. These stories are now disbelieved by scholars well versed in Assyriology, for according to their finding, the Chaldeans them selves before 400 B.C., had no knowledge of the Saros of 18 years 10% days used later to predict the eclipses, but they used other methods with only partial success. Thales might have used one of these methods, but not certainly the Chaldean Saros. Considering the crude state of Greek civilization in Thales' times, these scholars think that it is a fairytale of modern times that Thales knew anything about the Saros. Thales lived in a coastal city of Asia Minor which had active contact with the great civilizations of the Near East, and probably much of the knowledge ascribed to him were picked up from Babylon and Egypt. 
The next figure in Greek astronomy is Anaximander, (610-545 B.C.), likewise of Miletus a junior contem porary of Thales, who is said to have introduced the . use of the gnomon ( vide 43). This may be conceded, .but this practice was derived most probably from the Chaldeans, who used the gnomon from much earlier times.. Cleostratos ( 530 B.C.) of Tenedos was cited by later authors to have introduced the knowledge of the zodiac, of the eight-year cycle of intercalations in Greece, but probably he merely transmitted the Babylonian knowledge and practice. Meton of Athens is said to have introduced the nineteen-year cycle of 7 intercalary months in Athens in 432 B.C., but as remarked earlier, its use in Greek calendars cannot be dated before 342 B.C., though it was known in Babylon from at least 383 B.C. The question of priority of this discovery is still to be decided, probably by fresh finds and interpretation of ancient astronomical recordin' 
* It appears that the Greeks of Homeric poems used linear A and B, but about 900 B.C., they borrowed the simpler Phoenician script and' adopted it to their use by the addition of vowels. Therekiy they forgot their old script and history, which became myth and legend. The decipherment of Minoan Linear B has been. achieved in 1952 by Ventris and Chadwick. 
We have besides philosophers of the: Pythagorian school (500-300 B. C.), a religious brotherhood which cultivated geometry, astronomy, physics and mathematics. . They are cited by later writers to have propagated the view that the earth. was a sphere, and the planets were also spherical bodies like the earth, but it is difficult to state when, and on what grounds these theories were first propounded. 
These were the periods of tutelage. Greek genius in astronomy began to flower only after 400 B.C., and was aided by a number of causes. 
The first was the development of geometry as a science by philosophers of the Pythagorean school (500-300 B. C.), and other scholars, notably Hippocrates of Chios ( 450-430 B.C.), and. Democritos of Abdera ( 460-370 B.C.). A great impetus to both plane and solid geometry was given by Plato ( 428 348 B.C.), famous philosopher and founder of a school of studies and research known to the world as the Academy'. Plato counted amongst his contem poraries and juniors several geometers of distinction, vix., Archytas of Tarentum (first half of fourth century B.C.), Theaitetus of Athens (c. 380 B.C.), Eudoxus of Cnidos ( d. 355 B.C.), and several others. All th: geometrical knowledge developed by these and other scholars was compiled, and rewritten into a. logical system with rich contributions of his own by Euclid, who lived in the Museum of Alexandria ( 280 B.C.), and was bequeathed to the world in thirteen (or fifteen ) books known as the Elements of Euclid, which have remained to this day the basis of the teaching of elementary geometry. There is no other book of science which have remained current and authoritative for such a long stretch of time, now extending over two thousand years. 
The second factor was political. During the sixth and fifth centuries before Christ, the Greek savants and scholars had indeed undertaken educational journeys to the Near East in search of knowledge --journeys which were made possible and safe under the orderly regime of the Acheminid empire (Persian). But it was the conquest of the Persian empire by Alexander of Macedon in 330 B.C., which rendered these contacts easier and more fruitful. The Greek successor dynasties, vix., the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt, and the Seleucid dynasty in Babylon and other dynasties in Asia Minor were all great patrons of learning and encouraged and maintained scholars ; the former set up the famous Museum at Alexandria, which was. a research institution with a great library, an observatory and other necessary equipment. It attracted scholars from all parts of Greater Greece and provided them with free board, lodge and a salary. This place nurtured a number of great Greek,geniuses : 
CALENDARIO "ASTRONOMY 
203 
Euclid; already mentioned ; Eratosthenes who first measured correctlý the diameter of the earth and was the founder of scientific chronology ; and others whom we shall meet presently. 
On the Asiatic side, under the centralized rule of the Seleucids, the later Chaldean and Greek astrono mical efforts became very much intermingled. A Chaldean priest, Berossus, who lived during the reign of the second Seleucidean king Antiochos Soter ( 282-261 B.C. ), translated into Greek the standard Chaldean works on astronomy and astrology. The period from 340 B.C. to 150 A.D. may be called the most flourishing period of astronomical studies in antiquity. The Chaldeans figured prominently during the earlier part of this period but their methods were based on a primitive form of algebra and arithmetic. According to Neugebauer, their contri butions in mathematics and astronomy were as good as those of the contemporary Greeks who used geometry, but they gradually faded into obscurity on account of their infatuation with astrology ; and the Greeks, though they were great believers in astrology, freed themselves at least from astrolatry, and cultivated astronomy as part of astrology, and emerged as leaders in astronomical science. 
The earliest Greek astronomer to use geometrical ideas in astronomy is, if we leave aside the Pytha goreans, probably Eudoxus of Cnidos ( d. 355 B.C.), a junior contemporary, friend and pupil of Plato. He made great original discoveries in geometry, and Books V and VI of Euclid are ascribed to him. It was probably his knowledge of geometry which led him to make the first scientific attempt to give a geometrical explanation for the irregular motions of the sun, the moon, and the planets. Twenty-seven spheres, all concentric to the earth were needed to account for these motions. This theory had but a short life, but it is remarkable as the first instance, when heavenly bodies, connected with great gods, were treated on a human level. 
Eudoxus is supposed to be the inventor of geometrical methods for determining the sizes and distances of the sun and the moon, usually ascribed to Aristarchus of Samos (fl. 280 B.C.), who is known to have taught that the daily revolution of the celestial sphere was due to the rotation of the earth round its axis. He is also said to have first put forward the heliocentric theory of the universe. Neither of these theories was accepted the contemporary astronomers. The world had to wait for the appearance of a Coper nicus (1473-1543), for the acceptance of these views. 
Apollonius of Perga (born avout 262 B.C.). kpown more for his treatise on Conics, originated the theory 
of epicycles, and eccentrics to account for planetary motion. He was a júnior contemporary of two great figures : Eratosthenes already mentioned and Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 B.C.), a great. figure in mechanics, hydrostatics and other sciences, but to astronomy, he is remembered as originator of the idea of Planetarium-a revolving open sphere with internal mechanisms with which he could imitate the motions of the sun, the moon, and the five planets. 
Archimedes is also credited with attempts for finding out the actual distances of the planets from the earth. We do not know whether this is correct or not, but about this time, we find the planets arranged accord ing to the order of their distances from the earth : 
Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn or if we take the reverse order : 
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. This last order was taken up by astrology and formed the basis of the seven-day week, which came into vogue about the first century A.D. 
. The greatest name in Greek astronomy is Hipparchos of Nicaea, in Bithynia who settled in the island of Rhodes and had an observatory there (f. 161-127 B.C.). He probably corresponded with the savants at the Museum of Alexandria. Not much of his writings have come down to us, except through quotations and remarks by Claudius Ptolemy, the famous Alexandrian astronomer who flourished three centuries later. Sarton writes about Hipparchos : 
"It is possible that all the Ptolemaic instruments, except the mural quadant, had already been invented by him (e.g. diopter, parallactic and meridian instruments). He was the first Groek observer who divided the circles of his instru ments into 360 degrees. Ho constructed the first celestial 
globe on record. 
He used and probably invented the stereographic projection. He made an immense number of astronomical observations with amazing accuracy" 
The principle of measurement of angles was certainly derived from the Chaldeans. Hipparchos gave 'à catalogue of 850 stars with their positions, which is reproduced in Ptolemy's Syntaxis. Vogt found that of the 471 preserved numbers giving position, 64.are declinations, 67 are right ascensions, 340 are in polar longitudes and latitudes, which reappear in the Surya Siddhānta, six hundred years later. 
It is suggested that after his discovery of precession (vide $ 4.9 ), Hipparchos probably used celestial longi tudes and latitudes. But these co-ordinates bad been already used by the Chaldeans at least a century earlier, 
Hipparchos, had probably some knowledge of plane and spherical trigonometry necessary for the solution 
C. R. – 34 
204 
 
of astronomical problems, e. g., finding out the time of rise of zodiacal signs during the year, a problem of great importance to horoscopic astrology. It is the current opinion that he used the double chord, illustrated below : 
Chord (2 a)=2 R Sin a 
R 
Fig. 20 and gave a table of double-chords from 0° to 90°, which was later improved by Ptolemy in his Syntaxis. It is suggested by Neugebauer, that the 'Sine function' (Jya in Hindu astronomy) was introduced 600 years later by Aryabhata, and replaced the double chord. The Hindu astronomers used Utkramajyā which is the ver sine function, 1-cos a, but do not appear to hate used the cosine function as such. Neither the Greeks nor the Hindus used the tangent, and the cotangent, which were introduced by Arab astronomers about the ninth century (al-Battānı, 858-929 A.D.), and were known in Latin in early days as Umbra Versa, and Umbra Extensa (extent of shadow ) respectively. These are reminiscent of the practice of designating the zenith distance Z of the sun by the length 1 of the shadow of the gnomon, l=p tan 2, p being the height of the gnomon. 
Between Hipparchos and Claudius Ptolemy (150 A.D.), who lived at the Alexandrian Museum from 128 A.D. to 151 A.D., there is a gap of 300 years, which saw the phenomenal rise of horoscopic astrology. There are, however, very few great names in astronomy. Menelaos, a Greek astronomer who lived in Rome about 98 A.D., laid the foundation of spherical trigonometry, but it was confined to a transversal proposition from which Ptolemy deduced solutions for only right angled spherical triangles, of which either two sides or an angle and one side are given. The Hindu astronomers likewise used only solutions of right angled spherical triangles. The discovery of general relations in spherical triogenometry was the work of Arabic astronomers (al-Battani). 
Claudius Ptolemy who worked at Alexandria between 128-151 A.D., was, as Sarton says, a man of the Euclidean type. Great equally as an astronomer, mathematician, geographer, physicist, and chronologist, his main work is the great mathematical and astro Domical treatise known in Greek as 'Syntaxis', and in 
Arabic translation as the Almagest. It has been long supposed that it rendered all previous treatises in astronomy obsolete, and remained a standard text, which fertilized the brains of all ancient and medieval astronomers, Greek, Jew, Arab, and European, till the rise of the heliocentric theory of the universe rendered it obsolete. This opinion appears to have been rather exaggerated. Strangely enough, the Syntaxis appears to have been quite unknown to Hindu astronomers of the 5th century A.D. 
Ptolemy's chief contribution to astronomy was his elaborate theory of planetary motion and discovery of a second inequality in the motion of the moon, now called. Evection. He gave a catalogue of 1028 stars with their positions, most of which have been shown to have been taken from Hipparchos by adding 30 to the longitudes given by him. This represents the shift of the first point of Aries since Hipparchos's time according to Ptolemy's calculation. The actual value is 4o. 
Ptolemy wrote a treatise on astrology known as the “Tetrabiblos" which long remained the Bible of the astrologers. 
After Ptolemy, there were no great figure in astronomy except few commentators and workers of mediocre ability like Theon of Alexandria (about 370 A.D.), who initiated the false theory of trepidation of the equinoxes, and Paulus of Alexandria (fl. 378 A.D.) who wrote an 'astrological introduction. He is supposed to have been the inspirer of the Indian Siddhanta known as 'Paulisa' Siddhanta (vide $ 56), but this hypothesis started by Alberuni has never been proved. With the advent of Christianty, and after murder of the learned Hypatia (415 A.D.), the 'light' goes out of Greece. 
The Greek contributions to astronomy are : 
A geocentric theory of the universe, with the planets in the order given on page 203. 
The treatment of planets as spherical bodies similar to the earth. 
Geometrization of astronomy, development of the concepts of the equator, the ecliptic and of spherical co-ordinates (right ascension and declination, celestial latitude and longitude), some elementary know ledge of plane and spherical trigometry to deal with astronomical problems. 
Knowledge of planetary orbits, and attempts to explain them with the aid of epicyclic theories.

4.9 DISCOVERY OF THE PRECESSION OF 
THE EQUINOXES 
In the previous sections, we have stated how the Chaldean and Greek astronomers started giving 
CALENDARIO ASTRONOMY 
205 
but is subject to variations which we may disregard at this stage. The shift is accumulative and in 100 years would amount to 1° 24', and in about 26000 years the first point will go completely round the ecliptic. The period depends upon certain factors and is not constant. 
The tropical year, or the year which decides the recurrence of seasons, is the time-interval for the return of the sun in its orbit, starting from the year's vernal equinoctial point to the next vernal equinoctial 
tropical year would be the same as the sidereal year, which is the same as the time of revolution of the earth in its orbit. But since the vernal equinoctial point slips to the west, the sun has to travel 360° 0' 01-50" =359° 59' 10" to arrive at the new vernal equi noctial point, hence the duration of the tropical year is less than that of the sidereal year by about 20 minutes. In exact terms : duration of the sidereal year = 365.25636 mean solar days 
, , tropical. = 365.24220 at the present time. 
Further Consequences of the Precession 
of the Equinoxes We may now consider some consequences of the 
positions of planets, and stars, with the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator—the first point of Aries-as the fiducial point. We shall now relate how the discovery was made that this point is not fixed in the heavens, but has a slow motion along the ecliptic to the west at the rate of ca. 50" per year. The rate is very small, but as it is unidirec tional and cumulative, it is of immense importance to astronomy, and incidentally is very damaging to astrology. 
When the sun, in course of its yearly journey arrives at the first point of Aries, we have the vernal equinox. The first point of Aries is therefore also called the vernal point. 
The position of the vernal point has rarely in the course of history, been occupied by a prominent star, but in India, as narrated in $ 5:4, its nearness to star groups as well as the nearness 'of other cardinal points to star-groups have been noted from very early times. Traditions of different epochs record different stars as being near to the cardinal points. But nobody appeard to have drawn any conclusion from these records (vide for details $ 5:4). 
In Babylon also, different sets of positions of stars and planets record Aries 15°, Aries 10°, and Aries 8° (the zero is of Ptolemy's) as being the vernal point. But no Chaldean astronomer to our knowledge appears to have drawn any conclusion from these data. 
The first astronomer known to have drawn attention to the precession of the equinoxes was Hipparchos. He particularly mentions that the distance of the bright star Spica (a Virginis or Citrā). has shifted by 2o from the autumnal equinoctial point since the time of his predecessor Timocharis who observed at Alexandria about 280 B.C. He concluded that the autumnal point, and therefore also the vernal point, was moving westward at the rate of 511 seconds per year. 
• It is not known whether Hipparchos considered the motion as unidirectional. It was impossible for him to say anything definite on this point, as obeservations extending over centuries are required to enable one to make a definite statement on this point. 
Though Hipparchos made, as time showed, one of the greatest astronomical discoveries of all times, which is all-important for the calendar, as well as for astronomy, its great importance does not appear to have been realized by either his contemporaries or followers for thousands of years. 
Let us, therefore, dwell a little on the consequences of this discovery.' Later and more accurate observa tions have shown that the rate is nearly 50° per year, 
Hipparchos appears first to have marked out the 
· beginning of the astronomical first point of Aries. It started go west of the star a Arietis. Ptolemy had found that it had shifted by his time by about 30, and gave the rate of precession as 36" per year. In this, he was wrong, the true shift being about 4'. Ptolemy in his 'Uranometry' gives the starting point of the sign of Aries as 6° to the west of ß Arietis, and the other constellations' marked at intervals of 30° may be marked out on the zodiac. The picture (Fig. 19) gives the boundaries of the different signs according to Hipparchos. The boundaries of the signs of Ptolemy would be 4o to the west of those of Hipparchos. 
By the time of Ptolemy, (and probably much earlier), a complex system of astrology had developed which connected men's destiny in life with the position of planets in the different signs at the time of his birth (horoscopy). It was claimed that even 
calculated in advance from planetary positions in the signs. Though a few rational men like Seneca and Cicero were as much sceptical about the claims of astrology as the modern man, the general mass became converted to its claims, even astronomers not excepted. Even the great Ptolemy wrote a treatise "The-Tetrabiblos' exposing the principles of Astrology. 
206 
 
·In fact, belief in astrology was one of the main incentives for the observation of the positions of heavenly bodies in ancient and medieval times which were carried out by medieval astronomers with so much zeal under the willing patronage of influential persons. 
The discovery of precession is very disconcerting to astrologers, for in the astrological lore, the signs are identified with certain fixed star-clusters ; whereas precession tends to take them entirely out of these star-clusters. Thus since Hipparchos's time, the shift has been nearly 30 degrees, and what was the sign of Pisces in Hipparchos's time has now become the sign of Aries, and the astronomical sign of Aries has now nothing to do with the Aries constellation, 
This consequence must have been foreseen by the followers of Ptolemy, and they probably started, more on psychological than on scientific grounds, to find out theories to mitigate the devastating influence of precession on astrology. Astronomers immediately following Ptolemy barely mentioned precession. It was first referred to by Theon of Alexandria (ca. 370 A.D.) who invented the theory of Trepidation, i.e., he said that the precessional motion was not unidirec tional, but oscillatory. He gave the amplitude of oscillation as 8o. Probably this figure was suggested 
\- Ptolemy's Almagest into Arabic ; he noted precession, 
but upheld the theory of trepidation. But the other great Arabic astronomers like al-Fargbani (861 Baghdad), al-Battāni (858-Syria), Abd al-Rabanān al-Şafi (903-986-Teheran) and Ibn Yonus (d. 1009– Cairo), all noted precession and rejected the theory of trepidation. In fact al-Battani gave the rate of precession as 54" per year, which is far more correct than the rate given by Ptolemy, viz., 36" per year. 
But unfortunately, Europe recovering from the slumbers of dark ages were more influenced by the Spanish-Muslim astronomers al-Zarquali (1029-1087 of Cordova). and al-Bitruji (ca. 1150, living at Seville), who upheld. the theory of trepidation. As their influence was considerable, they were largely responsible for its diffusion among the Muslim, Jewish and Christian astronomers, so much so that Johann Werner (1522) and Copernicus himself (1543) were still accepting it ; Tycho Brahe and Kepler had doubts concerning the continuity and regularity of the precession, but they finally rejected the trepidation. The theory of trepidation was completely given up in Europe after 1687, when Newton gave a physical explanation of it from dynamics and the law of gravitation. This is given in appendix (4-A), for the benefit of Indian astrologers and almanac-makers who still believe in the theory of trepidation and oppose reform of the wrong calendar they are using for centuries. 
Sarton from whose writings much of this account has been compiled, writes* :: 
"The persistence of the false theory of trepidation is difficult to understand. At the very beginning of our era, the time span of the observations was still too small to measure the procession with precision and without ambiguity, but as the centuries passed there could not remain any ambiguity. Between the stellar observations registered in the Almagest and those that could be made by Copernicus, almost fifteen centuries had elapsed, and the difference of longitudes would amount to 210" 
Aries had shifted by a little less than 80 from Hipparchos's position, and Theon thought that it would go back and save astrology. 
Proclos the successor (410-485. A.D.), head of the Platonic Academy at Athens, a very learned man and one of the founders of Neoplatonism, denied the existence of precession! 
After the sixth century A.D, the dark age set in Europe and the mantle of scientific investigation fell on the Hindus and the Arabs. Let us see how the Arab astronomers regarded the precession.

the top falls down ; the processional motion of the top is due to the pull exerted by the gravity. 
Now turning to the earth, we see that as a first approximation, wo may take it as a point of mass concentrated at the centre, and then deduce its orbit as is done in classical planetary theory. This would have been all right, if the earth wero a homogeneous sphere. But the earth is not & sphere, but a spheroid, having its polar axis shorter than the equatorial axis by 43 kms. (= 27 miles). There is an oquatorial bulge of matter. The pull due to the sun, is now equivalent to a force in the ecliptic passing through the centre of the earth defining the orbital motion, plus a couple, which tends to turn the equator of the earth into the plane of the ocliptic. It is this couple which produces precessional motion. 
For details of calculation the reader may refer to a book on Rigid Dynamics, say A. Webster, Dynamics, pp. 298-302. 
We mention only the results here :

we get the progressive part of the solar precession 
=246 10–18, 
This is in radians per second of time. To convert it to seconds of arc per year, we have to multiply the expression by 2.063 x 108 x 3.156 X 10". 
2.063 X 10% being the number of seconds of angle in a radian, and 3.156 x 107 the number of seconds of 
time in the year. We have therefore the rate of solar precession 
=16."0 por year. We have now to calculate the action of the moon which, in spite of its much smaller mass, exerts & far larger perturbing force as the lunar distance is much smaller. In fact the tide raising force (mm) for the moon is more than double that of the sun. This makes the rate of lunar precession=34".4 per year. 
But there is another complication. The moon's orbit is not coincident with he sun's path (ecliptic) but is inclined at an average angle of 5° 9', the extreme values being 5° 19' and 4° 59'. Further the points of intersection of the moon's orbit with the ecliptic travel round the ecliptic in a period of 18.6 years. The pole of the moon's orbit M therefore moves round the pole of the ecliptic C as shown in fig. 24 in a period of 18.6 years. The lunar precessional angle Won has therefore to be defined from the instantaneous position of M. 
Combination of the two precessional motions. 
The two precessions can be combined as in fig. 24. Hero C, M are the polés of the ecliptic and of the moon's orbit: P is the celestial pole. The solar procession can bio

Annual Rate of Precessional Motion 
The solar and lunar processions amount to 50.937 per tropical year, with a very small centurial variation. After making necessary corrections for the slight motion of the plane of the ecliptic due to attraction of planets, the annual rate of general procession in longitude is obtained as follows : 
Rate of procession=50."2564+0."0222 T per trop. year, where T=Tropical centuries after 1900 A.D. 
The putation in longitudo may amount to +17.''2 according to different positions of the lunar node, but its effect on the annual rate of precession does not exceed £5."8, so that the actual precession rate per year may vary between 44."5 to 56."0. 
The average rate of annual precession is not constant, it is very slowly increasing. The annual rate for certain epochs along with the period taken by the equinoxes to move through 1°, are however stated below :

CHAPTER V Indian Calendar 
TURY 
successive streams between 2500 B.C. and 1500 B.C. Others would go further back in time-scale from certain astronomical evidences. 
5.1 THE PERIODS IN INDIAN HISTORY The time-periods in Indian history necessary for our purpose are shown in the Chronological Table. 
The earliest civilization so far discovered in India is the Harappa-Mohenjo-Daro civilization (sometimes also called the Indus-Valley civilization) named after the two ancient buried cities of Harappa in the Punjab and Mohenjo-Daro in Sind. They were first brought to light by the late R.D. Banerjee, Superinten dent of the Western Circle of Archaeology of India in 1924. · It has now been ascertained that this civilization extended right upto Rupar on the Sutlej in the east and to the Narmada valley in the south. This civilization was certainly contemporaneous with the Mesopotamian civilizations of about 2500 B.C., nearly 500 years before the city of Babylon had risen to supremacy amongst the cities of Sumer and Akkad ; and with the first dynastic civilization of Egypt. How far back it projected into the time-scale is not yet known, but certainly many thousand years back. 
From the material records of the Indus-valley civilization, it is obvious that the Harappa-Mohenjo Daro people had attained to as high a standard of civilization, if not higher, as the contemporary people of Iraq and Egypt. But the script has not yet been deci phered ; it is therefore difficult to give a chronological history, but it is not so difficult to make a study of the attainments of this civilization is arts and sciences ; they could build well planned cities, used a drainage system superior to that of contemporary Egypt or Iraq, used copper and bronze, and had evidently evtoved a highly complex social organization. 
All civilized communities have been found to have evolved accurate systems of weights and measures and -some kind of calendar for the regulation of social life. We have some evidences of the use of standard weights and measures in the Indus valley. 
But had they evolved a calendar ? The presump tion is that they must have, but nothing has yet been discoverd amongst the artefacts left by these people so far recovered by the Archaeological Survey which tbrows light on the..calendar, or the system of time measurement they used 
It is held on quite sound grounds that the Harappa Mohenjodaro people were succeeded in the Punjab and in the valley of the now lost Sarasvati river by the Aryan people who were either autochthonous or more probably came through Afghanistan in single or 
: Few, almost none of the materi 
artefacts of the early Aryans except some potteries tentatively ascribed to them, have so far been discovered. Almost the whole of our knowledge about them are derived from the hymns of the Rg-Vedas which were composed by priestly families amongst them in an archaic form of Sanskrit (Vedic Sanskrit), in honour of the gods they worshipped ; in these hymns are found occasional references to the sun, the moon, certain stars, and to months and seasons. Some think that there are also references to planets, i.e., the Vedic Aryans could distinguish between fixed stars and planets, but this is doubtful. From certain references which we discuss in $ 5.2, we may conclude that they used an empirical luni-solar calendar. Probably this was used till 1300 B.C. We do not come across sufficient material records until we come to the time of Asoka about 270 B.C. 
What was the calendar during the period 1330 B.C.-250 B.C.? The Yajur Veda, the Brāhmaṇas, the Upanişads and other post Rg-Vedic literature, and the early Buddhistic literature contain occasional astronomical references, from which the nature of the calender used for ceremonical and other purposes can be inferred. The interpretation of the texts is neither easy, nor unambiguous. The latter part of this period has been called by S. B. Dikşit, our pioneer in calendar research, as the Vedānga Jyotişa period. This is discussed in § 5.4. 
The Vedanga Jyotişa calendar appears to have been almost completely free from foreign influence, though this point of view has been contested. The Persian conqueror Darius conquered Afghanistan, and Gandhar, about 518 B.C. ; this region appears to have continued under the Achemenids for nearly two centuries. The Achemenids used a solar calendar probably adopted from Egypt in contrast to the luni-solar calendar of India, but this does not appear to have disturbed the indigenous luni-solar calendarical system. 
The Vedanga Jyotişa period, which as we shall show, was continued by Indian dynasts up to the time of the Satavahanas (200.A.D.), was succeeded by the Siddhānta Jyotişa period, but the first record of this period is available only about 400 A.D. "The transi

tional period from 100 A.D. to 400 A.D. is one of the . darkest periods in Indian chronology. Due to successive invasions by Macedonian and Bactrian Greeks ( Yavanas ), Parthians (Pallavas ), Saka's and Kuşānas, the period from 300 B.C. to 200 A.D. is one of large foreign contacts which profoundly modified Indian life in arts, sciences, sculpture and state-craft. But the history of this period was entirely forgotten and is being recovered bit by bit from inscriptions, foreign references, and from artefacts recovered in excavations of the sites occupied by invaders of this period. Let us give a bird's eye view of the history of this period, imperfect as it is, so that the reader may follow without strain our account of the transition of the Vedanga Jyotişa calendar to Siddhāntic calendar. 
In 323 B.C., Alexander of Macedon raided the Punjab, but this incident by itself had no such profound influence on Indian life as is generally made out. Its influence was rather indirect. In India, it gave rise to a great national movement of unification under Candragupta and Canakya. In the former empire of Darius, it gave rise to a number of Greek states which became the focus of radiation of Greek culture throughout the East. The most important were Egypt under the rule of the Ptolemies, with capital at Alexandria, and the Near East under the Seleucids with capital at Babylon, which was succeeded a few years later by Seleucia a few miles distant from later Baghdad. In 306 B.C., Candragupta ind Seleucus faced each other, but the Greek army was rolled back to the borders of modern Iran, and almost the whole of modern Afghanistan except Bactria (modern Balkh) constituting the four satrapies of the old Persian empire were ceded to India. They continued to be politically and culturally parts of India till the tenth century A.D. 
(175-150 B.C.), who controlled the whole of Iran and wrested Bactria from the line of Eukratidas in 138 B.C. 
But inspite of these political happenings, Greek remained the language of culture throughout the whole Near East, from Asia Minor to North-Western. India. The Parthians since 128 B.C. called themselves 'Philhellens' or lover of Greek culture and used Greek on their coins, and the Graeco-Chaldean method of date-recording on their inscriptions. But about 140 B.C., a new power was on the move, viz., the Sakas from Central Asia ; they began to emerge as a ruling race from about 138 B.C. In 129 B.C. they attacked Bactria, and by 123 B.C. they wrested it completely out of the Parthian empire, after defeating and killing on the battlefield two successive Parthian emperors, vix., Phraates II (128 B.C.) and Artabanus I (123 B.C.). 
The early Śakas appear from their coins to have been under the spell of Greek civilization, and used Greek as a language of culture and put motifs taken from Greek mythology on their coins. Pressed by the next Parthian emperor, Mithradates II (123—90 B.C.), they poured by 80 B.C.,. into the whole of what is modern Afghanistan, except the Kabul valley, which the Greeks held for sometime. Their new territory became known as "Sakasthan' comprising modern Afghanistan and parts of N.W. India. From Afghanistan, they poured in successive streams to Malwa, Guzrāt, Taxila about 70 B.C., and to Mathura, somewhat later and had put an end to the numerous Greek principalities in the Punjab. Their further progress was barred by the Satavahanas in the South, and numerous small kingdoms which arose in the Gangetic valley on the break-up of the Sunga and Kanva empires (45 A.D.). After 50 A.D., the Sakas of the North were supplanted by the Kuşānas belonging to a kindred race, and speaking the Saka language ; they ruled Northern India from their. capitals at Peshawar and Mathurā up to at least 170 A.D. Contemporaneously with them, were the Saka Satrap houses of Ujjain, who started ruling from about first century of the Christian era. 
. A chart of these historical incidents is attached for the sake of elucidation as they are necessary for the comprehension of the extent and amount of Greek culture, which was propagated into India, not so much through the Greeks directly, but as it appears now, indirectly through the early Śakas and their successors, the Kuşānas. 
It now appears very probable that it was during the regime of the Saka and Kozana rulers (100 B.C. 200 A.D.) that a knowledge of the Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, which had developed in the Grecian world after 300 B.C. and ended with the astronomer 
The Mauryas kept out the Greeks till 186 B.C., when on the break-up of their empire, the Greek settlers in Bactria who had revolted from their overlords, the Seleucids, began to make inroads into India. There were two rival Greek houses, the earlier, the Euthydemids who under Demetrius and Menander (175 B.C.) took possession of the Punjab and Sind between 180 B.C. to 150 B.C. and threatened even Pataliputra but were rolled back beyond the Jamuna by the Sungas ; the line of Eukratidas who ousted Demetrius and his line from Bactria and Afghanistan propter about 160 B.C., reigned in Afghanistan up to 50 B.C. But there rose about 226. B.C., a great barrier between the Eastern Greeks (Bactrians and Indian Greeks) and the Western Greeks in the shape of the Parthian empire (248 B.C.), which became very powerful under Mithradates I 
214 
 
Ptolemy (150 A.D.), and in the Near East under the Seleucids (300 B.C. to 100 A.D.), penetrated into India, being brought by astronomers belonging to the Saka countries, who later were absorbed into Indian society as Śakadvipi or Scythian Brahmins. The borrowings appear to be more from Seleucid Babylon than from the west. The knowledge of Graeco Chaldean astronomy was the basis on which the calendar prescribed by the Surya Siddhānta and other Siddhäntas were built up. It completely replaced the former Vedānga Jyotişa calendar and by about 400 A.D, when the Vedānga Jyotişa calendar had completely disappeared from all parts of India. 
From 400 A.D. to 1200 A.D., almost the whole of India used calendars based on Siddhanta Jyotişa for date-recording. All Indian astronomers used the Saka era for purposes of accurate calculations, but its use for date-recording by kings and writers was generally confined to parts of the South. In general, the Indian dynasties used eras of their own, or regnal years, though the annual calendar was compiled according to rules laid down either in the Surya Siddhānta, the Arya Siddhānta or the Brahma Siddhānta. These did not much differ in essentials. 
When India since 1200 A.D. fell under Islamic domination, the rulers introduced the lunar Hejira calendar for civil and administrative purposes as well. Indian calendars were retained only in isolated localities where Hindus happened to maintain their ndependence, or used only for religious purposes. The emperor Akber in 1584 tried to suppress the Hejira calendar for administrative purposes by the Tarikh-Ilahi, a modified version of the solar calendar of. Iran, but this fell in disuse from about 1630., Since the advent of British rule in 1757, the Gregorian calendar has been used for civil and administrative purposes, which is still being continued. 
We have attempted to give below short accounts of calendars in use in different epochs of history.

· ning theological matter, particularly observations on 
sacrifices and their mystical significances ; attached to the Brāhmanas, but reckoned also as independent works are the Aranyakas or Upanişads containing meditations of forest hermits and ascetics on God, the world, and mankind. These treatises are attached to each of the individual Vedas. 
(c) The Sutras or Aphorisms, or Vedangas. 
Vedängas', lit. limbs of Vedas, are post-Vedic Sūtra or aphorism literature which grew as results of attempts to understand the Vedas in their various aspects, and sometimes to develop the ideas contained in the Vedas. According to the orthodox view, there are six Vedāngas as follows: 
(1) Śikṣā : or phonetics; texts explaining how the Vedic literature proper is to be pronounced, and memorized. 
(2) Kalpa : or ritualistic literature, of which four types are known : Srauta Sutras dealing with sacrifices ; Grhya Sutras dealing with domestic duties of a householder ; Dharma Sūtras dealing with religious and social laws; Sūlva Sūtras dealing with the construction of sacrificial altars. 
(3) Vyakarana i or Grammar, e.g., Panini's famous Aştādhyāyī, which once for all fixed up the Sanskrit language. The Aştādhyāyi is however the culmination of attempts by large number of older authors, whose works were rendered obsolete by Panini' masterpiece. 
(4) Nirukta or Etymology: explanation of the Vedic words ascribed to one Yaska, who lived before Pānini. 
(5) Chandas-Metrics ascribed to Pingala. 
(6) Jyotişa-Astronomy: the Rg-Jyotişa is ascribed to one Lagadha, of whom nothing is known. 
Only the sixth Vedanga or Jyotisa interests us, though there are occasional references to the calendar in all Sätra literatures. 
Age of the Vedic Literature * 
5.2 CALENDAR IN THE RIG-VEDIC AGE 
( -1200 B.C.) The Vedic Literature : The knowledge of the calen dar in this age can be obtained only from the Vedic literature which consists however of different strata, greatly differing in age. According to the great orientalist Max Muller four periods each presupposing the preceding can be distinguished. They are : 
(a) The Chandas and Mantras composing the Samhitās or collections of hymns, prayers, incantations, benedictions, sacrificial formulas, and litanies 
The above gives the 'Philologists' stratification of the age of the Vedic literature. About the actual age of each strata, there is great divergence of opinion, though it is admitted that the oldest in point of age are the Samhitās, then come the Brāhmaṇas and 
* Much of the substance-matter of this section is taken from Winternitz': A History of Indian Literature Vol. 1, published by the University of Calcutta. Chap. I, on Vedic Literature. 
INDIAN CALENDAR 
215 
Upanişads, next the Sutras or the Vedangas. Of the four Vedas, the Rg-Vedas are by common consent taken to be the earliest in age and as Winternitz remarks, though all subsequent Indian literature refers to the Rg-Vedas, they presuppose nothing extant. 
· Max Muller made a rough assignment of age to the different strata as follows on the assumption that the Brahmanic and Upanişadic literature predated the rise of Buddhism, and that the Sutra literature which may be synchronous with the Buddhistic literature may be dated 600 B.C. to 200 B.C. Working backwards he assigned the Brāhmanic literature to 600 B.C. to 800 B.C., the interval 800 B.C. to 1000 B.C. 
· as the period in which the collections of hymns were arranged, and 1000 B,C. to 1200 B.C, as the period of the beginning of Vedic poetry. He always regarded these periods as terminus ad quem, and in his Gifford Lectures on Physical Religion in 1889, he expressly states "that we connot hope to fix a terminus a quo. Whether the Vedic hymns were composed 1000, 1200, 2000 or 3000 years B.C., no power on earth will ever determine. * 
It is not correct therefore to say, as some people say, that Max Muller had proved that 1200-1000 B.C. is the date of the Rg-Vedas. † 
. Other authorities, Schrader, Tilak, Jacobi, and P. C. Sengupta have found much older age for Rg-Vedic Indians : in fact, even as early as 4000 B.C., for some incidents described in the Rg-Vedas.* But their arguments, being based on interpretations of vague passages assumed to refer to astronomical phenomena have not commanded general recognition. 
Let us first look at the strata within the Rg-Veda itself. The Rg-Vedas are divided into 10 Mandalas (lit. circles ) or books. Of these, the 2nd to the 8th books are ascribed to certain priestly families, e.g, the 2nd book is ascribed to Gritsamadas, the 3rd to the Visrāmitras, etc. These are agreed to be the oldest parts of the Vedas. 
The ninth book is devoted to Soma which is an intoxicating drink pressed out of a plant. The drink was dear to the Aryans and is also mystically identified with the Moon. 
The first and the tenth books are miscellaneous collections ascribed to different authors. They are taken to be the latest in age. 
The Rg-Vedas consist of 1028 hymns, containing over 40,000 lines of verses. 
The Vedas are regarded as 'Śrulis' or "revealed knowledge preserved by hearing." According to savants, they were the outpourings of the heart and mind, of ancient priestly leaders, to their gods which were mostly forces of nature, intermingled very often with secular matter. Priestly families were trained to memorize the texts and pass them on to succeding generations in ways which guaranteed their transmi ssion without error or alteration of the text. Savants are almost unanimous in their opinion that the Rg-Vedic texts which were composed in an archaic form of Sanskrit, which was not completly understood even in 500 B.C,, have come to us without change. The orthodox Indian view that they are revealed knowledge is of course not shared by scholars, both eastern and western, who point out that very often in the text of the Vedas themselves and in Anukramanis or introductions to texts, the authors of each hymn are mentioned by name and family.. 
To which locality are the Vedas to be ascribed ? 
As regards locality, they are certainly to be ascribed to parts of Afghanistan, east of the Hindukush and the Punjab. The rivers of the Punjab, the Indus and its tributaries on both sides and the now lost Sarasvati are frequently mentioned, the Ganges only once in a later text. The authors call themselves Aryas or Aryans, in contrast to the Däsas or Dasyus who were alien to them, and with whom they came in frequent clash. The Dasyus are now taken to be partly Indus valley people, partly aboriginals. 
The Rg-Vedas describe a highly complex society of priests, warriors, merchants and artisans, and slaves but the rigid caste system had not yet developed. There are also references to cities, but no artefacts except some pottery, have yet been discovered. which can be referred to the Rg-Vedic Aryans. 
The Rg-Vedic Aryans, it appears, were con temporaneous (if not older) with the great civilizations of Mesopotamia, both Sumerian, and later Accadian, and according to one view, some of the royal families of Asia Minor, were probably 'Vedic Aryans'. It is therefore quite probable that they had attained as high a stage of civilization as that of Egypt of the Pyramid builders (2700 BC.), or of Sumer and Accad under Sargon I. 
Let us see what information we can gather about the calendar which they must have used for no civilized community can be without a calendar. 
* For details about Vedic antiquity, see Ancient Indian Chronology by P. C. Sengupta. 
+ It appears that Max Mūller has been a bit dogmatic in his opinion. Shortly after his death the names of the Vedic gode, Indra, Varuna, Mitra and the Nāšatyas in their Rg-Vedic forms were discovered in the Hittite clay tablets discovered at Boghaz Kuei in Asia Minor. They have been assigned to about 1450 B.C. More evidences about the Vedic Aryans were discovered in the excavations in the Sarasvati valley now being undertaken by the Archaelogical Dept. of the Govt. of India. Further, fresh evidences are expected also in the archaelogical work undertaken in Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia.

Translation: Twelve spoke-boards: One wheel : three pavels. Who understands these? In these there are 360 sankus (rods) put in like pegs which do not get loosened". 
Further, the whole life of Vedic Aryans was centred round sacrifices to their great gods ; and sacrifices had to be carefully timed with respect to seasons, and moon's phases. In fact, some sacrifices were year-long, as Dr. Martin Haug, the great Vedic scholar remarks in his introduction (p. 46) to Aitarcya Brāhmana (affiliated to the Rg-Veda). 
"The Sattras (or sacrifices) which lasted for one year, were nothing but an imitation of the sun's yearly course. They were divided into two distinct parts, each of six months of thirty days each ; in the midst of both was the Visuvān, j.l., equator, or central day, cutting the whole Sattra into two halves". 
This refers to somewhat later times than the Rg-Veda, but even during these early times, the sacrificial cult was fully developed. Let us see what references we get about the calendar from the Rg-Vedic times. 
The year is compared to a revolving wheel, whose circumference is divided into 12 parts (twelve months). They are grouped into three navels (seasons). 
Here also we have a year of 360 days, divided into 12 months, four months constituting a season, as we find in the oldest inscriptions. 
If the interpretation of the last passage is correct, we have the earliest reference to the later cãturmāsya system, or division of the year into three seasons each of four months. 
It appears from these passages that Vedic Aryans had once a year of 360 days as ancient Egyptians also had, but they discovered later that this was not the correct value either for 12 lunar months, or for a seasonal year. For the following reference shows that they used also a thirteenth month. 
Ķg-Veda, 1. 25.8 Veda māso dhỉtavrato dvādaśa prajāvataḥ 
vedāya upajāyate. Translation : Dhrtavrata ( Paruņa ) knows the twelve months : (and) the animals created during that period; (and) he knows (the intercalary month) which is created (near the twelve months). 
This passage makes it clear that the calendar was luni-solar. But how was the adjustment made ? 
A hymn in the Rg-Veda first noted by Tilak comes to our help. 
Calendaric and Astronomical References 
in the Rig Vedas These are few, and interspersed along with other matter. This is not to be wondered at, for the hymns are addressed chiefly to the gods, Agni (sacrificial fire). Indra (the national warrior god), etc., and other references are only incidental. The direct references are found only in Books 1 and 10 which are later in age than the family books. 
Let us give the texts of a few hymns and their translations in English. 
Rg-Veda, 1.164.11 Dvada sāram nabi tajjarāya varvarti cakram 
paridyāmộtasya A putrā agne mithunāso atra sapta satāni 
vimšatisca tasthuh. Translation: The wheel (or time) having twelve spokes revolve round the heavens, but it does not wear out. Oh Agni !. 720 pairs of sons ride this (wheel). 
Here the year is likened to a wheel, having 12 spokes for months); the 720 pairs of sons are 360 days and nights. 
The interpretation commonly accepted is that the year was taken to consist of 360 days divided into 12 months, and the night and the day (following or preceding) constitute a couple.

According to Tilak, the Kbhus are the genii of seasons. They are said to enjoy the hospitality of the sun for twelve days in the above verse. This passage, according to Tilak means the adjustment of the solar 'year with the lunar (sie., 366-354-12 days).* 
* cf. Ancient Indian Chronology, Chapter VI. 
INDIAN CALENDAR 
27 
Another hymn from Atharva Veda (4.11.11) states that: 'Prajapati, the lord of yearly sacrifices after finishing one year's sacrifice, prepared himself for the next year's sacrifice'. 
The sacrificial literature of India still preserves the memory of these days by ordaining that a person wishing to perform a yearly sacrifice should devote 12 days (dvādaśāna) before its commencement to the preparatory rites. 
Did the Rg-Vedic Aryans have any knowledge of the lunar zodiac, or designate the days by the lunar mansions, as we find widely prevalent during later times ? 
There is no explicit reference to this point, but words which are now used to denote the lunar mansions are found in several verses of the Rg Vedas, e.g., 
Citra (a Virginis) is mentioned in RV. 4-51-2 
Magha (a Leonis ) is mentioned in RV. 10-85-13 but in these passages the meaning of these words is not very clear. 
The following references are more explicit. 
Atharva Samhita, 14.1.13 Sūryāyā vahatuḥ prāgāt savitā yam avāspjat Maghāsu hanyante gāvah pbalganipu vyuhyate. 
Translation : The first line is identical. In the second line, the only change is Maghā for Agha, and Phalguni for Arjuni. In the lunar zodiac, Magha stands for lunar asterism No. 10, of which the chief star is a Leonis. The two Phalguni stars, Uttara Phalguni (No.12) and Purva Phalguni (No. 11) stand for ß Leonis and & Leonis. 
This verse shows that the custom of designating the day (it means day and night) by the lunar asterism in which the moon is found in the night, which is found widely in vogue in later times, and is used even to-day for religious purposes, was in use at the time when this hymn was written. The practice therefore 
dates earlier than 1200 B.C. at least. 
Rg-Veda, 5.54. 13 Yuşmā dattrasya Maruto vicetaso rāyaḥ gyáma rathyo vayasvataḥ na yo yucchati tişyo yathā divo'sme rāranta Marutah sabasriņań. 
Translation : You wise Maruts, we would like to be disposer of the wealth conferred by you on us ; it should not deviate (from us) as Tişya does not deviate from the heavens. 
Here one is tempted to identify the word 'Tisya' with the lunar asterism of that name, viz., Puşya (8 Cancri). 
The following reference is more explicit. 
Longer periods of Time : The Yuga 'Yuga' is a very common word used in Indian literature of all times to denote an integral number of years when certain astronomical events recur. It exactly corresponds to the Chaldean word 'Saros' which has gone into international vocabulary. In later Indian literature we have Yugas of all kinds the five yearly yuga, sixty yearly yuga, and Mahāyugas of 4:32 x 106 years. Was any Yuga, known in Rg-Vedic times ?' 
There is evidence that some kind of a short period yuga, probably the five yearly yuga of later times, in which the moon's phases roughly recur, and which was the chief theme of the Vedānga Jyotişa was known in Rg-Vedic times as the following quotation shows : 
Rg-Sainhetā, 1.158.6. . Dirghatamā māmateyo jujurvān daśame yuge apāmartham yatinām Brahmā bhavati sārathih 
Translation : Dirghatamā the son of Mamatā having grown old in the tenth yuga became the charioter of the karma which leads to semi-result. 
The most rational explanation of the word yuga here is probably the five yearly yuga of Vedānga Jyotişa for it is rational to expect that a man becomes old after he attains the 50th year. But there have been other explanations. 
The Seasons and the Year The most commonly used word for year in the Indian literature is Varşa or Vatsara. The word 
Versa' is very similar to Varşā, the rainy season, and is probably derived from it. But curiously enough, this word is not found in Rg-Vedas. But the words Śarad (Autumn), Hemanta (early Winter) etc., are very often found to denote 'seasons" and sometimes years, 
Rg-Veda, 10. 85. 13 Sūryāyā vahatuh prāgāt savitā yamavāsșjat Aghāsu hanyante gāvo'rjunyoḥ paryuhyate. 
Translation: The (dowry) of cows which was given by Savita (Sun) had already gone ahead of Surya. On the Agha-day, the cattle were slain (acc. to Sayana had departed), on the two Arjuni-days, she was led to the bridegroom's house. 
This passage occurs in the famous bridal hymn, where the Sun god (Savitr) gives away his daughter Suryā to Soma (Moon) in marriage. It says that on the Agħā-day the cows, given as bridal dowry are, driven away ; on the two Arjuni-days, the bride goes to the bridegroom's house. 
This hymn is repeated in the Atharva Samhita as follows:

The month-names which are given here and repeated in many other verses of the Yajur Veda have been interpreted by all authorities to be tropical. Further this is probably the earliest mention of month names in Indian literature ; these names are no longer in use, and have been replaced by lunar month-names (Castra, Vaisakha, etc.) which are, however, found at a later stage. 
Madhu and Madhava have been taken in later literature to correspond to the time-period when the sun moves from -30° to 30° along the ecliptic, and so on for the other months. But we have no reason to believe that the Yajurvedic priests had developed such a fine mathematical sense of seasonal definition. But it is almost certain that they must have developed some method of observing the cardinal points of the sun's yearly course, viz., the two solstices and the equinoxes. From these observations, they must have counted that the number of days in a year was 366 in round numbers. 
The Yajur-Veda speaks in many places of the Utlarāyana, the northernly course of the sun from winter solstice to summer solstice and the Dakşināyana or the southernly course from summer solstice to winter solstice and the Vişuvān, or the equinoctial point. The ayanas or courses must have received their designation from daily notings of sunrise on the eastern horizon. The year-long observation of shadows cast by a gnomon, of which we have evidences, may have formed an alternative method for fixing up the solstitial days, and the.cardinal points on the horizon, (vide Appendix 5-C), where some passages from the Aitareya Brāhmana attached to the Rg-Veda are stated in favour of the view that the cardinal points were observed by means of the gnomon. 
Once they learnt to anticipate the cardinal days, determination of the month-beginnings marking seasons would not be difficult. The Madhu-month (the first month of spring) would begin 30 or 31 days before the vernal equinox day or 61 days after the winter solstice day, and the Madhava month on the day after the equinoctial day and so on. Average length of 303 days (909) would be given to each month, or 30 and 31 days to the two months forming a season. 
There are several points to be noticed in this list, which may be compared with the list given on p. 210. 
First, the nakşatras start with Krttikās which all authorities identify with the conspicuous group Pleiades. What is the significance of this ? 
At the present times, the naksatras start with Asvini, of which the junction star is a or B. Arietis. This custom, Ašvinyādi, was introduced in Siddhanta Jyotişa time ( 500 A.D.), when the astronomical first point of Aries was near the end of the Revati nakşatra ( $ Piscium ), or the beginning of Afvini. We do not enter into the controversy about the exact location of this point by the Siddhanta astronomers, which is fully discussed in Appendix 5-B. At present, the astronomical first point had shifted by as much as 19° from Š Piscium, but the orthodox Indian calendar makers do not admit in the continued precession of the equinoxes, and still count the nakşatras from Atvini. 
In all older literatures, on the other hand, including the great epic Mahābhārala, whose composition or compilation may be dated about 400 B.C., the first nakşatra is Krttikā, It therefore stands to reason to assume that at one time, when the nakşatra enumeration started, the Pleiades were close to the astronomical first point of Aries, or rose near the true east. This is implied in the following verse which S. B. Dikşit picked out of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa : 
Šatapatha Brāhmana, 2.1.2. Ekam dve triņi catvārīti vā anyāni nakgatrānyathaitā eva bhūyiṣṭhā yat kfttikā.... Etā ha vai prācyai digo na cyavante Servāni ha vã anyũni nakgatrani 
prācyai dišaścyavante. Translation :--Other nakşatras have one, two, three or four ( stars ) only ; these Krttikās have many ( stars )... They do not deviate from the east; all other nakşatras deviate from the east. 
The names as given in this list are somewhat different from those now adopted, which have come into vogue since 500 A.D.; for example, we have : 
No. 6 Tişya for Puşya No. 16 Rohini for Jyestha ( There are thus two Rohinis, No. 2, and No. 16). No. 17 Vicrtau for Mula No. 20 Srona for Sravana No. 21 Śravistha for Dhaniştha No. 23 Proşthapada for Bhadrapada No. 26 Aśvajuya for Asvini 
No. 27 Apabharani for Bharani . The more important question is whether the lunar mansions denote definite clusters of stars, or the nakşatra-divisions of later times amounting to 13° 20' Or 800 minutes ? This point has been discussed in 8 4'1.

The Nakshatras 
One of the peculiar features of the Indian calendars is the use of the Nakşatras as explained in $ 4'1. Evidences have teen given that the custom started from Rg-Vedic times. But we come across a full list of Nakşatras only in the Yajurveda' with names of presiding deities as given in Table No. 10 (p. 220 ), taken from Dikşit's Bharatiya Jyotisastra.

taken as consecrated from the very beginning of the year. But such people have to accept one "nirya' ( draw back ), viz., that the Visuvān* occurs in the cloudly season ( sammedhya ). Hence, one should consecrate on the Citrä full-moon day. The Citrā full moon month is the 'mouth of the year. 
From these passages, we learn that the lunar month came gradually. The ancient Indians reckoned by the pakşa or the fortnight, and distinguished the closing full moon day of the pakşa by the nakşatra where the moon was full. Thus Phälguni Paurņamāsi is that full moon when the moon gets full near the Uttara Phalguni star (B Leonis ), one of the lunar mansions. Caitri Paurņamāst is that full moon, when the moon gets full near the Citrā star (a Virginis ), which is the 14th lunar mansion. Later, as the months were always full-moon ending, the word paurņamāsi was dropped, and, e.g., the first part of Caitra-Paurna māsi, i.e., Caitra became the lunar month-name. The above passage says that the Phālguna Paurnamāsi was regarded as the last day of the year and less frequently the Caitra Paurņamāsi. This system still continues, and the first lunar month Caitra of the lunar year begins on the day after Phalguni Paurņamāsi. 
There are twenty-seven nakşatras and so only 12 can be selected for lunar month-names. 
The twelve names which we have got are : Caitra

is completed when the moon is ahead of the sun by 12°, or integral multiples of 12° ( vide $ 57). 
Thus the first tithi ( Pratipada, lit, when the moon. is regenerated ) in the waxing half starts when the moon is in conjunction with the sun, and ends when she has gone ahead of the sun by 12°, when the second tithi of the waxing moon begins. The tithis are numbered ordinally from 1 to 15, the end of the fifteenth tithi being full-moon. Then begins the tithis of the waning moon, numbered from 1 to 15, the end of the 15th tithi being the new-moon. There are thirty tithis in a lunar month, and though the average duration is less than a solar day, being 23.62 hours, the length of individual tithis may vary from 26.8 to 20.0 hours., on account of irregularity in the moon's motion. 
This is the definition of the tithi given in Siddhāntas or scientific astronomy which started about 400 A.D. But this presupposes knowledge of measure ment of angles, and precise scientific observation, of which we find no trace in the Vedic literature. What was then the origin of this system ? 
We have no reference to tithi in the Rg-Veda. The first reference is found in Yajurvedic literature, and the Brāhmaṇas. The Taittiriya Samhita talks of the pancadasi tithi, which shows that the lunar pakşa was divided into 15 tithis, counted by ordinal numbers from 1 to 15 for each pakşa. But what was the time period meant by a tithi ? The Aitareya Brāhmana attached to the Rg-Veda gives the following definition of the tithi. 
Aitareya Brāhmana, 32.10 
· Yām paryastamiyad abhyudiyāditi så tithih. 
The tithi is that time-period about which the moon sets or rises. 
This has been interpreted by Prof. P. C. Sengupta as follows: 
During the waxing moon ( śukla pakşa ), the tithi was reckoned from moon-set to moon-set ;, and during the waning moon ( krsna pakşa ), the tithi was reckoned from moon-rise to moon-rise. The tithis were thus of unequal length, as shown by Prof. P. C. Sengupta in Table No. 11 on page 222. 
Of course, full moon takes place by turn in all the nakşatras. But only 12 at approximately equal intervals could be selected. But we have too Rauhinya paurņamāsi etc. the pakşa when the moon becomes full near Rohini, or Aldebaran ( lunar mansion No. 4). But Rauhinya' was not selected for the name of a lunar month, because it was too near Krttikā-Paurņa māsī.

The history of the Indian calendar from the end of the Yajurveda period to the beginning of the Siddhanta Jyotişa period is very imperfectly known though there are plenty of calendaric references in the Brāhmanäs, Sūtras, and the epic Mahābhārata and various literature. On time-scale, it extends from

an unknown antiquity, which is set by some at 1300 B.C. to 900 A.D. 
The Vedanga Jyotupa is generally assigned to this period. It may be said to be a sort of collection of short aphorisms giving mathematical rules for fixing the calendar in advance, and is known in three versions : the Rg-Jyotişa consisting of 36 verses, attached to the Rg-Veda and ascribed to one Lagadha 
as mentioned earlier, the Yājuş Jyotiņa attached to the Yajurveda and consisting of 43 verses, and there is a text ascribed to one Somakara, a commentator of unknown age of the Vedas. The dffferent texts contain about the same matter, but the verses are haphazardly arranged showing that the original texts have not come down to us in an unadulterated form. The number of independent, verses in all the versions 
INDIAN CALENDAR 
223 
is not more than 49, and some of the verses have not been interpreted. 
There are several other calendarical treatises which can be assigned to this period. The Surya Prajnapti, a Jaina astronomical work, the Jyotisakaranda, and the Kalalokaprakaša. 
A short account of the calendaric rules followed in these treatises is given in Varāhamihira's Pañca Siddhāntika, Chap. XII, where the rules are collected as "Paitāmaha Siddhānta" or Astronomical Calendar according to Grandfather Brahma, the Creator, in Hindu mythology. That shows the high antiquity of the rules. Varāhamihira, as well as Brahmagupta describe the rules as very "inaccurate" (Daravibhrastau, furthest from truth in Varahamihira's language) though they pay a formal courtesy to the supposed authors. But such has been the case with calendars of all ancient nations, including the Babylonians at this period and a critical account of the Vedānga Jyotişa is important from the historical point of view. 
It may be remarked here that there are minor differences between Vedānga Jyotişa, the Jain systems, and the Paitāmaha Siddhanta, which appear to be the latest of this group. The older treatises have a year of 366 days, while the Paitamaha Siddhanta has a year of 365-3569 days (Dıkşit). 
There is an extensive literature on Vedanga Jyotoşa which has been studied by Dr. G. Thibaut, S. B. Diksit, S. K. Pillai, and Dr. R. Shama Sastry, amongst others. We hiere give an account of the calendar according to the Paitāmaha Siddhanta. 
The Vedānga Jyotisa further describes measure ments of the subdivisions of the day by means of the clepsydra, as well as by gnomon-shadows. 
One particular feature is the assumption that the ratio of the length of the day to that of the night on the summer solstice day is as 3.: 2. 
Let us now examine these points critically. 
We observe that all the mathematical rules point out only to mean motions of the sun and the moon, i.e, the periods of the sun and the moon were obtained by counting the number of sāvana days in a large number of years and months, and dividing the number by the number of periods (year or month). No evidence is found of the systematic day to day observations of the sun and the moon. Only the lunar zodiac was used for describing the positions of the sun and the moon, which appears to have been divided into 27 equal parts or nakşatras ; in other words the nakşatras no longer denoted star-clusters but equal divisions of the lunar belt. 
There is no mention of the zodiac or twelve signs of the zodiac, or of week days, or of planetary motion, 
Let us now look critically into the rules.. 
5 solar years. = 365.2422 x 5-1826.2110 days; 62 synodic months=29.53059 x 62-1830.8965 days ; 67 sidereal months=27.32166 x 67=1830.5512 days. 
Summary of the Contents 
"Five years constitute a Yuga or Saros of the sun and the moon. 
The yuga comprises 1830 sāvana days (civil days) and 1860 tithis (lunar days). 
In the yuga, there are 62 lunar months and 60 solar months. So two months are omitted as intercalary. months, in a period of 5 years. 
The number of omitted tithis in the period is 30. 
There are 67 naksatra-months (sidereal months) in the yugu The moon passes through 67 x 27=1809 nakşatras within this period.. 
The yuga begins at winter solstice with the sun, and the moon together at the Dhanişthā asterism (a or B Delphini)." 
These are the main points from which the five yearly calendar can be constructed. 
Therefore, regarded as a measure for luni-solar adjustment, the error is 4.685 days in a period of 5 years, i.e., if we started a yuga with the sun and the moon together on the winter solstice day, the beginning of the next yuga (6th year) would occur. 4.685 days later than the winter solstice and in 5 to 6 yugas the discrepancy would amount to a month or half season. This cannot escape notice, and therefore there must have been some way of bringing back the yuga to the winter solstice day. Otherwise the calendar becomes useless. But how could it have been done ? . This is a matter for conjecture and several hypotheses have been proposed. According to S. B. Dikşit, we should have in 95 years : 
according to the V. J., x 95-38 intercalary months, while actually we have, I'o x 95-35 intercalary months. 
So the Vedanga Jyotişa rules introduce 3 more intercalary months than necessary in 95 years, and if these are dropped, we can have good adjustment. This could have been done as follows : 
In the first period of 30 years-6 yugas, suppose they had 11 intercalary months instead of 12. 
The beginning of the yuga would go ahead of the winter solstice in 30 years by 4685 X6-28.110 days. 
224 
 
The mistake was .000305 days on the lower side of 1 nakşatra in 3279 days or about 9 years. 
But if we do not have the intercalary month on the 30th year, the "yuga-beginning is brought back to 29.53–28.110- 1.421 days before the W.S. day. The same process is repeated for the next period of 30 years. The yugd-beginning is thus brought back to 2.842 days before the W.S. day. 
The next period may be taken to consist of 35 years, i.e., 7 yugas each of five years, in which the yuga beginning goes ahead by 3.264 days. The combined result of the three periods of 30, 30, and 35 years is to put the yuga beginning ahead of the W.S. day by 0.422 days only. Other conjectural cycles are described by Dr. Shama Sastry. 
But was any such practice really followed ? We have no evidence from the verses ; but S. B. Diksit mentions that intercalary months were inserted only when needed, and hence probably they were 'dropped when not needed.' 
Tithis The main object of the Vedanga Jyotişa calendar appears to have been the correct prediction of the tithi and nakşatra on any sāvana (civil) day within the yuga. In this respect, the rules were more accurate. A tithi is defined as asth of the lunar month. The correct measure is 
1 tithi - 29.530588 
v =.984353 days, . while the measure taken=$1=.983871 days. The mistake is .000482 days on the lower side or one tithi 
in 2075 days or in 54 years. 
The five yearly period consists of 1830 civil days in which there are 62 synodical months. 
We know 62 x 29.53059=1830.8965 days. Hence in order to make the tithi calculations correct, one day (exactly 0.8965 days) had to be added to the total number of civil days in the period. 
The Time of the Vedanga Jyotisha All recensions of the Vedānga Jyotişa contain the following verses : 
Svarākramete somārkau yadā sākam savāsavau Syāttadādiyugan māghastapah suklo'yanan hyudak. (6) Prapadyete gravişthādau sūryācandramasāvudak Sārpārdhe dakşiņārkastu māghasrāvanayoḥ sadā. (7) These two verses taken together yield the following: 
The winter solstice took place at the lunar asterism Śraviştha, which is later called Dhanişthā. 
This is the 21st nakşatra in the Krttikādi system and 23rd in the Aśvinyādi system and its component stars are a, b, y and 8 Delphini.* These stars are far away from the ecliptic. We have for 1950 : - 
a Delphini, Long. =316° 41' Lat. - +33° 2' B , j =315 39 
= +31 55 y , . = 318 40 
= +32 41 , . 318 35 
= +31 57 
30 
The Arabs have Band & Aquarii which also. represent the Chinese Hsiu. 
It has been stated in the Vedānga Jyotişa that the junction star of the asterism was placed at the beginning of the division and it marked the beginning of Uttarāyana or the W.S. day. Thus the star representing the Dhanişthā division had 270° as the longitude at the time when the tradition of the Vedānga Jyotişa calendar was formulated. If a Delphini is taken as the principal star of the asterism, then its longitude was 270° at the time of the Vedānga Jyotişa and in 1950, its longitude is 316° 41'. As the solstices take about 72 years to retrograde through one degree, the time of Vedānga Jyotişa is found to be (316° 41'--270°) ~ 72 46.07x72=3362 years before 1950 A.D. or 1413 B.C. The star ß Delphini, however, yields a somewhat lower period, i.e., about 1338 B.C. 
Nakshatras The days were named according to the nakşatras or lunar asterisms in which the moon was found, and a lot of crude astrology* had grown up round this system. So it was necessary to predict the nakşatra in advance. The Vedānga Jyotişa calendar prescribed some methods for such predictions. 
In a five yearly period of 1830 days, the sidereal revolutions of the moon amounted to 67 in which there are 1809 wakşatras. 
Actually 1 nakşatra day=51.74100 =1.011913 days, while the measure taken 1888 = 1.011608 days. 
The Plan of the Calendar 
In a period of 5 years, there are : 
1830 civil days, 62 lunar months, and so 1860 tithis, 
67 sidereal months and so 1809 nakşatras. As the period contains 60 solar months, there are 2 intercalary months which are placed after every

30 lunar months. Thus in the third year, the month Srāvana is adhika which is followed by Suddha Brāvana ; and in the fifth year the last month is also adhika which is adhika Māgha. 
There are 1860 tithis while the number of civil days is 1830 ; so there are 30 omitted tithis (tithi kşaya). Each period of 61 days contains 62 tithis, so one lithi is omitted after 61 civil days. From this consideration the number of civil days per month can be obtained and will be shown in the table below. The Vedanga Jyotişa people regularly counted a tithi to a day, but after 61 days one tithi was omitted. 
As regards nakşatras, their number is 1809 in 1830 civil days, the difference being 21. So 877 days were equivalent to 867 nakşatras. They counted a nakşatra to a day successively, but after every 87 days (actually 874 days), one nakşatra was repeated for two days. 
The five different years of the period had distinctive names, vix., (1) Samvatsara, (2) Parivatsara, (3) Idavatsara, (4) Anuvatsara, and (5). Idvatsara. 
The plan of the five yearly calendar is shown below : 
period, and when it was added the last month adhika Magha contained 30 days instead of 29 days which was otherwise its due. 
The ratio , for the duration of the longest day to that of the shortest night given in the Vedānga Jyotişa was first noted by Dr. Thibaut. Later the same ratio was found by Father Kugler from Babylonian cunei form records of the Seleucidean period. The ratio is characteristic of a latitude of 350 N, which is nearly that of Babylon (for Babylon Ø=32° 40'N). Hence it has been inferred that the Vedānga Jyotişa-astronomers got this ratio from Seleucidean Babylon. But it may be pointed out that the Vedic life centred round North-Western India, from the Sarasvati valley (Kuruksetra 0=29° 58') to Gandhar ($=31° 32'N). The ratios of the duration of daylight to, night on the summer-solstice day for different latitudes are as follows:

It is seen from the above table, that even at the latitude of Babylon, the ratio is not 1.50 but: 1.45. At Gandhār, it is 1.42. The difference is not very large. But there is another factor to which attention must be drawn. 
Both Babylonians and Indians measured subdivisions of the day by means of some kind of Clepsydra. A description of the Clepsydra used by Indians during the Vedanga Jyotéşa-period will be found in S.B. Dikşit's Bharatiya Jyotiśāstra (Sec. II, Chap. I). But 'the daya length must have been measured from the observed time of sunrise to the observed time of sunset. This is somewhat larger than the astronomical time of sunrise on account of refraction. Assuming that the effect of refraction is to elevate a celestial body near the horizon by about 35', and the sun's semi-diameter is about 16', the sun's upper limb appears on the horizon at a place on 32° latitude, about 45 minutes before the centre of the sun is due on the horizon. For the same reason, 'the sunset takes place 45 minutes after the astronomical 
As already shown, the actual length of 62 lunar months is 1830.8965 days, while there are 1830 civil days in the five yearly period. It is therefore very likely that one civil day was added to the period when necessary to make it conform to the phases of the moon which were regularly observed. This additional day was no doubt placed at the end of the 
226 
 
calculated sunget. So the apparent length of the day is increased bg 2* 44 min. or by 9 minutes. Therefore for the latitude of Babylon we have the length of maximum day-light 14h 12m +9m 14h 21m, and the night is gb 399 The ratio is now 1.49. Taking the effect of refraction into consideration the ratio for Gandhar also becomes 1.46, which is not much different from · 1.50 as for Babylon. So it is not necessary to assume that the ratio was obtained from Babylonian sources. 
: We get from this the time of composition of the Mahābhārata as about 450 B.C. or sometime earlier.. 
Varahamihira also notes that the winter solstice: no longer took place at Dhansstha. 
.. - Pañica Siddhantika, III, 21 A śleşārdbádāsit yadā nivșttiḥ kiloşnakiraṇasya Yuktamayanan tadāsit sāmpratamayanam 
punarvasutab. Translation : When the return of the sun towards the south (1.., the summer solstice ) took place from. the middle of Aślesa, tbe ayana was right : at the present time ayana begins from Punarvasu. 
In his Brhat Samhita, an astrological treatise, he. records : 
Effect of Procession The Vedānga Jyotişa was prevalent for a long time over India, for over 1300 years (1000 B.C. to 300 A.D.). Hence it is likely that the subsequent astronomers noticed the gradual shift of the solstitial colure in the lunar-zodiac. In fact, several references are found to this effect. Garga, an astronomer whose name is found in the Mahabharata, where he is described as having an astronomical school at a place called Gargasrota in the Sarasvati basin, is the reputed author of a pre-Siddhantic calendaric treatise called Garga Samhita. . He notes : 
Yadā nivarta to'prāptaḥ śravişthamuttarāyape Ašleşām dakšiņo'prāptah tadā vindyanma had bhayam. 
Translation : When at the time of Ottarāyana the sun is found turning (north) without reaching the Sravişthās; and (at the time of Dakşināyana) turning (south) without reaching the Aśleşā, it should be taken to indicate a period of calamity. 
It shows that at the time of Garga the W.S. did no longer occur in Śravişthā, neither the S.S. occurred in the Aśleşā division. At the time of. Vedanga Jyotoşa the two solstices were marked by the starting point of Śraviştha and the middle point of Asleşā respectively. Garga therefore observed that the solstices were reced ing back over the lunar calendar, and had shifted at least by half a nakşatra-division from the middle of Āşleşā. His observations are therefore at least 480 years later than those of the Vedanga Jyotişa. 
In the Mahabharata we get the following verse : 
Ašvamedha, Chap. 44;2: .. Abab pūrvani tatorātrirmāsāḥ śukládayalı gmịtāḥ Sravaņādini çkşāni staveb sisirādayah . 
Translation : Day comes first and then the night ; months, are known to commence with the bright half, the nakşatras with Śravana, and the seasons with Sibira, 
Here the asterism Śravana is described as the one where the winter solstice takes place. Sravana is ust preceding Sravistha and the solstices take about 460 years to retrograde through one nakşaira division. 
Brhat Samhitā, III, 1 Asleşārdbātdakgiņam uttaramayanan raverdbanişthôdyam Nūnaṁ kadācidāsīt yenoktani pūrvasõstresu. 
Translation : The beginning of the southern motion when the sun has passed half of Aśleşā and the begin ning of the northern motion when the sun has passed the beginning of Dhanişthā, must have taken place at some epoch; for these are recorded in old treatises. 
From the time of Vedānga Jyotişa to Varāhamihira's. time the summer solstice moved through more than 14 nakşatras ( f of Aslesá + Pusya ) which indicated a lapse of more than 1500 years from the time of Vedānga. 
Jyotişa. 
It is thus seen that the Hindu astronomers observed. the shifting of the cardinal points due to precession of the equinoxes ; but as they had not developed the sense of era, they were unable to find out the time. interval between different records, and obtain a rate for precession, as was done by Hipparchos. Their observations were also crude; as they used only the lunar zodiac. The shifting of the solstitial colures remained to them an unsolved mystery.

5.5 CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE INSCRIPTIONAL 
RECORDS ABOUT CALENDAR In this chapter, we are undertaking a critical review of the references to the calendar in ancient inscriptions, because, from the point of view of accurate history, inscriptional records are far more valuable than any references in ancient scriptures or classics, as they are contemporary documents, which have remained unaltered since the framers left them.. 
* Bometimes inscriptions and copper plate records have been found to have been forged at a latter date but such instances are rare and can not escape detection by an experienced archaeologist 
INDIAN OALENDAR 
227 
References in ancient scriptures, poems, epics and other literatures are, on the other hand, very often liable to alterations, interpolations and errors in the hands of latter-day copyists and are, therefore, less trust-worthy. 
The oldest inscriptional records bearing a date ( barring those belonging to the Indus-valley period which have not been deciphered ) belong to the reign of the Emperor Asoka ( 273-236 B.C.). From these, we can make fairly accurate deductions regarding the calendar then in use. 
We take the Fifth Pillar Edict, Rāmpurvā version found at the Champaran district, Bibar. The language is Asokan Prākrt, the script is the oldest form of Brāhmi. (Sircar pp. 62-63 ) 
Fifth Pillar Edict--Rāmpurvā Version (1) Sadĩsati[a]sabhisitena($advensat-targabhiji 
ktena)--After twenty-six years had elapsed 
since coronation'. (2) Tīsu cātummā[si]su tisyam pumnamāsiyain tini 
divasāni cāvudasam pamnadasan patipadam..... ( Tiszşu cãturmāsīşu tişyāyān pūrnamāsyām, trişu divaseşu.caturdaśe pancadaše pratipadi...... 'On the three cãturmāsī days, on the tişya full 
moon day, on the 14th, 15th and the first 
day..............." (On these and some other days, sale of fish is 
forbidden). Again, in the same : 
(3) Athami-pakhāye cãrudasāye pamnadasāye 
tisāye punāvasune... ...(Aşgami-pakşe, catur-daśyāin, pancadaśyān, tişyāyāin, 
punarvasau............); 'On the eighth pakşa, on the 14th, and the 
15th (new moon ) on the Tişya and 
Punarvasu Nakşatra days........., (On these days, he forbids the castration of 
bulls). 
From these passages, we conclude that : 1. No era was used, but .regnal years ( number of 
years elapsed since the king's coronation ) 
were used for dating. 2. The time-reckoning was by seasons, each of 
8 pakşas. The seasons are : Grīsma (Summer): Comprising Caitra, Vaišākha, 
Jyaiştha, Astrid Varşā (Rains) : Comprising? Śrārana, Bhadra, 
Āśvina, Kārtika. Hemanta (Winter): Comprising Agrahāyana, 
Parşa, Māgha, Phälguna. 
3. The months are not mentioned by name, except 
in one case where the month of Māgha is mentioned. They are purņimānta, i.e., they started after full moon and ended in full moon. This is not expressly mentioned but can be inferred from the fact that the 14th, the 15th (Pañicadaßi) and the Pratipada, i.e., the first tithi are enjoined to be the days on which certain actions are forbidden. These must be the three days of invisibility of the moon, the 14th being before new moon, the 15th the new moon, and the first, the day after new moon, which were observed as unsuitable for 
many particular performances. 4. The day reckoning was by the tithi (lunar day), 
but the word tithi is probably not to be taken in the sense of the present Siddhantic tithi, but in the sense of the Vedanga Jyotisa tithi or the old Brahmanic tithi. In the latter system, a tithi was counted from moon-set to moon-set during the bright half, and from 
·moon-rise to moon-rise during the dark-half. 
There was the same tithi for the whole day. Prof. P. C. Sen Gupta has discussed this 
method of tithi reckoning (see p. 222 ). . 5. Two days are mentioned by the lunar asterisms 
Tişya (8 Cancri), and Punarvasu (6 Geminorum). As suggested one was probably his birth naksatra, the other his coronation naksatra. The days were therefore also named after the nakşatra. This system is found in vogue in the epic Mahābhārata, e.g., in the following 
passage : Balarama, the elder brother of Krşna, after returning from pilgrimage on the eighteenth day of the battle states : 
M. Bh., Salya Parva, Ch.34, 6 Catvāriņsadahānyadya dve ca me niħsștasya vai Puşyeņa samprayāto'smi Šravane punarāgataḥ.. 
Translation: It is forty-two days since I left the house. I started on the Puşya (day) and have returned on the Śravaņa. 
6. There is no mention of the year-beginning. 
The Tişya Purnamāsi, i.e., the full-moon day ending the lunar month of Pauşa is marked 
out particularly. It appears from the records that in Asoka's time, the principles followed in framing the calendar were those given in the Vedānga Jyotişa. No era was used. From the inscriptions, we can make no inference about the luni-solar adjustment, but there is no doubt that the year was seasonal as given in the inscription of the Satavahanas (see next page). 
C. R.--37

No records bearing a date of the imperialdynasties following the Mauryas, viz., the Sungas, and Kanvas (186 B.C.-45 A:D.) are known. But the next imperial dynasty, the Satavahanas have left plenty of dated records. In these, the same system of date-recording by regnal years, the seasons, the pakşas, and tithis are found. There are 8 pakşas in a season of four months, and they were serially numbered from 1 to 8. The odd ones were Krşņa pakşas, the even ones Sukla paksas. 
Some examples are given below : 
(1) Nāsik Inscription of the Satavahana Emperor, Gautamiputra Sri Satakarni (Sircar, pp. 192-93). 
Data patikā Savachare 10+8 vāsapakhe 2 divase 1 
(dattă pritika Samvatsare aştādase 18 Varsāpakşe 
divtiye 2 divase prathame 1). i.e. the inscription was recorded in the eighteenth year elapsed since the coronation on the first day of the second Paksa of the Varşă season, i.e., in the lunar month of Śrāvana, on the first day after new moon (Sukla pakşa). 
There are other Satavahana inscriptions similarly dated as summarized in the table below : 
According to our calculations, the date of Gautami putra Satakarni would be about the first century A.D. We take some still later records. 
(2) Rāja Virapuruşadatta of Nagarjunikonda (Sircar, 
pp. 220-221) Ramno Siri Virapurisadatasa Sava 6 vā pa 6 di 10 
(Rājfiah Sri Virapuruşadattasya sainvatsare 
şaşthe 6 rarşāpakşe şaşthe 6 divase daśame 10. On the sixth year of King Sri Virapuruşadatta on 'the 6th pakşa of the varşă season, on the tenth day. The sixth of varşā pakşa is month of Aśvina, second or light half (Sukla pakşa). - It is obvious from the above inscriptional evidences, that continuous era-recording was not used by Indian dynasts up to the time of the Satavahanas, and no ancient books, not even the Mahabhārata mentions an era. 
As no era is mentioned, it has been difficult to work out a chronology of the early Indian dynasts including the Satavahanas.

The number in the first column indicates the serial number of the inscription in Lūders' list. The last column contains dates, in an abridged form ; e.g., in 1123, we have 19, G 2-13. Here '19' is the regnal year, G denotes Grişma or summer season, '2' following G denotes the second pakşa, i.e., the second half of the month of Caitra, megaftituting the Sukla pakşa, and the last numeral '13' denotes the day. But it is not clear whether the day is the lunar day, i.e., the tithi or the solar day. Even if it be the tithi, it is probably not the Siddhāntic tithi, but the old Brahmaṇic or Vedanga tithi. 
The Coming of the Era to India As, we have seen in $3.5, the era reckoning had been in use in Babylon since 747 B.C., and the Seleucidean era which marked the accession to power of Seleucus at Babylon in 312 B.C., was widely current in the whole of the Middle East, both by the royalty and the public. 
But though as Asoka's Girnar inscription says that he was in diplomatic correspondence with five Greek kings of the West, including Antiochus I and II of Babylon, and the Ptolemy of Egypt, and sent Buddhist missionaries, to these countries, it is clear from his records that he continued to use the purely Indian methods of date-recording based on the Vedanga-Jyotişa. There is not the slightest indication that any of the Indian imperial dynasties which followed the Mauryas, viz., the Sungas and Kanvas (186 B.C.-45 A.D.), the Satavahanas ( 100 A.D.) allowed themselves to be influenced by the Graeco-Chaldean luni-solar calendar which was then in vogue in the Near East.. 
From about 180 B.C., North-Western India having Taxila as capital passed under the Bactrian Greeks. 
It is rather strange that though we have plenty of coins of the Bactrian Greeks who ruled in Afghanistan and N.W. India between 160 B.C., and 50 B.C., from which their names have been recovered, and some kind of chronology has been worked out, not a single record has yet been discovered which bears a date, except two doubtful ones. One is the coin of a certain Plato, found in the Kabul valley, which bears certain symbols which have been interpreted as 147 of the Seleucidean era, i,e., 165 B.C., Plato has been﻿INDIAN OALENDAR

century A.D: The inscriptions are mostly in Kharoshi and later ones found on Indian soil are in Brahmi. The Kharoşthi inscriptions are collected by Dr.Sten Konow in his monumental work Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol. II., Part I., and are reproduced below in Groups A and B.. : Group A is identical with Konow's A (with the omission of Nos. 20-23) and contains dates from year 58 to 200. Group B, identica with Konow's B-Group, contains the inscriptions of Kuşāna period bearing dates of years between 300 and 400. 
identified by Tarn to be a brother of Eucratidas, founder of the second Greek ruling house (175 B.C: 139 B.C:) in Bactria. But the interpretation' is doubtful. 
The second one is an inscription of the time of king Menander, the great king of the Euthydemid house who ruled over the Punjab, Sind and Rajputana about 150 B.C., on the Shinkot Steatite Casket, the only one of the Greek kings who has found a permanent place in Indian literature in the celebrated Milinda Panho, a' philosophical treatise meaning questions of king Menander. The inscription referred to mentions regnal year 5, the Indian month of Vaisakha, and the twenty-fifth day. Thus the date recording is Indian, but slightly different from the system used in Asokan or Satavahana inscriptions because the paksa is omitted. 
Our studies given in $ 33, shows that a mathe matically accurate luni-solar calendar, based on astronomical knowledge, was first evolved in Seleucid Babylon between 300 B.C. to 200 B.C. by Chaldean astronomers. The features of this calendar were : 
(a) The use of the Seleucidean era for numbering years in place of the regral years. 
(b) The beginning of the year with the lunar month of Nisan which was to start on a date not later than a month of the vernal eqxinox. 
(This corresponds to the Indian month of Vaisakha later defined in Siddhāntic calendars). 
· (c) There was an alternative method of starting with the Greek month of Dios which was to begin on a đate not later than a month of the autumnal equinox. 
(This corresponds to the Indian month of Kärlika, as later defined in Siddhantic calendars). 
(8) Luni-solar adjustment was done by the nineteen year cycle (vide $ 32-34). 
This system of date-recording spread far and wide in the Near East and was adopted by other ruling dynasties, viz., the Parthians, who however used an era starting from 248 B.C. They used Macedonian months without alteration. : . It can now be shown that this system penetrated gradually into India.

Era or eras of unknown origin began to be mentioned in certain inscriptions found in the North Western Punjab and the Kabul valley about the first century B.C.

BEPORT OF THE CALENDAR REFORM COMMITTEE 
The Method of Date Recording A record fully dated in Group A gives : 
The year of the era in figures and words ; though it does not give any particular designation to the era. 
The month, mostly in Sanskrit ; the day, by its ordinal number, e.g., No. 11, which means in the year 111 on the 15th day of the month of Śrāvaņa. 
The months are all in Sanskrit, except in No. 6, in which the month is in Greek (Panemos= Āsādha). No. 6 alone of this group contains the rather mysterious phrase 'Etaye purvaye' which means, 'before these'. This phrase, the meaning of which is not clear, occurs in Kuşāna (Group B) and even in Gupta inscriptions. 
This method of dating is quite different from that of the contemporary Indian dynasts, viz., the Satavahanas, which mentioned regnal years, the season, the pakşa, and then probably the old tithi or the lunar day. But it agrees with the method followed in contemporary Parthia, which mentions the year usually in the Seleucidean era, rarely in the Arsacid era, the name of the month in Greek, and the ordinal number of the day, which ranges from 1 to 30 (see Debevoise, 1938). From No. 10, it appears that whenever Indian months were used they were Purnimanta, following the classical Indian custom. 
which is supposed to stand for Azes. But this has been disputed. 
This series starts with the year 58, if Cunningham's reading of (1) with the additional reading of the king's name 'Moasa' is accepted. But even if we reject it, the series certainly starts with the year 68 in No. 5, and goes up to 136 at fairly small intervals, then to 168, 187, 191, 200 containing names of rulers known from coins, viz., besides Maues above mentioned, Gondophernes (103 = 20 B.C.), some Kuşana king (122 = 1 B.C.), Devaputra Kuşāna (136=14 A.D.), Mahārāj. bhrata Jehonika (191=69 A.D.). They are held to be dated in the same era, which is usually called the Old Śaka Era, shortly called O.S.E. But up to this time, there has been no unanimity amongst scholars about the starting date of the era used in inscriptions grouped under A. 
We now take the second group of inscriptions which are those of the Kuşānas, who ruled in North India in the second century A.D. 
· Date of records of Group A None of the inscriptions of Group A appear to be 'Royal Records' but some contain names of kings, e.g., No. 6, which mentions a Mahārājā Mahamta Moga, who is taken to be identical with a king whose coins have been found in large numbers in Gandhara. He calls himself 'Maves' in the Greek inscription on the obverse, and Moasa (i.e. of Moa) in Kharoşthi on the reverse. The title given there usually is Maharajasa Rajatirajasa Mahantasa. It is held that King Moga was Saka leader who starting from a base in Seistan or Arachosia, invaded Gandhara through the southern route, sailed up the Indus, and ousted the Greek rulers Archebius from Taxila, Artemidorus from Puşkalavati and Telephos from Kapsā (Bachhofer, 1936) and founded a large empire comprising parts of Afghanistan, Gandbara and the Punjab. 
He is generally held to have been a Saka, but some hold without sufficient reason that he was a Parthian. He is the firstwef Indo-Scythian kings known to numismatics. He was followed by other Indo-Scythian kings in Gandhara, who are known from wide variety of coins issued, viz., Azes I, .Azilises and Azes II. But there is no clear reference to them in these ins criptions except the word 'Ayasa' in Nos. 10 and 15,

Their method of date-recording is the same as in Group A, viz., (see No. 25.) the year of the era, the month name in Greek or Sanskrit, the ordinal number of the day, then, the phrase equivalent to asyāin pūrvāyām ( before these to but in these inscriptions, it is expressed in the form ise kşunami or its variant, which has been interpreted by. Konow as equivalent of asyāîn or etasyām pūrvāyān in the Khotani Saka language which Konow thinks was the mother tongue of kings of the Kanişka group and which they use in their inscriptions. In fact kings of this group use a number of Khotani Saka words, and from their wide range of coins are known to have put in a medley of Greek, Iranian, and Indian gods including Buddha on their coins, but the names of the gods are not in their original Indian, Iranian or Greek form but'invari ably in the form used in the Khotani Saka language. 
The method of date-recording followed by the Kuşānas, in spite of its identity with that of Group A shows some interesting variations. In the Kharoşthi inscriptions of the Kuşānas, the months are mostly Greek, less so in Sanskrit ( Caitra, Vaišākha, etc. ). The days run from 1 to 30 and clearly they are not tithis but solar days. When we turn to Brahmi inscrip tions, we find that the month names are mostly seasonal : Grişma, Varşā, or Hemanta as in the Satava hana records. But since 4 is the maximum number attached to these, and the day numbers run from 1 to 30, the number after the season denotes a month, not a pakşa and the damnare solar. Thus G 4 denotes the fourth month of the Grisma season, viz, Aşādha, and not the fourth paksa as was the case with the Satavābanas, which would be the second half of 
Vaišākha. The pakşa is given up. 
This is a deviation from Sātavāhana method of date-recording and follows closely the Graeco-Chal dean method. Some inscriptions mention Greek months (e. g. Gorpiaios which is Āśvina or Bhādra in Sircar's No. 49, p. 146 ) others Indian lunar months (e. g. Śrāvana in No.51 ), but their number is small compared with the seasonal mode of recording months. These inscriptions give no indication as to whether the month is Pūrnimānta or Amānta. The Indian months are Pūrnimānta. 
But the Zeda inscription of year 11 ( No. 26 of Group B) mentions that the nakşatra was Uttaraphalguni on the 20th of Āşādha, and (35) mentions that in the year 61, the nakşatra on the 8th day of Caitra was Pārvāşādhā. A comparison with tables of nakşatras shows that the months ended in full moon (Pūrnimānta). As pūrnimānta months were unknown outside India, the Kuşānas must have yielded to Indian influence and adapted their original time-reckonings to the Indian custom; at least in their use of Indian months.. 
Historians and chronologists now almost unani mously hold that all these inscriptions of Group B are dated in the same era which is sometimes called the Kuşāna era, which was founded by King Kaniska. This is said to be proved by the fact that the inscrip tions range from year 1, and we have phrases as in No. 25 of the Mahārāja Rājādhiraja Devaputra Kaniska, in the year 11. But a little more scrutiny shows that it is only a conventional phraseology, used in almost all Kuşāna inscriptions, for even in as late as an inscription of year 98 of this group, we read 'of the Mahārājā Väsudeva in the year 98'. It is therefore by no means clear that such phrases can be interpreted to mean that Kaniska started an entirely new era. In fact, from Kaniska's profuse use of Greek months and Greek gods in his inscriptions and coins, Cunningham was led to the belief that Kaniska dated his inscriptions in the Seleucidean era, with hundreds omitted, so that year 1 of Kaniska, is the year -401 of S. E. and year 90 of the Christian era. 
But it has been known for some time that the Kuşāna ëmpire did not stop with that Vasudeva' who comes after Huviska. Dr. L. Bachhofer (1936) has proved from numismatics the existence of : 
Kaniska III, reigning apparently after Vasudeva I, Vasudeva II, reigning after Kanişka III. 
The kings appear to have retained full control of the whole of modern Afghanistan including Bactria which appears to have been the home land of the Kuşānas and some parts of the Punjab, right up to Mathura. . There is yet no proof for or against the point that they retained the eastern parts, after year 98 of Kuşāna 
232 
 
éra. Herzfeld had established that Vasudeva II, who appears to have come after Kaniska III about 210 A.D., was deprived of Bactria by Ardeshir I, the founder of the Sasanid dynasty of Persia. The Sasanids converted Bactria into a royal.province under the charge of the crown prince, who struck coins closely imitating those of the Kuşānas. Vasudeva II is also mentioned in the Armenian records of Moise of Khorene, a Jewish scholar, under the name Vabsadjan, as an Indian king who tried to form a league with Armenia and other older powers against the rising imperialism of Ardeshir. Vasudeva II is also thought to have sent an embassy to China about 230 A.D *. . 
The second Sassanian king Shapur I, claims to have conquered sometime after 240 A.D. 'PSKVR', which has been identified with Puruşapura or Peshawar, the capital of the Kuşānas. This has also been confirmed by the French excavations at Begram (Kapisi) in Afghanistan, which was destroyed by Shapur between 242 and 250 A.D. But this probably was not a permanent occupation but a raid, as a Kuşāna king or Shah is mentioned in the Paikuli inscription of the Sasanid king Narseb (293-302 A.D.). 
Kushana Method of Date-recording In India : 
It appears rather strange that the Kuşana way of date-recording should suddenly come to a dead stop on Indian soil with the year 98 of Vasudeva I, and no records containing a year number exceeding 100 should be found on Indian soil. 
The mystery appears now to have been successfully solved by Mrs. Van Lohuizen de Leeuw in her book The Scythian Period (pub. 1949). She has proved that several Brahmi inscriptions in the Mathurā region bear dates from years 5 to 57 in which, following an old Indian practice, the figure for hundred hąs been omitted. Thus '5' stands for 105, '14' stands for 114 of the Kuşāna era. The following example will suffice (vide pp. 242-43 of The Scythian Period). 
One and the same person Arya Vasula, female pupil of Arya Sangamikā, holding the important position of a religious preacher in the Jaina community, is mentioned in two Brahmi inscriptions (No. 24 and No. 70 of Lūders) bearing the year designations of 15 and 86 respectively, the date-recording being in the typical Kuşāna style. The palaeographical evidence also shows that the inscriptions were recorded in the Kuşāna age, though the name of the reigning monarch 
is not mentioned. Now it is clearly impossible that: the same person would 'occupy such an important. position from the year 15 to 86, a period of 71 years. L. de Leeuw therefore suggests that while 86 is the usual Kuşāna year (reckoning from year 1, of Kaniska), '15' is really with hundred omitted and represents actually the year 115 of Kaniska, i.e., dates of the two inscriptions differ by 115-86=29 years, which is much more plausible. In other words, after the year 100 of the Kaniska era was passed, hundreds were dropped in inscriptions found near about Mathura. 
The author has sustained her ground by numerous other illustrations, and there seems to be no doubt that this is a brilliant suggestion and it can be taken as proved that in numbering years of an era, hundreds were omitted in certain parts of the Kuşana dominion in the second century of the Kaniska era. L. de Leeuw has found such dates in no less than 7 instances bearing years 5, 12, 15, 22, 35, 50, 57 in which apparently 103 has been omitted, so that 57 really stands for 157, and if we take the Kaniska era to have started from 78 A.D., the date of the last one is A.D. 235=(157 +78). Probably the name of the reigning king was not mentioned, as he had either lost control over these regions, or as the inscriptions were religious, it was not considered necessary. The second alternative appears to be more correct. 
This is supported by the inscription on an image discovered by Dayaram Sahni in Mathurā in 1927, It mentions Māhārāja Deraputra Kanişka. But on palaeographic grounds, he can neither be Kaniska I (1-24) nor Kaniska II (41), but a later Kaniska, coming after Vasudeva I, and 14 is really, year 114 of the Kaniska era. We may identify him with Kaniska III of Bachhofer. 
So we come to this conclusion : 
The records of Kuşana kings, after Kaniska I range from year 1 to 98. In the second century of -the Kaniska era, hundreds are omitted and such records have been found up.to year 157, i.e., year 235 of the Christian era. 
This raises a strong presumption that Kaniska was not the founder of the era, but he used one already in vogue, but omitted the hundreds. · Thus year 1 of Kaniska is really year 1 plus some hundred, may be 1, 2, or 3. L. de Leeuw does not expressly suggest this, though it is apparent from her reasoning that year 1 of King Kanişka is year 201 of the Old Saka era*. If this suggestion be correct, since the old Saka era is taken to have started in 123 B.C. (-122 A.D.) instead of in 129 B.C., as postulated by L. de Leeuw, Kaniska started reigning in ( 201 – 123 )-78 A.D. . 
* The suggestion is of Prof. M. N. Saha. 
in 
* Ghirshman thought that the Vāsudeva Kuşāpa of these references is Visudeva I, whose last reference is year 98. He equated year 98 of Kaniska's era to year 242-250 A.D., and arrived at the - date 144 to 162 A.D. for the initial year of the Kaniska era. But the 
equation of this Visudeva with Vásudeva I is certainly wrong. This must be Vasudeva II, or may be a still lator Vibadera.

From the above review of inscriptional records and contemporary history, the following story has been reconstructed. 
(1) The. Saka era was first started in 123 B.C. when the Sakas coming from Central Asia due to the pressure of Hunas wrested Bactria from the Parthian emperors after a seven years' war. The leader was probably one 'Azes', and therefore the era was also alternately called the 'Azes' era. This Azes is not to be confounded with the two later Azes who succeeded Maues and reigned between 45 B. C. to 20 B. C. Earlier Sakas used Macedonian months and Graeco Chaldean method of date recording, prevalent throughout the whole of Near East. In Indian dominions, Indian months which were equated to Greek months were used. As their coins show, the ruling class had adopted Greek culture. 
(2) When the - Sakas spread from "Sakasthān', i.e., modern Afghanistan into contiguous parts of India, they began to be influenced by Indian culture. During the first stage, they exclusively used Greek in their coins, but later they began to use Kharoşthi and Brahmi as well. The coins of Maues (80 B.C:---45 B.C.), Azes I, Azilises, Azes II show increasing influence of Indian culture. The southern Sakas who penetrated into Saurashtra and Malwa show Indian influence to a greater degree. . 
(3) In the first three centuries, they (Maues group, Nahapāna group and Kuşānas) used the old Saka era omitting hundreds, and using a method of date recording which was an exact copy of the contem porary Graeco-Chaldean system prevalent throughout the Parthian empire (Macedonian months, and ordinal number of days). But they also began to use Indian months. Whenever they did it, the , month was Purnimānta, as was the custom with old Hindu dynasts (Mauryas and Satavahanas). 
(4). The classical Saka era starting from 78 A.D. is nothing but the old Śaka era, starting from 123 B.C. with 200 omitted, so that the year 1 of Kaniska is year 201 of the Old Saka era. 
The senior author has shown that Nahapjna used the old Saka bra with one hundred omitted, so that the year 46 of Nahapāna was the year 146 of the old Saka era or about 24 A.D. 
The Satavahana kings Gautamiputra Satakarni and his son Vasişthiputra Pulumaví, whose records are .found dated in the typical Indian fashion, reigned according to his hypothesis from about 40 A.D. to 80 A.D. From epigraphical record, Nahapana is at least separated by about 100 years from the next group of Saka rulers, viz., the Sakas of Ujjain belonging to the house of Caştana. 
The Saka satraps of Ujjain. We come across the records of another Saka ruling family, reigning in Ujjain. 
[Andau (Cutch) stone inscriptions of the time of Castana and Rudradaman, Sircar, p. 167].

Translation : Of king Castana, son of Jamotika and of king Rudradaman son of Jayadaman, in the year 52, on the dark half of the month of Phalguna and on 
the 2nd day.... 
This inscription mentions the year 52, the second day of the Krsna pakşa of the month of Phālguna. 
There is no doubt that the year mentioned is that of the Baka era as now known. For this satrapal house reigned continuosly for nearly 300 years and has left a wealth of dated records. But the name of the era is not mentioned in the earlier records. They are mentioned merely as years so and so. 
The earliest authentic instance of the use of Saka era by name is supplied by the Badæmi inscription of Calikya Vallabhesvara (Pulakesin I of the Calukya dynasty), dated 465 of the Saka era (Šaka- Varsanu Catus-sateşu pañca-şasthi-yutesu : Epigraphia Indica XXVII, p. 8). In literature the use of the era by name appears still earlier. The Lokavibhāga of Simhasari, a Digambara Jaina work in Sanskrit is stated in a manuscript to have been completed in 80 beyond 300 (i.e. 380) of the Saka years (Ep. Ind., XXVII, p. 5). There is no doubt that the era used in the records of the western satrapal house beginning with Castana and Rudradaman have come down to the present times as the saka Era, which is the 'Era' par excellence used by Indian astronomers for purposes of calculation. There ere 30 or more 'Eras' which have been in use in India (vide $ 5*8), but none of them have been 
Śaka Era in the South-West. Besides the earlier Sakas belonging to the Maues group, and the Kuşānas, there was another groupof Saka kings, who penetrated into the south-western part of India. The earliest representative of this group was Nahapana and his son-in-law Uşavadata. Their records are dated in years 41 to 46 of an unknown era. They use Indian lunar honths and days (probably tathis). These Sakas ruled in Rajputana, Malwa, and northern Maharastra and were engaged in continuous warfare with the Satavahana ruler Gautamiputra Satakarni who claim to have destroyed them root and branch.

used for calendaricat calculation by the · Indian astronomers. 
Yet it is difficuit wo assign the origin of the saka era to the western satraps. · An era can be founded only by an imperial dynasty like the Seleucids, the Parthians or the Guptas. The western satraps never claim, in their numerous records, any imperial position. They are always satisfied with the subordingte titles like Kşatrapa (Satrap) or Maha Kşatrapa (Great Satrap) while the imperial position is claimed by their northern contemporaries, the Kuşānas, 
The conclusion is that the western Kşatrapas used the old Śaka era, with 200 omitted ; so that year 1 of the present Śaka era is year 201 of the old Śaka era, i.e., (201-122)=79 A.D. . 
The gradual adoption of characteristic Indian ideas by the Sakas is shown in a record of Satrap Rudrasimha dated 103 S.E. or 181 A.D.

The Saka satrap Rudrasimba, reigning in 181 A.D. thus dates his inscriptions using an era (the Saka era), purely Indian months, tithes and nakşatras. This is in full Siddhantic style, because the characteristic features of Siddhāntic method of date recording which mention lithi and nakşatra are first found in this inscription. The 'week day' is however not mentioned. 
This is first mentioned in an inscription of the emperor Budhagupta (484 A. D.).

6.6 SOLAR CALENDAR IN THE SIDDHANTA 
JYOTISHA PERIOD : Rise of Siddhantas or Scientific Astronomy: 
The Vedānga Jyotişa calendarical rules appear, from inscriptional records, to have been used right up to the end of the reign of the Satavahanas (200 A.D.). The analysis of inscriptional data on methods of date recording given in $ 5.5 shows that it was the Saka and Kuşāņa rulers (50 B.C. - 100 A.D.), who introduced the Graeco-Chaldean methods of date-recording, prevalent in' the Near East into India. These methods require a knowledge of the fundamentals of astronomy, which must have been available to the Saka and Kuşāna rulers. In India, as 'the inscriptional records show, some purely Indian dynasts probably accepted the system in full from about 248 A.D. (date of foundation of the Kalachuri era, the earliest era founded by Indian kings, leaving aside the Saka era which is admittedly of foreign origin and the Vikrama era whose origin is still - shrouded in mystery). During the time of the Guptas who founded an era commemorating their accession to power in 319 A.D. the integration of the western system with the Indian appears to have been complete. 
Indian astronomical treatises, explaining the rules of calendaric astronomy, are known as Siddhantas, but it is difficult to find out their dates. The earliest Indian astronomer who gave a date for himself was the celebrated Aryabhata who flourished in the ancient city of Pataliputra and was born in 476 A.D. 
It is necessary to reply to a question which has very often been asked, but never satisfactorily answered, viz., 
Why did the Indian savants who were in touch with the Greeks, and probably with Greek science since the time of Alexander's raid (323 B.C.), take about 500-600 years to assimilate Greek astronomy, and use it for their own calendar-framing ? 
The Indians of 300 B.C. to 400 A.D., were quite vigorous in body as well as in intellect as is shown by their capacity to resist successive hordes of foreign invaders, and their remarkable contributions to religion, art, literature and certain sciences. Why did they not accept the fundamentals of Greek astronomy for calendarical calculations earlier ? 
The reply to this query appears to be as follows: 
The Greeks of Alexander's time had almost nothing to give to the Indians in calendaric astronomy, for their own knowledge of astronomy at this period was extremely crude and far inferior to that of the contemporary Chaldeans. The remarkable achieve ments of the Greeks in astronomy, and geometry,

though they started from the time. of Alexander. (Plato's Academy), really flowered in full bloom in the century following Alexander (330 B.Co - 200 B.C.). The culmination is found in Hipparchos of Rhodes who flourished from 160-120 B.C.; he wrote treatises on astronomy. Simultaneously in Seleucid Babylon, Chaldean and Greek astronomers made scientific contributions of the highest order to astronomy (vide $ 4.7 & 4.8 ), but none of their works have survived, but are now being found by archaeological explorations. 
It is therefore, obvious that the Indians of the age of Asoka (273 B.C.—200 B.C.), who were in touch with the Greek kingdoms of Babylon and Egypt, had not much to learn from the Greeks in astronomy. 
The Maurya's were succeeded by the Sungas (186 B.C.--75 B.C.), but Indians during this age were in touch only with the Bactrian Greeks. But by this time, the Parthian empire had arisen (250 B.C.), producing a wedge between western and eastern Greeks. The only dated record of the Indo-Bactrian king, Menander (150 B.C.), is purely Indian in style. 
By about 150 B.C., direct contact between India and Greater Greece which included Babylon had almost ceased, due to the growth of the Parthian empire. Whatever ideas came, was through the Saka-Kuşāna kingdoms which came into existence after 90 B. C. By that time, astronomy was regarded as only secondary to planetary and horoscopic astrology, which had grown to mighty proportions in the West. This may have been probably one of the main reasons for late acceptance of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy in India, for Indian thought during these years was definitely hostile to astrology. 
It will surprise many of our readers to be told that astrology was not liked by Indian leaders of thought, which dominated Indian life during the period 500 B.C.-1 A.D. Nevertheless, it is a very correct 
view. 
The Great Buddha, Whose thoughts and ideas dominated India from 500 B.C. to the early centuries of the Christian era, was a determined foe of astro logy. In Buddha's time, and for hundreds of years after Buddha, there was in India no elaborate planetary or horoscopic astrology, but a crude kind of astrology based on conjunctions of the moon with stars and on various kinds of omina such as appearance of comets, eclipses, etc. But Buddha appears to have held even such astrological forecasts in great contempt, as is evident from the following passage ascribed to him : 
Yathā vā pan'eke bbonto. Samaņa-brāhmanā saddhā-deyyāni bhojanāni bhuñjitva te evarūpāya tiraccbāna-vijjāya micchājīvena-jībika m kappenti 
Translation : Some brāhmaṇas and framanas earn their livelihood by taking to beastly professions and eating food brought to them out of fear ; they say : "there will be a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse, occulta tion of the stars, the sun and the moon will move in the correct direction, in the incorrect direction, the nakşatras will move in the correct path, in the incorrect path, there will be precipitation of meteors, burning of the cardinal directions (?), earth quakes, roar of heavenly war drums, the sun, the moon, and the stars will rise and set wrongly producing wide distress amongst all beings, etc." 
This attitude to astrology and astrolatry on the part of Indian leaders of thought during the period of 500 B.C. to 100 A.D., was.undoubtedly a correct one, and would be welcomed by rationalists of all ages and countries. But such ideas had apparently a very deterrent effect on the study of astronomy in India. Pursuit of astronomical knowledge was confused with astrology, and its cultivation was definitely forbidden in the thousands of monasteries which sprang all over the country within few hundred years of the Nirvana (544 B.C./ 483 B.C). Yet monasteries were exactly the places where astronomical studies could be quietly. pursued and monks were, on account of their leisure and temparament, eminently fitted for taking up such studies, as had happened later in Europe, where some of the most eminent astronomers came from the monkist ranks, e.g., Copernicus and Fabricius. 
Neither did Hindu leaders, opposed to Buddhism, encourage astrology and astrolatry. The practical politician thought that the practice of astrology was not conducive to the exercise of personal initiative and condemned it in no uncertain terms. In the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya, a treatise on statecraft, which took shape between 300 B.C. and 100 A.D., and is ascribed to Canakya, the following passage is found :

Aryabhata and Varahamihira who made great scientfic contributions to 'astronomy belonged to this race. The planetary Sungod is always shown with high boots on, as in the case of Central Asian kings (e.g., Kaniska)... 
It is a task for the historian to trace how the steps in which the importation of western astronomical knowledge took place for the Siddhantas, which incorporate this knowledge and are all a few centuries later, and many of them bear no date. . 
A good point d'appui for discussion is Vardhamihira's Panca Siddhantikā.; for Varahamihira's date is known. He died in 587 A.D., in ripe old age so he must have written his book about 550 A.D. This is a compendium reviewing the knowledge contained in the five Siddhantas which were current at his time. These were regarded as 'Apauruşeya' or "knowledge revealed by gods or mythical persons”. 
Translation: The' objective (artha) eludes the foolish man (balam) who enquires too much from the 'stars. The objective should be the nakşatra of the 
objective, of what avail are the stars? 
This may be taken to represent the views of the practical politician about astrology and astrolatry, during the period 500 B.C. to 100 B.C. 
Canakya was the great minister of Candragupta, and history says that these two great leaders rolled back the bordes of the Macedonians, who had con. quered the Acheminid Empire of Iran comprising the whole of the Near East to the borders of Iran; and thereafter laid the foundation of the greatest empire India has ever seen. They clearly not only did not believe in astrology, but openly, and without reserve, ridiculed its pretensions. 
But the influence of original Buddhism waned after the rise of Mahāyānist Buddhism, which received great encouragement during the reign of Kaniska (78 A.D. to 102 A.D.) and other Kuşāna and Saka kings. Then came Buddhist iconography, coins, and knowledge of the methods of western date-recording which the Sakas and Kuşānas used. They blended with the indigenous Indian system slowly. 
The focus of diffusion of western astronomical knowledge appears to have been the city of Ujjayini, capital of the western Satraps who were apparently the first to use a continuous era ( the Saka era ), and a method of date-recording which was at first purely Graeco-Chaldean as prevalent in Seleucid Babylon, but gradually Indian elements like the tithi and the naksatra were blended, as we find for the first time in the inscription of Satrap Rudrasimha, dated 181 A.D. (vide $ 5.5). 
This city of Ujjayini was later adopted as the Indian Greenwich, for the measurement of longitudes of places. The borrowal of astronomical knowledge was not therefore from Greece direct, but as now becomes increasingly clearer, from the West, which included Seleucid Babylon, and probably : through Arsacid Persia. The language of culture in these regions was Greek, and we therefore find Greek words like kendra fcentre), liptika (lepton), horā (hour) in use by Indian astronomers 
This view is supported by the Indian myth that astrolatry and astrology were brought to India by a party of Sakadvipi Brahmanas (Scythian Brahmins), who were invited to come to India for curing Samba, the son of Krşna, of leprosy by means of incantations 
· The five Siddhantas are : 
Paitāmaha Ascribed to Grandfather Brahma. Väsiştha Ascribed to the mythical sage 
Vasiştha, a Vedic patriarch, and 
revealed by him to one Mändavya. Romaka Revealed by god Vişnu to Rşi Romasa 
or Romaka. Paulisa · Ascribed sometimes to the sage 
Pulastya, one of the seven seers or patriarchs forming the Great Bear 
constellation of stars (but see later). Surya Revealed by the Sungod to Asura 
Maya, architect of gods, who 
propounds them to the Rşis. . The five Siddhantas are given in the increasing order of their accuracy according to Varahamihira. Thus Varahamihira considers the Sarya Siddhānta as the most accurate, and next in order are the Paulića, and the Romaka. The Vasiştha and Paitāmaha are, according to Varāhamibira, not accurate. 
Why were those Siddhāntas regarded as “Apaurus şeya" (i.e. not due to any mortal man) ? Dikşit says (Bharatiya Jyotiśāstra, Part II, Chap. 1): 
"The knowledge of astronomy as seen developed during the Vedic and Vedānga Jyotişa periods and described in Part I, was wide as compared with the length of the period ; but it is very meagre, when com pared with the present position***. The oldest of astronomical knowledge (given in the oldest Siddbāntas) reveal .a sudden rise in the standard of astronomical knowledge. . Those who raised the standard as given 
INDIAN-CALENDAR 
We need not go any further into the contents of this Siddhanta. As the name indicates, the knowledge was borrowed from the West, which was vaguely known as 'Romaka' after the first century A.D. The yuga taken is quite un-Indian, but appears to be a blending of the nineteen-year cycle of Babylon, the five-yearly yuga of Vedānga Jyotisa, and the number 30 which is the number of tithes in a month. The length of the year is identical with Hipparchos's (365.2467), and this alone of the Siddhāntas gives a length of the year which is unmistakeably tropical. . 
• The Romaka Siddhanta appears to represent a distinct school who tried to propagate western astro nomical knowledge on the lines of Hipparchos. One of the later propounders was Šrisena, who flourished between Aryabhaça and Brahmagupta ; the latter ridicules him roundly for having made a "kānthā”, i.ex a wrapper made out of discarded rags of all types meaning probably Srişena's attempt to blend two incongruous systems of knowledge, western and eastern. 
in these works were naturally regarded as superbuman. and hence the available ancient works on astronomy are regarded as: 'apauruşeya' i.e. not compiled by mortal men) and it is clear that the belief has been 
formed later". 
This statement, made by Dikşit nearly sixty years ago, really singles out only one phase of the issue, viz., the wide gulf in the level of astronomical knowledge of the Siddhantas and that in the Vedānga Jyotişa ; but leaves the question of actual authorship open. In our opinion the Siddhantas were regarded as Apauruşeya because they appear to have been com pilations by different schools of the knowledge of calendaric astronomy, as they diffused from the West during the period 100 B.C.-400 A.D. But let us look into them a little more closely. 
The Paitamaha Siddhanta : described in five stanzas in Chap. XII. of the Panca Siddhāntikā. 
As already discussed it is a revised edition of the Vedānga Jyotişa ,but later authors say that it contained rules for the calculation of motions of the sun, the. moon and also the planets which were not given by the Vedānga Jyotişa. As the full text of the original - Siddhanta has not been recovered, it is difficult to say 
how the borrowal took place. 
The Vasistha Siddhanta : as known to Varahamihira is described in 13 couplets in Chap. II of the Parica Siddhāntika. It describes methods of calculating tithi and nakşatra, which are inaccurate. Besides it mentions Rāśi (zodiacal signs), angular measurements, discusses length of the day, and the lagna (ascendant part of the zodiac). Apparently this represents one attempt by a school to propagate western astronomical knowledge, The school persisted and we have. Vāsiştha Siddhantas later than Varāhamihira. One of the most famous was Vişnucandra (who was somewhat later than Āryabhata) who was conscious of the phenomenon of precession of the equinoxes. No text of the Siddhanta is available, except some quotations. 
Varahamihira pays a formal courtesy to Paitāmaha and Vāśiştha; this does not prevent him from describing these two as 'dūravibhraştau', i.e., furthest from truth. 
The Paulisa Siddhanta : This Siddhānta 'was at one time regarded as the ival of the Sūrya Siddhānta, but no“ text is available now. But it continued to be current up to the time of Bhattotpala (966 A.D.), who quotes from it. 
Alberuni (1030-44 A.D.) who was acquainted with it, said that it was an adaptation from an astronomical treatise of Paulus of Saintbra, i.e., of Alexandria. But it.is not clear whether he had actually seen Paulus's treatise, and compared it with the Paulisa Siddhānta or simply made a guess on the analogy of names merely, The name of one Paulus is found in the Alexandrian list of savants (378 A.D.) but his only known work is one on astrology, and it has nothing in common with Paulisa Siddhāntā, which appears to have been purely añ astronomical treatise as we can reconstruct it from the Pañca Siddhāutikā (vide infra). The ascription to Paulus.of Alexandria is not therefore proved. There is, however, reference in the Paulisa Siddhanta to Alexandria, or Yavanapura, as it was known to Hindu savants. The longitudes of Ujjain, and Banaras are given with reference to Alexandria (P.S., Chap. III). 
The Pañia Siddhantikā devotes à few stanzas of Chaps. I, III, VI, VII, and VIII to this exposition of the Paulisa Siddhānta. Nobody seems to have gone critically into the contents of these chapters after Dr. Thibaut who tried to explain these in his introduction to the Panica Siddhāntika, but left most of them unexplained owing to their obscurity. 
In Chap. I. (verses 24-25), 30 Lords of the days of the month are mentioned. This is quite un-Indian 
The Romaka Siddhanta : The Romaka Siddhanta as reviewed by Varahamihira 
uses : 
A Yuga of 2850 years = 19 x 5x 30 years ; 
150 gears=54787 days ; 
1 year = 365.2467 «lays. The number of intercalary months in the yuga is given as 1050, i.e., there are 7 intercalarý months in 19 years. 
 
and reminds one of the Iranian calendar in which each one of thirty days of the month is named after a god or principle (see $ 2.3). The names of the lords of the days as given in the Paulisa Siddhanta are of course all Indian.

The Surya Siddhanta Of all the Siddhantas mentioned by Varāhamihira this alone has survived and is still regarded with veneration by Indian astrologers. This Siddhanta was published with annotations by Rev. E. Burgess, in 1860, and has been republished by the Calcutta University under the editorship of.P. L. Gangooly, with an intro duction by Prof. P. C. Sengupta. . 
This is supposed to have been described by the Şungod to Asura Maya, the architect of the gods, who revealed it to the Indian Rşis. These legends certainly represent some sort of borrowing from the West, but it would be fruitless to define its exact nature unless the text is more critically examined. Varāhamihira describes in Chapters IX, X, XI, XVI, XVII of the Panca Siddhāntikā the contents of the Surya Siddhānta as known to him ; they are somewhat different from those as found in the modern text. It appears that this Siddhanta was constantly revised with respect to the astronomical constants contained in it as all astronomical treatises should be. The text as we have now was fixed up by Ranganatha in 1603 after which there have been no changes. Burgess, from a study of the astronomical constants, thought that the final text referred to the year 1091 A.D. Prof. P. C. Sengupta shows that the S.S. as reported by Varahamihira borrowed elements of astronomical data from Aryabhata, and the S.S. as current now has borrowed elements from Brahmagupta (628 A.D.). 
The modern Surya Siddhanta is a book of 500 verses divided into 14 chapters, contents of which are described briefly below : 
Chap. I-Mean motions of the Planets. 
II–True places of the Planets. III-Direction, Place, and Time. IV-Eclipses, and especially Lunar 
Eclipses. V--Parallax in a Solar Eclipse, VI–Projection of Eclipses. VII—Planetary Conjunctions. VIII The Asterisms.. 
IX-Heliacal Risings and Settings. : 
X-Moon's Risings -and Settings, and 
the Elevation of her Cusps. XI-Certain malignant Aspects of the 
Sun and the Mocn. 
A scrutiny of the text shows that it is, with the exception of a few elements, almost completely astro nomical. A few verses in Chap. III, viz., Nos. 9-12 deal with the trepidation theory of the precession of equinoxes. These are regarded by all critics of the Surya Siddhanta to be interpolations made after the 12th century., 
It will take us too much away from our main theme to give a critical account of this treatise, but every critic has admitted that the text does not show any influence of Ptolemy's Almagest. Prof. P. C. Sen gupta's introduction is particularly valuable. This Siddhānta indicates that longitudes should be calculated from Ujjain and makes no mention of Alexandria. Prof. Sengupta thinks that it dated from about 400 A.D., but a scrutiny of the co-ordinates of certain stars marking the ecliptic, which we have discussed in Appendix 5-B, shows that it might have utilized data collected about 280 A.D., when the star Cierā la Virginis), was close to the autumnal equinoctial point, and is therefore subsequent to 280 A.D. 
The rules of framing the calendar are found in Chapter XII of which we give an account in the next section. 
After about 500 A.D., the Indian astronomers gave up the pretext of ascribing astronomical treatises to gods or mythical sages and began to claim authorship of the treatises they had written ; the earliest that has survived is that of Aryabhata (476—523 A.D.). The objects of their treatises were to frame rules for calendaric calculations, knowledge of astronomy forming the basis on which these rules were framed. 
In addition to the Surya Siddhanta only two other systems have survived, viz., 
The Arya Siddhanta-due to Aryabhata II, an astronomer of the 10th century, and supposed to be related to the Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata, who claims to have derived it from Brahmā, the Creator. 
The Brahma Siddhānta-vaguely related to the Paitāmaha Siddhānta, but the human authorship is ascribed to the celebrated astronomer Brahmagupta (628 A.D.). 
But a number of astronomical treatises like that of Siddhānta Širomani by Bhaskaracārya and many others, have survived either on account of their own merit or their connection with astrology.﻿INDIAN OALENDAR

The name Romaka vaguely refers to the capital of the Roman Empire. 'Yamakoți' is quite fanciful.

The Solar Calendar according to the 
Surya Siddhanta The first few verses of Chap. XII deal with the creation of the world according to Hindu conception, and the creation of the elements ; of the sun, the moon, and the planets. The universe is taken to be geocentric, and the planets in order of their decreasing distances from the earth are given as (vide verse 31,) : 
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury 
and the Moon. The fixed stars are placed beyond the orbit of Saturn. 
Surya Siddhānta, XII, Verse 32 Madhye samantāt daņdasya bhūgolo byomni tişthati Bibhrāṇaḥ paramām saktim brahmaño dbāraṇātmikāni. 
Translation : Quite in the middle of the celestial egg (Brahmānda), the earth sphere (Bhugola) stands in the ether, bearing the supreme might of Brahmā which has the nature of a self supporting force. 
The astronomers are thus conscious that the earth is a spherical body suspended in ether (byomni) 
Verse 34 : Describes the earth's polar axis, which passing through the earth's centre emerges as . mountains of gold on either side. 
Verse 35 : Gods and Rşis are supposed to dwell on the upper (northern) pole, and the demons are supposed to dwell on the nether (south) pole. 
Verse 43 : Describes two pole-stars (Dhruva-tārās) which are fixed in the sky. 
The author could have been aware only of the Polaris. By analogy he inferred the existence of a southern pole-star which, as is well-known, does not exist. He had apparently no knowledge of the sky far south of the equator. 
The remaining verses describe the equator . As in modern astronomy, it says that the polar star is on the horizon of a person on the equator and the co-latitude (Lambaka) of the equator is 90°. 
The Siddhāntic astronomers thus completely accepted the geocentric theory of the solar system. It was a great improvement on the ideas of the world prevalent in India at the time of the great epic Mahabharata (date about 300 B.C.), in which the earth is described to be a flat disc, with the Sumeru mountain as a protruding peg in the centre, round which the diurnal motion of the celestial globe carrying the stars, planets the sun and the moon takes place. This idea of the world is also found in the Jätakas and other Buddhist scriptures. 
• In the subsequent verses four cardinal points on the , equator are recognized, these are : 
Translation : In the half revolution beginning with Meşādi (lit. the initial point of Aries), the sun being in the hemisphere of gods, is visible to the gods, ; but while in that beginning with Tulādi (lit. the initial point of Libra) he is visible to the demons moving in their hemesphere. 
This means that when the sun reaches Meşādi, the initial point of the sign of Aries, the gods who are supposed to be in the north pole just witness the rising of the sun and has the sun over the horizon for six months. All these six months, the demons who are supposed to be at the south pole are in the dark. It is vice versa for their enemies the Asuras for whom, dwelling in the south pole, the sun rises for them when it is at Tulādi (beginning of the Tula sign i.e., first point of Libra) and remains above the horizon for six months. 
According to the S.S., therefore, the first point of Aries is coincident with the vernal equinoctial point, and the first point of Libra with the autumnal equinoctial point.

These quotations leave not the slightest doubt that according to the compilers of the S.S., the first point of the zodiac is the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, and the signs of the zodiac cover 30° each of the ecliptic. 
It is supposed on good grounds that much of the astronomical knowledge found in the Surya Siddhanta is derived from Graeco-Chaldean sources. But it is clear from the text that the compilers of the S.S. had no knowledge of the precession of equinoxes, but they took the first point of Aries to be fixed. This is not to be wondered at, for as shown in $ 4.9, inspite of the works of Hipparchos and Ptolemy, precession was either not accepted or no importance was attached to it by the astronomers of the Roman empire. It may be added that the compilers of the S.S. were not aware of the theory of trepidation of equinoxes which appears to have been first formulated in the West by Theon of Alexandria (ca. 370 A.D.). It is also important to note that the Indian astronomers did not take the first point of Aries to be identical with that given either by Hipparchos, Ptolemy or any other western authority as would have been the case if there was blind-folded borrowing. They assimilated the astro nomical knowledge intelligently and took the first point of Aries as the point of intersection of the equator and the ecliptic, and made successive attempts to determine it by some kind of actual observations, 28 shown in appendix 5-B. These observations appear first to have been made about 280 A.D. 
precession of the equinoxes, they were unaware of the distinction between the sidëreal year and the tropical year. They had to obtain the year-length either from observation or from outside sources. If they obtained it from observations, they must have counted the number of days passed between the return of the sun to the same point in the sky over a number of years. Such observations would show that the year had not the traditional value of 366 days given in Veranga Jyotişa, but somewhat less. In fact, the Paitāmaha length is 365.3569 days and there is no reason to believe that it was derived from foreign sources. Successive observations must have enabled the Indian savants to push the accuracy still higher.. 
Or alternatively they might have borrowed the value from Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, but we cannot then explain why their value is larger than Ptolemy's. We have seen that the Romaka Siddhanta gives a value which is Hipparchos's, and tropical, but the three more correct Siddhantas reject it, as being too small. This however indicates that they probably tried to derive the length from observations as stated in the previous paragraph and found the Romaka Siddhānta-length too small. If they had taken it from some other source, we have still to discover that source. It is certainly not Ptolemy's Almagest. 
The ex-cathedra style of writing adopted by the Siddhantic astronomers, e.g., the number of days in a Kalpa (a period of 4.32 x 10 years) is 1,577,917,828,000 according to Grandfather Brahmā, or the Sungod, does not enable one to trace the steps by which these conclusions were reached. 
The two problems of (i) distinguishing between the tropical year, and the sidereal year and of (ii) deter.. mining the correct length of the year in terms of the mean solar days are very exacting ones. 
We have seen how it took the West the whole time-period between 3000 B.C. to. 1582 A.D. to arrive at the idea that the true length of the tropical year was close to 365.2425 days. Probably Iranian astrono-. mers of Omar Khayam's time (1072 A.D.), who had the advantage of the great Arabian observations by al Baţțānī and others had a more correct knowledge of this length. The final acceptance of the distinction between the tropical and the sidereal year dates only from 1687 A.D., when Newton proved the theary of trepidation to be wrong. 
· The Siddhantic astronomers of 500-900 A.D. cannou therefore be blamed for their failure to grasp the two problems. But what to say of their blind followers who, in the twentieth century, would continue. to proclaim their belief in the theory.of trepidation ?

Length of the Year The length of the year, according to the different authorities are as follows..

days Varahamihira ... 3650 66 12m 369 = 365.25875 Current S.S. ..... 365' 6 12 36:56 <'365.258756 Ptolemy (sidereal) 365 6 9 48.6 a365.256813 Correct length of

N. B. Varāhamibira's length of the year is also found in Aryabhata's ārdharātrika, or midnight system, and in Brahmagupta's Khanda Khôdya ka. 
How did the Indianrants manage to have such a wrong value for the length of the year? 
The year, according to the Surya. Siddhanta is meant to be clearly tropical, but as the Indian savants compiling the S,S..were:ignorant of the phenomenon of 
INDIAN CALENDAR 
241 
(a) Starting the astronomical year from the moment the sun crosses the vernal: equinoctial point. 
(b) . Starting the civil year on the day following. 
The Siddhantic astronomers thus brought the Indian calendar on a line with the Graeco-Chaldean calendar prevalent in the Near East during the Seleucid times. 
In a few cases, e.g., in the case of the Vikrama era reckoning as followed in parts of Guzrat, the year. beginning is in Kārtika. This seems to be reminiscent of the custom amongst the Macedonian Greek rulers of Babylon to start the year on the autumnal equinox day. 
· Effect of continuance of the mistake The Surya Siddhanta value, viz., 365.258756 days is larger than the correct sidereal value by .002394 days and larger than the tropical length by .016560 days. 
As the S.S. value is still used in almanac-framing, the effect has been that the year:beginning is advancing by .01656 days per year, so that in course of nearly 1400 years, the year-beginning has advanced by 23.2 days, so that the Indian solar year, instead of starting on the day after the vernal equinox (March 22) now starts on April 13th or 14th. The situation is the same as happened in Europe, where owing to the use of a year-length of 365.25 days, since the time of Julius Cæsar, the Christmas preceded the winter solstice by 10 days, when the error was rectified by a Bull of Gregory XIII, and the calendar was stabilized by introducing revised leap-year rules. 
The Calendar Reform Committee has proposed that the Indian New Year should start on the day after the vernal equinox day. Most of the Indian calendar makers belong to the no-changer school, or the nirayaņa school (i.e., school not believing in the precession of the equinoxes). But this school does not realize that even if the sidereal length of the year be: acceped, the Indian year-length used by them is larger by nearly .0024 days, which cannot be tolerated. So if a change has to be made, it is better to do it whole-hog, i.e., take the year-length to be tropical, and start the year on the day after the vernal equinox. 
. This is the proposal of the Indian Calendar Reform Committee, and it is in full agreement with the canons laid down in the Surya Siddhanta. 
The First Month of the Year : This has to be defined with respect to the defini tion of the seasons. 
. According to modern convention, which is derived from Graeco-Chaldean sources, the first season of the year is spring ; it begins on the day of vernal equinox, as shown in fig. 25 which shows also the other seasons. The Indian classification of seasons is however, different as the following table shows. 
Historical Note on the Year-beginning 
The Indian gear, throughout ages, has been of two kinds, the solar and the lunar, each having its own starting day. The year beginning for the two kinds of years, for different eras, is shown in Table No. 27. , 
Table 15-—Indian Seasons. —30° to 30°...Spring (Vasanta) Caitra & Vaisākha 
30 to 90 ... Summer (Grişma) Jyaiştha & Aşadha 
90 to 150 ... Rains (Varşa) Srāvapai & Bhādra 150 to 210 ... Early Autumn (Śarat) Āøvina & Kārtika 210 to 270 .. Late Autumn Agrahāyaṇa & Panpa 
(Hemanta) 270' to 330 ...Winter (Sisira) Magha & Phālguna 
The Siddhantic astronomers, therefore, found themselves in a difficulty. If they were to follow the Indian convention, Caitra would be the first month of the solar year. If they were to follow the Graeco Chaldean covention, they had to take Vaisakha as the first month of the solar year. 
They struck a compromise. For defining the solar year, they took Vaisakha as the first month and for defining the lunar year they took Caitra as the first month (see $ 57). 
But this rule has been followed only in North India. In South India, they had different practices, as shown in the list of solar month-names (Table No. 16). 
In North India the first month is Vaisakha as laid down in the S.S. which starts just after sun's passage through the V.E. point. 
It is interesting to see that in Tamil Nad, some of the names are of Sanskritic origin, others are of Tamil origin. But the most siriking fact is that the first month, starting after vernat equinox is not Vaišākha as in the 
The Starting Day of the Solar Year In the Vedic age, the year-beginning was related "probably to one of the cardinal days of the year, but we do not know which cardinal day it was. The Vedānga Jyotişa started the year from the winter solstice day, Brāhmaṇas started the year from the Indian Spring (Vasarthe phen the tropical (Sāyana) "longitude of the sun amounted to 330°. 
The Siddhantic astronomers must have found a confusion, and so fixed up a rule for fixing the year. beginning, which we have just now dicussed. These rules amount to :

In Tinnevelley and Malayalam districts the solar , months are named after the signs of the zodiac. 
There is, therefore, no uniformity of practice in the nomenclature of the solar months, and in fixing up the name of the first month of the solar year. 
Solar Months : Definition: 
After having defined the solar year, and the year beginning, the Surya Siddhānta proceeds to define the "Solar Month." 
Surya Siddhānta, Chap. 1,13 Aindavastitþibbi-stadyat samkrāntyā saura' ucyate Māsairdvādaśabhirvarşam divyam tada harucyate. 
Translation : A lunar month, of as many lunar days (titha) ; a solar (saura) month is determined by the entrance of the sun into a sign of the zodiac, i.e. the length of the month is the time taken by the sun in passing 30° of its orbit, beginning from the initial point of a sign ; twelve months make a year, this is called a day or the gods. 
This definiton is accepted by the Ārya, and Brahma Siddhantas as well. 
The working of this rule gives rise to plenty of difficulties, which are described below : 
The mean length of a solar month 
= 30.43823 according to S.S. 
= 30.43685 according to modern data. 
The actual lengths of the different solar months, however, differ widely from the above mean values. This is due to the fact that the earth does not move with uniform motion in a circular orbit round the sun, but moves in an elliptic orbit, one focus of which is occupied by the sun, and according to Kepler's second law, it sweeps over equal areas round the sun in equal intervals of time. When the earth is farthest from the sun, i.e. at aphelion (sun at apogee) of the elliptic orbit, the actual velocity of the earth becomes slowest, and the apparent angular velocity of the sun becomes minimum, and consequently the length of the solar month is greatest. This happens about 3rd or. 4th July, i.e., about the middle of the solar month of Aşadha (Mithuna), and consequently this month has got the greatest length. The circumstances become reversed six months later on about 2nd or 3rd January, when the earth is nearest to the sun, i.e., at perihelion (sun at perigee), the angular velocity of the 
sun at that time becomes maximum, and consequently 
· the solar month of Pausa (Dhanuḥ) which is 
opposite to Aşadha, has got the minimum length. The following two figures ( Nos. 25 & 26 ) will explain the position. 
The durations of the different months, which are different from each other due to the above reason, are also not fixed for all time. The durations of the solar

made up of the precessional velocity of 50,"27 per year in the retrograde direction and the perihelion velocity of 11."62 per year in the direct direction due to planetary attraction. This movement of the apse line with respect to the V.E. point causes variation in the lengths of the different months. 
(ii) The second reason is that the ellipticity of the earth's orbit is not constant ; it is gradually changing. At present the eccentricity of the orbit is diminishing and the elliptic orbit is tending to become circular. As a result, the greatest duration of the month is diminishing in length and the least one increasing. Similarly the lengths of other months are also undergoing variation.

The modern elliptic theory of planetary orbits was Fig. 25 
not known to the makers of Indian Siddhantas, but 
they knew that the sun's true motion was far (i) the line of apsides of the earth's elliptic orbit 
from uniform. They conceived that the sun has (i.e., the aphelion and perihelion points) is not fixed 
uniform motion in a circle, with the earth not exactly at the centre of that circle, but at a small distance from it. The orbit therefore becomes an eccentric circle or an epicycle. Here also the .angular motion of the sun becomes minimum when at apogee or farthest from the earth, and maximum when 
nearest to the earth or at perigee. In this case the po frio)--- ----------44)-------- 
size and eccentricity of the circle are invariable quantities, and consequently the maximum and minimum limits of the months are constant. The apse line advances in this case also, but with a very slow motion, which according to the Surya Siddhānta 
amounts to a degree of arc in 31,008 years, or 11" in a Fig. 26 
century. The variations of the durations of months 
due to this slow motion of the apse line is quite in space but is advancing along the ecliptic at the negligible and the lengths of the months according to rate of 61".89 per year or 1.°72 per century. This is the Sūrya Siddhanta are practically constant over ages.

In the Sarya Siddhanta, a formula is given for finding the true longitude of the sun from its mean longitude. As the length of a month is the time taken by the sun to traverse arcs of 30° each along the ecliptic by its true motion, the lengths of the different months can be worked out when its true longitudes on different dates of the year are known. The true longitude is obtained by the Sūrya Siddhanta with the help of the following formula : 
True Long. - Mean Long.–133.'68 sin K 
+3.'18 sina K where K=Mandakendra of the sun, 
3.e., - mean sun-sun's apogee. 
Different convontions for fixing up the 
beginning of the solar month The samkranti oi ingress of the sun into the different signs may take place at any hour of the day. Astronomically speaking the month starts from that moment. But for civil purposes, the month should start from a sunrise ; it should therefore start either on the day of the samkrānti or the next following day according to the convention adopted for the locality. There are four different conventions in different States of India for determining the beginning of the civil month. 
Rules of Samkranti 
At the approximate time of each samkrānti, the true longitude of the sun is calculated by the above formula for two successive days, one before the attainment of the desired multiple of 30° of longitude and the other after it, and then the actual time of crossing the exact multiple of 30th degree is obtained by the rule of simple proportion. This is called the time of samkrānti or solar transit. The time interval between the two successive samkrāntis is the actual length of the month, The lengths of the months thus derived from the Sūrya Siddhanta compared with the modern values, s.c., the values which we get after taking the elliptic motion of the sun, and the shift of the first point of Aries are shown in Table No. 17, on p. 243, in which : 
Column (1) gives the names of months. 
... (2) gives the arc measured from the first 
point of Aries (the V.E. point) covered by the true longitude 
of the sun. (3) gives the lengths of the months 
derived from the Sūrya 
Siddhanta rules. (4) gives the correct lengths of the 
months as in 1950 A.D. (5) gives the corresponding names of the 
months as proposed by the Committee.. 
The Bengal rule : In Bengal, when a samkrānt: takes place between sunrise and midnight of a civil day, the solar month begins on the following day; and when it occurs after midnight, the month begins on the next following day, i.e., on the third day. This is the general rule ; but if the samkrānti occurs in the period between 24 minutes before midnight to 24 minutes after midnight, then the duration of tithi current at sunrise will have to be examined. If the tithi at sunrise extends up to the moment of samkrānti, the month begins on the next day : if the tithi ends before sainkrānti, the month begins on the next following or the third day. But in case of Karkata and Makara samkrantes, the criterion of tithi is not to be considered. If the Karkata samkrānti falls in the above period of 48 minutes about the midnight, the month begins on the next day, and if the Makara sankranti falls in that period, the month begins on the third day. 
The Orissa rule : In Orissa the solar months of the Amli and Vilayati eras begin civilly on the same day (sunrise to next sunrise) as the samkrānti, irrespective of whether this takes place before or after midnight.. 
The Tamil rule : In the Tamil districts the rule is that when a samkrānti takes place before sunset, the month begins on the same day, while if it takes place after sunset the month begins on the following day.. 
The Malabar rule: The rule observed in the North and South-Malayalam country is that, if the samkranti takes place between sunrise and 18 ghatikās 17h 12) or more correctly fth of the duration of day from sunrise (about 1-12 P.M.) the month begins on the same day, otherwise it begins on the following day. 
It will be observed that as a result of the different conventions combined with the incorrect month lengths of the Sarya Siddhānta we are faced with the following problems 
It would appear from table No. 17 that the lengths of the months of the Sūrya Siddhānta are no longer correct; they greatly differ from their corres ponding modern väliin sometimes by as much as 111 hours. The Surya Siddhānta values, which the almanac makers still use, are therefore grossly incorrect. Moreover, the lengths of the months are undergoing gradual variation with times due to reasons already explained.

... (1) the civil day of the solar month-beginning 
may differ by 1 to 2 days in different parts of India. 
(2) The integral number of days of the different solar months also vary from 29 to 32. 
The mouths of Kārtika, Agrahāyana, Pauşa, Māgha and Phālguna contain 29 or 30 days each, of which two months must be of 29 days, and others of 30 days. The months Caitra, Vaisakha and Asvina contain 30 or 31 days. 
The rest, viz., Jyaiştha, Āşādha, Śrāvana and Bhadra have got 31 to 32 days each, of which one or two months will contain 32 days every year. 
(3) The length of the month by integral number. of civil days is not fixed, it varies from year to year. 
from such rules vary from 29 to 32, which is very inconvenient from various aspects of civil life. 
The Committee has therefore felt that there is no need for keeping the solar months as astronomically defined. The length of 30 and 31 days are quite enough. for civil purposes. Moreover, fixed durations of months by integral number of days is the most convenient system in calendar making. The five months from the second to the sixth have the lengths of over 30 days, and so their lengths have been rounded to 31 days each ; and to the remaining months 30 days have been allotted. 
6.7 THE LUNAR CALENDAR IN THE SIDDHANTA 
: JYOTISHA PERIOD. 
Justification of the Solar Calendar as proposed 
by the Committee It has been shown that the intention of the maker of Sarya Siddhānta and of other Siddhantas was to start the year from the moment of sun's crossing the vernal equinoctial point and to start the civil year from the day following. The Committee has also adopted this view and proposed that the civil year for all-India use should start from the day following the V. E. day, i.e., from March 22. In the Vedic literature also it is found that the starting of the year was related with one or other of the cardinal days of the year. The Vedanga Jyotişa started the year from the winter solstice day, the Brāhmaṇas started the year from the Indian spring (Vasanta) when the tropical (Sayana) longitude of the sun amounted to 330°, but in the Siddhantic period the year-beginning coincided with the V. E. day. So in adopting the Sāyana system in our calendar calculations, the Indian tradition, from the Vedic times up to the Siddhantic times, has been very faithfully observed. This has ensured that the Indian seasons would occupy permanent places in the calendar. . 
As regards the number of days. per month, although the Surya Siddhānta defines only the astronomical: solar month as the time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of arc of the ecliptic, four different conventions have been evolved in different States of India for determining the first day of the civil month from the actual time of transit as narrated earlier. None of the conventions is perfect. Such rules do not yield fixed number of days for a month, as a result of which it becomes extremely difficult for a chrono logist to locate any given date of this calendar, unambiguously, in the Gregorian calendar, without going through lengthy and laborious calculations. Moreover, the number of days of months obtained 
The broad divisions of the year into seasons or months are obtained by the solar calendar, but since for religious and social puposes the lunar calendar had been used in India from the Vedic times, it becomes incumbent to devise methods for pegging on the lunar calendar to the solar. 
· The extent to which the lunar calendar affects. Indian socio-religious life will be apparent from the tables of holidays we have given on pp. 117-154. There the religious and social ceremonies and observances and holidays of all states and communities are classified under the headings :: 
(1) Regulated by the solar calendar of the Siddhāntas; 
(2) Regulated by Gregorian dates ; (3) Regulated by the lunar calendar. 
The tables show that by far the largest number of religious holidays and other important social ceremonies are regulated by the lunar calendar. It is difficult to see how the lunar affiliation, inconvenient as it is, can be replaced altogether, short of a revolution in which we break entirely with our past. The lunar calendar will therefore continue to play a very important part as we continue to keep our connection with the past, and with our cherished traditions. 
Let us now restate the problems which arise when, with reference to India, we want to peg the lunar calendar to the solar, how it was tackled in the past, and how the Calendar Reform Committee wants to tackle it. 
The lunar month consists of 29.5306 days and 12 such lunar months fall short of the solar year by 10.88 days. After about 2 or 3 years one additional or inter calary lunar month is therefore necessary to make up the year; and in 19 years there are 7 such intercalary months. In Babylon and Greece there were fixed rules 
246 
 
have been introduced. Taking the mean vaules of the lunation-period and of the length of the solaryear, the time when one extra month (i.e., intercalary month) will have to be introduced can easily be determined. But the luminaries do not move with uniform angular motions (throughout their period of revolution and so the determination af the intercalary month on the basis of the actual movement of the sun and the moon is a very difficult problem. The calculations according to the mean motions are however shown below. 
Table 18– Calculation of intercalary months in a 
19-year cycle. 
for intercalation ; the intercalary months appeared at stated intervals and were placed at fixed positions in 
the calendar (vide 8 3.2). It appears that some kind of 
· rough rules of intercalation of lunar months were 
followed in India up to the first or second century A.D. when the calendar was framed according to the rules of Vedānga Jyotéşa (vide § 5.4). Thereafter the Siddhantic system of calendar-making began to develop, replacing the old Vedānga calendar. 
The Vedanga calendar as we have seen was crude and was based on approximate values of the lunar and solar periods, the calendar was framed on the mean motions of the luminaries, and as such an intercalary month was inserted regularly after every period of 
30 months. 
The Siddhānta Jyotişa introduced the idea of true positions of the luminaries as distinct from their mean positions, and devised rules for framing the calendar on the basis of the true positions, and adopted more correct values for the periods of the moon and the sun. But some time elapsed before new rules were adopted, and intercalary months. continued to be calculated on the basis of the mean motions of the sun and the moon, employing however more correct values of their periods as given by the Siddhāntas. In this connection the following remarks by Sewell and Dikşit, in the Indian Calendar (p. 27) are worth noting. 
"It must be noted with regard to the intercalation and suppression of months, that whereas at present these are regulated by the sun's and moon's apparent motion,-in other words, by the apparent length of the solar and lunar months ---and though this practice has been in use at least from 1100 A.D. and was followed by Bhāskarācārya, there is evidence to show that in earlier times they were regulated by the mean length of months. It was at the time of the celebrated astronomer Srīpati (1039 A.D.) that the change of practice took place".

It would appear from the above figures that the 19-year cycle with 7 mala māsas is a better approxi mation if we adopt the tropical year, and the error gradually, increases with the sidereal year and the Surya Siddhānta year. In 11} cycles, i.e., in 220 years, the discrepancy would amount to only a day in the case of the tropical year. 
It is also seen that one intercalary month is to be added at intervals of 327 solar months, or in other words an intercalary month recurs alternately after 32 and 33 solar months. According to this scheme the intercalary months in a period of 19 years would be as follows:

Intercalary months or Malamasas. The length of the Surya Siddhānta year is 365.258756 days, and of a lunar month according to the S. S. is. 29.5305879 days. Twelve such lunar months fall short of the S. S. year by 10.891701 days. The lunar year therefore slides back on the solar scale each year by about 11 days. If the months were allowed to slide back continuously it would have completed the cycle in 33.5355 years, and the festivals attached to the lunar calendar would have moved through all the seasons of the year within this period, as now happens with the Islamic calendar.

INDIAN CALENDAR

But the makers of Indian calendars have not ; followed any scheme for intercalation based on mean motions. They evolved a plan for distinguishing an intercalary month from a normal month based on the true motions of the sun and the moon. This plan is. also followed in giving the name to a lunar month, as explained below : 
Siddhantic rules for the Lunar Calendar There are two kinds of lunar months used in India, the new-moon ending and the full-moon ending. In calendarical calculations only the new-moon ending months are used. 
(i) The new-moon ending lunar month covers the period from one new-moon to the next. This is known as amanta or mukhya candra māsa. It gets the same name as the solar month in which the moment of initial new-moon of the month falls. For this purpose the solar month is to be reckoned from the exact moment of one samkrānti of the sun to the moment of the next sankranti. When a solar month completely covers a lunar month, i.e., when there are two moments of "new-moon (amānta), one at the beginning and the other 
at the end of a solar month, then the lunar month beginning from the first new-moon is the intercalary month, which is then called an adhika or mala māsa, and the lunar month beginning from the second new moon is the normal month which is termed as śuddha or nija in the Siddhāntic system. Both the months bear the name of the same solar month but are prefixed by adhika or śuddha as the case may be. In an adhika month religious observances are not generally allowed. . If on the other hand, a lunar month completely covers a solar month, no new-moon having occurred in that solar month, the particular lunar month is then called a kşaya or decayed month. : As the mukhya or new-moon ending lunar month begins from the Amavasyā or the new-moon occurring in the solar month bearing the same name, the lunar month may begin on any day during that solar month -it may begin on the first or even on the last day of that solar month. : ? (ii) The full-moon ending lunar month known as pūrnimānta or gauna čāndra māsa, covers the period from one full-moon to the next, and is determined on the basis of the corresponding new-moon ending month as defined above. It begins from the moment of full moon just a fort-night before the initial new-moon of an amānta month, and it also takes the name of that month, 
...But in the gaunamāna (i.es, full-moon ending lunar month), as the month starts 15 days earlier than the 
new-moon ending month, it may begin on any day during the last half of the preceding solar month and the first half of the solar month in question. It will therefore be seen that wbile the new-moon ending or mukhya month sometimes falls almost entirely out side (i.e., after) the relative solar month, the full-moon ending or a gruna month always covers at least half of the solar month of that name. 
The months used for civil purposes in the Hindi calendar are the full-moon ending lunar months, and are sub-divided into two halves-krsna pakşa covering the period from full-moon to new-moon and termed as vadi, and sukla pakşa covering the period from new moon to full-moon and termed as sudi. As these months, are on the gauna māna, the vadi half of a month comes first followed by the sudi half. The last day of the year is therefore a full-moon day, the Phalguni (or Holi ) Purnima, in keeping with the ancient Indian custom. 
The Samvat and Saka years in the Hindi calendar begins with Caitra sukla Pratipad. For astronomical purposes, however, the year begins a few days later with the entrance of the sun into Meşa. 
The calendars of Āşādhi Samvat and Kārtiki Samvat are, on the other hand, based on the new-moon ending months, and consequently the months begin 15 days later than the months of the Caitrādi full-moon ending calendar. The Āsādhi calendar begins with Aşādha Sukla 1, and the Kārtiki calendar with Kārtika Sukla 1. 
The table (No. 20 on p. 249) shows the scheme of the different calendars for the year Saka 1875 (1953-54). The year contains a mäla or adhika month. 
It may be seen from the above mentioned table that in case of the light half of the month (sudi half) the month has the same name for the two systems of month-reckonings, but in the dark half of the month 
(vadi half) the names of the months in the two systems are different. 
The year-beginnings of the Samvat era in the three systems of luni-solar calendar are also different, as may be seen from the following table.

RAPORT OF THE CALENDAR BEFORM COMMITTEE 
Counting of the Succession of Days, In all the calendars used in India, days are counted according to the solar reckoning, as well as according to the lunar reckoning (i.e. by tithi or lunar day). But there is a difference in emphasis. 
adhika'. For example if the third tithi is - repeated, then the sequence of days of the half-month would be 
1, 2, 3, 3 adhika, 4, etc. 
Some improvement in the use of tithi for dating purposes is, however, observed in the Fusli calendar in vogue in some parts of Northern India. In this calendar the month begins from the day following the full-moon and dates are counted consecutively from 1 to 29 or 30 without any break at new-moon, or any gapping or over-lapping of dates with kşaya tithi or adhika tithi. In fact the dates of this calendar have no connection with tithis after the starting of the month has been determined. The year of Fusli begins after the full-moon day of lunar Bhadra 
e 
In the eastern regions (Bengal, Orissa and Assam), and in Tamil Nad and Malabar, the solar reckoning is given more prominence. The almanacs give solar months and count the days serially from 1 to 29, 30, 31 or 32 as the case may be. · The tithi endings are given for every day, and the tithi may start at any moment of the day. 
In other parts of India (except Bengal, Orissa, Assam and Tamil Nad), the counting of days is based on the lunar reckoning, and the number of the tithi current at sunrise is used as the ordinal number of the date necessary in civil affairs. So there are 29 or 30 days in a month, but the days are not always counted serially from 1 to 29 or 30. 
The month in the lunar calendar is divided into two half-months, the sudi and vadi halves in the new moon ending system, and the radi and sudi halves in the full-moon ending system. In fact the year is divided into 24 half-months instead of 12 months. So there are 14 to 15 days in a half-month (vide Table 20). 
The tithi or lunar day. is measured by the positions of the moon and the sun. When they are in conjunc tion, i.e., at new-moon the 30th tithi or amāvasyā ends and the first tithi starts which continues upto the moment when the moon gains on the sun by 12° in longitude. Similarly when the difference between the moon and the sun is 24o the second tithi ends, and so on. The average duration of a tithi is 236 37.m6, but the actual duration of a particular tithi undergoes wide variations from the above average according to the different positions of the sun, the moon and the lines of their apsides. . It may become as great as 266 47m and as small as 19h.59m. So generally to every day there is a tithi. But sometimes a tithi begins and ends on the same civil day, and such a tithi is dropped ; and some religious ceremonies of auspicious character are not allowed to take place on such a tithi, and the following day begins with the next following tithi. For example, if the third tithi is dropped, the sequence of days of the half-month is 1, 2, 4, 5 etc., thus the serialitas broken here. 
As opposed to the above-mentioned case, the tithi sometimes extends over two days, there being no tithi ending in a day (from sunrise to next sunrise). As the same tithi remains current on two successive sunrises, the same tithi-number is allotted to both the days ; In the second day, however, it is suffised by the term 
Mala Masa and Købaya Masa It has been stated befcre that even at the beginning of the Siddhanta Jyotişa period, the intercalary months (mala or adhika) were determined on the basis of the mean motions of the sun and the moon, and as such there was no possibility of the occurrence of any so called kşaya or decayed month. But as already mentioned, from about 1100 A.D., the intercalary months are being determined on the basis of the true motions of the luminaries, s.e., on the actual lengths of the new-moon-ending lunar month and of the different solar months as obtained from Siddhantic rules. This gave rise to the occurrence of kşaya months, and the intercalary months were also placed at very irregular intervals. 
The period from new-moon to new-moon (the lunar month ) is not a period of fixed duration ; it varies within certain limits according to the different positions of the apse line of the lunar and solar orbits, as follows :

Comparing these values with the actual lengths of solar months given in Table 24, it is observed that the minimum length of the lunar month falls short of all the solar months, even of the shortest month of Pausa. But as a mala māsa is not possible in that month, the maximum and minimum limits of the lunar months are recalculated for each of the solar months from Kartika to Phälguna separately,﻿INDIAN CALENDAR

Comparing the above limits with the actual leagths of months stated before, it is found that the minimum length of the lunar month falls short of all the solar months except Pauşa. So a malamasa or intercalary month is possible in all the months. except the mouth! of Pausa only.

The maximum duration of a lunar month, on the other hand, exceeds the lengths of the solar months only in case of solar Agrahāyanan Pausa and Māgha. So a kşaya month is possible only in these three months. 
A list is given below showing the actual intercalary months occurring during the period Saka 1823 (1901-2 A. D.) to Saka 1918 (1996-97 A. D.) on the basis of Sūrya Siddhānta calculations.

According to the Siddhantic rules, the lunar calendar is pegged on to the solar calendar, and so it is the luni-solar calendar with which we are at present concerned. It has already been shown that the length of the Sūrya Siddhanta year is greater than the year of the seasons (i.e., the tropical year) by about 24 minutes. As a result of this the seasons have

REPORT OF THE CALENDAR REFORM COMMITEE 
The apparent antiquity of certain eras, ė.g., the Kaliyuga or the Saptarsi, are however rather deceptive," for these eras are not mentioned either in the Vedic literature or even in the Mahābhārata ( a work of the 4th to 2nd century B.C.). The best proof, however, that no eras were used in date-recording in ancient India is obtained from "Inscriptions" which give 'con temporary evidence of the method of date-recording in use at the time when the inscription was composed. 
In India, the oldest inscriptions so far discovered and deciphered satisfactorily are those of the Emperor Asoka (273 to 227 B.C.); for the earlier Indus valley seal recordings have not yet been deciphered and no inscriptions or seals which can be referred to the time period between 2500 B.C. (time of Indus valley civili zation) and 250 B.C. ( time of Asoka ) have yet been brought to light. Asoka mentions in his inscriptions only the number of years elapsed since his coronation. No month, week-day or the serial number of the day in the month is mentioned. A typical Asokan ins cription giving time references is given in $ 5.5. 
Continuous eras first began to be used in the re cords of the Indo-Scythian kings who reigned in modern Afghanistan and North-Western India beta ween 100 B.C. to 100 A.D. 
What is then the origin of the Kaliyuga or Saptarsi era given in Table 27 which go back to thousands of years before Christ? We are going to show presently that they are extrapolated eras invented much later than the alleged starting year. 
It is clear from historical records that date-recor ding by an era in India started from the time of the Kuşana emperors and Saka satraps of Ujjain. But India cannot be singled out in this respect, for none of the great nations of antiquity, vix., Egypt, Babylon, Assyria or later Greece and Rome, used a continuously running era till rather late in their history. The introduction of the era is connected with the develop ment of the sense of 'History' which came rather late to all civilized nations. 
centuries in the total period of the cycle. Each cen tury is named after a naksatra, viz., Afrint, Bharani, etc ; and the number of years within the century is generally mentioned, so that the number of year of the era never exceeds 100. This era was in use in Kashmir and neighbouring places. In fact this era has no relation with the seven Rsis (the Great Bear) in the sky or with any actual naksatra division. There is difference of opinion as to the beginning of the era. According to Vrddha Garga and the Puranas the. starting year of the tenth century named after Magha are 3177 B.C., 477 B.C. and 2224 A.D. of the different cycles, when according to Varahamihira the third century named Krttikā begins. The beginning years of Varahamihira's Magha century of the different cycles are however 2477 B. C., 224 A. D. and 2924 A.D. 
The Pandava Kala or the Yudhisthira era started from 2449 B.C. according to Varahamihira. 
The so-called Yudhisthira era (2449 B.C.) is given by Kalhana, chronicler of Kashmir (1150 A.D.), who quotes the date from VỊddha Garga, an astronomer whose time is unknown. This era also does not occur in any inscription or any ancient treatise prior to Kalhana (1150 A.D.). Prof. M. N. Saha has shown that in the Mahābhārata the Krttikās are in many places taken as the first of the nakşatras and are very nearly coincident with the vernal equinox. If we calculate the date of the M.Bh. incidents on this basis, the date comes out to be very nearly 2449 B.C. - 
It, however, niether proves that the incidents mentioned in the M.Bh., if they were actual occurrences, took place in 2449 B.C., for the epic was, not certainly put to writing before 400 B.C. as we know from a verse already mentioned on p. 226. It is inconceiveable to think that the dates could be remembered correctly for over 2000 years, when writing was in a very primitive state. The astro nomical references in the battle scenes, from which certain writers very laboriously deduce the date of these occurrences, are most probably later interpola tions, on the supposition that the incidents occurred about 2449 B.C. There is no inscriptional record regarding the use of Yudhişthira era or Pandavakāla.

Critical Examination of Indian Eras 
Here we are examining critically the claims of a few eras, which was supposed to date much earlier, e.g., the Kaliyuga era whico is commonly believed to have been introduced in 3102 B.C., the Saptarsi era, and the Pandara-Kala mentioned by Kalhana, the historian of Kashmir, who wrote in 1150 A.D., and supposed to be dating from 2449 B.C., and others. 
The Saptarsi era commoly known as Lokakalá or Laukika Kala is measured by centuries and has 27 sach 
(a) The Kaliyuga Era 
· It is easy to show that the Kaliyuga era which purports to date from 3102 B.C. is really an extra polated: era just like the Christian era, introduced long long after the supposed year of its beginning. 
It is first mentioned by Aiyabbata, the great i stronomer of ancient Påtaliputra, who says that'.3600 
INDIAN QALENDAR 
years of the Kaliyuga had passed .when he was 23 years old which is Saka year 421 (499 A. D.). It is not mentioned earlier either in books or in inscriptions. 
The first mention of this era in an inscription is found in the year 634-35 A.D., the inscription being that of king Pulakesin II of the Calukya. dynasty of Badam!, or somewhat earlier in a Jain treatise. It was most probably an era invented on astrological grounds just like the era of Nabonassar, by Aryabhata or some other astropomer, who felt that the great antiquity of Indian civilization could not be described by the eras then in use (Saka, Chedi or Gupta era), as they were too recent. 
What were these astrological grounds ? The astrological grounds were that at the beginning of the Kaliyuga, the sun, the moon and the planets were in one zodiacal sign near the fixed Siddhantic Meşadi which according to some authorities is Ś Piscium, but according to others is 180° from Citrā or a Virginis. This was probably a back calculation based on the then prevailing knowledge of planetary motion, but has now been found to be totally wrong, when recalculated with the aid of more accurate modern data on planetary motion. We quote from 
Ancient Indian Chronology, pp. 35-39 by Prof. P. C. Sengupta, who has given a full exposition of Burgess's views on this point, with recalculations of his own. 
should also be a total eclipse of the Sun ; but no such things happened at that time. The beginning of the Kaliyuga was the midnight at Ujjayini terminating the 17th February of 9102 B.O., &ccording to Sūrya Siddhanta and the ārdharātrika system of Aryabhata's astronomy as described in the Khandakhädyaka of Brahmagupta. Again this Kaliyuga is said to have begun, according to the Aryabhatiya from the sunrise at Lankā (supposed to be on the equator and on the same meridian with Ujjain)—from the mean sunrise on the 18th Feb., 3102 B.O. . 
Now astronomical events of the type described above and more specially the conjunction of the sun and the moon 
cannot happen both at midnight and at the next mean : sunrise. This shows that this Kaliyuga had an upreal 
beginning. . The researches of Bailey, Bentley and Burgess have : shown that a conjunction of all the 'planets' did not happen at the beginning of this Kaliyuga. Burgess rightly observes : 'It seems hardly to admit of a doubt that the epoch (the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyuga) was arrived at by astronomical calculation carried backward. 
We also can corroborate the findings of above research e rs in the following way and by using the most up-to-date 
equations for the planetary mean elements. 
Now the procession of the equinoxes from 3102 B. C. to 499 A.D. or Aryabhata's time works out to have been = 49° 32' 39". The mean planetary elements at the beginning of the Kaliyuga, i.e., 17th Feb., 3102 B.C., Ujjayini mean time 24 hours, are worked out and shown below. We have

"Astronomical Kaliyuga an Astronomical Fiction" 
At the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyuga, all the mean places of the planets, viz., the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and tuturn, are taken to have been in conjunction at the beginning of the Hindu sphere, the moon's apogee and her ascending node at respectively a quarter circle and a half circle ahead of the same intial point. Under such a conjunction of all the planets, there 
added 49° 32' 39" to these mean tropical longitudes arrived at from the rules used, so as to get the longitudes measured from the vernal equinox of Aryabhạta's time. 
Hence we see that the assumed positions of the mean planets at the beginning of the astronomical Kaliyugá were really incorrect and the assumption was not a reality. But of what use this assumption was in Aryabhata's time, i.e., 499 A.D., is now set forth below.' 
254 
 
Aryabhata says that when he was 23 years old, 3600 years of. Kali bad elapsed. According to his Ārdharātrika system: 
3600 years - 1/1200 of a Mahāyuga=1314931.5 days. Again according to his Audayika system :. 
3600 years=1/1200 of a Mabāyuga=1314931.25 days. 
Honce according to both these systems of astronomy of Aryabhata, by counting 3600 years from the beginning of the astronomical Kali epoch, we arrive at the date March 21, 499 A.D., Ujjayini mean time, 12 noon. The unreality of the Kali epoch is also evident from this finding. However, the position of mean planets at this time work out an given in table 26 below. 
about 57 B. C. Moreover a critical examination of inscriptions show the following details about this era. 
The earliest mention of this era, where it is definitely connected with the name of king Vikrakoso ditya is found in an inscription of one king Jaikadeva who ruled near Okhamandal in the Kathiawar Statêi The year mentioned is 794 of Vikrama era, i.e., 737 A.D.' In a subsequent inscription, dated 795 V.E. it : is also called the era of the lords of Malava. So the Vikrama era and the era of Malava lords are one and the same. Tracing back, we find the Malavagana era in use by a family of kings reigning at Mandasor, Rajputana between the years 461-589 V.E., as feuda

INDIAN CALENDAR 
Rajasthan, conquered the city of Kanauj about 828 A.D., they brought the Vikrama era from their original home, and it became the current era all over northern India except the eastern region, and was used by all Rajput dynasties of medieval times. . 
The months of the Vikrama era are all lunar, and the first month is Caitra. The months begin after the full-moon but the year begins 15 days after the full moon of Phalguna, i.e. after the new-moon of Caitra. But for astronomical calculations, it is pegged on to a solar year, which starts on the first of solar Vaisakha, theoretically the day after the vernal equinox. The Vikrama era is current also in parts of Gujrat, but there the year begins in Kārtika and the months are amänta, which corresponds to the Macedonian month of Dios, and the epoch is just six months later. Thus the western and northern varieties of the Vikrama era follow respectively the Macedonian and Babylonian reckonings (see $ 3.3), the year of starting is 255 years later than that of the Seleucidean era. 
The conclusion is that the champions of the Vikrama era have still to prove the existence of king Vikrama of Ujjain. Early inscriptions show that the method of date-retording is not typically Indian as in the Satavahana inscriptions but follow the Saka-Kuşāņa method, which follows the contemporary . Graeco Chaldean method. It was therefore a foreign recko ning introduced either by the Greeks or Sakas, or an Indian prince or tribe who had imbibed some Graeco-Chaldean culture, but was adopted by the Malava tribes who migrated from the Punjab to Rajas than about the first century B.C. . The association with a king Vikrama occured 800 years later, and is probably due to lapse of historical memory, for the only historical king Vikramaditya who is known to have crushed the Saka power in Ujjain, was king Candragupta II of the Gupta dynasty (about 395 A.D.). Before this, the Saka dynasty in Ujjain had reigned almost in unbroken sequence from about 100 A.D. to 395 A.D., and had used an era of their own, later known as the "Saka' era. All the Gupta emperors from Samudragupta, had an "Aditya" title, and many of them had the title "Vikramaditya" so that the Gupta age was par excellence the age of Vikramadityas. But all the Gupta emperors use in their inscriptions the family era called the Guptakala which commemorated the foundation of Gupta empire (319 A.B). The association of the Malava era with king Vikramaditya, and assignment of king Vikramaditya to Ujjain, was due to confusion of historical memory not infrequent in Indian history. It may be mentioned that the Vikrama era is never used by Indian astro nomers for their calendaric calculations, for which puapose the Saka era is exclusively used. 
(e) Tho Saka Bra The Saka Era is the era par excellence which has been used by Indian astronomers all over India in their calculations since the time of the astronomer Varaha mihira (died 587 A.D.) and probably earlier. The Indian almanac-makers, even now, use the Saka era for calculations, and then convert the calculations to their own systems. 
This era is extensively used over the whole of India except in Tinnevelly and part of Malabar, and is more widely used than any otber era. It is also called Saka Kala, Saka Bhapa Kala, Sakendra Kala, and Salivabana Saka and also saka Samvat. Its years are Caitrādi for luni-solar reckoning and Meşādi for solar reckoning. In the luni-solar reckoning the months are pūrnimântă in the North and amāntā in Southern India. The reckoning of the Saka era begins with the vernal equi nox of 78 A.D., and is measured by expired years, so the year between the vernal equinox of 78 A.D. to that of 79 A.D. is zero of Saka era. In some pañcangais of Southern India the current year is however seen to be used instead of the elapsed year, where the number of year of the era is one more than the era in general use 
But we are not yet sure about the origin of this era. It has been traced back to the Saka satraps of Ujjain, from the year 52 (130 A.D.) to the end of the dynasty about 395 A.D. But in their own records, they merely record it as year so and so, but there is not the slightest doubt that the era used by them subsequently became known as the Saka era (ride: 5.5) 
The Old and the New Saka era. The dates given by different authorities about the starting year of the old Saka era mentioned in $ 5.5 vary from 155 B.C. to-88 B.G. as given below: Konow : 88 B.C. (date of death of Mithradates II, the 
powerful Parthian emperor who is 
said to have subjugated the Sakas). Konow has proposed a number of other dates. Jayaswal : 120 B.C. : Herzfeld : 110 B.C. : Settlement of the Sakas in 
..Seistan by Mithradates II. Rapson : 150 B.C. : Establishment of the Saka 
kingdom of Seistan. Tarn : 155 B.C. : Date of settlement of the Saka 
immigrants in Seistan by 
Mithradates I. Recently Dr. Van Lohuizen de Leeuw has discus sed the starting point of this era in her thought-provok ing book The Scythian Period of Indian History'. She bas Tejected all the above dates, and fixed up 129 B.C. as the starting date of the old Saka era. She identifies this year as the one in which the Śakas, descending from the Trans-Oxus region, attacked the Parthian empir

in which the Parthian emperor Phraates II was defea- ted and killed, and the rich. province of Bactria was occupied by the Sakas. They founded an era to com memorate their victory over the Parthians which their successors took to India, as they expanded and put an end to the Bactrian Greek principalities in Afghanistan and north-west Punjab. She suggests that the old Śaka era was also used by the Kuşanas, who were after all a Sakish ruling tribe, but from the time of Kaniska with hundreds omitted. 
Dr. M. N. Saba has supported this theory in its main features, but he thinks that the era was founded in 123 B.C., for he shows from historical records that the Sakas assailed Bactria first in 129 B.C. and entered into a seven year conflict with the Parthians, and finally. conquered Bactria in 123 B.C., when the Par thian' emperor Artabanus II, was defeated and killed. Probably the Sakas then founded their era. This was also called the era of Azes. Dr. Van Lohuizen, de Leeuw has accepted Saha's suggestion. 
This hypothesis, though not finally settled appears to, have a good deal of probability, for the following reasons : . 
The points given in $ 5.5 and above may be summarized as follows: 
(a) The Sakas starting from Central Asia attacked the Parthian empire in 129: B.C., and overcame Parthian resistance by 123 B.C. : It is very probable that they started an era to commemorate their accession to power in Bactria from 123 B.C. They used Macedonian months and Graeco-Chaldean methods of calendaric. calculations as prevalent in the Seleucid and Parthian dominions, Probably the era was some times named after Azes, who was probably their leader. But this Azes is not to be confounded with later Azes I or Azes II, who reigned in Taxila between 40 B.C. and 20 B.C. Within the first 200 years of its starting, the era was alternatively called the Azes era, 
(b) This Saka era ( known to archaeologists as the old Śaka era ) was used by the Saka emperors and Saka satraps in their Indian territories, but the time reckoning began to be gradually influenced by Indian customs. They began to use Indian months alter natively with Macedonian months and Parnimānta months in place of Amanta months. During the first 200 years, the hundreds were sometimes omitted, in the use of the era. : (c) The so-called Kaniska era is nothing but the old Saka era with 200 omitted. 
(d) The Śaka era was used by the house of Castana of Ujjain with 200 omitted, but gradually they forgot the origin of the era and continued their own reckoning without further omission of hundreds upto the end of the Saka satrapal rule over Ujjaini about 395 A.D. As the early Indian astronomers were mostly of foreign origin (viz. Sakadvipi Brahmana) the astronomical reckonings necessary for compiling the calendar were carried out using the Saka era and Graeco-Chaldean astronomy. The blending of Graeco-Chaldean astronomy as known about the early years of the Christian era with older Indian calendarical features formed the basis of Siddhanta Jyotişa. The Sakadvipi Brahmins also brought to India horoscopic astrology using the Saka era exclusively in horoscopes, a custom which has persisted to this day. These facts explain the pre-eminence of the Saka era. 
Dr. Saha points to the fact that Indian classics, which can be dated from the third century B.C. to the second century A.D., mentions three' races in what is modern Afghanistan and N. W. India, viz., the Sakas, the Yavanas, and the Pallavas, who attained to the status of ruling races. The order in which they are mentioned denotes correct chronological sequence, for they are arranged in the order of their chronological appearance in history, the Sakas being mentioned as a subject race in Darius's inscription (518 B.C.). But the Yavanas (Greeks) were the first to attain the status of a ruling race, from 312 B.C., the date of foundation of the Seleucid empire, whose power in the west was overthrown by the Parthians, or Pehlevis (Pallayas of Indian classics) in 248 B.C. 
(d) Other Eras 
Both these ruling races of Yavanas and Pallavas used eras of their own, viz., the Seleucidean era from 312 B.C., and the Parthian era from 248 B.C. Did the third race, viz., the Sakas who were the last to attain status of a ruling race ever use an era of their own ? It would be surprising if they did not, for it became the fashion for all races, who attained the status of ruting people, to have eras of their own. The early Sakas, -as their records stroge were deeply influenced by their neighbours to the west, viz., the Parthians who adopted Greek culture, and their coin-records show that they also adopted Greek culture, and therefore most probably, the Graeco-Chaldean method of date recording.

After the introduction of Tarikh Nahi, the people of Bengal began to use the Sarya Siddhānta reckoning, and the solar year. The Bengali San had thus a hybrid origin; to find the current year of the Bengali San, we take Hejira year elasped in 1556, i.e., 963 and add to it the number of solar years. Thus 1954 A. D. is 963 A.D.+(1954-1556)=1361 of Bengali San. 
era = 1270 A.D. Most of the antiquarians however put the date of Nirvāna in 483 B.C. The origin of the Buddha Nirvana era used in Ceylon has not yet been satisfactorly explained. . 
The Gupta Era :--This era was clearly \established by the founder of the Gupta dynasty (Candragupta I) to commemorate the accession to imperial power of his family, about 319 A.D., and was in vogue over the whole of Northern India from Saurashtra to Bengal during the days of their hegemony (319 A.D.-550 A.D.). · After the decay of their empire, the era was continued by their former vassals, the Maitrakas of Vallabhi and was in use in parts of Guzrat and Rajputana up to the thirteenth century. Its use in Bengal was discon tinued from about 510 A.D. with the disappearance of Gupta rule first in South Bengal, then over the whole of Eastern India. In the Uttar Pradesh (ancient Madhyadeśa), it was driven out by the Harșa era, which had a short period of existence, 606-824 A.D., when the city of Kanauj was occupied by king Nagabhata of the Pratibar dynasty, who hailed from Rajasthan. The Pratibārs brought with them the Vikrama era, which had been current in Rajasthan, and this became the great era of the north, used by all medieval Rajput dynasties, except those belonging to the eastern region.

es 
Eras in Eastern India 
Most parts of Bengal were under the Gupta emperors, and used the Gupta era during their hegemony (319-510 A.D.). But Gupta rule disappeared as mentioned above from major parts of Bengal from ca. 510 A.D., and the subsequent dynasties including the Pala emperors ( 750 A.D.-1150 A.D.) used regnal years in their inscriptions for four hundred years of their rule. The Saka era in Bengal appear to have been introduced by the Sena dynasty which replaced the Palas; the Senas were migrants from the south (Karnata-Kşatriyas ), where they were familiar with the Saka era, but it was not used in royal records which continued to use regnal years. The Vikrama Samvat never became popular in Bengal, or Eastern India. After Mohamedan conquest, Bengal was left without an era. For official purposes, Hejira was used, but the learned men used the saka era, and the common people in certain parts used a rough reckoning, 
Other hybrid eras A number of other hybrid eras formed in a similar 
· way to Bengali San is mentioned in the table (No. 27): 
Amli and Vilayati in Bengal and Orissa, the various Fasli or harvest years in Bengal, Deccan, and Bombay. 
All the other eras mentioned as hybrid in the chart were formed in a similar way, and the slight differences are due to mistakes in calculation, or differences in the time of introduction. While the Bengali San has Meşadi . as year-beginning, others have taken the year-beginning to be coincident with some important mythical event of local provenance, e.g., the year-beginning of the Amli era used in Orissa, viz., the 12th lunar day of the light half of the month of Bhadra is said to represent the birth date of king Indradyumna, the mythical king who is said to have discovered the site of modern Puri. The great temple of Puri was actually built by king Anyanka Bhim Dev of the Gangã dynasty about 1119 A.D., and kings of this dynasty who held sway in Orissa from 1035-1400, A. D. used the Ganga era, 
The Kollam era prevalent in the Malayalam countries is of obscure origin. The year of this era is known as the Kollam Andu. The era is also called the Era of Paraśurāma, and is said to have omitted thousands from their previous reckonings. In South Malabar it begins with the solar month Simha and in North Malabar with the solar month Kanya. The era started from 825 A.D. 
The Jovian cycle : In Southern India the years are named after the name of the Jovian year and so it also serves the purpose of an era of a short period, viz., 60 years, after which the years recur. Details about Jovian years will be found in Appendix 5-E.

The Seasons 
We have seasons because the celestial equator is oblique The amount of daylight received at any place determines to the sun's path (or the ecliptic), or in modern parlanoo, the season. When we have maximum sunlight, we have the axis of rotation of the earth is not perpendioular to its the bot season. When we have minimum sunlight, we shall orbit, but inclined at an angle of 661. This causes varying have winter. The other seasons come in-between. Bain, amounts of sunlight to fall on a particular locality through frost, etc., are secondary effects produced by varying out the year. If the earth's axis were perpendicular to the amounts of sunlight, and of the atmospherio conditions ecliptic, in other words the obliquity were zero, overy stimulated by the sunlight received. The sun is the sole portion of the earth from the equator to the pole would Srbiter of the seasons. have had 12 hours of sunlight, and- 12 hours of shade. Hence the definitions of seasons as given by the ancient There would have been no seasons on any part of the earth, astronomers, whether Western and Indian, which base them just as we have now for places on the earth's equator, whore on the cardinal days of the year, are the only correct, we have no variation of geason throughout the year, because definitions.

correctly. It is now known that they all used the gnomon. Measures of the length of the different seasons and of the year by some of their eminent astronomers are given in the table (No. 30) below. 
The Chaldeans must have also measured the length: of the year by the same method, either somewhat earlier or simultaneously with the early Greeks, but their names, excepting those of a few have not survived. But if in reality, the nineteen-year cycle was of as early as 747 B.C., they must have arrived at & correct length of the year much earlier than any other nation. 
The Length of the Seasons : The lengths of geasons were found exactly in the same way as in the case of the year, e.g., in the case of Spring, by counting the number of days from the day next to the vernal equinox day to the summer solstice day. The number would be variable from year to year, but a correct value was found by taking the observations for a number of years and taking the mean. The lengths obtained by early astronomers &re : 
the sun orossed the summer solstice (Juno 22), as is evident from the lines in Kalidasa's Meghadata or Cloud-Mogbangor.

Translation : When the sun just reversed'its motion after going (continuously) to the north, and began to proceed in the direction inhabited by departed souls (dakşipāyana), the whole sky was overcast with clouds (i.o., the monsoon set in) ;. ......... 
. Winter solstice get in with the month of Tapas, which means penance. The winter solstice as mentioned above was the time from which the yearly sacrifices started. 
The month names in the last column of table (No. 29) are ‘lunar', bụt they were linked to the solar months. They are now in universal use all over India to donote solar as well as lunar months ; but the two varieties are distinguished by the adjectives 'Solar' or 'Lunar'. 
Both the European and Indian definitions of seasons are scientific as they are based on the cardinal days. The difference in nomenclature is trivial. 
Table 30. Spring Summer Autumn Winter Total

The ancients early discovered that the seasons were of unequal length, but they were ignorant of the physical reasons. These exact definitions of seasons, both in India and in the West, were arrived at very early, and are very important for accurate calendar-making ; but the true meaning of those definitions were forgotten in the succeed ing periods in India. 
In Europoan astronomy, which is derived from Graeco Chaldean astronomy, we have : 
Spring 0° - 90° from V.E, to 8.8. Summer 90°-180° .8. to ANE. Autumn 180°—270° A.E. to W.8. 
Winter 270°—360° • W.8. to V.E. According to this scheme, the Rainy season consisting of months of Nabhas and Nabhasya formally set in when 
The Length of the Year : The length of the year, as mentioned earlier, must have been found by counting the number of days from one equinox to another, or one solstice 'to another. 
In actual practice, the number of days of the year, counted in this way would vary between 365 and 366. In the early stages, the length of the year was whole-numbered, but Indians of Vedāng& Jyotiga period had a year of: 366 days. Later when they came to a rigorous definition of the year, they realized that the number of days was not whole, but involved fractions.. Probably the attempt at determin ing the exact length of the year involving fractional numbers was obtained by adding up the lengths for & number of years, and taking the mean.

of Libra, the epooh comes out to be 286 A.D., and the. corresponding Vornal point 2° to the west of Ptolemy's. 
This analysis shows that the Indian astronomers had arrived at the idea that the equidoctial point should be properly located with reference to some standard stars and there were probably three attempts, one about 286 A.D., the next about 500 A.D., and the last one about 570. A,D. They had not accepted the first point given by Ptolemy or any western astronomer. 
The compiler (or compilers) of the S.S. was clearly anconscious of the procession of equinoxes, and while in his .. report, he made a selection of these da tau, he did not perceiro that they were inconsistent with the idea of a fixed V.E. point. 
But he did not err on the fandamental point. He had clearly laid down that Meşādi, i.e., the first point of Aries from which the year was to be started was to be identified with the vernal equinootial point.. 
It is to be noticed that though the laker of the 8. 
B us absorbed many of the ideas from Greek astronomy including the use of technical terms like horā, liptikā, kendra, etc., ho did not either blindly copy the Graeco-Chaldean data. From whichever source he might have got the ideas. he absorbed it correctly and made an attempt to fix up the actual V.E point, as required in Chaldean astronomy, otherwise his zero-point would have been coincident with Ptolemy's. We have shown that whatever the Hindu zero-point of the zodiac might be, it is not coincident with that of Ptolemy.

For holding these views these (Dhruvaka and Vikşepa) with respect to this as the initial astronomers were roundly abused by Brahmagupta whose point.

Translation 1. While the celestial bodies move in the sky from north to south and again from south to north, a very small variation takes place in their doolination. 
2. The (ascending) node in which the celestial equator and the ecliptic intersect is the first point of Aries (Meşādi), and it gives the 'Esst'. Tha second node is the first point of Libra (Tuladi), and these two points never change their declination value (which is zero). . . . 
3. The first point of Cancer (Karkadi) is at a distance of three signs (i.e. 90°) from it, and at a distance of three signs in the reverse order is the position of the first point of Capricorn (Makarādi). These give the positions of maximum declination which is 24 degrees. 
4. The solstitial points (which mark the ayanas) show a movement, and the number of their revolutions in a Kalpa is counted as 199669. 
The last passage recognizes processional motion, says that it is continuous, and gives the rate as 59".9 per year. Muñjāla Bhata makes no mention of trepidation. He noticed that the Ayanas had precessed by about 6° from the position given in the Sūrya-Siddhānta. 
Přthūdaka Svāmi (born 928 A.D.), an astronomer who observed at Peibowa, near Kuruksetra, commenting on a passage of Brahmagupta says : 
"The revolution of Ayana in one Kalpa is 189411. 
This is called the Ayana Yuga". This passage recognizes the continuous nature of precessional motion, and gives the rate of precessional motion as 56".82 seconds per year. 
So far we have no mention of the 'Theory of Trepidation.' This is first mentioned in the Arya Siddhānta, ascribed to Aryabhata II, whose date is 1028 A.D. It says : Ayanagrabadoh krāntijyācāpam kendravat dhanarna i syāt Ayànalavāstat samskệta khețādayana carāpamalagpāni. 12. 
Translation : -Find the sine declination (krāntijyā) of the ayanagraha (in a way similar to that of the sun's declination); from it deduce the amount of declination, plus (north) or minus (south), which is the amount of ayanāmša.* After applying this ayanāinsa-correction to the planet, the values of cara (half the difference between the lengths of day and night), declination of planets, lagna (the orient ecliptic point), etc., are to be calculated. 
This has been interpreted as follows (Dikşit, p.330). 
The equinox oscillates between #24°, and the number of rovolutions of the Ayana-planet in a Kalpa is 578159, which gives the period 8-royolution as 7472 years and the annual rate of motion as 173"4. During & quarter period viz., 1868 years, the ayananša increases from 0° to 24°, at first, rapidly, then gradually more slowly like the increase of 
declination of the sun. Thereafter it diminishes in like manner and after the lapse of 3736 years, i.e. the half period, it again becomes zero and goes on the other side. The annual rate of motion, which on the average amounts to 46.3 seconds, varies from t 70'-5 to 0" 
Wo now come to a very controversial passage in the modern Sūrya Siddhanta, Chap. III, verses 9 to 12. 
These are : 
Trimsat kftyo yuge bhānāṁ cakram prāk parilamvate tadgunād bhūdinairbhaktāt dyaganāt yada bāpyate. 9 
Taddostrighnā dašāptāmśā vijñeyā ayanābhidhāḥ tatsamskstādgrahāt krānticchāyā caradalādikam sphutan dʻktulyatāṁ gacchedayane viguvadvaye. 10 Prāk cakram calitam hine chāyārkāt karaṇāgate antarāmsai rathāvștya pascacchegaistathādbike. 11 Evaṁ vişuvaticchāyā svadese yā dinārdhajā daksinottara rekbāyām gā tatra vişuvat prabhā. 12 
Translation 9. In an Age (yuga), the circle of the asterisms (bha) falls back eastward thirty score of revolutions. Of the result obtained after multiplying the sum of days (dyugana) by this number, and dividing by the number of natural days in an Age, 
10. Take the part which determines the sine, multiply it by three, and divide by ten ; thus are found the degrees called those of the precession (ayana). From the longitude of a planet as corrected by these are to be calculated the declination, shadow, ascensional difference (caradala) etc. 
11. The circle, as thus corrected, accords with its ob served place at the solstice (ayana) and at either equinox ; it has moved eastward, when the longitude of the sun, as obtain ed by calculation, is less than that derived from the shadow. 
12. By the number of degrees of the difference ; then, turning back, it has moved westward by the amount of difference, when calculated longitude is greater. 
These verses occur in the chapter on astronomical measurements by the gnomon, and are misfits there ; according to all authorities, these verses did not exist in the original Sūrya-Siddhānta, but have been extrapolated there, and have no reference to the context of the chapter. The extrapolation must, however, have taken place before the time of Bhāska rācārya II (1114-1178 A.D.), because he comments on this passage. 
The passage supports the theory of trepidation and says that the amplitude of processional oscillation is 27o and the period of one complete oscillation is stated to be 7200 years. The rate of procession is given as 54" per year, which is uniform and the same throughout the oscillation. These stanzas are quoted by Indian astrologers who are advocates of the nirayana system, in support of their arguments for sticking to the sidereal year. They say that the present ayanāmśa is about 22°, and r. will go on precessing for another 350 years till ayanāmsa bocomes 27o and will then turn back on its return journey. 
the This is a technical term used by Indian astronomers to denote the distance of the vernal point from the fixed Hindu Zodiac.﻿INDIAN CALENDAR 
269 
This is sufficient argument to them to turn down all proposals for Sayana reckoning taking the length of the year to be tropical. 
We now take the opinion of the last great Indian astronomer Bhāskarācārya II (1150 A.D.). 
He uses the term 'Sampāt-Calana' i.e., movement of the intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, instead of the classical term Ayana. He says : 
Siddhānta Siromani, Goladhyāya, 
Golabandhādhikāra Tasya (vişuvatkrāntivalayapātasya] api calanamasti. Yo'ayanacalana bhāgāḥ prasiddhāsta ova vilomagasya 
krāntipātasya bhāgāḥ Translation :--It (the equinox) 'has also movement. What is commonly known as the amount of procession (ayanām śa) is the same as the longitude of the equinoctial point measured backwards. 
This evidently shows that he regarded the change as due to the retrograde motion of the node (i.e. equinoctial point) like modern European astronomers. 
He criticises Brahmagupta for his views on Ayana Calana and says: “One can observe that at the time of Brahmagupta, the ayanāmśa value was very small and hence it is likely that it could not have come to his notice ; yet how is it that he did not take the rate of revolution of oquinoxes as given by the Sūrya-Siddhānta, just as he has taken figures for rates in some other cases on the basis (or authority) of already proved and accepted rates". 
He further says : Ayanacalanam yaduktam Muðjālādyaiḥ sa evāyam 
(krāntipātah) tatpakşe tadbhaganāḥ kalpe go'rgartu-nanda-go-candrāḥ 
(199669). 
Atha ca yo vā to vā bhaganāḥ bhavantu yadā yo'msa nipuņairupa labhyante tadā sa ova krāntipātaḥ. 
Translation :-"What Muðjāla and others have mention ed as 'Ayano Calana', is nothing but the motion of this .. equinoctial point. According to their view the number of revolution in a Kalpa is 199669 (yielding annul rate of 59".9). Let whatsoever be the number of revolutions, whatever amount is obtained by expert observers is the angle of precession for that time.” 
From this it is clear that he recommends one to accept the ayandinsa which one would actually get by observation of sun's place at any particular time. Dīkşit says : 
I have not come across single statement in which Bhāskarācārya has clearly said that equinoctial point makes a complete "circular revolution", nor does be say that "it does not make it”. 
He has taken 1 minute per year as the ayana-motion and has supposed 11° as the gyanāmša in Saka 1105. He thus means to take Śaka 445 as the zero-precession year. 
We thus perceive that Indian astronomers up to the time of Bhāskarācārya were as much divided in their ideas about precesssion of the equinoxes as the contemporary Arab astronomers of the West (Hispano-Muslim), and the East. It is only after 1024 A.D. that they adopted a theory of trepidation. The earlier-astronomers like Muñjāla and Pșthūdaka merely noticed precession and gave their own rates for it. Bhāskarācārya is non-committal about trepidation. The Indian astronomers do not appear to have been influenced by the views of the western astronomers, the earlier Greeks or later Arabs. 
It will be sheer stupidity to hold to the theory of trepidation of equinoxes 270 years after it has been definitely proved to be wrong. The law of universal gravitation will not be changed by God Almighty to oblige astrologers. 
APPENDIX 5-E The Jovian Years 
(Bärhaspatya Varşa) 
The sidereal period of Jupiter, according to the surya Siddhanta is 4332.32 days which is nearly 11.86 sidereal years. Therefore Jupiter roughly stays for one year in one zodiacal sign, if we calculate by mean motion. 
This was taken advantage of to devise & cycle of 12 Jovian years. If we divide the Sarya-Siddhānta period by 12, we get 361.026721 days which is takon as the length of & Jovian year. This is 4.232 days less than the Sūrya Siddhanta solar year. So if & Jovian year and an ordinary solar year begin on the same day, the Jovian year will begin to fall back, completing a complete retrogression in 8501solar years, according to the Sūrya-Siddhānta. 
. The sixty-year cycle is at present'in daily use in Southern 
India (south of Narmada) where each year (the solar year or the luni-solar year) is named after that of the corresponding Jovian year. The years are counted there in regular succes sion and no samvatsara is expunged. This practice is being followed since about 905-06 A.D. (827 Saka), as a result of wbich the number of North-Indian Samvatsara has been gradually gaining over that of the South from that time. The Saka year 1876 (1954-55 A.D.) is named 41 Plavanga in the North while in the South it is 28 Jaya. 
65 
So 85,96 solar years=86.96 Jovian years, and one Jovian 
ULS, & 
211 
year is expunged in every 85 
years. The expunged year 
is called the Kşaya year. In actual practice, the interval between two expunctions is sometimes 85 and sometimes 86 years. 
There was indeed at one time a period of 12 Jovian years, but at some past epoch, a fivefold multiple, a cycle of 60 Jovian years, each with a special name suffixed by the word 'Samvatsara', came into use. 
The following are the names of the different years : (1) Prabhava (21) Sarvajit (41) Plavaiga (2) Vibbaya (22) Sarvadhārin (42) Kila ka (3) Sukla · (23) Virodhin (43) Saumya (4) Pramoda (24) Viksta (44) Sādhāraņa (5) Prajāpati (25) Khara (45) Virodhakrt (6) Angiras (26) Nandana (46) Paridhāvin (7) Srimukha (27) Vijaya (47) Pramādin. (8) Bhava (28) Jaya (48) Ananda (9) Yuvan (29) Manmatha (49) Rākşasa (10) Dhātri (30) Durmukha (50) Anala (Nala) (11) Išvara (31) Hemalamba (51) Pingala (12) Bahudhānya (32) Vilamba (52) Kālayukta (13) Pramāthin (33) Vikārin (53) Siddhārthin. (14) Vikrama (34) Sarvari (54) Raudra (15) Vrga (35) Plava (55) Durmati (16) Chitrabhānu (36) Subhakrt (56) Dundubhi (17) Subhānu (37) Šobbana (57) Rudhirodgārin (18) Täraņa (38) Krodhin (58) Raktākşa (19) Pārthiva (39) Viśvāvasu (59) Krodhana (20) Vyaya (40) Parābhava (60) Kşaya (Aksaya) 
The beginning of the Jovian years is determined by the entry of Jupiter into an Indian sign by mean motion, the 1st, 13th, 25th, 37th and 49th years being marked by the entry of Jupiter into the sign Kumbha, and not Meşa which is otherwise the first of the signs of the Siddhāntas. It thus appears that the system of counting Jovian years is a pre-Siddhāntic practice
