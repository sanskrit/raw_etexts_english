It’s interesting to note during the genesis of Urdu as a distinct
language to be used as a competitor to Persian in the courts, poets like
Zuhur Ad-Din “Hatim” in 1757 deliberately weeded out Hindi/Hindavi words
from the lexicon & standardized the orthography to be Perso-Arabic

To add some context, Hindī, Hinduī and Hindavī were the terms used for
the local language, as distinct from the Persian used by the Muslim
elite. This was the term used by Amir Khusrau in the 13th century &
Fakhr ad-Din Gazhnawi who made a “Persian-Hindavi” lexicon

This Hindavi was taken to the Muslim courts of South India, where it
took on the familiar form of Dakkani literature. Later on, Dakkani was
claimed as the heritage of Urdu. However, in the 14-15th century,
Persian was patronized in the north. The term Urdu did not yet exist.

It was only in the 1700s, the name Urdu-e-mu’alla “Exalted Camp” was
coined and applied to the idiom of Hindavi being used with Persian,
Arabic lexicon. Siraj Ad Din “Arzu” in 1720 wrote an exclusive
Urdu-Persian/Arabic/Turkish dictionary to further this standardization.
