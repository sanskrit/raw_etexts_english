Jayadeva was a great court poet of the sena rājā lakṣmanasena, a dynast
of the last hindu rulers of bengal before the mohammedan onslaught.
Although Gita Govinda is his most famous work, there are some 30 other
verses attributed to him. Below is presented one such one. In the
context of the time when it was written (Bakhtiyar Khilji had taken
Bihar, Bengal was likely the next) it comes off as prophetic.

कल्की कल्कं हरतु जगतः स्फूर्जदूर्जस्वीतेजा  
वेदोच्छेदस्फुरितदुरितध्वंसने धूमकेतुः ।

येनोत्क्षिप्य क्षणम् असिलतां धूमवत् कल्मषेच्छान्  
म्लेच्छान् हत्व दलितकलिनाकारि सत्यावतारः ॥

“May Kalki destroy the sinfulness of the world. A comet thundering forth
mighty radiance for destroying those who would propagate sin by wrecking
the Veda; he lifted the vine of his sword for a second and slashing away
like smoke those mlecchas whose desires are sinful, effaced the blemish
of the kali age, and incarnated righteousness.”
