Many months ago, someone asked me “Can we simplify Sanskrit for the
masses?” the presumable goal being the creation of a Sanskrit-Hindi
hybrid that is easier than Sanskrit to learn with an artifically
constructed grammar but much closer to it than either Pali Prakrit or
Modern Hindi. At the time, I flat out rejected such a proposition,
thinking spoken (sarala-saMskRta) had already been ironed out enough
from it’s rich Vedic flexibility and grammatical system. However, I have
been thinking of how such a “Nava-Sanskrit” would look like if
hypothetically speaking the GOI decided to create such a language. What
would our primary objective of simplifying Sankrit by bending grammar
be? Why would this help?

Well, naturally it would help to construct a language that is quite
close to Sanskrit but still at a distance from it’s Classical or Vedic
past. It would certainly make the jump to Classical and then Vedic much
easier. It would be easier to learn and easier to adopt as a spoken
language. It would also be fun to study (for some!). My proposition
would be taking the base of MSH and adopting it parallell to
developments in Pali Prakrit but with a far more Sanskritized
phonology.  
  
Some thoughts on this.  
  
**Phonology**  
  
We keep the phonological inventory of MSH (Modern Standard Hindi)
intact. The voiced, voiceless aspirate series and the retroflexes. This
is the easiest part, because MSH phonology is nearly identical to
Classical Sanskrit. I propose **ऋ** to be pronounced in the MIA (Modern
Indo-Aryan) tune of /ri/ or /ɾu/ as it usually is. The sibilants should
keep their orthography (be written as they are) but in pronounciation, श
and ष would both be pronounced as श (as they even are nowdays).  
  
One modification would be avoiding schwa deletion & schwa fronting as
done in Hindi. So, राम would not be the /ɾɑːm/ of Hindi but contain a
final schwa as in /ɾɑːmə/. This is all we deviate from Sanskrit
Phonology. So unlike Pali, we stay very conservative here (just as MSH
does) and this is what gives it the the “Sanskritic/Sanskritized”
feel.  
  
Now, where MSH does \*not\* stay conservative is it’s verbal system and
noun morphology. Here is where we must make the biggest changes.  
  
**Gender & Number**  
  
I propose a total drop of the Neuter gender. We follow this up with a
total drop of every neuter pronomial adjective or pronoun and merge all
neuter nouns with masculine ones. We also drop the dual entirely, and
all dual pronomial adjectives. We express dual numbers by using the
indeclinable द्व “two/both”  
  
**Voice**  
  
I propose we do keep the two voice of Sanskrit intact, however the usage
of the middle should be for passive forms. (So we get rid of the passive
stem and conjugation entirely). We get rid of middle meanings as
reflexive or intensive and use them just for passivity.  
  
**Copula**  
  
Here, we keep the Sanskrit copula in the present & imperfect tenses
intact ‘√अस् – अस्ति/सन्ति’ or ‘आसीत्/आसन्’ intact (albeit irregular as
it is).  
  
**Verbal System**  
  
1. Only two stems (present & future) are kept along with **3 verb forms
(present, past, future) and 4 moods** (indicative, imperative, optative,
conditional).  
  
So, to be clear nava-saMskRta would have **लट्** (present) **लङ्**
(past) **विधिलिङ्** (optative) **लोट्** (imperative) **लृट्** (future)
**लृङ्** (conditional) lakAra-s respectively.  
  
We totally get rid of **लुट्** (periphrastic future) **लिट्** (perfect)
**लुङ्** (aorist) **आशीर्लिङ्** (benedictive). We also get rid of the
secondary systems **entirely** **णिच्** (causative) **यङ्** (intensive)
**सन्** (desiderative).

The conditional is unnecessary you might say, however it is very easy to
form and will be regularized totally. A periphrastic formation as in
Hindi “kiyA hotA” would be more cumbersome than a simple “abhaviSyat”  
  
So we have 2 stems. The present stem will form \*everything\* except the
future tense & conditional mood. You dont need to worry about any other
stem.  
  
We also totally get rid of “seT” roots.  
  
**Noun Declensions**  
  
We keep 7 cases of Sanskrit minus the dual number. However, we simplify
the number of declensions a lot.  
  
We have  
1) masculine -अ and feminine –आ  
2) ई/इ (identical in both genders and long/short).  
3) उ/ऊ (identical in both genders and long/short).

I propose dropping \*all\* consonant (-s, -ant, -tavant) declensions.
They will all be declined in accordance to the -a/-ā forms with an added
schwa at the end completing the vowel.  
  
**Pronouns**  

With the declensions simplified a lot, this will be much easier. We drop
all neuter pronouns as discussed above and keep the masc/fem forms. I
also propose a total drop of distance demonstratives “इयम्/अयम्” and
instead using just “एषः/एषा” for “this”. The honorific is भवान (no
feminine form) and declined like -a masculine nouns.  
  
1) सः – masculine/ सा feminine (3rd person personal pronoun)  
2) अहम् – 1st person personal pronoun  
3) त्वम् – 2nd person personal pronoun  
4) भवान – honorific “आप of Hindi”  
5) एषः/एषा – masculine/fem “this”  
6) यः/या – relative pronoun “who/whom” (Hindi – जो)  
7) कः/का – interrogative pronoun “who?/whom?” (Hindi – कौन​)  
  
The 3PPP “सः” also does double duty as a distal demonstrative “that” Now
keep in mind, I have maintained gender differences in these. It’s a bit
harder than Hindi but that’s okay.  
  
**Verb Formation/Classes**  
  
We drop the athematic verb classes and verb formation **\*completely\***
there is no redpulication. We just use a very regular stem formation
method.  
  
We drop all gaNa-s from 1 to 10 except तुदादिः gaNa. So **every single
verb stem** (Except a few exceptions like the copula) is formed by
taking the root, adding “-a” as gaNa in a weak stem strength.  
  
We keep same endings as Sanskrit but regularize all of them.  
  
Example:  
  
√अद् – अत​ (stem) – अत्ति “He eats” (stem + ti ending)  
√रुद् – रुत (stem) – रुत्ति “He cries” (stem + ti ending)  
√सु – सव​ (stem after sandhi) – सवति “He presses” (stem + ti ending)  
  
Let’s look at some sentence formation in comparison with Sanskrit, Hindi
and English  
  
English: The boy plays  
Sanskrit: saḥ bālaḥ krīḍati  
Nava-Sanskrit: saḥ bālaḥ krīḍati  
Hindi: vah bālak kheltā hai  
  
English: The two boys are playing.  
Sanskrit: tau bālau krīḍataḥ  
Nava-Sanskrit: tāḥ dva bālāḥ krīdanti  
Hindi: vah do bālak khelte hain  
  
English: The boys are playing.  
Sanskrit: tāḥ bālāḥ krīḍanti  
Nava-Sanskrit: tāḥ bālāḥ krīḍanti  
Hindi: ve bālak khelte hain  
  
So far we have established a decent framework for such a new language if
possible. We will look at participles in the next post. (and **real**
sanskrit but spoken simply.)
