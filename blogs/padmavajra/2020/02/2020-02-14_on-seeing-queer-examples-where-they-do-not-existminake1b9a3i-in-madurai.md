Before I begin,may my speech be blessed by Dakṣīṇāmūrti,that noble fount
of wisdom,who wears ornaments of both the sexes in His ears,signifying
His eternal union with Śaktī.

While the author of this article appreciates the good work done by
Srishti in Madurai and Gopi Shankar Madurai,there are a number of points
in their(or their organization’s article) which he feels is not
accurate,and which he feels the need to set right.

-   The author shall refrain from commenting about some of the
    sculptural evidence that the blog author there has noted,due to his
    not having seen them/not having examined them by an expert in
    iconography,notably
    -   Neutrois theme in Kala Samhara deity. The deity, typically with
        a male like body, and represented with lack of any sexual organ
        typically represents a MTN (Male to Neutrois) person.
    -   The Sanishwara deity which is the well known Transgendered deity
        can be seen in the temple
-   The author does not discount the possibility of erotic carvings in
    temples which depict homosexual acts.
-   Mīnākṣī being three breasted is not a sign of gender variance. It is
    one of those sort of tales in which a being loses his/her unique
    features when they meet a special person(example is Shishupala who
    was born with three eyes and four arms). Similarly She lost Her
    third breast when She met Śiva(whom She would marry).
-   Also Ardhanārīśvara is not really a gynandromorph condition….it is
    more of an ‘consciousness as impartial observer'(Puruṣa)-‘everything
    as the power inherent in that consciousness'(Prakṛti) represented in
    one mūrti. Gynandromorphs don’t exist in humans.
-   Harihara as a deity does not fit in the Procrustean bed of gender
    ideology in any way. The deity merely represents the concept that
    ‘śivāya viṣṇurupāya śivarūpāya viṣṇave'(Śiva is a form of Viṣṇu and
    Viṣṇu is a form of Śiva) along with injunctions that they must never
    be thought of in any manner except as equal and always both very
    respectful of each other.
-   Sri Pitchandavar=A Tamil name of Bhīkṣaṭana Rudra. As far as I
    know,there is nothing in His iconography that indicates any third
    gendered status. The main feature of His form is supreme
    attractiveness,and which is used in certain tantric rites of
    vaśikaraṇa(causing attraction of a girl to a boy or vice versa).
-   Bhagavān Vīrabhadra=The author would be very interested in knowing
    about any upāsana krama of this deity that involves being third
    gendered,and until one can provide that reliably,one fails to note
    what is third-gender about Vīrabhadra. He is a guru figure(cited
    from the Raurava Āgama) and greater than a hundred rudras(Mṛgendra
    Āgama). He is the personified wrath of Rudra,who taught the Gods
    through his violent actions through the greatness and centrality and
    glory of Rudra. In this author’s limited experience He was
    worshipped by mostly wandering Jangama ascetics and Lingadhari
    brahmins in Andhra. All that is required to approach Him is
    initiation in His mantras,which,to the best knowledge of the author
    do not have any bearing on the sex of the person who is being
    initiated.
-   Also,Arjuna ended up in that condition of Brihannala due to a
    *curse* by the apsara Uruvashi(which was reduced by Indra to just
    the duration of one year),which implied that that condition in the
    times that story was told would be less than a normative/ideal/good
    one.
-   People who weren’t straight or non-trans,etc were generally kept at
    a distance in society,though not explicitly harmed:The author is
    right in this one aspect,definitely.

People who are Gender and Sexual Minorities should make their case using
well supported evidence,not evidence that is flimsy(at best) on closer
examination to earn the good will of Hindus who know and internalize the
understanding of śāstra,and can hope for the best for their dignity in
the larger society.
