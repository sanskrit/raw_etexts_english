MAYAVATI,  
HIMALAYAS,  
*15th January, 1901*.

MY DEAR STURDY,

I learn from Saradananda that you have sent over Rs. 1,529-5-5 to the
Math, being the money that was in hand for work in England. I am sure it
will be rightly used.

Capt. Sevier passed away about three months ago. They have made a fine
place here in the mountains and Mrs. Sevier means to keep it up. I am on
a visit to her, and I may possibly come over to England with her.

I wrote you a letter from Paris. I am afraid you did not get it.

So sorry to learn the passing away of Mrs. Sturdy. She has been a very
good wife and good mother, and it is not ordinarily one meets with such
in this life.

This life is full of shocks, but the effects pass away anyhow, that is
the hope.

It is not because of your free expression of opinion in your last letter
to me that I stopped writing. I only let the wave pass, as is my wont.
Letters would only have made a wave of a little bubble.

Kindly tender my regards and love to Mrs. Johnson and other friends if
you meet them.

And I am ever yours in the Truth,

VIVEKANANDA.
