## CI

*To Sister Nivedita*

14, GREYCOAT GARDENS  
WESTMINSTER, S.W.

*5 December 1896*

DEAR MISS NOBLE —

Many thanks for sending the kind present from Mr. Beatty. I have written
to him acknowledging his beautiful gift.

As for you, my dear, noble, kind friend, I only would say this — we
Indians lack in many things, but there is none on earth to beat us in
gratefulness. I remain,

Ever yours gratefully,  
VIVEKANANDA
