## XVI

NEW YORK,  
*25th April, 1894*.

DEAR PROFESSOR (Prof. John Henry Wright),

I am very very grateful for your invitation. And will come on May 7th.
As for the bed — my friend, your love and noble heart can convert the
stone into down.

I am sorry I am not going to the authors' breakfast at Salem.

I am coming home by May 7th.

Yours truly,

VIVEKANANDA.
