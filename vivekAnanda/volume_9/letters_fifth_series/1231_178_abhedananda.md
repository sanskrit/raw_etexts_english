## CLXXVIII

*To Swami Abhedananda*

102 E. 58TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,

*24 July 1900*.

DEAR ABHEDANANDA,

I would have gladly remained here, but *sastây kisti mât*.[1](#fn1) Got
a fine berth — one room all to myself — on a fine vessel.[2](#fn2) As
soon as August comes it will be a terrible Bhida \[crowd\] as the
companies are reducing prices.

Things are going quite all right. Mr. Johnson has returned to their
house, and all the rooms are full except two. You write to Mrs. Crane
whether you want to get them or not.

You need not feel the least anxiety about the N.Y. work; it will go as a
marriage bull next season. Give my love to Mrs. \[Mary B.\] Coulston and
explain to her the circumstances.

With all love,  
VIVEKANANDA
