CHICAGO(?),  
*September, 1894*(*3*?),[1](#fn1)

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai),

Very kind of you to send up a man inquiring about my health and comfort.
But that's quite of a piece with your fatherly character. I am all right
here. Your kindness has left nothing more to be desired here. I hope
soon to see you in a few days. I don't require any conveyance while
going down. Descent is very bad, and the ascent is the worst part of the
job, that's the same in everything in the world. My heartful gratitude
to you.

Yours faithfully,  
VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#txt1)Diwanji never visited the U.S.A. The time and place given
    by his relatives are wrong obviously.
