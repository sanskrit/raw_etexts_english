## CXXIV

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod or Mrs. Ole Bull*

SESHNAG  
CHANDANBARI, KASHMIR  
\[EN ROUTE FROM SRINAGAR TO AMARNATH\]  
\[*End of July 1898*\]

I send back the old Dandi (A simple palanquin.) as it is difficult to
carry it through. I have got another like Margaret's. Please send it
back to the Tahsildar of Vernag, Khand Chand, Esq., whom you already
know. We are all right. Margot has discovered some new flowers and is
happy. There is not much ice so the road is good.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. Keep this Dandi till I come and pay the coolies (2) 4 Rs., 2 annas
each.

Coolie — Tara
