## SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTES TO *THE IMITATION OF CHRIST*

(*Prabuddha Bharata*, September 1982, pp. 390-93.)

In 1889, Swami Vivekananda translated into Bengali selections from Book
I, chapters 1-6 of Thomas à Kempis's *The Imitation of Christ*. They
were published along with a preface in a now-defunct Bengali monthly
magazine, *Sâhitya Kalpadruma.* The Swami's preface and Bengali
translation, entitled "Ishânusharana",[1](#fn1) were later published in
the Bengali *Complete Works* (first edition), VI, pp. 16-28. However,
only the preface to *The Imitation of Christ* was
[published](../../volume_8/writings_prose/a_preface.htm) in the English
edition of the *Complete Works, VIII.*

Swami Vivekananda's partial [Bengali](b6015_footnotes_imitation.pdf)
translation of *The Imitation of Christ* includes as footnotes
quotations from Hindu scriptures that parallel à Kempis's ideas,
comments or commentary. For the sake of clarity, these footnotes
(numbered 1 through 17) have been appended to their respective verses in
*The Imitation of Christ* (indicated in parentheses), arranged under
their appropriate chapter headings in the book, and reproduced here in
bold.

Many of the Sanskrit footnotes to the Bengali translation were later
rendered into English during the course of Swami Vivekananda's lecturing
or writing. For the sake of interest, these English translations have
also been added to the Swami's restored footnote text. Otherwise,
Sanskrit verses have been translated by the Publisher for the
convenience of the reader.

BOOK I[2](#fn2)

CHAPTER 1

*Of the Imitation of Christ and Contempt of all the Vanities of the
World*

1\. "He that followeth Me, walketh not in darkness", saith the Lord
\[John 8.12\]. (*The Imitation of Christ* V.1.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: BHAGAVAD-GITA 7.14

दैवी ह्येषा गुणमयी मम माया दुरत्यया।  
मामेव ये प्रपद्यन्ते मायामेतां तरन्ति ते॥

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S TRANSLATION: This My Mâyâ is divine, made up of
qualities and very difficult to cross. Yet those who come unto Me, cross
the river of life. (*Vide* ["Maya and
Freedom"](../../volume_2/jnana-yoga/maya_and_freedom.htm#v9_imitation) ,
*Complete Works*, II.)

2\. Let therefore our chief endeavour be to meditate upon the life of
Jesus Christ. (*The Imitation of Christ* V.1.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: *Adhyâtma Râmâyana*,

UTTARA-KANDA 5.54 (RAMAGITA)

ध्यात्वैवमात्मानमहर्निशं मुनि:।  
तिष्ठेत्सदा मुक्तसमस्तबन्धनः॥

PUBLISHER'S TRANSLATION: Thus meditating upon the Self day and night,
let the sage abide free from all bondage.

3\. The doctrine of Christ exceedeth all the doctrines of holy men; and
he that hath the Spirit will find therein the hidden manna. (*The
Imitation of Christ* V.2.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE:

When the Israelites were afflicted by want of food in a desert, God
showered on them a kind of "manna".

4\. But it falleth out, that many who often hear the Gospel of Christ,
are yet but little affected, because they are void of the Spirit of
Christ. But whosoever would fully and feelingly understand the words of
Christ, must endeavour to conform his life wholly to the life of Christ.
(*The Imitation of Christ* V.2.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE (A): BHAGAVAD-GITA 2.29

श्रुत्वाप्येनं वेद न चैव कश्चिन्

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S TRANSLATION: Others, hearing of It, do not
understand. (*Vide* ["The Gita
II"](../../volume_1/lectures_and_discourses/the_gita_ii.htm#v9_imitation)
, *Complete Works*, I.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE (B): *Vivekachudâmani* 62

न गच्छति विना पानं व्याधिरौषधशब्दतः।  
विनाऽपरोक्षानुभवं ब्रह्मशब्दैर्न मुच्यते॥

PUBLISHER'S TRANSLATION: A disease does not leave the body by simply
repeating the name of the medicine; one must take the medicine.
Similarly, liberation does not come by merely saying the word *Brahman*.
Brahman must be experienced.

  

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE (C): MAHABHARATA

(critical edition) 12.309.91

श्रुतेन किं येन न धर्ममाचरेत्।

PUBLISHER'S TRANSLATION: Of what avail is reading the Vedas without
practising religion?

5\. What will it avail thee to dispute profoundly of the Trinity if thou
be void of humility and art thereby displeasing to the Trinity? (*The
Imitation of Christ* V.3.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE:

According to the Christians, God the Father, Holy Ghost, and God the Son
are One in three and Three in One.

6\. Surely great words do not make a man holy and just; but a virtuous
life maketh him dear to God. (*The Imitation of Christ* V.3.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: *Vivekachudamani* 58

वाग्वैखरी शब्दझरी शास्त्रव्याख्यानकौशलम्।  
वैदुष्यं विदुषां तद्वद् भुक्तये न तु मुक्तये॥

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S TRANSLATION: Wonderful methods of joining words,
rhetorical powers, and explaining texts of the books in various ways —
these are only for the enjoyment of the learned, and not religion.
(*Vide*
["Realization"](../../volume_2/jnana-yoga/realisation.htm#v9_imitation)
, *Complete Works*, II.)

7\. If thou didst know the whole Bible by heart and the sayings of all
the philosophers, what would it profit thee without the love of God and
without grace? (*The Imitation of Christ* V.3.)

  

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: \[reference only\]

—I Corinthians 13.2.

8\. "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity" (Eccles.) except to love God and
to serve Him only. (*The Imitation of Christ* V.3.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: *Maniratnamâlâ*

के सन्ति सन्तोऽखिलवीतरागाः।  
अपास्तमोहाः शिवतत्त्वनिष्ठा:॥

PUBLISHER'S TRANSLATION: They alone are holy men (Sâdhus) who are devoid
of any longing for worldly objects, free from delusion and are devoted
to the truth of Shiva.

9\. Call often to mind that proverb "The eye is not satisfied with
seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing". (*The Imitation of Christ*
V.5.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: \[reference only\]

—Eccles. 1.8.

10\. Endeavour, therefore, to withdraw thy heart from the love of
visible things and to turn thyself to the invisible. For they that
follow their lusts stain their own consciences and lose the grace of
God. (*The Imitation of Christ* V.5.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: MAHABHARATA, 2.63

(YAYATIGATHA)

न जातु कामः कामानामुपभोगेन शाम्यति।  
हविषा कृष्णवर्त्मेव भूय एवाभिवर्धते॥

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S TRANSLATION: Desire is never satisfied by the
enjoyment of desires; it only increases the more, as fire when butter is
poured upon it. (*Vide* ["Maya and
Illusion"](../../volume_2/jnana-yoga/maya_and_illusion.htm#v9_imitation)
, *Complete Works*, II.)

CHAPTER 3

*Of the Doctrine of Truth*

11\. What availeth it to cavil and dispute much about dark and hidden
things; for ignorance of which we shall not be reproved at the day of
judgement? (*The Imitation of Christ* V.1.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE:

According to the Christian view, God will judge all beings on the last
day (the day of the dissolution of the world), and will award heaven or
hell according to the virtues or vices of different individuals.

12\. He to whom the Eternal Word speaketh is delivered from many an
opinion. (*The Imitation of Christ* V.2.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE:

This *Word* is somewhat similar to the Maya of the Vedantists. This
Itself was manifested in the form of Christ.

CHAPTER 5

*Of the Reading of Holy Scriptures*

13\. Truth, not eloquence, is to be sought for in Holy Scripture. Each
part of the Scripture is to be read with the same Spirit wherewith it
was written. (*The Imitation of Christ* V.1.)

  

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: KATHA UPANISHAD 1.2.9

नैषा तर्केण मतिरापनेया।

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S TRANSLATION: Neither is the mind to be disturbed by
vain arguments, for it is no more a question of argument; it is a
question of fact. (*Vide*
["Realization"](../../volume_2/jnana-yoga/realisation.htm#v9_imitation2)
, *Complete Works*, II.)

14\. Let not the authority of the writer offend thee, whether he be of
great or small learning; but let the love of pure truth draw thee to
read. (*The Imitation of Christ* V.1.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: Laws of Manu 2.238

आददीत शुभां विद्यां प्रयत्नादवरादपि।

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S TRANSLATION: Learn supreme knowledge with service
even from the man of low birth. (*Vide* ["The Common Bases of
Hinduism"](../../volume_3/lectures_from_colombo_to_almora/the_common_bases_of_hinduism.htm#v9_imitation)
, *Complete Works*, III.)

CHAPTER 6

*Of Inordinate Affections*

15\. Whensoever a man desireth anything inordinately, he becometh
presently disquieted in himself. (*The Imitation of Christ* V.1.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: BHAGAVAD-GITA 2.67

इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनुविधीयते।  
तदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि॥

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S TRANSLATION: For the mind which follows in the wake
of the wandering senses carries away his discrimination as a wind
(carries away from its course) a boat on the waters.

16\. The proud and covetous can never rest. The poor and humble in
spirit live together in all peace.

The man that is not yet perfectly dead to himself, is quickly tempted
and overcome in small and trifling things. (*The Imitation of Christ*
V.1.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: BHAGAVAD-GITA 2.62-63

ध्यायतो विषयान्पुंसः सङ्गस्तेषुपजायते।  
सङ्गात्सञ्जायते कामः कामात्क्रोधोऽभिजायते॥  
क्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोहः सम्मोहात्स्मृतिविभ्रमः।  
स्मृतिभ्रंशाद् बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति॥

PUBLISHER'S TRANSLATION: By thinking about sense objects, attachment to
them is formed. From attachment comes longing, and longing breeds anger.
From anger comes delusion, and from delusion, confused memory. From
confused memory comes the ruin of discrimination; and from the ruin of
discrimination, a man perishes.

17\. There is then no peace in the heart of a carnal man, nor in him
that is addicted to outward things, but in the spiritual and devout man.
(*The Imitation of Christ* V.2.)

SWAMI VIVEKANANDA'S FOOTNOTE: BHAGAVAD-GITA 2.60

यततो ह्यपि कौन्तेय पुरुषस्य विपश्चितः।  
इन्द्रियाणि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसभं मनः॥

PUBLISHER'S TRANSLATION: The turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, violently
carry away the mind of even a wise man striving after perfection.
