title = "The roots of Vaiṣṇavam: a view from the numerology of Vedic texts"

+++
While glorified with a 1000 names in the famous stotra of the early
Sātvata tradition of the Mahābharata, in the texts of an even earlier
period the god primarily went under that name Viṣṇu. Indeed, even the
litany of the 1000 names begins with viśvaṃ viśṇur vaśatkāraḥ signaling
the connection to that ancient layer of tradition, with viśvam i.e,
“everything” being an etymological elaboration of his name Viṣṇu, “the
all-pervader”. Further, vaṣaṭkāra indicates his link to the Vedic ritual
(the vaṣaṭ offering to Viṣṇu is already specifically mentioned twice in
the Ṛgveda) wherein we can trace the meteoric rise of this god as the
head-deity of one of the great sectarian streams of the āstika-s.

His later rise notwithstanding, it should be borne in mind that Viṣṇu is
a prominent deity of early Indo-European vintage. Mentioned 113 times in
Ṛgveda itself (Table 1), one can already sense his prominence in the
pantheon. His cognate in the Germanic world Víðarr provides evidence of
his importance in the early undivided IE days. In the Gylfaginning of
the Icelandic prose Edda, Snorri Sturluson, who still had links to the
old Germanic heathenism, described Víðarr thus:  
*“Víðarr is the name of the silent asa. He has a very thick shoe, and he
is the strongest next after Thor. From him the gods have much help in
all hard tasks.”*  
Here, his being “strongest next to Thor” is mirrored in the ārya
tradition where Viṣṇu is nearly equal/equal to his elder brother/friend
Indra. Víðarr “helped the gods in the hard tasks”, a specific feature
shared with Viṣṇu in the ārya tradition. Finally, his thick shoe is
related to the stride Víðarr takes in the final battle of the gods,
Ragnarok, where he tramples the nether jaw of the demonic Fenris-wolf
and opens its mouth wide apart to slay it. In the ārya tradition,
likewise Viṣṇu’s three demon-conquering wide strides are well-known and
this gives him his alternative name in the Veda, Urugāya, “the
wide-goer”. This is related to again related to the etymology of
Víðarr = “wider” and the very cognate of Víðarr, vitara, appears in
the śruti in the context of Viṣṇu: athābravīd vṛtram indro haniṣyan
sakhe viṣṇo vitaraṃ vi kramasva || : Then Indra spoke as he prepared to
slay Vṛtra: “friend Viṣṇu stride widely.” The strides of Viṣṇu are also
said to make space by widening the universe for Indra to swing his vajra
to slay Vṛtra. This is parallel to Víðarr holding the jaws of the
Fenris-wolf wide apart.

Both Viṣṇu and Víðarr are mentioned as possessing a special world/realm.
In the case of Viṣṇu, who is called the “cowherd” or the
cattle-protector, it is wide pasture in a mountainous realm. Víðarr’s is
a case it is mentioned a thick with grass. Finally, we may note that
Víðarr is one of the deities to survive the Ragnarok and usher in the
new Germanic “satyayuga”. Among the ārya-s, as the “time-god”, he is
seen as again surviving the yuga-s in the later Viṣṇu-centric
traditions.

1. Viṣṇu (an image of seal impression of seal from Gandhāra;
Northwestern India showing a Hunnic or Iranic lord worshiping the god)
and Celtic Taranis (an ancient Gaulish bronze found in 1774 CE at Le
Chatelet, France)*

In the Celtic world, the chief Gaulish deity of the Indra-class,
Taranis, appears to have absorbed elements of his partner, the deity of
the Viṣṇu-class. We go somewhat out on a limb to suggest that the late
iconography of Taranis, before the end of the Gaulish religion, was
actually influenced by that of Viṣṇu carried either directly by Indian
or Indianized Iranic travelers to the West or from them via
intermediaries to the Gauls (Figure 1). Examples of this influence are
seen in the wheel-wielding images of Taranis and his depiction on the
famous Gundestrup cauldron. In the case of the latter, the Indian
influence is clinched by the elephants associated with the goddess
(probably Rhiannon) who is depicted similar to Lakṣmī the wife of Viṣṇu.
We postulate that this influence was because they could see obvious
parallels between their deities and the Indian counterparts, which in
turn was a consequence of Taranis absorbing elements of the original
Viṣṇu-class deity.

Closer to the Indo-Aryan realm, our Iranic cousins have deity called
Rashnu Razishta, the heavenly judge, who superficially plays a
Citragupta-like role. His name and sudden appearance without parallels
elsewhere in the IE world suggests that he is none other than a cognate
of the Indo-Aryan Viṣṇu. His name probably underwent a folk-linguistic
mutation from ‘vi’ to ‘ra’ for the Iranians probably (wrongly)
interpreted the ‘vi’ as a prefix with a negative connotation and
“corrected” it to ‘ra’ the proper one (A suggestion also made by
Puhvel/Dumezil though, in my opinion wrongly, opposed by some
Indo-Europeanists). His popular worship among the Iranians is hinted by
the occurrence of his name as part of personal names found in the
Persepolis Fortification Tablets from the time of the Achaemenid emperor
Darius-I: Rashnudāta and Rashnuka and the Parthian name Rashnumithra.
Rashnu’s link to Viṣṇu is indicated by his accompanying Mithra to his
right on his chariot when he rides forth for battle. In the Zoroastrian
strain of the Iranic religion, Mithra with his vazra has taken the place
of Indra and Rashnu retains the role of Viṣṇu now as Mithra’s assistant
instead (Note that even RV Viṣṇu is specifically linked to Mitra, e.g.
in RV 1.156.1 and RV 8.52.3). Notably, Yasht 12 to Rashnu (which has
been clearly redacted to interpolate Ahura Mazdā’s name for Rashnu in
the initial manthra-s) shows that he held an important role in the
ritual and he is described as tall, forceful deity praised in
superlative terms indicating the importance he once held in Iranian
realm:

rashnvô ashâum rashnvô razishta rashnvô spênishta rashnvô vaêdhishta
rashnvô vidhcôishta rashnvô parakavistema rashnvô dûraêdareshtema
rashnvô arethamat bairishta rashnvô tâyûm nijakhnishta…

O holy Rashnu\! O most-true Rashnu\! most-beneficent Rashnu\!
most-knowing Rashnu\! most- discerning Rashnu\! most-fore-knowing
Rashnu\! most far-seeing Rashnu\! Rashnu, the best doer of justice\!
Rashnu, the best smiter of thieves (tâyu = Skt stāyu)…

Keeping with his far-seeing nature, the yasht is unusual in describing
the Iranic karshvare-s (world regions) and heavenly constellations as
the regions seen by Rashnu as he flies along. This peculiar feature of
the yasht, seen with no other Iranic deity, points to two parallels with
Viṣṇu: (1) The listing of the realms is suggestive of Viṣṇu pervading
them or striding over them. (2) Among the places Rashnu is invoked there
are 3 stations mentioned in succession the quarters of the earth,
boundary of the earth and all over the earth. Apart from reminding one
of the three strides, it also reminds one of the ṛk where Viṣṇu is
described as fixing the boundary of the earth by the pegs at the
quarters (RV 7.100.3).

In conclusion, we see that the Viṣṇu-class of deities, despite their
spotty occurrence in what has come down to us of the IE traditions, can
be traced to a prominent proto-deity in the early IE religion. Here, by
early we mean at least the time when the western thrust of the IE people
from their Yamnaya homeland took place — the group from which the
Germanic, Celtic and Indo-Iranian branches ultimately derive. This
conclusion is of importance in understanding the rise of Viṣṇu in the
Indian tradition. We shall explore the early stages of that by looking
at the counts of the occurrence of the name Viṣṇu in several Vedic texts
(Table 1). These texts span the entire range of Vedic tradition from the
earliest RV to the Ṛgvidhāna which clings to the very edge of the late
Vedic literary activity. In between lie the Saṃhitā-s of the 3 other
Veda-s, the khila of the RV, the Brāhmaṇa-s, the Śrauta-sūtra-s and the
Gṛhya-sūtra-s. Across these texts the most common name of the deity
under consideration is Viṣṇu. He is known by other names like Urugāya,
Śipiviṣṭa and the epithet evaya in the core Vedic period. In the latest
Vedic texts we encounter the name Nārāyaṇa (e.g. Taittirīya-āraṇyaka),
which became prominent in the epic period. However, all these names are
generally rare making the count for Viṣṇu a good proxy for estimating
the extent of his mentions.

First, let us get some caveats regarding this table out of the way.
These texts are of very different sizes; thus, someone could claim that
the counts could simply reflect the size differences. Hence, one would
wish to normalize it by text size. But what unit do you use for
normalization? The word would be the ideal unit but it is difficult to
obtain for all these texts because of samasta-pada-s typical of Sanskrit
not being separated in each case. An alternative is the size of the file
in bits. However, this depends on the encoding/format used and we do not
have all the texts in a common encoding/format. Next, we have ascii or
utf-8/16 encoding files for many of them but not all. The rest were
counted using the html files on the TITUS system. We cannot be sure of
the completeness of all the texts in TITUS. This said, we can still use
the absolute counts reasonable well by comparing “apples with apples”.
The Saṃhitā-s may be approximately seen to be of the same order of
magnitude. The Brāhmaṇa can be again approximately compared, and the
equivalent classes of kalpa texts can be similarly compared.

With these caveats in place, one thing that stands out is the
extraordinary prominence of Viṣṇu in the Vedic tradition represented by
the Yajurveda. This is clearly in contrast with the other Vedic
tradition, namely that of the Samaveda. Tellingly, the one Samavedic
text that is enriched in Viṣṇu is the Mantra-brāhmaṇa, which is
primarily a collection of yajuṣ-es within the Samavedic tradition. This
short collection of yajuṣ-es has the same order of magnitude of mentions
of Viṣṇu as the SV Kauthuma-saṃhitā and Pañcaviṃśa-brāhmaṇa, both of
which are several times the size of the Mantra-brāhmaṇa.

The divisions in the Vedic tradition correspond to the roles of the
ritualists: the hautra tradition of the RV practitioners, the ādhvaryava
tradition of the YV practitioners and the chāndoga tradition of the SV
practitioners. The AV practitioners are associated with the role of the
Brahman but in reality have their own parallel śrauta tradition. We see
that in the ādhvaryava tradition the prominence of Viṣṇu is across the
three sections, i.e. the Saṃhitā, the Brāhmaṇa and Śrauta-sūtra-s that
roughly corresponding to temporal layers within the tradition. Further,
in the hautra tradition, the Śrauta-sūtra-s have more mentions of Viṣṇu
than their Brāhmaṇa-s, which are larger than the sūtra-s in size. Again,
notably, with one exception (we will come to that in the end) the
Gṛhya-sūtra-s have relatively low occurrences of Viṣṇu across the
board relative to the corresponding Śrauta-sūtra-s.

Now, in the śrauta practice the adhvaryu plays the most important role
in terms of the physical actions of the ritual (of course accompanied by
yajuṣ incantations). He also issues calls to the hotṛ and udgātṛ to play
their parts. The hotṛ in contrast primarily plays the role of reciting
the Sāmidhenī-s and the śastra-s and the like, while the udgātṛ’s main
role is the singing of the stotra-s during the Soma ritual. While the YV
and SV texts as we *have them today* clearly postdate and presuppose the
core RV, we know from the internal evidence of the RV that there were
already YV and SV practitioners alongside the composers of the RV. E.g.:
udgāteva śakune sāma gāyasi : You O bird sing a sāman like the udgātṛ.
tvam adhvaryur uta hotāsi pūrvyaḥ praśāstā potā januṣā purohitaḥ | : You
(Agni) are the adhvaryu, the primal hotṛ, the praśastṛ (an assistant of
the hotṛ who is also known as the upavaktṛ or the maitrāvaruṇa who plays
a special role in recitations to those two gods), the potṛ (the
assistant of the Brahman who specializes in prāyaścitta-s) and from
birth the purohita. Further, the parallel in the Zoroastrian tradition
suggest that at least the hotṛ, the adhvaryu and some version of the
brahman go back to the proto-Indo-Iranian period.

While these ṛtvik-s function in unison in the śrauta rituals their
mantra collections and activities suggest that they originally
represented alternative ritual traditions within the early Indo-European
fold, which were brought together under a single framework by at least
the proto-Indo-Iranian period. While under a common framework they
clearly maintained their own parallel traditions, techniques of
composition and ritual principles. When we take this in to account,
along with the evidence for the presence of a prominent Viṣṇu-class
deity in the early Indo-European religion, we can account for the
development of Vaiṣṇava tendencies in the Veda: we posit that it was not
that Viṣṇu rose to prominence in the middle Vedic period (as opposed to
the early Vedic core RV with the Aindrāgna and old Āditya dominance)
from nothing but was always a special deity in the ādhvaryava tradition
of the Indo-Aryans. What happened was the rise to dominance of the
ādhvaryava tradition in the Indo-Aryan śrauta ritual. Conversely, it is
conceivable that on the Iranian side the hautraka tradition dominated,
at least in early Zoroastrianism where Zarathustra calls himself the
cognate zaotar.

These observations can be summed up by one statement in the ādhvaryava
tradition: yajño vai viṣṇuḥ |: The ritual is verily Viṣṇu. Thus, by
identifying Viṣṇu with the ritual he is identified with the core
activities of the ādhvaryava tradition. Hence, this is consistent with
this frequent mention within this tradition. This proposal is further
strengthened by the two special devatā-dvandva-s that are common though
not unique to the YV tradition but not found in the RV Saṃhitā, which is
otherwise rich in devatā-dvandva-s. The main dvandva featuring Viṣṇu in
the RV is Indrāviṣṇū, where he is linked to his usual partner Indra. The
devatā-dvandva Agnāviṣṇū, found in the AV, RV-brāhmaṇa and frequently in
the YV tradition, marks the special position of Viṣṇu not only as the
last of the deities to receive the sacrifice but also tacitly or not so
tacitly indicates his supremacy by placing him at the end of the
pantheon (Aitaryeya-brāhmaṇa: agnir vai devānām avamo viṣṇuḥ paramas
tadantareṇa sarvā anyā devatā | : Agni is the lowest of the gods, Viṣṇu
is the foremost, all the other deities lie in between. While primarily
positional it also hints the primacy of Viṣṇu). The second is the
dvandva Viṣṇū-varuṇā seen, for example, in the Taittirīya and the
Aitaryeya-brāhmaṇa traditions. This dvandva has a special role that is
typical of the ādhvaryava tradition, proper completion of yajña, the
invocation of Viṣṇu protects from the badly done yajña while the
invocation of Varuṇa protects the well-done one and between the two all
is taken care off viṣṇur vai yajṅasya duriṣṭam pāti varuṇaḥ sviṣṭaṃ |
tayor ubhayor eva śāntyai ||).

Thus, the unusual situation of dvandva-s not found in the RV but shared
by the RV brāhmaṇa-s and YV tradition, and the prominence of Viṣṇu in
the “little YV” within the SV, i.e., the Mantra-brāhmaṇa, suggests that
these are late entrants into the SV and RV tradition from the YV
tradition. Indeed, the even greater prominence of Viṣṇu in the RV
Śrauta-sūtra-s as opposed to the Brāhmaṇa-s again indicates the
ādhvaryava dominance now entering the hautra territory. Thus, it
suggests that the rise of Viṣṇu was essential a feature of adhvaryava
dominance in the śrauta ritual. This in contrast to the protogonic
Prajāpati, who while emerging late from the para-Vedic periphery,
uniformly affected all the Vedic traditions. The Prājāpatya-s competed
with Viṣṇu for the two figures of the primordial turtle Kaśyapa and the
primordial boar Varāha. While the former was originally associated with
Indra (from the RV itself), the latter is hinted to be associated with
Viṣṇu in the early AV tradition recorded in the Paippalāda-saṃhitā.
However, the Prājāpatya-s laid a strong claim to both before Viṣṇu
eventually won and claimed both the figures as his avatāra-s in the
Post-Vedic period.

Finally, we saw that the Gṛhya-sūtra-s have a low frequency of mention
of Viṣṇu with the exception being that of the Taittirīya-affiliated
Vaikhānasa tradition. The Gṛhya-sūtra-s for most part generally record
an archaic core of household rites of passage quite different from the
śrauta rituals. Thus, the absence of a special role of Viṣṇu beyond
specific contexts like the fertility ritual for preparing the womb for
the embryo is not unexpected. Now, one of the two earliest sectarian
Vaiṣṇava traditions arose among the Vaikhānasa-s. Thus, what we are
seeing in the case of the Vaikhānasa-gṛhyasūtra is the emergence of this
tradition which went on to become a still extant system of the combined
iconic and fire worship of Viṣṇu. The second sectarian tradition
centered on Viṣṇu, the Pañcarātra, explicitly identifies itself with the
Śukla-yajurveda. Thus, we may say that rise of Vaiṣṇavam itself is an
internal development within the ādhvaryava tradition, with the two early
schools emerging from each of the main Yajurvedic divisions. Once these
had emerged they influenced the latest of the Vedic text across the
traditions. We see this in the case of the Ṛgvidhāna, which for a
relatively short text has several mentions of Viṣṇu in the context of
what appears to be an early Pāñcarātrika section.

To conclude we may ask what about the Sātvata tradition that affiliates
itself to the Pāñcarātrika tradition? We have evidence that Viṣṇu’s
primary manifestation in that system the Vāsudeva along with the 3 other
vyūha deities and the goddess Ekānaṃśā probably have para-Vedic roots in
the Indo-Iranian borderlands. Likewise, with the watery Nārāyaṇa or his
humanized dyadic form of Nara-Nārāyaṇa. But these traditions always saw
itself as a part of Vaiṣṇava system. Hence, we posit that they are part
of greater “Vaiṣṇava” tradition of old IE provenance that in addition to
influencing the ādhvaryava tradition also had “lower” para-Vedic
registers such as these. Nevertheless, this tradition’s links to the old
Viṣṇu are hinted by certain specific features, for example: (1) The
Vāsudeva in his human manifestation (Kṛṣṇa Devakīputra) consorts with a
large number of women. Viṣṇu consorting with a bevy of goddesses is
already mentioned in RV 3.54.14. This also relates to his early
fertility role as the protector of the sperm of males. (2) Already in
the RV Viṣṇu is repeatedly mentioned as being the cowherd or the
cow-protector (RV 1.22.18; RV 3.55.10). Thus, this aspect of the
Devakīputra of the Sātvata religion are likely merely a humanization of
an old trait of the deity.
