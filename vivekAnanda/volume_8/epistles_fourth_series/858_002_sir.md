(*Translated from [Bengali](b6007e8002.pdf)* )

BARANAGORE,  
*22nd February, 1889*.

DEAR SIR, (Shri Pramadadas Mitra)

I had intended to go to Varanasi, and I planned to reach there after
visiting the birthplace of my Master. But unluckily on the way to that
village I had an attack of high fever followed by vomiting and purging
as in cholera. There was again fever after three or four days — and as
the body is now so weak that I can barely walk even two steps, I have
been compelled now to give up my previous intention. I do not know what
is God's will, but my body is quite unfit for treading on this path.
Anyway, the body is not everything. Recovering my health after a few
days here, I entertain the hope of visiting you there. The will of
Vishweshwara, the Lord of the universe, will prevail — whatever that may
be. You also kindly bless me. My respects to you and brother
Jnanananda. 

Your servant,

VIVEKANANDA.
