title = "Some sound changes inxa0IA"

+++
Some neo-Indo-Aryan languages sound unusual to us because they are not
our native tongue and very “discordant” with respect to saMskR^ita.
Hence, those “funny” words sort of make us sit up and try to figure out
their evolutionary paths. Today we were amused by some reminiscences of
usages in marAThi that was spoken in the land of our youth. This led us
to some peculiarities in sound changes as this branch of Indo-Aryan,
which probably included marAThI, gujarAtI and ko\~NkaNI diverged from
its ancestor.

|                 |             |              |             |
| :-------------: | :---------: | :----------: | :---------: |
|  **Sanskrit**   | **Marathi** | **Gujarati** | **meaning** |
|     *ikShu*     |     Us      |      Us      |  sugarcane  |
| *upalakShayati* |   oLakhne   | oLakhvu\~.n  |  recognize  |
|    *kShaNa*     |     saN     |     khaN     |  festival   |

Thus even as marAThi and gujarAti-s ancestors broke off from the more
northern radiations there was an unusual kSh\>s transition, with his
change apparently happening to a greater degree to the South i.e. in
marAThi.  
Now a semantic question why does saMskR^ita kShaNa give rise to saN/khan
which means a festival while the former means a moment or instant.
Apparently there are rare instances (even the notorious MW dictionary
lists some) where kShaNa is used for a festival in saMskR^ita. Given
that festivals were marked by the instant or moment of the moon entering
a certain nakShatra or attaining a certain tithi or the holy muhUrta, it
appears that word kShaNa in a calendrical sense became equated with
festival in this southern Indo-Aryan branch.
