## CXCIX

*To Mr. Okakura Kakuzo*

THE MATH, BELUR  
HOWRAH DIS.  
BENGAL, INDIA

*18th June 1901*

DEAR FRIEND —

Allow me to call you a friend. We must have been such in some past
birth. Your cheque for 300 rupees duly reached and many thanks for the
same.

I am just thinking of going to Japan, but with one thing or another and
my precarious health, I cannot expedite matters as I wish.

Japan to me is a dream — so beautiful that it haunts one all his life.

With all love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA

Kakudzo \[Kakuzo\] Okakura Esq.

Tokyo, Japan
