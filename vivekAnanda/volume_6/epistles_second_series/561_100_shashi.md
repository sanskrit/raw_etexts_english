63 ST. GEORGE'S ROAD, LONDON S.W.,  
*24th June, 1896*.

DEAR SHASHI,

Max Müller wants all the sayings of Shri Ramakrishna classified, that
is, all on Karma in one place, on Vairagya in another place, so on
Bhakti, Jnana, etc., etc. You must undertake to do this forthwith. ...
We must take care to present only the universal aspect of his teachings.
. . .

Sharat starts for America tomorrow. The work here is coming to a head.
We have already got funds to start a London Centre. Next month I go to
Switzerland to pass a month or two there, then I shall return to London.
What will be the good of my going home? — This London is the hub of the
world. The heart of India is here. How can I leave without laying a sure
foundation here? Nonsense! For the present, I shall have Kali here, tell
him to be ready. ...

We want great spirit, tremendous energy, and boundless enthusiasm, no
womanishness will do. Try to go on exactly as I wrote to you in my last.
We want organisation. Organisation is power, and the secret of this is
obedience.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
