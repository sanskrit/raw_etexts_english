## CXXXI

*To Sister Nivedita*

\[*Early 1899?*\]

MY DEAR NIVEDITA,

The address of my cousin is 127 Manicktala Street. The husband's name is
Durga Prasanna Bose. The wife's name is most probably not known to the
people you will meet in the male department. Therefore it is the custom
to ask for the wife of so-and-so.

Manicktala Street is that which runs east and west, south of the tank
garden.

Yours with love,  
VIVEKANANDA
