Somakhya’s mother (SM) and Lootika’s mother (LM) ran into each other
during their visit to the shrine of Rudra beside the river on a Monday
evening. They sat at the platform below the vast aśvattha tree beside
the subsidiary Viṣṇu shrine to chat for some time.

LM: “How is it going with all the quiet at your place now that Somakhya
has left?”  
SM: “Well, I’ve returned to teaching the Mahābhārata and have been
contemplating on the features of early Indo-Aryan. By the way I saw your
brilliant daughter last evening at the clothes shop.”  
LM: “Ah\! You mean Vrishchika; have been worrying about her.”  
SM: “Why? I heard that she has been invited to give a talk at some
famous human genomics meeting regarding the paper she has just
published. She seems to be following her stellar elder sister with this
paper while just in the fourth year of med-school.”  
LM: “That’s exactly the matter of worry. The conference is at
Kṣayadrājanagara, a big bad city, where I am sure you heard that just
a week ago there was a major attack at the train station by the
marupiśāca-s in which several were killed. Vrishchika has set her mind
on going and you know when that happens there’s no easy way to change
it.”

SM: “You should let her go. After it will bring her yaśas. It would seem
she is on course to out doing even Lootika. Moreover, you let Lootika go
on multiple trips, which included that really scary day of the Uniform
Civil Code riots. You also let Varoli go to the dreadful Visphotaka,
which is an even worse city than Kshayadrajanagara.”  
LM: “O dear, you over-estimate Vrishchika. Knowing my daughters well I
can say that that Lootika is to the rest of them like Maghavan among the
gods. Thus, even on that day, while I feared for her greatly, I knew
deep within she’ll be back home: lūtikā bahuyutikā vā.”  
SM: “But some day Vrishchika will be on her own. You can’t just keep her
protected at home and unexposed to the big world. My brother lives in
Kshayadrajanagara. I could give you his number. May be his daughter
Saumanasa or son Mandara could pick Vrishchika up at the station and
make sure she’s alright.”

LM: “That’s very kind of you. I will certainly take their number, it
will be useful in more than one way. However, I understand that
Somakhya’s friend, that kid Indrasena, who is her co-author and
co-speaker in that conference, also lives there. I know she has gotten
very pally with him and he would pick her up at the station. But at the
same time I fear the two of them might be up to some mischief.
Vrishchika let it slip that after their talk they were going to skip
part of the meeting to go roaming in the city and make an excursion to
Devaparvata.”  
SM: “Ah, if Indrasena is there I’m sure he’ll ensure she’s OK. As for
the mischief, I could give you his parents’ number. Call them and
express your concerns; they would make sure that the two don’t do
something too extravagant. But Vrishchika has to find her way in life:
educate her but let her have her fun within limits. Let her meet my
niece Saumanasa too: I am sure Saumanasa would benefit a lot from advice
from Vrishchika.”

Just then they saw a mongoose scampering away into overgrowth adjacent
to the northern wall of the temple. It paused for while giving them a
good “darśana” and then vanished. LM : “That looks almost like an
adbhuta to me. What might it mean?”  
SM: “Well, since you saw it first possibly you are going to be favored
by the mighty Kāmeśvara.”  
LM : “Hope both of us are…”

Vrishchika’s father had boarded her onto the train to Kshayadrajanagara,
which soon got moving. Vrishchika felt tremendous happiness as the train
started coursing on its way towards its destination – for the first time
she was travelling alone, unlike her sister Lootika, and sensed that she
had become an adult. She also felt nice to be in solitude – she
remembered Lootika’s words on the importance of solitude: “When you have
to spend all your time in close contact with mundane people you start
thinking like them and soon lose your ability to see the parokṣa by
which that which mystifies or even kills them can be apprehended. Hence,
it is useful to have some time off in silent contemplation.” After a
while she started preparing for her presentation. Here again she
followed her sister’s method of carefully preparing her talk: laying out
the time for each slide, planning what she was going say and when, and
anticipate various questions and keep answers for them ready. At that
point she wondered how their friend Somakhya had this uncanny knack of
giving rather disparate talks back to back without preparing at all. She
thought to herself: “Perhaps, that is tattvāveśa”. But then Lootika’s
words came back to her that a good experimentalist must be methodical
and well-planned in their approach to anything.

After a while, even as she was preparing to sleep, a woman passed by
Vrishchika to her seat and as she did so dropped notes amounting to a
few thousand rūpaka-s and her passport on the floor. Vrishchika called
out to her and but she had her ears plugged with a headset and walked on
oblivious of her lost property. Vrishchika gingerly gathered the stuff
and walked up and gave it to her. She was very happy and gave Vrishchika
a note as a reward. Vrishchika smiled saying that she did not need it
as: “Dhaneśvara keeps me well\!” The woman responded: “whoever that
Dhaneśvara is may he continue to be good to you”, even as Vrishchika
walked back to her seat.

◊◊◊◊◊

Indrasena and Vrishchika were rather disappointed that the former’s
parents had poured water on their plan of roaming through certain parts
of the city that night after the meeting was over. As they were dropping
them off at the conference center they said: “Indra, if it were just you
we would not even ask where you have been. But we have promised this
charming young lady’s parents to keep her out of all trouble. While we
have some confidence in your fighting skills, and even if you were to
take your pistol with you, it is a wholly different matter of defending
oneself and defending a young lady by your side. You know well that
mahāmada’s prowlers and other assorted dasyu-s are constantly looking
out for girls in places you want to go to.” Instead, they proposed that
would pick them up at the conference center and bring them home for
dinner.

As they were walking in Indrasena said somewhat sharply: “Gautamī, you
should have been more careful with keeping secrets. If you want to have
adventure you cannot announce everything to your parents.”  
Vrishchika simpered and said: “I know. I just accidentally let it slip
under pointed interrogation. But after all we might get to talk about
the rahasya-s that I have been long wanting to know more about.”  
Indrasena: “OK. Indeed, there are many exciting rahasya-s to talk about
but remember that with such rahasya-s it is even more imperative to shut
ones trap with the general public.”  
Vrishchika: “I know, I know. I can be quite a Kunti when it comes to
such matters but you know how it is when you are interrogated.”

Later that evening Indrasena’s parents picked them up and took them home
for dinner. After dinner Indrasena took Vrishchika to his room. He
offered Vrishchika a cushion as a seat and as she looked around his room
for the first time taking in the sights she felt a strange sense of déjà
vu. She saw a large painting of Naravāhana on the wall with his three
wives Śriyā, Ṛddhi and Bhadrā hugging him and his son Nalakūbara seated
beside him. The mantra “namo dhanadāya ca dhanasvāmine ca ||” was
inscribed around the painting. Below it hung a Japanese painting with
several figures of which she could only recognize one as being a yakṣa.
Below that on a separate stool was a well-bound copy of the bṛhatkathā.

Vrishchika: “O ātreya, I see them all, the signs of Yakṣarāṭ everywhere.
This is the indeed the sign of knower of rahasya-s. Who else today can
even contemplate being on the path of Naravāhana-datta the son of
Udayana. How was that most powerful path revealed to you? Most only
sadly wish for it as losers do.”  
Indrasena: “O Gautamī it is a long story but short of it goes thus. In
my childhood as I was learning the Taittirīya-śruti I had dreams on many
continuous nights of the great peak of Kailasa-parvata. Above it I saw
hovering a great airplane, the Puṣpaka. By myself I began uttering the
mantra-s starting with tirodhā-bhūḥ svāhā| Other mysterious mantra-s of
Vaiśravaṇa started coming to my mind as the old Hindus would say as if
from a past birth. But they were incomplete and I had wait till I could
apprehend most of them due to the teachings of the vañga-siṃha.”

Vrishchika: “Who is this teacher – is it not remarkable that he obtained
the Kauberī vidyā that lies concealed?”  
Indrasena: “My father has a friend. He was known as the vaṅga-siṃho
rājarāja-mata kaṇṭhīravaḥ: a vipra who was a lion among the vaṅga-s. He
could be truly described as ‘dhanaṃ meru-tulyam’ and possessed of many
kinds of vidyā-s. People looked at him and wondered ‘how could he be
endowed with all of this wealth, health, beauty, intelligence, wife and
children? He never seemed to age\!’ After all it is almost a truism
that: “indreṇa sarvāni śubhāny ekasmin puruṣe saṃyuktaṃ na sthāpitāni |’
Seeing him people got the hint that after all the advaitin-s were simply
being losers when they asked ‘tataḥ kim?’ when confronted with dhanaṃ
meru-tulyam| As though guided by Rājarāja, with youthful impropriety, I
once jousted with him on a scientific topic very familiar to the two of
us, as also your agrajā and Somakhya of quick discernment. I will tell
you about that at a different point in time. While he did not openly
admit it, despite being a widely acknowledged professor, he felt he had
been defeated by a mere youth like me in that debate. It was then that
it slipped out of his mouth: ‘Perhaps, this why the ācārya had said the
totality of Dhanada-siddhi is not on me. It must be due to the mantra of
the Bhṛgu-s I don’t have.’ I queried him on the Dhaneśvara-siddhi and he
agreed to help me apprehend the Kaubera-śāsana whose mantra-s had
briefly flashed before me saying if one mastered it ‘he becomes
Naravāhanadatta.”

Vrishchika: “Most interesting, I see signs of a genuine Jambhala-vidvān
in you. Indeed, why talk about the imaginary ‘eko brahmaṇa ānandaḥ’ when
you cannot achieve ‘eko mānuṣa ānandaḥ’ in this world. It is more like
wishful thinking coming from not applying oneself vigorously to the path
of Dhaneśvara. But since there is no gain without pain I have long
suspected that this path must have be arduous. What is the significance
of that Nipponic painting below that of the Rājarāja-parivāra? It
reminds me of the incident I have told you from childhood when I
captured as a khārkhoḍa the bhūta of a prācya from those regions.”  
Indrasena: “Ah that one is important to me as a reminder that, even
though arduous, one who applies himself to the Vitteśa-siddhānta can be
like a Naravāhanadatta even if he might be from the far-off land of the
pītavarṇa-s”  
Vrishchika: “How did you get it? Who are those figures depicted in
it?”  
Indrasena: “My father obtained it when visiting the prācya-s on matters
relating to his work. He managed to with some difficulty befriend the
phlegmatic prācya “deśika’’ of the temple on mount Shigi who eventually
gave him this painting on mulberry paper. The figure you see to the left
is a Nipponic mantra-vādin known as Myoren with immense Kaubera-siddhi.
The figure to the right is Daigo the emperor of Japan. He was afflicted
by an incurable disease. Myoren performed a Vitteśa-sādhanā and as
result a guhyaka appeared – he is the central figure with the sword –
the yakṣa then cured the emperor.”  
Vrishchika: “Remarkable\!”  
Indrasena then walked up to the painting and turned it around: “Here on
the back you can see the images of the great Vaiśravaṇa along with his
wife Śriyā and son Nalakūbara. This a painting of their idols installed
on Mt Shigi.”

Vrishchika: “O Atri, that painting of a sword with the siddham script
also seems to be Nipponic. It too seems to be connected with śrī
Naravāhana. It looks like the sword of a vidyādhara upon attaining
siddhi. Could you please tell me more about it?”  
Indrasena: “Gautamī that is the painting of the sword received by
Sakanoue no Tamuramaro from Yakṣarāṭ before going to war with the Ainus.
There is a long back-story here. It is said that when Xuanzong, the Tang
emperor of the cīna-s, was in deep fear of his enemies he was aided by
Vaiśravaṇa and Nalakūbara due to their mantra-s deployed by Amoghavajra.
A little later when the Silla Koreans backed by the cīna-s threatened
the Nipponians the latter similarly invoked Vaiśravaṇa through an
elaborate ritual that gave them total immunity from those mainland
cousins of theirs. At that time a Nipponic mantravādin had a dream
wherein a horse with a jeweled saddle led him to a holy site,
Kuramadera, to the north of Kyoto, where he found a svāyambhuva idol of
Kubera and installed it in a great temple there. Thereafter in the late
700s of the Common Era, the warrior Sakanoue no Tamuramaro worshiped
Dhanada at that temple, attained siddhi much like our Naravāhanadatta,
and obtained a sword from the god. He used this sword in his campaign
against the Ainus and conquered their land. There he built a copy of the
temple at Kuramadera depicting Yakṣarāṭ as being borne by guhyaka-s
known as nara-s exactly as prescribed in our tradition.”  
Vrishchika: “Thank you for the most interesting narrative. What is
written in the siddham script on that painting?”  
Indrasena: “It is the mantra Sakanoue used: oṃ vaiśravaṇa sahaparivāreṇa
samāja jaḥ huṃ vaṃ hoḥ oṃ ve svāhā ||”

Vrishchika: “Indra, I have so many things to talk to you about. But
since time is short right now I would like to ask you regarding the
Puṣpaka-vimāna yantra which is mentioned in the śruti of the
Taittirīyaka-s as being engineered by the god Tvaṣṭṛ for Kubera. Could
you please give me a darśana of the Puṣpaka-vimāna-yantra you worship
and lead me to the Puṣpaka-vimāna-sādhanā?”  
Indrasena: “Alinī. That’s a rahasya-prayoga. You would need to engage in
much Kaubera-yogābhyāsa for any degree of success in that direction.
Nevertheless let me show the Puṣpaka to you.” Indrasena led her to a
closet in his room and opened the door to reveal the image of the vimāna
in the center of which were the seated images of Rājarāja, Ṛddhi and
Nalakūbara. His antardhānāstra was placed in front of him. In front of
the vimāna was the image of yakṣa Maṅkanaka the gatekeeper of Kubera.
There was also an image of the cow Sarvakāmadughā. There was a pot of
the five-metal alloy with water and a glass pot with honey in it on the
vimāna-pratimā. Indrasena: “Alinikā utter the following mantra-s after
me gazing single-mindedly at the Puṣpaka-vimāna:  
oṃ haṃ jambhalāya vaiśravaṇāya maṇibhadrāya pāṅcikāya pūrṇabhadrāya
nalakūbaraya yakṣebhyo yakṣāṇāṃ patye namaḥ ।”

Then he gave her some honey with a silver spoon and asked her to eat it
with the mantra:  
“idaṃ jambhalasya madhu maghonaṃ madhunā prajāvatī payasvatī dhanavatī
dhīmatī ayuṣmatī bhūyāsam |”

Then with another spoon he gave Vrishchika the water with a small amount
of cedar nut oil: “Apply this on your eyelids with the following
mantra:  
“kuberasyodakam idam tenādṛṣṭaṃ dṛṣṭam bhavati huṃ nakulahastāya svāhā
|”

Vrishchika: “Ah this is the pratikṛti of the water sent by Viteśa to
help Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa penetrate the māyā of Meghanāda\!”

Indrasena: “Indeed. Then you shall close your eyes, visualize the great
cave in the Himalayan heights where Kubera has placed the pot of golden
kauberaka honey and meditate upon it doing japa of the mantra:  
oṃ hrīṃ vaiśravaṇa\! dhanaṃ puṣṭiṃ dehi me svāhā |  
When you have become sthiramati emerge from your meditation uttering oṃ
vaiśravaṇa arthatamom। 3 X huṃ phaṭ|”

After Vrishchika did so she emerged from her dhyāna uttering: “apaśyaṃ
tvā yakṣam ugraṃ tvāṣṭrīṃ vimānarūḍhaṃ puruścakrāṇi sahasra-vandhurāṇi ।
sa vaiśravaṇo rājarājā mahato mahīyān yasya pratigraheṇāpsyāmi dhanaṃ
meru-tulyam । kāmam pratigacchāmi । dhanam pratigacchāmi । prajāḥ
pratigacchami । īśvareṇa mahado3 o3 oṃ ||”

Indrasena: “That’s good it appears you are on the path of īśvara-siddhi.
I know you already have accomplishments as a mantravādinī but before
proceeding I need to know if you have studied your earlier siddhānta-s
well. Utter and expound the dvādaśa-nāmāni.”  
Vrishchika: “I do know them from my sarvādhikāra-dīkṣa:  
dhanadaś ca yakṣapatir vitteśo nidhipālakaḥ ।  
rākṣasādhipatiś caiva piṅgalākṣo vimānagaḥ ॥  
rudrasakhā kuberaś ca guhyakānāṃ patis tathā ।  
vaiśravaṇeśvaraś caiva yakṣendraḥ parikīrtitaḥ ||

Dhanada: the giver of wealth; Yakṣapati: the lord of the yakṣa-s;
Vitteśa: the lord of wealth; Nidhipālaka: the guardian of wealth;
Rākṣasādhipati: the lord of the Rakṣa-s, this has been already stated
in the Yajuṣ and the Atharvaṇa-śruti-s; Piṅgalākṣa: he whose eyes are of
a golden tint; Vimānaga: one who can go anywhere on his Puṣpaka
airplane; Rudrasakhā: friend of Rudra, this has been explained in our
national epic; Rudra with his family often resides in the space station
of Kubera; Kubera: One who has a frightful form; Guhyakānāṃ pati: lord
of the hidden yakṣa-s who in the śruti are known as tirodhā; Vaiśravaṇa:
the lord of the northern garden-land known as Viśravas; īśvara: the
great lord; Yakṣendra: who is like Indra among the Yakṣa-s.”

Indrasena: “Great. At some future point when we are united after passing
beyond the place known as Mlecchadigdvāravṛtti we shall perform together
the great yāga as enjoined in the Taittirīya-śruti concluding with the
mantra rājādhirājāya… By that time I would have mastered the full
rahasya-s of this very mysterious mantra of the Bhṛgu-s from the
Atharvaveda:

yad indrādo dāśarājñe  
mānuṣaṃ vi gāhathāḥ |  
virūpaḥ sarvasmā āsīt  
saha yakṣāya kalpate ||

But for now you may do puraścaraṇa of the antardhānāstra-mantra. It will
provide us with the fury needed withstand the assault of the
ekarākṣasavādin-s who would seek to place in the museum in that
great clash in the future.”

Vrishchika: “That sounds frightening. Tell me more of how one approaches
this rahasya?”  
Indrasena: “The full vidhi goes thus: One observes fast on the dvitīya.
Then on tṛtīya one performs the rite having broken ones fast. One places
an image of the gadā in a golden or silver vessel with ghee on which has
been inscribed the 12 names of the yakṣa. One invokes Kubera with the
following mantra enjoined by the Vaikhānasa-s:  
rāyas-poṣāya āyuṣe prajāyai nīdhīśam āvāhayami ।  
(For increasing prosperity, life and offspring I invoke the lord of
wealth)

Then he does the visualization of Kubera thus:  
atha dhyānam:  
yakṣa-rākṣasa-sainyena guhyakānāṃ gaṇair api |  
yuktaś ca śaṅkha-padmābhyāṃ nidhīnām adhipaḥ prabhuḥ ||  
rājarājeśvaraḥ śrīmān gadāpāṇir dhaneśvaraḥ |  
vimāna-yodhī dhanado vimāne puṣpake sthitaḥ ||  
sa rājarājaḥ suśubhe yuddhārthī naravāhanaḥ |  
prekṣamāṇaḥ śivasakhaḥ sākṣād iva śivaḥ svayam ||

(The lord of wealth, the overlord, is united with yakṣa, rakṣa-s and
guhyaka hosts, as also Śaṅkha and Padmā. The lord of the king of kings,
the wealthy one, the lord of riches holds a mace in his hand. The
airplane-warrior, the giver of wealth is stationed in his Puṣpaka
airplane. He the king of kings, residing in great auspiciousness, eager
in combat, is borne by yakṣa-s known as Nara-s. Watching on, the friend
of Śiva is himself like a second Śiva)

Then as ordained by the Vaikhānasa-s one offers the pūrvārghya of water
in a receptacle with the gāyatrī:  
rāja-rājāya vidmahe dhanādhyakṣyāya dhīmahi|  
tan no yakṣaḥ pracodayāt ||

Then one performs japa and/or homa of the mantra:  
asya mantrasya vadanya ṛṣiḥ । virāṭ chandaḥ ।
antardhāna-dhārin-ugra-kubero devatā ।  
oṃ chaṇḍograyakṣāya huṃ phaṭ tirodhehi sapatnān naḥ svāhā ||

There after one concludes with the incantation of the Śānkhāyana-s:

nainaṃ rakṣo na piśāco hinasti na jambhako nāpy asuro na yakṣaḥ ||  
(Neither rakṣa-s nor piśāca-s, nor jambhaka-s, i.e. Kubera’s agents, nor
asura-s nor yakṣa-s harm him)

Then one offers the madhyamārghya as above with the mantra:  
rudra-sakhāya vidmahe vaiśravaṇāya dhīmahi |  
tan naḥ kuberaḥ pracodayāt ||

Then one recites the stuti:  
dhanasya kāmasya praṇāyakas tvaṃ ।  
sukhasya lābhasya pradāyakas tvaṃ ॥  
vimānagas tvaṃ lokeśvaras tvaṃ ।  
nāmāmi jiṣṇuṃ caṇḍogra-yakṣaṃ ॥  
(You are the leader in wealth and desire;  
You are the giver of happiness and profit;  
You are the airplane-rider the lord of the world  
I salute the conquering fierce formidable yakṣa)

Then one does tarpaṇa with the 12 names in the accusative case.  
Additionally he also offers tarpaṇa to the parivāra:  
ṛddhiṃ tarpayāmi ।  
śriyāṃ tarpayāmi ।  
bhadrāṃ tarpayāmi ।  
nalakūbaraṃ tarpayāmi ।  
maṇibhadraṃ tarpayāmi ।  
śaṅkhaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
padmaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
maṅkanakaṃ tarpayāmi ।  
yakṣa-pārṣadāṃs tarpayāmi ।  
yakṣa-pārṣadīṃs tarpayāmi ॥

One then offers the prasannārghya with the mantra:  
yakṣeśvarāya vidmahe gadā-hastāya dhīmahi |  
tan no yakṣaḥ pracodayāt ||

One then makes offering of pure cooked food as bali with mantra ordained
by the Vaikhānasa-s:  
rāja-rājo dhanādhyakṣaḥ kubero viśravas-patiḥ |  
prīyatāṃ nidhi-saṃyukta īśvarasya sakhā prabhuḥ ||  
(The king of kings, the administrator of wealth, Kubera, the lord of the
northern land of Viśravas, possessed of wealth, the friend of Rudra, may
the lord be pleased)

Then he does upasthāna:  
parivāreṇa saha kubero nakulahastaḥ suprīto suprasanno varado yathā
sthānaṃ tiṣṭhatu ||  
(With his retinue may Kubera, holding a mongoose, pleased and happy,
boon-giving remain in his own region)”

Indrasena then continued: “One performs this vrata for an year observing
restraints of not consuming alcohol and eating pure food and maintaining
one’s body with discipline.”  
Vrishchika: “I express my profuse gratitude to you for revealing the
vidhi. I am hoping to perform the vidhi even as you have described it.
But the only issue is how I might be able to obtain the gadā?”  
Indrasena: “I will be duly sending you one. Again most only attain
partial īśvarasiddhi. Only those born of good families for multiple
generations attain that complete siddhi. In Gomūtra-nagara lived a man
who saw all these vidyā-s but his discipline was incomplete so his lābha
was also incomplete. Likewise with the vaṅgasiṃha. But fearlessly
perform the puraścaraṇa. Someday all will come together.”  
Vrishchika: “We will not be able see each other from some time in the
coming future as our paths diverge but in the future we shall be united
again and shall perform the great yāga.”
