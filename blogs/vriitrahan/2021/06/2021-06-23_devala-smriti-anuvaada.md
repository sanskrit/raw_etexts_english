The Devala Smriti is a little known hindu smR^iti that is dated to
800-900 AD by Padma Bhushan PV Kane. The text was likely composed after
the Arab invasions of Sindh, to formulate clear cut guidelines to purify
those Hindus who had been abducted or raped by mlecchas or to reconvert
those who had been converted to Islam (or made to consume beef, etc
other prohibited foods). The Smriti did not have an English translation
so I have translated it. There might be some errors but should more or
less the meaning shall be conveyed. I have posted it on both archive.org
and on the blog here. Important verses are glossed word by word.
