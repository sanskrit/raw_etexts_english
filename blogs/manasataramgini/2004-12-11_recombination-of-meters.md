A technique of Chandas transformation is the circular permutation, which
is used in the ShoDashin soma pouring. Here offerings of soma are made
to indra with 5 specialized anuShTubh mantras called indra juShasva.
They are derived from R^iks originally in the atharva veda in the rare
and peculiar svarAj meter (shaunaka AV 2.5.1-3). The svarAj has a total
of 34 syllables in a mantra. The total of 5 svarAj mantras are derived
by repeating the first R^ik 3 time, as is typical of a shastra
recitation. Thus we get 34\*5=170 syllables.

1\) indra juShasva pra vahA yAhi shUra haribhyAM / pibA sutasya mater
iha madhosh chakAnash chArur madAya //

15:19 (\*3 times)

2\) indra jaTaraM navyo na pR^iNasva madhor divo na / asya sutasya
s\[u\]varN\[a\]\[u\]opa tvA madAH suvAcho aguH //

16:18

3\) indras turAShAN mitro vR^itraM yo jaghAna yatir na / bibheda valaM
bhR^igur na sasahe shatrUn made somasya //

16:18

From these 5\*32=160 syllables are taken to make 5 anuShTubhs

It is done in the following manner: the svarAjs of 34 syllables are

split up as below

32+2

30+4

28+6

26+8

24+10

then the following combinations are made: to make the new anuShTubh

mantras:

32 : 2+30 : 4 +28 : 6+26 : 8+24 : —\>10

That residue of 10 syllables is then used up as preceeding chant in the
second part of the ShoDashi pouring.

The recombination of gAyatri and pankti is described in the aitareya
brAhmaNa 4.1.3 as a part of the chant in the part 2 of the ShoDashin
rite, generally performed before the atirAtra. The first part contains
the indra juShasva permutation (the svarAj mantras of chyavAno bhArgava)
that I described earlier. The below technique is the celebrated
viharaNaM or the intertwining of meters.

The gayatri of medhAtithi KANva RV 1.16.1 :

A tvA vahantu harayo . vR^iShaNaM somapItaye . / indra tvA sUracakShasaH
. //

24= 3\*8 as 8+8 / 8 // (padas marked as .) mantra=1

The pankti of gotamo rAhUgaNa 1.84.10 :

svAdor itthA viShUvato . madhvaH pibanti gauryaH . /  
yA indreNa sayAvarIr . vR^iShNA madanti shobhase . vasvIr anu svarAjyam
. //

40=5\*8 as 8+8 / 8+8+8 // (padas marked as .) mantra=2

pankti+gayatri=64=2\*32= 2\*anuShTubh as 2\* ( 8+8 / 8+8 //)

simple vyuDha generation of 2 anuShTubhs from above:

A tvA vahantu harayas (1) . svAdor itthA viSUvataH (2) . /  
vR^iShaNaM somapItaye (1) . madhvaH pibanti gauryO3 (2) . // 

(new anuShTubh 1)

indra tvA sUracakShaso (1) . yA indreNa sayAvarIr (2) . /  
vR^iShNA madanti shobhase . vasvIr anu svarAjyO3 . (2) //

(new anuShTubh 2)

Note the endings of the new verses in the shastra:

gauryO3 ; svarAjyO3 are sung out with an “ooo” in a musical tone for

the purpose of the shAstra.
