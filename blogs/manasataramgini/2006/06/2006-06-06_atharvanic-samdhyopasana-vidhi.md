The practioners of the fourth veda are dying creed. As we may be amongst
the very last of the practioners and some who are learning it in a
recent revival do not known of how the atharvaNa saMdhya needs to be
done we provide some details. As this is a common question asked by the
atharvan revivalists, with time I hope to provide a detailed protocol of
atharvan saMdhya, atharvan upAkarma and some other important para-vedic
rites of the atharvan-s like the skanda yAga or the dhUrta homa. Here is
an outline for the saMdhya

- The AV saMdhya is done seated in the Urdhva-jAhnuH vIrAsana.  
- It is to be done in the north or east of the place of residence and
facing the sun.  
- before it one purifies himself with the ApohiShThiya ablution.  
- One sips water (AchamanaM) with the formula jIvA stha
(AV-S19.69.1-4)  
- One sprinkles water on oneself with formula Apo hi ShTha (AV-S1.5).
One touches ones knees when the incantation yas-yakShayAya jinvata is
uttered.  
- One says agnishcha mA manyushcha and suryashcha mA manyushca
purificatory formulae.  
- One performs three prAnAyAma-s with the 7
vyAhR^iti-s+gAyatrI+brahma-shiras.  
- One performs AchamanaM as above again.  
- One stands up and throws water upwards with the formula ayojAla
(AV-S19.66)  
- One faces the sun and chants the formula as per the saMdhya:  
morning- hariH suparNa (AV-S19.65.)  
noon- ud u tyaM + ud vayaM tamasaH (AV-S20.47.13+AV-S7.53.7)  
evening-ud ghed abhi (AV-S20.7)  
- One then performs gAyatrI japa 8, 11, 12, 15, 100 or 1000 times.  
- Then one stands up again and utters the formula pashyema sharadaH
(AV-S19.67)  
- Then one chants still standing AV-S19.70, 19.71, 12.1.18, 10.5.37,
19.16, 19.72
