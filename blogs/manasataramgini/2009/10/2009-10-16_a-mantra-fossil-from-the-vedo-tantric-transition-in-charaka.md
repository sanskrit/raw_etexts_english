The chikitsAsthAna of the charaka saMhitA cites a formula to be recited
during the compounding of the agada termed the mahAgandhahasti
(23.90):  
*mama mAtA jayA nAma jayo nAmeti me pitA |  
sohaM jayajayAputro vijaye.atha jayAmi cha |  
namaH puruShasiMhAya viShNave vishvakarmaNe |  
sanAtanAya kR^iShNAya bhavAya vibhavAya cha |  
tejo vR^iShakapeH sAkShAt tejo brahmendroyor yame |  
yathA a.haM nAbhijAnAmi vAsudevaparAjayam |  
mAtush cha pANigrahaNaM samudrasya cha shoShaNam |  
anena satyavAkyena siddhyatAm agado hy ayam |  
hili mili saMspR^iShTe rakSha sarva bheShajottame svAhA ||*

The agada is a preparation that it specially used to kill or counter a
disease-causing agent or poison and is contrasted from other drugs which
help to provide nutrients or enhance particular functions. This
mahAgandhahasti formula is interesting in several ways. In its opening
part it has a peculiar formulaic structure of X is the mother, Y is the
father etc. This is a very old atharvanic formula and is seen right from
an early atharvanic spell in the R^igveda (RV10.97.9; iShkR^itir nAma vo
mAtA) and similar forms in the atharvaveda. Interestingly, it is praised
thus:  
*yatra cha sannihito.ayaM na tatra bAlagrahA na rakShAMsi |  
na cha kArmaNa vetAlA vahanti nAtharvaNa mantrAH || (23.88)**  
* When it is applied or placed \[on a person\] it is supposed to protect
against bAlagraha-s, rakSha-s, abhichAra rites, vetAla-s and atharvanic
mantra-s. Thus, its structure and its “target”, i.e. the AV mantra-s
suggest that it belongs to a relatively early period, prior to the
ascendancy of the classical tAntrika material. Yet on the other hand we
encounter elements that link it to the tAntrika mantra shAstra such as
the formula “hili mili”. Moreover, we note that while it invokes a wide
range of deities (i.e. viShNu, bhAva=rudra?, vR^iShakapi, brahma, indra
and yama), the most prominent deity here is viShNu. Specifically his
vibhava-s such as puruShasiMha (nR^isiMha) and kR^iShNa are mentioned
and perhaps even vR^iShakapi here is identified with viShNu. Also
mentioned is vAsudeva, a name not found in the earlier vaidika layer of
the vaiShNava shAsana, but emerging in the vaikhAnasa and pA\~ncharAtra
traditions. There is hardly any mention of nR^isiMha in the great epic
which already contains early allusions to pA\~ncharAtra and vaikhAnasa.
However, nR^isiMha is prominent alongside with vAsudeva and the vyUha-s
in the vaikhAnasa mantra-pATha. Hence, we suspect that this mantra from
charaka belongs to the same layer as the vaiShNava mantra material of
the vaikhAnasa mantra-pATha, which probably post-dates their precursors
alluded to in the great epic. The mantra also preserves an old style
Indo-European oath statement (satyavAkya) albeit with a vaiShNava
statement — i.e. just as I do not know of the defeat of vAsudeva, and
just as one does not take ones mother’s hand in marriage and just as the
ocean does not dry up so also let this drug be successful. This again
suggests that the mahAgandhahasti is a “fossil” mantra from the
transitional period from the vaidika and tantrika mantra-shAstra-s along
side other such examples we have previously pointed out, such as those
of the AV parishiShTha-s. This may also be significant in being one of
the relatively early vaiShNava mantra-s to mention narasiMha and gives a
small window into the pre-classical mantra-s of the vaiShNava-shAsana.
