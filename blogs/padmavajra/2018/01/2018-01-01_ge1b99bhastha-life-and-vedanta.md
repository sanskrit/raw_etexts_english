This thread and the succeeding comments made me remember the small notes
from an orthodox sannyāsin and a friend of mine,and I am putting them in
a jumbled form here.

So,in orthodox circles,there are three commentaries on the Gītā that are
famous.

1.  Ādi Śaṅkara’s commentary-corresponds to śravana
2.  Madhusudanasarasvatī’s commentary-corresponds to manana
3.  Shankarananda’s commentary-corresponds to nidhidhyānsana(and these
    are studied in that order).

So, Śaṅkarānanda in his commentary on the 3rd chapter of the Gita states
that a brāhmaṇa should not renounce until he has fulfilled the three
ṛṇas(debts).

1.  Deva-ṛṇa(debt to the devas) by performing yāgas as laid out in the
    śruti
2.  Ṛṣirṇa(debt to the ṛṣis) by doing vedādhyayanam of svaśākhā and
    other vedas
3.  Pitṛ ṛṇa(debt to the forefathers) by begetting a child legitimately
    \[and obviously raising him/her properly and so on and so forth\]

As a note:On asking that friend,he suggested(for caturthas),the ṛṇas
would be discharged as

1.  Deva-ṛṇa-worship devas through the paddhatis
    available(paurāṇika/tāntrika)
2.  Ṛṣirṇa-propagate vedāṇgas/itihāsa/tantra
3.  Pitṛ ṛṇa-same as the one for dvijas

(Note:This doesn’t mean that brāhmaṇas/other dvijas cannot pass on
tāntrika/itihāsa/other lore)

So,the tradition already has the solution within itself,and it needs to
be revitalized.

Also,what Bajirao did would be quite inappropriate from an Advaitin’s
point of view. Śrīdharasvāmīn in his gloss on the very first śloka
states

‘iha khalu sakalavanditacaraṇaḥ paramakāruṇuko bhagavān
devakīnandanastattvajñānavijṛmbhita-śokamohavibhraṃśita-vivekatayā
**nijadharmaparityāga-pūrvakaparadharmābhisandhinamarjunaṃ**
dharmajñānarahasyopadeśaplavena tasmācchokamohasāgaraāduddhāraḥ\|..’



A short summary(with emphasis on the bolded words would be that the
ever-worshippable Śrī Kṛṣṇa rescued Arjuna from the sea of sorrow and
delusion,under *whose influence he was about to give up his own
svadharma(of a warrior and ruler)* and take up another’s dharma(that of
an ascetic) by imparting to him, jṇānarahasyopadeśa. The Peshva had
committed that same mistake Arjuna had done(maybe due to a different
cause),and could hardly be said to be upholding vedantic ideals.
