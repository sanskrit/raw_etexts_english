On seeing this article on the [ecology and solitude of
kShetras](https://www.sirfnews.com/if-state-is-our-enemy-in-sabarimala-were-ours-in-vaishno-devi/)
by Ashish Dhar as far as I understand(Surajit Dasgupta’s name ended up
there by mistake),I have a few comments to make.

1.  There is a section of Hindus who are rightly worried about the
    demographic concerns of Hindus vis-a-vis Muslims and want to have
    more Hindus than Muslims in a comfortable proportion. This is a good
    aim in itself,yes. But one cannot really talk about this on one hand
    and then complain when the population load avails themselves of the
    same kShetras ever increasing and shrine boards taking the
    inevitable changes in infrastructure to manage this load;they cannot
    really ignore the increasing numbers of pilgrims. This being India
    at its current stage,something eventually gives way:Either solitude
    or environment or cleanliness(if it is ill managed). Hindus who have
    both these issues in mind cannot have their cake and eat it.
2.  Ashish Dhar once got into a heated debate with some other people
    regarding places like Kedarnath etc. I had made a suggestion
    elsewhere,which I am recording here for more visibility: In the case
    of places like Kedar we can make replica kShetras in other
    places(with the same energy and shakti of the devatA),so that people
    can visit these and have their spiritual needs fulfilled. This is
    however very much easier than done(since we don’t seem to be
    cultivating the sort of tapasvI or niyamadhAri types to be able to
    cultivate that kind of shakti for such replica kShetras). Example in
    this vein could be the Balaji temples TTD is building(all vaikhAnasa
    run I think). Even if it is much easier than done,it is still
    worthwhile to put efforts in that direction and cultivate
    environments suitable for sAdhanA and tapasyA.
