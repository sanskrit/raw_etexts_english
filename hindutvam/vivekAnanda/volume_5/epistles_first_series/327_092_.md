## XCII

RIDGELY,  
*2nd September, 1899*.

DEAR —,

. . . Life is a series of fights and disillusionments. . . . The secret
of life is not enjoyment, but education through experience. But, alas,
we are called off the moment we begin really to learn. That seems to be
a potent argument for a future existence. . . . Everywhere it is better
to have a whirlwind come over the work. That clears the atmosphere and
gives us a true insight into the nature of things. It is begun anew, but
on adamantine foundations. . . .

Yours with best wishes,

VIVEKANANDA.
