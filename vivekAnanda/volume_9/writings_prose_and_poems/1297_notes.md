## NOTES

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 3, pp. 440-41.)

*\[An undated and untitled, one-page manuscript in Swami Vivekananda's
own handwriting\]*

My nerves act on my brain — the brain sends back a reaction which, on
the mental side, is this world.

Something — x — acts on the brain through the nerves, the reaction is
this world.

Why not the x be also in the body — why outside?

Because we find the *already created outside* world (as the result of a
previous *reaction* of the brain) acts on us calling on a further
reaction.

Thus inside becomes outside and creates another action, which interior
action created another reaction, which again becomes outside and again
acts inside.

The only way of reconciling idealism and realism is to hold that one
brain can be affected by the *world* created as reaction by another
brain from inside, i.e., the mixture x + mind which one brain throws out
can affect another, to which it's similarly external.

Therefore as soon as we come within the influence of this hypnotic
circle, or influence, created by hundreds of preceding brains we begin
to feel this world as they see it.

Mind is only a phase of matter, i.e., of the ever-changing phenomena of
which matter and mind are different states or views. There must be
something in whose presence this eternal, phenomenal net is spread —
that is the Substance, the Brahman.
