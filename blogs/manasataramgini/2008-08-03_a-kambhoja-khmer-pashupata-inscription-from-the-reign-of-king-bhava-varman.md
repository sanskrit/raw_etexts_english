title = "A Kambhoja (Khmer) pAshupata inscription from the reign of kingxa0bhava-varman"

+++
A Sanskrit inscription from the Phnom Prah Vihar hillock in Cambodia,
copied by the French researcher Coedes (IC. 3), provides a further
illustration of the point discussed our earlier note on the link between
nyAya-vaisheShika and the pAshupata-s. It also underscores the point of
how the pAshupata-s appear to have dispersed these philosophical systems
widely over Asia. The inscription is associated with king bhava-varman
of Kambhoja. A large number of inscriptions appear to be of the king
bhava-varman-I who founded a new Kambhoja kingdom by annexing Funan and
Vietnam to his Cambodian base. This would place it around 590 CE when he
was at his peak. There was a second bhava-varman, his successor 3rd in
line (in the earlier half of 600s of CE). But the lack of mention of
bhava-varman-II’s father ishAna-varman makes it likely that the king of
this inscription was bhava-varman-I the founder of the dynasty. The
inscription is in the AryA Chandas and refers to a pAshupata AchArya
vidyApuShpa. The extant of the surviving portion of the inscription is 9
verses and is broken towards the end. I just provide a few excerpts.

jayati indu ravi vyoma vAyvAtm\[a/A\]-kSmA jalaanalaiH |  
tanoti tanubhish- shambhur-yoShTAbhir-akhila\~n-jagat || (1)  
A praise of shambhu in his universal manifestation.

rAjA shrI-bhava-varmeti bhavaty adhika-shAsanaH |  
soma-vaMshayo.apy ari-dhvAnta pradhvaMsana divAkaraH || (3)  
A praise of the king bhava-varman of the lunar race.

tasya pAshupatAchAryaH vidyApuShpAhvayaH kaviH |  
shabda-vaisheShika-nyAya-tattvArtha-kR^ita-nishchayaH || (4)  
This verse describes the pAshupatAchArya vidyApuShpa who is mentioned as
a scholar of shabda (=grammar) and vaisheShika and nyAya.

Then the inscription goes on to describe the dream manifestation of
rudra to the Acharya and his endowment to the shiva shrine of cows,
land, gold and attendants
