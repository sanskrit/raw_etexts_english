She said that she was shoNitamekhalA, the barmaid from the glorious
oDDiyAna. We excitedly asked her teaching of the amaraugha. She said:
somAkhyaH pathena gachChati | hAlApIvI devadattaM pathena gamayati |
pathaM vR^iNIShva || (somAkhya goes by the path; hAlApIvin makes
devadatta go by the path; choose a path for yourself.) Then she then
became silent, showed the sign of the three fingers, and went away
stating that customers were waiting at the counter.

Then we proceeded to the cluster of caves in kR^iShNagiri in the country
of the rAShTraka-s. As we were about to enter the chosen cave sutvachA
the fair daughter of the brAhmaNa crossed our path. She asked: “Did you
understand the teachings of shoNitamekhalA”. We said we were still
seeking their meaning. She went away giggling. There in the cave where
the Iranian lord had performed a homa to rudra sat the yamoghaNTa named
antakabhR^itya. He asked pointed to a rocky seat and said: “About two
thousand years ago the Iranian lord sat there; he is long dead and
mostly forgotten today but take that seat. We shall now study some
poetry.” Then he went on to expound three verses from fifty known as the
vakrokti pa\~nchAshika of Kashmirian kavi bhaTTa ratnAkara from the
court of rAjan avantivarman:

tvaM hAlAhala-bhR^it karoShi manaso mUrchAM mamAli\~Ngito  
hAlAM naiva bibharmi naiva cha halaM mugdhe kathaM hAlikaH |  
satyaM hAlikataiva te samuchitAsaktasya govAhane  
vakroktyeti jito himAdri-sutayA smero harah pAtu vaH || 2  
When embraced by me you make my mind dizzy – \\with the \[noxious\]
hAlAhala you hold.\\by the beer and plow (water) you hold.\\  
Silly lady\! I hold neither beer nor a plow, how am I a plowman?  
Truth to be told the state of a plowman is appropriate for your
attachment – \\to the bovine vehicle\\to plying the bovine.  
May hara smiling while thus defeated via use of vakrokti (ambiguous
speech/punning words) by the daughter of the Himalayas protect you.

The pun here creates an equivalence between rudra the holder of the
hAlAhala and the saMkarShaNa of the pA\~ncharAtrika-s who holds the hala
and hAlA. Indeed, the mahAbharata mentions that balarAma, the earthly
manifestation of the saMkarShaNa, is pacified when a bowl of beer is
placed before him by the fair hands of his wife revatI. The poet bhAsa
makes a word play on this in the open verse of his play the
svapnavAsavadatta thus:  
udayanavendusavarNAvAsavadattAbalau balasya tvAm |  
padmAvatIrNapUrNau vasantakramau bhujau pAtAm ||

May bala\[rAma\]’s arms protect you, whose color is like the newly
arisen moon, imparted vigor by beer, enhanced by padmAvatI (supposed to
mean revatI here), like the pleasant progression of spring. It also
plays on the names of the menage-a-trois in the drama comprised of king
udayana, his wife vAsavadattA and the princess padmAvatI

But this beer-swilling saMkarShaNa in the pA\~ncharAtrika tradition is
indeed an equivalent of rudra and performs the same functions as him.
Hence, the word play in this verse indicates the homology between the
deities is indicated. Moreover, rudra denying his association with beer
indicates his domesticated state. This is different from his wild state
as a manifestation of the violent principle inherent in beer – a point
alluded to in the shruti (e.g. [shatapatha
brAhmaNa](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/notes-on-the-vishnu-virachita-rudra-stotram/ "Notes on the viShNu-virachita rudra stotram"))
in the context of the sautrAmaNi ritual. It also distinguishes him from
the state where accompanied by the many female deities, the one in which
alcoholic beverage is a sacrament as in the tantra-s of the
bhairava-srotas.

\\You are not loved by me \\menA likes you\\; Indeed, my mother-in-law
likes me, O pretty-bodied one.  
Well played (said) by you; \[but\] I am saying it again:\\you are not
liked by me\\you are a rudrAkSha tree (have rudrAkSha-s piled on
you).\\  
But I’m not piled up with rudrAkSha-s, silly lady, look at me\!  
May hara silencing with his punning words the smiling faced one born of
the Himalayas protect you.

Here rudra is in his domesticated form stated above; hence, he is not
piled up with rudrAkSha-s.

\\I resent our truce\\I resent \[your\] flirting with saMdhyA\\ and no
more in your body I will stay.  
Pretty-thighs\! If you are not happy with the truce simply say that.
Should I \[then\] call declare \\hostilities?\\a hunt for catching
birds?\\  
You rascal\! Of what use is this business of catching birds to me.  
May the punning words of shiva and shivA contesting in this game bring
you to felicities.

The catching of birds (vi-graha) is an allusion to rudra being called a
pu\~njiShTha in the shruti. But you must note that here umA has called
rudra a rascal and clearly told him of her lack of love for him and
expressed her intention not to stay in his body. Hence, he has to wander
on his own.

Most worship mahAdeva along with his shakti. This is the
sAdhAraNa-patha. The ecstatic and high kulapatha is that of rudra as
vIra in the midst of his kula with the yoginI-s, DAkinI-s and shAkinI-s.
But now that sati has left him he is an ekavIra. The one who follows
that path shall explore the mysteries of the akulavIra.

We said: “But then they say shiva without shivA is but a shava. So how
could one tread the path of the akulavIra”.  
The yamoghaNTha: “Close your eyes.”  
We found ourselves in the draMiDa country near where the land meets the
sea. There was an image of the old goddess patnI, who had been worshiped
by the drAviDa-s in the long past days even as the Iranian was
performing his homa to maheshvara. It was a grim and inauspicious day.
Yet, everyone around us was laughing and talking in loud tones trying to
make themselves heard over the din. Tired from the exertions of the long
day we laid ourselves near a large image of kumAra to get some rest.
Suddenly, a band of shAkinI-s arrived and tore us to shreds eating us up
entirely.  
We opened our eyes and asked: “Are we dead?”  
The yamoghaNTha: “Close your eyes again.”  
We were in the holy city of jAlandhara in the pa\~nchanada country.
There were three corpses in the biers which were laid beside us. All of
a sudden one of them started moving and then getting up made a loud and
terrible noise. We were reminded of kShemendra’s words
“ghora-pherAvahuMkR^itaM”. We opened our eyes and asked: “Why did that
one who was dead move?”  
The yamoghaNTha: “It was animated by a vetAla captured by
shoNitamekhalA.”  
We: “You are indeed a yamoghaNTha without the chitra-paTa-s (painted
scrolls)”.  
The yamoghaNTha: “Go the mouth the cave and gaze at the yonder sky.”  
We: “A flock of egrets in flight.”  
The yamoghaNTha: “the old bhAsa had said:  
vidUShaka- hI hI, sharat kAla nirmale .antarikShe
prasArita-baladeva-bAhu-darshanIya sArasa-pa\~Nkti yAvat samAhitaM

The jester: Hey hey, may your highness see that flock of cranes flying
in the clear autumnal welkin like the outstretched arm of baladeva.  
The king: friend, I see these.  
Sometimes straight, sometime dispersed wide apart, sometimes in a
V-shaped configuration,  
taking the form the constellation of the seven seers (Ursa Major) while
turning,  
like the white belly of a snake which has sloughed its skin,  
\[the flock\] is like a dividing contour on the surface of the sky.

This old bhAsa must have been a bit of a pA\~ncharAtrika. The
saMkarShaNa indeed stirs things up, much like the atmospheric dance of
the crane flock. That is what one might see in the simile which likens
his fair hand to them. Then there is also the welkin in you which is the
chidAkAsha. These birds are tracing paths on that. Those are the
movements of prANa that we term the ajapA gAyatrI, the mantra, so.ahaM
haMsaH |

It is that mantra you now go forth and try to master. It must be done in
solitude. As you leave the fair daughter of the brAhmaNa will come you
path. But you have to walk past her for no use will come of coitus with
her. But three ladies whose names will have the initial consonants p, v,
and b will keep you company – but remember their company will be even
like that of hatyA who gave the bhairava company till he drank viShNu’s
blood. You might die on the path sooner or later and might become the
dwelling of a vetAla. The end only you will know”

We were not sure if we were dead or alive.
