### (*New York Daily Tribune* May 3, 1894)  A Lecture on India and Reincarnation

Swami Virekanmda \[sic\] lectured on “India and Reincarnation” last
evening at the home of Miss Mary Phillips, No. 19 West Thirty-eighth-st.
(Of which no verbatim transcript is available.) He mentioned among other
salient points regarding Hindooism, or Brahminism, that their religion
bore no distinctive name; that it was considered that a belief in the
truth of all creeds was religion, and that the belief that one certain
dogma was the real and only religion was sect. The Karmic law of cause
and effect was explained, also the external and internal natures in
their close relations to each other. The actions in this world, as
governed by a previous life and the change to still another life, were
dwelt upon in detail..
