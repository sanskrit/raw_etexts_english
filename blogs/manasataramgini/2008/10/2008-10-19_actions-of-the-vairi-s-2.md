Yesterday, the grAhin, which had been kept at bay for a day came back to
needle us. We called upon rudra to bear us aid in the second hour past
mid-night and used the apsarA to relieve us from the grAhin. Today
(19th) around 11.25 AM we were attacked by the cheTaka again, who also
tried to sneak in the grAhin on us. Having draw-up the draw-bridge we
remained cloistered in our fort. We could hear the cheTaka repeatedly
banging on our doors. After about 45 minutes the cheTaka retreated.

The cycle repeated itself today. The cheTaka kept a vigorous attack on
us and the uShNa also failed to our disadvantage. We resolutely eluded
the cheTaka, but the grAhin grabbed us. By the afternoon of our day we
were so overwhelmed that we had to use the indra-shakti, the six arrows
on which we hung. The grAhin was not shaken by the first of these
arrows, we had only 5 more. We felt worse than karNa – at least he had
killed ghaTotkacha in the end. Was it the final mAraNa? Journey to the
realms of vaivasvata is not so much a cause of fear as reaching there
slowly.
