## A GOD EVERY DAY[1](#fn1)

\[*Detroit Tribune*, February 19, 1894\]

RABBI GROSSMAN IS REFRESHED BY SWAMI VIVE KANANDA

. . . "I take your Jesus," Kananda said last Saturday evening \[February
17\]. (*Vide* “The Divinity of Man” ([*Complete Works*, III:
496-501](../../../volume_3/reports_in_american_newspapers/the_divinity_of_man.htm)
) and “Is India a Benighted Country?” ([*Complete Works*, IV:
198-202](../../../volume_4/lectures_and_discourses/is_india_a_benighted_country.htm)
).)

I take him to my heart as I take all the great and good of all lands and
of all times. But you, will you take my Krishna to your heart? No — you
cannot, you dare not — still you are the cultured and I am the heathen.
