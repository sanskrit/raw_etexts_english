VOLUME XL 
No. l.-AN INSCRIPTION AT DEVAGERI. 
BY J. J1 . FLEET, LO.S. (RSTD,), Pfl<D., O.I.B. 
This inscription has been mentioned by me in vol. 5 above, p. 172 : and I have given a brief statement of the purport of it under No, 29 in my List of Spurious Records in the Ind. Ant, , vol. 30 (1901), p. 217, I publishit now for the first time, and give a facsimile of it from au ink-impression mada for me by Mr. Kalyan Sitaram Ohitre in 1 890, "when (if my memoryis correct) he was Mamlatdar of the Sampgaum taluka of the Belgan.niDistrict. 
The inscription is on a stone which was found in a field, SurveyNo. 85,afc Devageri, a village about six miles west-by-south from Karajgi,the head-quartersof the Karajgi taluka, Dharwar District, The Indian Atlas sheet No. 42 (1827) shews the placeas(Eewgeeree'. The Map of the Dharwar Oollectorate (1874) shews it as 'Deogeree'. The Postal Directory of the Bombay Circle (1879) presentsits name as 'Deogiri', And the Dharwar volume (1884) of the Bombay Gazetteer treats it as'Devgiri' (p. 665). In connexion with some early Kadamba copperplate records which were obtained at this village,I originally gaveits name asfDevagiri ',l in accordance with those spellings, SubsequentlyI was givento anderstand that the cultivators call it(Devagere ', and that this should be taken as its real name : and I have sometimes used this form.2 Since then, however,I have ascertained that a record of A.D, 1075 in the temple of Basavanna at the village itself distinctly givesits name as Devamgeri, as also does a record of -the period A.D. 121047 at the templeof Martandadeva at a neighbouring village, Kolur : also, that the impression of a reoord of A,D. 1121 in the templeof Basavanna, while leaving it doubtful whether the original does or does not present the anusvara, again, distinctly givesthe second component of the name as geri, and thufc yields either Devariigeri or Devageri, Further, Mr. K. S. Chitre, while writing the name on the impressionssent by him to me as*Devagiri' iu English characters, accordingto the official spelling, wrote it as*Devageri ', in rt>e sume place, in the Modi or current Marathi characters. I therefore entertain uo doubt that what the culti 
vators really call the village is, not*Dgvagere' (as reportedto me), but Devageri, and that this 
1 2nd, Ant., vol. 7, p, 33 : and I Tiave used the form*Diogiri'in vol. 5 above, p. 172.

EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. [VOL. XL   
is the form of the name that should be used.1 At the same time, in justification to a certain extent of the official form of the name, I may state that a record of A.D. 1674 ou a pillarin the same temple of Basavarma does distinctly presentthe name as Devagiri, and thus carries back the corrupt form for an appreciabletime. The inscription now published does not mention the 
name Devarageri in any form, but speaks oulyof a villagecalled Palarur. This name seems to be another form, by transposition,2 of the name which we have as Paralur (Ind. Ant., vol. 11, p. 70) in the iDSGi'iption of the time of Klrtivarman II (A.D. 746-47 and 757) at Adiir, about eight miles south-west- by-west from Devageri, and as Brihat-Paralur (id., vol. 7, p, 35,line 9) in the afcill earlier copperplate grant, of the third yearof Mrigesavarman, which was discovered at Devageri itself. In any case, the purportof our record distinctly implies that the stone which bears it, and which was found in a field in the lands of Devageri, was set upin the village Palarur, and thus' marks Palarur as being then the name of the place.It may be added that the inscription of A.D. 1075, mentioned above, registers an assignmentof tolls, for certain purposes of the god Kankalesvara of Devamgeri, at Devamgeri and Palavur and in the tala, 'site or tract', composed of Eleya-Tam range and two unnamed villages: here wo may possibly Ijave still another form of the name Paralnr, Palarur : but it is difficult to account for the v in the place of the r;and Palavur may be another village which does not now exist. Any such name aa Paralur, Palarnr, and Palavur, is not now found in maps, etc. And the position seems to be that Devageri was originally a devamgerior devapurl,a' god's ward ', of Palarnr ;that the lands of Palariir and some other villages have been absorbed into the lands of Devageri, which is a some what large village ;and that consequentlythe latter name only has survived. The inscription now published places Palariir, tacitly but plainly,in the Banavasi twelve-thousand province. So, also, the record of A.D. 1075 in the same way places Devamgeri, with the other villages mentioned in it. in that same province, and, further,in a division of it known as the Basavura one-hundre d-and-forty . 
&t the top of the stone there are sculptures, showing a bull, recumbent to the right (proper left) and apparently intended for the usual Nandi, and below it, plainly not as a familyor dynastic emblem, but in connexion with the topicof the record, an elephant, standingto the right (proper left), with a man standing behind it with uplifted arms. The writing covers an area about ]/ 8'' broad in lines 9 to 14 by3' 0" high. The stone on which it is engraved seems to 
have been even originally of an irregular shape ;and it is onlyat the end of lines 1 to 8, 17, 20, and 21, and at the beginningof lines 18 to 22, that any portionsof it have been broken 
away. 
The characters are Kanarese, boldly formed and, generally, well executed. In lines 1 to 15 the size of them ranges from about ^", as in the yaof baliyan,line 9, to |", as in the ha of bars, line 15; in lines 16 ff. it increases up to (for single letters) 1|" in the la of sSsirbar, line 19, and it almost eeems that this partof the record may have been written by another hand : the ynu of (M/-nra, line 2, is l|"high : the Inl of masayal^nwan, line 11,is 2" high : and the chchiot mechchi*. dew, line 16, is 2|" high. They are of the general standard of the tenth century A.D. and closely thereabouts. They include both the typesof the initial short i, on which detail seep. 7 ff . below : the earlier type of this vowel occurs in irppatt-,line 2; the later typeis found in idam, line 20 ; also in idan- at the beginningof line 18, where, however,it is mostly broken away. The ftfc, js 6, and 2 are all of the later types j the gutturalnasal n does not occur. No distinction seems to be made between d and d. In chbatra, for chcfthattra,line 6, we have the rare full

form o chh, which necessarily can seldom occur except when, as here,it is used instead of 
chchh. 
The language is Kanarese,of the archaic type, in prose. The record was neatly put together by the use of the satisaptamior locative infinitives ene, lines 10, 11, 14, ire, line 14, bare line 15, and nile, line 15, coupled with the subjunctive or conditional endode,lines 12, 13, 16 And not unworthy of note, in respectof the nicetyof the composition, is tbe 'point that, whereas the remainder of the record, appropriatelycast in pure Kanarese, natnrally presents the words pul, pullu, for 'grass' (lines 11, 14, 15), and ane for 'elephant' (line 15), into the ruling prince's month there are pat (in accordance with the theory of the Hindu drama, that kings and such people should speak Sanskrit) Sanskrit words, woven however into a. Kanarese sentence, which include tnna and hastin.1 Line 7 gives us nevarade, the instrumental 
singular of a word nevara which seems to be a longer form of nera,= ner (3),*straightness, ^ - -r- * i n T i 1 T 1 7 i n i i _T i T T 
under kudu (3).2 
ghosts' lines 12, 17, we have buda,instead of the more usual buta, as a of the Sanskrit bhuta. In arasara and ado, line 12, pulla,line 14, and koyvara,line 15, we have either a careless omission of the final m (n), or, with equal probability, instances of the accusative in a instead of am (fl)3. Line 8 presents the word bali (3), 'a man who calls or invitee' or we may say' a summoner ', in connexion with which the following remarks may be made In the form. bali (withI instead of 1) we have this same word in an unpublished inscription of A.D. 1052 at Niralgiin the Hangal taluka, Dharwar, in a passage which runs: 
eriman-mahilmandalegvaramEarikesaridevar .... srlmad-agraharam Nlriliya mahajanam mnnurvvarige baliyan=attibarisi ;"the illustrious MaliSmandalesvara Harikesarideva , . having sent a summoner to the three-hundred Mahajanas of the holy agrahara Nirili, and having caused them to come,"etc. : and similar passagesoccur in records of A.D. 1074 and 1075 at the same place. And we can now recognizethat we have the word bali itself in line -20 of the Adur inscription (Ind. Ant., vol. 11, p. 70), where, modifying my original rendering,I would translate" The Gurava Prabhachandra,the summoner of the Jain templeof Paralur, obtained this grant." It would seem that, in addition to meaning generally 'any man who calls or invites' the word denoted also a recognizedofficial of some kind, both religious and 
secular. 
In respect of orthography we may note (1) the use of b for v in sambatsara twice in lines 1 to 3 (2) the use of s for s throughout ; (3) the mistakes of 1th for ft in sakliat line 1, of d for dh in samadigata, line 4, and of n for ri in tnna, line 9* 
The inscription can onlybe treated as a spurious record, as which it has been entered under No. 29 in my List of Spurious Eecords in the Ind, Ant,, vol. 30 (1901), p. 217 j because it 
1 This ia the record which I mentioned, from this poiafc of view, in the discussion on"Sanslcpit as a spoken language";see Jour. R. As, Soc.t 1904, 486. 
a Reeve and Sanderson's Dictionary adds the form Jettifagula. The most familiar term is ftudugdl, in its later form kudugolu. 
s According, indeed, to KeSiraja'eSabdamanidarpana,verse 134, and Bhattakal area's Karnatakagabdatmgasana, sutra 281 we might regard some of these ns genitives used in the sense of accusatives. But ada at any rate is not a genitive. And there can be little doubt that Dr. Kittel's opinionis correct; namely, that tno supposition of a use of the genitire for the accusative is unnecessary, and that the accueative in a, frequent enough in the medissval and modacn dialects, existed in also the more ancient colloquial dialect, thoughit had not bean generally accepted by classical writers : see hia Kanafa Grammar, 117, 122, 352. Many instances of the accusative in a can be found in my Kanarese ballads : thus, mata for matannu, Ind. Ant., vol. 14, p. 300, line 3 from the bottom-, ritfa for A'tfamw - riftaww, p. 301, line 1 ; Icarwa for Jcaravanm, line 8 j ySna for yenannu, line 11. It would, in fact, bo pedanticto use the accusative termination in ordinary speech 5 except perhaps with proftouai. *Except, of courae, for Sanskrit words being aimed at here, there would be no objectionto trina.B2

purports to have been framed on a date which is utterly incompatible with the periodto which its characters refer it, As, however, it states (apart from the date) nothing that is in any way unnatural, suspicious, or irreconcilable with the local history for itB true period, we may accept the information given in it as true. It deals with a thing which it calls budagul. This terra is composed of buda, a tadlhaua-fovm of the Sanskrit bMta,ia spirit, goblin, ghost ',and the Kanarese kul, kulu, 'boiled rice'; and it denotes *aa offering of boiled rice to the ghosts'. Other names of the offering are bhstabuli and bhutayajfict,', also the word bali by itself, which is explained in Kitfcel's Kannada-Engliah Dictionaryas meaning, amongst other things,' an offering to demons (especially also Durga or Kali), etc., performed by putting neaps of boiled rice, or by killing sheep, buffaloes, etc., and also men.' As a regular sacrifice, the offering ranked as one of the pan,ciMtnah'ly(ijfiaOL-'five greatsacrifices '; see, for instance, the Manavadharraasiatvaj 3. 70. I have been told, however, that in a more special -way the bhutubali is offered in connexion with the gurbhad&na or ceremony performedto ensure concep tion. I farther learnt from the kt Sir James Campbellthat the bhvtabali is offered in cases of ban-eiiness, from the point of view that that misfortune is due to the inflaence of maliciQus spirits. And we thus obtain a clear explanationaa to why the record represents the village-maidensaa interested in the matter of the brtdiujfil. The inscription mentions a certain ftfakasctmantadkipati or great feudal prlr.ce named Santivarman, who was governingthe Ban.ava.si twelve-thousand province. It describes him as belongingto the Matura race, and fts havingthe hereditary title of "supreme lord of the town Trikundapura ", with reference to the placeof origin of his family, and as possessing the Nandanavaua umbrella, the horse crest, and the mirror banner.1 It recites that Saativarman came, in. the course of a toiir, to PalarQr, and demanded a supply of grass for his horses and elephants. For some reason not stated, the rightto make the offering of boiled rice to the ghosts was in abeyance ; apparently under a sentence of excommunication. Incited by the village-maidens (kojagusugal,Line 11), who said that, if he could get the restriction removed, he might marry as many of them as lie might wish, a man named Allagunda cut a supplyof grassso much to the satisfaction of Santivarman that the latter offered to grant him a boon. Whereupon Allaguuda asked for, and obtained, the restoration of the right to make the offering to the ghosts. As to whether the village maidens kept their promise to him, the record is silent. 
The inscription is dated on a Monday coupled with, the second tithiol the bright fortnightof Margasira of the KaUvukta sa,mv(tts(ira, t Saka-sariivat 522. This date/ however, is obviously not authentic: and all else that need be said about it is aa follows. By th,e mean-sign system, which is the one that appliesfoi- that time, Kalayukta began on 29 October, A.D, GOO, in Saka-sathvat 522 expired, and ended on 25 October, A.D, 601. In that period, the giventithi ended closely about 22 hours oSminntts after mean sunrise (for TJjjain) on Sunday, 13 November, A.D. COO, and cannot be connected with the Monday. And from tKis we see that thu case is not one in which the writer of the record obtained a correct date by calculation. 
As one means towards determiningthe real date of the record, we may cite some other notices of the Matura family, to which the record refers the MaMsaimntadhipati Santi varman. We have one mention of it in the Sravana-Belgola epitaphof the great Ganga prince Noi.ambantaka-Marasirh.ha (A.D. 963-64 to 974), which describes him as seizingthe possessions of the lord of the Vamwasi country, and causing him or those who belongto the Matura race to do obeisance to him (ante, vol. 5, p. 179). No personal name, however, is mentioned there. Some other notices of tte family,of ar specific nature, from other records in Mysore, are as follows : 
(I) An inscription a Hschche in the Sorab talufca, Shimoga District : Eyri. (7am., vol. 8,

Sb. 476. This record refers itself to the reignof the Rashtraknta king Krishna III, and is dated in the Vikarin samvatsara, Saka-samvat 861 (expired), with details fallingin December, A.D. 939. It tells us that the MaMsamantadhipati Machiga, Machideva, whom it describes as"lord of Trikundapura the best of towns "; born in the Matura race ; and having the Nandavana umbrella, the horse crest, and the mirror banner, was then rulingat Herdese :l the sphere of his government is not stated. 
(2) An inscription at Otnru iu the same talnka : ibid., Sb. 70. This record is not dated : but it refers itself to the same reign, and is therefore to be placed between A.D. 939 and 959. It tells ns that the Maltasamantadhipati Machiyarasa was then lord of the Banavasi twelve thousand. It describes him just as Machiga, Machideva, is desciibed in No. 1 above ;and he is plainly the same person. 
(3) An inscription at Kakkarasi in the same taluka : ibid., Sb. 474, This record refers itself to the same reign, and is dated in the Anaiida samvatsara, Saka-samvat 876 (expired), with details falling in October, A.D. 954. It tells na that the Mahasamantadhipati Machiyarasa described in the same terms as in Nbs. 1 and 2 above was then ruling over"the twelve thousand.''^ 
(4) Another inscription at Hechche : ibid., Sb. 479. This record refers itself to the reign of the Rashtrakuta king Kakka II, and consequently, thoughnot dated, may be referred to closely about A.D. 972. It tells us that the Malidsamanta Santivarman whom it describes as "lord of Trikundapurathe best of towns"; born in the Matura race; and having 
the Nandanavana umbrella,the horse crest, and the mirror banner was then rulingat Herdese. 
(5) Another inscription at Hechche : ibid., Sb. 477. This record refers itself to the reign of the Western Chalukya king Ahavamalla-Taila II, and is dated (withoutfull details) in the 
Khara samvatsara, Saka-samvat 913 (expired),= A.D. 991-92. It tellsus^thatthe Malia samantadhipati Santivarman described otherwise in just the same terms as in No. 4 above was then ruling the Belgnhe 70, the Edenad 70, the Tandavnra 12, the Gedeya 12, the Mugunda 12, the Pulivatti 12, the Kalvatti 7, and the Santalige1000. 
These other notices of the Matfira family agree with the palseographic evidence in placing the real date of the record in the tenth century A.D. And as a means towards deter mining its exact date we take the given samvatsara, Kalayukta.In the tenth century,this samvatsara came only once. By the southern lunisolar system, which is applicablefor this time to the locality to which the record belongs,it coincided with Saka-sarhvat 880 expired. And in this year the given details are correct for Monday, 15 November, A.D. 958, on which day the specified titU ended at about 17 hours 30 minutes after mean sunrise (for u jjaiu). This result satisfies the requirements of the case, both palteographic and historical. And we entertain no doubt that this is the real date on which the record was framed, and that the Santivarman mentioned in it is the Santivarman of the Hechche inscriptions Nos. 4 and 5 above. As to why the -writer of the record antedated it by practicallysix of the sixty-years cycles, we can only conjecture that the ban laid uponthe village had existed for some long time ;that it had been disregarded ;and that antedating (madeiu fact to a preposterous extent) was necessaryto legalize acts which had been performedin spite of it.

He may have been some juniorrceuiber of 4e family, perhaps holding office under Santivarman, But there is nothing iu the record to mark him as such.

Note on the Kanarese and Telugu initial short i. 
The alphabet exhibited in this Devngeri inscriptionis a specimen, belongingto the tenth century A.D., of that which Professor Biihler in his Indische Palacographie, 29, termed the Kanarese and Telugu alphabet.3 An interestingdetail in this particular record is that it presents the two types of the initial short i of this alphabet : we have the earlier type 
in irppatt-, line 2, and the later type in idam, line 20 : the latter is found also in idan=3at the beginning of line 18, but is much dmnaged there. And we have to consider the circumstances in which this mixture of the two types could occm*. I "had hoped to ^ive a sketch, with 
plates, of the full historyof the vowel in question, and at the same time of the initial long1 ; because, in addition to the interest that attaches to the study itself, thy types and forms of these two letters may at any time be found particularly instructive in respectof the proper placing of undated genuine records, and of fixing limits for the fabrication of some of the spurious records. For the present, however, it has been found impracticable to prepare the requisite plates ; chiefly in consequence of a want of published facsimiles for the crucial period when the earlier types were being supplanted bythe later ones. I must, therefore, confine my treatment of the matter to the history of the initial short i in the Kanarese and Telugu countries during the transitional period, and limit my remarks to such details as can bo made clear without more than half a dozen illustrations. 
The earlier type of the Kanarese and Telugu initial short i has been illustrated by Pro fessor Biihler in his plate VII, line 3, cols. XII, XIII, XV to XVIII, and plate VIII, line 3, cols. II to V. I give two other illustrations in the margin : A. is drawn from the i of ilntir rvorum, line 20, letter No. 13, in the Sirfir inscriptionof A.D. 866 from ^g the Dharwar District, Bombay, ante,vol. 7, p. 20G, plato: B. is fromp~\,-~ the i of irugatige, line 5, No. 22, in the Begnr inscription of the periodV.- o A.D. 908-38 from the Bangalore District, Mysore, ante, vol. 6, p. 48, plate. In this type, the character consisted, when fully made, of two parts, with various forms accordingto certain differences in the details of the two parts. The lower part consisted of two components, which were placed sometimes on the lower line of the writing, sometimes below it. These components, when made with uniformity, were sometimes two small circles, as in B., or two round marks whjch were not completelyclosed in as circles, and sometimes two dot?, as in A., which might be either round or of irregular shape. But sometimes, whether owing to caprice or carelessness of the writers, or to indifferent work bythe engravers,or to the material breaking away (especially in the case of records on stone) in the hands of the engravers, these details are met with interchanged, and we have a circle accompanied by a dot. And occasionally the components of

the lower part were omitted, aud the ends of the upper parb were then usually brought down to the lower line o the writing : for a publishedinstance of this,from. the eastern partsof Southern India, see iti, line 43, No. 17, irrula,line 66, No. 5, and itjiyuri, the same line, No. 14, in the Kaluchumbarru grantof the period A.D. 945-70, ante, vol. 7, p. 186, plate. In a quite exceptional instance of A.D. 982 from Mysore (see p.13 below)the lower partconsists of three circles, instead of two : this can only be regardedas a freak. The upper part sometimes took 
the form of a plain smooth arch, as in ittodu,line 2, No. 5, and ittodfin*,line 3, No, 11,in the inscription of the period A.D. 597-608 outside the Vaishnava cave No. 3 at Badami in the Bijapur District, Bombay, Archceol. Surv. West, India, vol. 1, p. 24, plate; Ind. Ant., vol. 10, p. 59, plate. But usually there was a more or less marked notch or, bend down, pointedor curved, in the centre of the top : we have this in its pointed form in the illustrations A. and B. given herewith; and more markedlyin iti, line 21, No. 12, in one of the early Kadamba copperplate records, Ind. Ant., vol. 6, p. 96, plate: in its curved form, which had the effect of giving a waving shape to the top stroke, we have it in iti, the last line, No. 9, in the Haidarabad plates 
of A.D. 612, ibid., p. 74, plate. And sometimes this notched form was made so flatly that it resembles rather closely the outspread wingsof a hovering bird: see, for instance (thoughthese cases do not come from the particularterritories with which we are concerned), Professor Biihler's plate VII, 3, IV, VI, VII, IX, and plate VIII, 3,1. The upper partis usually found single, formed by one continuous sweeping movement : but in some cases it has a disjointed appearance,with a break in the middle, aa if it was made by two separate strokes,as in idam=, line 9, No. 17, in the Nerur platesof the period A.D. 609-42 from the Sawautwadi State, Bombay, Ind, Ant., vol. 8, p. 44, plate, and in iva,line 42, No. 9, from the end, idam,line 56, No. 9 from the end, and i$igu-r=, Ime 82, No. 10 from the end, in the Kadaba plates from the Tumknr District, Mysore, which hear a date in A.D. 812 or 813,Ind. Ant., vol. 12, p. 14, plate: Epi. Qarn,, vol. 12, Gb. 61, plate: as, however, this feature is onlynoticed in records ou copper, it is evidently to be attributed to the processof engraving,not to the writers. The sides of the upper part were not alwaysof equal lengbh. And sometimes the left side is curled in much more than the right side; as, for instance, in the cases mentioned above from the Haidarabad and 
a(J.aba plates, and, in fact, in the Devageri inscriptionitself. Sometimes both the sides were well curled in, as in the illustrations A. and B. above, and more markedly in iridu, line 4, No. 1, and ivu, line 5, No. 1, in the Hatti-Mattur inscriptionof about A.D. 765, ante, vol. 6, p. 162, plate ; so also in an instance from the eastern partsof Southern India, in iti, line 85, No. 7 from the end, in the Ranastipundi grant of A.D. 1019, ante, vol. 6, p, 357, plate. Occasionally, the rijrht side was continued downwards in a slanting direction to, or towards, between the two components of the lower part: one instance of this is found in idam* (for imam-), Hue 13, No. 40, in the Mahakuta pillar inscription of A.D. 602, Ind. Ant., vol. 19, p, 18, plate: another is Professor Buhler's plate VII, 3, XVIII, which is from the ity=in line 13, No. 11,of the Eastern Ohalukya record of A.D. 668, Ind. Ant,, vol. 7, p, 186, with platein vol. &, p. 820. Aud sometimes the right side was continued down into the right component of the lower part : this was a transitional form, which will be noticed below. 
The later type of the Kanarese and Telugn initial short i has been illustrated by Professor Biibler in his plate VIII, line 3, cols. VI, VIII, IX. I givethree other illustrations in the margin : C. from ittham=, line 22, No. 2 from the end, in the (?) Masulipatam plates or Aknlamannandu grant of the period A.D, 934-45 (see p.15 below) : D. is drawn from the

customarily formed, did not consist of separate parts, but was made in one unbroken whole by a continuous sweeping movement of the reed or stilus. Bat, as witli (he earlier type, the topis occasionally found in a disjointed shape,as a result of the process of engraving: for instance, ia itah, Line 79, No. 4, in the Chellfir plates of A.D. 1143, Ind. Ant., vol. 14, p. 59, plate. And the top part irfUhe instance figured as C. above was evidently made by the writer by two strokes instead of one continuous movement. The top of the letter in this typeis the upper part of the earlier type, in its notched form : but a very exceptional form ia occasionally found in records from the eastern side of. Southern India, in which the character beginswith a curl down towards the left, instead of the curl up to the right: Bee, for instance, iti, line 102, the last dkshara bat one, in the Teld platesof A.D. 1086-87, UHU, vol. 6, *p. 343, plate. The remainder of it was made by continuing the rightside of the top downwards, and then in a loop upwards to the left and turningto the rightto meet the down-stroke ; and it was finished oU by a projection taken to the right and turned down into a sort of tail : in some cases, how ever, this projection to the rightis very rudimentary, as, indeed, in the illustration E. ;and in others, of the transitional class (see below),it does not appear at all. 
The method of the transition from the earlier to the later type can be easily recognized though an intervening link or two may be wanting. Tho first step was a continuation of the right Bide of the upper partof the earlier type down to touch the right component of! the lower part : I give an instance of this, in the illustration 3P. in the margin, from an 
Eastern Chalukya record, the Trandaparu, grant,of the period A, 0,844 88 (see p, 15 below). The nest step was to form the right componentof thejf lower part, not by an entirely separate movement after raisingthe reed or stilus, but by an unbroken continuation of the down-stroke : we have an instance of this, with the right lower component formed by a continuation o that movement to the left, in Professor Buhler's plate VIII, 3, IT, which is from the i of int-app-atin line 13, No. 4 from the end,in the Kanarese record of Govinda III of A.D. 804, Ind. Ant., vol. 11, p. 137, plate.1 It must, however, have become customary, in this continuous formation of the right lower component,to make the movement to the right, instead of the left. The nest step probably was to make the entire letter by one continuous stroke, without any lifting of the reed or stilus, in the Q H 
manner suggested in illustration G. givenin the margin, with the two ^circles of the lower part runninginto each other. In the cursive ^j (J movement thus set up, a subsequent step certainly was to make one large ^ _ loop serve the purpose of the two circles, as in illustration H. : we have instances oE this in 
fv-fira (for^ra), line 12, No. 7, and i (for i) dawnwan*, line IB, the last ^^ara m the inscription of A.D. 1047-43 at Mindigaiin the Kslar District, Mysore, ante, vol. 5, p. 207, plate It seems to have been then recognizedthat a coafasion was liable to arise between the uuLial short t and the initial ai of the same alphabet: and it mast have b.en in order to avoid suoh the vowel IB fouuT^s'oT^ (for *fe*),line 12-13 , but it doea not preamtthe ea.e

confusion tlmt there was added the projectingtail to the right, which produced the form illustrated in C., D., and B. above. 
Professor Biihler'a latest instances of the earlier type are as follows. As noted is* the preceding paragraph, Ms plate VIII, 3, II,is an i of A.D, 804, and is really a transitional form. His plate VIII, 3, III, is from the record on the Kadaba plates from Mysore, bearinga date in A.D. 812 or 813 : the vowel is found fourteen times in this record : the instancefigured seems to be from iva, line 15, No. 23 (sideii a, line 1), Ind. Ant.,vol. 12, p. 14, plate; Epi. Cft--rn., vol. 12 (Tnmknr), Grb, 61, plate. His remaining two illustrations are from the eastern pa,i*tn of Southern India. The later of them, plate VIII, 3, V, is entered as if it was taken from the copper plate record which gives the date of the coronation of Amma II in A.P. 945, Ind. Ant., vol. 7, p. 15, plates ; but that record does not include any initial i;and the illustration seems to have been supplied from ih*aijate, line 40, "No. 7 (sideiii 6, last line), in the*Paganavaram' plat OH or Diggubarru grant of the period A.D. 834-45a Ind* Ant., vol. 13, p. 214, plate. On thu otlKT side, his earliest instance of the later type is plate VIII, 3, VI : it is from the eastern pa<vtof Southern India, from the copperplate record which gives the date of the anointment of RiVjarfija( in AJD. 1022, and may be of any date from that year up to about A.D. 1063 ; and it ap jK-'UI'H to be the -i of iti, line 11, No. 5, Ind. Ant., vol. 14, p. 50, plate. There is thus a gap in tho history of the Kanarese and Telngu initial short i, of roughlya century, from A.D. 9 *.> t- ir> to 1022-63, to be extended, in fact, aa regardsthe Kanarese country,to even two centurion, in respect of which we have, so far, no information. We have now to see how this gap csioa. bo bridged over. It was chiefly due, as far as Professor Biihler was concerned, to a Uujk of materials in the shape of published facsimiles. The same want still exists to almost the **SIHU extent. Bat we can now cite various facsimiles which have been publishedfiinco his time : uncl I can supplement them by ink-impressions which necessarily were not available to him. 
We will consider first such materials as are available from the Kanareso districts of tho Bombay Presidency; takingthe matter up from the earliest instance, known to me, utVr Professor Biihler's latest instance of the earlier type. Here I use only records whiohi ro specifically dated ; and, when I cannot refer to a published plate, I cite my details from iiik impressions which were prepared under my direction when I waa in the districts in quedtioju . From these parts, we still have the earlier type of the initial short i ninniug Ihrou j:?b tlu records of the time of tlie Rashtraktita king Amaghavarsha I. We have it in the Nil Kum} inscription, dated in A.D, 866, from the Gadag taluka, Dharwar; ante, vol. 6, p. 10L}, pJute; it iti, line 6, No. 17 : it occurs also in idan= towards the end of line 28, to which part .,f thi> record, however, the plate does not extend. We have it again in the Sir Qr inscription o tlw same date, from the Nawalgund taluka, Dharwarj ante, vol. 7, p. 206 plate in iti No. 6, and ilnHrvwrum, line 20, No. 13 1 the illustration A, onp. 7 above is from the instance.

have it in an unpublished inscription, dated in A.D. 897-98, at the village CMnchli mentioned above ;in ititline 7, and idam, lines 14 and 17, 
On the other hand, we have the later type in an unpublished fragmentary inscriptionof the same reign, of Krishna II, dated in A.D. 901-2, at Yeli-Sirur in the Gadag taluka, Dharwar ; in irppatta, line 1 : here the precise form is a lop-sided one, very much like that which we have in ity=3line 41, No. 12, in the Teki plates of A.D. 1086-87 from the eastern side of Southern India, ante, vol. 6, p. 339, plate. And the later typeis found againin the Nandwadige inscrip tion of the same reign, dated in A.D. 903, from the Hnngund tahika, Brjapur ;Ind. Ant,, voL 12, p. 221, with plate in vol. 11, p. 127; in irppatt-,lino 2, No, I. These two cases are the earliest instances of the later type that I can cite from either the western or the eastern parts of Southern India ; but they are run close byan instance of A.D. 909-10 from the Kolar District, Mysore (see p. 12 below). 
The nest record takes us back to the earlier type : it is the Hatti-Mattnr inscriptionof the time of ludra III, dated in A.D. 916-17, from the Karajgi taluka, Dharwar;Ind. Ant., vol. 12, p. 224 (no plate) : here we have the earlier typo, in a thoroughlyarchaic form, in idam, line 10, and i (for 1} stitiyan-, line 11. Regardingthe second inscription on the same stone, sec lower

The others are records of the time of Krishna III. Here we have the later typein the unpublished inscription, dated in A.D. 942, at Ran, Dharwar District, noticed in Ind.

On the other hand, the earlier type is presented againin the unpublishedChinchli inscription of the same reign, dated in A.D. 953, from the Gadag taluka, Dharwar, noticed ante, vol. 6, p. 83;in idarke or ivarke, line 29. 
We next have the later type againin the unpublished inscriptionof A.D. 967, 970, or 971, of the time o Khottiga, at Hire-HandigOlin the Gadag taluka, Dharwar, noticed ante, vol. 6, p.180 ;in int=appavam, line 20. 
But the earlier type appears againin an unpublished inscriptionof the same reign, dated in A.D. 989, at Nagavi in the same taluka, noticed ante, vol. C, p. 180, and Dyn. Kan. Distrs., p. 422, note 3;in ivarke or idarke in the last line but five. 
For the time of the last Riashtrakuta king, Kakka IT, I cannot cite anyinstance of the use of this initial vowel. The next available record is one in which we find the two types mixed, iuBt as in the Devageri inscription.It is the inscriptionof A.D. 976 from Hebbal, in the Lakahmeahwar subdivision of the MirajState within the limits of tho Dharwar District; ante, vol. 4, p.351 (no plate) : here we have the later typein irppattu,line 35^ but in int=ly=ayvar=, line 38 we have the earlier type, with the sides of the top brought down to the lower line of the writing, and with omission of the two circles or dots of the lower partof the letter.1 And we may note that we have the same mixture of types in the undated inscription which lies* below the Hatti-Mattur record of A.D. 916-17 (mentioned above) from the Karajgi taluka, Dharwar; Ind.

cite of the use of the earlier typeof the initial i in the Kanareae districts of Bombay. The nex available records all show the folly developedlater type. The first is the unpublished 
inscription of the time of the Western Chalukya kingTaila II, dated in A.D. 880, at Sogal mUParasgad taluka, Belgaum, mentioned in Dyn. Kan. Dwiw., p. 428 : here we have the vowel i n i (for ) dtomroaiiwm-, line 2 from the end, The next is the inscription of the same reiT", dated six months later in the same year, at Saundatfci, the head-quartersof the Parasgad taha-ki^; Jour.

The next is the unpublished inscriptionof the time <-t Irivabedanga-SatyaSraya, dated in A.D, 1002, at Gadag, the head-q-nartereof the Gadag taluk", Dharwar, mentioned in Intl. Ant.,vol. 2, p. 297, No. 3 (where the date has teen wrongly show n as Saka-samvat 984, instead of 924.); here we have the vowel in wii=foarw, line 6 from tli end. It seems unnecessary to pursuethe matter beyond this point; in every other instance from the Bombay districts, "known to me, only the later typeis found. 
We now take the matter upfor Mysore and Coorg; starting, again, with the earlit* nt instance, known to me, after Professor Buhler'a latest instance of the earlier type, and lining chieny records which are specifically dated, but also a few which can be distinctly referred to well-ascertained periods. Here, when I cannot pointto published plates,I cite my detaila from ink-impressions for -which I am indebted to Professor Hultzsch and Mr. H. Krishna Sastri .

This is the earliest instance but two, known to me, of the occurrence of the later type : the earlier instances are those of A.D. 901-2 and 903 from the Dharwiir and Bijapnr Districts, Bombay, mentioned on p. 11 above. If this instance came from the north of Mysore,it would be quite intelligible. But ifc comes from a part where we do not trace the later type againtill A.D. 1029-30, and where we find indications of a transitional position even after that time (see p.14 below). It is therefore peculiar, And we can only regardit as intrusive, and conjecture that the writer of this record was not a local man, but came from some territory where the later type of the vowel was well established. The explanationis perhapsto be found in the fact that the record, which conies from the Bairaknr hftbli in the north-east quarter of the Mulbagal talaka, near the boundary of the North Arcot District, Madras, is a Bana record : we know that the territory of the Bana princesof this period extended at least well into North Arcot. 
We are taken back to the earlier type by the nest available record, an inscriptionof the time of the Kashtrakfita king GOvinda IV, dated in A.D. 030-31, at Nandigudi in the Chitaldroog District; Epi. Cam., vol. 11, Dg. 119, plate; here we have the vowel in idem*, line 8, No. 9. We have it againin an inscription dated in A.D. 942 at Hemavatl in the Anantapur District; Epi. Oar/i., vol. 12, Si. 28 ]l in iriva, line 29, and int-ivar, line 53. And 
again in an inscription dated in A.D. 944-45 ab Betaraangalain the Ko"lar District; Epi. Qarn,, vol. 10, Bp. 2 (no plate) ; in idan=, line 12 : here the componentsof the lower partof the letter were perhaps omitted. 
The next record comes from the northern partof Mysore, and gives us a second instance of the later type; namely, an inscription dated in A.D. 961-62 on the Jattinga-Eamesvarahill in the Chitaldroo^ District; Epi. Cam., vol. 11, Mk. 27, with plate at texts, p. 142: here we have the vowel in idara, line 5, No. 1. 
In the south, however, we have the earlier type againin the epitaphof the Ganga prince Nolambantaka-Mfirasiriiha, framed in A.D. 975, at Sravana-Belgolaiu the Hassan District ; ante, vol. 5, p. 178, plate ;in ity=,line 50, No. 1, and intu, line 100, No. 1 : here, in both cases, both the sides of the upper partof the letter were continued down to the componentsof the lower part. We have it againin the Peggu-fir inscription dated in A.D. 978, from Ooorg ;Ind. Ant,, vol. 6, p. 102, No, 1, plate; Epi. Cam., vol. 1, p. 7, plate;in idan=, line 18, No. 1. And ao'ain in the Sravana-Belgola epitaphof the Rashtraknta prince Indra IV, dated in A.D. 982, from the Hassan District; Epi. Oarn., vol. 2, p. 53 (no plate);in iriyalJs=, north face line 15, and irade, south face, line 31 : here in the first case, the lower component consists qnite exceptionally, of three (instead of two) circles,2 
I cannot cite any use of the earlier typein Mysoreafter that date. From about half-way down the western side of the province, we have the fully developedlater type in the Chikmngalfir inscription, which belongsto the period A,D. 9891005, from the Kadnr District; ante, vol. 8, p.58 (no plate) ; Epi. Cam., vol. 6, Cm. 3 (no plate: I cite the form from the photograph from "which I edited the record) ;in innuru (for innufu,),line 9, in int=war= and i (for z) kodanyeyam, line 12, and in indavurada, line 16. And the nezt two citable records from the northern parts (beyond which we need not pursuethe matler for that locality) present the same type. One is an inscriptionof the time of the Western Chalukya king^JayafiimhaII, dated in A.D. 1035, at Belagiirniin the Shimoga District; Epi, Cam,, vol. 7, Sk. 126, plate; eee more clearly, the photographin Pali, Sanskrit, and Old- Canarese Inscriptions, No. 155 : here we have the vowel in i?ht=i} line 23, No. 5, and in infci, line 32, No. 4.

The northernparts of Mysore, however,the Shiraoga and Chitaldroog Districts, were subjectedto progressive influences, first under the Raahtrakftta kings and then under the Western Chalukyas, which did not penetrate much beyondthem. In the south, I trace the later type again,for the first time after A.D. 909-10 (p. 12 above),in the Chola inscription, dated in A.D. 1029-30, at SQladevaoaballi in the Bangalore District; Epi. Cam, vol. 9, HI. 1, with plateat translations, p.28;in idarkke,line 14, No. 11 ; here the letter is formed in a very exceptional manner;the end of it is curled over inside the down-stroke on theright, instead of being carried on to that stroke or across it into the usual tail, We perhaps have the later type, fully formed,in the Chola inscription, dated in A.D. 1032 (see ante,vol. 4, p. 69;,at Suttnru in the MysoreDistrict; JBpi, Cam., vol. 3, Nj. 164 (no plate): here, in the last line, we seem to have either dese^akliklimduga,corrected into dese iklikhandvigu,, or else deso iMikhanduga, corrected into deseii=akhkh<induqal for deselu=ikh'khcknduqa. And we certainly have a form of tf i * {y tf< i/** 
toe later typein the Chola inscription, dated in A.D, 1047-48, at Mindigalin the Kclar District; ante,vol. 5, p, 207, plate; Jityi. Oarn.,vol. 10, Ct. 30 (no plate);intj/=jra (for ty=wa), line 12, No. 7f and in i (for 1) dammman, line 16, the last dshara : here,in both cases, the form is practicallyidentical with that which I have givenas a transitional form in the illustration H. onp.9 above;the loopof the lower part stops short at the down-stroke on the right, instead of beingcarried across that stroke and on to form the usual tail. These two instances of A.D. 1029-30 and 104748 are suggestivethat for an appreciable time after A.D. 982 the letter was still in a transitional stage in the southern and south-eastern 
parts, and 'that, when more materials are available, we mayfind the earlier typestill in use there upto about A.D. 1000. Good specimensof the later type in its full form, from the southern partof the province, maybe seen in two records, dated in A.D. 1117, from Belflr in the Hassan District ; JBpi Oarn., vol. 5, Bl. 58, plate ;in ity=ato}line 2, No. 7 from, theend, and in inan=,line 13, No. 57 : and ibid., Bl. 71, plate ;in ity^ato,line 10, No, 6. But it was, of course, well established everywhere longbefore that time. 
Coming now to sum up the inquiry, we find the positionto be as follows. In the Kanarese districts of Bombay, we have the earlier typeof the .initial short * still in use up to at least A.D. 975. But the later type figuies freely along with it from. A,D. 901-2. For this partof the country, then, we may consider that the tenth century was a transitional period of usage, when the later type, thoughwell established, had notyet supersededthe earlier one, but both of them were accepted on equalterms. And in these circumstances we feel no surpriseat finding the two types occasionally used togetherin one and the same record ; in the Devageri inscription, which we refer to A.D. 958;in the Hebbalinscription, which is <lated in A.D. 975;and in the undated inscriptionat Hatti-Mattfir, As regards Mysore, with Coorg, we must separate the northern parts from the southern, In the north, the case was probably muoh the same as in the Bombay districts, though we have not, so far, actually traced the later typethere before A.D, 961-62. And?as we find the later type half-way down the western side of the province between A.D. 989 and 1005, we may expect" to meet with it anywhere from about A.D, 1000, In the south, however, the change was plainly slowsr, We have not, indeed, actually traced the use of the earlier type there after A,D. 982. But the later typeis found there onlyonce before that time;in an instance of A.D. 939-10 V7hich we can only regardas intrusive. And the records of A.D. 1029-30 and 1G-1M8 suggestthat the commencement of the period of trausitional usage in the south ;;ii hardly be placed

much, if at all before A.D. 875, and that we may jet meet with instances of tie earlier tri* there running well into the eleventh century. 
We torn now to the eastern parts of Southern India, taking the matter up from the record of the Eastern Chalukya kings, in which series, again, we now have available various inscription, presenting the vowel in question and covering the period in which we are interested, which werv not known to Professor Buhler.i There are two recorda of this aeriea which I have not been able to examine: namely, the Edern plates or Gontiim grant of Amma I, of the peri-d A.D. 918-25, South-Ind. Inscrs., vol. 1, p. 39 (no plate), where we have the vowel twice,in li ct. 8 38, 54;and the Nandamapnndi grant of Kajaraja I, dated in his thirty-second year,A.D. 1053- 54, ante, vol. 4, p. 303 (no plate): here the vowel occurs twelve times, in lines 10, 55, 72, 7.', 8087. Setting them aside, from an examination, either in the published plates or in ink impressions, of all the other records of the whole series down to A,D. 1143, I find the position to be as follows : 
The record on the (?) Masulipatam plates, the Trandaparn grant, of Vijayaditja III, of thp period AJ>. 844-88, $pi. Ind., vol. 5, p. 123, with plate showing lines 1 to 15 and 20 to 3o, contains the vowel twice, in iUliam-, line 18, and iva, line 35, and presents it in both cases in thv earlier type, but in the transitional form, with the right side of the upper part continued dov n 
to touch the right componentof the lower part. The published facsimile does not include tlKse two passages.I have giventhis form, from iva, line 35, as illustration J. on p. 9 above. The earliest instance of the later type from this partof Southern India3is found in thu record on the (?) Masulipatam plates, the Aknlamannandu grant, of Ohalukya-Bhlma II, of the period A,D. 934-45, ante, vol. 5, p. 135, with a plate showing Hoes 1 to S and 17 to 25 , in this record the vowel occurs only once, in itkham*,line 22, the last akshara, bat one, given as illustra tion C, on p.8 above : the upper partof ifc was plainly forme! by two separatestrokes instead of one continuous movement. The other records of the same period show the earlier type : the Diggubarr.u grant on the' Paganavaram' plates, Ind. Ant., vol. 13, p. 213, with plates, has it three times, in lines 15 and 40 (see note 1 on this page) ; the Kodhatalli grant on the Kolavennu plates, Soutli-lnd. Insets., vol. 1, p.44 (no plates), also gives it three times, in indur=, line 19, it~ham= (for ittham=>\line 22, and iti, line 23 ;and in the instance in line 23 the components of the lower partof the letter were omitted, and the ends of the npper part were brought down to the bottom line of the writing.3 
Tho records of the nest period, the reignof Vijayaditya-Amma II, A.D. 945-70, shew only the earlier type, as follows :4 The Masulipatam plates or Pambajju grant, ante, vol. 5, p 140, with a plate showinglines 1 to 8, and 17 to 24 : once, in indart-,line 25, the last but two.5 The Elavar.ru grant, Ind.

This is the latest instance of the use of the earlier type that I can cite from either the eastern or the western parrsof Southern India. In the Kastorn Chalukya series, the next records are two of the time of BajarajaI; and the order of them perhaps remains to be determined according to what we may leara from one of them about the use of this vowel. One is the Korumelli grant, Ind. Ant., vol. 14, p, 50, with plates, which gives the date of the king's anointmont, in A.D. 1022, and may possibly datn from that year itself : it presents the later type of the TOwe], six times, in lines 11, 47, 50, 56, 63, 103. The other is the Nandamapundi grant, ante, vol. 4, p. 303 (no plate"), which also mentions the date of the anointment, but is itself dated in the thii'ty-second year of the reign, A.D. 1053-54 ; it lins the vowel twelve times, in lines 10, 55, 72, 75, 8)-87 ; and, as mentioned on p, J5 above, it remains to be examined in respect of the type which ib presents.

The existence of these plntes was made public by the late Mr. A. M. T. Jackson, I.C.S., IE the Indian Antiquary, Vol. XXXIX. p. 129, N"o. I. They belong to tha State of Palitana in Kathiavar and are reported to have been unearthed in the city of Palitana some forty years ago. "When first discovered, theyxverii fastened together with six Maitraka grants by a single Valabhl 
seal and suspended by it from the roof of a small underground chamber -adjoining a tank under neath a large stone. I edit the inscription on them from t\vo sets of ink-impressions, prepared by Dr. Vogel's clerk and placed at my disposal by Kai Bahadur Venkayya, to whom Mr. W. C. Tudor Owen, I.C.S., Administrator of Palitana, had kindlylent the originals. 
These are two copper-plates, measuring, according to Mr. Yenkayya, about 9| inches in breadth and varying between 7j and 7 inches in height. Each of the two plates bears on its inner side 14 lines of well-preserved writing. The letters show through on the back of the plates, especially of the second one. There are two ring-holes at the bottom of the Grsfc and at the top of the second plate, but no ringor seal is forthcoming, 
The alphabet is of an early Southern type and includes the signs of jihv&muliya (11. 2, 17) and of u<padhm&niya (11. 9, 19, 23, 27) and final forma of t (1. 25) and of n (1. 4). The date (1. 27) is expressed in numerical symbols.

The inscription records a grantof land, made by the Samanta-Maharaju, Simhaditya (I. 17) of the Garulaka family (1. 2) This order was issued from a place named Phafikaprasravana (1. 1). The d>nee w.isa Brahmana of the Maitrayauika school who lived at Elapadra (1. 20 f). The object of the grant was a field with a pond in the village Darbbachara (1. 21 f). lam unable to identify Phankaprasravaua and Darbhachara. Elapadra,as Dr. Fleet suggests to me, may be ' Velwad ' in the Godhra taluka, Panch Mahals. 
The date of the grant was the 13th tithi of the bright fortnightof the month Asvayirjain the year 255 (1. 27) of an era which is not specified, but which, aa suggested by Mr. Jaokson, is probably the Gupta-Valabhiera of A.D. 319. The specified mouth, then, places the record inA.D 574. 
As stated by Mr. Jackson, the Garulaka familyif) a hitherto unknown dynasty of feudatory chiefs who may be assumed to have been tributaries (samantd) of the Maitraka kings. The Garalaka Simhaditya was a contemporaryof Dharasena II. of Valabhi. The name Garulaka seems to stand for Q&rulaka or Ganidaka and suggests that this family claimed descent from Vishnu's bird Garuda. The inscription contains the following pedigreeof the donor : 
Senapati Varahadasa (I.). 
S&ma,nta-Ma,h&ra}a Bhattisiira. S&nKLnta-Mah&raja VaraliadSsa (II.). 
S&manta-Mah&r&ja Simhaditya (A.T). 574). 
Each of these four chiefs is praisedin purely conventional terms. The only item of inform ation which may be based on a historical fact, is the statement (1. 11 f.) that Varahadasa II. defeated a ruler of Dvaraka (on the west coast of Kathiavar), whose individual name is not recorded.

Ho, 3. SAHETH-MAHETH PLATE OF GOVINDACHANDRA; [VIKRAMA-] SAMVAT llt>6. 
By PANDIT DAYA HAM SAHNI, M.A. 
Br. Vogel has already announced, the discoveryof this copper-plate inscriptionin two articles. One of theae appearedin the Pioneer of the llth May, 1908, under the title of "Sravasti and its remains"and contains all the salient points in tho history of this ancient city, derivable from the Pali tests and the writingsof modern explorers. It winds up with the statement that the present inscription conclusivelysettles tt^ identification of Saheth and Maheth on the borders of the Gonda and Bahraich districts with the Jetavana and Sravastf, respectively, of Buddhist literature. The connection of the copper-plate with Jetavana and Sravasti is expressed in the most unmistakable languagein the inscription engraved on it, and since the plate haa been found carefully depositedin a cell of a large monasteryat Saheth, it was obviously intended for it, Mr, V. A. Smith, however, while referringto the platein a footnote on page 792 of the Journal ojthe EayalAsiatic Societyfor July 1908, has expressedthe opinion that the plate may have been broughtto Saheth from the real Sravaati which he locates somo where near Balapur in Nepal Tarai, not far from the place where the Raptileaves the hills. 
The evidence in favour of the identification of Saheth-Maheth with Sravasti is set forth by Mr. Marshall in the Journal ofthe RoyalAsiatic Society* and here it is enough to enumerate the main facts. Foremost of theae is the remarkable agreementwhich exists between the topography of the remains at Saheth-Maheth and the descriptionsof Sravaati recorded bythe Chinese pilgrims. We nest come to the well-known colossal bodhisattva discovered by General Cunningham on this site, which accordingto the Kushana inscription on its pedestal was set up at Sravasti. A fragmentof its umbrella post (danda) with the same inscription as that on the bddhisattva has recently been broughtto light by Dr. Yogel. It is now in the Lucknow Museum, bat is believed originallyto have been unearthed at Saheth byDr. Eoey. Then there is the inscribed copper-platewhich, forms the subjectof this paper. And last of all we have the lower half of a life-size statue of ft bodkisattva which was discovered by Mr. Marshall at Saheth Maheth in the year 1908-09. The pedestal of this statue bears an early Kuahaca inscription which states that it was presented by certain Kshatriyabrothers at the Jetavana of Sravasti. In the face of all this evidence it would be strange, indeed,if the identification of SahSth-Mabeth. remained doubtf al, merelybecause the statements of the Chinese pilgrims about the location of Sravaeti are somewhat incorrect. 
The plate was discovered by me in a monastery (No. 21, map of Saheth, Dr. Hoey'e Report3) on the site of Saheth in the springof 1908 when I was assisting Dr. Yogel in his excavations

No. 3.] SAHETH-MAHETE PLATE OF GOVINDACHATORA, 21   
1;bere, This building Tvas partially excavated by Dr. Hoey, and it was here that, on breaking through the paved courtyard, he found the inscribed slab publishedin the Ind. Ant. Vol. XVII, p.61 ff. 1 Dr. Hoey also openedout seven out of the fcvrenty-fourcells which surround the courtyard in the centre and it was in one of these, namely,the one adjoiningthe entrance chamber on the south, that the copper-plate under reference was found. It was carefully packed in an earthen box, 2 feet square and 3 inches high externally, closed with a lid of the same material, the space between the plate and the receptacle beingfilled with clay. The box was built against the foundation of the northern wall of the cell referred to, just below the floor, well secured to the wall by means of brickwork on all sides. 
The plate measures 18" by14" and is \" thick. In the centre of tha upper part there is a ring-hole |" in diameter. The ring was not found,nor the seal which must have surmounted ifc.3 The plfite is inscribed on one side only and contains 27 lines of writing in a perfectstate of preser vation, The characters are Nagari and the language Sanskrit throughout. Inrespecbof ortho graphy, the following points may be noted. The letter 6 is denoted bythe signfor v throughout. The doubling of consonants before and after r occurs in lines 4 (twice), 5, 16 (twice), 17, 18 (twice), 19 (twice), 22 (twice), 23, 24 (thrice), and 27. The horizontal topstroke (matr&) which elsewhere distinguishes the letters v and I from dh and , respectively, is, in a few cases, also found in the latter. Omissions of letters are supplied bythe insertion of the corresponding signs immediately above or below their original places: c/. ra in Turashku, in line 21 and bha in. bhadrasanam in line 23. A rough figureof Garuda is engraved once at the end of the llth line and again in the last line before the words mamgalam maha-tirih. 
The inscription begins,like all the other epigraphsof the Gahadavala kingGflvindachandra that have so far come to light, with nine verses in different metres containinghis genealogy, and ends with seven benedictive and imprecatoryverses and an eighth which supplies the name of the engraver. The formal portion is contained in the rest of the epigraph and is, as usual, in. prose.I have given the full text "of the inscription, but omitted from the translation the first nine verses, because theyare paraphrasedin the prose passage following them, and the next seven which contain the usual admonitions to future kings. The taxes specified (line 21) as due to the donees are the bhagabhdgdkara,the pravanikara, and the Turushkadanda? The last named tax figures onlyin the records of three other kingsof the Gahadavala dynasty, namely, the Chandravati plateof Govindachandra's grandfather, Chandradeva j4 the inscription issued by Gfivindacbandra himself on behalf of his father Madanapala;6 and a plateof Vijayachandra and the Yuvaraja Jayachchandra.6 
In respect of the localities mentioned in the record, it is gratifyingto note .that spme of them can be identified beyond all possibility of doubt. The other places have, in all probability, gone out of existence. One of these latter is VihSra, the first of the six villages granted. It is said to have been situated iu the district of what appearsto be Vada-chaturaSrti.7 There is a comparatively large village called Baja Jot or the Holy Baja, about 2 miles west of Saheth. I am inclined to think that Vada may possibly be a mistake for Baja. The next village Pattana is situated about 3 miles south-west of Saheth or about 2 miles south of 
i [It is worthy of note that the slab was found"in a stratum which indicated that it had been placed in a restored building ;" see also the following note. Ed.] 
s[The absence of the ring and seal would show that the plate must have had a history of its own before it came to be deposited at the spot where it baa now been discovered. Ed.]

Katra on the road leadingto Khargupur Bazar and ia now called Patnii. There is a mass of ancient remains near the village and tlie peasants have discovered a few old wells which they use for the irrigation of their fields. The villageof Upalaimda I cannot identify, The fourth village is called Vavvahali in the plate. This is presumably now represented by Belaha 
situated near the village of Patiia. The villagers saythat it is ancient. The nest place is "Gbosadi attached to Meyi." Ghasadi does not exist;but Meyi is still an important village neat Subhagpur on the Gonda-Iutiathok road. The last village is"Payasi belonging (so Fothivara." This I identify with a village of the name of Bayasi which formerlystood 2 kBs to north-east of Saheth-Maheth, but was washed away bythe Eapti some years ago. Its site is stil] known by the name of Bayasi. 
[In line 19 f. the Buddhist ascetic Sakyarakshita is said to have been a native of Utkala i.e. Orissa, and hia disciple Vaglsvararakshita belongedto the Choda country. The date of the inscription, vis, Vikrama-Saravat Iiy63 correspondsto A.D. 1128-9, which falls into the reign, of the Chola king Vikrama-Chola. The Grahadavala kingsof Kanauj appear to have been ou friendly terms with the Cholas of Tanjorc1 whose dominions extended into the Northern Cirours during the reignsof Kulottunga I. and Vikrama-Chola. It is not certaiu if Yagisvararakshita came from the Tamil countryor from the vicinityof Amaravati which TV as included in the dominions of the Chofa king at the time. We know verylittle of the history of Buddhism ia the Tamil country. But there ia no doubt that there were adherents of that creed down to the 13th century A,D. in the country round Amaravati in the Guntur District. Besides, Kumaradevi, the Baddhist queen of Gsvindaehandra, was the daughter of a chief of Pithi. And Dr. Konow saysit is possibleto identify Pithi with Pithapuram in the modern Godavari District of the Madras Presidency.2 If this be the case,it is no matter for surprise that the two Buddhist ascetics who pleased Govindachandra were natives of Orissa and the Chodfi country. Probably they were introduced to the king by his queen Kumaradevi, who probably brought about, either directly or indirectly, the gift recorded in the subjoined inscription. The sentence punar api sasaiakrityct grama ime shad api datta, "these six villages were given again bya charter" implies that these villages bad originally been granted to the Buddhist vihsra at Jetavana, but, for some reason or other, resumed subsequently. At Sarnath, queen Kumaradevi restored the "lord of the turningof the wheel" and erected a vilfSrc, for his accommodation. It is not impossiblethat the same queen also infused fresh life into the Buddhist establishment at Jetavanu by sending for the two Buddhist ascetics and inducing the king to restore the six villages which once belongedto the vihdra, Ed.]

No. 4.-THE CHAHAMANAS OF MARWAR, 
BY D. R. BHANDARKAR, M.A.; POONA. 
In his paper on"The Chahamanas of Naddiila!>the late Professor Kielhorn has edited the Sundha hill inscription of Chachigadeva3 which helpsto determine the order of succession and the relationship of the various princes, whose inscriptions had been published, but whose con nection with one another had long remained unknown. We are now aware that they were all of the Chahamana dynasty. But there were several families of the Chahamanas that reigned iu Bajputana, It was, therefore, necessaryto distinguish the line that ruled over Marwar from other branches ruling elsewhere. And Professor Kielhorn chose to group them together under the title "the Chahamanas of Naddula." But some of these Chahamanas reigned at Naddiila (Hadol), and some at Jabalipura (Jalor). Strictly speaking, they should, therefore, have been called "the Chahamanas of Naddiila and Jabalipura." The descendants of the former are called Nadolias, and of the latter Souagaras. Again,at Sancbor, inscriptions are found of a Chahamana prince who seeins to be neither a Nadslia nor a Sonagara,, but rather a SanchOra, another subdivision of the Chohans. Under such circumstances, it is best to designate these OhOhana as "the Chahamanas of Marwar," 
The subjoined inscriptions were discovered during the two tours undertaken by me in 1907-08 and 1908-09 in the southern and south-eastern partsof Marwar, and this paperis really a supplement to that of Professor Kielhorn, without which it would not have been possible to make my article interesting. 
I AND IL SADAPI AND NADOL INSCRIPTIONS OF JOJALADEVA ; [VIKBAMA-] SA&VAT 1147. 
The first of these inscriptions was found at Sadadi, and the second at ISTsdol, both in tbe Desuri District, G-Odvad Division, Jodhpur State. The former is engraved on a pillarin the temple of Jagesvara, but as all the materials of this temple are said to have been brought from rains elsewhere, it is clear that the iasoriptioa did not originally belong to Sadacji. It contains

11 lines of writing, which cover a space of 8" broad by 6|" high. The second inscription is incised on a pillar in the templeof Somesvara, and bears 13 lines of writing which cover a space of 85" broad by 9" high. The letters of the first are deeply cat, and, excepting two or 
three aksharas at the beginning of lines 8-] 0, the record ia well preserved. The second is weather-worn and has not yielded satisfactory impressions. The whole of it, however, is intact. The characters are Nagari The language is Sanskrit, and both the inscriptions are in prose. 
In respect of orthography, it is sufficient to state that the letters 6 and v are both denoted by the sign for v. Of words unknown or rarely employed, we may note the following: (1) yairZ, (2) satka, (3) vadaharaka, (4) stilapzla, and (5) pramadakula. Ydtra is a festival which is held on different days for different gods.1 The word is frequently met with in the Bhinmal inscriptions. Satkst, of course means"belonging to," and, though foreignto classical Sanskrit literature, is found in later inscriptions and in Jaina literature. Vadaharaka, I think, is the Sanskritised form of the Marwari word badero, meaning "an old man." The word $ulapala> which occurs only in No. II, is givenin Monier-Williams' Dictionaryto mean"the keeperof a brothel or frequenter of brothels," but the sense intended here seems to be that of"associates of courtezans, who accompanythem on musical instruments while singingor dancing." Pramadvkula m^ans obviously a host of courtezans, and is used in this sense also in the Bhinmal inscriptions. 
The contents of both the inscriptions are almost identical, They are dated on Wednesday, the second of the bright half of Vaisakha in the [Vikrama-] year 1147 and refer themselves to the reign of Jojaladeva, who, in No. I, is styled Maharaja and, in No. II, Maharajadhirsja. They lay down the order of the kingwith regardto the management of festivals in connection with all the gods, such as Lakshmanasvamin and others. The order is that when the festival of any particular god commences, the courtezans attached to the templesof the other gods must also put on their ornaments and best garments and attend with their falapiilas to celebrate it by instrumental music, dancing, singing, and so forth. Jojaladeva goes even to the extent of conjuring his descendants and other princesto keepthe festivals of all the gods going in this manner, and warns them by adding that he, who, at the time of a festival, attempts to abolish this practice, be he an ascetic, an old person,or a learned man, should be prevented from doing so bythe reigning ruler. The inscription ends with a curse on those princes who will not maintain this practice, 
In, the temple of JagesVaraat Sadadi, where No. I was engraved on a pillar, other inscriptions also are found, but incised on another pillar of exactlythe same style. Prom them it is clear that the temple of Lakshmanasvamin was at Nadula, i.e. NadOl. Again, in order that the festival of one god may be celebrated bycourtezans attached to other temples,all the temples must be in one and the same town, ie. in USTadol. The name -of the god Laksh manasvamin suggests that he was so called, after Lakshmana, the founder of the Harw&r branch of the Chdhans.

\vell preserved. The characters are Nagarl. The signfor d is worthy of note (e,g.in. Padrada, Chhechhadiya, and so forth), and occnrs in the Nadol copper-piato inscription of Kirtipa'la, Some of the letters are partially engraved. To take an instance, the left upper atroke of ma in PadrafiSr-gramein 1. 2 is missing, and the letter looks like no,. The language is Sanskrit, and the whole record is in prose except the concluding benedictoryverse. In respect of orthography, it is sufficient to note that the sign for v denotes both v and 6. As regards lexicography, the following words may "be noticed: jagati and maliti-s.ihaiiiya in 1. 1, and Java and Jidraka in 1. 2. Jagatiis found in many inscriptions in the sense off ' the grounds." It corresponds,in my opinion,to the Hindi word jagah or jagy& and the Marathi word jaga.1 Sahaniy a most probably corresponds to the desi word sahani, meaning "master of stables." The same word occurs as a title of two Paramara Rajputsin an inscription incised on a jamb of the hall door of the Mlakantha-Mahadeva templeat Nana. Java and h>iraka are also found in another inscription in the same templeat Sevadl. They occur as haraka and Java in No. XV below. Both are used in connection with an aralwta (araghatfa), i.e. a well with a wheel attached thereto for drawing water. From this it appearsthat Java or Java must be taken in the sense of yava, barley-corn. Safaka seems to be the same as the Marathi word hara, a large basket of a particnla-r form and of loose texture, often used in measuring corn. This receives confirmation from No. XV. 
The inscription is dated on the first of the bright half of Chaitra of the [Vikrama] year 1167, when Asvaraja was the Mdh&rajUdhiraja and Katukarftja lb' yuwirrijfi, or hoir-apparent. It then records a grant by Uppalaraka, son of TJttimaraja and grandsonof Pfiavi, the Great Master of Stables (maha-sahaniya), together with his family, the names of some oE whose members are specified. The gift was made for the daily worshipof Sri-Dnarmanatha deva in the temple of Samipati, and what was granted was barley-corn equalto one Mraka from everyone of the wells (arahafa) belongingto the villagesof Padrada, Medcamcha', Chhechhadiya and Maddadi. 
Of the localities mentioned, Saniipati is doubtless Sevadl, which is also pronounced as Semvadi. And Dharmanathadeva must be unquestionablythe divinityinstalled in the cell, above the door of which the inscriptionis engraved. Chhechhadiya again must be ChhSchhli, about 4 miles to the north of Sevadl. The rest are unidentifiable. :

STONE INSCRIPTION OF KATUKARAJA; 
[VIKEAMA-] SA&VAT 1172. 
The inscription is incised on the lintel of the door of another cell in the front corridor of the temple of Mahavira at SevadL It is highly -weather- worn and cannot consequentlyTati easily deciphered. It was again bedaubed with redlead, when I was there, I do not know for v?liat purpose,An estampage taken of it with my own hands has, however, enabled me to rea.d al most the whole of it with certainty. It consists of 8 lines, and covers a spaceof 2'l^" broad by 4j" high. The characters are Nagari. The signfor b occurs in the inscription, fj.y,in vibudka-patP in 1. 1, bal-adhipahin 1. 4, and so forth. The languageis Sanskrit, and., ex<fOpt ing the opening Om and the date at the end, the whole o the inscriptionis in verse* The verses are numbered and are 15 in all. One solecism occnrs in sriy-adharo in 1. 2. In respect of orthography, the only points that call for notice are (1) the occasional t*so of iho letter v both for u and b, and (2) the substitution of n for n in conjunct consonants, e,f/. in puny&'Viam\taht 1, 3, vitirnnam, 1. 6, and so forth. As regards lexicography, attention ruy bu drawn to the word Hattaka occarringin 1. 7. I came across the same -word in an inscription in a shrine of the Jaina templeat Pali, the principal town of the district of the sa>rrie xmmo, Jodhpur State. This word occurs also in the Abii inscriptions, e.g.it is used in 1. 40 of JriK;rip tion No. I. (above, Vol. VIII, p. 213), vrhere the meaningof' niche' appears to bo *Ui but certain. & This sense fits here exactly. In line 3 again,is the word bhukti, which does riot here simply denote a territorial division as elsewhere, but rather a provinceor a gi-oup of villages enjoyed aa jagir. Lastly, the carious expression Maghe Tryamva(ba}ka-sampra^pfftu inl,t> also deserves to be noticed in this connection. Itliterally means "in Magha on tjie arrival of Tryambaka (Siva)," and I am all but certain that it denotes what is popularly kuown ay the Siva-r&tri, the 14th of the dark half of Magha. 
The inscription opens with an invocation of Ssntinatha, the sixteenth Tirttia,rhknraw Verse 2 gives the name of Anahila, and his son named Jimda is mentioned irt the. vi-reo folio-wing as proacient in polity and as belongingto the Chahamana dynasty. His son waa ASvaraja, and the son of the latter was Katukaraja (vv. 4-5). In verse 6 we are told tKat in hi* bbvkti, i.e. the province enjoyed by him, was the town named. Samipati (Sgvadi), and at this place there was a temple of Vlranatha (Mahavira), bearing comparison with paradise. -j? roni verse 7 onwards we are introduced to a different line of descent. In this verse we are informed that there was one Tasodeva, leader of the army (baUdMpa), of pure sonl, and foremost in the

assemblies of kings and mahajams (banias).Tlie next verse sayu that he, of equable mind, was never flagging in conferring favours on the relatives, friends, and virtuous people of the Shan deraka gackchha. His son was Bahada, who was well known amongst the learned like Visva karma (verse 9), and the son of Bahada was Thallaka, who was devoted to the Jaina religion and was an object of the king's favour (verse 10) . To Thallaka an annual benefaction of eight drammas was made by Katukaraja on the Siva-ratri day in the month of Magha (vv. 11-12). 
Verse 13 expresses a wish for the continuance of the gift so longas the sun and the moon last made for the worship of Sanfcioatha in the kkattaka of Yasodeva. In the next verse we are told that the image of Santinatha in the templeof Jina in Samipati was caused to be made by his grandfather. The last is an imprecatory verse, threatening with punishment those who would resume the grant. The inscription ends with the mere date Samvat 1172, correspond ing to A.D. 1115. 
It will be seen from the above account that the grantor was Katukaraja, son of Asraraja. But he does not appear to have been a ruler at the time. For in none of the verses is he spoken of as king, and in verse 6 we are informed, as we have seen, that Samipati (Sevadi) was in his bhukti. Here neither the word rajya which would have suited the metre, nor any other term synonymous with it is used. This shows that even in A.D. 1115, the date of the inscription, he was a yuvardja enjoying some villages as jaglr. 
Shamderaka-sad-gachchha is no doubt the same as the Samderaka gachohha of the NadOl plates of Alhaaadeva dated V.E. 1218, and the Sandera or Shanderaka gachchha, of the Mount Ab9 inscriptions. Sandera or Sbanderaka is to be identified with the present Sanderav, 10 miles north-west of Bali, the principal town of the district of the same name, Gcdvad Division. The name occurs also in an inscription in the temple of Mahavira at that place (below No. XVI). It is one of the many instances in which the Jaina gachchhas are called after the names of places in Marwar.TEXT.1

The language is Sanskrit, and the whole of the record is in prose, exceptingone verse in H, 4-5, nl respect of- orthography, the only pointthat deserves to be noted is the doubling of a consonant in conjunction with a precedingr.

This inscription was fonnd in a Jaina temple at Nadlai, 8 miles to the north-west of Destri, the principal town of the district of the same name, Godvad Division. The temple is now dedicated to Adinatfca, but there can be no donbt, as will be seen from other inscriptions, that it waa originally dedicated to Mahavlra. The inscription in questionIB engraved oix a lintel standing on two pillars in the sdbha-mantfapa. The lines of the inscription nm parallel to one another but not to the edgesof the lintel, and the topsof some of the concluding letters in the first line have been cut off, necessarily being outside the upper edge of the lintel.

the inscription, and that the lintel on which it is incised is no longer preserved in its original form. 
The record contains 6 lines of writing which cover a apace of 1' 5V "broad by4?,-" high. The surface of the stone does not appear to have been dressed before engravingthe inscription, and the letters also do not seem to have been carefully incised. The characters ara Ntigari. Of these yis written as if it were p,as is often seen in Sanskrit manuscripts. Next, the form o! the letter 4 in Naduladdgika, 1. 2, is worthy of note and is exactlylike that noted in No. III. Tha languageis Sanskrit, and the whole of the inscriptionis in prose, ex cepting a verse at the end, which, however, offends against the metre. In respect of orthography, it deserves to be noticed first that there is but one b in the inscrip tion and it is denoted bythe Bign for , in waAaia(7t7a), 1. 5, and secondly, that the final consonant is represented bythe addition, of the suffix u as, e.g. yad by yadit in 1. 5. The same orthographic peculiarity I have noticed in the later copper-plate inscriptions of the Guhilot princes, which are found in Gcdvad. Aa regards lexicography, the words pala, and palika employedin 1. 3 doubtless denote some kind of liquid measure. Details of it have been, set forth in Beruni, Indica, Vol. I. p. 164. Attention may also be drawn to the abbreviated forms herein employed, lham, 1, 3, and rd and ', 1. 4. Sham9, of coarse, stands for Vkamdaw, the name of a well-known subdivision of the Osvals, and rH for rauta which is supposed to be a corruptionof rajaputrat and is the same as the modern ravat, one of the designations borne by Rajput jaglrdars.I do not know the full form of in. In 1. 3 is used the word gjianaka^ which correspondsto ghani and signifies an oil-mill, It 13 frequently met with in inscriptions, 
The inscription is dated the 5th of the bright half of Magha in the [Vikrama] year 1180, and speaks of a grant made by Budrapala and Amritapala, sons of the Malnrtfidhiriija Bayapala of the Chahamana dynasty,in conjunction with their queen-mother Manaladevl. The gift was of two palikasout of those due to the royal family from each oil-machine (otoa&a) and was made for the (Jaina)saints in and outside Naduladagika (Nadlat). The witnesses to this religious benefaction were the villagers (gramina&a) TtimatS, a rauta, Siriya A w 5Posari a lania, and Laksbmana, headed^ by Nagasiva, a lhand>lrl They apparently formed the pamcfa of the village.

It is engraved on a pillar, and ig, on the whole, well preserved.It consists of 26 lines ofwriting, and covera aspaceof 9{-" broad byI' 11J* high. The characters are Kagari. Thelanguageis Sanskrit, As regards orthography, the only pointthat calls for notice is the use of matu for mai(d) in matwfattaw, 1. 22. Of unknown or rare words 'bJwUari,1. 9, jeka,1. 11, and aWmija, 1. 12, may be noticed, For the first I can suggest no meaning. Seka is perhapsthe same as the Sanskrit sik^ja meaning"a kind of loopor swing made of rope and suspended from either end of a poleor yoketo receive a load (also appliedto the load so carried).1 ' The word alhimja Las, in my opinion, the sense of"income, proceeds," and occurs in no less than three different compoundsin a Mangrol inscriptionof V.E. 1202.5 It is also employedas a component of another compoundin Bhinmal inscriptionsrTos. XII and XV.6Perhaps another word may also be noticed, vis. rauta, which occurs in 11. 8 and 21. It is evidentlya corruption of Rtijapiitra and is the same aa Rajput, but is here nsed to denote apparently a jagird&r, 
The inscription opens with obeisance to the Omniscient, who is here Neminatha. It then gives the date, m. Tuesday, the 16th of the dark half of Isvina in the [Vikrama] year 1195, and refers to the rnle of the MaMraj&dhirSJa Bayapaladeva over NaduladagikJ (Nadlai). It then states that for lamp, incense, offering, flowers, worship and so forth of Sri Neminatha, the thvitikwo, Bajadeva, son of the rmta Udharana of the Q-uhila family, granted for his spiritual merit one-twentieth partof the income (abliavycL) derived from the loads on bullocks goingon. their wayor comingto NMlai, Then a requestis made to future rulers for the preservationof the grant ;and Kmaila is givenas the name of the individual who wrote the record. Then conies the sign-mannalof KSjadeva, who is here called a ruuta, which is followed bythe name of the witness Gugi, son of theastrologer DMupa, The last three lines are not intelligible to me.

inscription can be read with certainty on the originalatone. The characters are Nagari. The liiDii'ua^e is Sanskrit, and the whole of the inscriptionis in prose. Some of the solecisms that occur in the record are nirga/nate,1. 20, nirgamamtan.lm, 1. 15, and nirgamapayathtanaih,1, 19. In respect of orthography, it is sufficient to note (1) that is (correctly) doubled in conjunction with a preceding ? in pravLtrttamane,1. 3, (2) that the dental s is frequentlysubstituted for the palatal .v, (3) that the signfor v is used also for 6, and (4) that there is a curious tendency exhibited hero of ending proper names with u or . The desi words employedare (1) vada or vadnii, vasn and ptdi (11. 4-8) which still in Marwar have the sense of wards or localities in a to\vn ; (2) peta, a belly, (3) avasara, 1. 24, i.e. osrd or osri, ante-chamber or porch (above, Yol. I. p. 1C5), and (4) chaukadika, 1. 13, of uncertain meaning, hat apparently signifyinga, paw.liayat. The unusual words used in the inscription are (1) karpatika,1. 12, a pilgrim nr caravan of pilgrims, (2) dauvarika, doorkeepersof kingSj known as dudidars in Rajpntana, and (3) kdya-vrata, 1. 21, which doubtless has the same sense as that of the word tr&ga or cMndi, i.e. a kind of privation and self-immolation so commonly practised once in Bajputana and Gnjnrat by Brahmaiias and Bhats to force the kingsto relent and granttheir wishes. Two curio as expressions occurringin the record also deserve to be noticed. The first iapefam pnslitim vd dar&'ayati, 11. 20-21, and the second v8,(ba>)te-<pi gramthir-n-Ssti,1. 23,both, of which are d$$i idioms unknown to Sanskrit literature. The former consists of two separate expressions : (1) petam darsayatilit."shows his belly"but really"asks for means of liveli hood," and (2) prishtiw dar&ayatilit.<( shows his back," i.e."flies away and thus shirks his responsibility." The second exactly correspondsto the Hindi phraseeven now in use,in Kajputana at any rate, vis. bdl parbhi gcimth nalw, which is employedfor absolving a man from all blame. 
The inscription opens with the date, vis. Sunday, the 8th of the dark half of SrSvana in the [Vikrama] year 1198, and refers itself to the blessed and victorious reignof the Mah&r&js d'tiraja SrI-Rayapaladeva. It then makes mention of sixteen Brahmanas of the town of Dhalopa, residing in. ei^htdifferent wards, Yirigu and Prabhakara belongedto Merlvadiij Asaduu ntid Mahacliito Dipavada, Deu and Ghahadi to Dum^anavasu, Muhamkaru andDivakaiu to ULfimgiiravadaii, Deva'ichu and Dharaii to Pipalavada* Farayanaand Mahaioha te Ambilavaoja, Asigu and Aeapalu to Khaikhannalavada, and Devamgu and Amviga to Hiuiidavuda. Headed byall these Brahmanas, two from each of the eight wards of DhalSpa and with Devaicha aa the mediator, the whole peopleof bhe town tendered a document written (i.e. signed) with their own hands. It contains a solemn promiseon their partto find out, in siocurdance with the custom of the country, by means of the chauka$ilt& or paflch&yat system, whatever is lost1, by, or snatched away from, the bhata, bhattaputra, dauv&rika, karpafika, Vaitijjftra'ka, and others on their way. If it was, however, lost at their own place,i.e. at any particular ward in DhalSpa, the responsible individuals thereof already named were to find it out in person. Honey, weapons, watchmen, and so forth were supplied by the MahSrSja Sii-Kuyapala to them for tracing things lost, and so there was no need of assigning the duties of a watchman to any one amongst them. A declaration was also made to the effect that,if any Brfilimana amongst them, when being asked by chiefs (ranaka} f fco find out some lost property, refused to do so, asked for means of subsistence or Bed away, or,if apprehended, had recourse to lefiyavrata or self-immolation, he would die like a cur, donkey,or c&cwrfSZa, and the chiefs (mnaka], such as Bayapala and others, would in no vvise be opento blame. Then is given a list of the names of the individuals "who bore witness to the document, They are aa follow: (1) Katuka and the Brahmana Sajanu come from, i.e., representingthe Wiaffsraka tla (.residing) in the avasara (osrz) of the temple belongingto irl-Jayasimhadeva, (2) the bhtftaraka Varnnasiii of (the temple of) Anahilesvara, (3) the bhatjaraka Mahesvarasiu of (the temple of) Jendrarajesvara, (4) the bhattaraka Jnanasiii of (the temple of) Anupam-

vesvara, (5) the bhattsr^a Item attached (pratibaddha) to the bhattaraTca BLflpSof (the temple of) Prithvipalesvara, (6) the &fc,a?/araka Muktideii of(tlio tmnlo of) J5jala57ar (7) the lha,tl&ralta Vinayaka and Samtisiii of (the temple of) Tripumaha, (8) the bhatl&raka Muladeii of (the temple of) Asalesvara, (9) the MaftOrofca Tafcpurusha of (the temple^ of) 
Padmalesvara, (10) the Uafprofca Kedaru of (the temple of) [Tripala]kesvara, (11) the ttaftfrafca Brahmarasi of (the temple of) Asapalesvara, (12) the aia/f Sagahari belonging to Dvaravati and of (the temple of) Prithvipalesvara, (13) the ab^Jagadtaru belongingto Dvaravati and of (the temple of) Asaleavara, (14) the atop Sri-VachhG belongingto Dvaravati and of (the temple of) Tripurusha, (15) the whole class of bankers (iafctfaa), suck as Devadhara and others, belonging to Anahillapura, and (16) the whole class of bankers such as Seth Jasadhavala Katakavala, and BO forth. Then in 11. 37-39 we are informed that the 
record was written, U drawn up,I think, by the thakwra Pethada, son of Vadiga, a Gauda Kayastha, with the conBent of thepeopleof Dhalopa. At the end is a line, statingthat the record is approved by all the people of Dhalopa. 
Of the places mentioned, Dhalcpa is obviously the village of that name, about 4 miles to the south-south-west of Naflol. Anahillapura is, of course, ArihilvadS near the modern Patna, in the Kadi Division, Baroda State. Dvaravati is doubtless Dvarka on the western coast of Kathiavad. Of the caste names mentioned, bUta is the same as bhat or bards, Bliatta-putra is moBt likely intended for Barhot, the higher class of professional panegyrists. Dauvurika is probably not a caste-name, and signifies here what are known as dujid&n in Rajputana Vttfjittrika is Vanjaria, whoae hereditary callingis that of carrying grains on pack-bullocks The name occurs under the form of morale* in No. XI. below and mwjy&aluL in a copper-plate grant of Tribhuvanapaladeva.i Alotis are an inferior cla69 of BrahmanaB, who are generaUy temple servants, and are still chiefly found ia Dvarka. Of the names of tbo Maltarafas of temples, many end in dil (Siva), two in dS* (dem], and only one in rSti. I bayo elsewher^ said that of the four well-known sects of the followers of Siva,, those whose names ended in Siva were Saivas, and those whose names ended in *m woro Lafcnllga Paanpatas J'" to what sect the ascetics who bore the honorific suffix deii (feo) belonged, .l/not clear.' A^iin". the gods, to whose temples the bhattSrdca* were attached, were, it will be seen, named after" the kings. The god Jayasiihhadeva was doubtless called after the Caaulukya soveraiga Jayasimha Anahilesvara after Anahilla, great-graDdsou of Lakshmana, the founder of the Cnahamana family of Marwar; JendrarajMvara after Jendraraja or Jinduraja, son of Analiilla- Prithvl palesvara and JojalesVara, after the first and second sons of Jeudraraja ; and AsaleSvaru wha ia the same as Asapalesvara of 1, 32, after Asvapala, elder brother of Achilla, Ajwpaw&vw* Padmalelvaraand [Tripftla]kfi*vara must similarly have been named, bat pi^ts of thscs'ntHuls have not yet been traced in inscriptions,

X. NADLAI STONE INSCRIPTION OF RAYAPiLA; 
. [VIKRAMA-jSAMVAT 1200. 
This inscription was found in the temple of Adinatha at ISadlal, and is engraved on a lintel just opposite to that on which No. VII is inched. It contains 5 lines^of writing which cover a space o V 9" broad by 4|" high. The letters were filled with plaster when I first saw the inscription. The plaster had afterwards to be scraped of! for enabling us to read the inscriptioa. The characters are Tfagari. The language is Sanskrit, and the record is in 
prose excepting the verso at the end, the last pada of which sets the metre at naught. As regards orthography, the only points that call for notice are (1) the use of jatu for yad and (2) the use of the dental for the palatalsibilant. In line 3 occur the curious words vala and pit, of -which the first appears to be incorrectly used for pala and the second apparently an abbre viated form of palika. In line 2 the wordjmZa is used, which seems to signify a certain kind of weight. The same word occurs in the same sense in No. XL In the SiTnak orant of the Chaulukya king Karna.deva, we have the following: pailam 12 vnliamti(t~i) hala 4 tii hala chatushtaya-bhumi. Here also the word has apparently the same meaning. Local inquiries in Go'clvad have given me the followingtable : 
=I payati. 
5 payall=1. 
4 mc/tiassl fie a. 2 m'=l man. 
Another word that may be noted is vimsopaka, which not infrequently occurs in other inscriptions also. It is doubtless a coin, which is equivalentin value to J^fch of the rupee that was then current, 
The inscription opens with the date, vis, Thursday, the 5th of the bright half of Jeshta ( Jyaishtha) in the [Vikrama] year 1200, when the Maharajtidhirfija Srl-Esyapaladeva was reigning. It then records that the rduta Bajadeva, who had come on the occasion of tie rathayakrQ, i.e. the car festival, made, for the sake of his mother, in the presence of the bankers (mahajanas), villagers and the peopleof the province, a religions benefaction consisting of one vimsopaka coin from the value of ike pftilSs accruingto him and two palikas from the palas of oil due to him from every ghanaka or oil mill.

SI.-NADLAI STONE INSCRIPTION OF RAYAPALADEVA ; [VIKRAMA-JSAIftVAT 1202. 
The inscription is engraved on the same lintel as No. X. It contains 5 lines ofwriting, covering a space of 1' 8|" broad by 4|" high. The characters are Nagan. The language ia Sanskrit, and, excepting the usual imprecatoryverse at the end, the whole of the record is in prose. As regards orthography, the only points that call for notice are that a consonant following f ie doubled, and that in L 5 jatu is used instead of yat. Of rare and unusual words herein employed and not previously noticed, desi occurs in 1. 3, and kira$au& and g$$a in 1, 4. The last is used in the sense of"cart," and kiratfauS is, I am told, the same as kfaijaw or Jtir&nSt employed to denote substances, such as gum, dry ginger, black pepper, coriander, and so forth. The meaning of the word desi is not quite certain. It seems temptingto take it in the sense of a guild, in which it occurs in the Peheva inscription of the imperial Pratlhara Bhojadeva I. (above, Vol. Lp. 137, 1. 8) and the Harsha inscription of the Chahamara Vigraharaja (above, Vol. II. p. 124, 1. 38). And this meaning suits here excellently. The same word occurs in another inscription found in the same temple as this, and apparentlyin the same sense. Another expression that requires to be noted is la(l^ga-manatthe meaning of which seems to be"the measure or proportion (tnana)of cess (Uga)." 
The inscription opens with the date, w. Friday, the 5th of the dark half of Asoja (Isvina) in the [Vikrama] year 1202, when Eayapaladeva was the Maforajadhirclj* and the rautoRSjadeva was the thakura of Waduladagika (Nadlai). The object of the inscription is to record that the VanajSrakas (Vanjaris)of Abhinavapurl, BadSri and Nsdlsi having assembled together into a guild (dity, Eajadeva granted, for the sake of the pious and the ascetacs in the temple of Mahavira, rupees two for each twenty prilu loaded on bullocks and rupee one for each cart filled withcommodities, coming under the class of kiranSs. Badari is probably Borli, 8 miles north of Nadlai. Abkinavapuri is unknown to me.

XIL KIRlptr STONE INSCRIPTION OF ALHANADEVA ; 
[VIKRAMA-]SAJfiYAT1209, 
This inscription was found ia a Saiva temple standing amidst the ruins of Eiradii near Hatliinii, about 16 miles north-north-west of Badmer, the principal town of the Mallam District, Jodhpur State . A transcript and translation of it have already been publishedin the Bh&vnagar Prakrit and Sanskrit Inscriptions, p, 172 ff. But this, like almost all the inscrip tions in this book, is edited in a slovenly manner, and I, therefore, make no excuse for re-edit ing it here. 
The inscription consists of 21 lines, coveringa spaceof 1' 5" broad by V 2" high, The middle portion of the stone as far as line 17 has peeledoff. Nothing of importance, how ever Beams to have been destroyed, and the purportof the inscriptionis clear enough. Tha characters are Nagari. The languageis Sanskrit, and the whole of the record is in prose. As regards orthography, it is sufficient to note (1)that a consonant followingr is doubled and (2) thtt the sign for is employedalso for 6, except once in labdJia in 1. 2. In 1. 13 occurs the word wari-ffi#K which, though known to Jaina scriptures,is foreignto Sanskrit literature. It means"the edict of the non-slaughter (of animals)," 
The record opens with the date, t*. Saturday, the 14th of fhe dark half of MSgha in the rVifcramal year 1200, when Kuma(ma)rapalawas the paramonnt eovereign and Mabadeva was doing all the business of the seal, relating_tothe drawing upof documents, etc Lines le sLk of his feudatory, the AfaHrtyaSri- Alanadeva, who obtained Kiratakupa, Latarhada and Li-through his (i.e. Kumarapala's)favour.

From the word tatha in 1. 10 onwards, all the lines appear to have been afterward* added and are engraved in smaller characters. The peculiar form of the letter $ noticed above also occurs here. The language is Sanskrit, and tho whole of the" inscriptionis in prose, As regards orthography, it may be noted that ska is nsed for kha three times (11. 1, 2 and C). In respect of lexicography, the following -words deserre to be noticed \ (1) sra in 11. 5-6 and 12, which seems to Lave been nsed in the senae of, not 'a plough,' -but 'a plcmghmanor cultivator' and (2) se in 1. 7 which stands for sef, a kind of weight mentioned in my remarks on No. X, 
The record is dated on the 3rd of the bright half of Vaisakha in the [Vikrama]year 1233, and speaks of the princes (rajaputra) LakhanapSla and Abhayapala as the proprietors (blioktri) of Samnanaka (cf.

XYin.-JALOR STONE INSCRIPTION OF SAMARASIlSlHADBVA j [YIKRAMA-] SASIVAT 1239. 
This inscription was found at Jalor, the principal town of the district of the same narao, JodhpuT State. It is incised on two lintels, one above the other and standing upon pillars near the north end of the principalcloister of an old mosque, now used as a tdpkhftnft* The mosque in evidently constructed of materials supplied by demolishingold temples, and these two Imteln appear to have been brought from an old Jaina shrine, as will be seen foom the oontontK, Portions of these lintels have been cut off on their proper right in order to mit t&$b? new sur roundings, The inscription on the upper lintel consists of 3 Knee, an4 oOrtaJB a space of 8' 2" broad by tf high, while the lower one is composed of 4 lines, and extends' over a fipaco of 8' 5" broad by 5" high. But though the inscriptions are thus engraved- on two different stones, they really form one record. The portion extant is in a perfect $tate of pi-oaervation. The letters are here and there filled with mortar, but that does not prevent any one deciphering the record. The characters are Nagari. The letter sh is incised at least twice instead of fcfc, u,s in later Rajputana inscriptions. The signfor & occurs, and differs from v only by a* minute dot in the loop of the latter. The languageis Sanskrit, and the record i$ partly in proBO and partly in verse. The verses are numbered, and are seven in all, In respect of orthography, the only point that caUs for notice is the doublingof ^ in conjunction with apreceding r. As regard**

JALOB STONE INSCRIPTION OP 
[VIKRAMA-] SAilVAT 124/2. 
Tho inscription is incised on a lintel in tho second fltoroy ovor the wift,mb of Uu; l referred to in No. XVIII. It consists of 6 lines o writing, and covcrw a wpaooof H' S{j" by 5J" high. The characters are Nagarl. The language IB Sanskrit, and tho whole of the inscription is in prose. In respect of orthography, it is sufficient to notioo (1) that thti signfor y is nsed both for w and b, and (2) that is doubled in conjunction with a preceding/. 
The record contains four different statements, but all pertaining- to one and tho Harms twrtjrlc. The first part speaks of a certain temple aa having been built and oonyigned in tho Vikrama] year 1221 to tho care of Devachsrya for the dissemination of the true Jaiim law (sad-uidhi). The temple was known as Kuvara-vihara and contained tho principal imago (mwZu-,7wfta) of Parsvanatha. The temple, we are told, had been constructed bythe M^lrnjaOUiirl'ia, Chaul lakya Eumarapala, the devout worshipper of tho Arhats (param-drAato), tho lord of tho G-urjara country, after being enlightened by prathv, Hemasuri, upon the fort o Karbohaiia giri belonging to Jabalipura,. ie. JElor. It will thua be seen that it was called Kuvara-vihAra after the Solahki king Knmarapala who built it. The socond part aays that ifc was rebuilt in V.E. 1242 by the bhMdri Yasovira, son o the bharhdari PasQj in aocordanoo with tho orders of the Maharaja Samaraeimhadeva, the ornament of the Chshamsna family and lord of"thj

verse in lines 1-3, the record is in prose. The languageis Sanskrit, interspersed with Rolecisms and provincialisms. With regardto orthography, it is sufficient to saythat a consonant is but occasionally doabled in conjunction with a precedingr and that in 1. IV dimvaaa in used instead of diaasa. As regards lexicography, the following words maybe noticed : (1) tjodhuma pakua, 1. 11, which seems, I think, to mean a cropof wheat readyfor being reaped ; (2) muga in 
11.11 and 19, obviou sly the well-known mung pulse; (3) cliosha,i.e. chokha, 11, 11 anil 19, a dest word meaning 'rice'; (4) vyasa, 11. 12 and 22, a Brahman a, who recites the PurfinaH in pnblic; (5) nirvfipa, 11. 12 and 19, a dole; and (6) amga-bhoga, unguentsto l>o appliedto the body immediately after bathing. Again,abbreviated forms of some words arc usod, Thus, dra stands for dramma, Tea, for Jcalasa, ma for manft, yd, for payala,or p&yuti, and se for s<~i, For the table of weights still observed in Gfldvad, see my remarks on No. X. Ealasia in of COUI-HO a measure of capacity. 
The inscription opens with obeisance to Surya, and then follows a verso in praiso of the same deity. The date is afterwards given, which is the 14th of the dark half of Asvina in the [Vikrama] year 1306. The Maharajadhiraja Sri-TJdayasimhadeva was tho kiti# and the 
paficha coneisting of the mdhamta Gajasirhha and others appointed by him was exorcising- local authority at Sri mala (B hi nmal). The object of the inscriptionis to record two benefactions. One was made by two brothers, the name of the first of whom is gone but that of tho noeoml in Mahanaslha. They were both sons of the thakura Udayaslna, aud were Mathura Kfiyaslhas by caste. Forty dramma coins were deposited in the treasury of the god Jagateviimin, which was the name of the Snrya divinity of Bhinmal, as is proved by other inHoriptiona ami the Srimtlapur&na.

lu-nrly tlio whole of ihc inscription can be read with certainty. The characters are Wagari. The l;njn-ULitre is Sanskrit, and the record is in prose. As regards orthography, the only points that call for notice are (1) the doublingof a consonant following an r, and (2) the use of the form s-li/7'ju.V for snmanta . As to lexicography, the following words may be noticed: (1) stJiitaka iu 11. 5, 7, S and 11, and (2) si'lahatha or selahasta together with their abbreviated forms in 11. 10, 1'2, 13 and 15. The first word seoms to have been used in the sense of "a grant in perpetuity," and occurs in other inscriptions also, e.g. the Cintra prafastiof SarangadSva,1verses 53, 60, 01 and GO. The meaningof selahasta is not certain. And I know of only two records, r/r. the Bhinmfil inscriptions Nos. XII and XVs where the word occnrs. In the first of these, line 12 has Srikarajuya'panchakula-selaliatha-pabhinarapalaMcha. Here it is worthy of note that selahatha occupies a position between panchakula, i.e. the modern panoha and Dabhi uarapala, i.e. a king of the Dabhi race. And it seams tempting, therefore, to suppose that st'-lafia-sta was an officer of high rank, higherat any rate than the village srtkarana, which was held by one of ike panchaknla. Again,the expression selahath-abhavya occurs in both the ]iliinmal inscriptions just referred to. It muat be taken to mean "the income collected by a .^hiliatha" Probably he was connected with the revenue department. Some of the abbre viation* are worth noticing. Thus in 1. 8 we have Visa dra, which, I think, stands for }'hi:laprnjuL-dniinma, a kind of coin, mentioned in Bhinmal Inscription No. XVI, 11. 23-24. Again, in 1. 12 ka, is used in connection with muga, i.e. Phaeeolus nmngo, Here ha cannot be tiikcii to denote kwslia, as H karshas of muga would be a ridiculously smallquantity, but kalasa which had till lately been employedfor measuring corn. 
The inscription commences by specifyingthe date, wz. Monday, the 14th of the bright half of Karttika in the [Vikrama] year 1345. The Mali&rajakula Samvatasiiiihadeva was the king, and at the holy place (mabasthana) of Satyapura (Sanchor), the^anc^o, consistingof the ma.1 amia Hira and others appointed by him, was exercisinglocal authority. The epigraph then. records a grant in perpetuityof 8 Vtsala-priya drammas by the Meharas3 Prabha, Padama and Asapala. All the Meharas are requested to see to the continuance of this grant. According to 
this endowment, H kalasas of muya were to be given annually, and the selahasta was requested to look after this matter. The selahasta is also desired to supervise personally the yatra festival of the god Yaesvara. Then follow, in token of approval, the sign-manuals of at least four Meharas, of whom three were the donors named above and the fourth was the selahasta Patala.

5XII-JUNA STONE INSCEIPTIOtf OF   
[VIKRAMA-] SA&VAT 1352. 
This inscription ^vas found at Juna or Juna Badmer, as the full name goes, in the Mallajil District, Jodhpur State, aboat 12 miles south-west of Badmer, the principal town. It is en graved on a pillar in the porch of a dilapidated Jaina temple and contains 10 lines of writing which cover a space of 11 f broad by 7f high. The characters are Nagarl, The languageis Sanskr.it, and the whole of the inscriptionis in prose, exceptingthe benedictoryverse at the end. In respect of orthography, the only points that call for notice are(1) the employment of the sign of v for both v and 6, and (2) the nse of the number 2 after rt in 1. 3 to mark the repeti tion. As regards rare or unusual words, those that deserve to be noted are paila and BUma/ptnya vi(m)$ffp<Lka in 1. 7, P^ila and vtmsdpiika have been already explained. Bbima priya appearsto have been the name of a kind of Mmtopakacoin. Attention may also be dra\vn to the word Uga in 1. 8, which means a cess, as previously explained (No. XI above.) 
The record opens with the date, the 4th of the bright half of Vaisskha in the [Vikrama] year 1352. On the aforesaid day, daringthe victorious reignof the Mahar&jakulo, Sri-Samanta simhadeva, the mahamta ChirSsila, VelSula, the bftam^ar* Migala, and others appointed by the king to draw up documents, made a religions grantat Bahadameru to the gods Vighna mardana-Kshetrapala and Chaumdaraja, in the templeof IdinStha. The grant consisted of a pailn from every incoming or outgoing caravan exceeding ten camels and twenty bullocks In default of this payment in kind, ten Bhmapriya vimsSpakas were to be charged. The grant wag to be distributed equally between the two gods. Inl. 8 is recorded the approvalof thia cess (iSga) by the wlwjanas or local bankers. 
Bahadameru is, of course, Bsdmer, not the place now known bythat name which is com paratively a modern city, but Juns Bsdmer, the old EodmSr where the inscription was found.

XXIII. JALOR STONE INSCRIPTION OF SAMANTASI&HADSVA ; [VIKRAMA-J SA&VAT 1353. 
The inscription ia engravedon a pillar in the topkhanaat JSlor in the main or western cloister near the south end. It consists of 27 lines of writing, and covers a Bpace of 4|/; broad by 1' 8'' high. The characters are Nagari. The signfor sh is used to denote kh. The language is Sanskrit, and the whole of the inscriptionis inprose. As regards orthography, the only points that call for notice are (1) the occasional use of v for fe and (2) the doubling of n in 
conjunction with a precedingr in Suvarnna'girati,1. 3. In respect of lexicography, attention maybe drawn to the expression nisra-nikshepa-hatta,in 11. 22-23, the meaningof which is uncertain, and to the word bhfitaka, in 1. 24, which seems to have been used in the sense of lhada or rent. The followingsense of the phrase ntira-nikshepa-batta may, however, be suggested as probable. Eatta is, of course, a bazar. NisrS is probablythe same as nisar, which, in Marwar at any rate, seems to mean an exportin contradistinction with pasar which signifies an import. The expression might, therefore, mean a place in, or a portion of, the bazar for storing goods to be exported. 
The record opens with the date, vis. Monday, the 5th of the dark half of Vaisakha of the [Vikrama] year 1353. It then speaksof the MahSrdjahula Sama(n)taaimha as reigningat Suvarnagiri and Kanhadadeva as"subsisting on his lotus-like feet and. bearingthe burden of administration (r&jya-dhwS)," Suvarnagiri is the aame as Kanchanagiri of No. XIX., and is the name of the hill on which the fort of Jal<5r stands. Kanhadadeva, aa we shall see further on, was a son. of Samantasimha, The object of theinscriptionis to state that a certain Narapati made, for the spiritual welfare of his wife Nayakadevi, the grant of a bazar building or ware house for storing goods to be exported. Out of the rent accruing therefrom was to be offered the pamchanil-bali every yearin the temple of the god ParsvanStha by the members of the gostyU.

vareha of Malava, for wliom we have dates ranging from A.D. 974 to 993. The invasion of Munjaraja here referred to is in all probabilitythe same as that mentioned in the Hathundi inscription of the Rafibtraknta princes.1 Therein Dhavala is said to have checked the fur ther progress of ?iV* iv"< ; :''-'-.'Prick*-''. Medapata (Mowar) anddestroyedits capital called Aghata.3Baliraja was succeeded by Mahendra also called Mahindu, son of Vigrahapala, who was the paternal uncle of Baliraja. As was first pointed out byProf. Kielhorn, this Mahendra is no doubt the same as his namesake, referred to in v. 11 of the Bathundi inscription. It speaks of Dhavala as having protected Mahendra when he was being harassed by the armyof Durlabharaja. This Durlabharaja can be no other than the Chaulnkya king Dnrlabhariija, the brother and successor of Vigraharajaof the Earsha inscription.3 Mahendra's son was Asvapala.4 His son was AMla, who, accordingto the Snndha hill inscription, defeated the ChaTilukya king Bhimadeva I. He was succeeded byhis paternal nncle, Anahilla,5 who was a son of Mahendra. He, too,is spoken of as having vanquished Bhimadeva I., seized Sakambhari, slain Sadha, a general (dand-adhisa) of the Malava king Bhoja, and defeated a Turushka, i.e. a Mnhammadan king/' After him came to the throne his son Balaprasada. He compelled Bhimadeva I. to liberal r^m prison a king named Krishnadeva. As shown by Professor Kielhorn, the last king is t!u> ParamSra Krishnaraja, eon of Dhandhuka and grandson of Devaraja, for whom we have two inscriptionsat Bhiumal dated in A.D. 1060 and 1067. It 
can hardly be donbted that he mast have been abrother of the Paramara, prince, Purnapala, who was a son of Dhandhuka and grandson of Mahipala, and for whom we have the dates A.D.' 1042 and 1045.7 Both the dates and the names of the father agree with one another. Krishnaraja 
must, therefore, be taken to he a younger brother and successor of Purnapala. The discrepancyin the names 
^oftheir grandfathers that of Kri.ihnaraja's being Devaraja and that of Purtrnpala'a being Mahipala ie not of any Kenans importance, ns we have several instances of one and the same priuce bearing mure than one name, not onlyof identical, but also of different import, Balapraaada was succeeded by his brother Jinduraja also known as Jindaraja or JendrarSja He gained a victory at Sandera, which, as I have already aaid, is Sanderav in the Bali District Q6dya4 divisionj5dhpur_State (JSo.

that reason been replaced by Rayapala, one of their relatives. From No. VII. it seems that thia Rayapala had a queen named Manaladevi, and at least two sons, named Rudrapala and Amrita pSla by her, Under him was the rauta Bajadeva,son of the rwta tTdharana of the Gtahila family. He was a fhakur of Nadliladagika, which, as stated above, was the Sanskritised form of Nadlai. In an inscription found at Nadol, a certain rSnaka Bhnnana is mentioned as belonging to the Karnata counfay and as a contemporaryof Kayapala, This prince cannot be identified, but appears to have come to NadOl to paya friendlyvisit to the Ghaharaana king, 
From V.E, 1203 (A,D. 1146)to 1218 (A.D, 1161) not a single inscription has been traced in GCdvad of the Chahamana princesof Nadol, bnt we have fonnd instead no less than four records of a person who is variouslycalled Vaijaka, Vaija, Vaijalladeva and Vayajaladeva, He is spoken of as a dantfanayahaor generalof KumSrapala and as reigningat Jfradol, i.e. exacfcty in the capital town of ihe Chahamanas described above. This change of rule over Go^vad may perhaps be explained as follows. We know from Gujarataccounts that Kumarapala invaded the Ssmbhar territory and defeated Arnora"ja.1 This event is alluded to in a ChitCrgadh inscription of Kumarapala dated V.E. 120 7,3 and is spokenof as having taken place shortly before this date, KayapaU perhaps aided with ArnoTaja and broughtabout Kumarapala'e indignation. And Kumfirapala might have deprived him of his territory. At Pali in the templeof ScmSsvara there is a much abraded inscription of the reignof this Chaulukya sovereign with the date V.E, 1209. An epigraph in a dilapidated templeat Bbafcund in the Bali District is dated V. B. 1210, refers itself to the reign of Kumarapala, and mentions his dantfan&yaka Vaija ka as beingin charge of the district of Nad^la (Nadol). The templeof Mahavira at SSvadi contains a record dated in Samvat 1213, which speaksof dafoja? (i.&. dan$an$yalta) Vaija as ruling at Nadula. Another Jaina temple at Ghanerav in the Desuri District has an inscription dated the same year as the last and referring itself to the reign of the damfanayaka Vaijalladgva, On a lintel of, the tabhavwnjiipa, of the templeof Sola or Bahngnna mats, at Bali is engraved an epigraph.,which specifies the date Samvat 1216, makes mention of the paramount sovereign Kumarapala ancfspeaks of damja* Vayajaladeva as exercisinglocal authority at Naddrttla (Nftijol). It will thus be seen that from about V.E. 1209 to 1216 KumSrapala deprived Rayapala, or some other Chahamana 
prince of his ancestral dominions, and stationed Vaijalaxteva as dapfanayaba, over that province. Bat, though Kumarapala wrested Godvad from the Ohfthamana ruler of N&m he was well-disposed towards llanadera or llhanadeva, son of AsVaraja and younger brother of Katukaraja, For, an inscription in a Siva temple at Kiradfl-Malianl (No. XH above) tells us that llhanadeva was then in possessionof Kirstaktipa (Kiraja), Latarhada (R&ddhada) and Sivs (Sheo) and that he obtained these places through the favour of Ma overlord (prabM Kumarapala.8 r ' wthat^N^preyinoeca^^d^^^^ 80m0 year^^yfi MM

said about him that, although he WaB the lor,l of the Naddula(N^oi)_ kingdom,he established himself at Jabalipura,i.e. Jalor, the principal to^n of the district of the same name in the southern part of Mar war. Accordingto Muta Kensi, lie *ted it from the Paramaras. Certain it is that Jal or was in the possessionof the Paramaras till A.D. 1117, as 
an unpublished iuBcr.ptum found tliere shows.1 One of the inscriptionslabB of Kumbhakarn* oricrinally found at the templeof Mamfuleva at KnmalgadU*informs us that the Guhilot prince Kumarasimha expelled Kitu, who had occupiedhis country. In all the Somgara chronicles Kirtipala is called Kitu, and Kmuarasiiiiha was only two generations prior to the 
Guhilot chief Jaitrasirhha for whom ve have dates ranging from A.D. 1213-1252. Kumiira sirhha can thns very well bo a contemporaryof the Chaharmma Kirtipala, who must, therefore, be supposed to have carried an expeditionof conquestin the Guhilofc territory. 
Kirtipala had at least thi-ee sons and oue daughter. Of the three sons, one was Samara sirhlia who succeeded him, and the other two were Lakhanapalha (or -pala) and Abhayapala mentioned in No. XV as the jeLgird-irs of Sinanava or Sairmanaka, which, I think, has to be identified with Sonant S0na.ua,it will be remembered, was one of tlio villages grantedto Kirtipala by Alhanadeva, and Kirtipalafarther seems to have made it over duringhis brother's regime to two of his sons. The name of his daughter was Budaladevi, who, accordingto the Snndha hill inscription, built two templesto Siva at Jabalipura ( Jiilsr). 
After Kirtipala, his aon Samarasimha, as stated above, became ting. Two inscriptionsof this prince have been found at Jalfir (Nos. XV11I and XIX). One of these is dated in V.E. 1239 and the other V.E. 1242. The Sflndha hill inscription swysthat he built extensive ramparts on the Kanakachala. In the second of the Jalor epigraphs just Minded to, the follow ing words occur : M-JdMipunya-Kafnr.hitnagiri'ga^hasy-opari,etc. tfrom this it ia plain that Kamchanagiri or Kanakachala was the name of the hill, on which tho fort of Jalflr is situated, When Kirtipala carved ont a kingdom for himself, he established his capitalat JalOr, whose fortiacationa Were commenced by him. Bat as he did not live long after it, this work had to be carried ont by his son Samarasiiiha. The Snndha hill inscription also speaksof him as having weighed himself against gold and having afterwards founded the cityof Samarapura, which has not yet been identified. A copper-plate charter of the Chauliikya sovereign Bhimadeva II., dated V.E. 1^63, makes mention of his queen Liladevi, who is spokenof as Clidliif ranci Samarasiliasutg.* t.e, the daughterof the Chohan ram Sarnarasiha. Professor Kielhorn was the first to identifyhitn with the Marwar Chiibamana kingof that name. 
The Snndhfi hill inscription representshie ton Udayasimha to have encceoded Samara simha. Bnt Udayasimha was not his eldest son, because a Mount Abu inscription epeaksof Manavasimha, who is called a son of Samarasimha and the elder brother of Udayasimha.4 Up to the time of Samaras! riiha, the powerof the Sonigara family had been confined to the Jalor District and the territory intervening between it and Kiradfl. And it was Udayasiriiha who greatly extended these dominions, which now included the districts originally held bythe Nadoliya branch. For, in the Suadha hill inscription, amongst the places held by him, Waddnla {Nadol) is distinctly mentioned. The other places named are Javalipnra, Mandavyapura, Vagbhatameru, Surachanda, Ratahrada, Kheda, Ramasainya, Srlmala, Eatnapuraand Batyapura. Almost all these places have been identified byProfessor Kielhorn. Javalipnra is Jalor, Mandavyapura Mandor, 6 miles north of Jodhpur ; Vagbhatamera is Bjidrner, not

TEE CHAHAMANAS OF MABWAR,   
V.E. 1326. It was found by me at Sevadi, but was originally lyingat Kareda in Mewar, doubt less Karaheda mentioned therein. No less than three of his records have been discovered at Bhinmal, with the dates V.E. 1328, 1333 and 1334. In the last inscription are mentioned his brolhers Vahadaslha and Chanmndaraja, the last of whom has, as we have already seen, been referred to in the Sandha hill inscription. 
Prom an inscription originally found at Budhatra but now deposited at the Ajmer museum it appearsthat Chachigadevaor Chaeha, as he is there called, had a queen named Lakshmidevi from whom he had a daughter called RupadevL1 The lateat date we have for Chachigadevais V.E, 1334, and after it we find inscriptionsof a king who is named Samamtasimha, Samvata simha or Samyantasimha with dates ranging from V.E. 1339 to 1353. Unfortunately no epigraph has been found which tells us how he was related to his predecessor Chachigadeva. But all the bardic chronicles that I have seen in Marwar are unanimous in sayingthat Samamta sirhha was a son of Chachigadeva, He was thus a brother of Rupadevi, to whose reign'her inscription belongs. The last of Saroamtasimha's records dated V.E. 1353 is interesting (No. XXIII). It expressly refers itself to the conjoint reignof Samamtasimhadeva and Kanhada deva, The same thing is done in another inscription found at Chohtan and noted in con-* neotion with No. XXIII. Bardic chronicles tell us that the latter was a son of the former. Kanhadadeva must, therefore, have been ywvaraja or heir-apparent since V.E. 1353, the date of the latter inscription. No inscription has as yet come to lightof this prince when he was on the throne. But he is twice referred to in the Tawsrikh-i-Fvrishtah. While speakingof the conquests, in A.D, 1304, of Ein-ool-Moolk Mooltany, a chieftain of Ala-ud-DIn, it Says: " Nehr Dew, Raja of Jalwar, panic-struckat the rapid progressof Ein-ool-Moolk, surrendered that place without opposition."2 I am informed by Munshi Devi Prasad that for" Nehr Dew" the published Persian test of the Taw&ri'kh'i-Firisktiih has Gatar Dev, which, with a slight .change of diacritical marks, can be read Kanir De>. Kanir Dev of Jalwar can be no other than Kanhadadeva, son of Sa'mamtasimha, of Jalor. For about four years he remained a feudatoryof Ala-ud-Dm. The account of his death and the capture of Jalor are givenin the same work as follows :tIt is related that the Raja of Jalwar, Nehr Dew (Kanir Dev),as has been stated above, resided at the court of Dehly. One day the king was boasting, that at the present day no raja of Hindoostan dared to opposehis arms ; on which Nehr Dew, in the plenitudeof folly, "I will suffer death, if I do not myself raise an army that shall defeat any attemptof the 
replied, 
king's troops to take the fort of Jalwar." The king directed him to quit the court, and finding he was collecting troops, ordered a division of the army to besiege Jalwar; and the more to show his contempt for Nehr Dew, placedthe troops under the command of one of the slave girls of the palace, called G-ool Behisbt "the Rose of Heaven." She evinced great bravery and nearly succeeded in taking the fort, but she fell sick and died. The siege was then conducted by her son Shaheen. Nehr Dew quitted the fort and attacking the royal army, slew Shaheen, with his own hand, and the Mahomedans retreated four days successively towards Dehly. AUa-ood-Deen, vexed at this repulse, sent strong reinforcements nnder Kumal-ood-Deen, a generalof dis tinction, who succeeded at last in taking Jalwar by storm, and made a dreadful slaughter of the garrison, putting Nehr Dew and his familyto the sword, and plunderingall his treasures. The news of this event created great joyat the capital."3 The exact date of this event is nob specified in the Tawarikh-i-FirisUdn, but the latter implies that it must have come to pass shortly before A.D. 1309. 
According to the chronicle of Muta MensI, which is looked uponas of the highest authority throughout Marwar, Cbachigade had three sons, ?. Sarhvataal ESval, Chahadade", ind Chamdra. Samvatasi's son was Kanhadade, who was the lord of Jal5r and was also

:t e ( Un V.B 13<'S, Jinaprabbasuri,anther of the TutMa , tells us tha o t mploo!MahavIraatSatyapura(SaSoh5r) was polluted by Ala-nd-Dln, army and the inJc c-u-ried off in V.E. 1307, As Sanchor i B not far off from JalOr,it is notunreasonable to 'upnos,thiil the army,which capturedJalflr, polluted the templeof filfiohOr also. And as the su-kuf this Jaim fane occurred in the lifetime of Jinaprabhasuri,the date given bylum must !/ acceptedae correct, Between this aud the date of the captureof Jalflr given by Muto fei, the Oitterenceis but one year,which is of no consequence, for, as we learn from the TaMfMi-i-FirislA the siegeof JalCr lasted for a long time, and it is possible that, while the do-* continued a detachment of the army proceededto SSnchOr for pillaging the temple whose fame must have spreadall over southern Mai-war. The date 1368 V,B.=l31l A.D. may thus bo taken to be the yearwhen the fort of Jalflr fell into the hands of Ala-ud-Din. 
Mutii Ncnsi saysthat, when Jalflr was on tho pointof being taken, Kanhadadeva managed to send off his brother Maladeva from the fort in order that the Sonigara family might not be completely destroyed. Maladeva continued to live a migratorylife for some time, but soon succeeded in winningthe favour of the Muhammadan emperor, who was pleasedto assign to him the fort of Chitflr which remained in his possessioafor seven years.After describing the flightof the Guhilot prince Batnasirhha from Delhi,the TawUnkli-i-FmsUah say as follows: "At length, findingit of no use to retain Chittoor, the kingordered tho Prince Khizr Khan to ovacuate it, and to make it over to the nephew (sister's son)of the Raja. The Hindu prince, in a short time, restored the principalityto its former condition, and retained tic tract of Chittoor as tributaryto Alla-ood-Deen daringthe rest of nig reign. He sent annually large sums of money,besides valuable presents, and always joined the imperial standard in the fold with 5,000 horse and 10,000 foot."1 Abool Eazal, in his Ain-i-Aklan, gives the same account, but mentions Maldeva as the name of the Hindu prince. Maladeva is mention* -dby Tod also in connection with the fall of Chit5rgadh, with regardto which he says that Ala-ud Din '' delivered tha city in chargeto Maldeo, the chief of Jhalor, whom he had conquereduud enrolled amongsthie vassals."2 MutS Nensi tells us that Maladeva had three sons, viz. Jeso, Kitapala and Vanavira, Of JesO we know absolutely nothing, As regards Kltapiila, hu may perhapsbe the same as the Chahumana Sri-Kituka, whom together with Ala-ad- Dlti, HupBhuvanasimha is representedto have conqueredin the Ranpur inscription.3Variavlra, the third son of Maladeva is no doubt the Mahar&jadhmja, Sri-Vanavlradeva of the Eflt-Solan kiyii inscription (No. XXIV), dated V.E. 1394 (A,D. 1338), Both Maladeva and Vanavira are referred to by Tod whilespeaking about the marriageof the widowed daughterof the former with Eana Hammira. Tod has also described how, with the helpof Ms wife and a scribe whom he had obtained as partof the dower, Hammira succeeded in making himself mastor of his ancestral fort, ChitOr. He furtheraaysthat"Bunbeer, the son of Maldco, offered to serve Hamir, who assignedthe districts of Neemutch, Jeeran, Ruttunpur, and tho Kairar, to maintain the familyof his wife in becoming dignity Bunbeer shortly after carried Bhynsrore by assault, and this ancient possession guardingthe Chumbul was again added to Mewar." It is impossibletosay how far this account, based solely oa bardic chronicles, is true. It is indeed curious bow Gedvad, whichcomprises K5t-Solankiya where Vapavira's inscription was found,is not mentioned amongstthe provinces assignedto him by Ha'tnmln. It i olio

86 EPIGKAPEIA INDIOA. [VOL. XI.   
The inscription has suffered so much damage that we can form no opinion as to what its purport was after the opening partof it. Its interest lies in the point that it is a Hthic record of a king, the Svamin Virasena, who may be identified with practical certainty with a king Virasena of whom we have coins. Professor Rapson haa deaoribed and figured one of the coins in the Jour. E, As. Soc., 1900, p, 115, and notes there certain symbols on it which have some general resemblance (but nothing specific except the tree) with the symbols on this stone. And Mr. V, Smith has described fourteen of them, and figured two, in hia Catalogue of Coins in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, p. 197, and conjecturesthere (p. 191 .) from the provenance of them that Virasena was a king in the Gangetic Doab about A.D. 300. 
The record is dated in the thirteenth regnal year of Virasena,1 and on the eighth day in the fourth fortnight of the hot season, As no yearof an era ia given and the dafce of Virasena is not known,, we can only fix on palsaograpaic grounds the period to which the record may be referred ; and the following remarks are offered towards elucidatingthis point. The letters that occur clearly are U} g, t, n, p, m, y, r, v, sh and stand they may be compared with the Brahmi forms in Tables II and III in Biihler's Indische Palceographie. The facts to be ascertained must be, not what are the earliest records with which letters found in this inscrip tion tally, for particular forms, such for instance as those of k and n, persisted with little or no modification for several centuries, but rather what was the period when any later or new forms found in this inscription came into use.2 The forms of certain of these letters, namely, m, y, v, and sli do not occur in Table II and are first found in Table III; hence these letters deserve most notice and attention may be confined to Table III. The form of m resembles most those in columns VI and VIII of that table; that of y those in columns I, II, IX and Xin that of t? those in columns I and VIII ; and that of sh the form in column XIV. The forma of y and? are therefore found ia inscriptions varying in date from the 1st century B.O, to the 2nd century A.D.j that of m in the 1st and 2nd centuries A. D.; and that of sh not until the second century A.D. The most significant therefore of these letters is sh, and its form shews that the inscription cannot be earlier than the 2nd century A.D. There are two other features which point to a somewhat later period. First, the mark for the long vowel 5, in the letters portrayed in Table III, is formed by a short horizontal bar drawn to the right from the head of a con sonant, but hare the bar always shows a slight curve upwards a tendency that became more pronounced in one form of this vowel m the later Gupta alphabet. Secondly, the heads of the letters iu this inscription are slightly, yet quite distinctly, wedge-shaped, and this feature also became well developed in the Gupta alphabet. It would therefore appear that this record should be assigned to a time later than the secondcentury, that ia, to the 3rd century A.D,, and very possibly to the latter part of it; and this agrees with Mr. V. Smith's conjeoto regarding Virasena's age, mentioned above.

In the year 10 (and} 3 of SvSmin Virasena, in the fortnight 4 of the hot season,3 on the day 8 
No, 7.-TWO RECORDS ON THE PILLAR AT KOSAM. 
BY F. E. PABGITBR, M.A., I.C.S, (RETD.) 
The two following inscriptions were noticed by General Sir A. Cunningham in his description of the pillar at Kosam in his Archssological Surveyof India, Vol, I, p, 310. Ink impressions of them were sent me byDr. Fleet which he received from Dr. Konow, and at his request I have written this paper on them. 
A. A verse of the 7th or 8tli century, A.D. 
This is described by General Cunningham thus*." The next inscription in pointof time consists of six lines in characters of the 6th or 7th century. As this record is placed on the lower part of the shaft, from 3 to 4 feet beneath the present ground level, and as the lines are perpendicular to the sides of the shaft, I infer that at the time when it was inscribed, the pillar 
was still standing upright in its original position, and that the surrounding buildings were Btill in perfect order. This inference is fully borne out "by Hweu Thflang'u account,eto." It is written in the Gupta character of the latter partof the 7th century. The letters are large and somewhat irregularly formed, varying from 1| to Ifinches in height. The language is Sanskrit, and the compositionis a verse in the u<pendravajr& metre written in four linea with the author's name added in the fifth and sixth lines. But the engraver has marred the ap pearance of the verse by the manner in which he has inscribed it. The first line contains the first p&da of the verae, but in consequenceof his making the Bret 8 aksharas of the second line some what small and close he gotinto it not onlythe second pada but also the first 3 aksharas of the third pcida. The third line then contains the remainder of the third <pa,da and the first 3 aksharas of the fourth $ada; and the fourth line, receiving onlythe remaining8 afoharas of that $a.da, looks not only incomplete but also erroneous in beginningwith the word cha. Con sequently also the metre appears faulty and the meaning is obseure'd. When properly adjusted the (ipctos read aright and the metre is correct. The end of the second line is ornamented with a ppouliar scroll, in which the symbolfor the vowel i in the final ti has been, continued in a line which bends around beneath the letter t, ascends on its right and finishes in a right laanded curve further to the right. The incorrect structure of the lines suggests an explanation of this scroll. The porbionof the scroll alongthe right side of the letter t IB an uprightline. The first half of the verse ends with stt-<toj/arf, but the engraver, thinking that it ended with 
1 This ofaAaro, judging from what remains of it and ffom the space which it occupies, would seem to be a double coaaonant, of which Icli, oh or c is the second member. It may perhaps be at>a or svdt a The fourth fortnight of the hob eason would he the last fortnightof it, if we should reckon six seasons in the year, and would be (for the time of oar record) about the first half of Jane with the year of three seasons thii fortnight would be about the first half of April,
gg EPIQRAPHIA DTDIOA. [VOL, XI.   
the second line, put tlie usual bar there, and the mistake -was rectified by turning the bar into a meaningless scroll, continuingits lower portion backward beneath the t into the vowel i and its upper portion forward in the curve to the right. There was not sufficient room to insert the single bar after gu'dkiryamtbut the double bar at the close of the verse occurscorrectly at the end of the fourth line. 
The letters are of the Gupta character and resemble' most closely those of the Aphsad inscription of about A.D. 675, portrayed byBiihler in his Jndische Palceographie, Table IV, cole. XYUI and XIX (especially the former), with a tendencyin some cases towairds theshapes in the Multai inscription of A,B. 708-9, and of the Dighwa-Dubauli inscription of A.D, 761-2, cols. XX and XXI in that Table, such as the dh (1, 2), At the same time some of the letters have the earlier forms found in the Kahaum inscriptionof A.D. 459, col, V in that Table, such as I and bh (1. 1), v (1, 3),^(11. 4 and 5) and fc (1. 6), though k also appearsin its form in col. XVIH in the fourth line. The n has a peculiar shape, an upright line with a horizontal bar at taohed to its left side, as in pun&ti (1. 2), and Indra, (1. 4), thus approximatingto its modern form. The inscription may therefore be assignedto the end of the 7th or the beginning of the 8th century, A,D. 
Cunningham inferred from Hiuen Tsang's account of this spot that this pillar was stand ing erect at that traveller's visit there during the early part of the 7th century in Harsha's reign, and' the manner in which he saysthis verse is engraved (quoted above) shows that the pillar was also erect when it was engraved, which appearsto have been at the end of that century or the beginning of the 8th century. He says the pillaris a Bnddhist structure, and the earliest inscription which it bears is an incomplete record which he ascribes to the 4th or 5th century,1 Buddhism must have retained its possession of this spot during Harsha's reign, for Mr, V. Smith says(< fiarsha himself distributed his devotions among the three deities of the family, Siva, the Sun and Buddha ; . . . , But, in his later years, the Buddhist doctrines held 
the chief place in his affections; and the eloquence of the Chinese Master of the Law induced him to prefer the advanced teaching of the Mahayana sect to the more primitive Hinayana doctrine of the Sammitlya school with which he had been familiar previously,"2 The question arises whether thi& verse half a century or more later is a Buddhist or brahmanioal inscription.I am not sure whether the reference to Indra's world could be a Buddhist beatitude. It seems more like a brahmanio benediction, and this is supported by the facts that the verse is in Sanskrit and that the author's: name is Sankha-dgva, which might be a synonym for Vishnu. If then this yerae be a brahmanical inscription, may we infer that it marks the time1 when Brahmanism usted Buddhism from this spot?

The composition of Sankha-deva. 
B. An inscription of A.D. 1565. 
This is described as two inscriptions by General Sir A. Cunningham in the following words s:"This [that is, a brief record o Akbar's time] is followed by a short record of a soni, or goldsmith, in three lines, below which ia a long inscription dated in Samvat 1621, or A.D 1564), in the early partof Akbar's reign, detailing the genealogyof a whole familyof goldsmiths. It is in this inscription that the name Eosilmbipura occurs, the founder of the family, named Anand Bam Das, havingdied at Kosam." He thus pronouncedthe first three lines of this record to be one inscription and the remainder a separate inscription, but they appearto me to be one, for the followingreasons. First, the style of the writingis exactly the same throughout. Secondly,the space between Srl-Ganesakiu line 1 and Samlat 1621 in line 4 is merely the size of a single row of letters and is just about the interval that would 
ordinarily be left between the invocation to a deity and the body of the composition. The remainder of line 1 and lines 2 and S have been inserted by curvingthe writing upwards to the right BO aa to widen out the spaceto the right between lines 1 and 4 : thus there is just room for the word mukha between lan&n in line 1 and samaai in line 45 and as lines 1 and 2 curve away upwards? room is found to insert dev Bhairav beneath darpan sanlrika and above the end of line 4. The whole inscription looks as if it had been written at first thus Sn-GanesaTt as the heading and then Sambai; 1621, etc., to the end; and as if the -words banan to d?v Bhairav had been added afterwards, the writing being curved upwards so as to make room for these latter words in the manner described above. Thirdly,if lines 1-3 constituted a separate inscription, there was no reason to curve the writing, whether it were written before or after lines 4-18 I because, if written before, there would have been a clear space and the inscription would naturally have been written compactlyin two or three straightlines conform ably to its invocation ;and if written afterwards, it would have been placed higher (for there is sufficient unused space above) and then written straight similarly. Fourthly,if lines 1-3 constituted a separate composition,it contains no personal name but merelyrefers vaguelyto the "city goldsmiths";whereas, if the whole is one inscription, the addition in lines 1-3 would be a natural after-thoughtas a prefaceto the subsequent names and in order to record a prayer to Bhairava on behalf of them collectively. No argumentcan be based on* the fact that the prayer to Bhairava follows the invocation to Ganesa, because the invocation and the prayer are in one and the same inscription accordingto either theory. Lastly, the inscription seems when read as a whole,to givea better sense than when treated as two separate composi tions-^ point referred to more particularly at the end of this article. 
The inscription ia written in characters, well-made and about f inchhigh,^which (that ia, such of them as occur) have a close resemblance to ordinary Mgarf. The cine puzzleoccur, n the letter rt, which, if read as such, produces meaningless words The keyto explaintlu* difficult lies in the fact that in the modern vernacular of UpperInd,a this letter, when non- "and uncompounded,is very commonly pronounced M; thus, jmru*a man , appears 
wl ' a rlBbi'as nfcW and nfcfr, tushar,< mist, frost ',as tukJM, and so on. This Sha S ; "ppe- to have' been so generallyestablished, that the character it extreseion, though certainly peculiar.It is not, however, stranger than varies 
KavyaTuIL^e, and the author * limited in hi. choice of words by the metre.

for it is used here nniformlyto expresskh,1 The proper character for kh seems to l>c* which is used only once, namely,in the word Lakhimi (=LakshmI) in line 7, and ^- approximates to the form of kh'm Bengali.3Everywhere else kh is expressed bythe character^,: sh;and this is done whether kh represents an original sh&s in the word purukh (1. 9), or wliothcr it is a genuine kh as in the words mukha (1. 2) and likhlte (1, 5), or whether it represonts rm original ksh aa in tho words Lakhmanu (1. 5), khema (1. 8), and Laltliiml (1. 17). Wl<'i; this peculiarity is observed, the inscription becomes intelligible. 
The inscription ia in the vernacular. No distinction is made between the sibilants ,s' and /.-, and both are written ass, thus, Mahesa appearsaa Mahesa (1. ]1) arid Kaufomb* as KautnitnH (1. 7), &nA Sri'tianrtab as Srl-Ganesah (1. 1). Similarly*& when compounded is written ^ as in Baitnav for Baishnwa (1. 6, and 15-18). Nor is any distinction made between cerebral and dental nasals (with oue exception), thus, darpana appears aa da^pan (1. 2\ kripawtas fcrajwn (1, 8) and Baishnava as 2fetsna, The one exception occurs in the invocation .SVi Ga&sab and the scribe's knowledge was so faulty that, though he has written the n rigI it, has tnraed the A; twice into 5. It seems possible further that he did not distinguish between tla other cerebral and dental letters, for Olumumda (1. 13) looks as if obtained from Oh&mtwttfa. 
The character fort; appears in its ordinary Nagaji form and also with a dot benekth it. The latter form occurs only at the end of words, as in dev Bhairav (1. 3) and Baisnav (11. C>, and 15-1S). In words ending in m, tho. in the present vernaculars drops its inherent a and IB commonly pronounced with a vo wel sound like w or o, thus, deva becomes dew or deo. Tho dottmi 
form therefore appears to represent v (with that sound), and the undotted form no doubt r* spiv- *ent^, as seems clear from its use in the name Kausamli (1. 7), the ancient form of which in alw*y8 Kausambi in Sanskrit writings, and also in the word lanan (1. 1), which is obviously a 
corrodingto the existing verb IM^ (Hindi) and tena-ite (Bengali), 'to maL,fabncate/ and m which the mitial b is so well established that no form with an initial ,? vci

'"vs5X2ar*- -...No. 7,] TWO RECORDS Otf THE PILLAR AT KOSAM. 91   
The words sonara (1, 5) and sonl (1. 1, 1015) deserve notice as they appear to be distin guished. Though the signatories are mentioned collectivelyas sonis (1. 1), yet those who sign as soms are definitely stated to be the purukh, 'men,' that is workmen, of Lakshman sonara and of four other persons to whose names uo descriptionis added. Sonara, therefore seems to be a higher term than soni, and if sonl designates the workman, sonara, must obviously mean the master or employer ; so that, if the former is translated 'goldsmith/ the latter should be ren dered ( master goldsmith.* SoniyS in Hindi means' one who separates gold from ashes, etc., in the mint,' but there appears to be no word in Hiudi correspondingto sonars, unless it be sotiar or sun&r, the ordinary term for a goldsmith. 
As regards the personal names, the inscription shows that much the same custom obtained in the sixteenth century as prevails now in using names shortly, familiarly or colloquially. The vowel u was often substituted for a final a, thus we find Lakhimanu (1. 5), Naltgu (1. 10), Eatanu (1. 14) and Anadu (1. 16, 18).1 Lakhimanu -would be the colloquial form of Lakhiman, that is, Lakshmana ;and Ratanu of some name beginning with Ratna, such as Hatnadatta or Eatnachandta. Anadn may be short for An-nada, and the full name might be Annada-d&s or Annada-prasad. Birti (1, 6)is probably short for some name beginning with britti, that is, vritti. Laghu (1. 8) ms,y=Eaghu,the letters r and I being frequently interchanged in the colloquial ;and the full name might be Raghu-n&th. Ohamanda (1. 13) eeems to pointto some name like Oh^mund^-d^s, and Chamdild (1. 15)to Ohandresa or Qhandireia,. Dhane (1. 15) is no doubt short for Dhanea or Dhanesvara;and Karam (1. 16) may be abbreviated from Karam Oh&nd (=Karma- chandra).I cannot resolve Sorll (1. 12)or ManS (1. 17), nor NaUgu or its variants (1. 10) ;but Eorila-simlia is givenas a name in Monier-Williama' Dictionary. 
As regards the date of this record, Dr. Elect observes as follows :"It is not capable of actual verification, because the inscription does not include the weekday or some other detail necessary to that end. Bat, with the year taken as the expired year and the month as the gurnimanta month, in both respectsin accordance with, the practice which prevailed generally at that time in the locality to which the record belongs, the equivalent of the given details, (Vikrama)-samvat 1621, Ohaitra vadi 5, is 20 February A.D. 1665." 
It appears from this examination that the purport of the inscription differs from Sir A. Cunningham's surmise. It shews that five leading goldsmiths with thirteen of their employes put up this address to Ganesa and Siva-Bhairava for favour to the goldsmithsof Kausamhltown. Only three of the leading goldsmiths belonged to that town, and two were strangers apparently. The fact that these two are named first suggeststhat they were men of more importance than the three residents, and perhaps they were gold-merchantsrather than goldsmiths. One of these two was a Vaishnava and so were four of the employes, yet they also joined in this invocation to GaneSa and Siva-Bhairava. Surely no ordinaryoccasion would have oaueed all these men, that is the whole local guild of goldsmiths,to joinin recording such an inscription on this pillar. At that time, early in 1565, several of Akbar'e chief nobles and commandere had revolted against Him, hostilities were still going on, and the whole country from Delhi to Allahabad must have been itx a lawless condition. Kaugambi was presumablya town of no greatsize or strength then, and its goldsmiths as men of some wealth must have been in dangerof extortion orpillageat the hands of the soldiery. In snoh circumstances' was it: not natural that they should invoke Gangfo as the god of wisdom, and praythat Siva-Bhairava, the terrible godof destruction, would display to them a face calm and brightas a mirror ? 
Lastly, it is particularly worthyof notice that this record mentions Kosam as Kausariibj, that is KauSSmbi, at a period longbefore the time when archaeologists began to identify the -place with the Kausambi, KOsamhi, of the Sanskrit and Buddhist books. 
ipfcfe praqtice seems to have been prevalentin Bajputana alreadyin the 12th century A.D, j see Mr. Bhandarkar's remarks on p. 38 above. Ed,]N 2

8.] THREE COPPEE-PLATE EECOEDS OF SONPUR. 93   
No. 8. THREE COPPER-PLATE RECORDS OF SONPUR. 
BY B. C. MAZTJMDAR, B.A., B.L., M.B.A.S., SAMBALPUB. 
The three copper-platecharters which I now publish were all found in the Feudatory State of Sonpur, attached to the district of Sambalpur. It was in the year 1898 that I deciphered them, as well as another charter which was found at Satalma (called Satallama in the iuscrip tion) in the same district. Mr. Slocock, the then Deputy Commissioner of Sambalpur, who gave me the Satalma charter to get deciphered, took it back from me with the transliteration and translation of its text, and forwarded it to the Museum at Nagpur.1 
In the sequel I shall have to refer to the Satalma platesas well as the copper-plate charters of the Somavamsi kings of Katak which have been edited byDr. Fleet,2 For convenience of reference, the subjoined three inscriptions will be denoted by the letters A, B and C, respect ively ;the Satalma plates by S; and the records published byDr, Fleet by F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4, F5andF6. 
As regards orthography, there are two pointsto be noticed before I proceedto deal with the individual inscriptions. The vowel n was pronounced as ri and not as r, as it is now done, by the inhabitants of Sambalpur and Orissa; see, e.g. pravritafor pravritta, (C, 1. 15), riSaya for rishayah (0, 1. 25). A few similar cases have also been noticed in the Satalma3grant and 
in the Kudopali plates.4Triltalitiga occurs for Trikalinga (A, 1, 4jF 1,1. 3) and JUsikesa, for Hrishvkesa (Fl, 1. 15). There was onlyone letter current to denote both v and 6. Owing to the fact that I is the pronunciation for both of them in Bengal and Orissa,it cannot Toe said that v is nsed wrongly for 6:or vice versa. 
A. Vakratentali charter of Mahabhavagupta I. 
These are three plates (of four sides),of which the first and last are written on the inner eides only. They are narrower at the margins than in the middle. The height varies from. 4^-" to 4|" and the breadth from 8f"to 9". The platesare strung together on a nearly circular ring, 1H" in diameter and f"thick, which is passed through circular holes cut on the left margin of each, plate at a distance of about j" from the edge. The ends of the ringare secured into the 
lower portion of a lump of copper which bulgesout on either side along the ring for a space of 1|", La addition to this, a copper pin appearsto have been driven through the lump of copper, 'In the upper portion of this lump is a deep impression, nearly circular, about 2" in diameter. 
Here is the figure of a goddessin relief, squatting apparently on a lotus, flanked on each side by an elephant with its trunk uplifted. The elephant on the leffc side is not quite distinct. Close to it is a ranch defaced legend. I have read it tentativelyas Sri-Janmejayadeva 
[rajasya ?]. Consideringthat the legends on most of the seals of this family are illegible and have not been deciphered,this reading must be looked uponas a mere conjecture. The plates belong to the time of the Paramdbhatt&raka MaftarajatfTwaja Paramesvara gri-Mababhavaguptarajadeva, who meditated on the feet of the P. M> P. Sri-givaguptadeva. The king is described as the most devout worshipperof Siva (paramamahesvara), the forehead ornament of the lunar race and the lord of Trikalinga, The grant was issued from the camp of victory pitched at Suvarnapura. In line 36, the date is givenas the third year of the victorious reign of the JP. M. P. Sri-Janamejayadeva. This is the earliest known record of Mahabhavagupta L as well as of the Somavamsi kingsof Katak, as no inscriptions of his father

3STo. 8.] THREE COPPER-PLATE RECORDS OF, SOETPUR. 99   
One of the Bamanghati plates1 is dated in Samvat 288 and during1 the reignof Eanabhanja, eoxi of Digbhanja and grandsonof Kottabhanja of the Bhanja family,3 while the other belongs -to the time of Rajabhanja, son of Eanabhanja, and grandson of Kottabhanja of the- Bhanja family.8 In the Gumsnr plates, the donor is Hetribhafija, son of Ranabhanjaand grandsonof The followingtentative genealogy may be derived from these four records : 
Kottabhanja 
Digbhanja (alias Satrubhanja ?). 
Ranabhanja 
Digbhanja NetribnaSja 
( (Kalyanakalasa) 
Silabhanjadeva 
I 
Maharaja Vidyadharabhanja. 
Dhamnakalada 
The subjoined grantis dated during the reignof gatrubhanja, bat I doubt if it has to be Assigned to the first king on the foregoingtentative genealogy.I would rather assignit to some successor of Vidyadharabhanja on the above table, The emblems on the seal may be taken to 3"how that Satrubhanja was a Saiva. But in line 16 of the text he is described as a fervent levotee of the god Viahnu (parama-vaishnava), The modern representativesof the Bhafija -.&* roily are the ralers of the native state of Morbhanj in Orissa, which probably owes its name ;o a king named Mayurabhanja. The indirect reference to this kingin the present grantin the epithet andaja-vamfa-prabhavais to my mind satisfactory evidence of the donor Satrubhanja Carving lived at a comparativelylater period. In the two BamanghJiti plates mention is made > Virabkadra, the founder of the Bhaiija family, who is said to have been born in the great -a,2povana at Kotyasrama by breaking opena pea-hen's egg.4

In order to localise and identify the places mentioned in the foregoingthree grants and other allied inscriptions we must try and ascertain bow and where the originals were found. A and B as well as S were discovered by cultivators while ploughing fields in the villages granted by the charters. As regards Mihipadi Khandaksbetra of C, Milupadi or Milupandi may bo the name of a plot of land. All fields in the district of Sambalpur as well as in the feudatory states attached to it bear local names;and if Khandakshetra denoted merely a stray piece of land, no identification of it is possible. But Khandakshetra may also be the name of a village ; for in F 1, line 13, we actuallyfind the word as the name of a village. The resident of that village is Baid to have come from Odayasringa, which I identify with Odsinga in the native state of Atmallik. Eoyara beingon the borders of Sonpur State (0, line 21), not far off either from Patna or Atmallik, there might have been a village of the name Khandakshetra in the locality where the record was unearthed. 
It must be noted that the states of Rerhakhol, Atmallik, Bodh and Patna lie to the north, north-east, east aud south, respectively, of the Sonpur State which they adjoin. Of the geographical names mentioned in F 1, the river Ohga (now called Ong) flows through the states of Patna and Sonpur. The Zammdari of Barpali (district Sambalpur)in which the village Satallama the modern Satalma of S is situated,is also witbin a few miles from the river Ong 
flowing past Saleohata, Bakebira and Loisihga (Vakavedda and LeiMnga of F 1) are also close to Salebhata Police Station. 
Nuptara Nupursinga and Banktentuli (IwpoWcwffi Khandiya Vdkratentali grume, line 5, A) are in the neighbourhoodof the place where A was obtained. As Suvarnapura (A, line 1} is certainly the Sanskritiaed form of Sonpur, so also is Eadhaphamvallikandara (A, line 12),

uiui vulgar Bengali. 
Bluiasima (P 1, line 1 and S, line 2) appearsto be Mursing which, is in theJarasinga 7' iTi of the Patui State. The situation of Satalma, Bakebira and Loisinga,led me first to mtSLtiecation! My impressionie confirmed bythe fact that it is customary with the Xvnmd-ir of Janism-a to be ceremoniouslyinstalled every yearon the Dasara dny (lUth day 
fi-om the full moon of the month of Asm) by goingto Mnrsing, which is at present quite an 
insignificant village. 
There is no doubt that when A was issued, the donor was presentat Sonpnr. The word 
nkw-katrfu in li" e 1 of tlie P^copPer'Plate Smt ( P> *)> like ^yo-shmikilvara (A, line 1j, occurring as it does after the name of the place where the king was residing,01111 never mean a town."From Murasima (or from Suvarnapura,as the case may bo) whero theking with his victorious soldiers was encamped"should be the meaningof the first Hue of the text of both F 1 and A. 
It is very probablethat a town was beingbuilt at Chaudwjir, on the bank of ilia Mahanadi opposite Katak,either by Janamejayaor his eon Yayati ;but it was uovor finished. Dr. Fleet has very rightly remarked (above, Vol III, 324) that the town Katak in of latororigin than Chaudwar. If this be the case, how could the placeattain any celebrity alreadyin the time of Janamejaya? It may be that the town Katak owes its name to the fact of its being built on a camping ground. As the king must have encampedin many different places, it is impos sible that the name Kataka had at such ati early periodas the reign of Janamujaya, become the proper name of the localityto which it is now applied. Dr. Fleet saw clearly what the word meant,1 but was onlymisled bythe name of the town where theplates edited by him were pre served. Since it is clear that the Sonpur charters were issued from Sonpur, there- is no reason to suppose that the chartersrelating to Bakebira (F 1) and Satalma (S) not far from one an other were not issued from some placein Patna duringthemilitary expedition of thegrantor, 
I am inclined to think that the town "Vinitapura, whence Mahasivagupta issued B grant ing the villageof Mbinna, is no other than BinikS in the Sonpur State, Tho villages Nibinna and Menda (now a police station) are in the Binika subdivision, From the source of the river to the Bay of Bengal there ia no other town ou the bank of the Mahanadi which bears such a name. Consideringthat even villages veryoften retain their old names, it is not likely that a town of such importance has lost its name altogether. For this ream I think Vimtapura is the banskrifased form of the non-Aryan name Binika. 
It is apity that theoriginal find-spotof P 5 cannot now be known. How tbe charter rctog to avillage the Zosala 
was not atcUtry was carried to the Government record Irn t Kat all uqmrek into by BabuRangalal Banerji when ho first edited it in 1877 I In easaly mmgine how ihe charters

convenience due to their geographicalsituation. It is perfectly clear that this tract of country -firas also once included within Kosala-desa or Dakshina Kosala of which Katanpur (in the district of Bilaspur) was the capital, but did not form any part of Odra or Grissa. For,in the first place, Nihinna in Sonpur (B,lines 4, 5, 15 and 10) and Ssitullarua (modern Satalum)in 
Sambalpur (S, line 9) are described as villages in Kosala-desa.1Secondly, the Bralniiana wlo came from Orissa to he settled in the district of Sambalpur, could nyt Lmve been culled a man of Odra-desa (S, lines 16 and 17) if the district were partoE Orissa. It is worthyof note tut even now, when anybody goesto Puri on pilgrimage,either from Samba'pror fiom the feada 
tory states, he says he is goingto Orissa. In popular language.Orissa does not include Sambalpur and its feudatorystates. 
The grantors of the charters F 1 to F 6, A, B, and S, called themsi'lvt* lords of Kosala desa2 SB well as of Trikalihga. It is worthyof note tlmt the Kesari kte> fire counted in OriBsa from Yayati and not from his father Janamejaya. Tlure is aiMth.-r Jauamejayain the list of kings, but he was a remote successor of Yayiiti. Mcivlylu-eausu no epigrapbie record of Jauamejaya has been obtained, it cannot be arguedthttt it is Jammejayailaha bhavagupta I., v?ho has been wrongly shown on the list. This is at U-ust certain that tho Orissa record does not know anythingo Sivagupta who is the first kiugofthis lino. 
Since all the copper-plate grantsof MahSbhavagupta I. relutt; to villugeain Kusala-desa3 luding Sambalpar of course)it must be presumed that, to bi-in vnh, the Sniiwaihhi kirga me Powerful in Kflsala-defia only ;and that it was only subsequentlythat they extended their

Gh58ha (A and F 1), Walla Datta, son of Dhara Datta1 (F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4, and S)in the employment of Janamejaya;the names ChiLru Datta,2 Uchchhava Naga and Allava Naga3 under king Yayati (B) and the names SingaDatta4 and Mangala Datta under Bhimaratha (F 6). None but Bengali kayasthasbear Datta, GhOsha, Naga, etc., as surnames. The Uriya Karans (who may be called kayasfchas) never used such surnames. The words Datta, GhCsha, etc., as inseparable partsof the names of men, were in use in other partsof Northern India; and sach names coald be borne by personsof any and every caste. But aa these words are surnames here of Kayasthas,there can be no doubt that the kings had Bengali officers under them when they acquiredterritories in the forest tract of Samhalpur. 
The writers and engravers used the alphabet which was current amongstthem. Mr. Thomas remarked long agothat these letters resemble mostly, and are identical in some cases with, the modern Bengali alphabet, The letters Jfera, nga, fichu, tu, and pkaare striking exam pies. But it must also be borne in mind that some letters representthe modern Uriyaforms of them only. If we comparethe alphabetof the epigraphicrecords of the Pala and the Sena kings of Bengal, we can clearlysee how the modem forms of Bengali and Uriya letters were evolved. These characters were also in use in the district of Granjam, but they were slightly modified by southern influence (e.g. above, Vol. III., plate facing p. 222). Inscrip tions written purely by Uriya scribes also bear the forms of these letters with the provincial peculiarities of Bengali letters (C). I cannot deal with the historical significanceof it here. 
The cumulative effect of the forgoing facts is certainly on the side of the snggestionof Sir Alexander Cunningham that the Q-uptas who were Kosalendras and Trikalingadhipatis must have sprang from the Hinduised Sabara familyof Udayana. 
[The identification proposed by Mr. Mazumdar of Yimtapura with Binika in the Sonpur State has been arrived at independently by Bai Bahadur Hira Lai in his article on the Sirpur iStone Inscription of TVIahasiva Gupta which, though received priorto this . paper, has been unavoidably delayed for want of proper impressionsof the inscription, Ed.]

BY PROFESSOR STBN KONOW, Pn.D, ;CHRISTIANA. 
In the Indian Antiquary** has been published an "Account of a collection of copper-plates belonging to the Palitana State. By the late A. M, T. Jackson, I.O.S." Thetcollection consists of twelve plates, which were found some forty years ago. They were strung together on a copper wire, about f" thick, and suspended by it from the roof of a small underground chamber adjoining a tank in Palitana, Two of these plates form a grant by 
the Sdmanta 
Maharaja Simhaditya, the remainingten make np four complete and two incomplete Valabhi grants.6 The twelve plates have been kindlylent to Eai Bahadur V. Venkayya, the Govern ment Epigraphist for India, who has been good enoughto send me impressionsof eightof them, prepared at his request in Dr. Vogel'soffice. 
Bai Bahadur V, Venkayya describes the wire on which the plates had been strungas being about 8" in. length. Its two extremities are secured into an oval seal measuring 2Ty by If*,

It is comparable with the common modern spelling jyin order to denote tho puro palatal and not the sound dz in Marathi districts. This spellingis therefore of into.-OP i, for the chronology of the change of j- to dz in Marathi. Professor Jacobi1 has suggestedto call tho language usually designatedJaina Maharashtrl, the languageof Jaina commentators a,rui poels, Sanrashtri. He drawa attention to the old Jaina tradition that the ultimate reca.itli u o: tho Jaina books was made in Yalabhl in the year 980 after the Nirvana of Mahavirn. Tl. woiild tilaerefore seem probable that Jaina Maharashtrl represents the dialect of Valabhl ab?::t .300 A.D. 
J"aina Maharashtrl is closelyrelated to Maharashfcri, the parentof modern Marathi.- and nol; i;o Sauraseru, from which Gujarat!ia mainlyderived. There are also otherfailures wliioh point to the coEclueion that the languageof Eathyawarand Gujarat generally has noil always Ibeen- of the same kind as at the present day, but more like the dialects from -which Uai^ai.hl is derived,8 and it is therefore possibleto comparethe spelling jyin Yalabhl platesarid in tnodorn ^Marathi with each other, though Marathi is not now spokenin the districts where ihc^e plates were issued.

translates "which belongs to the Akshasarakaprapa," comparing the expression yraytya- in \. 5 of the copper-plate grantof GuhasSna of Samvat 248,1 instead of which we should perhaps read Tataptllikapr&piya-.It seems certain thatprSfiya, is synonymous with prSveJfy"* Tvhich also occurs in the Khariar plates' of Mahasudeva.9Pr&veSya may, of course, be a fiscal term. It is, however, not likely that it means anything else than what it does in the common phrase acfata-bhata-pravetya. PrSpiya must then be a Prakrit form of m&pya* I would accordingly translate Afahasaraka-pravesya"which is entered from Akahasaraka"<i e borders on Akshmraka. I cannot locate AkshasaraU The laatpart of the word is probably saralca, lake, pond. Of the remaining geographical names mentioned in the plates Valabhi and Hastavaprsharam have heen referred to ahove. The name Amrilika probably meas aboundingm mangoes."

Ill PALITANA PLATES OF DHRUVASENA L; [VALABHI-] SAMVAT 210. 
These are two plates which have been described as follows by Kui B;ili;uln.r V.Vunkayya, "Each of them has two riug-holes. Each plateis written only on one Hide. Tho workingof the engraver's tool shows itself in a few places on the back. Tho lengthof ihu platow is about 1QJ1'; the height varies from 6f"to 7}"." 
The plates are in a goodstate of preservation. The first contains ].,"> and ihu secoLd 12 lines of well executed -writing. The average heightof individual Joltoi-H Ls}'', 
The characters are of the same kind as in the plate's dealt with above. Th^y comprise the eigns for an initial au in Aupasvasti-,1. 17;for a fin:il t in tri/Mat, 1. 17 and w^mV'/, 1. 24; fou a final m in =anujnatam, 1. 19. The curious shapeof tho nsartjninkrittkttinlj,I. i!0; -yitalt, 1. 22; -adibhih, 1. 23; -vasihanah, 1.25,is probably due to tho rmfrravor's ruiRunderstaiidmg bis draft. Note also the eignsof -e- in-k;im=flka-, 1. 11, and of lo in J, 12, A sign of iutei punctuation occurs in 1. 25. The numerical symbols for 2UO, 10 and f> are found iri ]. 27. 
With regard to orthography the remarks made about tho preceding grants nlno hold good here. The wrong samdTii in blw?hjatd Ivrisli-,1. 20, may bo it Prakriti'Mii.

The grant is dated on the fifth, (titfci) of the dark (P) fortnight of Asvayuja, in the (Valabbi) year 210, correspondingto A,D. 529. The syllable denoting the fortnight has been miswritten, and it is possible that it should bo restored as h and not as 6a, The mistake is due to the anal syllableof the preceding word being wrongly

V. PALITANA PLATE OP [SILADITTA I. DHAEMADITYA ; VALABHI SAMVAT 286]. 
Eai Bahadur V. Venkayya has favoured me with the following description of thie plate, "One plate only of the inscriptionis preserved. (It has two ring-holes at the bottom, but neither the ring nor the seal which it migkt have borne is forthcoming. A small piece of the plateis broken, at the left top corner, damaginga portiono the symbol for &m. Likewise a small piece is missing at the beginning of 1. 10, where, however, no letter has been damaged. The plate is engraved only on one side. The working of the engraver'stool shows itself almost completely at the back. Length of plate varies from 11^"to llf". Height about 8JV* 
The plate contains 18 lines of well executed writing. The average height of individual letters is J*. 
The characters agree with those used in the grantsof SftadityaI. 
With regard to orthography, -we may note the use of n for ri in iridoAa-t1. 7 j of rt for fi in trina-, 1. 7;the writing of mgJi for mhia -samghatis*,1. 5 and in samghat-,1. 13;the use of n

The first in santana-, 1. 9, has been misshaped and looks almost like a v. Note also tl absence of samdU in -sabdali rupa~,1. 6, 
The plate contains onlythe formal portionof the grant and breaks off in the description< Slladitya I. Dharmaditya, but ifc is absolutelycertain that Mr. Jackson was rightinasBujninj that the grant was issued by him. The absence of samdhi in -fabdafy rfzpa-,1. 6;the -wor< -dhairyifa- in -sthairyya-dhairyya-gambMryya-,1. 6;and the word -l>ala- in 'dikJiila-'bala dhamrddharali, 1. 11, occur in all the grants of Slladitya bat not in other Valabhi grants,Ii is also possible to state definitely that the plate belongs to a. grant issued before Valabhi-Samval 290, because the spellings -samghatis-,1. 5; -tfidafaguru-,1. 7, and samghat-,1, 13, which alsc occur in the Wala plates of Valabhi-Samvat 286,are not found in the phank platesof Yalabhi SamYat 290. The last words of our plate are -ojvalatari-'krit'artt'ka-, and by comparingothei Valabhi grants we find that the second plate must have begun sukha'sampad-upasevS'. Now these are the first words of the fragmentarysecond Wala platsof SlladityaI. Dharmaditya , dated Sam. 200 80 6 Vaisakha-va(P) 6, which has been published by Dr. Bhandarkar.1 The length of that plate is} accordingto the editor, 12" and the height 8|-". The size therefore also agrees with that of our plate, and there cannot be any doubt that the two plates belong together, BO that the whole grant is now before ua. To judge from Dr, Bhandarkar's edition the second plate is not well preserved. I asked Bai Bahadur V. Venkayya to he good enough to try to get hold of it so that it could be republished together with the first plate. Hia endeavours to do so have not, however, been successful, and I therefore edit the beginningalone.

(Line 1.) Om. Hail! From ValabM. (In the lineage)of tbc Maitrakaa, who had by force prostrated (their) enemies, from the devout worshipper of Mahesvara, the illustrious Bhatarkka, who had acquired splendour in hundreds of battles conncc-ted with the circuit of the territories that he had obtained by means of his unequalled strength ; who had gained the devotion of those whom he had prostrated by his splendour through his gifts, honours and straightfor wardness;who obtained the gloryof royalty by the streng-Lh of the arrayof devoted hereditary servants (was descended], the royal lineage being uninterrupted, the devout worshipper of Mahesvara, the glorious Guhasena, whose sins were all washed away by the prostrations at the lotus feet of (his) mother and father ; to whom (his) sword was indeed a second arm from (his) childhood;and who brightened the touchstone of his strength by splitting openthe temples of the rutting elephants of his foes j the collection of the raysof the nails of whose feet was combined with the Instre of the crest jewels of hie foes who were prostrated by the power of that(strength) ; who rendered (his) title of king appropriate by pleasing the minds of (his), subjects by thoroughly observing the conduct laid down in. all the smrttis ; who in beauty, loveliness, stability, firmness, profundity, wisdom and wealth surpassed (respectively) Cupid, the moon, the king of mountains, the ocean, the preceptor of the gods (Brihaspati) and Dhanesa; who, through being intent upon granting safety to those who came for protection, threw away all the results of his deeds as if they were straw;who gladdened the hearts of learned people, friends and favourites by giving (them) riches in excess of their demands ; and who was, aa it were, the personified happiness of the vast circle of the whole world; 
(Line 9) his son (was) the devout worshipperof Mahesvara, the glorious Dharasena, whose sins were all washed away bythe flood of the waters of the Ganges which flowed from the cluster of rays of the nails of the feet of his (father^, whose wealth was being lived upon by hundreds of thousands of favourites;who was impetuously resorted to by attractive qualities as

No, 10.-BURMESE INSCRIPTION AT BODH-GAYA, 
BY TAW SEIK Eo. 
Translations of this inscription have already been publishedat pages208-210 of Rajendra lala Mitra's Buddha G-aya,f and at page 76 of Cunningham's Mahabodlvi. There is some contro' versy aa to the correct reading of the dates. The initial date is undoubtedly 657, which corresponds to 1295 A.D., and the final date 660, which is equivalentto 1298 A,D. During the period indicated by these two dates, the Burmese empire of Pagan was in the throes of a Chinese invasion, In 1284, Pagan had been occupied bythe Chinese, In 1298 A.D., Kyawzwar the titular king, had been dethroned by three Shan brothers, who bore divided rule at the new capitals of Myinzaing, Metkaya, and Pinle" in the Kyaukse district. Two years later, the Chinese again invaded Myinzaing,. In these circumstances, the onlyinference is that the last repairs to the Mahsbodhi Temple alluded to in the inscription were carried oat under the auspices o! a king of Arakan. 
There is, however, some difficulty in the identification of the personages mentioned in the inscription. Mahtithera Pinthagugyi oannofc be identified with certainty. Pmthagugyior the "great Pinthagn"is a title, designation, or sobriquet, rather than a personal name, and is derived from, the Pali word jpamsukfiUka,*c one -vtho obtains the materials for his clothing from a dust heap or a cemetery." Such a title was nsuallyconferred on a Buddhist monk of exceptional sanctity and austerity, who had secured the esteem and admiration of the laity. There was such a celebrated Buddhist monk at Pagan during the reign of Narapatisithu (1167-1204 A.D.). 
Thadomin sounds like an Arakanes'e title of a king or prince.It does not occur in the chronological lists appendedto Phayre's History of Surma. 
King Sinbyuthakin is called in the inscription BinbyiriMkhin TrS, Mingyi The first part means M the Lord of the White Elephant," and the second"Dhammaraja." Here, again, the expression is a common regaltitle and not a personal name. 
SmdhammarSjagura is the title of a learned monk. All royal preceptors are called "Dhammarajagum," or the"King's 0wrtt."

A great deal of interest centres round the designation "Pyu-ta-thein-niin", which appears as"Pu-ta. thin min"in lines 9-10 of the inscription below. I am inclined to identify this personage with the King Sinbyuthikhra" mentioned in the same inscription, and both with Meng-di, No. 9 of the"Dynasty of the City Loung-Kyet"at page 801 of Phayre'a History of Surma, This king reigned from 1279 to 1385, and is described as a"son of Meng bhi-ln ". There are two"Meng-bhMns," namely, No. 7 of the same dynasty, who reigned from 1272 to 1276 A,D., and No. 12 of the !' dynastyof Ping-tsa City," who ruled from 1075 to 1078 A.D. (page 299, ibid').

was restored to his ancestral throne by AlaungsitTm, Kyanzitfcha's grandson and successor, in 1103 A.D., with the aid of 100,000 Pyus and 100,000 Talaings. Hence the fortunate prince ia known in history as"Pyu-ta-thein-min,"or"Lord of the 100,000 Pyus"(vide page 40, ibid), It is most probable that Meng-di, during whose reignthe inscription'was set np afc Bodh-Gaya, was a descendant of Letyamengnanand was also called a"Pyu-ta-thein-min." 
On the same page, Phayre says: ' Alaungsithu caused the Buddhist temple at Gaya to be repaired." I am inclined to think that, on that occasion, the King of Pagan deputed the Mahathtira Pinthagugyi to superintendthe work, and that he requiredhis protegf, Letyameng nan, to render the necessaryassistance in this work of merit. It would then appear that the "Thadomin"mentioned in the inscription waR a descendant of Letyamengnan, the Prince, who first bore the title of"Pju-ta-thein-min"or"Lord of the 100;000 Pyus." 
It is quite possible that one of the conditions of Letyamengnan's restoration to the Ara kanese throne was that, for the accumulation of merit of Alaungsithu, his suzerain and bene factor, he and his descendants were to render material assistance in the repair aud maintenance of the temple at Bodh-Gaya. Viewed in this light, the chronologyof the inscription and the raison d'etre of the proceedings recorded therein become clear, reasonable, and logical,

TEANSLATIOIST, 
1 When 218 years of the era of the Beligion of the Lord Buddha had passed away, Siridhammasoka, the "Ruler of Jambudipa, 
2 built 84,000 ohaityas, one of which was situated on the site, 
3 where the Buddha took a meal (ofrice porridgeoffered by Sujatabefore attaining Enlightenment). This shrine, owing to the effluxion of time, fell into rain, 4 and was repaired bythe Miahafchera Pinthagugyi. Subsequently, 
5 it was repaired by Thadomin. It againfell into disrepair,
120 EP1GRAPHIA INDICA. [Vol.   
6 and Bang SmbyutMkhin deputed the Royal Preceptor, 
7 Siridhammarajaguru, to undertake the work of repair. 
8 Sirikassapa, the disciple of the Preceptor, had sufficient funds, 
9 but could not take the work in hand (owing, probably,to the absence of 
artisans) 
10 He, therefore, sent Varavasi, a junior Thera, 
11 to King Eyutathin Min, who complied with the solicitation for assistance. 12 The work of repair was begun on Friday, the 10th, waxing of Pyatho 657 33-13 (January 1295 A.D.), 
13 and was completed on Sunday, the 8th, waxing of Tazatmgmon 660 B.E. 1298 A.D.) 
14 The following offerings were dedicated to the shrine : flags and streamers, 1,000 of rice and 1,000 lamps (for several times), 2 boys in the placeof the donor's own children, 15 and gold and silver flowers and cloth hung on bamboo framework. 
16 In order to provide for the daily offering of rice at the shrine, at all times, 17 laud, slaves, and cattle were purchased and likewise dedicated. May this 18 meritorious deed of mine lead me on to Nirvana ! 
19 May I become a disciple of Metteyya, the coming Buddha ! 
No. 11. DATES OF OHO LA KINGS. 
BY PROFESSOR H. JACOBI, BONN. 
I have received from the Government Epigraphlst, Mr. Venkayya, a large numlicr of dates for examination, of which I here publish 32 datesoj! Chola kings. In acceptingthis task I may be permitted to give expressionto my admiration of the work done by my predecessor, tli late Professor Kielhorn. "Without the results he had worked out with inexhaustible patience, I probably should not have succeeded in verifying many of the dates which are now published. 
The date? have been calculated with the helpof my General Tables publishedin Volume X, p, 443 of this journal. The time of the end of titUs and naTtshatras is givenin ghaiikss only, when the result at issue would nofc be influenced by a few ghatikas, more or less. In thoae cases, however, where a higher degreeof accuracyis wanted, I have made use of the newspecial tables which I am going to publishin Part iv. of this volume. These tables yield the result within a few palas accordingto the Arya, Surya, and Brahma-Siddhantas, and the Siddhanta-SirflmanL 
The date No. 198 reduces the time previously found for the commencement of the reign of Rajadhiraja II. to the jteriod from the 7th to the 30th March 1163 A.D. The remaining dates confirm the results previously found.

"In the 4th year (ofthe. raiyn) of the emperor of the three worldB, the glorious Rajarajadeva, on the dayof Kevati, which eorrespondedto a Tuesday and to the tenth tithi of the first fortnight of the mouth of Dhanus." 
This date is also a doubtful one. The tithi givenin the inscription correspondsto the 18th December 1219 A.D., but ifc is a Wednesday 'ami is coupled with the nahshatra Bhaiaiil and Krittika. The preceding day was a Tuesday,but it was the 9th tithi and was coupled with Asvini and Bharam. If we assume tho month to have been Vriscbika instead of Dhanujs (for there are instances of Biich mistakes in these inscriptions, see above, vol. IX, p. 220, note 12, andp. 221, note 4), we find that Tnesday, the 19th November 1219 A.D., was the llth tithi of the bright fortnightof Vrischika, not the tenth tithi as stated in the inscription ; tut this tenth (lunar) tithi was coupled with the naltshatra, Bevafcl, the one ending 13 ghatikat before mean sunrise, the other beginning 40 ghafikaebefore it;cf.

Tlie date corresponds almost certainlyto Monday, the 20th February 1223 A.D. Bat the original date contains two errors : (1)it was not the' first' fortnight, because in it the naMntra Svntl is impossible ; (2)it was not the 3rd but the 4th til hi. For, oncalculatingthe above d;.te we find that the SOfch February correspondedto the 4th tithi of the dark fortnight of Kumbha '^~ *\ and that almost the whole day coincided with the nakshatra Svati.

I take this date to correspond to^unday,the 3rd May 1318 A,D. This day was actually the 8th solar Rishabha (Jyaishtha), not the 4th as found in the transcript of the inscription; the 2nd titU of the first fortnightof Jyaishtha (Rishabha) ended about 13 gMihs after mean sunrise at Lanka,bat the nakahntra ftohini had ended about 26 gJiatikas before sunrise, If would therefore appearthat the mbliatra, quoted was that current at the beginningof the tithit thoughit had ended before the day which is called after that titti.

This date apparently correspondsto Wednesday, 16th December 1422 A.D., the oorres* ponding Jovian year of southern reckoning being Subhakrit. But the third tithi has wrongly been quoted for the second. For, on the calculated day which was the 19th solar Dhanus, the 2nd titjii of the first fortnight of Pausha (Dhaaus) was current at sunrise at Lanka and BO was the nrikshatra Sravana. The third titlvi began about 5 ghatik&s after raean sunrise at Lanka, and the nahshatra {Sravana ended about 52 ghatikdsafter sunrise. It would therefore appear that the current t&M has been quotedinstead of the one which ended on that day.

No. 15.- TIRUVELLARAI INSCRIPTION OF DANTIVARMAN. BY K. V. SUBRAHMANTA AlYAR, B.A., OoTACAMUND." 
The subjoined inscription1 is engravedon some of the stones formingthe margin of the wdl on the southern side of the Pundarikaksha-Perumal temple at Timvellarai, This Tillage is at a distance of 12 miles to the north of Trichinopoly and has several interesting ancient monuments. Among them may be mentioned (1) the rock-cut Siva templeof Jambu uatlia8 called in its inscriptions the Tiruvanaikkal-Perumanadiga],, with an inscribed boulder in front;8(2) the Vishnu temple of Pundarikaksha-Perurnal with another rock*cut cave4 on the southern side of its first prak&ra; and (3) the -well on which the subjoined inscriptionis engraved.5 Besides the above, there are the ruins of another Siva temple in that partof the village where the Pallava well is situated. A big linga and a largesized Nandi are still to be Been in a field not far from the well. 
The stones bearing the record under notice are nofc^in proper order, but as none of them ia missing, it has been possibleto piece them together and make out the inscription completely. It is in an excellent state of preservation, having been engraved after the stones had been dressed for the purpose. The engraver seems to have taken greatcare as. the record is almost free from any mistakes. The letters are cut deeply and the inscriptionis written in two sections of two lines each. The languageof the record is Tamil prose and verse with an admixture of Sanskrit words and phrases written in Grantha characters. 
The following peculiaritiesof the alphabetdeserve notice. The vertical line to the rightof ra in sva reaches the full height of the topletter sa. Tbe secondaryi is written from the right to the left and touches the consonant on the rightside only. The secondary a is denoted by a short vertical stroke added to tlae rightof the letter so as to touch it bya small horizontal line at the top. The length of the vowel a and the a of the combined consonant vu are as dis tinctly marked as in the modern characters. Fa presents an early type. The bottom portion of Au is drawn out into a flourish as sometimes to completely cover the letter that precedesit, All the ya's occurringin this inscription have a big loopat the beginning. The symbol

* The inscriptions on the outer walls of this temple which may be considered not so old as the cave itself, belong to the time of Rajakesarivarman, Pamntata, I. and Kajendra-Chola I. (Nos. 612 to 514 of 1905). The cave cousisti of a cell cut into the rock with two uiches on either 'rale. Of the two to the right, the first contains an image of "Vishnu, while the second enshrines the godGanela. In the two niches on the left side are putin stone images of a later date. The front partof the cave mayhe described as a verandah with four pillars cut out of the same rock. 
s Aa raany as 16 inscriptions have been copied from thia boulder (Nos. 515 to 530 of 1905). They rangein date from the time of a Pallava kingivhose inscriptionis partiallybuilt in bya modern platformraised in front of thu slirbe of the goddess, to those of the early Ohola sovereigns Rajskesarivarman, Parakosarivarraan, Parjintaka I. aud Vikram-Ch6la., The texts of IB of these records hare been printed by the late Pandit Natesa Sastri (Ind. Anl Vol. XXXIV, pp. 265 ff.). 
1 Ten inscriptions of the Bpigraphical collection for 1905 (Nos. 531 to 540)are from this cave* the Icings represented being Nandivaraan, BJtjfiijesi'rivaTman, Parakesanvannac, Kajarfija I,, and Parakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya.' One of the inscriptions (Kb. 534 of 1905)dated in the 8th yearof a Parakesari varuiau SB Interesting as ifc refers to gifts made by the queenof Udaiyar.Aji&imer,r,ufijin5r (i.e. the king who" died on uu elephant's hack) to the god^rl-Iuislina and his consort Rnkmini of the big templeat Tirnvellajai, At present there is no shrine in the Pundarikakeha-Perumal temple dedicated to Sri-Ktishna but there is an image of thfit trod found on the outer ffopurtt, rightof entrance. We cannot be certain if thia is the image referred to. 1Efofl, 541 and 542 of the Madras Epigraphicalcollection for 1905 are engraved on stones forming the 
margiij of this well.

touches the consonant that follows it. One graphic peculiarityof the record is that the loops of sand are fully developed and the consonant rai resembles to agreat extent tho letter na. The pulli (or mrSm) is invariably marked byaslightly curved line cut on fche top of the letters. It is wrongly marked on $ein ^ruigiwu (1, 2, section1) and on m in 
wimmiBSg (end of 1. 2, section 2). The Sanskrit words and letters that occur in theinscription 
are ; narti and m at the beginningof the record, Bkamdvaja-gStra, Dmtwamma arid Paltom tilataltulotihava. in linfi 1; ratshi of ratiMppSrin line 2 and fri at the commencement of the Tamil verse in section 2, line 1. 
The object of the inscriptionis to record the construction of the well called Marppidugu perringinaru by one Kamban-Araiyaij, theyoungerbrother of a certain Visaiyanallulan of Alambakkam, The work was commenced in the 4th year of Dantivarman, who belonged to the Pallavatilata (tilaka) family which is said to have sprung from the Bharadvaja-^ra, and completed in his 5th year. The capacityof the well accounts for the time taken in its construction. There are four entrancesleadinginto the well and theyare so constructed as to 
give it the shape of the wastiha symbol yi\ The Tamil verse in section 2 is written in the 
Asiriyaviruttam metre, each line containing six feet (&>).It declares that no objectin this world is permanent, that life is sure to decay, and that, therefore, if one commands wealth, he must, after taking what , is requiredfor his maintenance, utilise the remainder in doing works of charity, 
An inscription dated in the 8th year (=A.D. 1262-3)of the Hoysaja king Vira Bamanathadeva found on the marginof the same well records that a merchant (wwi'i/a) repaired it as it had suffered considerable damagefrom floods and other causes.3 The same record refers to the well as lavingbeen built bya merchant. In the 13th century AD. the builder of the well was believed to have been a private individual and not a chief, as the title A-miyan appended to his name would lead one to believe,3It is also interestingto learn that repairs were executed to it in A.D. 1262. It was perhapsthen that the inscribed stones got out of order. 
The proper names that occur in this record are of specialinterest. Alambakkam may be identified with the village of the same name situated at a distance of 12 miles from Lalgudi on the road to Ariyalur. Dantivarmamangalam and Madhurantaka-chaturvedimanga lam were. its other names in ancient times, and it was situated in Poygai-nadu which was a sub division of Kajendraaingavalanadu.4 Tiruvellarai is said to have been a village in Vadavali nadu, a district of Rajasraya-valana<Ju5. The members of the village assemblyof Tim vellajai are referred to in two records of the Chflla king RajarajaI, found in the BajarajeSvara 
1 From each of the entrances, a flight of steps leads to the interior of the well, Midway between the entrance and tile bottom of the well, on what may be described as the portal,is a pieceof sculpture which was, in allpro bability, carved at the time when the well was constructed and hence synchronous with it. There are thus four groups of sculptures in all, on the four sides. The principal figures on the northern side are Biva and Parvati seated on a pedestal with attendant deities, flanked on either aide bya nan&i A number of female figures, probablythe saptamatfis, are found ou the southern side. With an attendant deity on the right side, the god Yoga-Narasimha is figured on the eastern side in a sitting posture with legs folded and crossed and with somethinglike a cloth passing round them. This group is flanked on the left bya lion while to the rightis a t/ali. I am not able to identify the images on. the western side. Here are the figures of 'a warrior armed with a sword, a horse and t few other images. s No. 542 of the Epigraphical collection for 1905 and An*wl Report on Epigraphyfor 1905-06, p, 69, para'

temple at Tanjore and were requiredto supply two toahmach&rws as temple-servants and tw other persons as watchmen to that temple.1 
The well Ifarppidugn-perunginajTishould hare been named either after the reigning kin; or a local chief uucltjr him. That it was not called after the builder is evident from the fact tha lie bore a different name. Nor do we know that Dantivarman had the surname Marppiduga Jt may be pointed -mt lie re that there was in ancient times a familyof kings called Muttaraiyar ruling over a portion of the Tanjore and Trichinopolydistricts and a part at least of the Pudut kcttai State.2 Some or the members of this family had for their surnames Perumbidugu, Videl vidugn, 060. Senclalai, one of the places where their inscriptions have been found, is not far off from Alambaiiain whence the builder of the Tiruvellarai well hails. It may further be^noticed that at AJambafcfcam, tlwre was, accordingto its inscriptions a big tank called Marppidug-eri. It is just possible that both the Marppidug-eriof Alambakkam aod the Marppidugu-perunginaju of Tiruvellarai came into existence at the same time and were named after the same person who, to judge from the similarityof the name, might have been a member of the Muttaraiyan family and a feudatory of the Pallava king Dantivarman of our record. 
From its Tamil work N'llayiraprabandliam,it appearsthat the Vishnu templeat Tiru vellarai was in existence from an early period,3 as the Vaishnava saints Periyalvar and Tim man.gai-A<ivar composed hymns in its praise. The latter saint mentions the village not less than four times in his compositions and there is not much doubt that one of these references, viz. Veil-armyid ItaUarawiel* has to be taken to denote the rock-cut cave in the Pandarikaksha Pevumal temple. From the fact that Tirnmangai-Alvar mentions in his hymn on ParamSfiyara vinnagar soiue of thy battles where the Pallava king Nandivarman Pallavamalla gained victories over the Piindya sovereign and refers to another Pallava king Vayiramegan,it has been surmised tluit the Alvur was a contemporaryof the latter and lived in the period imme diately following1 the reignof the former whose achievements wore fresh in the saint's miud.s Tirumangai-Alvar lias thus been alignedto the 3rd quarterof the 8th century A.D. Accord ingly, the cave in tlie Ptiml'inkaksha-Perumal temple probably came into existence before that time. One of the earlient inscriptions in the cave belongsto the time of a Pallava tilaka king Nandivarman. This record mentions a certain Visaiyariallulan., who is perhapsthe same as that ViSaiyanallfiJan whoso youngerbrother was Kamban-Araiyan,the builder of the well afc Tirnvellarai. If this be the case,it may be concluded that Nandivarman was perhapstha pre decessor of Dantivarman. At anyrate he could not ba far removed in pointof time from the 
other.

sInscriptions of this family have been, found at Senclalai and Tiruchchattur.ai in the TanjoreDistrict; where there was n village called Yidelvidugu-clmturvedimangalam. Tirumaiyam and Malaikkoyilin the Pudakkottai State also contain their records. T)je cave at Uarttamalai was excavated by the son of Videlvidugu-Matkraiyag. A weight called YideMdvflu-leal was in use afc UyyHlckondan-Tirumalainear Trichinopoly, 
a From some of these stanzas, it apiu-avs that the god in tlie Vishnu temple was in a standing posturein 
ancient times also.

No, 15.] TIRUVELLAMI INSCRIPTION OF DANTIVARMAF. 157   
King Dantivarman of the subjoinedrecord is stated to have been born in tlio Pallavatilaka family which, had sprung from the Bharadvaja-^tra.Inediting the Triplicane inscription of Dantivarma-Maharija, Mr. Yenkayyaremarked that he was perhapsthe immediate successor of Naudivarman Pallavamalla and added in a note that his successors piohably s>pokc of themselves 
as belonging to the "family of the Pallavatilaka," And Falkvalilaka is a shortened form of Pdlamhdatilah which was actually borne as a title by Dautivaraa-Mahiiiiijaof the Triplicane inscription.1 Nandivarman Pallavamalla was a usurperas we know from the Kasa bidi plates. Subsequent kings (there are at least two known BO far) claimingdescent in the Pallava line, trace their ancestry apparentlyto Dantivarman of the Triplicane inscription as evidenced by the epithet Pallavatilaku.-'kitlfid'bhava prefixedto their names. The application of this epithet to the king of the presentrecord necessitates oar distinguishing him from Danti "the ornament of the Pallava race," That snch a distinction has to be made 
vanna-Maharaia. 
i/ f 
is also evident from the fact that this is not the only inscription which introduces this family. Not less than five records have, so far, been found where members belongingto the Pallavatilaka family are mentioned,3 and it is therefore difficult tosupposethat all the writers did not intend anydifference between the terms Pallavahila, and PallavatihlMkula. 
Jrom the Tiruviilaugadu grant of ftajendr.vOhoja L, we know that Aditya I, father of Parantaka I. (A.D, 907947) foaght with the G-anga-Pallava Aparajita.;! This king may be supposed to be the son of Nripatungavikramavarmauand his suoarsRor. in two records of the 18th and 22nd yearsof Nripatunga, Adigal-Kamban-Maram'bavai, queenof Nandivarman of the Pallaratilaka family makes grants and there is a much damaged inscription in the AiravateSvara temple at Niyamam apparentlydated, duringthoreignof a Chola kingalso registering a grant made by the same queeit.4 from those facts it maybe concluded that, of the two kings of the Pallavatilaka familyhitherto known, Nandivurraan was either a con temporary of the Ganga-Pallava Nripatuigaviferamavarmiinor lived priorto his time bya few years.As Danfcivarman of the subjoined inscription haa bet-n shown to be closer in pointof time to this Nandivarman, he may be assigned roughlyto the beginningof the 9th century A.D,

First Section. 
Hail ! Prosperity ! In the fourth year (of the reign)of Dantivarman who was born in t Pallavatilaka family which had sprung from the Bharadvaja-^oira, Kamlban Araiyan, younger brother of Visaiyanallulan of AlamTbakkam, commenced (to build) the big \v at Termur1 in Tiruvellarai and completed (it) in the fifth (year oft~ke same rei<\<* Marppidugu-perunginaru is the name of this (well). The three-thousand and sev* hundred3 of thia village shall protectthis (charity). 
Second Section. 
Prosperity ! Without being (passionately) attached to this world where men seen (foi? are not seen (tomorrow); without giving (yourself) up to despair lookingfor the (final) 3 appointed by the Creator ; and before your (limbs) become weak at the appearanceof old with its (appendage of a) stick; if you have (wealth) maintain (yourself) and devote (xh remains to charity) so that (all) the world may know (it). 
No. 16, NEW SPECIAL TABLES FOB THE COMPUTATION OP HINDU DATES. Bi EHRMANN JACOBI, PH.D.,# 
Sanskrit Professorat Bonn, Germany. 
The new Special Tables which I publish now are intended to supplementthe General Tables in the same way as the old Special Tables dp, which were publishedin Vol. I. above, p. 450 L i.e, they are intended to test, accordingto one of the principal siddhantas named at tbye head of the several Tables, the approximateresult calculated previously bythe General Tables To these new Tables the remark in 4, p. 403 I. c. appliesalso. u The General Table is to be used first;and only when by that table the end of the tiflvi falls very near the beginning of the day, and the week day comes out in error by one day only, teed the Special Tables for th** several siddhantas be tried to see if one of them will furnish the desired result." 
The plan on which the new Tables have been constructed is the same as in the QenerttJ Tables* as far as their object, the highest possible degreeof accuracy?will allow- Therefore the new Tables (1) refer throughout to mean sunrise at Lanka, notj as the old Special Tables do, to the ^ginning of the Solar year ; (2) theyfurnish the quantities on which the tifhi depends, in decimals of the cirole and not in degrees, minutes and seconds as is the case in the old Table*. These innovations render the workingof the new Tables very easy and almost mechanical. 
The Special Tables differ from the General Tables in two points ; (1) Theycontain three columna headed a, 6, c instead of the two in the General Tables headed 'TitW and' ([ 's anomaly. a denotes mean distance of Sun and Moon, expressedin five decimals of the cirole. By Table* XVIII, XIV, XV a can be converted into tithis, ghatih&s, andpaZas;6 denotes the1mean anomaly of the moon hi four decimals of the circle ; and c the mean anomalyof the Sun, also i# 
1 The southern ^parb of TiruveJiajpi was probably called Tennur in ancient times, 
2 The signatory in one of the inscriptions of BajurajaI (A.D. 985-1013) found at Mamallapnrainin tb* Chingleput District la a certain Tinm4ig4 MaaikanthaT},a native of Timve|[*]aj;ai. He calls himself as one 0* the a,700 cf that village (Sotfi^Inc^. Inscrs. Vol. I., p. 65), Th)a seems to indicate that at an. early periodfcher* was a body of 3,700 persona at Tirave^apaito whom later members traced their descent, Beference to another suck body of men is found in the expression

four decimals. (2) To the sum of a (mean distance of Sun and Mooa) iw corrections (equations) must be applied, while in the General Tables only one equation is needed. The argumentsof these equations are the suma of & and c, respectively, and theyare to be looked out in the tables of equations under the several siddfi&ntas. In order to calculate the value of the equationfor an argument riot entered in the table, but lying between two ta-ble values, a column headed A 10 
has been inserted in the middle of these tables, which givesthe increase or decrease of the equation for a difference of ten in the argument. 
I now proceed to illustrate the working of the new Tables by a few examples. First example. Let it be proposedto verify the date : Kali-Yaga 4198, Chaitra j?i*. di. 2 raucra, according to the Surya-Siddhauta. We first calculate the date accordingto the General Tables, and write down the calculation in the proper form (see above, Vol. 1, p. 410). 
4100 KT. (1) 5'58 111 Ind. * =2043 
98 years (4) 399 59 Ind. su. di. 2 =22-43 
4198 K.T. (5) 9'57 170 
15th sol. Chaitra (4) 22'52 593 
(2) 2-09 763 
eq, 763=0 
2-09 
Result: On the Monday (2)in question, the third titU was running;it commerced nn the preceding day (Sunday), about 5| yhatikasbefore mean, sunrise. Now in order to cnleulatii tbo result according to the Surya-Siddhanta, proceed as follows. Look out FC T. 41UO or -il.it century K. Y. in table I, 98 years in table II, and 15th Chaitra in table XIII (which is the sumo for all Siddhantas) and sum upthe quantities in the several columns (rejecting integers) ;thus 
K, Y. 4198, 15 Chaitra (2) 0915 2660 7353 Now find the equation for & 2660 from table III,via, 5, and the equationfor c.=iW> table IV, 1*. 3;' then add these equationsto a, ato. 6915 + 5 + 3=69*8. Tablo XVT1J gives 6667=*. di. 2j the difference from a just found, 6923-6667 = 256;this i accordingto mMes XIV and XV equal to 4 ghatifos (a=226) and 32 pnlos (a=30).Therefore, accordingt" tl c> Snrya-Siddhanta, the 2nd titU ended 4 gKatiJeSs 34 palasbefore m0au sunriBC. Tins i-esu^ very nearly right, and we may in most cases rest satisfied with it. If the lugni-Rt(_|y"*t accuracy be required we subtract the increase of a & c for 4 ghatikfis 2 palas from tabled *. XV to the result found before ;cw. from C915 22

Madhupapali ;to the north-east Talanjarasila. I cannot localise any of these names with the exception of the river Vamsadhara, which flows through the Ganjam and Vizagapatam districts. On it is a village which in the Indian Atlas is called Varanasy, situated in 18 51" N. and 83 56" 
E., and which I would identify with the Varanasi-kataka mentioned in the Purl plates of Nara simhadeva IV.1 Another locality mentioned in Ganga plates, the Varahavartani.2 1 would look for in the course (variant)of the Varahanadi, which rises in the Golkonda hills to the north of Narasapatam and flows into the Bay of Bengal at Vatada. 
The date of our grant is the Saka year 987, on the ninth day of the (solar) month Mma, on a Monday. It is consequentlythe oldest known grant of Vajrahasta III, The writers of the grant, the sandhwigral^i Dhavala, who is described as the granb writer (ti&sanika kayastha) of Tampava, and the Icftraki Mentoju, are not elsewhere known,

No. 14.. 'NARASAPATAM PLATES OF VAJRAHASTA IIL; 
SAKA-SAMYAT 967. 
BY PROFESSOR STEN KONOW, PH.D.; OHBISTIIHU. 
The grant inscribed on these plates was first brought to light by Mr. Appa Rao, and a short cote on it appeared on page111 of Mr. Krishna Sastri's Annual Report on Epigraphy for the year 1908-1909. I now edit it from ink-impressions supplied byEai Bahadur V". Venkayya, who has kindly sent me the followiag descriptionof the plates: 
"These are five copper-plates with slightlyraised rims, of which 'the first bears writing only on the inner side. Theymeasure roughly 7f" in length and fluctuate between SJ* and 3^ in breadth. The plates are held together by a circular ring, which measures 4f"in diameter and is nearly |* thick, The edgesof the ringare secured in the bottom of an oval seal, which measures roughly 2|" and 2|"in its diameters. The seal is surmounted by a high recumbent ball with various emblems around it, which Mr. Appa Eao says represent a conch, an elephant goad, a trtiula, a battle-axe, a crescent, a mace, a rope, and a drum. The plates with seal and ring weigh 295 tolas. The plates were received from the Narasapatam taluka of the Yizaga patam district". 
The inscription consists of 74 lines and is in a fair state of preservation. 
The alphabet is the same kind of KSgari as in Vajrahasta's Nadagam plates of Saka-Sam vat 979,1 and in his Madras Museum platesof Saka 984.3 The ft in conjuncts such as tith and ftj is placed after the consonant. The compound fij, which occurs in 1, 69, is not used, in any of the other known plateaof Yajrahasta.It will be seen that the form of the y of this compound is slightly changed. There is almost no difference between $3 (1. 55) and da, (!. 51) ; between tu (cf. 1. 25) and tta (cf.1. 26);between lu (of.1. 23) and ww (of. 1.22). The owtttJflra is usually denoted by a circle after the consonant. At the end of line 3 and before the sign of intei-puncfcion in 1. 52, a virama is added underneath. The signof the vvrama is also found in -nwahOn, 1. 17 ; amabfatna%, 1. 27. It has been omitted in vaodfina, 1. SI ; -pwras aar&na- . . . janapafana,1. 51 ; y&vata,1. 56 ; -adity&ta,1. 58 ; -gaw&vzta, 1. 64 f. In ad<Zwa, 1. 21, and -janapadZna, L 5], the bottom of the letter has been somewhat lengthened. There are several superfluous signsof interpunotionin the grant itself,11. 53 ff. The numerical figures 967 occur .in 1. 73. 
In 11, 7 and 50 some syllables and words are written in Teluguletters. 
With regard to orthography we may note forms like -prakshyalita instead of -pratoUlita-, 1. 4; na-mtye instead of navrritye,1. 67, and the use of t> instead of 6; compare -tavda-,

No. 4.1 THE CHAHAMANAS OF MAEWAB. 71   
in the mountainous part of Surashtra. The latter event is alluded to in the Nad5l copper-plate inscription of Kirtipala noted above. The Prabandhaohintamani speaksof Kumarapala aa having sent his general Udayana agaiasb Sausara, kingof Surgshfcra, Tvith -whom be was -at war. In this fight Kumarapala's armywas defeated, and Udayana was mortally Bounded, In the end, however, Samara (Sausara),as the Kumarapalacharita says, was defeated and his son placed on the throne. It was probably Alhana who provedinstrumental in securingthis victory for Kumarapala. Alhana seems to have suffered for his allegianceto the Chaulukya dynasty at the hands of Vigraharaja, son of Arnoraja of the imperial Chahamana family. For the latter, as the BijOlia inscription1 informs us, made Naddula (Nadol)a nadvala, i.e. a bed of reeds and Jabalipura (Jalor) jvalapura,i.e. a cityof flames. Alhana is there said to have married Annalladevi, daughterof Sahula of the Rashtrauda3 family. Alhana had three sons by her, vis. Kelhana, Gajasimha and Kirtipala. Alhana appearsto have given a share in the administration of hia kingdomto his first two sons. For,in No. XII, the sign-manual of Alnanadsva is followed up bythe approvalof both his sons, Kelhanadeva and Gajasimha. Even the villages round about Nadlai, made over to Kirtipalafor his maintenance in the Nadol plate, were granted to him not byhis father Alhana alone, but also by Kelhana, his brother. It is curious that Gajasimhais not mentioned in this connection. He must doubtless have been alive at this time;otherwise his name would not have been specified in this inscription in 1. H.s Probably Kelhana's name alone is here mentioned because he was the yuvarajaor heir-apparent, as is quite clear from 1. 16 of the record. 
Of Kelhana no less than six inscriptions were found by me with dates ranging from V.E. 1221 to 1236. All atiadeva thus died in some year between V.E. 1218 and 1221. Kelhana appears to have remained tributaryto Kumarapala,for No. XIV refers itself to the reign of Kumarapala,and speaksof Kelhana as raler of Nadulya (Nadol). This record is dated in Samvafc 1228, which is, in fact, the latest authentic date we have for the Chaulukya sovereign, who, accordingto Gujarat chronicles, died a yearlater. The Sundha hill inscription represents Kelhana to have routed a Turusnka king and erected a golden tSrana,"like a diadem for the abode of the holy S5mea," His brother Kirtipalaalso is spoken of in the same inscription as having vanquisheda Turushka army at Kssahrada. Both these descriptions must refer to one and the same event, for about this time only one

Munshi Devi Prasad, in bia Hindi work entitled"AntiquarianDiscoveries jn Balputana"tells us Wat Dhanopa,16 miles north of Shahpura, two inscription stones had been found as early as A D 1373 which gave an account of a Rashtrakuta family rulingtbere. Four names had therein been traced, fe. 
Those of BhaUila, bis son Dantivarma, and his sons Buddharaja and GSvinda. One of the inscriptions was dated Sa^o,tm3VoSa3a^di5S^- (Ind.Ant.^\.^L. p. 176). Another ascription was found at Jlathund! near Bimpur in the Ball District which describes a new B.aShtrakuta family. This has been referred to above. A part of this inscription was published by Professor Kielhorn in the Jour. Benff.As.Soc.Vol. LXVII, 
Dart 1 PP. 309-3,14, and the completetext has recently been edited by Pand.it Ram Kama of Jodhpur (above, Vol. X. pp 17 B ). This contains three dates, the last of vrhich is V.E. 1053 (A.D. 99V;, .and pertainsto the ..eign^of the E^shtrakuta Dhavala of Hastikundi (Hathundi).It is reasonable to fluppose that the Bashtrakuta family,*) whlQh Annalladevi belonged, was .the one 'reigning at mthundi in Qodvad, and not the other one reign^gto north as Shahpura We have already soen that it was a kingof this Hatbundi Kaahtralcuta family, w.

and Y.E, 1132 (A.D. 1075) is the earliest hitherto known date for a Mfirwar Chahamana king derived from a contemporaryrecord. 
His son and successor was Prithvipala, who defeated an arrayof the Gurjara king Kama, i.e. the Chaulukya king Zarna-Trailokyamalla, son of Ehlmadeva I, a contemporary of AhUa, Anahilla and Balaprasada. Like many of his predecessors, he too seems to have erected a temple to Siva at Nadol and called the deity Prithvipalesvara after himself- Ho was succeeded by his brother Tojaka, also known as Jojala, or Jojalla. He is mentioned as having by force occupied Anahillapura (Anbilvada). NOB. I and II give for him the date Y.B. 1147, i.e. A.D. 1090, which contain his mandate for the observance of festivals in connection with the gods Laksh manasvarnm and others at Nadfll. Jcjala seems to have dedicated a temple to Siva at Nadol, and named the latter Jojalesvara after himself. After him came to the throne his brother AsarSja, also called Asvaraja and Asvaka. Three inscriptionsof his time (Noa. III-V) have so far been discovered, with dates ranging from A.D. 1110 to 1143, those, two were found at Sevadl in the temple of Mahavira and the third at Ball in the temple of Bola or Bahuguna mata. The last speaks of him as subsisting on the lotus-like feet of the Maluirajadhiraja Jayasiha, We have already seen that up to the time of Jojala, brother of Asvaraja,the Mai-war Chahamanaa were constantly at war with the CBaulukyas. They were couaoquectlytill then not subordinate to the Chaulukyas, but owed fealtyto some other .su promo puvvoi'.

HISTORY OF THE MlRWAR CHAHAMiNAS. 
All records epigraphic -and bardic agreein looking upon Lakshmana as the founder of the MarwSr branch of the ChshamSnas, The Nadol platesof Klrtipala3 'inform ns that in the town of Sakambhari, i.e. Ssmbhar in the Jodhpnr State, there was formerly,in the Chahamana lineage, king Vakpatirsja, and his son was Lakshmana, who was king afc Naddula (Nfidol). This Vakpatiraja was, in all likelihood, the Chahamana king of that name mentioned as the grandfather of Vigraharaja, for whom we have an inscription dated V.E. 1030 in a temple on <he Harsha hill in the Sekhavati province of the Jaipnr Sfcate> No record of Lakshmana has as yet oome to light. But on the Suraj-pol at Nadol da an inscription of the time of Kelnana, dated V.B. 1223, which incidentally mentions the name Lakhasa and the date Y.E. 1039 for him.5 The 1'atter thus appearsto have made some conqnests lor himself in Gadvad and established himself at Nadol where his memory is still preserved. Tha Svtraj-pOl jnsfc alluded to is said to h*v been erected byhim. The fort of N4l also bears his name, snd he fc supposed to have constructed it. In his Annals ond^ Antiq*\ttes of RaficMth&nP Colonel Tod, saya ;4<I presented to the Royal Asiatic Society two inscriptions from Nadole, -one dated S. 1024, the other 1039. They are of Prince Lakha, and state as instances of his power, that he collected the transit duties at the farther barrier of Pntnxx, and levied tribute from the princeof Cheetore," Bnt it is by no means clear how far Tad's statement as to. the. oontents. of these, inscriptionsis to be trusted. 
Lakshmana's son was Sobhita, also called Sdbhtta and Sdhiya. He is represented in the Sundha hill inscription to have taken awaytte gloryof the lord of HimUdiribhava, '.<. Aba,7 From him sprang Balirsja, who is representedin the same inscriptionto have defeated an of MunJMija. The latter must be the saiaeas the ParwnSr* Vakpatirsja II, AmSgha

I edit the following plates from two impressions kindlysent to me by Mr, D. H Bhandarkar, M.A., Archaeological Superintendent, Western Circle. The two impressions to getherleave no doubt as to the correct readingof theoriginal, with the exceptionof two names at the beginningof the second plate. In the case of these two names, theoriginal itself seems 
The plates were first fonnd in 1904-5 at TTavalakhl, near Shahapfir, a village about 8 or 10 miles from Juuagadh,and are now preservedin the Bahadur Museum, Juniigadh. They are two in number, eaoh inscribed on one side only. The edgesare fashioned into rims on the four margins. The plates appearto have been hold together bythickrings passing through two holes at the bottom of the first plate and at the topof the second. The holes are nearly }"in diameter, and seem to have been bored before the grantitself waa inscribed, The usual seal must have been attached to one of these copper rings, but as it is notforthcoming,Ipresume it has been lost. The plates measure about 10*8" by9'', The first bears 2] lines and the second 16. The averagesize of the letters is about Ty. 
The subjoined inscriptionis comparativelyfree from mistakes and differs in this respect from other records of the same dynasty, &g. the Rajkitt Museum platesof the same reigndated in Gupta-Samvat 290, published byDr. Biihler1(referred to in thesequelfor the sake of brevityas' the grant of 290 '}. The characters belongto the westernvarietyof the southern 
alphabets, As ivgards paleography,it is enoughto note that the aksbaras <ph and d\ are hardly digtinguished (e.g. Jiaryya-pJialah,1. 7, and ptt'hoiiud'ha^1. 14), The language is Sanskrit prosewith the exceptionof three imprecatoryyersea at the end. The rules of ta/ndU are followed in many places but neglectedin others. As regards orthography, the following points may be noted ;~ 
The latter ghis used instead of h in samghatis (1. 5), and samghat&rati (1. 11), The gutturalis used instead of the anusv&ra in chatvsrinfote (1, 25 ) accordingto the practiceof the Yajurvedi Brahmacaa in their Vedic recitations;and the dental n takes its placein 
&&awaanwa (for "twramsa) as is the practice with theGujariitiaof the present day. The final m of a word is changed onlyonce into the nasal of the class to which thefollowingletter belongsin t&mftoyafecka (I, 30), while in other cases it is generally changed into an anusvsrv, The letters tri in fftdfl%ttraQ(1. 6), and tri in trinavatf (1. 7) are both wrongand should be corrected bya reciprocal interchange, Consonants conjunct with the rephaare generally doubled (accordingto P&nm VIII, 4. 46) exqeptin the case of sibilants, e.g. darfayita (1. 11), and vwsha (1.

This inscription is 'one 6f the Paravnamaliesvara sri-Sfla'dity'a I. alias Dharmaditya, the son of sri-Dharasena, and grandsonof sri-Guhasena who belonged to the royal family fonnded by Bhatarkka. It is dated in the year 286 (A.D. 605) on the 8th day of the dark half of Ashadha. The date furnishes the numerical symbolsfor 200, 80, 6, and 8. The preamble1 of this grant, includingthe description of each one of the kings, is, as is quite natural, exactly the same as that of the grantof 290, referred to above.1 A comparisonof the copper-plate records of the family shows that SiladityaI. was the first king who omitted the names of the kings intervening between Bhatarkka,the founder, and Gnhasena, the grandfather of the present donor, -a practice which was subsequently adoptedin all the later grantsof this 
'family. 
T-he -subjoined inscription records the gift of a village called Bhondanaka, situated within the provincial limits of Vatanagara. I am not certain whether this Vatanagarais the same as Vadnagar in the Baroda State, or is the Vatapadrawhich Dr. Biihler took to be the modern Vadodra or Baroda.2 In any case, the village cannot be identified. The gift was made 
to forty- four Brahmanaa who had emigrated from Sarhgapnri, which is believed to be the sanu as the present Shahapur near Junagadh. The cause of the immigration is not recorded. Proba'bly they were induced to settle in this place by the present gift. 
The names of the BrShinanas are carious. Some look like surnames or family names, while others are clearly the names of particular individuals. The name Boppasvami may show 'that he was very likely a Tailaoga Braumana.3 Some are Prakrit forms of Sanskrit names, e.tj. Khanda=Skanda, Siha=8imha, Nattafai^Nartalta, Govasarmmti=Gopasarnima,'&B&\aoBhakkiwhich seems to be derived from B'hartri. The last name is familiar as the one borne also bythe author of the Bhatti-kavya.It is probablethat the names Bappataka, Navuvaka, Khokkhaku,, Gimjaka, and Goggaka are also similar in origin, thoughI am unable to suggest the precise derivation^ Other names are pure Sanskrit. Vatsa is a gotraor family namo of several Brahmanas even at present. The names DrOna, Bhatti, Aditya, Blmdra, Bappataka and GOpa appear to belong to more persons than one amongthe donees of the present grant, and hence the individual of the same name subsequently mentioned is distinguished from the first named person, by prefixing dm, tri as may be required. The prefixes mean, I believe, the second and the third.5 
'the following officials are mentioned m the grant: - 
(a) ^ttfeafea/ This word appearsto be veryold being found in Panrni 11. 3, 40, where it signifies a person appointedto some small work of a special character, and from the nature of the example givenin the Kaumudi to illustrate the rule,it seems probable that these may be Brahmanas employedfor religious or charitable pur 
poses,such as the pujarisor the worshippersat temples, etc., or the asritas, i.e. the learned men patronised bythe kingfor holymerit. 
1 [The text follows more closely the Wala plates of SiludityaI. dated in Gupta-Safhvat286. Ed.] 2 Tbe fact that the grant of 290 records the names of several villages endingin arnica, gives greater pro bability to the second alternative. The fame, however, of Vadnaga*as an early residence of Brahma^as is yet pre served in the name of the local caste of Briihmanas, and hence ono feels inclined to the first supposition.I caundt decide the matter for want oi more accurate information. 
8 Comparfe the naine of BSpadeva, the grammarian. 
* It fo not unlikely that they arc derived from the names of the Tillages to which their famUies originally belonged. The name GuUlalUa^i (1. 20) may be traced to GoHlwftd^rantaof Kathiawad. 6 This leads to the inference that these may be family names. It is worthyof remark that among these name* we recognise two of the modern onea of the Kokanaatha families, viz. Bapa^ and Bbanu. These are now met with only amongst the so-called Dakshinl Brahmanas and I believe are not to he found amongstthe original residents

mo, however, that all such dues accruing from tlie -village are mentioned bythe adjective sadhanyahirauyadeya)}. Hence it seems preferable to take the first three adjectives as referringto the descriptionof the gift. 
savatabMtapratyayaJi.Several grantsread pra ty ay ah instead of pratyayah, The mean ing of both seems to be nearlythe same. The compound word may be translated by' as determined by wind and other marks of the limits of a, place.' I am fcoid that this word is actually used in the Ntwm.ad&mfihai'inya to signifyfclie extent of the region on either bank as belongingto the Narmadii, where the distinctive breeze from the river is recognised. The boundary marks are, broadly speaking, described by Nfirada,1quotedin many other smritis, as fivefold : viz. (1) huge trees or mountains; (2)rivers or tanks, (3) underground signs, (4)artificial marks made by men, and (5) bythe order of the king, It is, I believe, to all these that this adjective refers. See, however, Dr. Biihicr's note on the word (Ind. Ant. Wl. IV, p. 106). He understands the word as referringto certain dues from the village. Dr. Fleet also, in his Gupta Inscriptions, p. 170, note 9, appearsto agree with Dr. Biihler. 
sadlianyahiranyadfiyafiis clearly' together with the revenues in grain and gold.' sadasaparadhdfy' with the rightto the fines for the ten offences,' see Gupta Imcriptum, p. 189, note 4.

- aKastapraJcsJiepamyali. This word is equivalentto the Marathi idiom hfita ghalane (lit. to put one's hand in a matter). The phrase, therefore, should be rendered 'not to be meddled, with' by any of the royalofficers. 
IbamichchUdranyayena. 'accordingto the principleof a hole in the earth.1 This popular maxim is variously explaino^ by Dr. Bhandarkar {Iiul.'Ant. Vol. I.p. 46) and by Dr. Biihler (iUd. Vol. IV. p. 10G, note). In the uncertainty thus caused I may propose a third explanation. The word- usuallyoccurs after pftrvapratta'devabrahmadeyavarjitafyt tliough sometimes without it, and is to bo connected grammaticallywith nisrishtah. that follows. It appears from this that, both these words signify the reservations from the gift. The previousattribute having reserved the giftsto temples or Brahmanas previously made, this word seems to reserve the rightof the grantorto the mineral resources and treasure trove, etc. The rightof the kingto these3 is always urged againsta gift unless it is expressly transferred. The word, therefore, may reserve this rightin favour of the royal donor in spiteof the gift of the land. 
The word dutaka (1. 34)is translated by some as' messenger.' Seeing, however, that in several cases, princes of the royal blood are styledin this manner, I believe this must he a^res ponsible officer who had to attest such tssanas as required by the Smritis. In Manu VII, 63-5 the duta, is spoken of as a chief minister in special confidence with the king. His counsel waa always sought on matters of utmost importancelike peace and war.

The word divirapatfi seems to signify the head-clerk or at the most the chief secretaryof the king. According to the Smritis. a sasana had to be in the handwriting of the clerk whose business was to draft the important orders of peace and war; so it must be such an officer who is spoken of as divlrapati.

No, 19. THE SIUPUR STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OP MAHASIVA GUPTA.* 
Br RAI BAHADUR HIBA LAL, B.A., NAGPCTR. 
Sirpur is a small village on the right bank of the Mahanadi in the Mahasamunda tahsil of the Raipar District iu the Central Provinces. It is 37 miles north-east of Raipnr and 15 miles from Arang. Sirpur waa once the capitalof Maha-Kosala3 and was then known as Sripura,3 as given in the stone inscriptions found there, and also in the copper plates found in Rajinr4 and Baloda. 5 The rujus in and around the village indicate that ifc was ouce a gieat city and there are scores of temple sites, the identification of which is now rendered im possible by the removal of the idols they contained to a place near a brick temple, which IB the only one now standingas it was originallybuilt. It is popularly known as the' Lakshmana temple.' Writing of the bricka with -which it is built, Mr, Cousens who visited it in 1904 remarked6 that they were of a finer make than any he had till then seen, either ancient or modern. They are moulded and carved with, considerable artistic skill. About a third of the temple tower was gone, while the mandapa had totally collapsed and was a heapof ruins when it was taken under Government conservation. It was while removingthe debris of this man dapa that the subjoined inscription was found and removed to the Raipur Museum, where it is at present deposited. Sir A. Cunningham visited Sirpurin 1881-82 and noticed all the inscrip tions he found there, remarking that one of them must belongto this temple. He was rightin supposing that the temple must have had gome inscription but it had not come to light then and it was about 2 years7ago that it was accidentally discovered. 
It is perhaps the biggest inscription yefc found in Sirpur.It is engraved on a thick reddish stone, which is not exactlv rectangular,the breadth of the upper corner being3' 8V and that o the lower 3' 9", while the height at the right side is 2' 3|" and at the left 2' 1|". "The writing covers a space 3' 8" by 2' 1". There are altogether 26 lines of writing, but some parts of the stone coming in contact with others have peeled off, aad portionsof lines 3, 4, 5, 6 at the left hand top corner and the last 4 lines have been partially damaged. The characters are Nagarl, beautifully engraved, their average height being f". They belong to the Northern class of alpha beta of about the 8th or 9th century A.D. The most noticeable peculiarities are the antiquated forms of the letters i, na, sa, dha, that lha, and ja. The matra of a is represented bya top stroke, and e by a small stroke prefixed to the letter. The sign of u is added in the middle of the letter ret as usual, but when made long it is bent upwards as in gurupacJiaranein line 7 and -r&paify in line 12, In the case of the short ru in Purushsttama in line 1, the bend is upwards instead of down wards, but this is probably a mistake as other short rus have it in the usual way downwards. The signs for ft and % when joinedto a class letter appearto be identical : compare punjain line 1 and mandanam in line 12. Forms of final m occur in 11. 4, 11, 12, 13 and 14 and of and n in 11. 6 and 16 respectively.8 The language is excellent Sanskrit, highly rhetorical, containing 42 verses in various metres. 
The record consists of two parts, me. a eulogyin 23 verses and rules for the temple management from line 16 to the end. The inscription begins with an invocation to PurushOttama, which is in prose. The first three verses are devoted to the praise of the Nrisimha or man-lion incarnation of Vishnu. King Maha&Lvagupta, his mother and two ancestors

(father and grandfather), are nest mentioned. The historical information -which is here f arnislied la that, in the lunar race, there was a hero whose name is illegible (v. 4). His sou was Harsha gupta (v. 9). From him was born Mahasivagtipta (v. 12) who was also known as Balarjuna owing to his proficiency in the use of arms (v. 13). He apparently had a younger brother named Rana!kesarm (v. 12). We are then informed that his mother, named Vasata (V. 15), "vras the daughter of Suryavarma, kingof Magadha (v. 16). She became a widow (v. 17) and caused to be constructed a templeof Hari (v. 20), the same to -which this inscription was affixed. She and her acts are praisedin seven verses (vv, 17 to 28). 
The writer of this enlogy\vho calls himself prasastikarah kavifj, was Chintaturanka Isana (v. 24)1, who in the second part proceedsto lay down the regulationsfor the management of the temple as follows : Five villages,viz. Todankana, Madlmvedha, Nalipadra, Kurapadra, and Vanapadra, were given (v. 25) for the maintenance of the temple to which apparently a sattra, or an almshonse was attached. The villages were divided into four shares, three of which (subdivided into three separate parts) were to "be reserved for the maintenance of the almshouse, repairs (to the temple) and for the supportof the servants attached to the sanctuary (v. 2(?). The fourth share was divided into fifteen parts,of which twelve were to be enjoyed by a corre sponding number of Brahmanas fully conversant with the Vedas, each of the three Vedas (Rik, "STajus and Saman) havingfour experts. The remaining three parts were to be enjoyed by a sacrificial priest and two others who were Bhagavatas.3 The names of these fifteen personsare fluly recorded and it is enjoinedthat their descendants should inherit the giftif properly qualified for it, otherwise the grant should goto some other relatives bytheir own selection and not by order o? the king (vv. 27 to 34). An additional village named Vargullaka is stated to have been given separately to the god himself,for meetingthe expensesof offeringsto him (v. 36). The engraver was a certain Arya G-onna (v. 35), the same who wrote the slab built fiat into the pavement of the new work outside the court wall of the GandhesVara templeat Sirpur.3 
Like other inscriptionsof Sirpurthis is also undated, and therefore its agecan only be deter mined from its characters, which, as stated before, belongto the 8th or 9th century A.D. Mahasivaaupta who is mentioned in almost all the inscriptions so far found in Sirpur, seems to have been a temple-builder,or at least he encouragedothers to build them. Apparently he -was a Saiva, although his mother was a Vaishnava and so was his father who is described in verse 20 as wp&sitsdhyutafy,i.e. by whom Vishnu was worshipped. From an inscription4 in the temple of Gandhesvara ^correctly Gandhsrvesvara as givenin an inscriptionaffixed to the parapet there) we know five ancestors of Mahas'ivagupta,so that our inscription gives no additional information about the family, as it onlytakes us back to his grandfather. But verse 6 leads us to the important inference that Mahasivagupta's grandfather [Chandragupta] had an elder "brother wk> was the king's commander in chief. This elder brother cannot I suppose be any other than the Tlvaradeva of the Rajim and Baloda plates. He was the Bon of Nannadeva, Chandragupta's father. Tivaradeva's inscriptions, were issued from Sripura and he is described as being the ' supreme lord of Kosala',5 He had apparently no issue and his brother probably eucceeded him. A -second historical fact to be. gleaned from our inscriptionis the disoovery of one additional name in the line of Yarma kingsof Magadha,via. Suryavarma who must 
have flourished about the 8th century A.D. He apparently belongedto the Western Magadha dynasty. He must have been a contemporaryof Chandragupta,to whose son Harahagupta he gave his daughter in marriage. 
Attention may be called to the name Eanakesarin (in verse 12)wlio would appear to have been a younger brother of Mahaiivagupta, althoughthe word has teen used in a double sense. Dr. Kielhorn6 has drawn attention to this name with a view to show that names

ending in Kesarin were not foreignto this familyas a curious coincidence between the Sirpnr kings and the Orissa Kesari family. The second name of Bhavadeva who. Dr. Kielhornsays,1 was' a cousin, of Indrabala's son Narraadeva, the father of both Tivaradeva and Chandragnpta,* was also Ranakesarin, but "we meet it in the direct line here. In spite of the overwhelming palBeographic evidence2 which tends to disprove anyconnection between the Sirpnr dynasty and that of the SSmavaiiisi kings of Katak (or more correctlyof Vimtapura or Yayatinagara), in both of which a Sivagupta occurs, it seems possible that General Cunningham may still proveto have been rightin linking' them together, although the dates assigned to them by him are all wrong.3 The kiogsof Sirpur appear to have been ousted "by the kings of Saralbhapura,4 which place has not been identified as yet.5 The inscriptions of the latter lave beeu found in the country round about and in close vicinity of Sirpur, viss^ at AraBg-, Raipur, Khariar and Sarangarh which enclose Sirpnr from all directions, north, south, east and west. I have alreadyidentified several of the villages mentioned in them (see above, Vol. IX. p. 283) and their position shows that a very large portionof the present Ohhattisgarh Division came under their sway. Probably they could not conquer the whole of Maha-Kosala which extended from the confines of Berar to the boundary of the K"atak District, The Sirpur dynasty having been driven further east settled in some place on the bauk of the Mahauadl. Theystill continued to rule at least a partof Kdsala. That seems to be the reason why theycontinued to call themselves' Lord of KSsala'unwilling to show a reduced front. They had probablylost the western portionof Maha-Eosala for ever, and that seems to be the reason why most of the villages granted by them aro 
situated in the SambalpurDistrict and the adjoining feudatorystates of Patna and Sonpur. The Sirpur dynasty probably regainedits former power but could not regainthe lost kingdom, as although the Sarobhapnra kings seem to have fallen as quicklyas they rose, they were succeeded by another rising power,the Haihayas of Tummana, who eclipsed the chiefs of the whole of Chhattisjjarh and extended their dominions still farther. 
Dr. Fleet assigns the characters of the records of the Somavams'I kingsof Katak to the eleventh century aud says that even if a somewhat earlier period than what has been arrived at, should be hereafter established for Sivagupta and hia successors of the Katak line, the paljeo graphic changes in so many details appear more than can possibly be covered by the lapse of a fiingle generation.? His conclusion is that the kings mentioned in these inscriptions' are to be placed somewhere between A.D. 10CO and 1100.'8 Since the characters of the Sirpur inscriptions are believed to belong to about the 9th century,it would appearthat Dr. Fleet would place an interval of a little more than 100 yearsto account for the palsspgraphicdifficulties. This is a period "which, may easily be covered bythree generations, and on examiningthe genealogicaltable made out from the records of the Ssmavamsi kings as given byDr. Fleet,9it seems to me that a link of two generations is at present missing, which further discoveries might bring to light,

* fMahaaudeva of Sarabhapurahas been assigned by Mr. Hiralal to about the 8th century (above, VoL IX. p. 283), And Tivaradeva., Prof. Kielhorn has assigned without hesitation to the middle of the 8th century.If these two approximate dates are correct, the usurpation by the Sarabhapura kings would hare taken placeat a time when the Sirpur kings must have been powerful.

5 It may perhaps have been a new name imposed on the conquered city of Sripura by the victor from the fabulous animal of that name, who is believed to be a match for a lion, with reference to the claim of the Sirpur dynasty to be Kesaris (lions),

There are four kings in this list, but there are only two names, ws. Sivagupta and Bhavagupta,1 Three of them, have a second name -which may have been their birth-names or titles. The Sivagupta of our inscription had also a second name, i.e. Balarjuna. This Balarjuna Sivagupta may possibly be the grandfather of the titleless Sivaguptaof the Katak inscriptions, By the way it may be noted that his granduncle Tivaradeva who was king was also called Mahasiva as stated m the Balcda and Rajim plates.3 I suppose that the title of Earshagupta must have been Mahabhavagupta, and anyfurther discoveries giving both the names would, I venture to think, confirm this surmise. So we can trace back the official title of Mahasiva up to Tivarvadeva at least and he was possibly great-great-granduncleof the first Sivaguptaof the Sornavamil records. According to this view the genealogicaltree of the amalgamated iSirpur and Katak Gupta dynasty would be as under :

EPIGRAPHIA INDJCA. [TQL. XI.   
The Sirpur inscriptions show that Balarjuna IMahasivagupta must have been in a fairly prosperousstate and so it was probablyhis son, a possible Mahabhavagupta, who was ousted fiotn his ancestral capital. If we do not find any of Ms records, there is nothing to wonder at. A person in calamity driven oat of his home would hardly think of bestowing grants or revel in perpetuating his name when his own petition was so shaky, and bis descendants would hardly be inclined to mention one "who was in such a plight,it being better to omit than to record his tale of defeats.1 For the matter of that, they might also have omitted his son Sivagupta's name as he also does not seem to have been in a much better position, but he was the direct ascendant of his renowned son, and it is possible that he might have preparedthe way to the conquest of Trikalmga of which all his successors are called adhipati, though no such title attaches to his name in any of the inscriptions.It appearsthat it was Jariamejaya Mahabhavagupta (I) who retrieved the good name of his dynasty by conqueringthe Trikalinga country. So far as is known, he was the first in his line to take the title of Trikalingadhipati, though it was disputed by the Haihaya kings of Chedi, as we find the title used bythe Jvalachuri Karnadova of Tripurl in his Benares plate of 1042 A.D.2 and byother members of the same family up to 11 74 A.D. Eat they were apparently raiders with superior power,the real rulers of Trikalinga beino- the Somavamsis, There is little doubt that these two houses came in contact with each other as in one of the Patna plates (marked H) the donor claims a victory over Chcdi. 
With regard to geographical names, the countryof Magadha whence the temple builder was brought in marriage is well known. The other places mentioned are 6 villages o-iven to the temple and its accessories, Of these, I think Karapadrais the same as Kulapadar, 15 miles south-east of Sirpur, and Vargullakais apparently G-ullu, about 10 miles south-west of Sirpur and 5 from Arang. Tfidankana may be Turenga near Kulapadar. Aliout 4 miles from Turenga there is a village named Madhuban which may be identical with Madhuvedha of the inscription. As regards the remaining two, Nalipadra and Vanapadra, I could not find any villages answering to their names. Vanapadra must have been quito close to Sirpur, as it is stated to be con the spot'. 
An endeavour has been made in the appendedstatement to identify places mentioned iu other records of these kings, and it may not be out of place here to discuss the unsettled question of the capital of these kings. In the records of the Somavamsis the phrase ' srtmato vijaya-KataJcat' occurs which has been interpreted to mean' from the victorious ELataka', the capital, in preferenceto its simple meaning 'from the victorious camp'. That the latter is the real meaning clearly appears from the copper plates3 of Mahabhavagupta Janamejaya belonging to the 3rd year of his reign (the oldest of all so far found), in which the word sJcandhavarat has been used instead of the usual katakat. It will be observed from other inscriptions that whenever kataka is used, the name of the camp (a sepa rate place-name) ia invariably4given, but this is not the case when the charters purport to be issued from Tayatinagara or Vimtapura, which Dr. Fleet considers to be fanciful names of Kataka itself, It has been assumed that Kataka was the capitalof these kings, but I am 
1 Another reason why his name is omitted may be found ia the fact that all the records of this dynasty give only the name of the donor aad his father iu the ordinarybusinesa-like way, and since his son Sivagupta for reasons atated further on in-the text probably never made a grant, it seems very doubtful whether we would ever get a direct proof of his existence,

3 These plates were found some 13 years ago at Sonpur, the capital of the state of the same name. They were shown to me when I visited that place about 12 years ago (i.e. 1896) and I took a copyof the inscription. [They have been published by Mr. Mazumdar (above, pp. 98 ff.). Ed.] 
4, There is only one exception found in the Patna plates marked H in which Vinltapura and Kataka are both mentioned ; but Mr. Laskar has noted that this record is full of mistakes and gross inaccuracies. See J. 4, ft. J2. 1905, Tol. I. p. 6.

unable to share this view. The question, has already bfen discussed byother scholars,1 and the identification of Yayatinagarawith the modem Jajpur has been suggested, hut Dr. Fleet3 has pointed out that this suggestionis untenable as tho inscriptions distinctly imply that Yayatiuagara was ou the Mahanadi, whereas Jajpuris only on the Va.itar.ani, about 50 miles awtiy from the former river. 
The cams Yayatinagara was apparently imposed upon Vinrtapura duringthe reignof Yayati otherwise known as Mahasivugupta.It is noteworthythat prior to his time" the name Yayatiua gara does not occur in any inscriptions. In fact he himself used the older name Vinitapurain the records of the 8th aud 9th yearsof his reign, which fact shows that till then the idea of naming the town after himself had not occurred to him. It -was probably somewhere between the 15th and 24th yearof his reign that the town changed its name. Since then the official name sesrna to have become Yayatinagara, and we have in all four inscriptions mentioning1 it, two of which belong to the 24th and 2Sth years of his own. reign, and two to the 3rd and 13th yearof his son's. This name apparently continued to be used as longas Vinitapura was thecapital,at least in official circles, but as is well known the original name usuallysticks so persistentlyin the popular mind that it is difficult to eradicate it. Many a monarch has endeavoured to changethe names of big cities after his own, but the old name has usuallyasserted the ground, and I suppose the same happenedwith Vinltapura, which name can now be traced in the corrupted form Binka. Thia is a small town in the Sonpur State,16 miles north of the present capital of that state. It fulfils all the conditions appertainingto Vinitapura.It is on the bank of the Malianadi, and the river scenery there ie as beautiful as described in the inscriptions. From Sirpur it is about 100 miles as the crow flies and about 180 byriver quite a safe distance to which, the ousted family might have removed itself. The two placesare so situated that if one fled straight to the east he would meet Biuka as the first place on the MahanadI, as between these two places the river flows in a. curved Binka, moreover, is central to all the camps from which the kings issued their charters. Of the 13 so far discovered, 5 were issued from the capital itself, 3 from a pleasure garden, which must have been somewhere in the big grovesstill to be seen on the outskirts of Binka, 3 were issued from Murasima or the present Mursinga ID the Patna state, about 11 miles from Binka, one from SoTipur, and one from Vamaadapati41 or Bamra, 60 miles to the north-east, but this last was issued bya feudatory from his own head quarters, and he has mentioned his overlord's capital as Yayatinagara. The villages grauted so far as they have been identified are situated close to and round about Binka as a glance on the accompanying map will show.5 The existence of: a village named Rajpall (meaning royal hamlet) within a mile of the present Binka town is significant. There are also remains of a fort close by and a ghat embankment on the Mahanadi. 
i See above, Vol. VIII. p. 139 (where Professor Hultzsch prefersto take fcofafct iu the sense of 'a camp ') and J. A. 8. JB., 1905, Vol. I., pp. 2 and 3. 
a Above, Vol. III. p. 355. 
5 My idea is that when Balarjuna's successor was driven out from Sirpurhe fled straightoff to the east and settled at a spot where he first met the sacred Mahanadi whoae waters had sanctified generationsof his ancestors. To this obscure place he in his dejection gave the appropriate name of Viultapuraor the 'town of the humbled.' I feel this is rather fanciful, as at this distance of time it is difficult to read the motives which actuated the founder to name the town in that way, and all that can be said is, that the explanationis plausihle. 
4 It may be noted that Bamra is still called Bamanda bythe Oriya peopleof Sambalpur. *It is remarkable that there are amongst the donees Brahmana immigrants from Madhyadela and even distant Sravasti in Oudh. Their advent to this remote place may easily be explained bythe fact that Binka lay, as it does now, on the high road to JagannSth Purl, one of the four dUmas or the most saored places of India, which Hindus from all corners of the country visited as theystill continue to do. Some of these learned Pandits o the celebrated district of Sravasti might have been induced to settle there, either by solicitations of the ling or by necessity owing to the difficulty of crossing longdistances for want of good commuuicfttiona, accentuated by th<j dangers of the road which was infested byrobbers of all description,

No. 20. THE INSCRIPTION ON T1IK WAllHAK VAS.K. 
By F. E. PAKC.ITKK, M.A., I.f'.S. (.Krno 
The Wardak vase or urn wus found byM.HKSDU in UK- topes of Kliawat in tho district of Wardak in Afghanistan duringthe yearH 1KM-7. Jin r.-illcd the plarr Kohwufc and gave this description of it: "These tope.s avo situ.-iliid on tin: murm1 of i he riv<ir, which, having its source in the Hazai'ajait, flu \VB through Ijoghuvinto t! c plaino.'iht of Kabul, whoro it unites with the stream passing throughtho city.

He published his renderingof the inscription together with thu saiuo platoin J. A. S. B., 1S31, p. 337, to which Mr. Baylcy added a note (ibid, p. .'547). Prof, J, DOWBOU noxfc undertook the deciphermenu of this and other records in tho KharoHhi-hl character and publishedhie reeultfl together with the same platein J. R. A. S., 18G3, vol.

widest part,flr, Read tells me that it bears no traces of ever havingbeen gilt, but thatparts of the brass might have presented a brilliant appearancelike gold,if they had been protected by remaining in contact with certain earth wbile buried in the tumulus. 
The inscription ia in the Eharoshthi script and consists of two portions. The first IB written in three lines encircling the shoulder of the vase; and the second consistingof one line is written atouad tho broadest part of the vase below the former and separated from it bythree lines, and occupies not quite half the circumference. The first is the main portion and is in letters varying generally from |to finch in height. In the fourth line or second portion the letters are about | inch longer and correspondinglybroad. Theyare formed of minute dents pricked into the metal, and the dents are so close togetherthat from 8 to 10 aregenerallycon tained in jinch in the first three lines, and from 7 to 8 in the last line, 
The two plates annexed hereto, giviug a facsimile of the record, have been prepared under Dr. Fleet's supervision from the ink-impressions which also were made under his direction. The shape of the part of the vase where lines 1 and 2 lie is such that ink-impressionsof them can not be made without introducing a gapat some poiutor another; the placeselected was naturally that where the record begins, and a supplementary ink-impression, was made of that part of the record and has been reproduced below the completelines. It shows how the lines ran right round the vase without any blank spacein line 1, and with only a small spaceat the end of line 2, and gives in their complete forms the final ti of line 1 aud the initial i of line 2, which are not perfect in the circular impression. To have reproducedline 3 ia one piece would have entailed a somewhat cumbrous folding plate, hence it lia-i beeu treated in three parts over lapping each other;thus 3-B repeats the last six syllablesof 3 A, and 3 rspeats the last five syllablesof 3 B aud also shows at its end the Wta with which 3 A begins, A fourth piece 3 1) has been added to show how this lino also practically runs quite round the vase, and contains the last seven and the first eight letters of the line. 
The style of the script is that of tho Kushana inscriptions portrayed byBiihler in Table I of his hdische Pataogfrap/w, cols, x to xii. Further specimensof thescript havo been, published lately, namely, the Taxila plate byBiihler (B.I, iv, 54), the Taiila vase by Prof, Ltiders (E, L viii, 296) and the Mathura Lion capital byDr. P, W, Thomas (B.I. ii, 135). Mr. B. Thomas in discussing this inscription spokeof"tbe little care that has been taken to mark the nicer shades of diversity of outline which,in many cases, constitute the onlyessential difference between characters of but little varying form" (PnWep'a 18ttaystvol. I, p, 1(52). But it seems to me after a carefnl and detailed comparisonof the letters, that the inscription has been carefully made, the letters are generally well-formed, only a few clerical errors occur, and the distinctions between letters which are similar in shapeare generally expressed clearly1 eicept as regards two particular letterBj y and L For instance,t and r have the flame general shape, and are fairly well distinguished,in that the downward stroke of t is usuallyof abut the same length as the horizontal stroke, while in r it is generally about twice as long ; and in only one or two places is the difference neglected. No distinction is made between long and short vowels, and the only special form that need be mentioned is m in wfle (1. 1). 
The exception just referred to occurs in the letters y and ',and these are the onlyletter! that cause real uncertainty. Ordinarily y has a pointed top and if a flat top, but the distinction is very far from being observed here and ia indeed more often ignored ; especially since some times the top has an intermediate roundish form and sometimes the letters are distorted by 
^Characters should primarily be read as what ftey strictly appearto be, and the resultant words accepted snd scrutinized. This is essential in dealing with the endless diversities in the different kinds of Prakjiil, To Mid ckrwtera so as to agree with the commoner forms of the Prakrit words intended seems to bo slmoit ctrtua to obscure Prakrit modifications that may be important critically and lingmitically.

being tilted over to the right. We may confidently read yin iya Khavadamn (1. 1), ami A; in Sakya and sarira (1. 1), sava (1. 3 A) and sapliatiga (1. 3 B) ;but in all other instances i*'1K hardly possible to say positively, solely from the shapeof the letter, whether it is yor s, and regard must be had to the meaning. This is well illustrated by the word puyae vphH'h occurs thrice in 1. 2 and once in 1. 3 B. The y has a different shapein each of these place,? ;i" the last place it has undoubtedlythe form ofs,and in all the other placesits appearance is far more that of 5, than ofy.In all these instances then what looks like s is really // Hence it is clear we musb be preparedfor similar confusion in other passages where OHO f' r other of these letters is intended, and the decision mast rest mainly,if not entirely, on the aens. Thus we can read without doubt yin Artamisiyasa (I, 1) and in padiyamsam (11. 2 and 3 C) ; and s in the words kiisala (1. 2), mahisa (11. 2 and 3 B) and also in padiyamsam, There remain some words in which yor ^ is combined wifch a vowel mark or another consonant, and, since // is written sometimes with a flat or rounded top, there would be nothing surprisingif its topI'H made wide ia order to find room where the vowel marks i and o have to be inserted, so thtifc yi and yd would then look like si and so. Accordingly y and not s appearsto be the correct reading in kad&layigra (1, l) } $aryata (1. 3 &), jalayuga (1. S B), and yo adra (1. 3 A); while ,v is right in tocha (1. 2) ;while what looks like asamsrana (1, 4)is doubtful. These words will bn discussed in the Notes infra. 
The characters for 6 and v require some notice. F proper approximatesto the character for 6, but they are distinguishedin that the topline is flat in v and is curved upwards on the left side in 6. Thus we have v initial in vagra (thrice, U. 1,2) and vihara (11. 1, 4) and medial in lhavagta (1. 3 A) and avashatri (1. 3 0) ;while o occurs in llwadala (1. 2) and nabagra (1. 3 A) ;and in conformity therewith it is proper to read 6 rather than t? in paridliabeti (1.I ). Another character is found for what is properly va, which occurs onlyas a medial and is evi dently distinguished from va proper,for it is always small and without the stroke to the left at the bottom. It is used in bhavalu always,also in bliagravada (1. 1) and pariv&ra (1. 3 C), and apparently in Ehavadamri (1. 1). This difference in shape may denote a difference in value, and this small form may perhapshave had the sound of 20. 
No distinction appearsto be recognized between the letters n and n. A slight difference may be perceived between the character in menu (I, 1) and mulena (1. 2) and that in Hashtwia (1, 2) and avashatrigana (1. 3 0) ;and that constitutes the difference which Biihler has shown in his Table I, cols, x and xi; but his form of n occurs here, not onlyin words where it should properly appear as in sarvina and Rohana (1. 3 B), but also in words where it is inadmissible as in mem (1. 1), mulena (1. 2) and satvana (1. 3 A). There appearstherefore to be no real distinction observed between and n, and this is what Prof. Liiders has noticed in his paper on the Taxila vase (E.I. viii, 297). 
A letter that presents some difficultyis that which I read as di in gadigxena (1. 1) and padiyamSam (twice 11. 2, 3 C). It is one and the same in all three places, for its form in the firat and second places is identical, and, though it varies somewhat in the third place, yetit occurs therein precisely the same expression agrabhaga pafoyamsam as in the second, and must be the same in these two places.1 Hence it musk be read the same in all. It is certainly 
1 The letter has a tail or stroke to the right at the bottom 5 in the first two placesthe stroke is a straight line and in the third an upward curve. The difference seems to be intentional. In discussing the r stroke ttt/h* (p. 206) I have pointed out the difference made in it in the two portionsinto which the inscription must he divided, namely, the straight r stroke does not denote a real r in the first portion but does so in the second. The first two instances of this letter occur in the first portion, and its tail being made straight there like the unreal r could not create a misunderstanding ; but in the third instance, which occurs in the second portion, that straight 
trob might lave suggested a real r stroke, andmisunderstandinghas been avoided by turningthe tail into a curve, which has DO special significance in the second portiop (though it does renpreseat a real r in the first portion).No. 2.]TEE INSCRIPTION ON TEE WARDAK VASE, 205   
not n. M, Senart has taken it as ti and Prof, Liiders as trt, thustheyread the word as patiawscte and patriyam&ae respectively;1 but I do not think it is ti or in, because the right shoulder of the character is carried upwardsfar higher than in all other instances of the letter f,2 and it differs from the genuineti found in pwidhabeti (1, 1), rajoft&aja, afw/ra, 
saniblwti (1. 2) aud saphatiga (1, 3B), and from the in found in avasliatri (1. 30). There is no other letter that it resembles exceptd and dh, which are figured in Biihler's Table I and in Dr. Thomas's Table IV (B.I. ix, 146). The word is evidently the same as in agrapatiasae on the Manikyala stone,iu agrapratyasataye (E, I, i, 890, ncXVIII)and in agreb'havQ.'pratymfa'fayiiBtu (E. I, i, 240)as noticed by M, Senarfc and Prof. Liidors.8 Since this letter corresponds to the first t in those words,it cannot he dU and canonly be ditwhich in 
this Prakrit represents that t as will be explained (p. 208). This then is a modified or new form of d. 
A character occurs, which must apparently be a final anusvara, in the word padiymtam (11. 2, 3 C). M, Senart and Prof. Liiders have read it as e as noticed above, but S occurs iu Wiagvae and pwj/ae" (11.23 3B) and dachUnae (1. 3A)aud is whollydifferent from this letter, so that it cannot be e. Moreover, it is quitedifferent from the e in agrapatiafas on the Manikyala stone.4 All the letters in the KharOshthI script have been figured byBiihler in his Table I and by Dr. Thomas in his Table IV (E.I. ix, 146) exceptn, This character is like none of those, nor can it be n which never occurs as a final in Prakrit. The onlyother sound for which no separate character has been met with is m standing by itself as a final, Anusyara is generally denoted bya leftward curve added to the bottom of a consonant as in sam (1, 1), samWiati (1, 2), amtara (1.3 A)and thrice in 1. 4; but, if it should be difficult or inconvenient to add the curve to certain characters, such as k, Iu or 7w, Bnal m could only be expressed by some independent sign, so that presumablythere must have been some character to deuote it in such cases;and it appearsto be this character. The construction of the sentence supportsthis inference. It is notnecessaryto suppose that the dative is intended after llmntu here, for the construction with Ih&vatu is clearly changed afterwards to the nominative, as in agra ItJiaga blmatu (1. 3 0), and here the construction is evidently similar. Padiyamsamis obviouslythe nominative to bhav&tu which follows it in both places; and, as its termination is not masculine norfeminine,it must be a neuter nominative ending in m (see p. 209), This character can hardlydenote a final m because m does not occur as a final in Prakrit, as far as I know, exceptin poetry where a short syllable is required or before a vowel,5 and neither of these conditions exists here; yet it would come practically to the same result if this character be read as final m. 
A letter occurs which appearsto be a new form of $h,It is discussed in the note on the word faphatiga, (1, 3 B), infra, p,217. 
As regards compound letters, we have M in Arta? (1. 1), ryin paryda (1, 3 A),fa or ryin asmfrana (1. 4), shit in JJoveshhsya (1. 2) and ski in EasUuna, (1, 2). jfo occursplainlyin sarva, (1, 3 A) and the first sarvina,(1.3 B), and is apparently intended by the similar character without the loop in the second sarvinn (I, 3 B).

The letter yas the second member of a cotnpoimd letter is well illustrated here, being formed by a right ward hook added to the tail of the first member as in arupyuta (1. 3 B). Since the tail is often curved to the left, the addition of the ho!c gives the appearance of a double cnrre as in Kamagulya (1. 1) and tyain Mikyngasija (1. 3 G),or even a triple curve as in Sakya 
(1. 1), This conjoint y-markis added to another letter which resembles d or nthut the com pound can only denote syin the genitive termination s>ja because of its position.. It is best formed in masya (1. 1), Hoveskkusya (I. 2), Vntjra Mare,/rasija (1. '2} and Milyugasya, (I. 3 0), somewhat variant in Eashtuna Uaregvasya (1. 2), and badly shapedin Afart'iji-asya (I. 1). 
The mark for r as the second member of a compound letter is a stroke to the right a'tached to the lowest point of the first member. It occurs often and raises some interesting questions. Dr. Thorns-., found on the Mathura Lion-capital that conjunctr is so represented and alo in two other ways, namely, bya similar stroke to the left and by a dot (E.I. ix, 137). The clot is 
not so used in this inscription. The stroke fco the left occurs often, but has no significance ; thus (to citeoaly a few instances) it is added to an initial a sometimes as in Artamisiyasa (1. 1), agra sometimes (11. 2, 3) and arupynta (1. 3 B):to the first ja hut not the two others in malia raja rajatiraja (1. 2) and to bha in bhavatu sometimes but not always ill. 2, 3). These illus trations also shew that it cannot denote the doublingof a letter, nor a distinction between the vowels a and a, nor the vowel u or ri. It seems to be a mere flourish in finishing the tails of letters written from rigfht to left. 
This stroke to the rig-ht occurs chiefly with the letter ga, which representsthe suffix ka nud ia thus a very common termination'and a veryuseful criterion for dividingthe words. It occurs with t in avashatri (L 3 C),thrice with d in pudra (1. 1), midra (1. 2) and adra (I. 3 A),1 and once with bh in bhradaba (1. 2), In all tbeae words, except perhapsthe first, this r stroke represents a real r, and it is onlyin, conjunctionwith g that uncertaintyarises. 
The letter g occurs both with and without this r stroke. The downward line of g ends straight in jalayuya (1. 3 B) and bliaga (twice in 1. 3 G), and has the slight leftward flourish in arogci (1, 3 A), faphatiga (1,3 fy t avashatrigana and Mityagasyn (1. 3 0), and samgfiigana (I, 4). In all other places the right ward stroke appears, and in discussingit we must divide the inscrip tion into two parts, the first part down to bhrtvagva, (I. 3 A) and the second comprisingthe remainder. In the first partit haq two shapes ; first, a horizontal stroke more or less straight, as in gajigvena, kadalayigva, Marigra and bhagravada1*(1, 1), Maregrasya (11. 1, 2), bhagrae, natigra, eaatbhatigrana and bhagra (1. 2), nabagra and btiavagra (1 3 A) ; and secondly, an up ward curve which appears alwaysin Vagra (11. 1, 2) and agra (I. 2 twice). In the first part then the curved form represents a genuiner in agra and apparentlyalso in Vagra, and the straight form is used in all the other cases and always incorrectly, for even in 'Maregra and Marigra the jra probably does not contain a real r. In the second part, however, tie r stroke is never added to g exoepfc where there is a real r, as in agra (1. 3 C) and parigraha (1. 4), and then it is denoted by the straighthorizontal stroke which ia the correct form. 
It appears therefore that it was discovered while the record was beinginscribed on the vase, that the straight r stroke was being improperly inserted, and that the fault was corrected &fter the word bhavagra ;hence the difference between the first and second parts. The horizon tal form, which is the correct sign,is used with gin the second part, and with all other conao nvita throughout the inscription, wherever a real conjunctr occurs; but in the first parta dis tinction was made in the case of g, the horizontal stroke being improperly employed to represent an unreal r, and the carved form being used to denote a real r. This peculiarity was discovered and rectified after the word bhavagraas mentioned. That word occurs in the middle of what seems to be a poetical quotation (see p. 218). Was it some discussion about the quotationthat

rimed the question of orthography ? Thus it might haw been noticed that the addition of the unreal r vitiated the metre, as it certainly does in that word. Whatever be theexplanation,it is certain that there is a difference in the use of the r-stroke with gin the two portions. 
The persistent and incorrect addition of the horizontal r stroke tog throughout the first pait cannot however be accidental, but must have some significance; and suggeststhat it denoted a modification ofg. Such a modification could hardlybe anythingelse than to give the aonnd of . After I came to this conclusion, I found that Dr. Thomas had patforward a simi lar suggestion with regard to the peculiarItr which is employedon the Mathura Lion-capital (E, I. is, 137). There is however an importantdifference between this inscription and those on that capita], namely, that there an original gis hardened tofc,aa in bhakavatS fo'hagmto) and naharaasa (-mymkasa), while here an original &, when not initial and not compounded, IB (as will be explained, see below) softened tog.It seems probabletherefore thatgrin the first part here had the sound of , and that h on that capital had a sound like ~, It will be convenient to transliterate this diacritical r as an italic, 
Similar to the r stroke is astraight stroke to the right, attached to the lowest pointof the character for mi It obviously denotes somethingdifferent from plain mi, which occurs in Artmisiyasa, (1. 1), midra (1. 2) and Mityagasija (L3 C). All the instances in which it appears are singular locative cases, and as the locative singularin the Prakrits ends in mU or mm, we 
may justly take this character mii as meaning mhi It can hardlydenote mmi, because this means a doubled TO, and letters are never written double in thisscript. It will however be con venient to transliterate this stroke also as an italic r, 
It seems therefore from this examination that the straightr stroke was used as a diacritical sign to denote a modification of the main, consonant in certain cases, certainly withg and here and with 2c on the Lion-capital, in the wayof givingthat consonant a rougher,thicker or doubled sound. 
The language is a form of Prakrit and in discussingits character the phonetic changes may ba noticed first, and the inflectional forms afterwards, Vowels remain the same as iii Sanskrit except that an is reduced to 6, and ri is replaced by a, or i There is no clear instance of the elision of consonants (except a final t once), not even of the semi-vowela </and v which are BO liable to suffer in Prakrit, except yof the genitivetermination sometimes, SpeaHng generally the only changes that occur amongconsonants are, first, a uniform softeningof all single temies or hard consonants of the five classes to their corresponding media or soft conson ants;and secondly, the assimilation of the more difficult compoundconsonants. The changes may be conveniently set out in the form of rules. 
Bute 1 Sanskrit tenues or hard consonants, when not initial and not compounded, are changed to their corresponding mediae or soft consonants, This holds goodfor fc, t andj) throughout,1except t in verbal terminations. Thus drepresentsan original* Wiajmado -Ihagavata (1, 1), mada-pidara-mti-pitaraand bAradte6ats6ftrflfa5 (L 2). S represents an original y pwidlia'btti^parid'kapeti (1, 1) and wlapa-napagw (1,3 A). And represents w original k, and thus the common suffix h appearshere as q$or (with the diacritical t stroke discussed above) 'as jraso nfl%ra=ttii/i:ft and aawMa^rflMA^a^lta (1, 2), wd&tf0ra= twpob (1, 3 A), jaZopsas=jatej/tfea (1. 3 B), and samgUga^tmghih (L 4). Whether this corrective applies to the name Marepaand its variant Kar^Mis doubtful ; yetit doespro* bably because the stroke in them is that of the unreal r. One exceptionoccurs, rajaitraja (1, 2), in which the original i has been preserved, probably because it is a special royaltitle.

1 El. 5x, plate IV at p, 146, Hating regardto the forms used there, Dr. Thomas thinks that this letter At is i, but there appearto me to be grave objectionsthereto. First, as handwritings varied, each writing must prim arily be scrutinized byitself as urgedinp, 203, note 1 ; here the writingis miniate, neat and well-formed,BO ttat the presumptionIB that the differences between characters were made deliberately and have their special signify tnce. Secondly,t proper appearsIn the words pwi/atci, amtara, and antpy&ta (11.8 A and B), as wall aa in yaridhaleti (1. 1), rajatibaja (1. 2) and iafiatiga (1.3 B) ; and if this character if iareallyi also, tben t is made in two ays markedly different) and moreover without any reason, as we see especiallyin the compound words natigrd-midra-saihlilatigTanct, where there was no reason to write the dr in midra different from, the t in the two other words,if theyare all alike t, Thirdly,if this dr is t, all distinction between t, tr and dr would be obliterated) a conclusion that seems to me highly improbable, considering how important and significant these three letters t, d and r are in the different kinds of Prakrit, Fourthly, Sanskrit t medial and un compounded is certainly changedto d in this Prakrit as shown under Bnle 1, and the same change would be natural when t is compounded with r which ii only & liquid, so that we should by analogy expect the t in Sanskrit putra and mitra to appear hen as d, My readingsof the three characters aa t (as in the words cited above),if(asin amhatri, 1. 3 C) and dr (as in pficfo'fl,fflMffl and adra) giveeach character a consistent value throughout,a value' which accordsfollywith definite phonetic changes; whereat i! we read all these characters as t, we should have three different forms for t (with none apparentlyfor if or dr) and this Prakrit would become chaotic in its modifications. The confusion would be still farther increased, if the letter which I read as cl (see p, 204)be treated as a fourth form of t,

NOTES, 
Line 1. 
fttasya may be a clerical error for masa or masasya, unless it should be a genitive from the old Persian word mah, "month," Prakritized. A clerical error at the very certainly seems impiobable, Prof. Liiders has suggested that masasya passedinto *t#/i *.'/" and then into m&sya* but such a modification hardly agrees with the general characterof this Prakrit, which is close to Sanskrit as explained above, His view however lends to my suggestion that the Persian word may have been Prakritized as ma, the final 7i dropped as visarga is droppedin Prakrit, and the genitive masija formed from it. The month may have been designated by a regular term mah Artwnisiya, and this term may havo adopted here in its entirety, and then both words put into the genitive ;the termination and not sa, being added to ma, in order to distinguish the word from the common noun masa show that it is a genitive. The general practicein , this inscriptionis to inflect only the last of two OL- more words placedin apposition, but in this case both words are certainly iu tliu genitive, unless we suppose masya is a clerical error for masa, which is improbable. The general rule then may have been varied in this formal and precise statement of the date. 
Artawiisiya= the Greek month Artemisios Prakritized, the Greek t being transliterated ly the cerebral t. At the present time the English t is alwaysao transliterated. Stehi, and not stihi, appearsto be the actual reading.I cannot offer any explanation of this puzzling word, and can only throw out a suggestion that, as the Greek month was sometimes divided into two partscalled m&ii histamenos and men phtlvinontstehi might, through the old Persian root st8,>(f to stand," possibly and perhapsin abbreviation represent histamenos, If this bo possible, the date would be the 15th dayof the first half of ttiit month. 
Oadigvena. The difficult letter di in this word has been discussed above (p. 20 J-), Gadigva may= gadiku, (byrule 1), or yaddika (byrules 1 and 3), or galika (by rule 1). It undoubtedly refers to this vase. Gcidika, or better gaddika, is probably a dialectical form of Sanskrit gadduka, which means<fa kind of jar, especially a goldenvase"a terra that would have well saited this vase in its pristine brilliance, for when discovered portions of it were so bright as to resemble gold (see p. 203), 
Pudra musb, it seems to me, agree with Kamagulya nndgovern Vagra-Maregrasya, though this constiuction varied from the ordinary arrangement by which it should follow the word it governs.The ordinary construction, by which yudra would govern Kawagulya, eeems to xno to lead to serious difficulties. -The renderingI have adopted, though not common, is not irregular and makes the whole sentence plain,2 
Iya~Khav<idamh$ is obviously the locative case of the placeto which the following vv Ord ftfidalayigra refers, and the place therefore is denoted by the expression lya-Khavada or lya-Khavata, (by rule 1), There can be no doubt that we have here the ancient

of the present name of tlio place, Khawat, where this vase was found. If this expression be taken as one word, it would be lyaWahavata (byrule 4), and this is suggestiveof the Greek laltkhos,c< Bacchus or Dionysos," whose legend was localised in this regionas is well known. This view was temptingbut appears untenable, because it is highly improbable (as 
a distinguished Greek scholar has informed me)that the oriental Greeks of this region would have had the name lakklios in public vog'iio, as it only had a real base in Attica and was a library figment outside. Moreover, no Greek derivation cu,n apparentlybe suggested except 
perhnpa Iu,kkho 4- hod'os, which is unsuitable. Again lyaltklMvatttis hardly an Indian word. Tbe only alternative is to divide it into iyu, Khavata, and thin division gives forthwith the modern name Khawat, while iy a appearsto be a pronoun meaning "this," or "here." The pronoun id am developed, or had as an equivalent,a base M iu Prakrit (apart from the feminine tiomin. iyaiii), for the masculiae or neutor locative iaimii id found1 and the base ia itself did exist.3 This ia might well be written iya here, for this inscription has literary qualities,ancl tlio neighbouring old Persian word iyam, which is its exact equivalent and is both masculine, and feminine, might naturallyinfluence the spelling. Iija Khavata-mld would then mean"in this very Khavata," where the monastery was situated. Or iij a might equallywell be taken aB=Skt. iha,"here."3 Either way the meaning is the same. Kbavata, or Khavata or Khavata. as it might be read, does not seem to have any meaning,if considered to be of Indian derivation avata was a termination used iu the names of places,aft Vdi'aHftPdta^ 
^srit&layika, (byrule 1), which is formed from Imtalaya,as liridayika from from tatyti, etc. The whole is a more precise adjective than Imtalaya, both meaning ''having frxcd one's residence.'3It suggeststhat Kaimigulytidid not belongto this place originally, but had come to reside hore. 
Tumbimlii. The first akshara is clearlytn or thu, and thuya,thuba, or thuva suggests itself, bat is inadmissible because the second aksliara is nut plain p,I or v. No other word beginning with thn seems possible. The letter must be read then as lit,. The second aksliara IB a new character. At first sightit seems to be based on the character for st; see the previous word sttlii and the forms of sli and stu in Biililer's Table I (n. 3i>, v, vi and vii) and Dr. Thomas' Table IV (E.

combination with b, and hardly probableia combination with v,for vv would be a doubled v and letters are not written double here. Only m therefore seems possible, and the character is presumably mbi (or mvi).In supportof this it may be observed, that m could hardlybe expressed by the nsual curve for m (see p. 205) added to tutand could therefore be only 
indicated by some addition to the letter 6 (or v) to form the compound ml (or mv"). The word therefore ia tunibimhi (or tumvimhi), the locative case of tuvibi (or tumvi). No Indian word seems possible, and the onlyinference that arises ia that lunibi (or tumvi) is a foreign word adopted and Prakritized. Since the cerebral t is used to denote the Greek t, aa in Arfamisiya, tumbi suggeststbo Greek word kumbion, the diminutive of tumbost"a sepulchral chamber or vault." Tunibion would become tumbiyain Prakrit and might be shortened to tumbi in ordinary parlance. Greek influence was strongin this region, and tumbion would be an appropriate word to denote the substantially constructed cavityor cupolain the tumulue in which the vase was found (see p, 201). This renderingis surprising, yet none other seems to me possible from the scrutiny, 
Bhagvavada Sakya-munehas been discussed above (p. 209). 
Paridhabeti=paridliapeti, (byrule l)= Skt. paridhapayati,causal of pari-dtia, and means "encloses." The usual term to express the installation of a relic-shrine is patitthaveti, and this suggests itself as the word intended here. Th and dh are similar and the third akshara might be read either way, but patithabeti, (as patitthabeti might appear here by rule 4) does 
not appear to be intended for three reasons based upon the writing,the grammar and the sense. First, the second akshara ia certainly not t but r, for it agrees exactly with the two r's which immediately precede In the word sanra ; secondly,if it were intended, it would presumably appear as padithabeti or perhaps paditlialeti (byrules 1 and 4) and di or di could hardly lead to an erroneous n ; and thirdly,this word must be taken with vmena gadigveiw>, in wlich the relic was enclosed, and paridhabetisuits the context better than patitthabett.

Kutiala-mulena. This expressionoccurs on the Maaikyala stone,1 and is also a technical Buddhist terra. As a technical term' The three Kusalamulaf),"roots of goodness or ground wprk of merit" are alobho t adoso, amoko, freedom from covetousriess, from anger, and from ignorance':2 but this i a terpretationis unsuitable here, and the expression here presumably means something different, as Prof. Liiders also apparently holds when dealing with the Manikyala stone.3 It may mean"well-conceived foundation,'3"virtuous endowment/' if Jcufala be taken as an adjective j and"root of well-being," "source of meritorious action,"if Jcutiala be taken aa a noun. 4 Here from its general adaptabilityit may imply all these meanings with reference to the relic. 
Agra bliaga. Agra, means "foremost, pre-eminent," and Wi&gn "portion, lot, destiny." The word might he read Ihagga (byrule 3), which would=Skt. blagya,"fortune, lot, destiny.11 The meaning is the same either way. M. Senarthas pointed out that agrabhaga here corresponds io agrebhava, in the inscriptionof Toramana Shaha of Kura (B. I., i, 240), which has agrebh&va p-raty&mdatayastu.5Agrebhava,denotes a state or condition, and ograbhaga here mufit presumably imply the same,"a pre-emiueat lot," and not"a first share."

to what Ihdga as a"share'* could refer,1 whereas a condition ia intelligible and natural. He first translated agrabJiaga as"prosperity," but afterwards agreed with Biililer to seek in it a direct allusion to the acquisitionof bodhL2 I would rather suggest that, since the expression appears to denote a condition,it refers to Buddhahood. With the -word pratyathsd added (see note to padiyamsam, tn/ra), "a share of Buddhahood" seems to be as appropriataas "a share of bodhi." The expression can hardlyrefer to any worldly blossing, because in that case is it not rather witless to utter such a wish on behalf of Hu.vish.ka, who enjoyed already the highest position on earth ? 
Bhavatu is used here with the dative, as acjra lliagae and piiya?. Since the dative implies 'purpose, intention, aim/ bhavatu with the dative meana"mny it be for the purpose of,""may it be with an aim towards,"that is,"may it tend towards,""may it operate towards." 
Mada-pidaramata-pitara (byrule 1). This must be the genitiveof m^tt-pittitiv.ited as a singular noun ;3 and it is so treated in the Taxila plate, -where the accus, mata-pitm-am occurs (E. I, iv5 55). The genitive must be employedhere after puyaeas in all the other similar sentences. This appears to be a new form of Prakrit genitive, and the nearest approachto it is piaraha which is a genitiveof pita.41 Its real formation appearsto be Ibis pit ara^pitaral), (the visarga disappearing in Prakrit) which would be correctly formed as a genitive from yritar (which is the essential base of pitri)* just like girafy from gir and cliarah from nJuir in Sanskrit.6 The declension of pitri in Sanskrit shows similar forma from the base pitar, as yritaram, pitarau, pitarali and pitari. 
Puyae. Puja means more than"honour"and implies snme degreeof veneration or rever ence ;hence puyae Ihavatu means"may it tend to the veneration." 
Bhradaba aa the word clearlyis and not lliradara. SasUuna Mwegrasya,is in apposition to this word and not to me, for the declarant is Kamagulyaaud me refers to him and the meaning is that Hashtnna Marega is the bhradaba in relation to me, that is, Kamagulya. Me is inserted parenthetically,like cha in mahiffi Vagra Maregrasya (1. 2) and in malitia Rohana 
(I, 3 B). Bhradata cannot well be treated as a mistake for bhradara on the analogyof the preceding mfitS-pitara and so taken as the genitiveof WrSdS, because (1)it is contraryto the general practice to inflect two words in appositionas would happenif we read bliradara HasUma-MaregTasya ;and (2)it is unnecessaryto suspect anymistake. Indeed one should hesitate to suppose there is an error in spelling, unless the mistake is patent (as in rajMaja, 
1 a) or the word actually written appears impossible (as in aviya,1. 3 A, and asamtrana, 1. 4) ; and one should presume that what haa been written is what was intended,if it has an intelligible

the first and diverges from rf or y, in that its left limb is prolonged unusually downward in pand ph.

In my article on the Pardi platesof the TraikQtaka king Dahrasena3 it was stated *hat the'lafce lamented Mr. A, M. T. Jackson, I.O.S.,. had in his hands an unpublished copper-plate grant of Dahrasena's eon and successor Vyaghrasena.4 At my request Rai Bahadur Venkayya obtained the original plateson, loan throughthe Government of Bombay, who were good enough to permit them to be sent to me for inspection. 
Aa stated by Mr. Jackson, the copper-plates come from Surat, They are two in number, aoh measuring between 9j and 9^inches in breadth, and about 3|inches in height, and bear writing only on their inner' sides. Theyare comparativelythin and have no raised lims, but the writing on them is in a state of fairly good preservation. A number of letters are filled with verdigris and therefore haye not oome out on the impressions, though/their outlines ave quite visible on the original plates. As in the case of the Pardi plates, there are two ring-holes at the bottom of the inscribed side of the first plate, and two correspondingones at the topof the second plate. A long copperwire is passed thronghthe two holes on the right, and its ends are twistod round, but not soldered. A second copperwire mayhave held the plates together on the left, but is now missing. The total weightof the plates and wire ia-SO-tolaa. The alphabet is of an early southern type. The Jihvamullyaoccurs once (1. 1) and the Upadhmaniya five times (11. 4, 5, 6 (twice), and 14), In three instances (w3,1. 9, and to, 11, 13 and 18) the secondary form of a ia expressed bya hook at the bottom of the preceding consonant. The date at the ead of the inscription contains the abbreviation sam (for carfroaf) and the numerical symbols ], 5, 10) 40, and 200. 
The language is Sanskrit prose;; but two Yeraea of Vyasaare quotednear the end. The rules of grammar and of 'swdU are carefully observed ; only11. 10- 14 contain * few blunders, and 1. 8 two clerical mistakes. Anusvara ia replaced byri in vanfa (1, 5) and va% (1. 12).

The date of the grant was the 15th tithi of the bright fortnight of Karttika in tixo year 241 of an unspecified era (1. 18). As we know from coins that Vyaghrasena was the son of Dahrasena,3 whose Pardi plates are dated in [Kalachuri-jSamvat 207, the date of the now inscription must be also referred to the Kalachuri era of A.D. 249, and the specified montli places the record in A.D. 490 or 491. 
The following short pedigree comprisesall that we know from coins and inscription a pegardiug the Traikiitaka kings of Aparanta, residing at Aniruddhapura:

No. 22. FIFE BANA INSCRIPTIONS FROM GUDIMALLAM.1 
Br V. VENRAYTA, M.A., EAI BAHADDS. 
G-udimallam is a villagein the KalahastiZamlndari of the modern Chittoor District, about 8 miles from Bgniguata Junction, and 13 miles south-west of Kalahasti town. On a hurried visit to the village which I paidin August 1903, I found important inscriptions; and subse^^tly a member of the Madras epigraphical establishment was deputed to examine the place more leisurely. In all, 26 inscriptions were copiedin the Parasuramesvara templeat the village.2 They belong to the Pallava king Naadippottaraiyar (No. 229 of 1903) ; the Ganga-Pallava kings Vijaya-Dantivikramavarman (No. 226 of 1903) and Nrigatunga (No. 228 of 1908) ; the Bana.princ0.Vijayad.itya (Nos. 223 and 224 of 1903) ; the Chola kings. Farantaka L (No; 225 of 1903), Rajakesarivarman (No. 222 of 1903), Vikrama-Chola (Nos. 212 and 21 3 of 1903) and Bffijaraja in. iNos. 204-11, 2U, 216-21 and 227 of 1903). The villageis called Tiruviniemm bedu in Silai-nadu, a sub-division of Vengada-tedttam in Perumbanappadi, a district of Jayangonda-Chola-mandalam. In the earlier records (Nos. 226, 223, 22fi, 229 of 1903) tie forms Tiruvippirambedu and Tiruvirpirambedu (Nos. 228 and 224 of 1903) arid Tiruviy periimbedu (No. 222 of 1903) occur. In three of them, the villageis mentioned without the district .to whioli it belonged (Hos. 223, '226 and 229 of 1*903). In four others Silai-nadu and Yengadla-k(5ttam are added. If w& acceptthe form which occurs in the earliest inscription, OT'. Ttrwippiramb8$ttt the name may b& analysed into Tiruvippiran and pedu, Vippira-fiis apparently a tadbhava of the Sanskrit vipra,ca brahmana.'Consequently,the name "wouldsignify 'the sacred toll n go of the brahmana.'

below), TaraguramiSYaratta-PerumanadigAl (No. 222 of 1903) and Parasirainisvaraniudaijar (No, 221 of 1903). Thus the templeis invariablycalled ParaSuramisrara from the tune of the ear liest inscriptions down to the present day. None of the epigraphs, however, furnishes anyclue aa to -the circumstances which, led to the choice of this name. 
The subjoined inscriptions A. to E.1 are the earliest records of the temple and are selected for publication as they throw some light on the historyof a feudatory family, that of the Banaa, the members of which appearto have playedan important partin Southern India in ancient times : a general note on the history of this familyis given on pp. 229 to 240, below. Most of the stones on which these inacriptions are engraved*ere fonnd lyingin the court-yardof the temple. The fact that three of them register giftsto the Parasuramisvara temple may he taken to show that the stones belonged originally to it; perhaps they hocame detached from the temple when it was built (or rebuilt) duringthe reignof the Chola king Vikrama-Chola,2 
The palaeography of these records does not call for any special remarks. Attention m&y, however, be drawn to the fact that two dots placed one above the other are used as a wgn of punctuation in line 10 of A.3 The initial vowel t is written in line 31 of B. and line 2o of D. exactly ae in the Grantha portionof the Kasakudi plates of the Palkva king Nandivarman Pallavamalla, while the more common form of the letter occurs in line 52 of the> former record.

Note on the history of the Sana princes. 
Of the foregoing records, the inscription A, is dated duringthe reignof the Pallava king Nandippottaraiyari whose feudatory was the Bana chief Vikramaditya-Mavali-Vanarayar. B. belongs to the time of the Ganga-Pallava king Bantivikramavarman, who had Vijayaditya-Mahavali-Vanaraya for his feudatory, and C. to that of Nripatunga, who 
probably belonged to the same family, though the characteristic portionsof the names of the kings of that line are here missing. "The grantrecorded in the latter was made while Vanavidyadhara-Mahabali-Vanaraya was governingthe Vadugavali-merku (province), 
D. and B. are dated in the Saka era3 and belongto the time of the Bana chief Vijayaditya Mabali-Vanaraya. The tract of countryin which Kalahasti and Grudimallam are situated belonged to the Pallavas,3 and it is therefore no matter for surprise that an inscriptionof that dynasty and two of the Ganga- Pallavas have been found there. 
The identity of Nandippflttaraiyarof the Gudimallam inscription A. with Nandivarman PallaTamalla of the Kasakudi plates remains doubtful, though not unlikely. As regardsDanti vikramavarman, another inscriptionof his reign dated two yearslater than his Gudimallam record has been found at Tirnchchanilr near Tirupati ;* and we may,for the present, identify him with the first Ganga-Pallava king Dantivarman of the Bahur plates, and Nripatiinga with his grandson Npipatunga-Vikramavarman. Earlier inscriptions of the former, ranging from the 10th to the 21st year, have been so far found in the vicinityof Conjeeveram5 and may be taken to show that his territory was limited. Why the two later inscriptionsare found in a different part of the conntry is a point on which no information is at present forthcoming. His son Nandivikra mavarman, too, seems to have been ruling a limited country,to judge from his inscriptions found 
1 Mr. Gtopinatha Rao identifies tfandippottaraiyar with K6-V5jay a-Naudivikramavarman and accordingly concludes that B. is older than A. It will be seen that the photo -lithographsof these two records issued with this paper do not bear out this conclusion. Apart from hia wholesale identification of all kingsin whose names the word nandi is found as well as of those with danti as part of their names, loth of which I consider untenable, even Mr. Gopinatha Eao cannot deny that there were at least two kings with the name Nandivarman, viz, Nandi vannan Pallavamalla and Ko-Vijaya-Nandivikraraavarmanor -Kandivarman. Surelyit cannot becontended^that JTandivarman Pallavamalla has left no stone inscriptions. And as he is called Nandipotarajain the Kasakndi plates, Nandippottaraiyar of A. may for the present he identified with him, This initial mistake of Mr. Gopioatha Rao has led him to other errors in the chronologyof the Eanas. 
2 The fact that the Saka era is used in them Is probably due to the fact that the Qanga-Pallavas had completely collapsed and the overlordsbip of the Cholau had not yet been recognisedin that part of the country. The Banas who had been feudatories of the Ganga-Pallavas had probably not yet made uptheir minds to transfer their allegiance to the Cholas, Similarly, in a Tiravallam inwription, we find the Saka date 810 given and no overlord of the Bana chief is mentioned (Sovth-Ind.Insert. Vol. III. p, 95), Other Tamil epigraph* which are dated in the 
aka era are Nos. 338 and 356 of 1902 (Sf.Ind, Vol. VII. pp. 136 and 137)and No. 426 of 1903 (Annual Btport cm Epigraphy for 1903-04, paragraph 20). One of the injotiptiOQS of the Chola king VirarajendraI. is dated in the 
Sftka year coupled with the cyclic year (No. 273 of 1904). A record of Parantaka I. found at Qramam m the South Arcot District is dated in the Kaliyugaera and gives the number of days that had actually elapsed on a certain day during the reign of the Ch5la king (Up.2nd. Vol. VIII. p. 261). Another of Parakesarivarman Utfcma Cfcoja found at Tirnvidaimarudur in the Tanjore District is also dated in tne Kaliyugft era (Madrtu rt for 1907-08, paragraph 53).

kiag (Banarasa). At Bangavadiin the same district is a Ban a epigraph, which refers to the Capture by the Permanadigal (i.e. the "Western Ganga king),of Mabavajara-nad which belonged to the Sana chief (Mb. 228).1 That the Gangas arid the Bfiuas were also occasionally on friendly terms is shown by the marriageof the Ganga princess K-undavvaiyar, daughter of Erithivipati L, with the Baua king Baaavidyadhara.3 
The kings mentioned in the stone inscriptions bear several names, and, consequently, it is often very difficult fco identify them with those in the foregoing genealogical table. Though we have reason to suppose thah the Banas were feudatories of the Pallavas, the references to them. in Pallava inscriptions are very few. In A, above, Vikramaditya-Mavali-Vanaraya, governing the VadugavaH-moj;ku, figures as a feudatoryof the Pallava king Nandippottaraiyar, who may be identical with ISandivarman Pallavamalla, the last powerful kingof the Pallavas. If this be the case, the Baua king Vikraiuadifcya. under reference, cannot be identified with "Vikvaiuaditya I. of the foregoingtable. One of the earlier kiugs must have borne the surname Vikramaditya ; perhaps Banavidyadhara,or his predecessor. 
After the downfall of the Pallavas of Conjeeveram,their empire seems to have been split up, and wti find the Banas playinga very important partin all the frontier wars. The Ganga PallaVa king Narasimlia-Vikraniavarman, whose initial date has been placed by Dr. Fleet between A.D. 700-70, had a feudatory named Skanda-Banadhiraja.8 At Bangavadi in the MulhiigaL taluka of the Kolar District is an inscription recording the death of a servant of this king ou the occasion of a cattle-raid.'* Vijaya-Skandasishya-Vikramavarman of the Rayakota plates, who may have been a successor of Narasirhka-Vikramavarman, also had a Barm feudatoryE Danti-Vikramavarman (B. above) had Vijayaditya-Mahavali-Vanaraya for his feudatory This Vijayaditya must be earlier than Vrj ayaditya II., in the foregoing table. Dnntivikrama vavman'a son and successor Waudiviltramavarmaa had Vikramaditya-Mavali-Vanaraya for his feudatory in the 17th yearof his reign and an unnamed Mavali-Varuiraya in tha 62nd yearof hia reign.7 The former has perhaps to be identified with Vikraaifulitra J as we have some reason to supposethat Nandivikrama married a daughter of the Eashtrakuta king taoghavarsha Iv (SH-lo to 877-78). 3 This Vikramaditya is probably identical with Baoavidyadhara who married a daughter of the Western Ganga 'Prithivipati I., another coatemporary of the Rashtrakflta king Amoghavarsha Lg Tho Biina contemporary of Nandi vikrama's son Nripatuuga was "VSnaTidyadhara-Mababali-Vanai'aya according1 to 0, above As Professor Hultzsoh has tentativelyidentified the Pirudi-Gangaraiyar, mentioned in the Ainbur inscriptions as a feudatoryof Nripatunga, with the Ganga PrithivipatiI.;io it may be supposed, at least for the present, that this Yauavidyadhara is identical with the son-in-law of the Ganga king PiithivlpatiI,

The inscriptions discovered in the Pungaaur Zammdfm of the North Arcot District mention Hahavali-Banaraaa-Vikramaditya-Bauakandarpa-Jayamera, Mahavali-Vanarasa-Banavidya dbara and MahriYali-Vanarasa-Vijayaditya-Virachulamaui-Prabliuraeni, One of the records of the first of theso kings refers to a battle foughtat Soreinati, where tbe Bfi-na opposed, on behalf of the Permanadi (i.e. the Western Gaaga ldog?) ?the Ifolamba (king ?) and Kachamalla and Mayindadi.* A vzragalat Madanapalle in tbe Ouddapah District refers to a battle at the same place, which probably took place duringthe reignof the Vaiduuiba king G-anda-Trinetra.* A stone at Bangavadi in the Kolar District refers to an encounter between the same parties.1' Jf t!ie Rifichanialla in these vwagals was a Ganga,he may be identified with the Satyavakya 
Kongunivarma-Permanadi Eajamalla, who^e fiual date is about A.D. 870-71,7 If fchia identification be correct, the date of the Mahiivali-Banarasa of the Puaganur inscription* may bo iakon roughly as the middle of the Oth century A,D, 
According to the G-ulganpode epigraphs,8Vikraraadifeyo, who has boon identified byDr. Fleet and Professor- Hnltzsch with VikranuulityaI, (No, C in the foregoing genealogical table) was also called JayaraGru.9 Ib may, therefore, bs couclude.l that the above muutioned Mahavali Banavasa-Vikramaditya-Banakandarpa-tTayamei-nis identical with Vikramaditya (No. G in the preceding table of synchronous kings). Perhapsthe Mahavali-Yanarasa-Bagavidyadhara mentioned in another Pnngannr inscriptionis also identical with VikraraadityaI. In the two Giilgfmpode inscriptions, reference is made to a commander named Prablmmeru, who might have been a general called after the father of VikramadityaI. It is, however, not unlikely that VijayfuHtya-yiraclmliimaai-Prabhumer-a mentioned above is identical with Vijayaditya II., iu which case the Prabhumeru of tbe Gdlganpodarecords might be tbe son of Vikramaditya I, This identification rec&ivea some sapport from the fact that, in ona of the Gulganpode tablets, it is said that, by order of Prabhamem, a hero fought againstthe EMuvatti force, while in the Pun-anur record of Vijayadityareference is made to a raid on Koyatur, i.e. Laddigam in the Punganar Zamlndari, by Kaduvatti-Mnttarasa.10 
As Vikramaditya II, was a friend of Krishnarnja, who has been identified with the Raahtrakuta Krishna II, (A,D. 888 and 911-12), it may be^coQcIudedthat the VijaySditya,

son of BSnavidyadhara, mentioned ia D. and E. above, must be identical with Vijayaditya II. This identification, if conBrmed byfuture researches, would show that Vikramaditya I. also bore the surname Banavidyadbaraa fact already surmised by Dr, Fleet from the Gulganpode records. 
The fact that the two Grudimallam inscriptionsof Vijayaditya are dated in the Saka era aad that they mention no overlord is significant: the dates are Saka-Samvat 820 and 8*27 corresponding to A.D. 897-98 and 904-5. We have another date for the same king in an inscrip tion at ManigSLtt.a-Gollai-ah.alH-- 1 here the Bana prince Bejeyitta-Banarasa is eaid to bo rulingin Saka-Samvat 831, correspondingto A.D, 09-10. If this be the case, the Bana king Vikram Sditya II. must have assumed the leadershipof the Banas towards the close of the leign of the RashtrakQta king Krishna II. The reasons which mast have led to Vikramaditya5a courting the friendship of the Rashtrakutas may now be examined. 
We have abeady seen that the Gangas and Banas were often fighting with one another. At Kendatti-Madivala in the Rolar District is a stcme inscriptionof Nitimarga Kongunivarman which llr. .Rica assigns to about A.D. 890.3 The Ganga king's feudatory, Wolambadhiraja of the Pallava family, is here said to have ordered a generalof his to fight against the Bana king (Bana rasa). Another unnamed Bana kingis said in a vtragalat Bangavadi in the same district to have opposed a confederacyof the JSTo^amba king, Rachamalla, Mayindadi and Dadiga.8 At Dharmapuri in the Salem District is a pillar (DOW removed to the Madras Alnseum) which records a gift by the Pallava king Hahendradhiraja-Nolamtoa. The latter claimed to have- **destroyed the Mahabali (i.e, Bana) family." The inscriptionis dated in A.D, 892-93. Mahendradhiraja-NolambaTV as the son of Nolatnbadhiraja by Jayabbe, the daughter of the Ganga king Eajamalla.4 As the latter was the grandfatherof the Nolamba king Mahendra dhiraja, \vhose date ia A.D. 892, we may identify the Ganga king RajarmJla with the Satya yakya-Kongunivarma-Permanadi Eajamalla for whom Dr. Fleet gives the date A.D. 840 to 870-71. 5 The Nitiraarga-Kongiinivarraanof the Madivala inscription, whose contemporary and feudatory was the Nolamba king Nolanabadhiraja, has to be identified with Rajamalla's father Ranavikrama, for whom Dr. Fleet gives the approximate(3 ates A.D. 810 to 840. It is just pos sible that N ol.amloadhiraja w ae contemporaneous\vith bothBajamalla and his father Ragavikrama, and fou ght againpt the Banas. We have alreadyseen that the noi them portion of the North. Arcot District was included in the Bana dominions. At Vallimalai, which would be almost ia the centre of the Bana territory, we have an inscription of the Ganga king Rajamalla. Of him it is said thafc, having seen the Valliranlai Lill, he took possession of it and caused a Jaina lasti to he made on it.6 Though it is not stated from whom the Ganga Icing took possession of the hill, we may suppose that it was wrested from the Banas. An image of a pupil 
of the Bana prince's spiritual preceptoris cut in relief on the hill not far from the Gang-a inscription. This unfortunatelyis the only vesiigeof Baiia rule which is now traceable on the hill. But Melpadi, which is onlya mile from the hill, is said to have belonged to Perumbanap* padi in the Ohola inscriptions found in two Siva temples at the village.7 It may, therefore be supposed that the Gnngas and Nojtambas had joined together8 to fight against the Banas.9 The capture of Vallimaki bythe Ganga king Uajamalla was effected apparentlyin the campaign ~~~

against the Banaa,1 The claim of the Nolamba king Mahendradhiraja, grandson of the Gaiiga king Rajamalla, to have destroyed the Mahabali family was evidently not an empty boast Consequently, the Barms must have been driven to a corner about the time of which we are now 
speaking. 
Again, in the Tamil country, the Qanga-Pallavas who had bee a overlords of theBanas were evidently tottering at the time. Prior to A.D. 897-98, the date of the earlier Gudimallam 'inscrip tion (D,), the decisive battle of Tiruppupambiyam mast have been fought between the Ganga Pallava Aparajita and the Pandya king Varaguna. The Cholas must also have taken the place of the Ganga-Pallavas in the tract of country of which we are at present speaking. It was evidently a time when the Ganga-Pallavas had disappeared from the scene and their place had not been actually taken by the Chslas. Perhaps this was why the two last of the sub joined inscriptions do not mention any overlord, but are dated in the Saka era. This state of tilings probably continued 'for aome time. For, in Saka-Sarhvat 831, correspondingto A.D. 90S-9,2 the same Baua prince Vijayaditya II. was ruling, but there is no mention of any over lord in the inscription. Perhaps his son Vibramaditya II. of the Udayendiram plates repre sents himself as an independent kbg for this reason. The political condition of Southern India at the time rendered it necessaryfor Vikramaditya II. to make friends with some powerful king. As the Bana prince Vijayaditya seems to have ruled until at least A.D. 909, his successor Vikramaditya II, must have assumed the leadershipof the Banaa subsequent to that date. la this case, he must have become the friend of Krishna II. towards the close of the latter's reign. 
Though the Nolamba king Mahendriidhiraja claims to have "destroyed"the Banas, they continued much longer. They appear to have lost their power and influence with the decline of the Ganga-Pallavas. The synchronisms of the Ganga, Baua and,Nolaraba dynastiesare shown on the accompanying table3: -

The subsequent historyo thia feudatory familyis not altogether devoid of interest. How long Vikramaditya II. continued to rale, we have at present no means of ascertaining. Either he or Ms successor must have been conquered bythe Chola king Parantakal. in or before A.D. 921- 22. Tie latter claims to have uprooted byforce two lords of the Bana kings,1 We are not, 
however, told whether he uprooted two Bana kings in succession or simultaneously. Anyhow, he made over the Bana kingdom to his Granga- feudatory Prithivipati II. Hastimalla in or before A,P. 915-1G3 and called him Sembiyan Mavalivanarayan, i.e."the Mahavalivaimrajn, 
(who was a feudatory) of the Chola king."3 At Yedarur in the Koliir District of the Mysore State 10 a stone inscription dated in Saka-Saihvat 883 correspondingto A.D. 9G1 which men tions a Batia chief named Sambayya as a feudatory of Iriva-!Nolamba.4 Againat Sannamuru in the Podili division of the Mlore District is another atone inscription of the Bana family.I have read the date tentatively as Saka-Samvat 890 (correspondingto A.D. 90S) and the name of the Ba.ua chief as Aggaparaju.5 The latter does not mention any overlord and this may be taken to show that lio was semi-independent. The date falls into the reignof the Eastern Chalukya king Amma II.6 and is a few years priorto the interregnumin the Verigf country.7 What part, if any, this Bana king playedin the interregnum we have at present no means of ascertaining, "We shall not be far wrong if we supposethat the Churaballiraju, who figuresin a stone inscription at Konidena (near Narsaraopetin the Guntur District)8 was a descendant of Aggaparajn. The inscriptionof Chfiraballirajuis dated in Snka-Samvat 1073, correspond ing to A.D, 1150-51, which falls into the reignof the Cbalukya king Bajaraja XL" 
In the Tamil districts of the Madras Presidency, the historyof the Bauas does not come to an. end with their conquest by Parautaka and the transfer of their dominions to their rivals, the Gangas. It has been surmised that the Banas ^erc originallysettled in tho Telugu country and that at a later stage in their history they moved into the northern partof the modern Noith Arcot District but retained the original designationof theirterritory. After Porumbunappadi wa transfen-el to the Sao gas, or perhapsat an earlier period in their history,10 the Banas seem to have moved farther south, crossed the river Pillar which seems to have been originally the southern boundary of their territory, and settled on the banks of the river Southern Fennar, calling tho new province Vanakoppadi or Vanagappadi,11 In A,D. 948-9, the Rashtrakuta king

village in Magadai-mandalam.1 Three other records from the same Tillage3 show that the district of Magadai should have been close to the village,if it was not actually included in it. It would not be an altogether wild conjectureto supposethat Mahara, Makara and Magara of the Eoysala inscriptions, is identical with the Magadai-mandalam ruled over bythe Viinakovaraiyar 
Ponparappinan. mentioned in the foregoing paragraph.3 If this identification be true,it would indicate the movement of the Banas farther south as far as the Pudnkk&ttai State. The chief of this province who was evidently a feudatoryof the rebel Penmjifiga had to be overcome before the latter could be attacked by the Hoysala generals commissioned to liberate the Cholft king Rajaraja III. from captivity.4 
We have traced the movement of the Banas as far south as the Pudukkofctai State. In still later times they figureas feudatories and officers of the Pandyas in the 13thcentury A.D.5 Mr. Sewell mentions two chiefs, one named Sundara T61 Mahavilivanadirayar and tho other Muttarasa Tirumalai Mahavilivanadirayar as rulers of Madura in the period A.D. 1451 
1499, 6 We have a few inscriptionsof the IGth century which show that the Bauas continued to wield some power and influence. These have been found at KiUaiyarksyil, Tiruppnllani and Devipattanam in the Madura district. The earliest of the chiefs mentioned in them is Mahabali Vanadharaya-Nayaka.7 Then came Sundarattol-IIdaiyar Mavali-Vanadarayar8or Sundarattoludaiya Mahabali-Vanadarayar.9 He was apparentlyalso known as Mavali Vanadarayar without anyadditional designation.10 In two of them he bears the epithet irandaTtalatn edutta 'who revived the past/ (i.e. re-established the Piiiidya kingdom). This may be taken to show that he took some parbin the attempt made by the contemporanecms Pandya princes Srivallabha and Kulasekhara to set up a show of Piindja sovereignty.11 
Thus the history of the Barias furnishes another instance of the moveruent of a tribe from one part of Southern India to another. This aspectof Indian history has already beeu explained in my article on the Pallavas publishedin the Director- General's Annual for 1906-7.

"In the [238th year (ofthe reign}of the glorious king Rajaraja-Kajakesarivarman,-- on the day of PunarvaBia, which correspondedto a Wednesday and to the [fourteenth3 [tUM] of the second fortnight of the month of Karkataka of this year." 
The date in this case is, like most others of this early period, worded in a manner a little different from the stereotyped form of later yearsin Soath India; so much. so that while Mr. Krishna Sastri has stated it as referringto the 14th, or possibly _16th,solar dayin Karkataka,I find that it tallies with the 14th UtU of the second fortnightof Ashadha bnt with the 19th solar day of Karkataka, and, since the word for<< 14fch ", j?ocK[|fi]. . . , occurs in the original between 
(tpara-palcfhctitu and Bw[da]fa-MJawat,I presumethat it is possible that the number"1Vrefers rather to the titlri than to the solar day.4 
In the 26th year of KajarajaI Kajakesarivarman,the 14th titU of the second fortnightof Ashadlha was current at mean sunrise on Thursday, July I3th A.D. 1010, which was the 19th solar day of Karka. Now the 14th titU of Ashadha is devoted to one of the Sivaratri festivals, and accordingly this titfct is liable to 1* joined with the Wednesdayrather than with the Thursday, the midnight between the two hayingbeen included in it (Kielhorn,Ind. Ant. 1897, pp. 177, 181). This 14th krishna titU began13h. 15m. before mean sunrise on the Thursday and included the midnightin question; while the nakskatra Punarvasu began, accordingto the equal-space system, 18h. 6m. before that mean sunrise, and considerablyearlier than that by the systems of Garga and the Brahma-siddhanta, beingcurrent both at midnighton Wednesday and at mean sunrise on Thursday.I think therefore that the day correspondingto the given day was Wednesday, July 12th A.D. 1010. If this is correct the accession of this sovereign must have taken place between June 25th and July12fch A.D. 985.

Thus the 49fch year of Kul5ttunga-ChOiaI began on, or later than, 27th March A.D. 1118 and the reign must have begun on, or later than that date in A.D. 1070;so that for this king's accession -we now have the period March 27th to October 8th A.D. 1070.

To paraphrase the opening passageof Professor Kielhorn's remarks on his ChSla date K"o. 40 (Vol. YIj p. 279), -"a date in the month of Dhanus of the 47th yearof the king's rei^n will be expected to fall near the end of A,D. 1 116." Now, as detailed, the givendate is incorrect for the 47th regnal year. But it is perfectly correct for the 48th year, mz^ towards the end of A.B. 1117. Now Mr. Krishna Sastri informs me that the figures 47 are perfectly clear in the original and cannot be read 48. We must therefore assume that the composerof the record made a mistake. 
The given date, exceptfor that mistake, corresponds with Monday, November 26th A.Da 1117, which, was the 2nd solar dayof Dhanus, and on which dayat mean sunrise the first titlii of the first fortnight of Pausha was current. By the equal- space'" system the nakshatra current at that mean sunrise was Mula, bat bythe systemof Garga and bythe Brahma-siddhanta the current nakshatra was Puiva-Ashadha, I conclude that the date is genuine, but that the composer erroneously stated the 47tb instead of the 48th regnal year.

TKia date is unsatisfactory. Given that the accession dayof this sovereign was, as settled by Professor Kielhorn (Ep. Ind., Vol. VII, p. 5), the 29th of June A.D. 1118, the date should correspond to a day in A.D, 1122 or 1123. In A.D. 1122 the 10th dayof Mithuna was Sunday, June -^frh, and on that day the 13th tifki of the second fortnightof Jyeshtha and the nahhatra RoLi^I "were current at mean sunrise. The week-day stated ia the inscription ia, hoover, Thursday. ConsequentlyI hesitate to acceptit. Moreover,that June 4th would be in the king's 4rfc}i not 5th. year, 
"For A.D. 1123 both week-day and naksliatra would differ from those stated in the original j the TVeek-day of June 23rd, which was the day on which the 13th SuHa tithi in Mithuna was currertt* at mean sunrise, being Saturday, and the then current nakshatra being Mrigasiras. 
ISfor does the result agree with the givendetails for the 5th yearof the king, on the supposition that his reign began,as originallyset forward by Eaelhorn, on 38th July A.D. 1108. Hence I can find no ezact agreementin any case.

This date is correct in all respectsfor the 13th yearof the reignof Vikrnma-Chdla as fixed by Professor Eaelhorn, who established the dayof the king's accession as June 29th A.D. 1118. li corresponds to Monday, June 15th A.D. 1131, the fourteenth year of the reign beginning tlnno 29th of that year and June 15th beingstill in the thirteenth year.

This day fell in the eleventh yearof Kulottunga Chflla II, which began, as at present found by me (Vol. X, p. 138, No. 190), between 26th 
March and 14th July A. D. 1143, his accession having taken place on some day between those dates in A.D. 1133. 
The stated date would "be incorrect for the eleventh year of Knl5ttunga-Ch6la I, in which year the 2nd Dhanns fell on a Thursday .(November 26 A.D, 1080), with BharanI as the nakshatra current at sunrise.

"In the [3]rd year (ofklie reign') of the emperor of the three worlds, tho Kulottunga-Choladeva, on the day of Punarvasu which correspondedto a Wednesday to the third titU of the first fortnightof the month of ^ishabha," 
Since this date is so worded as to afford DO cine as to which of the three known Kulfittrmv* gas' reign it belongs, I have tested it for each of those sovereigns j with an unsatisfactory restiH in tho end. 
In the third year of the reign of Kulsttunga-ChSlaI the 3rd gukla titU of Yaisakha in ifce polar month Vrishabh a was current at mean sunrise on Tuesday, April 24th, A.D. 1072, and also at mean sunrise on Sunday, May 12th, A.D. 1073 ;either of which days, accordingto oor 
present knowledge as to the date of that king's accession, might have fallen in his third year, In the first case the nakahatra current at mean sunrise was either Mriga&ras or Ardra accord ing to the authority used, and in the second case was Ardra by all systems, 
For the reign of Kulfittunga II we also have the choice of two years ;and the day tioned in the record, so far as the tithi is a guide, may have been Friday, May 17th, A.D, when the nafahatra was Ardra by the equal-space systemfor 7h. 1m. after mean sunrise Punarvasu by Garga and the Brahma-siddhanta; or it may have been Wednesday, May A.D. 1136, when the corresponding naksliatra was similar to that in the last ease lasting by the equal-space system for 7h. 36m. after mean sunrise. 
This latter date, therefore, would exactly tally with the given details if wo could that the panohangas of that day were calculated, in the matter of the nahhatra, either by

For the reign of Kubttunga-CMa III the 3rd Sukla ffi of Jyeshtha correspond to Monday, May 18th, A,D. 1181, which was the 25th solar day of Vvibha;on ^k-h day afc mew Kunmo tlio moon was in Punarvasu by all systems. This therefore would coincide with tlio given clato if we presumed that the week-dayhad been wrongly stated as Monday instead of Wednesday. The 3rd yukla titUi in question ended at Ih. 41m. after mean sunrise on the Monday, so that it could not be connected with the Tuesday,still less withWedne.*l.ty.I ara therefore, as before, unable to accept that date as correct. 
Prorn tlio above transliteration it appears that the number of the regnal yearU 3" ii aomewliu-t doubtful. If the number is capableof beiug certainly ascertained, no doubt the date could bo conclusively verified.1

"In iho twelfth, year (oftie reign") of the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious H&jSdhirajadeva, 011 the dayof Mtila which correspondedto a Monday and to the tenth tttlii of the second fortnightof the month of [Si]mua." 
This ditto is intrinsically wrong. During the month of Simha a tenth titU of the second fortnight can nover be connected with the ndksliatra Mula; but a tenth, iithi of the first fort night can bo HO, and I have therefore tested the date for both these daysin the reigns of Bajadhirfvjft I arid II respectively. 
Taking tlio latter first, the date must, for his 12th year,fall in A.D. 1174. In that year, in the month of Simha, the 10th krishna tiilii fell on a Friday, and the 10th gukla rtfJW also on a Friday ;the nakshatra in the second case beingMfila byall systems. As the week-d.ty is thus altogether wrong I reject this date, althoughin the second case the nakshatro, stood as 
stated, 
For the reign of BajSffliiifija I we have it, as established by KielKora,that his twelfth year Wan between March 15th and December 3rd, A.D. 1029. Hence the month of Simha in that regnal year may have been either in A.D. 1029 or 1030- In the first of these two cases th 10th kmlma titJii of Simha fell on a Thursday,the nobfoiro being Mpgafaw,This plainly Wrong.' The 10th sukla titU of Simha in A.D. 1029 was current at sunrise on Thursdayhe nakshafcraMula having expired8h. 36m. before that sunrise, ThiB also does not fit the description, ,

This date is also irregnlar. In the third yearof BujarajaIII the month of Mina fell early in A.D. 1219. The eleventh tithi of the second fortnightin that month correspondedto Thursday, March 14th 1219, -which was the twentieth day of Mina.

The date is unsatisfactory. From the details givenit would seem that the number of the regnal year is not clear. On the supposition that the number of the yearis shown by a single afohai'it I haye tested the date for every yearof RfijnrajaIll's reign from the first to the ninth inclusive, and in no case have obtained the desired combination.1 
The nearest approach was found in the 1st regnal year, Mesha of A.D. 1217, the 4th regnal year, Mesha of A.D. 1220, and the 8th regnal year, Mesha of A.D, 1224. 
In A.D. 1217 the week-day correspondingto the 5th kriehna tithi was Wednesday, and the dity was tie 5th day of MSsha, or March 29th;but the nakshatra Mula only began, by the equal space system, at Ih. 23m. after mean sunrise on that day, though at that moment (mean sunrise) the moon was in Mula bythe systems of Gargaand bythe JBrahma-siddhauta. This was in the king's first regnal year. 
In A,D. 1220 the 5th krishna tithi was current at mean sunrise of Thursday, March 26th winch was the Sod day of Mesha, having been current for the last 20h. 3m. on Hie previous Wednesday. According to the equal-space system Jyeshtha was the nakshatra current during all those hours of Wednesday, Mula only beginningIh. 38m. after mean sunrise on Thursday; though by the systemof Garga Mala was current for the last lib. 12m. and by the Brahma- siddhauta for the last 16h. ISm.sm the Wednesday. So that by these latrcr authorities Mfila and the 5th krishna titlii ran togetherfor a considerable period on Wed nesday, March 25th. But I can ascertain no reason -whythe Wednesday and not the Thursday, at vvho^e sunrise the 5th krishna titlii "was current, should have been coupled with that titlii. There was nothing special, so far as I can gather,in that titlii which would warrant a< departure from tho usual procedure of naming the day from the tifhi current at sunrise. These days in A.D. 1220 were in the king's fourth regnal year, 
In A.D. 1224 the 5th krishna ttiU fell on Wednesday, April 10th, which was the 17th day of ]\lesha, bat tho nakshatra current at mean sunrise of that day was Piirva-Ashad'ba by all systems, Mfila having ended on the Tuesday. This was in the eighth regnal yearof Rajaraja III, 
The date is irregular for his other regnal years from the first to the ninth inclusive. It is also irregular for the 6th year of either RajarajaI 'or II.

Two inscriptions, one at the Ulagalanda-Perumal templeat Kafichi, and tlio other at tbu KailaaantLtlia temple at Sevvallimedu, are dated in the year Vyaya, and expressly state the year as S. 1268 (AD. 134647) and as beingin the 9th year of this ting's reign. A third record <>t the 7th year also exists at Sevvallimedu, If these are found on examination to contain fuller details of tlie date it maybe possibleto gather from them sufficient evidence as to the date- ul' bis accession. But so far this can onlybe fixed as beingin S. 1259 or 1260, a.t?.,on some dny between IVlaich 26th A.D. 1337, the first solar dayof Mesha-Saka 1259, and March 25th A.D. 1339, tlie last solar dayof Mina Saka 1260. Consequently the thirteenth year must lit; betwesjj March A.~C). 1849 and March 1351, and the month of Tula stated in fcho present inscriptionlit Tirukacslieliui1 must correspondeither to (about) October A.D. 1349 or the same month in A.D, 1350. 
The cletails of the date are irregularfor A.D. 1349, the second titU of the second fortnight in Tula in that year falling on Tuesday, September 29fch, on which dayat menu sunrise the moou \VELS in Bharam. t doubt even if the date can be acceptedas regularfor A.D. 1350. In that year tlio second krishna titlii of K&rttika was current at mean sunrise of Monday,October 18th, tliat day being the 20th dayof Tula, and the moon at its sunrise beingin Rfthim. The tithi 
had beerx current for tbc last 21h. llm. of Sunday, October 17th, and up to 3h. 5m. before sunrise on the Monday the moon had been in Krittika, accordingto the equal-spice system. By tlie system of Gargathe moon had been in Krittika up to 15L 13m., and bythe iirahnuv sicldMnta up to 15h. 56m. before the Monday sunrise. If therefore the week-day had been stated as Sunday, the date given would have proved regularas regardsthe mMatra but wroi^ 
as regards the Utki, which should have been stated as the 1st krtshna. The- 2nd krishnii ti /' and tlie naksliatra Krittika had been togethercurrent for some hours on the Sunday,but not on tho MOTXC% ;and I can ascertain no ceremonial reason why a 2nd krishna in Kfirttika should be coupled with the day priorto that on whose sunrise it was current. 
I ITO.VC tested the date for several other years about this period but quite without success It is Taot correct for A.D. 1351, in which year the giventitlii correspondedto Friday,October 6th, wliich was the 9th Tula and on which dayat mean sunrise the moon WAB in Bhaiwii.

It is almost i-ertfiin that the iwkshutra or the tithi quotedin this inscription must be wrong, for by the equal-space syt-tcm and that of Gargathe 3rd sukla tithi in the solar month Makara, can never correspond to Sravana. while bythe Brahma- siddhanta it could only do so for about 12 minutes at the beginningof the tith-i. The moon could, however, be in Sravana on the 1st or 
2nd s"uklu Htlil of that mouth. In the presentcase I thiuk that the quotedtitlii is correct, feincc it fell on n Wednesday as stated, but that the nakshatra has been wrongly quotedas Siavtma when it should have been Dhanishtha. 
If I am correct in this supposition the givendate correspondsto Wednesday, January 2nd A.D. 1359, on which day at mean sunrise the 3rd sukla tithi was current, the day beingthe 7th civil day of Makara. The current iiakshatra at mean sunrise was, however, Dhanishtha and not Sravfina. This day being in the 20th regnal yearof Rajanariiyana Sambuvaraya we have it that his accession occurred on some daybetween January 3rd A.D. 1339 and January 2nd J34Q. As stated above, p. 251, the Kanchi and Sewallimedu inscriptions phow that the accession could not have taken place later than the last day of Saka 1260, which was March 25th A,D. 1339. And consequently, if the present date is accepted, the reign of thia king began between January 3rd and March 25th A.D. 1339. 
But if so, the last date examined, No. 241, is not regular,for it should have corresponded with a day in September- October A.D. 1351, beingin the 13th year. And for that yearit is incorrect.

"In the ninth (year) opposite to the fourth year (of the. rov/) of king Maranjadaiyan, from (ilie day o/) AsvinI which correspondedto a Monday of the month of Vrischika." 
The names of two sovereigns bearingtho title Maranjadaiyan. have been broughtto liiiht in the territories at one time subjectto the Patidyan kings. The earlier was alivo in A.D. 770 as is gathered from the Anaimalai inscription jthe later is believed to have succeeded to the throne some time in A.D. 862-63 (J3p. Ind, t Vol. IX, p. 88). No sufficient details exist for verification of the date sriven for the former. I have examined the date of the present record on the supposition that it mightrefer to that Maranjadaiyau who.^o rciguis said to havo begun in A.D. 802-63. 
It appears to belong to his thirteenth year, which would perhaps be the year A.D.

Therefore according to tho ordinary practice of Southern India tho Monday in question would have been coupled with Rcvati and not with AsvinI.

Now I understand that the 10th sukla of Alfirga^irshais considered an unlucky tithi (at least AlbGi'Oni says that it is so) ;but that the llth is peculiarly auspicioussince it is the occa sion of fbe great Vaikuniha, or Kukkoii-pkailasi, festival in Southern India, and of the nnkahada ekadasi in othei1 parts.3 And as this tit hi ran for about 5)j hours before tho end of the civil day, Monday, while the nakshaira AsvinI was similarly current for about 3| hours before the end of the day, it seems quite possible that this constituted an occasion justifying a departure from the usual practice and the couplingof the Monday in question with AsvinI instead of with Kevatl. 
If J am right in this surmise the date may be acceptedas genuine, and if so this king's reign began some time between November 23rd, A.D, 8G1, and November 22nd, 862 ; always supposing that "in the ninth year oppositethe fourth year" means"in the thirteenth year." Coupling with this the date givenin the Aivarmalai record (Z?jp, Ind., Yol IX, p. 88), which makes Saka 792 synchronouswith the king's eighth year, we have for his accession the period March 22nd to November 22nd A.D. 862. This presupposesthat the quoted Saka year 792 the current year.

The date is irregular whether for the reignof Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I, or for the second king of that name. The giventithi in Makara corresponded with a Wednesday in A.D. 1261, the llth year of Jafcavarman Sundara I, and in Januaryof A.D. 1286 which might possibly have been in the llbh yearof Jatavarman Sundara II;but the corresponding nakshatra cm those Wednesdays was either Purva or Uttara-Bhadrapada. la January12S7 the 6th tmkla tithi in Makara fell on a Tuesday, with the nakshatra Asviul current at mean sunrisej and in January 1288 it fell on a Sunday, with the nahhatra Bevati current at mean sunrise.

For the 13th yearof Jatavarman Sundara-PandyaII we may test the date in two ways, accordingas we accept one or the other of the accession periodsfixed bythe two groups of inscriptions,If .we accept the earlier period, the 5th sukla tithi of Kumbha in tie 13th year corresponded to 8 February, A.D. 1288, and at sunrise on that day the nakshatra was Asvini;but the week-day was Sunday.

then current. Examining Kielhorn's dates Nos, 11 to 18 (Ep. Ind., Vol. VI, pp. 306 ff,) I find that in six cases it is impossibleto say which system was generallyin use in the Chingleput tract during that reign ; bat No. 12 proves that in A.D. 1253, near Trichinopoly,neither the system of Garga nor that of the Brahma-siddhanta was in use, and Ho. 16 from near TanjoreshoTva that the latter was not used there in A.D. 1260. 
On the morning in question, accordingto the equal-space system, Uttara-Bhadrapada began 55 m, after mean sunrise;and though this throws a slight doubt on the date I think it may be accepted. 
For the reign of the second king of that name the date must fall in A.D. 1283 or 1284 and for those years the quotednakshatra would be incorrect ; though it is correct in all respects for Monday, June 1st, A.D. 1282, which, was the 6th day of Mithuna. And if the quoted regnal year bad been the 6th instead of the 8th, I should nave had no hesitation in acceptingit.1 As the case stands, however, I think that the date is genuine and that it belongsto the reignof Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I,

For the Sth year of Jatavarraan Sundara-Paudya I, the 10th sukla tifhi in solar Makara fell on a Srraday, at whose sunrise the nakshatra -was Krittika. Neither Echini nor the 10th ukla tithi could be connected with a Wednesday. 
IV the 8th year of Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya II the year may correspond either with A,D. 1282-83, or 1283-84, accordingto the initial date acceptedfor the reign.

But in that case either it clashes with, most of the other records of this king as to the initial date of his reign, or the regnal year is wrongly given as the 8th, when it should have been stated as the 9th. A mistake of this kind is frequently made, and J believe it to have been made in this instance,

For the reign of Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I the date is irregular,as tl* given tifhi in his 13th year fell on a Wednesday, though the nakshatra was Rehini. 
Working by the group ofinscriptions which fixes the reign of Jat&varman Sundara-Pandya II as beginning in 1276 and, therefore, his 13th year as beginning in 1288, I find the date so far satisfactory that for 4h.

This date is incorrect for the 17th yearof the reignof Jatatartnan Sundara-Pandya I, It is, however, correct for the reignof the second kingof that name. It correspondsto Monday, August 25th A.D, 1292, which was the 28th Simha, and on which dayat sunrise the llth Sukla tithi was current, the ndkshatra being TTttara-Aahadha byall systems. This was in the 17th year of the reignof Jatavarman Sundara-Paodya II.,if his accession took place on or before August 25th, A.D. 1276. 
I have given great attention to the questionof the date of accession of JatSvarman Sundara P andya II, because the evidence regardingit has hitherto been in a very unsatisfactory condi tion ; and after concluding my examination of the eleven inscriptiondates sent to me this year, which, with those previously examined by the late Professor Kielhorn and myself,m-ike a total of twenty-six records, I have come to the conclusion that this king ascended the throne on a day "bet-ween the 6th and 25th August A.D. 1276. 
As I differ from the opinion expressed by the late Professor Kieltoru and have modified the conclusions I had previously formed (above, Vol. X, pp. 144 f.)it is necessaryto state the CK.SQ at some lengbh, The difference of opinion alluded to has reference to records Nos. 23 to 27, . .KielKorn considered that the regnal yearsstated in Nos. 23 and 24 were wrong, and adhered to those given in Nos. 25 and 27. He considered that a wrong tttU had been stated in No. 26, and corrected, rightly as I think, the"13th "ittot to the 3rd. After this' correction the data

agrees with NOB. 23 and 24 as regardsthe day of the king's accession. Accepting this altera tion I think that instead of altering the regnal years givenin Nos. 23 and 24, it was those given itt Nos. 25 and 27 that requiredcorrection. It is onlyfair to remember that apparently Professor Kielhorn had, at the time that he wrote, very few inscriptionsof this king before Mm, 
With these preliminary remarks I proceedto summarize the re/mlfcs for all the records yet examined, from which it will be seen that there is now a strong presumptioain favour of the accession-date put forward by me. In the list," K"stands for Kielhorn, and"S"for Sewell. The inscription -dates are published above, in Vole. VI, pp. 310-12, VIII, pp. 278-280, and X, 
pp. 127-28 as well as in the presentarticle.
Na. 24.] DATES OF PANDYA KINGS. 261   
From this statement it will be seen that we have six dates, viz., Nos, 23, 24, 76, 77, 106 and 107 whicli as they stand, without any alteration, show that the king's accession took place in 1276 A.D, after August the 5th ; one, No. 108, which shows that it may have taken place on or before August 25, 1276; and two, which, as theystand show that it took placebefore August 27th in that year. These are NOB. 54 and 55. Also one, No. 26, which,without alteration of the regnal year, supportsthat conclusion though a wrongtithi was quoted. Seven othera, NOB. 25, 27, 52, 53, 74, 75 and 105, are not inconsistent with it if one yearis either added to or deducted from the given regnal year. Nine others are either irregularor belong to the reignof a different king.1 
Referring to my remarks on the accession-date of this kingat p. 129 of Vol. X, it will be seen that I now accept K. 26, with Kielhorn's proposedalteration, It was"intrinsically wrong"for the stated tithi, but, with the alteration made, it supportsthe accession-date which I now believe to be the correct one. With regardto two other dates, Nos. 55 and 75, I was doubtful on account of apparenterrors in them;but iu view of the lightsirwe thrown on the matter they may be accepted with those errors corrected.

upended to a Wednesday and to the thirteenth tithi of the first fortnight and to the twentieth solar day of the month of Mithuna." 
This date is irregular for any year in the reignof Jatavarman Kulas'ekhara I, at) well as for any in the reign of Maravarman Ku.la.se khara II; nor is it correct for any date between A.D. 1190 and 1350 except in the case of two years. One is in A.D. 1239 and the other is in A.D, J334. In each case the 13th s"ukla HtH coincided with the 20th dayof solar Mithuna;and in each case the week-day was Wednesday and the nakshatra current at mean sunrise was Anura dha;the only exception beingthat in ^,D. 1239,if the calculation were made by the Brahma siddhanta, Anuradha had expired 20m. before mean sunrise on that day. But this objection need not be taken into account, since that nakshatra was probablycurrent at true sunrise. 
For the year A.D. 1334 the coincidence is absolute. In the first case the given date corre sponds to Wednesday, June 15, A.D. 1239;in the second case it correspondsto Wednesday, June 15, A.D. 1334. In the first case the king's reign began after .June 15, 1237, and before June 15, 1238; in the second case the reign began after June 15, 1332, and before June 15, 1333. Carefal study of the characters and form of the original inscription will doubtless lead to certain determination as to which of these two years is the correct one.1 If this king's reign should be found to begin between 1332 and 1333 A.D., we shall have the name of a hitherto unknown Pa^dyan king, coming probably between Maravarman Kulas'e'khara II and Maravarman Para krama Pandya, and bearingthe title"Jatavarmau"accordingto custom. And if his reign began between 1237 and 1238 A.D. we shall similarly have a new "Jatavarman" between ilaravarman Sundara Pa$dya I aB^ Maravarman Sundara Pandya II, but with a certain over lapping of reigns. In the other case there is no overlapping j and if this should provecorrect the king's title will have to be, at least provisionally, stated as"Jatavarman Kulas'ekhara II."

According to the information suppliedto me, doubtless from palaaographic deduction, this inscription "belongs to a periodlater than the fifteenth century A.D., and consequently to a king whose date has nob yet been established, and with whose name we are not yet familiar. Thii may well be so, but I find it impossible, the details being givenas they'are here, to find a date which "would correspond with those details, without examining them separately for eyery year ; and this would entail a vast and perhaps unnecessary amount of labour 
Meanwhile I would point out that, if it is permissibleto supposethat this Majayarman Vikrama may be identical with the KOnerinmaikondan. Yikrama whose reign began (J3p, Ind.t "Vol. 15, p. 228) between 13th January and 27th July, A.D, 1401, the given date very fairly well fits in with his reign. In the 6th year of this king's reignthe 15th dayof Kanya corre sponded to Monday, September 13th, A,D. 1406. On that dayat mean sunrise the let tithi of the first fortnight was current, as also, by all systems, the nakshatra, Haeta. The lat sukla tithi had begun, lib. 20m. before mean sunrise, that is to say,it had been currfent for llh, 20m. on the Sunday (September 12) ;and duringthat time the nakshaira Hasta had been current byall systems, it haying begun by the equal-space system and that of Garga 17h, llm., and bytha Brahma-siddhaota 20h. 35m. before the Monday sunrise. That Sunday was a particularly fiacred day being the Mahalaya-amavasya day, with both sun and moon in Hasta. The moon's wiksTtatra has been already stated. At the moment when the 1st Sukla tithi began on the Sunday the sun's mean longitude was 165 4' 27'', proving him to have been in Hasta. 
It may he that the same conditions existed at an altogetherlater date, and the years can be examined individually if a palseographic studyof the original inscription can be undertaken which would confine possibilities within a limit of, say, 50 years.

The date is incorrect for the reignof the only Maravarman Vlra-Paadya aa yet known to history, whose 15fch year began between 13th March and 28th July, A,D. 1457. In that year tie 12th Dhanns corresponded to Friday, December 9th, A.D. 1457, on which day the 8th tithi of the second fortnight was current at mean sunrise. Put the week-day was not Saturday, and the given tithi could not be connected with Saturday ; while though the nakshatra at mean sunrise was Hasta by the Brahma^siddhanta having began 2h. 26m. earlier,it was Uttara Phalgunl by the equal-space system and that of Garga, 
In the previous year the given tithi was current at sunrise on a Monday. 
The date, however, is perfectly regularfor the 15th year of Jatavarman Vira=Pandya which year began between the llth November A.D. 1266 and the J3th July 1267, In that 15th regnal year the 14th day of Dhazms corresponded to Saturday, December 10th A.D, 1267, and at mean sunrise on that day the 8th tithi oE the second fortnight was current, haying begun 5h. 40m. before mean sunrise. Afc that sunrise the nakshatra Hasta was current by all systems. 
I think, therefore, that the date is correct, but that the record belongs to the reign of Jatavarman Vira, and not of Maravarman Vira-Pandyadeva. A study of the palaeography of the record will settle this questipu, since of course the inscription may belong to the reign of q, later sovereign, bearing the name aa given, who is not yet known to us historically.3 - If my identification is considered satisfactory the commencement of the reignof Jata varman Vim-Pandya is fixed as having taken place between December llth.

Tibetan accounts of its origin. 
As regards Tibetan -historiography in general, there are two .distinct fiohools of it fo the Central Tibetan and the West Tibetan school. Thns, the record^ referring to the intro duction oi the Tibetan alphabet varyto a certain degree, accordingto the schools of writers. Central Tibetan reeprds.-The Petersburg rQyal rals gsalbai mekng, Sarat Oh, Das' ne Ttteo-ifofyoZtoB dictionary, Tpgbarlowa and the Bodhimbr. They all agree on the following points : king Sron btsan sgampo (c. 000-650 A.D.) 6ent his minister THomni to Hindn*. tan, Southern Hindustan or Magadha, to learn rending and writing. He received instruction Libyan (thei Lijin of the Mongols) in reading and writing, and 'formed the Tibriw alphabet after the LafitBha and Vartula characters, Tibetan dBu ohau after Lantaha 
fvon, a 
certa^ 
and Tibetan dBu med after Yartula. He brought the Tibetan alphabet up to 30' 1 No. 395 rf the Madras Epigraphical collection for 1909, Read w>*M Since the above WW in print I #* aS8T1?ed that the title Wpmr*** V quite cteai. in the original.
Ko, 25.] THE TIBETAN ALPHABET. 25?   
by taking 24 from the Indian alphabet, and inventing six new characters himself. For the expression o the Tibetan vowels he added four vowel signs. 
Tlie West Tibetan school states that king Sroh btsan sgampo sent his minister Thonmi and 1 (3 f ellow students to Kashmir, to learn the characters. They learnt the characters from the Brahman Xii byin, and panditSeiige taught them the language (Sanskrit). Bringing them into agreement with the Tibetan language, they formed 24 gSal byed and Q Bins, altogether 30 characters. (The followingsentence is probablya later addition): Besides, they made them to agree with the Nagaracharacters of Kashmir and brought them into shape, 
Looking- at these two,the West Tibetan record strikes me as beingthe more original of the two. In the first place, the country from which the alphabet was broughtto Tibet, is given here as beiug Kashmir. This is more in accordance with the result of Dr, Vogel's examination of the alphabet. Then, the passage about the formingof the Tibetan alphabet after the Indian Lantsha and Vartula characters, which is altogether doubtful, is omitted b.ere. The West Tibetan account makes mention of the Indian Nagari alphabet,it is true, but this passagelooks like a later interpolation. 
&uro>ean. statements. The Central Tibetan account, which makes the Indian Lantaha and Vartialn, characters the parentsof the Tibetan alphabet, was accepted bya nnmber of European and Indian writers on this subject. Thus, Jasohke in his Tibetan grammar, p. 1, Bflys that the Tibetan script was adaptedfrom the Lantsha form of Indian characters. Griiawodel, in his Uythotojy says,that the Tibetan script was formed after the Indian 
SambHota had introduced from Magadha, and whchhe had shaped partlyafter the form of some of ttie Wartu characters of Magadha'.

Lantsha is tlie older of the two, and that from it the ordinary Tibetan alphabet rived. This has been repeated by European writers, but in view of palzeographicalevi there cannot be the slightest doubt that the tradition has reversed the real facts. 
** The ordinary Tibetan character is the more ancient of the two, and the Lantsha' fl , 
several centuries later. Both, were derived from Indian scripts, but quite independentlyof*-** other, The time of their origin can be approximately fixed, by a comparison with the cb! ' r ters used in Indian Sanskrifc inscriptions. 
"The Tibetan alphabet is based on the Indian script, which had developed from Gupta and which used to be designated by the name of Kutila. Biihler has rejected appellation and has proposedto call it 'acute-angled' (spitz-winklig).1 The Tibetan retained the characteristics of this script; acute anglesat the lower ends, small wedgtt) the tops, and in general a very ornamental and elegant appearance. Aa regards the when it was introduced into Tibet, the following points may be noted; 
"Initial a is indicated by the sign for initial a with a curve attached to the bottom the vertical, and not by a stroke to the right as in Nagari, The stroke came into general in India from about 900 A.D, [Let me note that this curve is a subjoined small 'a (No, of the Tibetan alphabet), But another ancient form of a is found in inscriptions near 
There the syllable 5m is written like that fG F.]. 
"The ja has the ancient typeof the Gupta period (with central bar to the right) which preserved in India till about 700 A.D. [The Sarada has keptthis form throughout], 
"The ta closely agrees with the corresponding Sarada letter in that the left half of the curve has disappeared, [Bat eee some forms of the 8th century. F,] 
"The da has no wedge at the lower end,as is found in India from about 700 A,D. 
the vertical is not prolonged beneath, as happens in India from about 700, Neither is tkis the case in Sarada, 
"The pha has retained its Gupta type, which existed in India till about 700 A.D, It differ* considerably from the Sarada pha. 
"The la resembles Sarada va, The vertical, as in pa is not prolonged beneath. [But see case from the 8th century. 1\] 
a has a loop, but the vertical is not prolonged beneath, Itia therefore different from the Sarada letter, hut closely resembles the Indian ma of about 700 A.D. 
"The ya is of special importance,as it has the tripartite shape, which in India changed into the bipartite form in the seventh century. [The most ancient Ladakhi ye formula from Khalatse which Dr. Vogel believes to date from o. 600 A.D., exhibits already th$ bipartite form of yfl.-*JP.] The SafadS has the .tripartite type, 
"In la we observe the same as in pa and &a : the vertical is not prolonged beneath, a& happened in India after 700 A.D, The absence of these prolongationsis the more remarkably as the Tibetan ia fond of long down-strokes.

Our conclusion is, that the Tibetan is derived from 
ip ' h suggG8t 
of TMs T'l^*T9 
he frt^T I ifc&nLa S** W*n sgampo's minister Thonmi the.fru of such learning. My reasons are the following: The script used , the so-called Central Asian Brahmi, is anothe'descendant o'f 
also SunBknt ,formulas between 600 and 800 A.D. These characters were probably the of the So~called Brutsha (BrwAo, Did) form ofwriting,' The T^kista/^on oy a number of newinvented, as is snlanguages which were first reduced to writing in Tnrkistan Then the man who taught Tkonmi iu Kashmir, is called Li byin Tvhich name doubtless means' 
wore the very places where any new kind of script might have been 
Blessing of the land Li>(blessing of Khotan), This name may be compared with such names as Khri Mun yul bymt<Blessing of the land Khnbdun,' Thus, the man who tanght Thonmi may have beea a native of Turkistan. We have a single testimonyof history for the early use of Indian characters in Western Tibet, in the Chinese 8w sJiu, where it is stated, that such characters were used in the Empire of the 'Eastern Women' (Guge), etc, The Tibetan alphabet, though probably invented earlier, may have followed the developmentof the North Indian alphabets, until it remained stationary from the 7th or 8th century. 
Regarding the languagefor which the alphabet was invented, I am of opinion, that it certainly -was the classical Tibetan. But we must not believe that classical Tibetan was generally spoken in the 7fch century. From passages occurringiu a good number of documents excavated by Sic Aural Stein in the deserts of Turkistan, we know for certain that the Tibetan dialects were then already developed to an advanced degree,It is very improbable that the prefixes should have been pronounced in full in those days. There is a possibility that Tibet waa in possession of an archaic sacred language from time immemorial, that it waa this language which was first reduced to writing, and tHat this alreadysacred language was accept* od as the language of Buddhism. In this connection the following note from Dr. Barnett's article ' Tibetan MSS., in the Stein collection' (/. B. A. flf., 1903, p. 112)will be of interest. "It -was prolbably in the reignof Khri Sron 14e btsan, if not later, thai; the larger part of the Northern Canon, including the Salistamba Sutra, was translated into Tibetan, If this be so, it is singular, that a nation, which accordingto tradition had been hitherto buried in. barbarism, should within a century and a half have accepted a new faith, assimilated its doctrines in the most scholastic form of Mahayana, and concurrently developeda culture and a political orgaui sation, whioh made it a formidable rival to the older homes of civilisation on its north-westem frontier. Probably tradition has exaggeratedthe facts; i may be that Buddhism was fairly well known in Tibet before the seventh century, and Sron btsan Bgampo was onlyita Cpnstantine. A new pageof history is openingbefore us." 
The Tibetans themselves distinguish between two typesof characters in their alphabet. One type was taken directly froin the Indian alphabet, whilst the other was invented by Thonmi S&mbHota, or his forerunners, The first typeis called gSal byed (consonants), and the second.

' As we see, there are seven Bins, instead of six. Regarding tho gSal byed, Dr, Vogel's note will suffice. Let me add a few words about the Rins. The sibilants ts, tsh, and tfoaro distinguished from the signs for the ordinary palatals byan additional stroke.- The Tibetan w is a combination of I and 6, We may say it is a 6 with a prefixed I, Also 6 with other prefixes may become a w ; thus, the West Tibetan pronunciation of the word dban, power,is wan.- The Tibetan s was derived directly from the most ancient form of the Tibetan *, by omitting the stroke on the left side of the s. The letter a is simply an inverted /. The Tibetan character for}o> may have been developed from the Indiang.'A as initial is in many dialects pronounced like gh. But aa a prefixit generally has a nasal sound, Before the nooso of the Tibetan gwas properly developed,the characters for g and 'a may have looked mush tho same. To distinguish them, 'a was furnished for a time with an additional stroke. Comparethe accompanying tables. 1 
It is strange that a, the first letter of the Indian alphabet, should be found at the end of the Tibetan alphabet. I am rather inclined to believe that it was a later development. In many ancient documents, the Tibetan a looks almost exactly like a ya} and there are a number of worda in whifh an original ya has been dropped,or been turned infco a vowel-bearer a. Thus, yan becomes 'cm; yid becomes id; yon becomes 'on, etc. Bat in its later developmentthe letter a became decidedly similar to the a of the Takari script, for which reaeon it was derived from it by General Cunningham. Aahas been noticed,old forms of the a in Ladakh are furnished with a hook at the lower left hand corner. 
Lantsha and Vartula. 
"Dr. Togel has favoured me with the following note ou Lantsha :"As regardstho Lanthsa, it is based on the Indian script of the tenth century. A characteristic of this Bcripti to which Biihler has drawn attention, are the small tails, slantingto the right from the ends of the verticals. These are most prominent in the Nagari of the 10th century, Notice also the long straight topstrokes found in Nagari. Notice especially the letters gha} jo,, tfrt (bipartite), ra (with loop).

Our conclusion is, that tbe Lafitsha was introduced into Tibet about 10.-.' A.IK ; - ; thip. iustance not from Northern, but from Eastern India. It should he rt-raoinr'n.i,' tTJ 'n the hill districts of Northern India, and probablyin the plainsof the Paujabako, SaracU WH need, and not Nfigari. The Indianalphabet was adopted wholesale and practical'.}-ici:.i: *v ?. probably because it was intended to be used for Sanskrit exclusively. 
This explains how the Tibetan tradition came to reverse the real facts, Th? Lar.tbhj* ; ^- i exclusively for the sacred language, -was considered as the holy script, ami U-UH' ^.a.ilj th belief arose that it was the original character from which the ordinaryTibetan alphabt-t was derived. The Vartula is only a variety of Lantsha." 
Although the Tibetan script has almost remained stationarysince the eighth century,it h^s undergone a few slight changes, which helpus roughlyto date audeot Jo^unieiitB anl m.Tij*- tions. The following are the chief characteristics : 
(1) The Stein MSS. from Turkistan, and stone monuments from Lhasa, of the 8th or 
9th, century. The j haB only two parallel horizontal strokes to the rightof lhi> TtrtiviK j-f : X The t in many casea looks as if the left half of the curve had not yet eutirdy dis:m*or I li> Bbape of the fh in many cases reminds ug stronglyof the old Bi-ahmi or Gajtta foim.

The 4 in many cases shows the structure of the distinctly, hi ilw connecting line between the two vertical lines moBtly proceeds from the lower t-u,l or tho nti.i'x of the left vertical line. The h mostlyhas a horizontal positionlike the h of Central Asian BrKhmi. 
Vowel signs -The i yowel sign is veryoften inverted, and, apparentlyin the older d.va ments, ioined to its coD8o,ant base. All the other vowel signs are joinedto theireon*^

No, 27. TIWARKHED PLATES OF THE BASHTRAKUTA NAffNABAJA; SAKA BY RAI BAHADUR HIR-ALAL, B.A. 
Tiwarkbed is a small village on the south bank of the AmbhSra-nadl, in the tahsil of the Betul District in the Central Provinces, It is 14 miles south of the Mul$LI which is 29 miles south-east of BadaUr, the head-quartersof Befcul District. The v has no ancient remains excepta mud fort built as a protection from the Picdari free-boot^1"8 during the declining period of the Nagpur Bhonsla rulers. This garhi, as it is called, is af>tf dug up in several places, and the site occupied by the villagers, Within its premises Nantlg*rl Gosain, a resident of Tiwarkhed, built a new house about 40 years ago. While diggingfor foundations he came upon a set of copper-plates, but not knowing what they were, he them away in hie lumber room, where they continued to enjoythe same obscurity as they had do**8 underground, until Mr. Balwant Singh, Sub-Inspeotorof Police, Multai Station house, viwited the village in the beginningof the year 1910, when Bapuji Grosain (son of Kandgiri now dead) observing that the plates contained some curious writing presented them to him for deoiphermc Jit Mr, Balwant Singh treated the plates with nitric acid to remove the accretions of centuries and then kindly forwarded them to me. It is a somewhat curious coincidence that the MultSi plates referring to the same line of kings were also found in the custody of a Gosain.1 
Our plates are two in number, each measuring of x 3J*. They are substantial, being J* thick Each plate is inscribed on one aide only, the inscribed surface giving an appearance of ft depression owing to the edges havingbeen made slightly thicker. The writing is in au excellent state of preservation ezcepfc that the left top corner of the first plate and the left Bottom corner of the senond one are a little bit corroded j still the letteringis prettyclear. The ring which was uncut when it reached my hands has a seal on a flattened out surface. Ifc is oval in shape and bears the stamp of a figure which is now indistinguishable, but the legend rfri- Iwdctotira underneath, is fairlydistinct. The record contains 16 lines, each plato bearing 8 lines. Under the eighthline the word svdhagtina is inscribed, bat this word occurs in its proper place in line 11. On the margin of the second plate there appearto be 3 figure* and 2 letters (probably after-additions) engraved one under the other, which I read as 553 shftra? meaning apparently' the year 553.' 
The characters of the record belong to the northern class of alphabets, The engraving is well done throughout. The average size of letters is about ". The orthographical peculiarities worth notice are : (1) the doublingof the letter with, a repha on, as in vistirnnS (1. If.);- but this is not uniform as in -Durgaraja (1. 2) ga has not been doubled; (2) the two different ways in whioti the vowel sign of e has been expressedas in RasMrak&tanvayS (L If.) of which the e of yeis formed by attaching the sign to the letter instead of superscribing it as in grame (I. 9) ; (3) the letter t has been doubled before r in sagdttraya (I 6") and pwtfalya ft "?)a*d dh before y in Maddhyandina-, I 7; (4) the signof 3 attached to the letters j and t is represented by an upward stroke, instead of a downward one, as in ja, of -D_urgwa,j& (I. 2) and in t of Mnnjibhattaya (1. 7) ; (5) I is not distinguished from v as in -vrdhmapya Q. 5). Final form of t occurs in line 2. 
The language is Sanskrit, but the record seems to have been composed bya clerk who did not properly remember the flskas in praise of the dynasty mentioned in the plates. He therefore introduced prose, maintaining the sense, if not the original wording which, if correctly pnfc in, would have tornod the first 6 lineq into verse. At present, theyare a mixture of verse and prose, i See Indidn Artiqtory, Vol. XVIII. p. 230, ei y.

It appears to me that the record behg a business matter no attention vas paid a to formall ri portions which were copied from memorv in the office of the record keeper, wherewith synonymous words were sometimes substituted for the original ones Wlm + any consideration for metre.2 ^DUOUS Tke inscription refers itself io the Rashtrakuta dynasty of which four kings are men- honed, It records a grantof land in the villages Tiverekheta and Ghuikheta situated on theaouth^ bank of the Amveviaraka-na^-, to one Mundibhatta, son of BvSmibhaty* a Madhyandina Brahmana of the Bharadvaja-gfofra, by king Wannar&jaS (Nandaraja ?). 'The grant was made on two occasions,viz. on the Mahakarttiki day and on a solar-eclipse, the latter at the Kapilffi-iSWfca. Apparently the Raja went to bathe there and made the gift, as did liis t-wo principal officers, Govinda in chargeoi religious affairs and Narasimgha (Narasimha) tho minister for peace and -war, who gave away 13 nivartanas (of land) of KarafLjamalaya ou tho eastern bank of the Sarasavahala and the DarbhavShalS. The charter was afterwards issued from -Achalapura and is dated in the Saka year 553 increased by eight months i.e, ia the month oi: Karttika aa bpccifiedin the text. Tre date correspondsto October 631 A.D. 
It does not, however, appear that there was a solar-eclipse in the month of Karttika. M;1 Gftkul Prasad Tswardaa (now Tabsildar of Ho^,:ingabad) informs me that there was a solar eclipse in the expired Saka year 553 on tho amavasj/aof Magha (27th January, 6S2 A.B.) i.t), after our charter was given away. But the solar-eclipse referred to must have occurred pvior to ttie date of the issue of the charter. In the Saka year 553 current, there were two" eclipses, a total one in the mouth of Sravaua on the 13th August 630 A.D. and au annular one in the month, of Magliaon 7th February631 A.D. The total eclipse having occurred at night W&H riot visible, but the annular one -was, as it occurred 17 minutes after sunrise, The former 
took place on a Monday and the latter on a Thursday. Thus while a grant made ou au cwnnvcifiya, falling on Monday (somavntz) coupled with a total eclipse would be more meritorious than th.at inade on a Thursday with an annular eclipse*it is possible that the visibility of the latter may liave counterbalanced other considerations and invested it with greater importance. So tho greater likelihood is that the grant was made on the 7th February681 A.D. And this date falls much nearer the date of the issue of the charter thau the other. 
With, regard to the historyof the Rashtrakuta dynasty,this record does not throwany addi tional light on what is known from the Malta! plates.It gives the same information (in rather a YHgue form on account of its defectiYe composition!as the Multai record, mentioning Durga uSja as "fhe original ancestor, whose son was Q-ovindaraja, from whom was born SvSmikarSjti, whose 5n -was Nannaraja (Nandaraja), whose second name Yuddhssnra ocours on the seal Qnr charter is, however, very important from, one pointof view.

four sides. None of these has been as yet identified. Dr. Fleet writingin 1889 remarked :* *Mr, Ommanneyrreported that neithei have the villages mentioned any resemblance in name to anyin the Mulbai District nor coald he discover any at all like them at HOshangabad or Jabalpur,! Ifc is therefore not even certain that the grant really belongsto the locality in which the holders of it have resided for so long a time, All that can be said on this point is that the characters show that it belongs to some partof Ceatral India, or of the Central Provinces.1 On 30th July 1909- Dr. Fleet wrote to me,eIt would be a valuable bit of work if yoncan locate this record. It is important to decide by identification of places, what localityit does belong to> because it has a bearing on three leading matters: (a) the originof that branch of the Rashtrakutas which' bad the (raruola crest; (&) the northern or southern use of the Saka era; (c) the origin of that par ticular type of Nagari. It is almost impossible that all these 5 villages should have ceased to. exist. But though some years ago I closely examined many sheets of the Indian Atlas I could not locate them. All the probabilities are that this record belongsto the south of the Narbada. I have practically satisfied myselfthat the places do not exist in Gujarat and Kfaande'sh.' Ali though it has not been possiblefoi1 me to locate with anythinglike certainty the villagesof the Multai plates, our presentcharter has come to light as if to solve the difficulty whiph antiqna-. rians have felt for the last twenty years or for the matter of that for three quarters of a century calculating from the date of the first discoveryof the Multai plates. The fact of the Bashtrakuta domination on the Multai plateauis now once for all fullyestablished inasmuch as our plates were found in th# very village where Nannaraja grantedlands to Mundibhafcta, Tiverekheta ' of the inscription is undoubtedlytie present TJwarkhed and the Amveviaraka-ad! the Am bhors-wadf on whose south bank the present villageIB still situated, As noted above, the engraver has made DO difference between b and v. \ The real name of the river appears to have been Ambeviara, lea being a pedanticaddition to make it sound like Sanskrit. Accordingto the record Gftuiklieta should also be somewhere near the Ambhora-nadl, but it is untraceable now. There is one Ghuikhed, about 40 miles south of Tiwarkheol in the Ohandur taluk of the Amraoti District of Berar, but I do not find the river runningto it. About 55 miles from Tiwarkhsd lies the town of Ellichpur (commonly pronounced Blachpur or Alachptur) which I take to be the eorruptedlform of Achalapura from, whence our charter- .purports to have been issued.' BUichpnris a well known historical2plao*j and was the head-, quarters of a district until 1905. The transposition of letters cha, and la in Achalapttra to Alacha$ura is of the same category which changed the old name of Benares from Van&rasi to V&r&ya&i* Even at the present day we often hear Lakhnau pronounced as Nakhlau and mailed as tn&tbal.

In the widely spread (and) pleasing glorious B5shtra kata lineage, wHob nas acquired reputation bythe preservationof stability there was (born) a king, the illustrious Durgaraja, justas in the (broad and charming)ocean of milk (vr&s pro duced tlie moon). His own son was the illustrious Govindaraja, His son was the illustrious SvsmikarSja, possessed of a host of subjects acquired byself-centred prowess.

The inscription supplies the new word tiwmira, which is not found in published copper plates, in the phrase tlrdtlatla-twwiira-pram&na,,1. 44. Perhaps"timira"is the correct spelling, The now verses of the inscription, which are not found in the Buguda plates, contain nothing of importance. I could onlyinfer from them that the kingdomof Madhyamarajacontained all sorts of hermits (vv. 12 niul ]',}'). There is no mention of the doingsof the king. We may gather, however, that lie was a man of great strength (v. 17), a capable archer comparable to the son of Pritha (i,e, Arjuna) (v. 16) and an ardent devotee of Siva (vv. 14 and 15), The inscription is dated twice : let, in the regnal year twenty-six : ehad-vinsatime vijaya-vard dhamana-rajye (1. 45) and againat the end, in an era which has not been specified.1 The letters on the^tbird plate have suffered very much from corrosion and the numerals of the date 'have become very indistinct. I find on prolonged examination that the numerals are 80, 8, but Messrs. Venkayya and Krishna Sastri to whom the paper waa first submitted are of opinion that nothing whatever can be discovered. If my reading of the date be correct,I would refer it to the Earsba era, though no instance of the use of this era has BO far been found in Orissa.a If my vie-ws be correct, the date of the grant would be 88 + 606=694 A.D. 
Up to this date three inscriptionsof the Sailodbhava dynastyof the Kongoda-mandala bave been published ;The Buguda platesof Madhavavarman ;!(2) the Ganjam platesof the time of Basankariija,4 and (3) the Khurda platesof Madhavaraja,5 
The first part of the inscription on the Parikud platesis in verse, like that of the Buguda plates of Midhavavarjnan, imd the first nine verses of both are identical. The tenth verse of the Buguda grant is not to be found in this record and the eleventh verse of that record appears as the tenth of the Parikud inscription, The Buguda grant furnishes the genealogyof the family from Ranabhita to Sainyabhita, while the Parikud grant carries the genealogy two generations further, 
The following tables show the genealogy according to the Buguda and Parikud grants: Buguda plates* Pdrikud plates.

The Khnrda and Ganjam plates mention three generations only: 
Kkurda plates, Qanjam platet, 
Sainyabhita 
Ya&bliita 
Madhavaraja 
MSdhavarajaII. (619-20 A,D.) 
-Both of these plates,like the Bugudaand Parikud grants, were issued from the KongSda mandala and the similarityin names as well as the name Sainyabhita found on the senla of the Bnguda, Ganjara and Khurda grantsleads one to believe that Madhava was the surname of both Yateblnta'B father and son. But the Characters of the Gaujamand Khurda grantsare mTicli older than those of the Bugudaand Pariknd plates,It may be that the former were written in the current alphabetof North Eastern India while in the latter the alphabet prevalent in the Northern Circars, was used,* If tto four grantsbe held to belongto the same country, tlien it may be affirmed with some degreeof certainty that the Sauyabfafeof the Khurda grant 
is the same as the SainyabhitaI of the Bugudaand Parikud grants, As YrtUfe is a common factor, we have to admit that SainyabhifcaII, is the same personas Madhavarajaof the Khurd* and. Ganjam plates.

Mr, Sewell about the nahshatra Sravana is -explained bya reference to the custom usually followed in fixing the day of the jivaratri in Southern India. The Sivaratri beginsat midnight, when the nakshatra Sravana must be current, and is keptall the following day. The inscription presumably refers to the nakshatra Sravana only in this sense, as it -aras not current at sunrise on the following day,

Neither the solar nor the lunar month is traceable in the inscription which only refers to a sixth tithi;but it will be observed from Table XI of my"Indian Chronology"that a 6th tithi can concur with the nakshatra Bharani only in the dark fortnightof lunar Sravana or of lunar IJhadrapada. We work for the latter in the year A.D. 1147 and find that the date corresponds to Monday, 18th August, A.D. 1147, on which day the 6th tithi of the dark fortnight ended at 39J ghatikas after mean sunrise, while Ihe naksltatra Bharani ended on the same day at 12J ghatikOs after mean sunrise.

The lunar tithi is not cited, but tbe week dayaffords a clue to the date. Duringthe 15 years A.D. 1135 to A.D. 1149 there were only two yearsin which the 16th dayof solar Vrishabha was a Sunday, and they were A.D. 1137 and A.D. 1148.

SUNDAEA-CHOLA-PANDYADEVA, 
BY K. V. StfBPvAHlUXYA AlTARj B.A.j OOTACAMOHD. 
The subjoined inscription1 is engraved on tlie base of the north -wall of the central shrine in the Gopalakrishnasvamin. temple at Mannarkoyil in the Ambasamndram talnka of the Tinnevelly district. "With the Iririd permissionof the late Rai Bahadur V. YenkayyaI edit it from au inked impression preparedin 1905. 
The inscription which is in tolerably good preservationconsists of 8 lines of TamlJ prose written in the Tamil alphabetof the periodto which the record belongs. The letters are well engraved. There are a large number of Sanskrit -words and syllablesin Grautha charac ters. 2 Two forms of ya occur, one with a closed loopto the left which occurs only in the beginning of line 1, and the other, which is more common, without this loop. The secondary S-syrnbol is, in a few cases, not separated from the consonant to which it is added. In the majority of cases the central loopsof the consonants n and n appear fully developed, though, there are instances where theyare written without the loops. Another peculiarityis that the secondary t'-flign is marked on the left top corner instead of on the head of the letters as is generally seen in records oi this period. This is especially the case with pi, vi, and U, while in ni the i- sign, is sometimes added on to the topof the letter and sometimes byits right side, according to the shape of the letter n which, in this record, is not uniform. The signs for u and u in the letters vtiu and ru are not distinguished. Only in one case a curve has been ,added ta the u in mu in order to denote the length. Exceptin the letters lai and lai where the first part of the vowel is used to denote the cn'-symbol, the secondaryai is invariably marked by two secondary e-signswritten side by side as in Grantha. The groupnta is always em ployed whenever the two letters come together. The palatal n is so shaped in some cases that it may at first sight be mistaken for na. The guttural n occurring in puraiigarai (1. 3), -Tiruvaranga- (1. 6) and Irungandi- (1. 8; and the syllable ru are peculiarly shaped. 
The object of the inscriptionis. to register a sale of land to the Vishnu temple callect RSjendrasola-Vinnagar,Lines % and 3 givethe boundaries and estent of the various fields that were sold, and line 4 describes the formal transfer of the land to the temple by the assembly of Rajaraja-chaturvedimangalam. Lines 5 and G give the names of some of the members of the assemblyat whose instance the lands appear to have been sold. The con veyance was drawn up by the accountant (Jiaranattafi) of the village and was attested by several of the persons who ordered the sale (11. 7 and 8). It is interestingto note that most of the members of the assembly were learned men, and this is indicated by the titles bJiatfa, somaydjin and Jcramavit affixed to their names. Further, it might also be pointed out that these members were not natives of the village but immigrants from other partsof Southern India, who had settled in the several suburbs (&n)of the village. A list of these suburbs and villagesis given at the end of this paper. 
This inscription is a record of one' of the Chola-Pandya kings.3 South-Indian inscriptions point to the existence of at least three Chola princes who bore the title Chola-Pandya. Bajen* dra-Chola I. (A.D. 101144), after he had subjugatedthe Pandya country,is said to have appointed his son Cho"]a-Paiidyato rule over it.* Parakesarivarman. Bajendradeva (A,D.

a It IB worthy of note {hat two of the signatures at the end of the inscription are in Sanstfit. Such admixture of Sanskrit words in a Tamil record of this period may he accounted for, to a certain extent, by the- revival of learning brought about by the imnrigratf on to the Southern country of a large number of -Brahraanas from the north as a result of the conquestsof liajendra-ChoIaL, which extended as far as the Ganges, 1 Annual Report on Epigraphy for 1905, Part II, p. 50, paragraph 25.

Jatavarman Sundara-Chola-Pandya and Maravarman Vikrama-Chola Pandya. The former of these is spoken of in a M;miiarkoyilrecord ae one of the sous of Rajendra-Chola I.3 and he is, therefore, identical with the first Chola-Piindyaruler. It is perhaps to the same kiug that ^ve must attribute inscriptions dated duringthe reignof Jatavarman alias TTdaiyar Sola-Pandyadeva found at SuchIndram.G and Seviliperi,7 though the name Sundara does not occur. 
The title Chola-Prindva givento them Recras to have boon invented 1> indicate the double fact that they were members of the Chola family and were made to rule over the Pfnidya territory. The position held by them was apparentlythat of a viceroy acting under the orders of the Chala king ruling at Tanjoro. The necessityfor their appointmentarose from the fact that the Paudyas could never be completely subdued. They continued in a state of chronic revolt against the Chola yoke during the whole periodof Cboja supremacyin Southern India.8 
The subjoined record is dated in the 13th year of the reiga of kiug Jatavarman Simdara Chola-Pandyadeva. As his accession to tho throne has been fixed at A.D. 10JO-1 from the fact that hia 15th year probablycoincided vutk the- 2-ith of his faihor,9 it follows that this inscription should have been engravedabout A.D. 1083-1 which correspondedto hia loth year. A few facts concerning the king's reigndo/serve mention,10 Hie latest known date is the 23rd year11corresponding to A.D, 1043-4, which v.-as the last yearof the reignof his father. Sundara Chola-Pandya's inscriptions have so far been traced in the ancient Piindya and Kerala dominions, i.e. in the modern districts of Madura and Tinnevelly and portionsof the Pudukkottai and Travancore States.12 His Cholapuram13inscriptionis dated in the llth year and registers the gift of a lamp by a certain SarvaLoiasraya Vishnuvardhaua-Malaaraja alias Salukki

According to the Tiruvalangadu grant, the Pandyaswere first attacked by Bajendra-Chflla I., with the result that their king deserted his country from fear. Establishinghie son Chdla Paudya as the protector of thePaudya territory, Rajendra-Chola proceeded westwards, conquered the forces of the Kerala ruler in a fearful battle and returned to hia capital leaving that country also in charge of tho same prince. That the Chola-Pandyahere referred to is none other than Jatavarman Sundara-Chola-PSudya of our record has already been noticed, It maybti pointed out now that while the stone inscriptionsof the 5th and 6th yearsof Rajendra-ChClaI. mention his conquest of the Keralas,the invasion of the Pandya countryis practically omitted in the historical introduction of all his records. If, as stated in the TirnvSlaitgato grant, the Chola king conqueredthe Keralas immediatelyafter he had overcome the Pa^dyas, the latter event would have taken placebefore A.D. 1016-7, which correspondsto hie 5th year/ It \vould thus appearthat Sundara-Chola-Pandya wa8 in charge of the two conquered countries from or prior to A.D, 1016-7, i.e. four yeara before his accession,3 That he actually ruled over tho Eeralas is borne out by some of the inscriptionsat Mannarkoyil, where mention is made of two of his Chera feudatories named Bajasimha and Eajaraja.4 In oao of his inscrip tions,5 it is stated that the Chera king (Sertmctnctr) Rajasimhabuilt the Vishnu templecalled Kajeridrasola-Vinnagar, i.e. the modern GrOpalakrishnasvamin temple at Mannarkoyil. The name of the Chora kiag conquered by Rajeudra-ChOlais not given. Nor do we know if it waa 
Rajarfija, or Uajasiriiha. 
Among the geographical names that occur in this inscription, MannarkSyil does not find a place. It secrnB to be a shortened form of Marmanarko'yil6 and probably denotes the modern Gfipalakfiahnasvamin temple. The villagein which the temple was situated, was .called Eajaraja-chaturvedimangalam fu ancient times, It was a 'brrilwiailey* in Mulli-nadu, a district of Mudigondasdla-valanadu which was a subdivision of Raja~ raja-Pandinadu. A number of hamlets appearto have been attached to this village in early days, Them>dem villagesof Ambasamudram7 and Kalladaikkurichchi8 were its southern hamlets, whib Papan.^uhniIJ(VeUrkurichchi) aud Alvarkuriehchi10 (Kaderu; text 1. 2) situated at a distance of about 8 miles from Ambasamudrarflj formed its hamlets on

(A.D. 1022-10G3). 2It cannot, however, be inferred from thia that the Pandyas remained independent even until this date, tecaTise earlier inscriptions of Rajendra-Cbola'I. hive been found in tho Tinnevelly and Madura districts. Th** existence of theae records in that partof the country might he taken to show that the Pandyas acknowledged the overloriMiip of the Chola sovereign even before the invasion, conquered &a the Pandya country washy Parautaka I. and Kajaraja I, It Tvaa perhapsthe Piirulya king's attemptto assort his independence that caused the invasion in the present instance.

The inscription opens with obeisance to the goddessSarasvati, Tien follows a request to tltt-t Dadhlmati by the community (gosUhika)of Dadhya-Brahrnanas, headed by Arighnanriga. These Brahmanas used to reside, it appears, in the game temple and were tlio 
iws of tbo devi. A passingreference is also made here to one SrI-Dhrulilana, who ^ to have been then the ruling prince, but who this chief was and where he ruled "we are unuble to ascertain.

Similarly, the numeral 4 in t<ie last line has also been represented bythe symbol (.) which is after the same Guptaor NSpSl system (& table quoted above). There is a dot after {his symbolin the crgiwl stone* but it appears to have been inadvertently engraved bythe mason. If tteaut&u wl meant 40, the sign for 40 and not that for 4 would have been used in its place, livm ue above, it is miite clear that the date of the inscriptionis of the Guptaera and nut VJaama or Hawha.

I)ahima.*Brahmanas knoivn bythis name, It therefore appearsthat it is perhapsa contracted form o the word avot$t just as the word brahnana is written in the abbreviated form br&hra in line 12, It is also possible that the letter il of the word awil has been carelessly omitted. The word SLvoti or aWil means a worshipper ;and hence it may be inferred 
that the Dadhyaa were worshippersof the goddess DadhimatI in those days. The office of wor shipping this goddess is now held bythe Sevagas (or Bhojakas).It is just possiblethat the Dadhya-Brahmanas, as theytook up some other profession,later on employeda Sevagafor this purpose, whose descendants are upto this day doingthe same work This suppositionis farther strengthened by the fact that the Dahima-Brahmanas of the village Rol, 10 miles from this temple, even now personally performthe worshipof the deity and offer oblations in her honour ia the months of Chaitra1 and Asvina whea fairs are held in and around the temple, In these fairs the inhabitants of the adjoining villages meet togetherto worshipthe goddess and offer their cattle for sale. 
The most 'noteworthy information furnished by this inscriptionis the . lightit throws on the date of the Marbandeya-fiwairuL. In line 11 of our inscriptionis quotedthe 9th verae of the 91st chapter of that Purdna or the 10th chapterof the Bevl~M$ha,tmya, as the latter begins from the 81st chapter and ends with the 93rd. From this quotation we can con 
clusively and convincinglyassert that the Devi-HaMtmya was composedbefore V. S. 665, '.a. before the 7th century A,D. It would, therefore, be futile if any one were to assign a date, later than the 7th century,to the Devi-M&Ji&tmya or the Msrkandeya-PurSna, The section D5vi>lahatinya is regarded by some scholars as an interpolation, but what can with certainty be contended* is that the Devt-Mahatmyais not a production later than the 7th centuryor 
thereafter. Bev. K. M, Banerjeawrites in the introduction to his edition of the as follows3: 
" We cannot help noticingin this placethe dignity impartedto the work under review, It is classed in the same category with the Vgdas, and described as an immediateproduct^ from Brahma's mouth, Although a Parana, it is not attributed to Vyasa, whom other Sastras consider as the author of all works bearingthat title. The M&rkandeya Piwana, however, doea not acknowledge him, as its composer, editor or compiler.3 It claims equal honour in this respect with the Vedas themselves." 
And he says in the beginningof his preface4 that"the section called Deut-M&hstmya was probably an, interpolation." A referencpto chapter 94, verse I,6 would show that when recapitulating the past, the speaker (i.e. Markandeya-Eiflhi) says that he has caused him (the addressee, i,e, Kraushtuki-Rishi) to hear the Devs-Mahtitmya,. This internal evidence alone is sufficient to prove that the Devi-J&ahtitmya,is not an interpolation but forms a. part and parcel of the Markatiijeya-Pwana,. Besides,if the Devi-Uahatmya were to be removed from it, tha 
In the months of Chaitra and tona falls the 2fttm-rair<h M. the first nine days of the bright "half of the months when woohip of the goddass is eloquently recommended in the Deti"3fakatmya. The Dahima-Mahasabhiv w contemplating to re-asaame the management of the temple which was formerlyin their own hands even when the Seragas were the worshippers. The annual meetiaga of the sablia have been held in this temple for three consecutive days in every Chaitra-Navaratxa,for the ]ast four years,, and the Mahasabha has recentlystarted a school there.

These copper-plates were found at Sevadi, a village in Bali district, GrSdwar province;- Jodhpur State. They were broughtto lightin a house in this village in oonseqaence of & freiavy downpour of raia. The news of the find reached the Police Sub-Inspector who forwarded the plates to the M&htma Kbas, "Raj Marwar. Theywere thence sent to the Historic' department (TawaTlkK Mehkma) of the State for being deciphered and for impressions being prepared therefrom. One set of impressions has been furnished to the Ajmer Museum at the request of the Curator.19 The original plates are now in charge of the Superintendent of the Tawarikh Hehkma. 
The plates are three in number, of which the first is inscribed on one aide only. The second is written on both sides, and the third bears but three lines of writing on its inner side. Tiie inscription is perhaps incomplete as shown bythe isolated and unconnected letter k& at the en 3. The average breadth of the platesis 9" while the average length is 11!'', Th edges have been slightly raised into rims, and the plates are strung on two almost circular' rings, the ends of "which are open and bear no signof anyseal. The ends of the rings are so wide apart as to permit the plates passing out of them without any difficulty. Their diameter varies from 2" to 2J% -and their thickness ia slightly over |", 
TJie inscription consists of sixty lines of writingand- is' in an almost perfectstate of preservation. The characters belongto the northern class of alphabets. Attention may be drawn to the somewhat rare forms of the letters t and &&, while the archaic formation oi?

00Ko. '32.] SEVADI OOPPEE-PLATES OF CHAHAMANA RATKAPALA. 305 the labial ^ is rather peculiarto this inscription. The language is Sanskrit; and the test is in prose wifch the exceptionof thirteen lines at the beginning and seventeen at the end containing 11 and 15 verses (numbered), respectively, although the numbers of the last two   
are omitted. In respect of orthography thefollowing may be noted: (1) the sign for is also used for &; (2) there is au indifference about the doublingof the consonants after r, e.g. -karmanau in 1. 52; (3) rules of parasamna have in some places been violated;' 
(4)^ and s have been confounded, e.g. -yasasltardni (1. 53), -sahasrani (1. 58). The object of the inscriptionis to record a grant of avillage named Gnriidakurchcha (the modern G-flndoch as we shall see later on) to Brahmanas residingin the same Village, by a Chahamana king named Ratnapaladeva, the son of Prithvipala, in Y. S. 
The inscription opens with obeisance to the god Brahman. The introductory verse extols the word svasti. A person came out of the eyeof Indra, lord of the east, while looking; and from this person sprangthe Chahamana dynasty (v. 2), which is extolled in the succeeding verse (v. 3). The next eightverses unfold thefollowing Chahamana genea 
logy. There lived a king named Lakshmana, whose son was Sohita, who is here called lord (patty of Dhara. His other name is Sfibhita.1 From him sprang Baliraja, who was succeeded by his paternal uncle1 Vigrahapala.

of warriors, tho Ghahumana race,"1 This fact is farther corroborated by an inscription where we read2 that"there was the hero Chahamana, a source of joyto the greatTiishi Vatsa,1 Professor Kielhorn also points out3 that"according to verso 12 of the Bijoli rock inscriptionof Somesvara (No. ]54 of his Northern List} Samanta, the first Cbnhumana chief, was born in the Vatsa-</ora at Ahichchhatrapnra." The current belief that the four races of ParamSras, Clialiikyas, Chahamanas and Pratiharas sprang from the agni-knndareceives no support from this insoription. 
The genealogy unfolded by our inscription,is the same as that given byProf. Kielhorn in his paper on the Chahamanas of Naddula, referred to above,as far as Prithvipala, and the name of Batnapaladeva, the hero of our inscription,is an addition to it. But an inscription recently discovered at Maudor, -when arclicaological excavations were beingcarried out ander the supervision of Dr. Marshall, reveals the name of two farther generations, ri'z., Eayapala, son oi Batnapala, aud Sahajapala, son of Rayapala.Before the discoveryof the inscription at Manddr, it was not known whoso son Eayapala was,- thoughhe was known to be a Ghaha mana from his eight inscriptions found in the GfidwSr District. From these latter we farther learn that Eayapala had besides Sahnjapala two other eons, vis., Eudrapala and Amritapala; ^hile in another inscriptionof Ratnapala (publishedin the Sh&mnagarPrSkrit and Sansknt Inscnpf-wns), the name of Ratnapala'sson is givenas Punapaksha, which I am inclined to read as Purnapala. So tho dynasticlist would no-w stand as follows :

303 EPIGRAPHTA INDIOA. |To.   
In our inscription, Sflhita is styled lord of Dhara. Sohita's time is after V.S. 10391 when Munja *as ruling over Dhara. It is possible that lie defeated Mnnja and became, for some time, lord of that city or country. This suppositionis confirmed by the fact that Sohita's son Balirgja, routed the array of Munjaraja.2 The Maharaja Juidaraja mentioned in line 26 is the same as Jesaladeva of verse 10 above. We may also note that the grant, the renewal of which is recorU'd in this inscription,is stated to have been originally made by Ma1i&r$ja M-Jajukaia the beginning of the Kali age. 
Of the localities mentioned in our inscription,all of them except5 have been identified : Guiiidakiirchcha is the modern Gundoch, 5 kos south of Pall (called Marwar-Pali), the principal town of the district of the same name and a railway station on the Jodhpur-Bikaner Railway, It is a Jagtr village held by

This Inscription is engraved on three aides of a stone pillar planted in front of the templd CTirabhadra-svSmin ia the villageof Phirangipuram23 in the Sattauapalli taluka of the Gun IDistrk't. I first saw and copiedit in April 1897. Subsequently, ruy friend Rao Sahib i alma Sastri visited the place and took an estarapageof the inscription, from which I edit it. 3 letters are cut deep and the inscription is in an excellent state of preservation, The Telugu characters and orthography of this inscription are similar to those of the ;tar&mfidi plates of Kataya-Yguaa.23 In the present inscription, however, the aspirated forma >, $ arid_p are distinguished from the nnaspirated ones bya stroke resembling the Telugu xr-e 1 affixed at the right-hand corner of the bottom of the letter. This signis not found in case of Ma, lha and &ft, the first and last of which are, however, distinguished from the responding unaspirated letters bythe presenceof the talakattu or top-stroke. Sometimes A BOtiant is unnecessarily doubled after an anusvitra as in vvri5dumddu-Q.. 103).

In all these places, metre requires the ardhanwHra only ; and this ms, no doubt, what was intended to be read, The use of the completecircle -which is the, sign of the full anusi-tim to denote the half-awm-aw,is common in inscriptions and in old manuscripts and shows that the modem signof the ardJiUnusvUra ie. the left half of a circle, had 'not jet cone into vogueat the beginningof the 15th century A.D. It shows also that ' ardlianusviira was ytirnanusvara incompletely pronounced,'as the author of the AndhrabMshalihushanam puts it, and disproves the view of some of the later grammarians who seem to think that ardhanusvara was the earlier and ytirnanusvava the later form of the' sound. It also falsities the much holder theoryof the late Prof. II, Seshagiri Sastri who held that ardlitiwsvara simplydenotes the elision of a consonant.1 In modern Telugu the wolds jnTcfa', d7chi, and noeshi are pronounced only-with an ardkamm'ara after the first vowelj bnt Kamiichoda,in his KwMrasamo/iOTam, used these words as punclvi^. danclii_ .anj noncU and madeJhem rhyme with enGhijS& evea now we hear,in th?

The languageof the inscriptionis partly Sanskrit and partly Telugu and it ia throughout ifi verse, The sixth and seventh verses are also found in theSringaradlpikd,, a commentary on the AmtvnifataliCi byKfimati-Vt'ma3, and the thirteenth verse is taken, with a slight modification, from the Madras Museum platesof Vema.3 The first verse is devoted to the praiee of the bear-incarnation of Vishnu and the second and third to the praiseof the Sun and Moon, and Viaiiyaka. In the nest vers6j the poet appropriately eulogizes the feet of Vishnu 'Which gave birth to the (Sndra) caste, which is a veritable ocean of good qualities. la that caste was born king Vema who was' a seventh emperor,4 aa it were, and an eleventh incarna- 
' tion of VishnuJ(v. 5). Vema ruled for a, long time, enjoying what was left of the kingdom .after enjoyment by Brahmans, and constructed the flight of steps from Patalagangato the summit of the Srisaila ns if to climb upto the abode of Siva (v, 6). He had an elder brother 
named Macha, who liad three* sons, i-w., king Beddivota, sii-E6matindra,and king Uaga; who were like dliarma, artlw, and ftfima personified (v. 7). Ped[d*]a-K6mati begot a son named Vema as greatas Karuain charities even as the ocean begotthe moon (v, 8). Verses 9 and 11 descdhe the military greatnessof Vema, while w. 10, 12 and 18 praisehis^charifcies which, extended from Srisaila, to Kasl (Benares), touching on the way Kumaraohala, 
Simkachala, SrikHrma and Puruahottama. The queenof this king was , who,on the second day of the dark, fortnight of the month of Plaalguna in the year Virodhi correspondingto the Saka yearcounted bythe moon, Eamas, Eamas aad the earth,. (1331), performedthe ceremonyof pratislitM (completion and dedication to poblic use)of the tank called Santanapay5nidhi (vv. 14 and 15), The next three verses contain a hyperbolical descriptionof the tank, and then follow three verses from the MaMbhSxata on the merit of digging; tanks.

and I agree "ffith the editor in consideringthat Srlnatha, who was Vallabha's contemporary, was the real author of this little poem. The poetryis certainly that of Snnatha.1 
In the introduction to his BhjmgJshandamu^the poettells us that He was a Brahmana of the PSkanuti sect. The Pakanatw are found mostlyin the Nellore District and there is a S f 
family of them at Suhlnipola, whose honsenamo i? Sriuatham (Srlnathuni). These Bnihmans usually call their sect Priinnati to distinguishit from that of Pakanati Kapus or Recldis and interpret that term as meaning the "Eastern Country." This etymology is obviously incorrect.3 The Telugu term Pakanadu is evidently derived from Tamil Pakkainadu, which, is found iu several Tamil inscriptions in the Nellore District3 and the word pakhai is the Tamil rendering of the ''Sanskrit piigu, meaning arcca-nut. Pungi, a variation of Pugi, appearsin inscriptions as the name of the country"which extended from the eastern slopes of Srigiri to the eastern sea on both sides of the river Kundi."* In my paper on the Madras Museum plates of Ysma, I was -unable to explain the signification of this term, but there is no doubt about it now. The Teluga form of pnyiis pnkao being nasal and a sect of the Reddis of the Cudappah District call themselves Pokanati and not Pakauati Reddis. 
Srinatha was a much travelled man for his times. He tells us}in a strayverse attributed to him, that he visited thu courts of the Yrjnynnagara king Harihara II. and Ravn Sarvnjna Sifigamamilu of tho Velu^'a family, and that he was patronised by Saluva Telungu Raya, Ho Bpent, however, the bi-.-t p.-irt of his life at the courts of the Recjldi chiefs of Kondavldu and JRajahnmmlry and dudiratod moat of his works cither to those chiefs or to their officers. The tru(3ition:il history of ihe Volnnnli familytells us that Lingamanayudu of that family having Ulleil Vr-iiia-Ruddi of Unjiiinnuudryin battle and taken his sword called the Nawlikttnfdprtiartijus ^rlnatha was duputml by Vema's brother Virabhadra to get back the sword and that the poet succeeded iu doing so by eulogizing Lingamanilyudu in three verses,6

dynasty -who lived during the daysof its decline, will be useful in so far at least as they, will enable us to determine with, tolerable certainty the extent of their dominions and the seata of their government, if not also their relations with their quondam viceroysin distant provinces. 
Turning to the grant itself,it may be observed that the topsof the first., second, fourth, and sixth pages of the impressions' are marked by the Telngunumerals 1, 2, 3 and 4. There also appear faint traces of the numeral 5 at the topof the eighth page. This seems to indicate that the grant was originally incised on five plates of which the first and the last were engraved only on the inner, and the intervening three on both sides. Judging from the' impressions, the plates can be said to have been in good preservation.. They measure 9f"x 7J" and seem to have had raised rims and a ring passing throughthe centre of their top. 
The alphabet is NandinSgari. The followingare some of the orthographical peculiarities and errors : 
(1) the doubling of y, t, and d after r in -twryyo (11. 9 alld 1S) 5 -scmryyena (I. 25) ; (1. 46) ;-feirttt- (1. 61) ; bkartfam (L 87) j and -sarddulamarddnnal}, (L 117) ; 
(2) the doubling of n when followed by r in maasemwrsjati (1. 81) j 
{3) the dropping of the visaryabefore sibilants in -saptamaJripati' (1. 11) and svakkaminl svatanu- (1. 18) ,* 
(4) theuseoftheowMBflra instead of class nasals in naremdraJi (1. 11); 
(1.13); Tiarara (1, 14); niramjan&M (1. 34); -bhavamchitab (L 65) j and -mamdalika- (U. 102 and 105) ; 
(5) the use of n instead of 4 in dvnnfigsn (L 58) ; 
(6) the use of I instead of I due, perhaps,to vernacular influence in Istitatit (1. 5),; -rJialihhma> (L 10) ; wi6fc*j53&0aA (1. 21) and -m(ma')rGl la- (1. 55) ; and lastly, 
(7) the use of the symbolfor ft, to denote th (1L 57 and 58). The words ehamr&i (1. 90), saiwla (1. 94), Skatf* (L 107) and dttqMfta, which occur in the Vilapafca grant1,are also found here. 
The inscription opens with obeisance.to the god Ganadhipati and consists of eighty-three Sanskrit verses. It closes with the word faVbrSpsMuin old Kauarese oharaoters.Th|first three verses invoke respectively the gods iva, Vishnu and Ganega in the manner o the British Museum Plates of SadaSivaraya,' The following eighteenverses carry the genealogyof the dynasty, partly mythical and partlyhistorical, down to Tirumaiaraya's reign and have their eract parallel in verses 3-20 of the Kon^yata grantof Vefikata H, VerseaS2J9describe-tag Tirui^rSya but record no Mfltorical facts* Wth verse 30 begins the description of the donor Srl-Bangarsyal^sonofkingTimmalaand VeagflJambS.

Suklayajuh->s<j&7w, He was the son of Varadabhatta and grandson of Balendubha^ta (vv. 55-7). 
The Tillage granted wag Maredapalli alias Krishnapuram belonging to the Rayadurga tajya girt round by Hastinavati (i.e. the modern Hampi in the Bellary District), to the Pennaventha (?-nadu) and to the BhMigumma-sma1(vv.58-9). It was to the east of the river Penna (? Northern Pennar) and south of the hill bounding the villageof Cbolasanmdra and near the cfcematfa-bush lyingeast of Mladri (lit. blue hill) situated on the outskirts of the village of Korako&ni and close to the river Penna. It was to the west of the blue elevated ground bordering on the GiMawSUgani-ltshetra and lyingto the west of Kummarllapalli, which again was the western boundary of the village of Palukur, west of the tamarind tree adjoining the -sandy tract bounding the villageof VeletL It was to the north of the stone pillar set np near the scraw tree growing on the outskirts of Timmapura. Of these places, Krishnapnram may have taken its name frorn Virakrishnama of the Kasyapa-goira, at whose instance tlie grant was made. He was the son of Varabayyappa and lord of ManinagapTua and is said to have borne the biruda Sitakaragan^anka (vv. 70-3) and to have been the terror of Dhavalanka(na).3 
The titles Sindliu-Gomnda, Sitakaraganda, Davalanka-Bhlma and Maninagapuravara dhZsvara are applied to Tinunalarajaof Udayagiri in an inscriptionof Saka-Samvat 1457, the cyclic year Manmatha, correspondingto A. D,|1535-36.3 In a copper-plate record of Saka-Samvat 1484, the cyclic year Bndhirodgarin, corresponding to A.D. 1563-64* the same epithets are given to Kvishnapa-Nayaka,son of Baiyappa-Nayaka, of Balam (Belur). Of Krishnapa Hayaka (also called Era-Erishnapa-Nayaka) Mr. Bice remarks, that he"is represented in most of the inscriptionsas the head of the family, who wa,a enfeoffed by "Krislanaraya of Vijayanagara. He was the hadapada,or bearer of the king's betel-bag".6According to Mr. Kice, Venkatadri-Nayaka, son of E^iahnapa-Nayaka, was th.e head of the Balam familyin Saka Samvat 1493, the cyclic year Dhatri, correspondingto A.D. 1576-7a. About Maainagapura Mr. Bice adds,"I have been unable to identify Maninagapura. It appearsto be a placein the Central Provinces." 
The composer of the inscription was the son of Sabhapati and the engraver Ganapaya charya, the son of Virana. These two persons also figurein the same capacities in the Tumkiir Hates o Tirumalaraya.?

Peddamndiyam1 and on another at Muddaniir,3 both of which bear records of about the same age as the subjoined inscription and belong, evidently, also to members of the same family. That these figures represent a lion and not a tiger, receives confirmation from an 
unexpected source. In a record of the llth century A.D. from the Bastar State,3 it is stated that a chief named Chandraditya, a fendatoryof the Uagavamgi king JagadSkabMsliana Maharaja Dharavarsha, was a descendant of Karikala-ChQla of the solar race, belongedto the Kasyapa-06ra, was the lord of the river Kaveri (Cauvery) and of the (historic) town of' Oraiyar (Uraiyur in the Trichinopoly district) and bore the lion-crest.4 As the kings mentioned in the Malepadu plates will also be seen from the sequelto have possessed almost the same family-titlesuand as it is not improbablethat Chandradityaof Basfcar (whose capital was Amma gama4) may have been a later member connected with some collateral branch of this same family, it may be assumed for the present, that the crest figured on the seal of the Malepadu plates, is a lion like that of Chandradifcyaof Bastar. It is curious to note also that Sir Walter Elliot in his Coins of Southern India (Plate II, Nos. 49 to 54)refers to certain specimens which bear on their obverse sides the same figure as the one under discussion and tentatively attributes them to the Pallava kingsof Vengi. The monolithic shrine at Slyamangalam whicn. was excavated in the time of the Pallava kingLalitankura (i.e., Mahendravarman I.) about the beginning of the 7th century A.D.,5 also bears sculpturesof two identical lions which face one another and are similar in designto the lion depicted on the Muddaniir stone (see accompany^ ing plate), The seals of Indravarman6 and Vikramendravavman II.7 of the Vishaiikundin family and that of the Uruvupalli platesof the early Pallava king Ywainah&rdfia ViahnugOpavarman8 bear similar figures. A small signetof lapislazuli discovered among the Buddhist ruins of Amaravati has on it the representation, of a lion with the open mouth and the raised left foreleg together with the legend Bhutisa written in early Brahmi characters of the 3rd century B.C.9 Ancient coins recently found at Bojjanakonda in the Vizagapatam district by the Superintendent, Archaeological Survey, Madras, bear almost the spme crest on their obverse sides.10 
The writing on the plates belongs to the Southern class of alphabets and closely resembles that of the Ederu plates of the Eastern Chalukya king VijayadityaII (A.D. 799 to 843) . 11 The horizontal top-strokes, often left unfinished in our plates, indicate perhaps an even earlier stage of "development. Accordingly,in many cases, we find two points (one on each side of the letter) taking the place of a complete topline. The letter A; is distinguished from r by a vertical etem which projecting from the topof the rightside of the latter, supportsover it the talakattu

In the legend about Sala, the founder of the Hoysalaj, tie Kanarese word used is puli which distinctly means<a tiger'.

Telugu-ChodaB,1 state that an ancestor of these was a certain Karikala"who caused the banks o (iliB river} Kaveii to he bnilfc by Trilochana and other kings who fixed their glances on (his> lotns feet (i.e. were subordinate tn him)."2Apparentlyhere also, the reference is to the king Karikala-Chola mentioned in the MalSpadu plates, Karikala's subordinate Trilochana was, in all probability, a Telugu contemporary whose approximate date is possible to deduce from, inscriptions. Trilochana, Trinetra, Trinayana and Mukkanti are synonymous terms and occur frequently in Telugu epigraphs with the suffix Pallava, as the name of a mythical ruler of Pallava origin who held sway over the Telugu countryat some period of its early history.3 The Pauranik genealogy of the Eastern Chalukya kings invented as early as the time of Vimaladitya,4 refers to a Trilochana-Pailava5 as the ruler of Dakshinapatha and a powerful opponent of the Chalukya adventurer Vijayaditya of Ayodhya. , This Trilschana-Pallava is, perhaps, identical with the TrilQchana of the Telugu-Chsda inscriptions and with Trinayana-Pallava and Mukkanti of other Telugu epigraphs. It may therefore be presumed that the three kings Karikala, Yijayaditya and Trilschana-Pallava. were almost contemporaneous. From tl^e account given in the Eastern Chalukya copper plates-whatever its historic value may be it appears as if five generations had intervened between the mythical king Vijayaditya and Eubia Vishnuvardhana before the latter came to rule over the VSigi-dSfr and founded the Eastern Chalukya dynasty. Dr. Fleet has proved that this Kubja-Vishnuvardhana was the younger brother of Pulakesin II.- the Satyasraya-Vallabhendra of Eastern Chalukya records- and that he succeeded to the throne as ywartja, in or about A.D. 615. Calculating backwards for five generations, we arrive at the concision that Vijayaditya of AyOdhya and, therefore, also Trite, ohana-Pallava and Karikala, must have flourished about the end of the fifth century A D 7 The history of the Pallavas at this period is obscure, and it is not unlikely that Karikala-Chol'a was supreme at the time and held the Pallava dominions under his sway.

The first two uameS bear resemble to pJavan Sundamuanda hgures ae one of the ancestor* of au unidentified Telnga-Ch^a cBiof ^rikana whoso Madras Museum plates have been noticed by Professor Kielhorn in ono of the previons volumes of thi* journal.^ A certain Dhanamjaya Eriga referred to in someepigraphiral recorda irotn tho Muddagin taluka of the Tumkur district calls himself a Chola 'ruling the Alvidi six hundred district,* Mr. Rice assigns these records, onpalteographical evidence, to about the middle of tho 8th century A.D. The Cholas of the Tmaknr district (round Nilgai and HSmavati) may have been of a common stock mbh the Cholas of CudHapah,and Dhanamjaya Kriga was oithor directly or indirectly connected with 'Dhanamjayavarman of the Mal5pa4u plates. Again, a stono record at Ealamalla5 in the Cuddapah district makes mention of a certain D[h]anamjeyundu who was ruling Kenandu, The recoid is not dated; but to judge 
from the chat-actors, it may roughlybe referred to the same periodas the Malepadu plates.It ia, therefore, not unlikely that we have here a direct reference to Dhanaihjayavarman,the last son of Naiidivarman. Mahondravikramavarmau who assumed the titles Chola-MahSrgja, Mudita 6ilSkshara and Navarama, appearsto have been so named after MahCndravikrama, a name or surname of MnhDadravarman I.,8 the Pallava contemporaryof the Western Chalukva king PulakGsin IT., in the 7th century A.D .7 After Gunamudita, of whom nothingis stated in the inscription, came Punyakumara Pflrmukhararaa to whose reignour grant belongs, Two of iha birudas annumcd by him, viz. Mardavachitta and Madanavilasa indicate some apparent affinity to Mattavilfisa and Vichitrachitta, the recognised bimdas of Mahendravarmau I.8 This rasem bianco in tlio limilas suggests,as will bs pointedout below, the possibility of some undefined relationshij), polibinal or otherwise, thab may have existed between the Cholas of the Cuddapah diatrict and tho Pullavas of Kanchi. 
Punyakumara, we are told, addressed his order to the inhabitants of his own dominion and to those of Hiranyarashtra. The latter territorial division, thoughnot actually included in the nate to him. It is not impossiblethat this waa actuallythe kingdomruled by oana

at whose request the subjoined grant was made. The river Suprayoga, on whose southern bank the village Biraparu wag situated,is mentioned againin the Uruvupalli plates of the Pallava king Yuvamahiraja Vishnugopavarman.1 It is there stated to have formed one of the- "boundaries of the Tillage of Uruvupallisituated ia the district of Munda-rashtra. Kendakfira or Kandukura, another boundary of Uruvupalli, mentioned in the same plates,is suggested by LJr. Venkayya to be identical with the modern Kandukuru,2 the headquartersof a taluka of fcliafr name in the Nellore district. And as Munda-rashtra ia probablythe same as Mundai-nadu mentioned in some of the Nellore Tamil inscriptions,3 the river SupraySgahas to be looked for somewhere in the Nellore district. Punyakumara's sway thus appearsto have extended beyond Cuddapah, even into Nellore. An inscription at Kalujavvalapadu.in the Podili division of the Fellore district refers to a chief of the solar race (to which also Punyakumara belonged) and ia V7orded almost in the same style as the stone epigraphsof the family under reference4. The existence of this record may be taken to be a further proofof the influence of the CiiGlfr kinge, in the Fellore district, alreadyat this early period. I am unable to identify the village of Birapaiu which was situated on the bank of the river SuprayOga. 
Before fixing the probable periodto which the Malepadu plates belong,it may be' useful to examine some of the allied lithic records referred to- at the beginningof this paper. One from Eamesvaram near Proddutu.ru6 and another from Chippili near Madanapalle,6' have to be as signed on palceographical evidence to Punyakumaraof the Malepadu plates, though neither of tliem which mentions him refers to the familyto which he belongedor the gdtrain which he was-born. The latter is a memorial tablet m the Kanarese language and registers that"while the glorious Punyakomaran (i.e, Punyakumara) was ruling Ohirpuli (Ohippili),Indaralarose (in rebellion ?), and (iu the conflict that ensued,a certain) Parasuraman pierced and fell." The former tells "Us : 'In the victorious and increasing yearsof the reignof the lord of the earth (yr-itJiivl" vallabha), the Choia-Maharaja Pormukharama Punyakumara, in (his) fifth year, queefi, Vasantapori-Chola-MLahadevi presentedthree hundred (measures) of land 'in the fields of Viripariti to the temple of Vasantisvara at Tarumunri- the dnati (djnapti)of the grant being a certain Marpidugu Rattagudlu." Althoughone may feel doubtful about the identity of Punyakomaran of the Chippili record, there is little doubt that Pormukharama Punyakumara of the Earnesvaram pillar inscriptionis identical with the donor of the Malepadu copper; plates, The mention in this record of (Punyakumara's?) queen Vasantapori-Oh5la-Mahadevir of (his) officer Marpidugu Rattagudlu and of the villages Yiripajiti and Taramunri is apparently of much historical interest, MarpicLugu is a narriQ.r_surname quitefamiliar to the period^.toj^ichjfeinscripjiioTi belongs and was in TLSQ among the rulingPallava sovereigns and their subordinates.7Rattagudlu is an honorific title largely used in the epigraphs under reference. Its significance, as indicated by the contest, appearsto justify our connectingit with the later Sanskrit word rashtrahuta which has been explained in the sense"the headman of a

* The awoara which is to be connected -with rw is placed ovt-r the letter lu which follo^a it. This peculiar position, of the anuwdrct is often found in the Tehgu records of this period. The pronunciation intended rofty.be either Chirnmbura or Cbir.ptmra (the modern Chilamkurn near the Kalamajh* railway station). The latter possi bility is supported by the system of spelling generally followed in Prakrit manuscripts where an anutvdra placed 
t the top of any letter hw the effect of doubling the preceding letter. The,similar position of the <tniut&ra in the words punyamlti and cakramfa (1. 23 f.) c&uuot he explained in the same, way.* Bead niljoina. * Tlie subjoined is only a tentative translation of the inscription. Its peculiarities of orthography, grammar and idiom require independent ttudy and discussion. I could only here draw particular attention to the use of jr nri for ndit, ndi, the use of the Dravidian \ for I, the wrong forms gdtrinilci for gotrunilei (L 12) and <?*< for dint (1.19), the addition of the gMetive suffix to the qualifying adjective instead of to the noon (11, 10 to 12) the use of the expletive suffix w in ce-yitjjwwt (1. 21), the ungramnutical vSvahr-vtfHfor .fje-tm^t* and, the word lot vadha. Again, I am unable to explain the phrasee titanttrv-gdnu tdgiri in 1, 18 f. Mandru is evidently the plural of rnarufa, which againis a corruptionof the Kanareai m0&w> matter* a meaaure cf land.*

This partly accounts for the fact that the (Icscoudrmts of the original P.illavas o Conieovcram continued until a verylate periodside by side with the Gaiia-?allavas.:i 
Apart from the Psillavas and the G-anga-Piillara^the five subjoined records throw consi derable light on the historyof n feudatory f;tinily which played an important partin the ancient history of So at burn India. Those are tiiu Banas, who traced their descent to the demon Mahabali. They duinito he loi'ds of Nanclagiri, -i.e. jST;mdidiMogiu the Chile- Ball fi pur till uka, Kolar District, ^Mysore!

The earliest mention of the Biinns is in the Talgund pillar inscription of the Kadamha king KakiibtUavai'man.

;or is resolved into iy as in padiyamsain from Skt. prahjama ;but it reniaias when combined with r as in paryata (1. 3 A),see rale G, and also note on asa/JaVaM (p. 218). JfoiZtf ft. Conjunct r as the second member of ail initial consonant is dropped;thus padiymsampaUyanisam (by rule l)=Skt, pratyaimt, where thedisappearingr has opre faralised the following tf (11. 2, 3 C)and xava^^mva (I,3 A), exceptin Ihnukba (1. 2) where it has persisted perhaps in consonance with the old Persian blirStar,"brother ". la a medial akshara r is retained, whether as the first member as in sarai imcl puryata (1. 3 A) and samwa (1. SB); or as the second member, as in agm (11. 2, 3 0) and parigraha (\. 4), and see Rule *. The changes in. the consonants then,it will be seen, are not random (if one mayuse the word) as so often seems to happen iu Prakrit, bat follow a consistent plan, BO that,if any word be re-adjusted according to thess rules,it appearsat once as actual Sanskrit or but one step removed therefrom, 
In considering the inflectional forms,it will be convenient to cite the words as they would appear iu their more correct Prakrit form when re-adjusted accordingto the foregoing rales, that is, to cite them from the readingin italics (p. 210 f.). 
The Prakrit of this inscription haa more affinities with Ardka-MagadM tbn with Sauraseui, if we compare the grammatical terminations that occur with those given byPigchel,1 The dative singular en<)8 in ae, both for the masculine as in Ihilgiie (1. 2), anil for the feminine as in ptiijae (11. 2, 3 0) and dcMhclilwiaS (1. 3 A) ;and these are Ardha- Ma^adhiforms. The loca'ivo singular ends apparently in nlii for the masculine and neuter,if we read iwi^mhi in KhwatmU and wferumTw (1, 1); and it is onlyin Ardha-Magadhi (aaI understmd) that the locative sing, ends in rim, from which easily comes the form inhi, that is found in Pali but not in any other Prakrit, I believe. The genitive plural ends in ami,as in sai'iibhaUihwa, (I. 2), am'hattrik&wi (1. 3 G), etc, ; and this termination is fouud in Ardha-Magadhias well as other dialects, but not apparently in Sanraseni, 
There are other peculiarities which mark this Prakrit. Tho nomin. singular masculine of nouns ending in a appears as a, and not o, as putra, k&falayika (1, 1), blujfjn, (1. 8 0)and jpari ia (1. 4) ; except in the poetical quotationin 1. 3 A, B, where the o form appearsin yd and The neuter nomiu. ends in am as in patty amfam (11. 2, 3 0) and mhSram (1. 4) both which words appear to be considered neuter instead of masculine;buU&c/io (1. 2), which should be neuter, does not support this rule and suggeststhat the nomin. also ended in a : and the accus. ends ina, as in iwlu (1. 1). The genitive masculine has its ordinary ending sa as in Artmisiyasa (1, 1), bat when used honorifically has its full form sy<t,as in Mar^asya (11, 1, 2), Bdwsliko,sya (L 2) and Mit-yagasya (1. 3 C), From other noun-bases maybe noticed the genitive Ibagavata $$kyamwie (1. 1), which=Skt, bhatjiivuttiJi Sdkijamunefy without the visarga which disappears in Prakrit;3 and a form ra of the genitive singularo! noun-bases ending in a, that ie, Skt. n, as in mata-pitara (1, 2), which is discussed in the Notes (p. 215), Among prononns we find esha used as a neuter nomin. (1. 4)3;and from idctm, not only the instramental singular imena^ (11. 1, 2), but also probably a new baseiijii.6Among the very few verbs that occur taay be noticed ifazj/o the apocopated form of Skt. blnyat (1. 2).6 The inscription records that in the year 51 and in Huvishka'a reign, Kanmgulya (or perhaps Kamakulya, by rule 1), son of Vagra Marega (or perhaps Mareka, byrule 1 ), interred a relic of

No. 18. -BANSWARA PLATES OF BHOJADEVA; [VIKRAMA-]SAMVAT 1076. BY PROFESSOR E. EULTZSCH, PH.D.;HALLE (SAALE). 
Although the approximate periodof the reignof the Paramara king Bhojadeva of I)hra is settled from references in contemporary literature,1 the only inscriptionof his time which "had "been discovered so far was the Ujjain copper- plate grantof Sunday, 24th. December, .A..D.1021.3 The copper-plate inscription now published is dated about two years earlier, vis. in the [Vikrama] year 1076, on the 5th tithi of the bright fortnight of Magha (1. 31). The date of the grant was the anniversary of the conquest of Konkana (1. 10).It follows from this that Bhojadeva had undertaken an expeditioninto the Konkan either in Samvat 1075 or in one of the years precedingit. 
The subjoined transcriptis based on an ink-impression prepared by Pandit Gauriehankar H, Ojha, Superintendent, Bajpntana Mnaenm, Ajmer, and transmitted to me by Rai Bahadnr V. Venkayya, I have received no descriptionof the original, which was found in the possession of the widow of a thathem (copper-smith) livingat Bans"wara.s But aa the impression shows two ring'holes at the bottom of the first side and at the topof the second side,it may be pre ST ned that the inscriptionis engravedon two copper-plates which are held together by two jdngs and measure 13| inches in breadth and 9|inches in height, The inscribed side of the eecond plate bears at its bottom in a rectangularboi-der (before lines 28 to 32)a flying figure of Gamda, facing the properleft and carrying a snake in his left arm. 
The alphabet ia Nagari of the same typeas in the TJjjain plates.4 The avagralia.is used, Improperly, for marking the elision of a short a after a long a in 11, 10 and 22. The consonant af is expressed by 3 throughout. Once -a ie wrongly replaced by 55,5 and ^ by ar in four caaes.6 The gerund ^T is twice spelt ^*TT.7 
The document is drawn npin Sanskrit prose mixed with verses which are nine in number, Excepting the different date and the particularsof the donee and the object granted,the new grant is practically identical with the Ujjain plates, A short abstract of it will therefore be sufficient for all purposes. 
After two verses invokingthe god Siva (Vy&makesa,v, I, or Smarar&ti, v. 2), Bhoja deva, successor of Sindhurajadeva, successor of Vakpatirajadeva, successor of Siyakadeva informs all royal officers coming to Vatapadraka included in the Ghaghradora district (bJioga) qf the Sthali province (mandala) and the Brahmanas and other inhabitants, that, at the anniversary of the conquest of Koiitana, having bathed and worshippedSiva (Bhavanipati, 1. 10), he granted 100 nivartanas (in words and figures,1. 16)of land in the above-mentioned village (I-MJ. Vatapadraka)to the Brahmana BhfiSla,, son of Vamana, of the Vasishtha gotra and the Vaji-Madhyamdina takha, whose ancestors had emigrated from Chhinchha city (sthana, }. 18)*
