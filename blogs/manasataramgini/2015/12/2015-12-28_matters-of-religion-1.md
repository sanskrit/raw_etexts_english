Indrasena had arrived at the house of Somakhya and Lootika for learning
mysterious matters of religion. Entering their fire-room he saw Somakhya
seated beside the square altar on a mat of bovine skin and Lootika
seated beside the circular altar on a similar skin with a yoktra girdle
around her waist. Indrasena seating himself in the svastikāsana on a mat
at the appropriate corner said: “Agnishad, the brāhmaṇa from Cerapada,
was a notable somayājin. Having performed the agniṣṭoma he drank soma.
But he apparently did not know the rahasya rituals. Hence, one day he
was struck by the vajra of deva Rudra and was killed. I do not wish to
go that way. O Somakhya and Lootika I seek the rahasya-s pertaining the
mysterious rituals that you were to impart to me.”

Somakhya: “These rituals are indeed mysterious. We cannot claim by any
means to have understood their mysteries in completeness. They certainly
lie beyond the reach of the nominal brāhmaṇa, who has not penetrated the
depths of the śruti or merely carries the śruti as a donkey carrying
sandalwood. We, following the path of the great Atharvan-s who have gone
before us to the realm of the frightful Yama, have grasped the merest
tip of the iceberg of mysteries placed in the śruti by the ṛṣi-s of
yore. You need not be told this O Indrasena, still let me repeat, such
mysteries can only be understood by making the offerings in the realm
that is known as Vivasvant’s seat. When the yajamāna-s make offerings
without knowing Vivasvant’s seat he is exposed to the danger of becoming
a samidh in the offering to Vivasvant’s black son before his time. Even
if does know it, he remains in danger, for the darts of Paśupati are
many. Now dear Lootika let us ensure that you are fit to be the mistress
of the ritual mysteries in this instruction of our friend Indrasena:
Expound the seat of Vivasvant.”

Lootika: “In the sūkta whose seer is unknown there is the triṣṭubh
mantra:  
yasmin devā vidathe mādayante  
vivasvataḥ sadane dhārayante |  
sūrye jyotir adadhur māsy aktūn  
pari dyotaniṃ carato ajasrā ||  
(In which ritual assembly the deva-s are exhilarated,  
in the seat of Vivasvant they cause to uphold \[the laws\]  
they placed the light in the sun and nights in the moon  
the two move the splendor in cycles unceasingly.)

The deva-s uphold the vrata-s or the laws which govern all existence in
the seat of Vivasvant. To the old ārya-s the glowing of the sun, the
lunar phases, and the cyclic movement of the sun and the moon in the
sky, were embodiments of these laws. That seat of Vivasvant is hence the
universe. At its origin the deva-s manifested as those laws. But the
seat of Vivasvant is also the ritual assembly where the deva-s are
exhilarated with the offerings of the yajamāna. Thus, when the ritualist
performs a ritual the ritual arena becomes an abstraction of the seat of
Vivasvant.”

Somakhya: “Good, you are keeping with your founding father vipra
Dīrghatamas Aucāthya. Indrasena would you back up Lootika’s statement
that the deva-s are upholding the vrata-s?”

Indrasena: “An ancient āṅgirasa states:  
yasyā devā upasthe  
vratā viśve dhārayante |  
sūryāmāsā dṛśe kam ||

(She in whose lap, deva-s  
cause to uphold all laws,  
for seeing the sun and moon.)

Here, we see a parallel to the mantra Lootika expounded and vrata is
explicitly mentioned. Just as the seat of Vivasvant is the universe
represented as the ritual arena, so also the lap of the goddess Pṛśni,
the consort of Rudra and the mother of the Marut-s, is also a metaphor
for the same, the female cognate of the same. Hence, Lootika was correct
in supplying vrata-s in the previous mantra.”

Somakhya: “Good. With the knowledge of Vivasvant’s seat and its other
cognates in place the ritualist must call upon Vivasvant so that he
makes us fearless of the fears culminating in the approach of his son.
So the ritualist utters the incantation:  
vivasvān no abhyaṃ kṛṇotu |  
(May Vivasvant make us fearless.)

Now Indrasena drink the soma from the graha and utter the mantra of the
‘avarodhana’ (the descending bridge) to protect yourself from Yama
Vaivasvata and expound it.”

Indrasena: “The ṛṣi Kaśyapa, who was one of the first Soma ritualists,
said in his mantra:  
atra rājā vaivasvato yatrāvarodhanaṃ divaḥ |  
yatrāmūr yahvatīr āpas tatra mām amṛtaṃ kṛdhī indrāyendo pari srava ||  
(Here where Vaivasvata is king, there is a descending bridge from the
heaven,  
where the fresh, ever-flowing waters are, there make me immortal, may
the Soma drop flow around for Indra\!)

The bridge, which descends from the divine realm to that of Vaivasvata,
should be seen as the stars in the region of the constellation of Orion,
where the two dogs of Yama (Canis Major and Canis Minor) stand guard.
The fresh ever-flowing waters there represent the Milky Way. The Indu in
the ritual arena is the Ephedra juice but in the celestial realm is
actually the moon, the celestial Soma. That is why the prefix pari is
used with verb sru.”

Somakhya then continued: “You have mastered the rahasya of the
avarodhana and thus protected yourself. The ritualist then needs to be
mindful of the link to the seat of Vivasvant, which is like an umbilical
cord connecting him during the ritual, where he experiences the presence
of the deva-s. This has been laid out by the prince Parucchepa Daivodāsi
in his mantra thusly:  
astu śrauṣaṭ puro agnīṃ dhiyā dadha  
ā nu tac chardho divyaṃ vṛṇīmaha indravāyū vṛṇīmahe |  
yad dha krāṇā vivasvati nābhā saṃdāyi navyasī |  
adha pra sū na upa yantu dhītayo devāṃ acchā na dhītayaḥ ||  
(So be it, he shall hear\! I place Agni in front through my
mantra-thought,  
Now here we choose the divine host (Marut-s); we chose Indra and Vayu.  
When indeed we are swiftly linked to the nave in Vivasvant’s \[seat\],  
then may our mantra-thoughts travel forth, as if the mantra-thoughts are
going towards the deva-s.)

Note that the astu śrauṣaṭ is one of the five ritual calls that are said
to constitute the ritual itself and also stand for the five animals the
old ārya-s greatly valued. They are  
o3 śrāvaya (Make the devatā hear)  
astu śrauṣaṭ (So be it, he shall hear)  
yaja (worship \[the devatā\])  
ye3 yajāmahe (we are those who worship) \[the devatā\]  
vau3ṣaṭ (May \[Agni\] bear the offering \[to the deva-s\]

Thus, having known this, at the seat of Vivasvant he invokes the fierce
Indra the lord of the battle.”

Looking at fire at his altar Somakhya gave the call: “indram ā3 vaha
|”  
He then followed it with the ghee offering directly with the sruva: ye3
yajāmahe indraṃ svāhā| idam indrāya na mama |

Indrasena note that these svāhā offerings should be made with the devatā
in the accusative case because the deity is the object of the verb
yajāmahe.

Somakhya invoked Indra: “  
yudhendro mahnā varivaś cakāra  
devebhyaḥ satpatiś carṣaṇiprāḥ |  
vivasvataḥ sadane asya tāni  
viprā ukthebhiḥ kavayo gṛṇanti || śrau3ṣaṭ  
(In battle through his greatness Indra had made the wide space for the
deva-s,  
he is the lord of all that exists, the leader of all the peoples.  
At the seat of Vivasvant these \[acts\] of his  
the vipra-s, the kavi-s recite with their chants.)”

Then he said: “With this mantra of the great ṛṣi Viśvāmitra we should
invoke Indra, who through his great acts in battle made the universe
that of the deva-s, and then with the name of Viṣṇu filling the sruk
with the sruva make the offering.  
ye3 yajāmahe  
sasānātyāṃ uta sūryaṃ sasānendraḥ  
sasāna purubhojasaṃ gām |  
hiraṇyayam uta bhogaṃ sasāna   
hatvī dasyūn prāryaṃ varṇam āvat || vau3ṣaṭ | idam indrāya na mama ||  
(Indra won the horses, and also he gained the sun,  
he gained the cow, the source of much food,  
and also the wealth of gold he conquered;  
Having slain the dasyu-s he aided the ārya color.)

Thus, we must worship Indra so that we are sthavira-s in the battle with
the dasyu-s.”

Turning to Lootika, Somakhya called upon her: “aindryā gārhapatyam
upatiṣṭhasva |”  
Lootika then clarified this point to Indrasena: “Note the use of the
verb upa-sthā in the ātmanepada. This has been specified by the
sūtra: upān mantra-karaṇe | of sage Pāṇini. When the when prefix upa
is used with verb sthā in the context of ritual to the deva-s then the
verb takes the ātmanepada.

The Lootika continued with the invocation at her altar:  
“ahastā yad apadī vardhata kṣāḥ śacībhir vedyānām |  
Śuṣṇam pari pradakṣiṇid viśvāyave ni śiśnathaḥ || śrau3ṣaṭ  
(When handless and footless the earth grew by her powers of wise
means,  
you went clockwise around Śuṣṇa and for all life \[or for all the āyu-s
\] you struck him down.)”

Then she made an offering with the juhū ladle into the fire at her
altar:  
ye yajāmahe  
vy ānaḻ indraḥ pṛtanāḥ svojā āsmai yatante sakhyāya pūrvīḥ |  
ā smā rathaṃ na pṛtanāsu tiṣṭha yam bhadrayā sumatyā codayāse || vau3ṣaṭ
| idam indrāya na mama ||  
(The most mighty indra has pierced the enemy ranks;  
Many foremost \[warriors\] go to him for friendship.  
\[O Indra\]mount your car as though for battle;  
you drive forth for \[bringing\] fortune and favor.)

Then Somakhya stood up recited the praise of Indra:  
“tvam āyasam prati vartayo gor  
divo aśmānam upanītam ṛbhvā |  
kutsāya yatra puruhūta vanvañ  
chuṣṇam anantaiḥ pariyāsi vadhaiḥ ||+ oṃ  
(You, the skillful one, spun away the metal stone of heaven led close to
the cow;  
when for Kutsa, O much invoked one, winning over Śuṣṇa you surrounded
him with endless deadly missiles.)

purā yat sūras tamaso apītes  
tam adrivaḥ phaligaṃ hetim asya |  
Śuṣṇasya cit parihitaṃ yad ojo  
divas pari sugrathitaṃ tad ādaḥ ||  
(Before when the sun enters the darkness, hurl the missile at the cave,
O one with the stones\!  
Indeed, the might of Śuṣṇa which surrounded him, that you tore off from
the heaven \[though\] it was well-knotted around \[it\].

indro divaḥ pratimānam pṛthivyā  
viśvā veda savanā hanti Śuṣṇam |  
mahīṃ cid dyām ātanot sūryeṇa  
cāskambha cit kambhanena skabhīyān ||+oṃ  
(Indra is the image of heaven and earth,  
he knows all the \[Soma\] pressings \[and\] slays Śuṣṇa,  
indeed, earth and heaven he extended with the sun,  
He verily held up the world by the world-axis, he is the primary world
axis.)”

Indrasena: “There are many mysteries here that are not easily
grasped.”  
Somakhya: “That is true. Some of them lie beyond our reach because the
original aindra religion of our ancestors has been fogged by the later
dominance of the divergent sects. Yet,we must admire the great effort of
prime minister Sāyaṇa who attempted to penetrate these mysteries as one
of the first tasks when the nation of the Hindus was revived from the
Śuṣṇa-like grip of the marūnmatta-s.”  
Indrasena: “No doubt we must uphold the tradition of Śaunaka as that
somapāyin who followed the deva-dharma from the Rāṣṭraka country had
said to me when I was young. We must labor on with what survives,
deprecating the kautsa ignorance that spread among the ritualists.”

Lootika: “The lesser mysteries are those of grammar. Indrasena, you
might have noticed that the reduplicated perfect form of the verb skambh
as being cāskambha. In every day language we use caskambha. This
elongation of the first syllable in the śruti is accounted for by the
great grammarian under the sūtra: ‘tujādīnām dīrgho ‘bhyāsasya |‘…”  
Indrasena: “Yes. Another well-known example of that would be the perfect
verb in: ‘sa dādhāra yaḥ pṛthivīṃ dyām uta |‘”  
Lootika: “Correct. Further, because it is liṭ of skambh it refers to the
ancient, unwitnessed past (i.e. parokṣe liṭ). Hence it refers to the
time of the origin, when Indra made the universe expand. He is that
which holds the boundaries of the universe wide apart; hence he is
called the skabhīyān. Another grammatical point of note in this regard
is the loss of the ‘s’ from the word skambhana in the śruti after the
cit. Thus, we have cit kambhanena. Indra is also the model of the
universe itself; hence, indro divaḥ pratimānam pṛthivyā.”  
Indrasena: “Indeed, that is affirmed by ṛṣi Gṛtsamada: yo viśvasya
pratimānam babhūva |  
Somakhya: “Good. This, O Indrasena, is the rahasya the Atharvan is
mindful off when he utters the incantation: oṃ bhūr bhuvaḥ suvar janad
vṛdhat karad ruhan mahat tac cham om indravato havāmahe |

To continue on the matter of grammar that Lootika brought up, as a
historical aside, it appears that the reduplicated liṭ was at best weak
in the core Indo-European language. It appears to have developed as an
obligate form, which we see in our language, only in the group that
includes Graeco-Armenian and Indo-Iranian. We suspect that this supports
a Graeco-Armeno-Aryan clade in the ancestor of which this development
occurred in the Caucasus region. Under this hypothesis the satem
development happened after the Indo-Iranian split off and then moved in
proximity to the clade Balto-Slavic to influence it.”

Indrasena: “The Graeco-Armeno-Aryan clade is also probably supported by
the emergence of the prefix-augmented imperfects (laṅ) and aorists (luṅ)
occurring along side the unaugmented forms resembling them.”

Somakhya: “I also tend to favor that view – the simultaneous occurrence
of the augmented and unaugmented forms is likely to be a synapomorphy of
the Graeco-Armeno-Aryan clade. However, the repeated loss of it, both on
the Greek and our side warrants us to be a bit cautious. While we are
talking about these forms you might have noted that prati vartayaḥ and
vardhata in the deployed mantra-s, which are such unaugmented parasmai-
and ātmane-pada formations.”

Lootika: “The grammar, with links to earlier IE clades, apart, the
semantics are where the greater mysteries lie. One mystery pertains to
what the ‘growing of the of the Earth’ means?”  
Somakhya: “The learned prime minister holds that it represents the
growth of vegetation on the earth. Given that the dānava Śuṣṇa is said
to be the demon of drought, when he enveloped the earth, the earth by
her ‘wise means’ i.e. counter-māyā made the vegetation grow in spite of
him. But there are many other mysteries that are much harder to unveil.”

Lootika: “What is the metal stone of the heaven, alluded to in multiple
mantra-s? What is the cow which from which it was turned away? Why does
Indra always have to go around or surround Śuṣṇa, as though circling the
sacrificial animal, before killing him? What are the knots by which
Śuṣṇa is well-tethered to the heavens?”

Indrasena: “These indeed seem rather mysterious when one compares it to
the one good survival of the Śuṣṇa legend I am aware of from the
brāhmaṇa portion of the Kāṭhaka-saṃhitā:  
‘The deva-s and the asura-s were at war. But amṛta was with the asura-s,
within Śuṣṇa. Whenever a deva would be killed he could not be revived.
But when the deva-s killed an asura, Śuṣṇa would breath upon him with
the amṛta and revive him. Indra realized that the amṛta was with the
asura-s within Śuṣṇa. So Indra took the form of a ball of honey and
placed himself on Śuṣṇa’s path. Śuṣṇa ate it up. Indra immediately
became a golden eagle and seizing the amṛta flew out of Śuṣṇa’s mouth.
Hence, the golden eagle is the mightiest of the birds because he is one
form of Indra. He who knows this possesses the amṛtavidyā.’ There is
some subliminal connection between this later reflex of the legend and
the earlier ones in the ādiśruti. What could it be?”

Somakhya: “While not all the mysteries are clear to us it is indeed true
that these legends have a connection. We posit that the Śuṣṇa cycle had
many branches of which only one survives in any detail. There was an
earthly version which was associated was probably associated with Śuṣṇa
as the bringer of drought. There was a heavenly version, which took
multiple forms itself: There are indirect allusions to Śuṣṇa’s
serpentine nature, which might relate to him tying himself around the
heavens (also perhaps supported by Eastern Iranic etymologies for
snake). There is also a form of the legend where Indra is said to steal
the wheel of the sun in the sky during the Śuṣṇa battle. E.g. ṛśi
Agastya says:  
muṣāya sūryaṃ kave  
cakram īśāna ojasā |  
vaha śuṣṇāya vadhaṃ  
kutsaṃ vātasyāśvaiḥ ||  
O kavi \[Indra\] steal the wheel, \[i.e.\] the sun,  
he \[Indra\] who by his might is the overlord,  
bear Kutsa with the horses of wind,  
for the slaying of Śuṣṇa

There is the allusion to the sun about head into the darkness of the
cave when Indra deploys his missiles. We propose that the cow from which
Indra turns away the metal stone is again the sun. We do think these
allusions are indeed related to the later reflex of the legend of the
Kāṭhaka-s that you narrated. The ball of honey is the sun – a
metaphor given the yellowness of honey. Hence, we posit that mysteries
of these legends of Śuṣṇa – the stealing of the sun-wheel, the stone of
heaven approaching the sun, Śuṣṇa eating the honey ball, Indra slaying
Śuṣṇa just as the sun was entering the darkness of the cave – are all
associated with the phenomenon of the eclipse. I am sure you see the
parallels to the even later reverberations of these through the sphere
of legends.”

Indrasena: “How could one not? In the Viṣṇu cycle the serpentine Rāhu
swallows the sun; He is one among the asura-s who held the amṛta in his
mouth; he achieved it by deploying his māyā; the amṛta was stolen from
the asura-s by Viṣṇu in his female form. Viṣṇu severs Rāhu’s head with
the cakra. This parallels another legend in which Indra too wields the
sun as his cakra to slay Vala; Gṛtsamada states:  
avartayat sūryo na cakram  
bhinad valam indro aṅgirasvān ||”  
Lootika: “Thus, we can see many motifs come together in different ways.
The eagle stealing the amṛta is of old Indo-European vintage. Moving
further afield, the motif of stealing the āmṛta from asura-s reappears
in the later legend of āṅgirasa Kaca stealing the saṃjīvanī from Uśanas
Kāvya while being within him, having entered via his beer. The same
Uśanas Kāvya is associated with the Śuṣṇa-hatya along with Kutsa
Ārjuneya; in this legend perhaps the Kutsa is a heavenly figure rather
than the āṅgirasa ṛṣi. And then perhaps Indra going around or encircling
Śuṣṇa is an allusion to circlings of the heavenly bodies in course of
the phenomena like eclipses.”

Somakhya: “Some of these are still at the edge of the veil; some
mysteries still remain but mindful of the rahasya-s we do know we must
thus perform the ritual to Maghavan.”
