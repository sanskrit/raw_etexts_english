<p class="TXT">‘Worship (you) the sun-god, the ruler of the worlds, who is crowned with rays, (nay) who appears at the horizon (every day without fail), who is greeted by gods and demons (alike) and brings light (to the world). Indeed, he is the embodiment of all gods and full of glory and creates and sustains the gods and the demons as well as their worlds, by his rays.

He has seven green horses (yoked to his chariot), is myriad-rayed, full of rays, the destroyer of darkness, the source of happiness, the mitigator of the suffering of his devotees, the infuser of life in the lifeless cosmic egg, all-pervading and the cause of the creation, preservation and destruction of the <br/>universe. He is blissful by nature, the ruler of all, the bringer of  day and the Teacher. As a son of Aditi, he bears the fire of dissolution in his womb, is bliss personified and all-enveloping (like space), the destroyer of cold, the lord of the heavens, the disperser of darkness, a master of the three Vedas (Rik, Sama and Yajus), the sender of thick showers and the friend (giver) of water. He courses swiftly along his own orbit, carries in him the resolve to evolve the universe and is adorned with a circle of rays. He is death (itself)’ tawny (of hue) and the destroyer of all. He is omniscient, all-formed, endowed with extraordinary brilliance, oppery, the source of all evolutes, the controller of (all) lunar mansions, planets and stars, the creator of all, the resplendent among the splendid.

Planted in (all) created beings (as their Inner Controller), he remains awake when they have fallen asleep. Nay, he himself is the act of pouring oblations into the sacred fire as well as the fruit attained by those who pour such oblations. Nay, he comprises (all) the gods as well as the sarifices as also the fruit of sacrifices. Again, he is the Supreme Controller of (all) activities which are found in all living beings. No individual celebrating the aforesaid Lord (through the foregoing encomium) in straits, in difficulties, in the woods as well as in times of peril’ comes to grief, O scion of Raghu! Worship the aforesaid Lord of the universe, the adored of (all) gods, with a concentrated mind. Muttering this praise (as many as) three times, one will come out victorious in combats. You will (be able to) make short work of Ravana this (very) moment, O mighty armed one !’ Saying so, the celebrated Sage Agastya thereupon left in the same way as he had come. (22—27)</p>

<p class="TXT">‘Hearing this advice, Sri Rama (scion of Raghu), who was endowed with extraordinary energy and had a subdued mind, found his grief immediately dissipated. Nay, feeling greatly delighted, he retained the alleluia in his memory. Sipping water thrice (with the name of the Lord on his lips) and getting purified (in this way), (nay) looking intently on (the orb of) the sun and repeating this prayer, the valiant one experienced supreme felicity. Seizing hold of his bow (afterwards) and fixing his eyes on Ravana, the hero (who felt delighted in mind) advanced (on the battlefield) with a view to attaining victory (in combat). He stood vowed to kill Ravana with an intense and all sided effort. Delighted in mind to gaze on Sri Rama, (nay) feeling supremely exhilarated on perceiving the destruction of Ravana (the ruler of the night-stalkers) at hand, the sun-god, standing (in person) in the midst of a host of gods, exclaimed: “Make haste!” (28—31)</p>
