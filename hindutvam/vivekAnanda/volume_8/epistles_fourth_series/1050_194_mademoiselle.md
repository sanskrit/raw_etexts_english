## CXCIV

(*Translated from the original in French*)

*To Madame Emma Calve*

6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS, PARIS,  
*October, 1900*.

MY DEAR MADEMOISELLE,

I have been very happy and content here. I am having the best of times
after many years. I find life here with Mr. Bois very satisfactory — the
books, the calm, and the absence of everything that usually troubles me.

But I don't know what kind of destiny is waiting for me now.

My letter is funny, isn't it? But it is my first attempt.

Yours faithfully,  
VIVEKANANDA.
