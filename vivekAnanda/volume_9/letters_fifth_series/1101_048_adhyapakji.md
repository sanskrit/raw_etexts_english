## XLVIII

*To Professor John H. Wright*

54 W. 33 STREET  
NEW YORK

*1 February 1895*

DEAR ADHYAPAKJI,

You must be immersed in your work now; however, taking advantage of your
kindness to me, I want to bother you a little.

What was the original Greek idea of the soul, both philosophical and
popular? What books can I consult (Translations, of course) to get it?

So with the Egyptians and Babylonians and Jews?

Will you kindly name me the books? I am sure you are perfectly well and
so are Mrs. Wright and the children.

Ever gratefully and fraternally,

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA
