## IV

(Translated from [Bengali](b6039e9004.pdf) )

*To Balaram Bose*

GHAZIPUR  
*March 12, 1890*

BALARAM BABU,

As soon as you get the railway receipt, please send someone to the
railway warehouse at Fairlie Place (Calcutta) to pick up the roses and
send them on to Shashi. See that there is no delay in bringing or
sending them.

Baburam is going to Allahabad soon. I am going elsewhere.

NARENDRA

PS. Know it for certain that everything will be spoiled if delayed.
