title = "Translating an ancient mantra: R^igveda 2.34.09"

+++
Sometimes translating even a single vaidika mantra can take some effort.
In large part this is due to three factors: 1) The vocabulary- there are
several words that have become otiose in classical Sanskrit and modern
Indian languages; 2) verb conjugations which are not found in the
classical language, and often retain a form closer to the
proto-IndoEuropean state; 3) Metrical adjustments which need to be
distinguished from archaisms. In light of all this, one cannot but
admire the colossal performance of the great prime minister of the early
Vijayanagaran empire in his commentary on the RV. Notably sAyaNa was
operating without the advantage of comparative linguistics of IE
languages. No doubt his project marked a highpoint in the Hindu revival
after the fall of bhArata to the turuShka-s – it played the same role in
the intellectual sphere as the blades of the swords of the saMgama clan
did in the military sphere.

Let us consider one example of vaidika mantra that is superficially
simple but takes some effort to translate correctly. The mantra is from
a sUkta by the R^iShi gR^itsamada shunahotra shaunaka bhArgava, the
founder of the kevala bhArgava clan of the shaunaka-s. The sUkta is
primarily to the marut-s who are in some of its mantra-s are invoked
along with other deva-s like rudra, vasu-s and viShNu. It is in the
jagati meter which is 4\*12 syllables. The first pada is 11 syllabled
and is restored by taking martyaH as martiyaH

yo no maruto vR^ikatAti martyo ripur dadhe vasavo rakShatA riShaH |  
vartayata tapuShA chakriyAbhi tam ava rudrA ashaso hantanA vadhaH || RV
2.34.09

yaH= who (pronoun); naH= us (pronoun); marutaH= marut-s (vocative
plural); vR^ikatAti= in the midst of wolves (locative singular);
martyaH=mortal (nominative singular); ripuH= enemy (nominative
singular); dadhe= placed (3rd person perfect atmane ); vasavaH= vasu-s
(vocative plural); rakShata+= protect (imperative 2nd person plural;
elongated metrically); riShaH= harm (ablative singular of riSh) |

vartayata= spin (imperative 2nd person plural); tapuShA= fiery
(adjective); chakriyA= with discus (instrumental singular of chakrI);
abhi= against (goes with verb as abhi-vart); tam= him (accusative, 3rd
person pronoun); ava= away; rudrA= rudra-s, i.e. marut-s (vocative
plural); ashasaH= hater (ablative singular of ashas); hantana+= strike
(imperative 2nd person plural; elongated metrically: ava-hantana);
vadhaH= weapon (accusative of neuter noun vadhas; compare with neuter
noun vadhar) ||

The key points of note here are:  
\* vR^ikatAt: an unusual Vedic word meaning among wolves.  
\* Both the 2nd person plural imperatives rakShata and hantana are
metrically elongated to fit the guru syllable scan of the jagati.  
\* hantana is an unusual form of the 2nd person imperative plural of
han, the like of which is only seen in the vaidika language. It is an
inheritance from proto-IndoEuropean because in Hittite we encounter such
-ten extensions which correspond to the -tan base in hantana: compare
with the form kuenten- slay in Hittite. Other comparable vaidika
imperative forms are: bravItana, etana.  
\* chakrI is used instead of the more common chakram and its
instrumental is given in a fully resolved form, i.e. chakriyA instead of
chakrya which would be typical. The discus is used as a weapon by indra,
puShan, marut-s in the veda and vAyu in the avesta (vAiyum
zaraNyô-chakhrem ýazamaide |). In RV 8.96.9 a battle between the demons
and the deva-s is mentioned where the marut-s wield sharp spears in
formation while indra at their head fights with both his vajra and
chakra. In the latter texts it is used primarily by viShNu.  
\* ashas- A rare word in the R^igveda coming only once again in a mantra
of vAmadeva gautama to agni the slayer of rakShas (daha ashaso rakShasaH
pahy asmAn; RV 4.4.15c). sAyaNa based on this suggests that the ashas
here could be a rakShas.  
\*vadhas- The RV has a parallel neuter noun vadhar which means a weapon.
For instance, in the famed first person sUkta where indra speaks, he
says: “ahaM shuShNasya shnathitA vadhar yamaM na yo rara AryaM nAma
dasyave |” i.e. I am shuShNa’s slayer, \[by me was wielded\] the
yama-weapon \[i.e. death weapon\]; I did not give up the name which of
the Arya-s to the dasyu-s. But this represents the one rare instance
where instead of the more frequent vadhar the parallel form vadhas is
used.

Thus we may come up with the translation:  
O marut-s, O vasu-s, protect us from harm, the mortal enemy who has us
placed among the wolves;  
Spin against him with the fiery discus; O rudra-s strike away the weapon
from the hater (a rakShas).

What we have here is an early example of the second person imperative
mantra that is common in the later Hindu traditions, especially in the
tAntrika mantrashAstra. Some of the same imperative verbs are commonly
used such as hana, rakSha, daha, pAhi (latter two in RV 4.4.15). This
represents of one of the elements of continuity between tAntrika and
vaidika mantra [which we had discussed
before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/09/10/some-notes-on-the-evolution-of-the-mantra-shastra/).
