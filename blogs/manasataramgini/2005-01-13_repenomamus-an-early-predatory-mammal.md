A fossil of the early branching mammal Repenomamus robustus and related
species Repenomamus giganticus (may be even a larger version of the
previous species) were recently described from fossil found in the
Liaoning Province, China. R.robustus had a juvenile Psittacosaurus in
its gut, suggesting it was one the earliest classical mammals of
sufficiently large size to prey on other vertebrates. However, the
mammals do not appear to have been major predators in the Mesozoic and
Repenomamus may be more of an exception (?). However, the immediate
ancestors of the mammals, Triassic pro-mammals were definitely larger
active predators.
