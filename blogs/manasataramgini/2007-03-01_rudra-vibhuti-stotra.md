The current version seems to have a corruption in area indicted in red.
None of the printed or manuscript copies that I have accessed allow
correction of this.

The vibhUti strotraM begins with the mantras known as pa\~nchAkSharI
vibhavas. These are the mantra-s typical of the lAkulIsha-pAshupata
school and differ in structure from those typical of the mantra-mArga
school (“classical tantric mantras”). Then it enters a section of the
leaders of various categories that are appointed by rudra. It finally
concludes by stating that even as the leaders of each of these
categories have been narrated so is maheshvara the lord of the universe.
The chapter 1.158 of the li\~Nga purANa states that shiva anointed the
leaders of these categories and gives the above list. These categories
and their leaders are closely related to the vibhUtis of viShNu narrated
by kR^iShNa devakIputra in the bhagavad gItA. This suggests that there
was such “vibhUti” list prevalent amongst the hindus.
