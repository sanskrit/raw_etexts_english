> As a Guru I get this one consistent question – “Why am I not
> progressing in my sadhana? It has been years… etc etc” Sometime there
> are some specific roadblocks that they need help with. But in most
> cases the cause is simple.  
> People do not put in the hours needed. Sadhana is cost intensive of
> time. There is no way to evade this. Some people, because of good
> samaskaras, do better and move faster when they take up a practice.
> But the rest of us are shit out of luck and need to grind away. As one
> of my mentors told me and which I in turn repeat – “Ghisna padtha
> hain.” You have to grind away and be ground down in turn. There is NO
> escape from this reality.
>
> This is not welcome news to a generation that believes champagne
> spirituality is a real thing. Why do I need to be in the mud with the
> hoi polloi? Is there no rocket route? Nope.  
> Grind. Burn. Evolve.  
> Several people do what I call the Futile Dance. In the morning they
> are huffing and puffing in pranayama, chanting and pujaing and
> asanaing and rarely meditating. In the evening they are in asuric
> environments like Pubs and Parliament and all the shakti gains made
> during the day are frittered away. People want transformation – but
> they also want an assurance it will not involve change.  
> People are stupid and deluded.
>
> I get this. I really do. I even sympathize. But there is no help from
> me. You cannot do sadhana along with a frivolous social life and a
> thousand daily inputs of chitta pollution. “If we do not go to these
> parties and get togethers the family is upset and opposes sadhana.”
> Okay, if that is your choice. Just don’t whine to me that your sadhana
> is not giving results. It is giving results but you are pouring water
> in a container that you poke holes in also. Why not accept that this
> much is the best I can do and work from there? That is facing reality.
> It also spares me from listening to deluded bullshit.  
> Unless the hours are put in, and put in consistently, you won’t grow.
> This is not pleasant, but it is the bloody truth.
>
> The most dangerous trap is when a person gets remarkable experiences
> at the early stages and loses interest in sadhana when they taper off.
> These experiences come in cycles, peaks and plateaus, and one must
> keep going. “Nothing is working because I am not feeling anything” is
> ridiculous self- important puffery. Your perceptions are not sensitive
> enough to observe what is happening below the outer surface. That is
> why you need a guru. But if you are not doing the work that ability
> never develops…
>
> So how much time is ideal? I would say a minimum of three hours a day
> with no upper limit. Such people alone get somewhere. If you do one
> hour or forty minutes you barely flush out the contaminations of
> travel, people, environment and daily interactions. Some small segment
> of shakti may accrue. This is not at all a bad place to be in. It is
> still better than the other 97 percent of humanity. But you are not
> going to move fast. This sort of steadiness creates punya, creates
> good vaasana samskara and if you are very lucky and have the blessing
> of devata and guru kshetram it may even change your circumstances so
> that you can do more sadhana. But it is a holding operation mainly. No
> new karma is allowed to accrue. Just the backlog is worked out. If you
> seriously wish to grapple with lifetimes of conditioning and
> limitations, three hours a day is the minimum test of seriousness.
>
> Sadhana has to be a priority. For me it was always THE priority. I
> would let jobs go that I could not afford to let go because they
> interfered with my sadhana. I was always cranky like that and people
> thought I was insane. But somehow it all worked out each time because
> there is a Power that protects and provides for the dedicated
> sadhaka.  
> I do not recommend it. People like to say they trust the Divine alone
> but they always keep a route back to the world in their back pocket.
> If you do that then you will experience disasters.  
> But for the normal person living a normal life, sadhana has to be in
> the top three priorities of life on a daily basis. For most people it
> is somewhere in the top ten only. If there is a stressful situation,
> the first thing to stop is the daily practice. That is exactly what
> you must not do under any circumstances.
>
> You don’t find the time for sadhana. You make it.  
> If you can watch TV, be on Facebook and pub crawl you can find time
> for sadhana. The brutal question is – What are you willing to give up
> so that you can attain this? For most people the answer is – Nothing
> much. That won’t do.  
> You cannot expect exemptions will be made for you. Human embodiment
> comes with many limitations that have to be overcome and that needs
> time. Consistent practice over time. Don’t be a fool and try to trick
> your way out of this requirement. Until you are doing three hours a
> day don’t ask why you are not progressing rapidly. Those who do hit
> the magic number are normally amazed at how life resets itself to
> support sadhana.

> Sarvam Shivamayam!

Swami Brahmananda:In actual spiritual life we find that unless one
strives one’s utmost and one’s best,the Lord’s grace will not descend
upon us.
