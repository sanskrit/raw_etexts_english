On account of our fascination with the geometry of origami (albeit not
well-endowed in mathematical capacity) we discovered for ourselves
shortly after our father had taught us trigonometry that,  
![\\arctan(1)+\\arctan(2)+\\arctan(3)=\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%281%29%2B%5Carctan%282%29%2B%5Carctan%283%29%3D%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arctan(1)+\\arctan(2)+\\arctan(3)=\\pi")  
We had earlier shown the [origami proof for
that](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/some-reminiscences-of-our-study-of-chaotic-maps-2/).
But it was only a little later while drifting away from one of those
trigonometric identities that you routinely faced in those annoying
college exams we stumbled upon a beautiful relationship that was
apparently first discovered by the great Leonhard Euler. This is a
relationship parallel to the above one:  
![\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(1\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft%281%5Cright%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(1\\right)=\\frac{\\pi}{4}")  
The proof for this, like the origami proof for the above, can be
achieved from a self-evident construction of Euler — what the Hindus of
yore would have called an upapatti or mathematicians today term
“wordless” proof. It is illustrated below but I add several words for
the benefit of the non-geometrically oriented reader.

1\) Draw square ABCD and triplicate it so that the three squares share a
side.  
2\) Draw diagonals AC and CG of first two squares and use them to draw
square ACGF and duplicate it.  
3\) Draw
![\\overline{AE}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAE%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AE}"): from the construction it is apparent that ![\\angle
GAE=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+GAE%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle GAE=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)")  
4\) From the construction it is clear that ![\\angle
EAC=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+EAC%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle EAC=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)")  
5\) We thus see: ![\\angle GAE+ \\angle EAC = \\angle BAC=
\\frac{\\pi}{4}=
\\arctan(1)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+GAE%2B+%5Cangle+EAC+%3D+%5Cangle+BAC%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B4%7D%3D+%5Carctan%281%29%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle GAE+ \\angle EAC = \\angle BAC= \\frac{\\pi}{4}= \\arctan(1)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)")

This relationship is one of a class of strange trigonometric
relationships that interestingly bring in the meru-średhī (called in
western literature as Fibonacci sequence):

![\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{M\_{2n}}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{M\_{2n+1}}\\right)+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{M\_{2n+2}}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BM_%7B2n%7D%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BM_%7B2n%2B1%7D%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5Carctan%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BM_%7B2n%2B2%7D%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{M_{2n}}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{M_{2n+1}}\\right)+\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{M_{2n+2}}\\right)")

![M=1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%3D1%2C1%2C2%2C3%2C5%2C8%2C13%2C21...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M=1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21..."), the meru-średhī; thus for
![n=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1"), we get ![M\_2=1; M\_3=2;
M\_4=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_2%3D1%3B+M_3%3D2%3B+M_4%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_2=1; M_3=2; M_4=3").  
This leads us to a formula for
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi") based on the odd terms of meru-średhī starting from
![M\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_3"):

![\\pi=4\\displaystyle \\sum\_{n=1}^\\infty \\arctan
\\left(\\frac{1}{M\_{2n+1}}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D4%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Carctan+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BM_%7B2n%2B1%7D%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi=4\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\arctan \\left(\\frac{1}{M_{2n+1}}\\right)")

Shown below is the convergence of the above series to
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi"): We reach an accuracy of 6 decimal places for
![n=18](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D18&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=18").
