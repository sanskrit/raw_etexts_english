“And so these men of Indostan  
Disputed loud and long,  
Each in his own opinion  
Exceeding stiff and strong.  
Though each was partly right,  
All were in the wrong.”

Thus, as John Saxe had elegantly stated, most people debate about the
Middle East. For those who believe they have seen the elephant itself, a
very important test for several geopolitical scenarios in the coming
years is going to be the conflict between Moslem Iran and the Jews (not
Americans). Ultimately, any one with common sense knows that Israel is
the strongest of the Middle Eastern states. For all their talk the Arabs
are pretty useless in war. The Americans easily defeated them in the
invasion of Iraq, but committed the fatal mistake of trying to occupy
them in the modern world. Israel has also learned the hard way that
occupation of Arab territory is not at all an effective strategy in the
long term. Anyhow, Israel has effectively neutralized the Arab threat to
its \*existence\* unless it commits demographic suicide (Like Hindus
might in India). But Iran is another claimant for the position of
hegemon of the ME, though it is far from actually going nuclear. So a
conflict between the Jews and Iran is almost inevitable and both sides
know this fully well, and are taking steps. The Jewish action so far is
subtle and covert, while Iran has been loud and open. Yet, I suspect
this loudness of Iran is not really comparable to the Arab loudness
(like that of Saddam; the Arabs got the take home message with his
recent lynching). Iran probed Israel using the Hezbollah, which was the
first sign that they might actually have a sting to back the claws. Is
Israel going ever respond with an attack like that on Osirak? This is a
very interesting point to get an answer on. But our feeling is that the
Jewish strategy is going to be different this time. I believe it is
important for Hindus to observe this carefully, especially given that
Israel is a notable arms supplier for India and has cooperated in some
areas of military intelligence.
