<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Govind<span class="char-style-override-8"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Govardhan is a very attractive village. The most of the inhabitants of the village are Brahmans, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. There is a temple, in the midst of the village. A very beautiful idol of Lord Shrinathji Maharaj exists in the temple. In His feet there is anklet, the pleasant wild garland is there in His neck, and His head is adorned with peacock-feather crown. His hair are curly, the figure of his eyes is very entrancing and He is in the yellow garment. In the idol there is such a charm that who see it, are ever unsatisfied. Near the temple there was the house of a poor Brahman. Though the Brahman was poor, but he was fully soaked in the devotion of the Lord. The Brahman’s wife also remained absorbed in the Love of her husband’s Supreme Lord as well as her husband. She was of very simple and sociable nature. None ever heard any harsh word from her mouth. The nature of the son is shaped according to the nature of the parents usually. Justifiably the Brahman couple’s son, Govind was also of very good nature. He was ten years old. The body constitution of Govind was so charming that the people even call him the incarnation of Cupid.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Govind used to play with his companions Sadanand and Ramdas on the outskirt of the village. One day, while playing, the evening set in. Govind was returning home. He heard the hymns recited in adoration of God in the temple. Govinda was also attracted to go and see the spectacle in the temple when he heard the sound of conch shell, bell, gong and gingling sistrum and just the moment, running he reached the temple to see the waving of light in adoration of God (Nathji). Seeing His view, the child’s mind got engrossed. Govind failed to understand that it was merely a stone-idol. He saw apparently that a live very pleasant lad is smiling. Govind was charmed by the pleasant smile of Nathji. He thought, ‘If this boy becomes my friend and play with me, it would be of great pleasure for me. In the meanwhile the waving of light of God ended. All people left for their respective homes. The priest also went locking the doors of the temple. Only Govind was standing outside of the temple waiting for Nathji, in the darkness. When Govind became confident that none was there after watching all around, peeping through the hole of the gate inside, calling fondly in the choked voice from the deep core of the heart, he said—‘Nathji! <span class="char-style-override-5">b</span>rother! Will you not play withe me? I am feeling excessive impatient to play with You. Brother! <span class="char-style-override-5">c</span>ome out and just see! What a fine and pleasant the moon-lit night is! Let us play tip-cat. I tell You the truth, brother! I will never quarrel or fight with you.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The soft-hearted boy became intoxicated by the impact of feeling of the time when the recitation in the adoration of the God was going on. Being overwhelmed by nectarial fragrant of Malaya mountain air-current of the Supreme Lord’s sweet and eternal love, Govind began to call Govind, the devotee’s heart, weeping. The tearful words of the child worked. </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Gita 4/11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Arjun, however, men seek Me, even so do I approach them.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to His promise, Nathji could not stay in the temple. The devotee’s emotion of deep love attracted the Lord. Govind heard, as if the inner voice—“Brother! All right, I do come, both of us will play.” </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The simple-hearted child’s sweet love attracts the Lord instantly. For the sake of child Dhruva, the Lord had to go to the forest in the four-armed form. He assumed the unique Narsingh form for the sake of devotee Prahlad He wandered about from forest to forest grazing the cows with the boys of Braj. Hearing the mad with love call of Govind, He came out of the temple to play with him. O the gracious Lord! It is not known how many sports you perform engrossed in Maya? Who could know Your mystery? People fall into illusion by the common illusory but You are chief of the mystics. The Divine Maya is the female attendant of your lotus feet fondled by bee-devotees, so who can know the mystery of Your play? It is true that You like the most to play with Your devotees. So You had roamed about with Dhanna, milking the cows and that is why You became ready at once, at the call of Govind to play with him today.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Smiling Nathji came and stood near Govind, Govind caught hold of His hand with a great love. Today, Govind’s joys have no bounds, sometimes he gets intoxicated to see His Lotus face, sometimes he feels himself blessed to touch His Lotus-hands. Sometimes he is charmed to see His pointed eyes, and sometimes he becomes fond of hearing His melodious words. Govind is overjoyed beyond part of His beauty limit. It is doubtless so the case. The entire charm of the universe is part of His infinitesimal beauty. Who is there anyone to remain unenchanted by the charm of that infinite and boundless beauty in sight? </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Govind came out of his village with that friend. It was the moon-lit night in full bloom, there was the cluster of lotus blossoming in the pond by getting the union of the beloved. The scattering tordy fragrance of the half pettled flower buds had made the forest pleasant as if the well-decorated nature were already prepared to offer a handful of flowers to greet the Lord—Nathji. In such a pleasant night Govind was oblivious of his home, parents, sleep and hunger in the company of Nathji. Both the friends began to play different games very affectionately.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Govind had said that he would not quarrel or fight; but he forgot it being allured by the charm of jovial Nathji. While playing, both the friends quarreled on any triffling matter. In anger, Govind gave a slap on the cheek of Nathji and said—‘If you tease me ever in future, mind it, I will thrash you badly.’ Afraid of the same Lord of the three worlds, the sun-moon and fire-wind remain duty-bound, even the king of gods—Lord Indra is bound to rain timely, and the Lord of death—Yamraj remains busy in frightening the sinners, does not speak even after having been slapped by a small child devotee while playing. Blessings on you!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nathji began to weep and said—‘Brother Govind! You had made a promise not to beat Me, then, why did you beat Me?’ Hearing these words of Nathji and to see Him weeping, Govind’s heart melted. He rushed and wiped off His tears, embraced Him and said—‘Brother! Don’t weep, my heart bursts out to see tears in your eyes, You are dearest to me.’ Both began to play again. It got late in the night. Thinking that his parents would be worried,  Govind felt to go home. By Nathji’s illusive power Govind said—‘Nathji! It is too late, I go home, let us play tomorrow again.’ Nathji agreed. Govind went to his home. The sole protector of those—the shelter-seeking, Shri Nathji went back to the temple.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Daily, they began to play in this way. Govind forgot his both the old friends getting charming Manmohan, as a new friend. One day, Shri Nathji ran away not to give the chance to Govind while playing. Govind, too, ran after Him. Nathji entered the temple. The gate of the temple was closed, so Govind could not enter. He began to decry Him being annoyed in love, considering it His injustice. The king of Rinwa Raghuraj Singhji, the composer of ‘Bhaktmal’ writes—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">भागि मंदिर भीतर कृष्ण गए, </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तब गोविन्द भीतर जान लगो।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जब पंडन मारि निकासि दियो, </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तब बाहर ही अति कोप जगो॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">महि ठोंकत डंड, प्रचारत गारि दे, </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तू कढ़िहैं कबलों न भगो।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">इत बैठे रहौंगो मैं तेरे लिये, </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नहि दाँव दियो अहै पूरो ठगो॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Krishna entered in the temple running, then Govind also began to go inside after Him. When the priests ousted him by beating, Govind got agitated outside the temple. Beating the stick on the ground and scolding Him he said—‘You may do anything but I am not going to run away. I will remain sitting here for Your sake, till You give me the chance. You seem to be complete cheater.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Soon after the temple opened, Govind entered there and beating the idol of Nathji with stick, he said—‘Will You run away again?’ The priest caught Govind saying—‘Fie! fie!’ and turned him out of the temple beating him. His love-fury added more and he began to say—‘Nathji! You have done a great injustice to me; first without giving me chance You ran to come here and now, You have got me turned out after beating me through <span class="char-style-override-5">y</span>our men, well! I will see tomorrow, I will not even drink the water till I return it in the same coin.’ Saying so, Govind went duly displeased and sat on the <span class="char-style-override-5">g</span>ovindkund. On the other side offering of food to the deity was ready in the temple. The priest was given the counter command—‘I cannot accept this offering of food till My devotee whom all of you have turned out beating him, comes back. The blow on his body, has been afflicted on My body.’ How the priest will know that God and God’s devotee is not distinct but integral? However, the priest got very much perturbed and ran in his search and after a great effort, getting Govind on the <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>und began to say—‘Brother! <span class="char-style-override-5">f</span>ollow me, Nathji has called you, He accepts His defeat before you and promises to play with you again.’ Hearing the words of the Brahman, Govind said—‘I didn’t like to go at all; it is He to come to me and when I would have beaten <span class="char-style-override-5">h</span>im badly, He would come to his senses, but, since He has accepted His defeat, I do follow you.’ Saying so Govind went to the temple and said laughing being proud of his victory—‘Why, Nathji! Will You commit such a cunningness again? It was well and good that You called me accepting Your defeat, otherwise You would have remembered throughout Your life how I would have treated You.’ Govind did say all these words but when he saw the face of Nathji sad, his simple heart felt agonised very much. He said—‘Brother! Why did You not accept the offering till now? Seeing Your face dejected my innerself weeps. I will never beat <span class="char-style-override-5">y</span>ou again, Your displeasure is unbearable to me. I will never be annoyed with You; kindly, agree and accept the offering.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The doors of the temple were closed. Nathji manifested Himself and said—‘Brother! You are also hungry—Let us eat together jointly.’ Seeing the pleasing face of Nathji, the Lotus like heart of Govind came to blossom. Both began to laugh. The whole temple resounded with joy. Govind was under the sway of Lord Govind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All of a sudden, the door opened, Govind attained the divine sight and to him all around Nathji alone was visible.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Mohan<span class="char-style-override-8"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There lived a Brahman widow in a small village. The Brahmani was penniless, she had none to call her own except her small son. She along with her son lived from hand to mouth with whatever she got by begging from a very few houses. Some days she got a very little begging, then, remaining herself hungry giving her son something to eat, she used to sleep clinging him to her bosom being contented. In the village, there were many well-off people; but none cared for this poor helpless  Brahmani. The rich persons living in the palaces suffer from dyspepsia by overeating so many different items of dish unsuitable to health, and the food also does not digest to them but why should they have any care for the poor or destitutes? It is not known how many poor and helpless die of starvation pining for in the country, but who looks to their plight? But the God is the protector of those who have none. That God—all nourishing anyhow, certainly makes available some food grain to satisfy the appetite even in the shatterd hut of the poor.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman lady’s son became six years old. Being a Brahman son, he must study something, but how to educate? In the eyes of most of the inhabitants of the village on account of being poor, that Brahman lady was despicable. The Brahman lady managed for Mohan’s education in a school of another village. One day, going to the Guru of the other village with her son, she began to weep. The Guru felt pity. He accepted the child to teach him. Mohan began to go to study. Her village was four miles away from the school, but what was the source of conveyance? Mohan used to go and come on foot. Although, those days, it was the custom for the pupils to stay at the houses of the Gurus but on account of being of tender age, neither he wanted to stay at Guru’s house nor the mother, herself, could sleep peacefully without hiding her only son under her saree. On the way there was a desolate forest for a short distance, Mohan has to pass through it. At the sun-rise he used to go and when he returned in the evening it became dark. So, Mohan remained fearful while passing through the forest.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, there was some festival at the Guru’s home. Mohan was late to come back therefrom. Due to first fortnight of the month, the darkness in the forest was much more. Mohan was much afraid on the way, he began to tremble hearing the sound of the wild animals, jackals. The Brahmani also went in his search because of getting late. Taking the fearing and trembling son into her lap she came back home. After some time in peaceful mood, Mohan said to his mother—‘Mother! I have to pass daily through the forest, I feel afriad there. If you had not reached today, God knows what would had happend to me. For other boys, servants are there to take care of them, will you not appoint any servant for me?’ Hearing the innocent words of the child, the mother’s eyes got full with tears just considering her own poor condition. The Brahman lady tried to keep patience, but she could not control any longer. Weeping she began to say—‘Son! How to express my wretched condition before you, we are really, very poor, where is money with me to appoint any servant for you?’ Seeing tears in his mother’s eyes, Mohan also began to weep, He said—‘Mother! Why do you weep? To see you weeping, I also fail to control myself from weeping, Mother! Is there none of us?’ The lady Brahman’s heart became heavy with distress by the heart-touching innocent question of Mohan, as if the earth began to slip out of her feet, the patience began to break down but it came to her mind that the God is shelterer of the orphans, is He not ours? Just coming it to her memory, the Brahman lady’s heart became strong, the tears of her eyes disappeared suddenly, she began to say, ‘Son! <span class="char-style-override-5">w</span>hy not, Gopal is our own kith and kin. The child asked, ‘Mother! What is my relation to Gopal?’ The words escaped from the affectionate Brahmani’s lips; ‘Son! Gopal Bhai is your elder brother.’ The child said—‘Mother! Where does he live? I have yet not seen Him.’ The Brahmani’s heart was now overwhelmed by Divine Love. When the person, being disappointed from all the sides depending completely on Lord’s shelter looks only towards Him, gets the assurance and shelter from His side. Just getting that imperceptible shelter, the power, wisdom, glow and knowledge begins to develop in his heart in natural way. The heart is filled with the love of God. The <span class="char-style-override-5">B</span>rahman lady began to say having no doubt in heart—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Son! Our Gopal is omnipresent, everywhere, on water, on plain, ground, in fire, in space, in down world, fruits, flowers, ocean, river, etc.,—He dwells everywhere. There is no place in the universe where He is not present. But He is not visible easily. When anyone feels afflicted excessively to see Him, He is visible only then. Once, He had been apparently seen to the cowherd maidens of Vrindavan on their affliction. Once, He was visioned by five years old boy Dhruv. One who gets His vision once, is charmed by His beauty and His disposition forever?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mohan—‘Mother! My Gopal Bhai never comes to our house.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman lady—‘Why not does He come? He always dwells here.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mohan—‘Have you ever seen Him?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman lady—‘No, I have not seen Him. I never had longing for Him. But I know that He blesses with His vision on yearning.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mohan—‘Then, why don’t you yearn for Him? How do you control yourself to live without seeing such a good natured and charming appearance? Mother! I cannot live without seeing Him. Tell me, how to yearn for Him?’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman lady—‘Son! Just you become restless for food when you are hungry, when you are thirsty you cry for water, as you were restless in the forest to get me today, similarly, if you restlessly call Him, He is sure to come. That day, I had related you a story, is’nt it? Did you forget it? When Duhshasan began to unclothe Draupadi in the open assembly, being very much distressed, she had called Him; my Gopal had reached there just hearing her call.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mohan—‘Is he my Gopal Bhai?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman lady—‘Yes, my son! it is He the same Gopal. When called, then and there He comes and removes all the sufferings.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mohan—‘Then, mother! what should I do? How to call Him?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman lady said with firm conviction—‘Listen! The forest, which you are passing through, your Gopal Bhai lives in that forest. You may call Him whole-heartedly, He will come and accompany you when He hears your call.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The simple and obedient child, looking far and behind called while entering the forest; ‘Brother! gopal Bhai!! Where are You? kindly, come, I feel fearful.’ The child heard as if someone is saying, ‘yes, I am here, reaching in no time!’ Hearing the melodious voice, the child became confident, his fear had gone, after going just a while he saw that a small cowherd child of his same age, charming to the eyes, delicate Shyamsunder coming out in forest began to play with him talking affectionately with Him, and holding his hands began to accompany him. Mohan got rid of his all sorrows just at the reaching of Gopal. Reaching his house, Mohan narrated the entire story to his mother. The Brahman lady began to weep considering it the Lord’s grace. She thought, If the kind hearted Lord, who had blessed Dhruv with His vision hearing his call, would have come to hear my child’s call, then, what is to be amazed?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After some days, his Guru’s father died, the Shraddh ceremony was organised. For this purpose, all the student would gift something to the Guruji. The Brahman lady’s son, Mohan also asked Guruji—‘Guruji! What is your order for me? What should I bring?’ The Guru Maharaj was acquainted with the poverty of the Brahman lady. He said—‘Son! You have to bring nothing.’ He said—‘No, Guruji! If all the students will bring something or the other, then, order me also to share.’ On the insistence of the child again and again Guruji Maharaj said—‘You may bring a potful of milk.’ Being satisfied Mohan went away home. He said to his mother—‘Mother! Tomorrow is the final day of Shraddh offering of Guruji’s father. All the students will fetch something. Guruji has asked me to bring one potful of milk only; so, purchase some milk.’ The Brahman lady was quite poor. Ashwathama’s mother had also to mix flour in water in place of milk to satisfy her son to console him one day. The Brahman lady said—‘There is not even a single penny in our house, where will I get milk from? There is not even a small pot in the house to beg for milk in it.’ Weeping Mohan said—‘Mother! What to do? How will I face Guruji?’ The mother said with confidence—‘Son! Ask to Gopal Bhaiji. If He so wishes, He will manage the milk certainly.’ The boy became happy. In the morning, while going to the Guruji’s house, as usual as soon as Gopal Bhai met him in the forest, Mohan said—‘Brother! Today is the Shraddh offering of my Guruji’s father, he has asked for a potful of milk, My mother has aksed me to tell to Gopal Bhai, and He will arrange milk.’ Gopal said very affectionately—‘Brother! <span class="char-style-override-5">i</span>t is already known to me, just see! I have brought, the full pot of milk, you take it.’ Mohan took the pot of milk from Gopal. His joys knew no bound today, who does not feel delighted on his fulfilment? A child gets the same joy to get a simple toy what a king, thirsty of kingdom, gets to get a kingdom of his desire. Really, both are the toys. The real joy is neither in the kingdom nor in the simple toy, that is within ourselves, which flashes like lightning in the mind once, when the ambition is fulfilled and goes on twinkling till the next ambition is cropped up. But here, in getting the milk given by Gopal, there was somewhat unique, happiness. The form of this joy is known to the blessed one only who has attained it by Divine grace. It is beyond our imagination. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Smiling Mohan reached Guruji with the small pot of milk. The servants of Guruji were keeping the objects brought by the students separately after showing them to Guruji. The boy thought that there would be the turn of his milk also but nobody paid any attention to that small pot of milk. Being sad the child said to the Guruji—‘Maharaj! I have also brought the milk.’ Guruji was surveying the big items. He gave no answer to the child. It is only the Lord, hungry of love, knows the value of the gift offered by the poors much lovingly and with devotion. So, it is only He prizes it. Sudama’s handful of broken rice, the jujube tree fruit of untouchable lower caste Shabari, the Khichari of Karama and the vegetables of roots offered by Vidura, had the special liking for the Lord, which could be felt by Him only, that is why He had eaten it with great joviality and great pleasure and that is why He declared—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पत्रं पुष्पं फलं तोयं यो मे भक्त्या प्रयच्छति।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तदहं भक्त्युपहृतमश्नामि प्रयतात्मन:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Whosoever offer Me with love a leaf, flower, fruit, water etc., I appear in person before that disinterested devotee of sinless mind, and delightfully partake of that article offered by him with love.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is no importance of the quantity of objects, there is value of love; The Kauravas had left no stone unturned in the reception of Lord Shri Krishna but the Lord said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सम्प्रीतिभोज्यान्यन्नानि आपद्भोज्यानि वा पुन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">न च सम्प्रीयसे राजन् न चैवापद्‍गता वयम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The food is taken where there is love or on the fall of calamity it is taken anywhere to anyone. Here, you lack in love and I am not in distress. So, I will not accept your meal.’ Alright!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Mohan said repeatedly, the Guruji disregardingly, being irritated said to his servant—‘How much hue and cry is this boy creating for a little object of gift?’ As if he had fulfilled me. Take the milk in any pot and get rid of his hue and cry soon.’ The shadow of sadness surfaced on the face of the child due to his insult. The poor boy was helpless! He began to weep.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The prank of the Lord is strange; What He wants to do and what means He applies, is beyond anyone’s knowledge. The servant poured down the milk in a bowl, the bowl got filled but the pot was not empty; he lifted an other glass, that also filled up, but the milk was not exhausted; at last, he started pouring down the milk into a bucket, the small pot was not empty. Then, being perturbed, the servant went to Guruji and told him all about it. Many learned <span class="char-style-override-5">B</span>rahmans had gathered for the purpose of Shraddh ceremony, hearing this astonishing matter, all came there hurriedly. They see that the milk is full in a small pot, just near, the milk is upto the mouth of the bucket and other pots. Guruji said—‘Pour down before me just.’ The servant started pouring down the milk into an other pot. The pot got filled up, but small pot did not go empty. Again an other bigger pot was placed there, that was also filled up in no time. The milk became as if Draupadi’s Sari—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">डारत-डारत कर थक्यो चुक्यो न लुटिया-दूध॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Pouring down the milk, the hands got tired but the milk of the small pot could not be emptied.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, the amazement of the Guru Maharaj and the Brahmans was beyond imagination. The Guru asked—‘Son! <span class="char-style-override-5">w</span>here had you brought this milk from?’ The child answered modestly—‘My Gopal Bhai lives in the forest, it is He who had given me.’ The Guru enquired—‘Child! <span class="char-style-override-5">w</span>ho is Gopal Bhai?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mohan said—‘He is my brother. My mother had said, ‘You can demand of Him whatever you want, He is Lord of the humbles—He purifies the down-troddens. He owns the afflicted ones. He is the supporter of supportless. He comes when one cries piteously. He provides whatever you want.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of the child, Guruji was moved. He clasped him to his heart having lifted him, just a moment before he was hateful, the same became very much affectionate. One whom the Lord owns, is owned by all.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गरल सुधा रिपु करहिं मिताई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गोपद सिंधु अनल सितलाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The opponents even become friends and the poison changes into nectar. The ocean becomes like a cow-hoof and the fire becomes cool.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The group of the Brahmans sat down to partake of meals. Today, ‘Khir’ (the rice mixed with sugar and milk) had been prepared with the milk brought by Mohan. The taste of the sweet rice with milk was unique. Why not! The Lord Brahma and other gods always remain eager of tasting a single particle of that unavailable offering, was today available as the item of food on the occasion of the Shraddh offering. The Brahmans did not get satiated, while partaking of it, but they got fulfilled for ever by attaining the divine abode, even rarely obtainable by gods and sages by virtue of Mahaprasad. What was strange if their manes got emancipation?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having blessed the child affectionately from the core and corner of their heart, the group of the Brahmans returned back. At last, the Gurudev took the food along with all his students. Mohan, also, had to take his meal there. Evening set in and all the students went to their respective houses. The Gurudevji detained Mohan, the dearest of Gopal Bhai. When all departed, he said to him—‘Son! I just accompany you, you have to reveal me also the vision of your Gopal Bhai.’ Mohan said—‘Well! Accompany me right now to the forest. My Gopal Bhai comes just on a call.’ The Guru lifted the child in his lap and both reached the forest. Just reaching there the child called—‘Gopal Bhai! Come on, why do you take so much time today?’ In return he heard, ‘Today you are not alone, then, why do you call Me? Mohan said, ‘Brother! My Guruji wants to see you, come soon.’ The Lord cannot stay even for a moment hearing the loving call of His devotee. The noble blue coloured Shyamsunder appeared. The child said—‘My brother has come. Gurudev! See, how charming my Gopal Bhai is!’ Gurudev could see nothing except an amazing illumination, he said—‘Where is He? I don’t see anything else except this illumination.’ The child said—‘What is this matter? Gopal Bhai! What play are you playing today?’ The answer came—‘Brother! I come to you because your innerself is pure, that is full of love. Your spiritual discipline is accomplished, but your Gurudevji, yet, not worthy of My sight. What illumination, he has seen, is quite enough for him. He can tread on the beneficial path by this much only.’ The Gurudev also heard this melodious speech. The closed door of his heart opened, the illusion of his mind was removed. He was overwhelmed with the ocean of love. Gurudev said with choked voice—‘Lord! Your divine light removed the darkness of my heart and Your speech gave me the glimpse of Your divine abode. Now, I see You in my heart. Lord! This is my earnest desire to let my this state last forever.’ Mohan was smiling being overjoyed. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After a shortwhile, the Gurudev was also graced. Gurudev Maharaj felt fulfilled for ever to see the appearance of the Lord, the ocean of kindness, the treasure of beauty, the store of love, the most liberal and of outstanding glowing appearance.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The Gurudev came to the Brahman lady along with Mohan. What he sees there—as if sitting in the lap the mother there, ‘Gopal Bhai’ is sucking the nectar of love of the mother. The mother is unaware of outer world. The entire body of Gopal Bhai is drenched by the constant flow of the joyous tears of the mother. The Guru and pupil both plunged into the sea of bliss to see this sight.*</p>
<p class="Footnotes para-style-override-4">* Swami Shri Vivekanandji had heard a story from his nurse in his childhood. The pupil of Swamiji, M.C. Fainki writes—this fable had the greatest impact on his life. This fable has been written on the basis of that story.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Dhanna Jat<span class="char-style-override-8"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All human beings of all castes can cultivate devotion towards god. If the river-flow of their mental disposition starts flowing towards the blissful ocean of the Lord, are fit for Devotion and the Lord, the lover of devotees, is pleased with them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee Dhannaji was a jat by caste. He had not studied, he had not even been able to hear the Shastras also; but his simple and soft heart was full of love. There is none in the world, who does not have the seed of love in his heart, the only thing is lacking of watering it with the nectarine flow of the association of saintly persons, that is why the seed does not germinate, and if anyhow it germinates, It perishes long before providing comfort to the world by means of bearing leaves, flowers and fruits as it does not flourish due to unfavourable environment. If constant watering with the nectar of Satsang continues, if the air of Lord’s name is favourable and remains protected by the shadow of firm faith and conviction, a day will come when growing to be a big and broad eternal tree, it can give contentment and pleasure to the entire world by its fragrance and sweet nectarine fruits.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The great saint Dhannaji’s seed of love had already got the vitality to sprout by the nectarine association of the saints in his very childhood. Dhannaji’s father was a farmer. In spite of being uneducated, his heart was simple and full of devotion. He always use to serve saints, Sadhus and God-devotees according to his capacity. Those days like today, there was neither the prevalence of the disease of excess intelluctualism, nor there was any burden of hypocrite austeres on the pious land of India. So, there was no more hindrance in the simple service of the Sadhus. Reputed saints and Sadhus used to visit Dhannaji’s father also. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dhannaji was five years old then. One day, a God-devotee Brahman visited his house. The Brahman bathed drawing water from the well with his own hands, then after, having finished his daily routine of worship and prayer etc., taking out the idol of Shalikgramji, he got it bathed and worshipped with the holy basil leaves, sandal, incense stick and lamp. After offering Bhog to the Lord, he, himself, took meal. Dhannaji was watching all this activities of the Brahman with curiosity. The child was simple-hearted. He got the company of the saints for sometime. Dhanna also desired that if he, also, had the idol of the Lord, he would have worshipped in the same way. The children immitate the actions of the elders and want to do in the same way. Going to the Brahman, Dhanna said in sweet and pleasant natural words—‘Panditji! If you give me an idol of the Lord just like you have, I would also worship the Lord like you.’ First the Brahman paid no heed, but when the boy, Dhanna made him restless by imploring humbly and weeping again and again, he gave him a black stone piece to avoid the trouble and said—‘Son! He is your God; go on worshipping Him.’ Dhanna, as if, got initiation as a disciple. In a very short period of the association with the saints and by the power of the Lord’s devotion, the child, Dhanna pleased the God very soon. The glory of the association with the saints is uttered by the Lord, Shri Krishna Himself to Uddhavji—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">The glorious Lord began again:</span> Neither Yoga (consisting of eight limbs enumerated in the Yoga-Sutras of Patanjali) nor Sankhya (knowledge of the distinctive character of the different categories discussed in the Sankhya system of philosophy) nor righteousness consisting of non-violence, benevolence etc., study of the Vedas or Japa of the Divine Name, austerity and renunciation nor pouring oblations into the sacred fire and works of public utility such as the digging of wells and tanks and the laying out of gardens nor the bestowal of gifts, observing fasts, worship of gods, muttering secret spells, resorting to holy waters and places of pilgrimage, undertaking sacred observances such as purity of body and mind and the five forms of self-abnegation (non-violence etc.,) gain Me over as does Satsanga capture Me—Satsanga, which actually puts an end to all other attachments.  For, thanks to the fellowship of saints, a number of Daityas (the sons of Diti), Yatudhanas (ogres), beasts and birds, Gandharvas and Apsaras, Nagas, Siddhas, Caranas and Guhyakas (Yaksas), Vidyadharas, and among human beings even Vaisyas and Sudras, womenfolk and the lowest born, possessed of a Rajasika and Tamasika disposition, such as Vrtrasura (son of the god Twasta through a Daitya mother), Prahrada (son of Kayadhu), Vrsaparva, Bali, Bana, Maya and Vibhisana, sub-human beings like Sugriva, Hanuman, Jambavan (a bear), the celebrated elephant of the legend Jatayu, a vulture, Tuladhara, a merchant, Dharmavyadha (a hunter by profession), Kubja (a hunch-backed damsel), the Gopis, cowherdesses, as well as the wives of Brahmanas (engaged in performing a sacrifice) of Vraja and others ascended to My realm in different Yugas, O sinless Uddhava ! Although they had never studied the Sruti texts, had never waited upon the most exalted ones (for the said purpose), had not observed any sacred vows nor practised any austerities, they nevertheless attained to Me through the fellowship of saints alone. Through mere love indeed the cowherdesses and cows, nay, trees and antelopes, cobras and other dull-witted creatures accomplished the object of their life and easily attained to Me, whom one cannot reach even with great exertion through Yoga or Sankhya, liberality, sacred vows, austerities and sacrificial performances, exposition of sacred texts, study of the Vedas, or Japa of the Divine Name and renunciation.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Therefore, turning your back upon injunctions as well as upon interdictions, nay, renouncing worldly activity as well as cessation from activity, and rejecting that which has been learnt and that which has yet to be learnt, O Uddhava, seek as your refuge Me alone, the one Self of all embodied creatures, with all your being; for with Me alone, as your Master, you can be rid of fear from all quarters.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Child Dhanna’s bliss knew no bounds, he sometimes keeps his Lord on his head and sometimes he moves about clinging the Lord to his bosom. The bound of Dhanna’s worship increased. Dhanna gave up all games and sports, he began to take bath getting up before the advent of morning. Then after getting the Lord bathed, Dhannaji used to bring fresh soil in place of sandal and put the mark (Tilak) on the Lord’s forehead with it. In the absence of basil leaf, he offered green leaf of any tree to the Lord. He used to adore the Lord with great devotion and offering prostration to the Lord lying down flat on the ground. When the mother gave him the bread of Millet to eat, Dhannaji, putting the bread before the Lord, used to close his eyes. In between, he opened the eyes to see whether the Lord had started to partake of it or not and again closed his eyes for sometime. Thus, when a enough time passed, he used to see that the Lord had not partaken of the bread till then and he felt very sad and he made earnest request again and again with folded hands in sweet words in the natural child-like simple way. When he saw that even then, the Lord had not eaten, being disappointed thinking that the Lord was displeased with him, that is why, He did not accept his worship and offering, but how was it possible that God should remain hungry and he would eat? Thinking so he used to throw the bread in the forest and remained hungry himself. The next day also he did the same. Thus, when many days passed without food and water; Dhannaji’s energy was lost to a great extent his body withered, he had no strength even to move. He was not so much worried of his own bodily tormentation as much he was worried why Thakurji did not eat his bread. On account of this poignant agony, The tears streamed forth from his eyes constantly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, the Lord’s seat was shaken. It was a very hard test of the child. Being melted by the sorrow of the devotee, the Lord appeared. <span class="char-style-override-12">‘अशब्दमस्पर्शमरूपमव्ययम्’</span> That Supreme Lord—Sachidanandghan who is unattainable even by Yoga, trance and steadfastness in knowledge, appeared before His devotee in the form of an outstanding charming image by virtue of Dhanna’s love and began to eat the bread of that <span class="char-style-override-12">‘प्रयतात्मन:’</span><span class="char-style-override-13"> </span>‘selfless loving devotee’ <span class="char-style-override-12">‘भक्त्युपहृतम्’</span><span class="char-style-override-14"> </span> offered with great love. When He finished half loaf of the bread, the highly blessed Dhanna caught His hands and began to say—‘Thakurji! You did not come for so many days, You made me to starve, and today when You came, You began to eat the full loaf of bread alone. If You eat the entire, then, I will starve even today, will You not give me the least?’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord smiled to hear the simple and pleasant words of the child devotee and He gave the remaining bread to Dhanna. Today the taste of Dhanna’s bread, better than nectar, is beyond the description even by Shesh-Sharada. The affectionate to His devotees, the kind-hearted jester Lord began to charm Dhanna’s mind appearing daily in the same way by His charming look enchanting the minds of people. The man can control his mind only till he did not glance this unique form of the Lord, anyone who is fortunate to take only a single glance of this wonderful appearance of the Lord only once, loses his mind and heart out of his control forever and then, nothing of the worldly objects can please him even for a moment except His beautiful appearance—nothing suits to his mind. The same was the condition of Dhannaji. If he didn’t get the look of Manmohan even for a moment or he failed to see Him in his mind, he used to faint at the very moment and fell down on the ground. The Lord’s separation of a moment even was unbearable to him. That is why the Lord had to remain in his heart or with him always. Dhanna tied the Lord with the bond of his love, that is why, the entire wealth of a devotee, the Lord also could not separate Dhanna even for a moment. This was already the promise of the Lord—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">ये मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘One who sees Me present in all beings, and all the beings in Me, never loses to Me, nor do I ever lose of him.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dhannaji became somewhat grown up, so the mother assigned him the task of milking the cows also. There were many cows. Dhannaji used to milk the cows both the times. One day, the Lord manifesting said—‘Brother! You must be feeling troublesome in milking so many cows. I will milk your cows.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Adored by the gods, sages and worthy of service by all the moving and non-moving beings, and Supreme Lord of the universe, the Lord began to serve His devotee, living with His child devotee. How blessed! Dhanna’s joy is beyond limit. He is enjoying inconceivable, matchless bliss living in the company of Supreme bliss incarnate Lord. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After a few days, Dhanna’s Guru, the same Brahman visited Dhanna’s house again and enquired—Do you worship the Lord or not?’ Smiling Dhanna said—‘Maharaj! Well, what type of God you bestowed to me, for many days neither He appeared before me nor ate my bread; He Himself remained hungry and kept me also hungry. At last, having appeared, He began to eat the whole bread, any how with great difficulty, holding His hands, I could get half of the bread saved for myself but Maharaj! He is really a great loving, He remains always with me. He milks my cows both the times. I also cannot leave Him. He is very charming and dear, my life remains always attached to Him.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing Dhannaji’s words, the Brahman asked in astonishment—‘Where is your that Lord?’ Dhanna said—‘Don’t you see? Just see, He is standing near me.’ The Brahman could not have His vision, he said, ‘Where is He Dhanna? I don’t see Him.’ Dhanna began to say to the Lord—‘Lord! This is the Brahman who had given me Your idol, now, why don’t you appear before him?’ The Lord said—‘Dhanna! You have got my glimpse as the fruitful result of the virtuous acts of a number of births of ages past and pure devotion. This Brahman does not possess that power of austerity. But he has amassed a great sum of merit by becoming your Guru. By this virtuous deed he may have My vision. Go and sit in his lap. He will get the divine sight only by the touch of your holy body. Through that divine sight he may be able to see Me.’ Dhanna did so. The devotee Brahman became grateful to see the outstanding beautiful appearance of the Lord. Then, the Lord disappeared.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dhannaji’s child activities came to an end. So, the Lord detached Himself his childlike relation with him. The Lord ordained Dhannaji to take initiation of Guru Mantra by Guruji in a prescribed way to maintain the tradition. Dhannaji went to Kashi and took initiation from the foremost devotee Acharya Shri Ramanandji. Thenafter, he came back home. He attained God-realization. Now, Dhannaji began to realise his great secret treasure in his cavity of heart. Once, Dhannaji’s father sent him to sow the wheat-seed in the field. On the way, some saints came across him. The saints were hungry, they begged of Dhannaji. His own Shyamsunder was visible to him everywhere. So, He saw His vision in the form of the saints. What was there with Dhannaji which could not be donated? He gave the whole seed of wheat to the saints very gladly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It should be kept in mind that wherein scarcity the poors want grain to eat, in their form the Lord, Himself, manifests there and wants our service. Those who miss such opportunity, have to repent much later on. How was it possible for a devotee like Dhannaji to miss the chance?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dhannaji did give the wheat, but out of the fear of his parents, considering it not proper to come back empty-handed, he went to the field after ploughing the field without seeds, he returned home. Affectionate to the devotees, like the tree fulfilling all the desires, to spread Dhanna’s glory without asking anything, the Lord increased the greenery of his field more than that of others through His Divine potency. Dhanna’s field became the subject of discussion among the people for its greenary. Hearing all this, Dhanna thought that he had not sown a single seed in the field, despite it how was the harvest so rich? The field might have been remaining without water, that is why the people would have been making joke. But, when he, himself, saw the field, and found it flourishing, his amazement had no limit. Considering it the Divine potency of the Lord, he saluted the Lord in his own mind. Dhanna’s heart overflowed with the ocean of love. Nabhaji Maharaj writes—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">घर आये हरिदास तिन्हैं गोधूम खवाये।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तात मात डर थोथ खेत लंगूर बवाये॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Dhanna fed wheat to the devotees of God, who came to his house. Out of the fear of his parents he only ploughed the field without any seed. The neighbouring farmer began to praise for the rich harvest of the field. Thus, the proof of his devotion was evident. It created amazement in the world that without sowing seed the field had germinated wheat. Really, blessed is the devotion of Dhanna that without seed there germinated wheat.’</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Chandrahas</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is related to Dvapar Yug. In Kerala state, a righteous king, named, Medhavi ruled there. His only son’s name was Chandrahas. When Chandrahas was of tender age, the enemies killed the king of Kerala in the war. Being chaste, Chandrhas’s mother, burnt herself in the funeral pyre of her husband. The kingdom was occupied by the otherone. In this distressed period, the wet-nurse of Chandrahas took him secretly out of the city and began to live at Kuntalpur. The wet-nurse dedicated to her master, nurtured Chandrahas for three years like her own son by working hard as a maidservent, then after she also passed away. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Chandrahas became orphan and helpless; but the shelter of orphan—the Lord is the helper of helpless. That Supreme Lord of the universe is the sustainer of all the beings. By the grace of God, Chandrahas began to be brought up by the women of the city. His handsome face charmed everyone’s mind. The woman who saw him, loved him like her own son, gave him food and garment to wear. One day, the sage Narada happened to come there wandering about. Considering the child worthy of the right to possess it, gave him an idol of Shri Shalgramji and initiated him with the mantra of the ‘Ram Nam’. The holy-hearted child began to worship the idol of the Lord and chanting of Divine Name. The age of childhood, handsome body, charming face, pleasant and melodious voice and sing of Hari Name were enough to charm one’s mind. So, whosoever saw Chandrahas got fascinated. He became a great righteous and exclusive devotee of the Lord at such small age. When forgetting the consciousness of his body, he sang the Name of the Lord Hari in the melodious voice, a divine moonlight spread all around him. At that time Chandrahas looked as if the dark coloured child, charming to the mind of all, taking the flute in his hand were singing and dancing with Him. Hearing his melodious fascinating pitch of voice Chandrahas got much absorbed.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king of Kuntalpur was a virtuous soul, but he had no issue. He had only a pretty virtuous daughter, whose name was Champakmalini. According to the sermon of the royal priest, the sage Galav, the king spent his whole time in only the reverential sing, meditation and in the company of virtuous persons. The responsibility of the whole royal administration was vested in a minister, named Dhrisht Buddhi. In other words that minister was De-facto ruler of <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>untalpur. He was a big landlord also apart from this, and he possessed immense wealth and property. Dhrisht Buddhi had two able sons named Madan and Amal and a daughter named Vishaya. Madan and Amal supported their father to their best in the royal affairs. Out of them, Madan was Shri Krishna’s devotee and magnanimous. So, in the palaces of the minister, on oneside if there was the dominance of the luxurious objects and the atmosphere of comforts and sensuous enjoyments, on the otherside, sometimes there used to be the congregational assemblage, the guests-receptions and reverential sing of the Lord’s Name. Although Dhrisht Buddhi had no interest in such activities, he remained busy day and night in the royal affairs and amassing money, but he did not restrain also his able son Madan from performing these activities out of affection.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is evening time. Chandrahas is wandering about on the streets of the city singing the Lord’s Name in natural way, hearing his melodious voice many other children also have accompanied him. All are attracting the mind of the inhabitants of the city towards themselves by dancing and singing in the melodious voice in the praise of the Lord. While singing, this group of children overwhelmed by the devotional love came to reach near the palace of Dhrisht Buddhi. The host of sages was also assembling at the residence of the minster’s son, Madan. The discourse on the Lord Hari was going on. Hearing the melodious voice of Lord’s Name by the permission of the sages, Madan called Chandrahas inside the palace. Chandrahas and his companion children began to sing and dance. The assembly of the sages was charmed. In the meanwhile Dhrisht Buddhi also came there. The minds of the sages got enchanted towards Chandrahas being overwhelmed to see the lustrous glow and soft and cool splendour of his face. They seated him beside them. Seeing the traits and symptoms of his body and being assured by their intuition—vision by the Yogic Power, they came to know his talent. They began to say unanimously—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सुन्दर लक्षण-युक्त बाल यह है तपधारी, मन्त्रीवर।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">रक्खो, पालन करो इसे अति स्नेह भावसे अपने घर॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सभी तुम्हारी धन-सम्पतिका यही पूर्ण स्वामी होगा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">होगा नृपति देशका, वैष्णव-पदका अनुगामी होगा॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O the minister! This child, endowed with the meritorious traits, is an austere. Keep him in your palace and bring him up with the affectionate and loving attitude. He will be the sole owner of your entire wealth and property. He will be the king of the country and the follower of the Vaishnav cult.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These words of the sages pierced into the heart of Dhrisht Buddhi like an arrow. Will the child of an unknown clan—‘Gotra’ and an orphan be the master of my property? Whereas my position and glory, property and prosperity, unlimited prowess and influence and on the otherside this street beggar child? At once, his arrogance turned into hostility. A fierce violent attitude arose in Dhrisht Buddhi’s mind. He determined his action. Without disclosing anything to the sages and his sons, Dhrisht Buddhi took the children away in the gynaeceum of his palace pretending to feed them sweet. There, all the boys were turned out after distributing sweet to them, it was only Chandrahas to remain there. In a very short time on the hint of the minister a reliable murderer reached there. Saying something secretly in his ear he gave his hands to him to hold. The murderous man took Chandrahas with him, then, he said, ‘See, the work must be done today, bring some proof, you will get the reward to your satisfaction.’ The murderer disappeared along with the child.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is the dense fierce deserted forest. Everywhere it is the darkness spreading. The murderous person unsheathed the sword. Chandrahas apprehended that he wanted to kill him. He said fearlessly—‘Brother! Wait for a moment let me worship my Lord, then kill me gladly.’ The murderous person’s heart melted a little, ‘He allowed!’ Shedding the tears from his eyes, taking the idol of Shalgramji out of his mouth, Chandrahas offered his worship to the Lord with great love with wild flowers and leaves. Then, he sang with choking throat—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गहो आज हाथ नाथ शरण मैं तिहारी।</p>

It is only You, all in all to the distressed one like me. Considering me Your slave, do according to Your will what is beneficial. O Mohan, the Lord! I am going to die. Meet me removing the delusion.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The pathetic atmosphere spread in the forest. The Lord changed the scene. Two drops of tears fell down from the eyes of the murderer also. His heart changed. He thought to himself—What will be my fate in the end after death to kill this innocent God-devotee child? He gave up his idea of killing him, but there should be any proof for Dhrisht Buddhi. He fell into worry. There were six fingers in one of the feet of Chandrahas. Abruptly, the murderer’s sight fell towards it. His face came to glow. At once, he cut down the sixth finger with the sword. His evil-omen got destroyed automatically. Leaving Chandrahas there, the murderer came back. He showed the finger to Dhrisht Buddhi. It delighted him beyond the limit. He thought that—‘Today, even the infallible words of the sages proved untrue.’</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">In the dense forest the child is all alone; he is suffering from pain in his feet, but from his mouth only the voice of Krishna’s name is coming out. In the meanwhile he saw that an affectionate blue effulgence is moving towards him. At the very moment his entire pain disappeared suddenly like magic. His hunger and thirst pacified, his lotus face came to flourish; he was filled with joy. The female dears of the forest began to lick his feet, the birds provided shadow, the trees began to bestow fruits, the earth turned soft. The child began to repeat the name with sweet and charming voice. The fierce forest came to resound with the loudation of Lord Hari-Name; the animals and bird began to play with him as their own.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">There was a small state, named Chandanpur under the domination of Kuntalpur. The king of that state was Kulindak. Although the state was small, yet it was prosperous with righteousness and wealth; if there was any shortcoming, it was only that the king had no son. By the will of the God, the king Kulindak was passing through that forest with any purpose, where Chandrahas had been left by the murderer. Hearing the melodious reverential sing, the king went to him and he was charmed to see the charming look of the child, The king took him to his lap and after wiping off the dust of his body, he began to ask him his name and whereabouts. Chandrahas said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मम मातापिताकृष्णस्तेनाहं परिपालित:।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘My mother and father is Shri Krishna and I am brought up by Him.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king thought, The Lord, by His divine grace, has sent this Vaishnav divine child to me. Clinging him to his bosom, he got him mounted on the horse and returned home. The queen was blessed with motherhood. The king announced him his adoptee; The whole city was rejoiced.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Chandrahas, first, did not like to study anything; when the teacher taught him, he used to say, ‘My tongue can not pronounce any other word except ‘Hari Name’. But after initiation of the sacred thread in a very short period, he became expert in all the four Vedas and other branches of knowledge. By his virtues he became the life-support to the royal family as well as to the entire subjects. The morality spread in the whole state. The whole small state was overwhelmed by the sing in praise of Hari—the Lord. In every family, the discourse about the Lord Hari started, All began to worship the Lord and keep the ‘Ekadashi fast’. Chandrahas made ‘the reverential sing of the Lord’ compulsory in every school. It was his principle—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">यस्मिञ्छास्त्रे पुराणे च हरिनाम न दृश्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">श्रोतव्यं नैव तच्छास्त्रं यदि ब्रह्मा स्वयं वदेत्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Any Shastra or Puran that does not contain the name of Lord-Hari, is not worth hearing even if it has been spoken by Brahma, Himself.’<span class="char-style-override-15"></span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ten thousand gold coins had been paid as the annual tribute to kuntalpur by the Chandanpur state. Chandrahas sent those gold-coins along with extra wealth which he had got by the victory on the hostile states, to kuntalpur.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dhrisht Buddhi heard, ‘Chandanpur state is now, well-off with wealth and prosperity, the brave prince has got victory over big states, the subjects there, are happy in all respects, the sing of Lord Hari-Name is resounding in the whole state, Then, he became eager to see the management there once. Dhrisht Buddhi reached Chandanpur from Kuntalpur very soon.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Righteous, modest and the brave prince welcomed him whole-heartedly. Dhrisht Buddhi got amazed to see the lotus face of the prince and began to stare at him without wink, but just recognising Chandrahas, his heart was aflame. He himself hatched a conspiracy. By deception, having decided to kill Chandrahas, he wrote a secret letter to his elder son Madan and trying to implement the proverb ‘golden pot full of poison’ handed over the letter to Chandrahas and smiling in pretence, he said—‘Prince! This is an urgent piece of work, there lies the good of the both—yours and mine; so go to Kuntalpur today itself and hand over this letter to the Prince, Madan. Mind it, this letter must not be opened on the way and its secrecy may not be disclosed to anyone except Madan.’</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Chandrahas mounted on the horse and set out at that very moment. Kuntalpur was at the distance of forty-eight miles from there. While reaching there the whole day passed. Out of the city, there was a beautiful garden of the king of Kuntalpur. Chandrahas halted in the garden to drink water and take a little rest to remove the fatigue, he himself drank water in the pleasant pond and also made his horse to drink. He was tired in the way, tying the horse to a side, he laid down under the shade of a tree. The touch of the pleasant fragrant cool air made him asleep.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the same time, the princess, Champak Malini and the minister’s daugter—Vishaya along with other female friends had come in the garden for strolling. After enjoying in different ways, the princess and other female friends went away. By the inspiration of God, Vishaya remained there. The Prince, Chandrahas the humbler of Cupid charmed and won her heart at first sight. She chose the prince as her husband by her innerself. She saw a letter in his hand. Vishaya took the letter slowly. Seeing the letter addressed to her brother and signed by her father, she opened it in curiosity. But just while reading the letter her heart became restless, her body throbbed, her face became gloomy. The content of the letter was—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">स्वस्ति श्री प्रिय पुत्र मदन! देखत यह पाती।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">विष दे देना जिससे हो मम शीतल छाती॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कुल विद्या सौन्दर्य शूरता कुछ न देखना।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मदन शत्रु इस राजकुँवरको हृदय लेखना॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Dear son, Madan! May you be happy, just seeing this letter, give poison (to Chandrahas) so that I may feel cool and contented in my heart. Don’t get charmed seeing his clan, knowledge, handsomeness and heroism, don’t care for all these. Madan! This prince is our enemy. keep it in your mind and heart.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vishaya thought—‘Why is father thinking to give poison to such a charming prince like the lion’s youngone? Probably, he might have mistaken to write overwhelmed by delightfulness to see such an able worth deserving husband for me. The father writes ‘to cool the heart’; who would be anyone whose heart would be cooled by giving poison to such an excellent prince? It is most fortunately such a son-in-law is available; that is why the father has desired to handover me at once to this prince, pleasing to the eyes, humiliating even to Cupid in beauty, ignoring the clan, knowledge etc. It was all good the God did that this letter came to my hands first. If my brother had given poison by mistake, it would have caused a great calamity. Through her logic having decided so Vishaya omitted ‘De’ in between ‘De dena’ and wrote ‘ya’ in place of ‘De’ and added the letter ‘ya’ with the word ‘Vish’, as it made clear to read ‘Vishaya’. ‘Madan Shatru were distinct, she joined these words also together. It made to read ‘Madanshatru’ means enemy of cupid in place of ‘Madan Shatru’. Then closing the letter again with the gum of mango tree as it is, keeping it in the hands of the prince, she joined the company of her female friends. The princess and female friends began to tease her jokingly.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After sometime Chandrahas awoke. The evening was about to set in. At once, reaching there he handed over the letter to Madan. Madan was very much pleased to read the letter. By the permission of the Brahmans, that very day, in the auspicious moment of dusk, Vishaya was married with Chandrahas with befitting ceremony. Madan satisfied the beggars donating them with free hand. On the occasion of the bride’s giving away, the king of Kuntalpur, himself had come there. Seeing the charming appearance of the Prince, and his virtues, the king thought—‘Neither any better matching and able bridegroom for Champakmalini than Chandrahas can be available nor any other better heir for the royal administration than so brave, powerful, talented, modest having noble conduct, and able person like Chandrahas can be available.’ At the same moment the king determined in his mind to surrender the kingship along with his princess daughter to the hands of patient and brave prince Chandrahas.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After three days Dhrisht Buddhi returned. Seeing the quite opposite situation, he was very much shocked; but he did not express his evil mind before anyone. His violent and hostile conscience determined—‘The daughter may be widow, but this enemy must be killed.’ This is the highest limit of evil mindedness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was the temple of goddess Durga in the forest on a mountain far away from the city. He sent a cruel murderer there directing him that if anyone goes there in the evening, he should be beheaded. On the other hand, pretending to smile before Chandrahas, he said to him—‘The goddess Durga is our family Deity. This is the custom of my family to worship the Deity on any auspicious occasion; so, it is today, you should go to the temple in the evening and offer the offering to the goddess.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By the order of his father-in-law, simple-hearted Chandrahas started for the Goddess place with the requisites of worship. Man makes castles in the air to himself like the fools having the most crooked attitude but ‘man proposes, God disposes.’ <span class="char-style-override-12">‘करी गोपालकी सब होय।’</span><span class="char-style-override-14"> </span>God’s will prevails.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sentiment of detachment overpowered the mind of the king. This very day, he determined to go to the forest to practise discipline for attaining the supreme abode abdicating the kingship. But before departure, he had to do the most important two works—first to marry the princess and second to choose anyone as his heir. According to his prior determination calling his minister’s son, Madan he said—‘Son! I want to set out for the forest this very day. I want to handover my daughter’s hands to any able prince bridegroom, and make him the heir of the kingship also. It is our luck that the Lord has sent Chandrahas here, bestowing His grace upon us. He is capable in all respects, go and send Chandrahas here at once.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the king’s words simple hearted Madan’s joy knew no bound. He ran to call his brother-in-law. He was quite unaware of his father’s evil motive. Chandrahas going towards the goddess temple, met him on the way. Telling him the royal command, he sent Chandrahas to the royal palace and he, himself, went to the temple of the goddess with the materials of worship. It is not more to say, that at his just reaching the temple, the murderous person with sharp edged sword cut his body into two pieces. Chandrahas was saved—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जाको राखै साँइयाँ, मार न सकिहैं कोय।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बाल न बाँका करि सकै, जो जग बैरी होय॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘One whom the Lord protects, cannot be killed by anyone. He remains unscathed even if the entire world becomes his enemy.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On this side, the king of Kuntalpur blessed Chandrahas by letting the hands of Champakmalini to him and at the same moment by the instruction of the sage, Galav, Chandrahas was coronated also. By the permission of the sage, Chandrahas was married to Champakmalini, by the mutual consent without any consent of the parents (Gandharv Vivah). ‘Giving up everything, treating the gold, stone and earth equally.’ The king went away to the forest—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">वनं जगाम सन्त्यज्य समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चन:।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dhrisht Buddhi had proposed something but it happened otherwise against his mind—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तेरे मन कुछ और है कर्त्ताके कछु और।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Man proposes, God disposes.’ The next-morning when Dhrisht Buddhi heard the news of the engagement of Chandrahas with Champakmalini and his coronation and the murder of his dear son by the murderer, as if thunder bolt befell on his head. It is true—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">‘परार्थे योऽवटं कर्त्ता तस्मिन् स पतति ध्रुवम्’।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘One who digs pit for the otherone, falls himself into it.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dhrisht Buddhi now being without wits, ran towards the goddess temple. Reaching there he saw that dearer than his heart, his son’s body was lying there into two pieces. Being distressed by the shock wailing excessively, he committed suicide with the sword at the same moment. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing his father-in-law running as a mad, Chandrahas had also followed him. Reaching the temple, Chandrahas saw that the father and the son, both were lying dead. Considering himself the cause of the both death, he tried to kill himself. As soon as, he pulled the sword from the sheath, the goddess Bhawani caught his hands having appeared in person and seated him in her lap. Bereft of his own mother, Chandrahas was overjoyed today to sit in the lap of the mother of the universe.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mother Goddess said—‘My son Chandrahas! Dhrishtbuddhi was very wicked. He had framed many traps to kill you; it was better that he was killed. Yes, this Madan was a devotee and loved you, but at the time of your marriage he had resolved to sacrifice his body for your sake. Considering the donation of wealth and property insufficient. So, today he also became free of debt. So, giving up the sorrow, go and rule. I am pleased, seek the boon as you wish.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Chandrahas said—‘Mother! You want to grant me boon, You are pleased with me, then, grant me the first boon—<span class="char-style-override-12">‘हरौ भक्ति: सदा भूयान्मम जन्मनि जन्मनि।’</span> ‘My devotion to God may continue forever from birth to birth’ and grant me the second boon that both these two persons, dead due to me, may revive to life at this very moment! I am not the least grieved at whatever my father-in-law did to kill me; man is used of doing so because of ignorance. Mother! pardon him, grant him wisdom, destroy his sins, grant him the pure Devotion of the Lord.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> After saying in loving words—‘Be it so!’ the goddess disappeared. Both the father and son got up as if awakened from sleep and they embraced Chandrahas to their bosom.</p>
<p class="Chapter-End-Text">Speak ‘Jai’ to the devotees and their Lord.</p>

I have heard that His beauty is unparallel, His characteristics are unique, these unfortunate eyes could not take even glance of the graceful feet of the Lord and the old age has turned up. Today, in the battlefield, sighting His feet I will make my birth and life worthful.’ Having such a desire, the devotee king Hansdhwaj of Champakpuri, ordered his commander in chief—</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The horse of the Pandavas Ashwamedha Yagya reached Champakpuri. The bravest Arjun armed with divine weapons along with Pradyumna and other braves were following the horse in protection. The king Hansdhwaj heard this news through the messengers and made preparation for the war according to rules of war as prescribed for the Kshatriyas and besides it, being a dedicated devotee, he started for the battlefield with the intense desire to get a look of Arjun’s charioteer Lord Shri Krishna.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king Hansdhwaj was a great righteous person, sustainer of the subjects, most brave, and a great devotee of the Lord. There was one special thing in his kingdom that all the male members of the royal family as well as all male subjects followed the vow of keeping only one wife and all the men and women of the country were the great devotees of the Lord. If anyone from the outside came to this state for employment, the king used to say to him first of all—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">एकपत्नीव्रतं तात यदि ते विद्यतेऽनघ।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘O the sinless! If you follow the vow of keeping a single wife, I can appoint you. Brother! I speak truly that I don’t want worthless heroism, belonging to reputed clan and prowess. The brave who is dedicated to his single wife only and devotee of four-armed Lord Vishnu, can be given place in my house or in my country. Those who are able to withstand the urges of lust, are powerful in true sense.’ Thus, the royal officers and subjects all were votaries of morality and had moral conduct in their lives. The army of the king consisted of all the warriors—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सर्वे ते वैष्णवा वीरा: सदा दानपरायणा:।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘God devotee, Warriors self-restrained, all of them were given to charity and sweet in speech.’ So, all the braves became ready to face Arjun in the war according to the order of the king. The horse was caught. According to the command of royal priests the foremost sage, Shankh and Likhit, the great theologist and scholar of ethics, the fierce proclaimation was made for all the warriors to be present in the battlefield by the scheduled time. ‘Anyone, who fails to reach in time, will be thrown into the cauldron full of boiling oil. This order was equally applicable to the king’s grandsons, sons and brothers also’—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">All the commanders of the king, ministers, the brothers and the four sons—Subal, Surath, Sam and Sudarshan moved towards the battlefield. The name of the youngest son was Sudhanva. Brave Sudhanva went to his mother who had given birth to this brave son, to seek her permission and reaching there and bowing his head to her feet he began to say—‘Mother! Today, I am going to fight war against the reputed hero, Arjun fortunately. Permit me so that I may win and bring Hari (horse) guarded by Arjun.’ The brave mother was a great God-devotee; She knew it very well that it was difficult for her son to return safe from the battlefield. So, the mother said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गच्छ पुत्र हरिं युद्धे विजित्य मम सन्निधौ।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">हरिं चतुष्पदं त्यक्त्वा तं समानय मुक्तिदम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Son! Going to the battlefield, bring ‘Hari’, winning him; but you should bring the saviour ‘Hari’, and not the four-footed animal. Your glorious father has got victory over so many braves till today, but he could not get the glimpse of Shri Krishna till now. Today, O my son! May you prove to be the cause of providing us the vision of Shri <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>rishna! Today perform such deeds as may please Shri <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>rishna. You are the most fortunate that today you will get opportunity to see Shri <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>rishna in person with your eyes, but it is very difficult to meet Shri <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>rishna. I am telling you a device. The Lord is affectionate to His devotees, it is His affection to the devotees that He had driven the chariot of Arjun in the fierce battle of Kurukshetra. Even today, He may come for Arjun’s protection, so, if you could demoralise, Arjun, or you could make him restless, Shri Krishna might appear before you. I have heard that Shri Krishna cannot leave His devotee in the same way as a cow does not return home leaving her calf in the forest—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">स्वभक्तं न त्यजत्येष मनाक् पुत्र मया श्रुतम्।</p>

If you are afraid of, all will laugh at me that my son fled away in the war seeing Shri Krishna. I will be happy, if you fall down in the battlefield while fighting and get the highest abode of the braves. ‘Son! <span class="char-style-override-5">m</span>ind it that the person dying before Shri Krishna in the battlefield, does not die really, he becomes able to redeem his past twenty-one generations.’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">हरे: किं सम्मुखे पुत्र पतित: पतितो भवेत्।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Only, those mothers have to weep in the world, whose sons and grand sons don’t turn towards the Lord Shri Hari.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, the true mother, Sumitra Devi also had given the same sermon to her dear son, Lakshman—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पुत्रवती जुबती जग सोई। </p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">राम बिमुख सुत तें हित जानी॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘That woman alone can be said to have borne a son, whose son is a devotee of Ram (the Lord of Raghus).  Otherwise it is better she remains issueless; for she who deems herself fortunate in having a son hostile to Ram has yeaned in vain.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the noble sermon of his mother, the brave Sudhanva said consoling his mother—‘Mother! According to your command, fighting whole-heartedly in the war, I will bring Hari. Manliness is my duty, the fruit is in the hands of the Lord; but if I deviate seeing Shri Krishna, I would neither be said born of your womb, nor would I be entitled to salvation. Blessed is such a son.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then after seeking permission from his sister, <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>ubala and being encouraged, Sudhanva went to his chaste wife Prabhavati. She was already standing to perform Arati with earthen lamp, sandal and camphor in the golden platter. The faithful and devoted wife adored her brave husband with great love and devotion, then, with patience performing the Arti, she began to say the profound and loving words to her brave husband—‘O my lord! I am viewing your lotus-face, eager to see Shri <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>rishna, but my lord, it seems that your vow of single wife will be broken today. But, the woman to whom being attached, you are departing with enthusiasm, can never stand equal to me. I have never cast my glance to anyone except you, even by mistake, but this charming lady named ‘Mukti’ approaches to all—father, sons and everyone. Your mind is dwelling on Mukti, that is why you are running with the hope to meet her through Shri Krishna. The mind of the mankind is attracted by the divine fairies in natural way, but be assured that you will never love Mukti to see the unparellel beautiful appearance of Shri Hari’s face; because His devotees who sacrifice themselves on His sweet love, are never fond of Mukti. ‘Mukti’ remaining always in search of the opportunity to serve their feet like a maidservent, runs after them, but they never even glance towards her. To this extent even, if the Lord Hari Himself wants deliberately to bestow them with Mukti, even then, they don’t accept it. That is why, the Lord has said in the praise of their virtues—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सालोक्यसार्ष्टिसामीप्यसारूप्यैकत्वमप्युत।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दीयमानं न गृह्णन्ति विना मत्सेवनं जना:॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘My devotees attached to Me, accept not in exchange for my service viz., <span class="char-style-override-6">Salokya, Sarshti, Samipya, Sarupya and Ekatva</span>—‘these five types of Mukti even when they are offered to them, your desire for Mukti is only till you do not see His matchless sweet charming appearance. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Apart from this alike gents, the ladies don’t go to any other person. Otherwise, after your departure, if I go to the salvation (Moksha) what can you do? But the invisible son named Vivek ‘Wisdom’, always protects me. Those women who have no son named Vivek, go to other person. From the very childhood I am fortunate to have son-wisdom, that is why, O Arya! I feel hesitated to go to Moksha. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Answering the sweet touching words of his wife, Sudhanva said—‘O the auspicious! When I am going to fight against Shri Krishna, how can I check you from going to Moksha? You, too, should go having abandoned any costly garments, the gold, gems and jewels, this body and mental attachment. I knew it from the beginning that you are attracted towards Moksha. That is why I didn’t try to bear the son named Vivek in bodily form.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Prabhavati said—‘O the lord of my heart! <span class="char-style-override-5">y</span>ou are going to fight with Arjun, but the son wisdom, who is in my heart, I want to see that—Vivek with my eyes. I want that after your departure, there must remain a son to offer libation to manes.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sudhanva—‘I can come back to you even after winning Shri Krishna and Arjun.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Prabhavati—‘No my lord! One who has aleady viewed Shri Krishna, never comes back to this world.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sudhanva—‘If it is your firm conviction that anyone who has glanced Shri Krishna, gets rid of birth and death, then, it is worthless to desire for a son to offer libation?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Prabhavati—‘You should do fulfil my desire also.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sudhanva—‘O the auspicious! Don’t you know the strict ruler, his majesty? A little delay means to be ready to face the boiling oil of the cauldron. All braves and warriors have already reached, except me?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lot of questions and answers were made. At last, in this moral conflict, chaste Prabhavati was the winner. Sudhanva, again performed ‘bathing and pranayam and mounted on the chariot started for the battlefield.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the battlefield the warriors in so many groups were gathering. All around, the sound of the trumpet and conch shell was resounding. All the four princes and commanders paid respectful salutation to the majesty Hansdhwaj. But the foremost among the braves, the prince Sudhanwa did not reach still. The majesty king said to the General-in-chief—‘What is the matter; I don’t see Sudhanwa here. How did he commit this inadvertence? Did he forget my strict order? He committed a great blunder, but a few soldiers should go and holding that rogue by hair and dragging on the ground bring near the cauldron.’ With stricken heart and due to strict command, the soldiers had to obey his order. Some soldiers moved to obey his strict order. Sudhanva met them on the way reaching near the feet of his father, Sudhanva saluted him very humbly and presented the brief of getting delay before his father. The king Hansdhwaj was getting impatient in rage. He said—‘You are a great fool. Without the grace of the Lord, only the son cannot help one in getting the salvation. If only those having sons, could get salvation, then, the dogs and swines must get salvation. Curse to your vitality, thinking and morality! Even when you heard the news of Shri Krishna and your mind was overpowered by passion, such a evil son of polluted mind, intent on sensuousness and hostile to Krishna, deserves to be thrown into the boiling oil in the cauldron.’ Bowing his head down, Sudhanva heard all his words very patiently.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king sent the messenger to the priest Shankh and Likhit for the decree. The priest was of very hot tempered. Just hearing the words of the messenger, he said—‘The king enquires of the decree about the action, because of his attachment to his son. When there is the same rule for all, where arises the question of ruling? That tardy spirit, who is not true to his words due to greed or fear, suffers the unbearable pain of the hell for a long time. The king Harischandra and Ramchandra, the Dasarath’s son are the obvious examples, what a trouble, some difficulties had come on their ways and what distress they had suffered to keep their words. Today, Hansdhwaj want to prove his words false due to the attachment of his son; so we don’t want to live in the state of such an immoral king.’ Saying so, both the relentless sages set out. The messengers conveyed the detail to the king. Having placed the order to the minister to throw out Sudhanva in the boiling oil of the cauldron, Hansdhwaj started for appeasing the priests. The minster is very much pained, but there is no other way. The minister begged for pardon by so many ways and then, he put his submission about his duty. Sudhanva said patiently—‘O the able minister! You must obey the order of your majesty. Shri Parashuramji had cut down the head of his mother to keep the words of his father. I am not afraid of death at all. Without any hesitation, throw me into the boiling oil. All heard Sudhanva’s words being spell-bound. Tears flowed from the eyes of people all around. But Sudhanva was cheerful. Having put on divine garments, he wore the basil-garland around his neck and remembering Lord Vasudev <br/>Shri Krishna and saying so, he jumped into the boiling hot oil of the cauldron—‘O Hare! O Govinda!! O the destroyer of devotees-fear!!! I am the least afraid of death, I had come deliberately to surrender my life to Your feet, but ignoring You in the meantime, I served the purpose of passion, it seems that I remain deprived of Your apparent look and that is why O Lord! You are not extending Your hands to protect me. Those, who remember you only in their sufferings, being afraid of these, it seems, are not the gainer of pleasure. The devotee Prahlad, Dhruv, Draupadi and Gopis etc., had remembered You earlier also, that is why You saved them in their calamities. At the time of death by remebering You, and meditating you, you are attained. So, O Janardan! I will certainly attain You, but it will create a history that in spite of being vigorous and brave turning his face from the war, Sudhanva died burning himself into the boiling hot oil of the cauldron. If I had died by pleasing You and your devotee, Arjun by the rain of my arrows in the battlefield and being into pieces by the pointed arrow of the Gandiva of Arjun, I would have not been worried, but today, I am dying like a guilty thief. So, if you consider such type of death of this child improper, then saving this body from the burning fire, let it fall down on Your feet. I am your own, and will remain your own. You are potent in all respects, lying down into the ocean of shame, before Pitamah Bhishma and the preceptor, Dronacharya by incarnating in the form of clothes You had protected Draupadi.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord’s sport is wonderful. One day, the Lord had made the fire cool, for Prahlad sake. One day, to humble the arrogance of Indra, the Remover of arrogance had made it deprived of its power. Today, to save His devotee Sudhanva also the hot oil became cool like the noble men’s conscience. <span class="char-style-override-12">‘तैलं सुशीतलं जातं सज्जनस्येव मानसम्’</span> Sudhanva was oblivious of his body in the loving memory of the holy names of ‘Govind, Damodar, Madhav etc. In the cauldron, he was obsessed in love. Sudhanva is not burning in spite of remaining in the boiling oil and he is floating on the surface of the oil. Seeing this, the people’s amazement was beyond limit. The king, Hansdhwaj also with his both priests had already reached there. The king also was much amazed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bereft of Devotion and love of the Lord, depending on logic and arrogance of talent the proud priest Shankh said to the king creating suspicion on Sudhanva—‘O king! What is the matter? Is the oil not hot or your son knows any medicine or spell? His face is glowing with lustre like the blossomed lotus? There is not a single blister even on his body. However, it seems to be some cunningness behind it. If the oil had been really hot, it would never be so in anyway. Not to be burnt with hot oil is against Nature.’ Oh! The Brahman preceptor of morality, religion and Shastras! You could not know yet the God is the Lord of Nature. Not with His will but with His resolve merely, the impossible becomes possible—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मसकहिं करइ विरंचि प्रभु अजहि मसक ते हीन।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The Lord may make a mosquito, Brahma, and Brahma may turn even inferior to a mosquito.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shankh could not restrain himself. He got a coconut dropped into the cauldron to test the oil. Just being dropped into the boiling hot oil, the coconut burst, it was divided into two parts and springing out, fell on the heads of Likhit and Shankh, both the sages forcibly. The sage got disturbed. Now, his eyes opened. They came to realise the significance of the Lord and His devotees.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The foremost sage Shankh asked the servants the reason of Sudhanva’s remaining unscathed, in the boiling oil. Had he chanted or muttered any spell or he had tied any herb in his body which saved him from the flaming heat of the oil? The servants said very humbly—‘O the foremost sage! We didn’t see the prince muttering any Mantra or tying any medicine. Yes, there was one thing, being distressed, the prince had remembered that supreme Lord Shri Krishna, no doubt whose memory releases human being from the bondage of life and death. <span class="char-style-override-12">‘यस्य स्मरणमात्रेण मुच्यते योनिसंकटात्’</span> Sudhanva’s fluttering lips may be marked even now; how Shri Krishna’s name is being constantly muttered. Hearing this, the sage said cursing himself—‘He is really a blessed one and a great saint as he got his mind anchored so much in the memory of the Lord! Curse to the preceptors like us who are turning far away from the Lord to be proud of our knowledge!’ In the same way one day, in Braj, the Brahmans performing Yagyas had cursed themselves being impressed by the unparallel love of their wives to the Lord Shri Krishna and had said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">धिग् जन्म नस्त्रिवृद्विद्यां धिग् व्रतं धिग् बहुज्ञताम्।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(Shrimadbha. 10/23/39—43)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Fie upon our threefold birth (being born of Brahmana parents, investiture with the sacred thread and consecration for the sacrifice) and learning; fie upon our sacred vow of continence; fie upon our versatile knowledge; fie upon our pedigree and fie upon our proficiency in rituals whenever have turned our face away from Lord Shri Krishna. Indeed the Lord’s Maya—deluding potency, is capable of infatuating even those who are adept in Yoga. That is why, we, who are Brahmans and teachers of men, are ignorant of our real interst. Look at the devotion of our women to Shri Krishna, the father of the universe, the depth of which cannot be easily fathomed by us and which has cut asunder the snares of death going by the name of household ties. Neither was the purificatory rite, which is peculiar to the males of twice born classes undergone by them nor they reside in the preceptor’s house for learning. No austerities were ever performed by them, nor was any enquiry made about the spirit, nor is purity seen in them, nor do any virtuous acts characterize them. Yet there is found in them unswerving devotion to Shri Krishna of excellent renown the Lord of all masters of Yoga which does not appear in us, who have undergone the aforesaid purificatory rite and are endowed with all the other qualifications.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Really, this is the fact also that he is the great and wise who always lives in the shelter of the Lord, constantly meditating and adoring His feet. That is why the foremost devotee Prahlad had said that even, if the Brahmans, endowed with all the twelve characteristics of virtues have turned away from the lotus feet of the cosmic lotus-Lord, as compared to the pariah, who has surrendered his life with his body, mind, speech, wealth and action to the Lord, is superior. That God devotee pariah can purify his all the generations; but that highly respected <span class="char-style-override-5">B</span>rahman cannot purify even himself. (Shrimadvagavad—7/9/9) </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Today, Shankh Muni repents for what he did and he says—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रायश्चित्तं स्वदेहस्य करिष्ये मरणान्तकम्।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I will atone for till I die by jumping into this boiling oil of the cauldron.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Saying so the sage jumped into the hot oil of the cauldron; but by the benedictory sentiment of Sudhanva that boiling oil became cool for him also. The sage embraced Sudhanva to his bosom and said with choking voice—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Dear prince! You are the foremost saint and a Kshatriya brave, you are blessed; really, I am an immoral <span class="char-style-override-5">B</span>rahman, I, the fool caused a devotee like you to fall into the boiling hot oil. I came to understand that in this world only that man gets always anguish, grief and dearth, who does not remeber the Lord Shri Krishna.’ Those fortunate persons who always remember the Lord Govinda, dispenser of fruits of every action, become quite happy forever being free from all the three afflictions of the world—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">ये स्मरन्ति च गोविन्दं सर्वकामफलप्रदम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तापत्रयविनिर्मुक्ता जायन्ते दु:खवर्जिता:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Where is such a blaze in the fire that may burn a Vaishnav like you? That Lord Shri Krishna—the preceptor of gods, and demons all—is not obtainable even to the Munis, who had protected one day, the devotee Prahlad from blazing fire, you remembered the same Lord at the last time of your life with your mind and speech. O the lion of the mankind! My impure body got purified by your merely touch today. There is no other better means to purity. The sacred place of pilgrimages are worthy of its value only by the devotees. The great king Yudhishthir had said to Vidur—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">भवद्विधा भागवतास्तीर्थभूता: स्वयं विभो।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति तीर्थानि स्वान्त:स्थेन गदाभृता॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Shrimadbha. 1/13/10)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Lord! The God devotees like you are in yourself is a pilgrimage. The sacred places, made impure by the sinners, are sanctified by the devotees like you; because the Supreme Lord always dwells in your heart.’ It has been said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अक्ष्णो: फलं त्वादृशदर्शनं हि </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तन्वा: फलं त्वादृशगात्रसंग:। </p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सुदुर्लभा भागवता हि लोके॥ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Worth of the eyes in getting the glimpse of the devotees like you, in the touch of the limbs of the bodies of the devotees like you lies the worth of this body and to sing in the praise of the devotees like you, lies the worth of the tongues because it is rare to get the glimpse of the devotees like you in the world.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">राजानं राजपुत्रांश्च सैन्यं पावय सुव्रत।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">उत्तिष्ठ वत्स तैलात्त्वं मां समुद्धर भूपज॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कृष्णोऽयं पाण्डवस्याथ सारथ्यं प्रकरोति च।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अर्जुनेनाद्य संग्रामं कुरु वीर यथोचितम्॥ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O the holy prince! O the dear child! Stand up. Come out of the oil, get sanctified your father, four elder brothers, the whole army as well as me also. O the brave! now, go and fight in the battlefield against Arjun, whose chariot is driven by the Lord Shri Krishna, do the best of your capacity.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Coming out with the sage, Sudhanva went to his father. The sage highly praised his devotion and his immense influence before the king. The king clasped his son to his bosom and with choking throat blessing him for his welfare, commanded to give due welcome to unique Arjun in battle.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Receiving the command of his father, Sudhanva reached the battlefield at once, mounting on his excellent chariot. On both the sides, different types of war trumpets were being blown. The tumultuous sound of conch-shells began to resound. The earth trembled with the uproar of trumpets and chariots, horses and elephants. The fierce war broke out. On the Pandavas side, under the command of the great warrior Arjun along with a huge army there are Shri Krishna’s son Pradyumna, Karn’s son, Brishketu, Kritverma, Satyaki, Anushalva and other renowned warriors. On this side under the leadership of Sudhanva there is the huge army of the king, Hansdhwaj. Shri Krishna’s devotee gallant Kshatriya prince, Sudhanva gave defeat to Brishketu, Pradyumna, Kritverma, Satyaki and Anushalva and other warriors one by one. After the great war all were bound to leave the warfield having either accepted their defeat or being wounded. At last, Arjun, himself came on the front.* On both the sides there are great devotees of the Lord and unconquerable braves. There is only the difference that Arjun is an experienced brave of many wars and Sudhanva is a fresh warrior. Arjun is somewhat proud of his devotion and heroism; Sudhanva depends completely on the Lord. That is why the Lord wants to give a lesson apparently that neither anyone is monopolist of Devotion nor of bravery even. He is to be taught specially that in the absence of the Lord Shri Krishna’s help and association, Arjun can be defeated even by a child in the war.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-16">* Read the character of ‘Pandav-Arjun’ in my book—‘Adarsh Bhakti’.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Coming in front of Sudhanva, Arjun said to him—‘Brave young man! I have already won many big wars. I have fought the war with the great powerful preceptor Dron, Pitamaha Bhishma, the family priest Kripacharya and Mahatma Karna also. I have already faced the Lord Shiva and big demons even in the warfield, but I found nowhere any so brave as you.’ The amazement what I felt to see you, I felt nowhere else—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तथा न विस्मयो जातो यथा त्वां वीक्ष्य जायते?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sudhanva said—‘O the foremost brave! In the wars, what you fought previously? The Lord Shri Krishna your great helper, was sitting on your chariot very carefully. Today, you are without Shri Krishna, that is why you are feeling amazed? How have you given up Shri Krishna? Isn’t it that Shri Krishna has abandoned you, while fighting with me? Tell me, whether you are capable to fight the war against me or not?’ Hearing the words of Sudhanva, Arjun got enraged and began to rain the arrows on him. Laughing, Sudhanva cut down all his divine arrows instantly—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सुधन्वा ताञ्छरान् दिव्यांश्चिच्छेद प्रहसन्निव।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A fierce war was fought. Arjun fought to the best of his capacity; but it proved futile before Sudhanva. Arjun got perturbed by the war-skill of Sudhanva and his constant arrow rain, his charioteer fell down being wounded. Seeing this Sudhanva said laughing—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">शरै: क्षतोऽसि पार्थ त्वं पौरुषं क्व गतं च ते।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सर्वज्ञं सारथिं त्यक्त्वा प्राकृत: सारथि: कृत:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">स्मर स्वसूतं कृष्णाख्यं ममाग्रे पतितो ह्यसि॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Arjun! You have been wounded by my arrows, where is your prowess today? O the greatest of brave! You have committed a great blunder by replacing your omniscient charioteer by appointing an ordinary charioteer. You have fallen down before me, so at once, remember your charioteer, Shri Krishna.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjun started fighting holding the rein of the horse with the bow with his left hand and remembered pitiously in his mind Lord Shri Krishna, the soul of his life and the substratum of the universe. The moment, he remembered only, at once the Lord Shri Krishna sat on his chariot, He was noticed saying to Arjun, ‘Brother! Leave the reins of the horses’—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मुंच चाश्वानर्जुनेति व्याजहार वचो हरि:।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing the Lord Vasudev infront of their eyes Arjun and Sudhanva both saluted Him. It was but natural for Arjun to be joyous, but Sudhanva’s happiness is somewhat different. Now, that auspicious work has been accomplished for which he had exhausted Arjun in the battlefield after seeking the permission of his parents and with the consent of his beloved wife. Sudhanva felt grateful to see the Lord’s divine-splendour and His incomparable charming appearance and His affection to the devotee. Having saluted the Lord in mind itself again and again according to the inspirations of the Lord, he said outwardly—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दृष्टस्त्वमसि गोविन्द पाण्डवार्थे समागत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सर्वगत्वं मया ज्ञातं त्वदीयं किल केशव:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Govind! I did have your vision though you appeared here for the sake of Arjun. O Keshav! I have realised Your omnipresence.’ Indicating these mysterious words to the Lord, smiling Sudhanva said to Arjun, ‘O Arjun! <span class="char-style-override-5">y</span>our charioteer, Shri Krishna has already come, at least, now make promise to win me.’ By these words, as if he made Arjun understand that Shri Krishna was not only his charioteer but He was his also all in all. He will fulfil your promise by donating His righteousness to protect you but He will protect my promise by only His resolve. Today the entire universe will watch this frolicsome activity of Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the challenge of Sudhanva, taking out three arrows and taking vow, Arjun said—‘With these three arrows I will make your beautiful head fall down, being detached from your body. If I fail to do so, let my forefathers fall down into the hell being deprived of their meritorious deeds. My words are completely true and nothing is false in it.’ Hearing the promise of Arjun, mad of death the great devotee brave Sudhanva declared raising his hands—‘Before the eyes of Shri Krishna, I will cut down your all the three arrows. If I fail to do so, may I meet horrible fate!’ From both the sides verbal contradictory promises were being made. Both are great braves and great devotees of God. All the brave warriors of both the armies and all the gods and sages became curious to see this amusing spectacle.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By the rain of his arrows, Sudhanva, having wounded Arjun along with Shri Krishna broke the chariot partly and by the skill of his arrows, he began to revolve round the chariot just like the wheel. Then, having covered Arjun with ten arrows, he shot such an arrow that pushed his chariot at quite a distance back. Seeing this Lord said to Arjun—‘Brother! Did you see the prowess of Sudhanva? What an excellent brave he is! You were not right while making such a hard promise without consulting Me. Did you forget that occurence, what a great trouble had been erupted in the murder of Jayadrath? How can you win before that gallant one who removed your chariot underpress of your legs, four hundred hands back with a single arrow. In my opinion this is the influence of Sudhanva’s vow of being devoted to a single wife. In this single-wife-devotion, both of us are far behind. In such a situation a great affliction is certain.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjun said—‘O Govind! When You have come here, what is fear to me then? Certainly I will let Sudhanva fall down in the battle field with these three arrows. Now, there is no possibility of great affliction for me. When the rein of my life-chariot is in Your hands, how can any one assail any harm to me?’ Arjun took the first arrow in his hand; Sudhanva made the loudation, ‘Govind! Just as You had lifted the Govardhan mountain on Your hands to protect the cows in Gokul, in the same way, protect your devotee, Arjun today, but remember that, I am also Your slave’s slave.’ The Lord merging the fruits of His virtuous deed of uplifting the Govardhan mountain with the arrow to keep the flag of Sudhanva’s gloryflying forever and to protect Arjun. Arjun’s arrow ran to work like the fire of death but the virtuous foremost devotee Sudhanva cut it down in a moment. The king Hansdhwaj along with his army got delighted. Just when Arjun’s arrow proving to be futile, the earth began to tremble. The gods fell into wonder. Praising Sudhanva’s prowess, and praising the action of life protection, the Lord commanded Arjun to shoot an other arrow and besides it, he merged fruits of his other many meritorious deeds. Sudhanva said—‘Govind! Really, Your sportive activities are praiseworthy. But remember that Your this slave is also well-acquanited with Your sportive activities.’ Again, He said to Arjun—‘Parth! <span class="char-style-override-5">s</span>hoot the arrow remembering the Lord Shri Krishna.’ Arjun’s catastrophic arrow started but Sudhanva cut it down also in the middle by virtue of his valour. Arjun became somewhat sad on the failure of his second arrow and an uproar was created in the battlefield. All around, the prowess of Sudhanva began to be admired. Thenafter the Lord ordered Arjun to shoot the third arrow and joined the merit of His incarnation of Ram Avatar to this third arrow. In the back of the arrow, it was the Lord Brahma and in the middle joining it with Time Spirit (death) and He placed Himself at the front point. Sudhanva said—‘Lord! You have abiden Yourself in the arrow to kill me; I have come to know it. Come, O the Lord! Oblige me to provide the shelter of Your feet in the battlefield. This was what I wanted. What will be a better luck than this for me? Arjun! You are fortunate that the Lord, Himself, not only offer you His virtuous actions but He Himself have abiden in your arrow also. <span class="char-style-override-5">i</span>t will do good to you. But be careful, by the grace of the Lord, Shri Krishna, I will cut down your this arrow also.’ Arjun shot his arrow, but the foremost brave Sudhanva, muttering the name of the Lord, cut it down also at once. The half portion of the arrow cut down by Sudhanva, fell down on the earth. Just the moment, the arrow was cut down, disc of the moon trembled. The devotee Sudhanvas promise was protected. Now, Arjun’s promise will be protected, so, by the Lord’s inspiration, the half portion of the arrow raised up and detached the beautiful lustrous head of Sudhanva with the rings in his ears and rich with the prowess from his body at once.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sudhanva’s headless trunk and body ruined the Pandava’s army comletely and his delightful blessed head, pronouncing with joy the names of <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>eshav, Ram, Nrisinga etc., different god’s names fell down on the lotus feet, sanctifier of the universe of Lord Shri <span class="char-style-override-5">k</span>rishna. </p>
