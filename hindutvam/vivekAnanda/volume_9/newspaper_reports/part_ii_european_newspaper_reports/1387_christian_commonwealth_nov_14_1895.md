## THE CHRISTIAN COMMONWEALTH

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 3, pp. 267-69.)

\[*Christian Commonwealth*, November 14, 1895\]

South Place Chapel Lecture

"The Swami Vivekananda" enlightened the congregation at South-place
Chapel last Sunday morning on "The Basis of Vedanta Morality." (A
lecture delivered in London, England, on November 10, 1895, of which
there is no verbatim transcript available.) . . .

The Swami explained that in the system of morality which he was
expounding actions were not inspired by any hope of reward, here or
hereafter, nor by any fear of punishment in this world or in the beyond:
"We must work simply from the impetus within, work for work's sake, duty
for duty's sake." This idea of morality is claimed to be superior to the
religion of Jesus, and so has beguiled some so-called Christians into
Buddhism or other Eastern philosophies. But the essence of true
Christianity is that, if your actions are inspired by the heavenly
kingdom within you, Paradise will be the result, whereas, if you act in
harmony with the devil's kingdom without you will land in Perdition. The
genuine Christian does not, as the Swami seemed to suggest, act for the
purpose of evading punishments, but at the same time he sees the
ultimate consequences of all actions. . . .
