## FRAGMENTARY NOTES ON THE RAMAYANA

Worship Him who alone stands by us, whether we are doing good or are
doing evil; who never leaves us even; as love never pulls down, as love
knows no barter, no selfishness.

Râma was the soul of the old king; but he was a king, and he could not
go back on his word.

"Wherever Rama goes, there go I", says Lakshmana, the younger brother

The wife of the elder brother to us Hindus is just like a mother.

At last he found Sitâ, pale and thin, like a bit of the moon that lies
low at the foot of the horizon.

Sita was chastity itself; she would never touch the body of another man
except that of her husband.

"Pure? She is chastity itself", says Rama.

Drama and music are by themselves religion; any song, love song or any
song, never mind; if one's whole soul is in that song, he attains
salvation, just by that; nothing else he has to do; if a man's whole
soul is in that, his soul gets salvation. They say it leads to the same
goal.

Wife — the co-religionist. Hundreds of ceremonies the Hindu has to
perform, and not one can be performed if he has not a wife. You see the
priests tie them up together, and they go round temples and make very
great pilgrimages tied together.

Rama gave up his body and joined Sita in the other world.

Sita — the pure, the pure, the all-suffering!

Sita is the name in India for everything that is goods pure, and holy;
everything that in women we call woman.

Sita — the patient, all-suffering, ever-faithful, ever-pure wife!
Through all the suffering she had, there was not one harsh word against
Rama.

Sita never returned injury.

"Be Sita!"
