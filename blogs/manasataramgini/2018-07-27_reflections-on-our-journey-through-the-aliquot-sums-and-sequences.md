**The numerology of aliquot sums and perfect numbers  
**The numerology of the Pythagorean sages among the old yavana-s is one
of the foundations of science and mathematics as we know it. One
remarkable class of numbers which they discovered were the perfect
numbers — teleios as they termed it. What are these numbers? Let
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n") be
a number and
![d\_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"d_j") be all its proper divisors, i.e. those divisors of
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n"),
which are less than
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n").
Then we can define an arithmetic function known as the aliquot sum
![s(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(n)") thus,

![\\displaystyle s(n)=\\sum\_{j=1}^k d\_j;
d\_k\<n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+s%28n%29%3D%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Ek+d_j%3B+d_k%3Cn&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle s(n)=\\sum_{j=1}^k d_j; d_k\<n")

For example, let us consider the number 10. Its divisors are 1, 2,5,10.
Its proper divisors are 1, 2, 5. Hence,
![s(10)=1+2+5=8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2810%29%3D1%2B2%2B5%3D8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(10)=1+2+5=8"). Now, if
![s(n)=n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29%3Dn&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(n)=n") then
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n") is
called a perfect number (termed pūrṇāṅka in Jagannātha’s Sanskrit
edition of Euclid). From Figure 1, we can see that the numbers 6 and 28
are perfect numbers. The Pythagorean interest in them also becomes
apparent from the fact that these numbers are associated with certain
natural periodicities that have an old Indo-European significance. This
becomes clear from their occurrence even in old Hindu tradition. The
number 6 is associated with the 6 seasons in brāhmaṇa-s like the
Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa and encoded into the śrauta altar. Similarly 28 is
also encoded into the altar according to the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa and
corresponds to the count of the nakṣatra-s or days of the lunar month.
The number 28 is also used in Vaidika tradition as one of the prescribed
counts for the japa of the Savitṛ gāyatrī

Returning to the arithmetic, with our above example of
![s(10)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2810%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(10)"), we can see that
![s(n)n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(n)n"). Such numbers are called abundant numbers. Now, a subset of the
proper divisors of 20 add up to 20 (Figure 1). Hence, it is also a
semi-perfect or a pseudo-perfect number. There is a rare set of abundant
numbers for which no subset of their proper divisors add up to them;
they are known as weird numbers. For example,
![s(70)=74](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%2870%29%3D74&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(70)=74"); hence, it is an abundant number. However, no subset of its
proper divisors, 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35 add up to 70. Hence, 70 is a
weird number. The next weird number is 836. Thus, due their rarity
majority of abundant numbers are semiperfect numbers.

One of the high points of yavana brilliance was the discovery of a
general formula for perfect numbers. In Book 9, proposition 36 Euclid
states:

*“ean apo monados hoposoioun arithmoi hexēs ektethōsin en tē diplasioni
analogia, heōs hou ho sumpas suntetheis prōtos genētai, kai ho sumpas
epi ton eskhaton pollaplasiastheis poiē tina, ho genomenos teleios
estai.”*

If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be set out
continuously in double proportion, until the sum of all becomes prime,
and if the sum multiplied into the last make some number, the product
will be perfect.

In modern terms we can lay it out thus: If the sum of the series of the
powers of 2, where the power are integers ![\\ge
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cge+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\ge 0"), is a prime number then the product of that prime with the
last power of 2 in the series is a perfect number:

![q=\\displaystyle \\sum\_{j=0}^n
2^j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D0%7D%5En+2%5Ej&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"q=\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=0}^n 2^j")

If ![q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "q")
is a prime then ![q\\cdot
2^n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%5Ccdot+2%5En&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"q\\cdot 2^n") is a perfect number. Let us take the first few
examples.  
![2^0+2^1=3\\Rightarrow 2^1\\times
3=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E0%2B2%5E1%3D3%5CRightarrow+2%5E1%5Ctimes+3%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

![2^0+2^1+2^2=7\\Rightarrow 2^2\\times

"2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3=15 \\Rightarrow") Not a prime  
![2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4=31\\Rightarrow 2^4\\times
31=496](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E0%2B2%5E1%2B2%5E2%2B2%5E3%2B2%5E4%3D31%5CRightarrow+2%5E4%5Ctimes+31%3D496&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4=31\\Rightarrow 2^4\\times 31=496")  
![2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5=63\\Rightarrow](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E0%2B2%5E1%2B2%5E2%2B2%5E3%2B2%5E4%2B2%5E5%3D63%5CRightarrow&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5=63\\Rightarrow") Not a prime  
![2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6=127\\Rightarrow 2^6\\times
127=8128](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E0%2B2%5E1%2B2%5E2%2B2%5E3%2B2%5E4%2B2%5E5%2B2%5E6%3D127%5CRightarrow+2%5E6%5Ctimes+127%3D8128&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6=127\\Rightarrow 2^6\\times 127=8128")  
After this point the perfect numbers become much less frequent and
large.  
![2^0...2^{12}=8191 \\Rightarrow
33550336](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E0...2%5E%7B12%7D%3D8191+%5CRightarrow+33550336&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^0...2^{12}=8191 \\Rightarrow 33550336")  
![2^0...2^{16}=131071 \\Rightarrow
8589869056](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E0...2%5E%7B16%7D%3D131071+%5CRightarrow+8589869056&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^0...2^{16}=131071 \\Rightarrow 8589869056")  
![2^0...2^{18}=524287 \\Rightarrow
137438691328](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E0...2%5E%7B18%7D%3D524287+%5CRightarrow+137438691328&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^0...2^{18}=524287 \\Rightarrow 137438691328")

Another way of expressing this is thus: Given a prime number
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "p") if
![M\_p=2^p-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_p%3D2%5Ep-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_p=2^p-1") is also a prime then
![P=2^{p-1}\\cdot(2^p-1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D2%5E%7Bp-1%7D%5Ccdot%282%5Ep-1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P=2^{p-1}\\cdot(2^p-1)") is a perfect number. The corresponding prime
numbers
![M\_p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_p") are today famous as the Mersenne primes. For all ![p
\<100](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3C100&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p \<100"), the following
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "p")
yield
![M\_p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_p"): 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89  
The corresponding
![M\_p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_p") are:  
3  
7  
31  
127  
8191  
131071  
524287  
2147483647  
2305843009213693951  
618970019642690137449562111

The corresponding perfect numbers are:  
6  
28  
496  
8128  
33550336  
8589869056  
137438691328

191561942608236107294793378084303638130997321548169216

These primes
![M\_p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_p") start getting huge and rare rapidly. We computed the above in a
few seconds with a modern programming language and computer. However,
some of them mark historic feats of arithmetic computation by the
unaided human brain in the pre-computer era. For instance, Leonhard
Euler computed the 8th
![M\_p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_p") (10 digits) and the corresponding perfect number. The Russian
village mathematician I.M. Pervushin went further by computing the 9th
of these numbers ( ![M\_p=
19](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_p%3D+19&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_p= 19") digits). With the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search we now
have 50 of them and the corresponding perfect numbers. This also helps
us to see why the
![M\_p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_p") always end in 1 or 7 and the corresponding perfect numbers end in
6 or 28. That the above are the only even perfect numbers was
established by Euler. Unlikely as they seem, there has been no formal
proof to show that no odd perfect numbers exist. The modern efforts also
show that the perfect numbers are rarer than what the yavana sages
thought them to be. The old Pythagorean numerologist Nicomachus states:

*“It comes about that even as fair and excellent things are few and
easily numerated, while ugly and vile ones are widespread, so also the
abundant and deficient numbers are found in great multitude and
irregularly placed – for the method of their discovery is irregular –
but the perfect numbers are easily enumerated and arranged with suitable
order; for only one is found among the units, 6, only one among the
tens, 28, and a third in the rank of the hundreds, 496 alone, and a
fourth within the limits of the thousands, that is, below ten thousand,
8128.”*

The above statement suggests that Nicomachus might have thought that for
each decade there is one perfect number. Alternatively, he might have
simply stopped counting with the greatest perfect number he knew. That
it was the former is strengthened by Platonic siddha (to use Gregory
Shaw’s term), Iamblichus, even more explicitly claiming that there is
one perfect number per decade. That, however, is clearly wrong as the
next perfect number 33550336 is in the crores. In any case the modern
confirmation of the real rarity of perfect numbers vindicates the
philosophical analogy drawn from these numbers by the yavana siddha —
the scarcity of truly perfect things as opposed to the profusion of the
supernumerary and the deficient. With respect to the easy enumeration of
the perfect numbers Nicomachus and Iamblichus likely meant Euclid’s
proposition. This rarity of perfect numbers indicates that the sum of
the reciprocals should converge to a constant:

![\\displaystyle C\_P=\\sum\_{j=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{P\_j}=
\\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{28}+\\dfrac{1}{496}+\\dfrac{1}{8128}...
\\approx
0.20452014283893...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+C_P%3D%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7BP_j%7D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B28%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B496%7D%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B8128%7D...+%5Capprox+0.20452014283893...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle C_P=\\sum_{j=1}^n \\dfrac{1}{P_j}= \\dfrac{1}{6}+\\dfrac{1}{28}+\\dfrac{1}{496}+\\dfrac{1}{8128}... \\approx 0.20452014283893...")

It would be immensely remarkable if this constant turns up somewhere in
nature.

**Abundant numbers  
**In any case, this
![C\_P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"C_P") provides a bound for the distribution of abundant numbers and
thus, brings us to the point of whether Nicomachus’ statement regarding
the abundant numbers is really so? This was what we set out to
investigate in our youth armed with a rather meager arithmetic knowledge
and a computer. Computing the first few abundant numbers yields a
sequence like below:  
12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84,
88, 90, 96, 100, 102, 104, 108, 112, 114, 120, 126, 132, 138, 140, 144,
150, 156, 160, 162, 168, 174, 176, 180, 186, 192, 196, 198, 200, 204,
208, 210, 216…

A few rules become immediately apparent:  
1\) if
![P\_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_j") is a perfect number then ![k\\cdot
P\_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5Ccdot+P_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k\\cdot P_j") is an abundant number for all ![k \\ge
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cge+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k \\ge 2"). Thus,
![P\_1=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_1%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_1=6") initiates a line of abundant numbers 12, 18, 24, 30….
![P\_2=28](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_2%3D28&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_2=28") initiates 56, 84, 112…

2\) We notice that beyond these a few abundant numbers emerge in the
interstices e.g. 20, 88 etc. A notable class of these emergent abundant
numbers are of the form ![2^k\\cdot
p\_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ek%5Ccdot+p_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^k\\cdot p_j"), where
![p\_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_j") is the
![j^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"j^{th}") odd prime and ![k \\ge
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cge+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k \\ge 2"). The first few of these are tabulated below.

![aliquot\_table1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/aliquot_table1.jpg?w=640)

These are all shown as red points in panel 1 of Figure 2. One notices
that for each jump of
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "k") we
get a jump in these abundant numbers. Of these, some like 12, 56 and 992
are already accounted for as doubles of the perfect numbers 6, 28 and
496 but the rest are distinct. Their multiples, as with the perfect
numbers, are also further abundant numbers.

3\) A few further abundant numbers emerge in the interstices, which have
a more complex description. They found new lineages of abundant numbers
as their multiples continue to be abundant numbers. The first of these
is ![70=2\\times 5 \\times
7](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=70%3D2%5Ctimes+5+%5Ctimes+7&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"70=2\\times 5 \\times 7"). 70 is the product of successive odd primes
5, 7 with 2 leaving out 3, which would yield already accounted-for
abundant numbers in a product with 2 via the perfect number 6. Another
such is ![2002=2\\times 7 \\times 11 \\times
13](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2002%3D2%5Ctimes+7+%5Ctimes+11+%5Ctimes+13&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2002=2\\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13"). Here 5 is left out because
that will again result in already accounted-for abundants in a product
with 7. Likewise, leaving out 7, we have ![1430=2\\times 5\\times
11\\times
13](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1430%3D2%5Ctimes+5%5Ctimes+11%5Ctimes+13&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1430=2\\times 5\\times 11\\times 13"). For further numbers in this
category we need the next power of 2, e.g. ![9724=2^2 \\times 11\\times
13\\times
17](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=9724%3D2%5E2+%5Ctimes+11%5Ctimes+13%5Ctimes+17&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"9724=2^2 \\times 11\\times 13\\times 17").

4\) Till
![n=1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1000") odd abundant numbers are very rare. The
![A\[232\]=945](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5B232%5D%3D945&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A[232]=945") is the first odd abundant number and till
![n=200000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D200000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=200000") there are only 391 odd abundant numbers as opposed to 49090
even abundant numbers. Of these first 391 odd ones, 387 are divisible by
15. The remaining 4 which are not namely 81081, 153153, 171171, 189189
are divisible by 9009. All odd abundant numbers necessarily need to have
the product of at least 3 distinct odd primes as a divisors. As with
other abundant numbers, the multiples of odd abundant numbers are also
abundant numbers. Based on the separation between the odd abundant
numbers, we observed that the first of them 945 is the first of a
lineage of odd abundant numbers, which are generated by the formula:
![A\_o=3 \\times
(315+210k)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_o%3D3+%5Ctimes+%28315%2B210k%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_o=3 \\times (315+210k)"), where
![k=0,1,2...51](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D0%2C1%2C2...51&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k=0,1,2...51"). Similarly, we observed that a related formula ![A\_o=11
\\times
(315+210k)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_o%3D11+%5Ctimes+%28315%2B210k%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_o=11 \\times (315+210k)"), where
![k=0,1,2...192](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D0%2C1%2C2...192&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k=0,1,2...192") produces a continuous run of 193 odd abundant numbers
starting from 3465. After
![k=51](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D51&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k=51") and
![k=192](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D192&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k=192") respectively these formulae do not necessarily produce abundant
numbers; nevertheless numbers emerging from these rules continue to
remain enriched in odd abundant numbers. Of course, the other emergent
odd abundant numbers might have further less-apparent rules. In any
case, it appears the difference between two successive odd abundant
numbers is most of the times divisible by ![2 \\times 3 \\times 5
=30](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Ctimes+3+%5Ctimes+5+%3D30&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2 \\times 3 \\times 5 =30") and always divisible by the perfect number
6.

Thus, unlike what the yavana siddha-s thought, the abundant numbers are
not entirely unruly. They have complex patterns, but can be described by
some rules. The biggest bulk of them are children of perfect numbers —
like mortal descendants of the immortal gods. This leads us to the
growth of the sequence of abundant numbers, which exhibits striking
regularity (Figure 2).

[![aliquot\_abundance\_figure2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/aliquot_abundance_figure2.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/aliquot_abundance_figure2.png)Figure
2.

Given that the sum of the reciprocals of the perfect numbers converges
to a constant
![C\_P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"C_P") and given what we have seen above regarding the abundant numbers,
they should grow at the upper bound by the equation ![y=\\tfrac{x}{C\_P}
\\approx
4.89x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D%5Ctfrac%7Bx%7D%7BC_P%7D+%5Capprox+4.89x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=\\tfrac{x}{C_P} \\approx 4.89x") (the dark red line panel 1 of Figure
2). However, since the progeny of perfect numbers are not the only
abundant numbers and several emerge by the other rules mentioned above
![A\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A[n]") should grow at a lower rate. During our initial foray into
abundant numbers, by empirical examination we thought this growth rate
might be exactly 4 (Figure 2, panel 1, light blue line). However, with
better computers and computation of 49481 abundant numbers, we later
realized that the rate was actually slightly more than 4 (Figure 2,
panel 1, dark green line). Another way of visualizing the same is by
defining the density of these numbers as the ratio of the number of
abundant numbers
![\\le](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\le") to a certain number
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n") to
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n"),

![D= \\dfrac{\\\#A\\le
n}{n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%5C%23A%5Cle+n%7D%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"D= \\dfrac{\\#A\\le n}{n}")

This is shown in Figure 2, panel 2, where we see
![D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "D")
converging to a value between 0.248 and 0.247 (red and blue lines). This
has been a topic of deep investigation in modern mathematics, starting
with the likes of Sarvadaman Chowla and Paul Erdős, and indeed the above
has proven to be the approximate bound of the density of abundant
numbers. We were quite pleased to have semi-empirically arrived at it
for ourselves. Thus, even as the odd and even numbers are distributed in
a 1:1 ratio, after initial jitters the ratio of deficient to abundant
numbers converges to a constant of ![\\approx
4.04](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+4.04&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\approx 4.04") with new lineages of abundant numbers constantly
emerging in the interstices of the established ones to maintain a linear
growth at this rate.

**The basic features of the aliquot sequences  
**The process of obtaining aliquot sums of a number
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
can be applied iteratively (the aliquot map): ![s(n)=n\_1 \\rightarrow
s(n\_1)=n\_2 \\rightarrow
s(n\_2)=n\_3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29%3Dn_1+%5Crightarrow+s%28n_1%29%3Dn_2+%5Crightarrow+s%28n_2%29%3Dn_3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(n)=n_1 \\rightarrow s(n_1)=n_2 \\rightarrow s(n_2)=n_3..."). The
sequence ![ali(n)=n, n\_1, n\_2,
n\_3...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28n%29%3Dn%2C+n_1%2C+n_2%2C+n_3...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(n)=n, n_1, n_2, n_3...") is called the aliquot sequence of
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n").
Thus, if we start with ![n=
20](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D+20&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n= 20") we get the sequence: 20, 22, 14, 10, 8, 7, 1, 0. More
generally, by computing aliquot sequences for all numbers from 1:1000,
we observe the following:  
1\) The number 1 converges in two steps to 0.  
2\) All primes converge in 3 steps, ![p, 1,
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2C+1%2C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p, 1, 0").  
3\) Perfect numbers converge in 1 step to themselves.  
4\) Certain numbers converge to a perfect number. E.g. 25, 95, 119, 143,
417, 445, 565, 675, 685, 783, 909, 913… converge to 6; 608, 650, 652,
790 converge 496. We observe that these numbers have given the
appellation “aspiring numbers”.

5\) Notably, 220 converges to 284 and 284 converges to 220.
![ali(562)=562, 284,
220](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28562%29%3D562%2C+284%2C+220&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(562)=562, 284, 220"). Thus, if from whatever starting point if one
reaches 284 or 220 one cycles between them. Such a pair is termed a pair
of amicable numbers and was probably known to Platonists as indicated by
the [heathen Sabian from Harran, Thabit ibn
Kurra](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/08/28/the-makings-of-islamic-science/)’s
knowledge of these numbers. Thabit discovered a rule to produce a
lineage of these numbers, likely drawing on the rule to generate even
perfect numbers: Let ![a=3\\cdot 2^{n-1}-1, b=3\\cdot 2^n-1, c=9\\cdot
2^{2n-1}-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D3%5Ccdot+2%5E%7Bn-1%7D-1%2C+b%3D3%5Ccdot+2%5En-1%2C+c%3D9%5Ccdot+2%5E%7B2n-1%7D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=3\\cdot 2^{n-1}-1, b=3\\cdot 2^n-1, c=9\\cdot 2^{2n-1}-1") and
![n\\ge
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Cge+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n\\ge 2"). If
![a,b,c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb%2Cc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a,b,c") are primes then we can compose the amicable pair as ![a\_1=2^n
\\cdot ab, a\_2= 2^n \\cdot
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%3D2%5En+%5Ccdot+ab%2C+a_2%3D+2%5En+%5Ccdot+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1=2^n \\cdot ab, a_2= 2^n \\cdot c"). For
![n=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=2") we get the pair 220, 284;
![n=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=4") produces 17296, 18416;
![n=7](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D7&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=7") produces the pair 9363584, 9437056. However, there are many more
amicable numbers between these pairs which cannot be captured by this
rule. For example, one can computationally show that 1184, 1210 are an
amicable pair. Long after the days of Thabit, starting from Euler down
to our times further rules have been found to capture more amicable
pairs.

6\) If perfect numbers are auto-cycles under the aliquot map, the
amicable numbers can be considered 2-cycles. While we do not know if all
higher cycles exist under the aliquot map, we can computationally find
some of them. For example the pentad 12496, 14288, 15472, 14536, 14264
constitute a 5-cycle. Any number in this pentad will cycle through these
values. Even more remarkable is this sequence 14316, 19116, 31704,
47616, 83328, 177792, 295488, 629072, 589786, 294896, 358336, 418904,
366556, 274924, 275444, 243760, 376736, 381028, 285778, 152990, 122410,
97946, 48976, 45946, 22976, 22744, 19916, 17716. These constitute a
28-cycle and any number in this 28-ad will cycle between these values.
The lowest member of a 2- and greater cycle is always an abundant
number.

7\) Still other numbers will eventually converge to an odd prime and via
that prime reach 0. There is a remarkable pattern in terms of the
preference of the prime via which convergence occurs (Figure 3). 43 is
the most preferred prime for convergence for
![n=1:1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%3A1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1:1000") (any links to [Heegner
numbers](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/03/18/euler-and-ramanujan-primes-near-integers-and-cakravala/)
or twin primes?). We are not clear as to whether this trend survives
with increasing
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n").

[![Aliquot\_convergence\_P\_figure3](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/aliquot_convergence_p_figure3.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/aliquot_convergence_p_figure3.png)Figure

8\) If we leave out the starting
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
will every other integer be reached by rest of the aliquot trajectory of
some ![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n")? We can easily provide the answer to this question as no. For
example,
![2=1+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%3D1%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2=1+1"). You cannot have two 1s as proper divisors, hence 2 can never
be reached from any other number under the aliquot map. Similarly,
![5=4+1=2+3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5%3D4%2B1%3D2%2B3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"5=4+1=2+3"). But each of these sums leading to 5 cannot be a
![s(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(n)") because we would leave out divisors 2 and 1. Thus, 5 can never
be reached from any other number under the aliquot map. On the other
hand, a number
![n=p+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3Dp%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=p+1") (where
![p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "p") is
a prime number) is never untouchable because
![s(p^2)=p+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28p%5E2%29%3Dp%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(p^2)=p+1"). Similarly, a number
![n=p\_o+3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3Dp_o%2B3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=p_o+3") (where
![p\_o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_o&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_o") is an odd prime) is never untouchable because
![s(2p\_o)=p\_o+3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%282p_o%29%3Dp_o%2B3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(2p_o)=p_o+3"). Nevertheless, some numbers are not reached easily
until one of the above configurations is encountered for the first time.
For example, ![ali(1369=37^2)= 1369, 38, 22, 14, 10, 8, 7, 1,
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%281369%3D37%5E2%29%3D+1369%2C+38%2C+22%2C+14%2C+10%2C+8%2C+7%2C+1%2C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(1369=37^2)= 1369, 38, 22, 14, 10, 8, 7, 1, 0") contains 38=37+1 for
the first time. Similarly, ![ali(2209=47^2)=2209, 48, 76, 64, 63, 41, 1,
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%282209%3D47%5E2%29%3D2209%2C+48%2C+76%2C+64%2C+63%2C+41%2C+1%2C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(2209=47^2)=2209, 48, 76, 64, 63, 41, 1, 0") contains 48=47+1 for
the first time. But the number 52 lies a in sweet spot as as neither
51=52-1 nor 49=52-3 are primes and is untouchable from any other number
under the aliquot map. These are some obvious examples of untouchability
and touchability; Erdős has shown that ultimately there are an
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\infty") of cases.

**Patterns in the convergence length of aliquot sequences  
**Are these the only convergence patterns seen in the aliquot sequences?
Is there any further pattern to the number of iterations needed to
converge? To address these questions we can define a further sequence
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]") where each element is the number of iterations taken by the
integer ![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n") to converge. The plot of
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]") for the first 1000 elements is shown in Figure 4.

![aliquot\_convergence\_l\_figure4](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/aliquot_convergence_l_figure4.png?w=640)Figure
4

The picture is quite remarkable — the majority of values are rather
pedestrian but from time to time there are huge eruptive values. The
perfect numbers (
![f\[n\]=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=1")), 1 and the primitive aspiring numbers, e.g. 25 (
![f\[n\]=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=2")), and primes (
![f\[n\]=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=3")) form the lowest values of
![f](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "f").
![f\[n\]=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]=3") might also be reached by certain secondary aspiring numbers
like 95 or 119. Of these the primes are the most common. It is quite
obvious that even numbers have significantly longer convergence paths
than odd numbers (
![p=10^{-10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3D10%5E%7B-10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p=10^{-10}"); Figure 5). We also observed that on an average the
abundant numbers have significantly longer convergence paths than the
remaining numbers ( ![p=5.3 \\times
10^{-9}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3D5.3+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-9%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p=5.3 \\times 10^{-9}") for
![n=1:1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%3A1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1:1000")). This holds even after the primes are removed from the
non-abundant numbers ( ![p= 1.9 \\times
10^{-8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3D+1.9+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p= 1.9 \\times 10^{-8}") for
![n=1:1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%3A1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1:1000")). Similarly, if we compare even abundant numbers and even
non-abundant numbers, which occur in the roughly similar counts, the
abundant even numbers still have significantly longer trajectories the
non-abundant even numbers under the aliquot map ( ![p=3.2 \\times
10^{-7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3D3.2+%5Ctimes+10%5E%7B-7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p=3.2 \\times 10^{-7}")). Due to the relative rarity of odd abundant
numbers, these effects are likely to persist beyond
![n=1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1000"). The basic statistics for the convergence trajectory lengths
for different types of numbers from
![n=1:1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%3A1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1:1000") are tabulated below and summed up in Figure 5.

During our initial foray into the first 200 terms of this sequence it
appeared that certain integers, like 138, never converged under the
aliquot map. Going on till
![n=1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1000") more such terms appeared; however, better computation showed
us that the aliquot sequences for some of these
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
indeed converge after a large number of steps after growing to monstrous
values. It was then that we learned that the mathematicians have been
studying this problem quite a bit computationally starting with Derrick
Lehmer-II (the son of the father-son pair of arithmeticians), one of the
doyens of computational mathematics. He was the first who, back in his
days after what was a tough fight, showed that
![ali(138)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)") indeed converges. For us, the hardest nut to crack for
![n=1:1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%3A1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1:1000") was
![f\[840\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5B840%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[840]"). It simply would not complete in our laptop at home even after
running it for over a day with an efficient divisor finding function.
Nor did it complete on our primary work station used for most of routine
computations. Then we had to bring out our Indrāstra, a 120 core machine
that we use for big things. For that we had to first write a
multi-threaded version, which was run on 100 cores of this machine and
it completed

![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

families, all of which are abundant numbers descending from 6. After the

convergence. The final prime via which they converge is termed

One notices that families
![f\_{138}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B138%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f_{138}") and
![f\_{858}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B858%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f_{858}") have a higher-order relationship because they converge via
59. However, we keep them as different families for, barring the last 8
elements of
![ali(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(n)"), they followed very different trajectories (Figure 6). Their
![p\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_c") is the 6th most common
![p\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_c") for
![n=1:1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%3A1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1:1000"), with 45 numbers converging via it (Figure 3). However, 12
of them being monster values it is one
![p\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_c") over-represented in the aliquot sequences attaining monster
values. In contrast, the most common
![p\_c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p_c") in this range 43 (Figure 3) has only a single monster value (936)
in this range.
![ali(840)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28840%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(840)") shows the most monstrous behavior in this range (Figure 6).
It reaches a maximum value of the behemoth number:
3463982260143725017429794136098072146586526240388. I felt please on
reaching this number and experiencing the magnificence of
![ali(840)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28840%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(840)") for myself. After that it remains in the high range for
while with two prominent peaks before converging after 749 steps. Such a
behavior, with a multiplicity of peaks before convergence, is also seen
in the other monstrous families (Figure 6).

We wondered if there was any features of these sequences, which allowed
their eruptive growth before finally converging. We observed the
following:  
1\) They start as even abundant numbers, which means that they are
statistically in the general group of numbers which are going to have
longer trajectories to convergence.  
2\) Their trajectories tend to remain even, which again increases their
probability of having a long convergence path. By specifically studying
the first major eruptive case
![ali(138)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)"), we see that it has a convergence trajectory of length 179.
It remains even from
![ali(138)\[1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29%5B1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)[1]") to
![ali(138)\[175\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29%5B175%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)[175]"). Thus, remaining even is a key factor for a long
convergence path.  
3\) The next key feature observation regarding their growth came from
examining the behavior of the first two cases which show above average
behavior. These are
![f(30)=16](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%2830%29%3D16&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f(30)=16") and
![f(102)=19](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28102%29%3D19&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f(102)=19"). First, both are even abundant numbers satisfying the above
condition. Then we note their behavior under the aliquot map:  
![ali(30)=30, 42, 54, 66, 78, 90, 144, 259, 45, 33, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1,
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%2830%29%3D30%2C+42%2C+54%2C+66%2C+78%2C+90%2C+144%2C+259%2C+45%2C+33%2C+15%2C+9%2C+4%2C+3%2C+1%2C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(30)=30, 42, 54, 66, 78, 90, 144, 259, 45, 33, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1, 0")  
![ali(102)=102, 114, 126, 186, 198, 270, 450, 759, 393, 135, 105, 87,
33, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1,
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28102%29%3D102%2C+114%2C+126%2C+186%2C+198%2C+270%2C+450%2C+759%2C+393%2C+135%2C+105%2C+87%2C+33%2C+15%2C+9%2C+4%2C+3%2C+1%2C+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(102)=102, 114, 126, 186, 198, 270, 450, 759, 393, 135, 105, 87, 33, 15, 9, 4, 3, 1, 0")  
We see that both of them have a run of 7 continuous abundant numbers,
which are multiples of the perfect number 6. This allows a monotonic
increase. When they lose this divisor 6 in the 8th iteration they become
odd and start falling rapidly and converge. We then looked if this
pattern might play out in a truly eruptive example by taking the case of
![ali(138)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)"). We see that from
![ali(138)\[1\]=138](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29%5B1%5D%3D138&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)[1]=138") to
![ali(138)\[30\]=1467588](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29%5B30%5D%3D1467588&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)[30]=1467588"), then
![ali(138)\[65\]=19406148](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29%5B65%5D%3D19406148&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)[65]=19406148") to
![ali(138)\[72\]=348957876](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29%5B72%5D%3D348957876&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)[72]=348957876") and again
![ali(138)\[95\]=1013592](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29%5B95%5D%3D1013592&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)[95]=1013592") to
![ali(138)\[117\]=100039354704](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29%5B117%5D%3D100039354704&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)[117]=100039354704") each number is a multiple of the perfect
number 6. The repeated generation of a multiple of a perfect number
under the aliquot map means there can be stretches of unhindered growth
with one abundant number succeeding the previous one until that perfect
number is lost among the divisors. It is the final loss of 6 and then 2
among the divisors that allows
![ali(138)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28138%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(138)") to converge. In making these observations we had
recapitulated Lehmer’s key findings in the context of the growth of the
most mysterious class of aliquot sequences we shall talk about next.

There are 12
![f\[n\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Bn%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f[n]"), for ![n \\le
1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cle+1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n \\le 1000"), which could not be determined because the corresponding
![ali(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(n)") never converged in our computation (the blue dots in Figure
4). A search on the Internet reveals that deep computational efforts by
various investigators have not seen an end to these sequences. They
belong to 5 families which are known after Lehmer-II who first studied
them. Within each family (listed below), after the first few terms the
evolution converges to the same trajectory (Figure 7). These families
are:  
![f\_{276}=276, 306, 396,
696](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B276%7D%3D276%2C+306%2C+396%2C+696&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

All these numbers are abundant numbers descending from 6, which is a
tendency they share with the above monster numbers that eventually
converge. The frequencies of their largest prime factors are tabulated
below:

Notably, in this set except
![f\_{564}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B564%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f_{564}"), 4 of the five families have a member with 23 as the highest
prime factor. It is now conjectured by mathematicians that these define
the founding members of a class of aliquot sequences that would never
converge but eventually shoot off to infinity. Examining the eruptive
growth of these sequences, we found that the same features that cause
the eruptive growth of the converging but monster
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
hold true here too. Thus, if we consider the first case
![ali(276)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28276%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(276)"), which starts with a double of the first monster
![n=178](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D178&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=178"), we notice that it starts off well with the perfect number 6 as
the divisor for the first 5 terms successive terms —
![ali(276)\[1\]=276](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28276%29%5B1%5D%3D276&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(276)[1]=276") to
![ali(276)\[5\]=1872](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28276%29%5B5%5D%3D1872&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(276)[5]=1872"). But then the sequence loses 6 in the 6th term a
stutters for a few terms even going down from the high point it reached.
But then in
![ali(276)\[9\]=2716](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28276%29%5B9%5D%3D2716&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(276)[9]=2716") it acquires a new perfect number divisor 28, which
drives the abundance of successive terms until the it reaches the giant
28 digit
![ali(276)\[170\]=7165455981799192761913565252](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28276%29%5B170%5D%3D7165455981799192761913565252&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(276)[170]=7165455981799192761913565252"). Lehmer’s study was the
first which noted the role of such persistent divisors in driving up the
aliquot sequences. Accordingly, the grand old man of arithmeticians,
Richard Guy, called these ‘drivers’ and in addition to 2 and the perfect
numbers defined a few more of such. What seems to happen is that in
these apparently non-converging aliquot sequences the drivers drive the
growth to some large number after which they are lost. But before the
sequence can crash by attaining an odd number, a new driver emerges and
pushes up its growth again. Thus, these sequences might not converge. On
the other hand the case of the monstrous
![ali(840)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ali%28840%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"ali(840)") with
![f=749](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3D749&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f=749") tells us that even after many such runs there is some chance of
hitting a number, which brings you crashing down though its even almost
all the way through. Whatever the case, the aliquot sequence of these
non-converging numbers tell us that there are several more numbers in
their trajectories, which would similarly not converge. Hence,
non-convergence will be encountered frequently as the starting numbers
get large.

In conclusion, following along the lines of the ancients, we find that
the aliquot sequences offer us some philosophical lessons and
mysteries:  
1\) There is the predictable: The primes and perfects display very
predictable and uniform behavior.  
2\) There is the somewhat predictable: like the amicable numbers, for
some of which a rule was found as early as Thabit ibn Kurra. But not all
of them can be captured by an easy rule.  
3\) There is the statistically tendency: We know that an even or
abundant number is more likely to have a longer path to convergence
though it is not clear at all if any rule can say which of them might be
monstrous and which rather common place.  
4\) There is the unpredictable and mysterious: Why are some numbers
“aspiring numbers” which converge to a perfect number? Is there any
rule to describe them? Why is 43 the preferred prime for convergence at
least for
![n=1:1000](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1%3A1000&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1:1000"). Why do some numbers not converge? Can we predict which
numbers will not converge? Do they really not converge at all? As far as
I know these remain unanswered. Thus, a very simple arithmetic process
gives rise to a whole range of unexpected behavior.
