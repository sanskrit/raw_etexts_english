The Albanians are speakers of an isolate of the Indo-European family,
the Albanian language. Surrounded by Slavs & Greeks, sharing a sea
border with Romance speakers. We can be sure of a few things, namely
that their language and presumably ethnic origin is from a Paleo-Balkan
people autochonous to the peninsula, but certainly incorporating an
Indo-European element on a layer of indigeneous farmer substratum.  
  
By Paleo-Balkan, we refer to IE languages spoken in the region before
the Slavic migrations of the 6-7th century replaced most of them
linguistically. (Roman conquest also led to the creation of large chunks
of Latin speakers in early and late antiquity). Some of these Romans
still survive, in the form of the Moldovans and Romanians. Coming back
to Paleo-Balkan – this category is chiefly made up of 3 candidates,
Thracian, Illyrian or Dacian.  
  
Now, there is indeed geographical continuity with modern-day Albanians
and Illyrians. This might be able to explain some Illyrian toponyms
through the laws of sound changes. (Durrachion (Illyr) \> Durres (Alb)
or Aulona (Illyr) \> Vlone (Alb)). One can also look at the Greco-Roman
loan words in Albanian, (all pre-christian) and trace their evolution.
There are 33 Greek loan words in Alb (admittedly not a lot) but well
over 600 from Latin. Namely, the Greek loans have to be from West-Greek
or Doric due to no evience of the recorded ā>ē sound shift of
Attic/Ionic.  
  
mākhanā ‘millstone’ (doric) \> moker (Alb)  
drapanon ‘sickle’ (doric) \> draper (Alb)

We can see that Albanians being on the SWest of the Balkans is a better
explanation of receiving both Greek and Latin loans than in the East
(Thracian). Not only that, but 600+ pre-christian Latin loan words must
reflect a relatively early integration. This kind of adds up with the
Illyrians being the earliest ones to be conquered by the Romans (3rd
century BCE). Coming to the ethnonym, Albanian conclusively comes from a
name for an Illyrian tribe called Albanoi (attested so by Ptolemy).
Albanian was also the name used for the tongue when the language was
first documented in the 13th century CE in a legal document from Raguza
(cf – audivi unam vocem clamantem in monte in lingua **albanesca**). We
do run into one issue here, namely that the modern ethnonym of the
Albanians for themselves and their tongue is shqiptar (Albanian) from
the root shqip-  
This root forms a denominative verb, shqiptoj “to talk clearly” ,
similar but opposite to the saṃskṛtam verb mlecchati “to talk
indistinctively” from √mlecch and hence the term mleccha “barbarian”  
  
Admittedly, scholars think this was a recent shift in ethnonym as the
same land has been called Albanoi in Byzantine and Roman sources since
antiquity, is this shift possibly due to the Ottoman Invasion (more
emphasis on people who talk clearly? speak Albanian without Turkish?).
The saving grace for this comes from Albanian speakers who migrated to
Italy right when the Ottoman Invasion happened who still call themselves
arberesh from the root alb/arb. This indicates the original ethnonym
which must have stood ground in all of Albania before the 1600s.  
  
While the Greek loan words are few, they are certainly pre-Koine. This
is indicative of the reconstructed loans having the aspirate /kʰ/
instead of the fricative /x/ of Koine. And the aspirate /tʰ/ (cf – tha
in saṃskṛta) instead of the dental fricative /th/ (as in ‘the’) of
Koine.  
  
lakhanon (Doric) \> laker (Alb)  
thaurakion (Doric) \> targoze (Alb)  
  
Stacking the evidence up, there seems to be a very strong case for
Illyrian origins.  
1) Linguistic isolate, (Paleo Balkan)  
2) Explains Illyrian toponyms via sound change of Albanian  
3) Ethnonym being of an Illyrian tribe (Albanian)  
4) Geographical continuity  
5) Pre Christian, Pre Koine West Greek + Latin loan words  
6) Albanian ethnonym preserved in Arbershe (Italian Albanians)  
  
I concurr, going by Occam’s Razor, Albanians are likely descendants of
the Paleo-Balkan race of Illyrians that were pushed out of most of
Illyria by modern Montenegrins, Bosno-Serbo-Croatians & Macedonians to
their present geography. Sure, some arguments like lack of massive Greek
loan words or lack of seafaring vocabulary could be made, but going as
we are by uncertainties, the arguments in a pro are more.  
  
Genetic studies on the Illyrians identified to a certain archaeological
horizon and other Paleo-Balkan people with updated results on the Y-DNA
haplogroups of Albanians would clear things up.
