## XCV

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

*July 7, 1896*

DEAR MOTHER —

\[On the\] 18th of this month I start for Switzerland for a holiday. I
will come back to London again to work in the Autumn. The work in
England bids fair to be much better and deeper than in the U.S. And here
in London is the heart of India also. Where are you now? I am passing
through Geneva on my way to the Hills. I will be there a day or two.

If you be somewhere near, I will make it a point to come to see you. Did
you hear Annie Besant? How did you like her? What about your plans of
going to India next winter? What about the innocents (Mary and Harriet
Hale and Isabelle and Harriet McKindley.) at home? I haven't had any
news of them. My love to Father Pope, Mother Temple (Mrs. James
Matthews, Mr. Hale's sister.) and yourself. Kindly answer as I will be
only a few days here.

Ever yours with love and gratitude,  
VIVEKANANDA
