C/O G. W. HALE, ESQ.,  
CHICAGO, U.S.A.

DEAR GOVINDA SAHAY,

 

Do you keep any correspondence with my Gurubhâis of Calcutta? Are you
progressing morally, spiritually, and in your worldly affairs? . . .
Perhaps you have heard how for more than a year I have been preaching
Hindu religion in America. I am doing very well here. Write to me as
soon as you can and as often as you like. 

Yours with love,

VIVEKANANDA.
