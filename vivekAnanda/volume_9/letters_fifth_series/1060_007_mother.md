## VII

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

MINNEAPOLIS

*21 November 1893*

DEAR MOTHER,

I reached Madison safely, went to a hotel, and sent a message to Mr.
Updike. He came to see me. He is a Congregational and so, of course, was
not very friendly at first; but in the course of an hour or so became
very kind to me, and took me over the whole place and the University. I
had a fine audience and $100. Immediately after the lecture I took the
night train to Minneapolis.

I tried to get the clergymen's ticket, but they could not give me any,
not being the headquarters. The thing to be done is to get a permit from
every head office of every line in Chicago. Perhaps it is possible for
Mr. Hale to get the permits for me. If it is so, I hope he will take the
trouble to send them over to me to Minneapolis if they can reach me by
the 25th, or to Des Moines if by the 29th. Else I would do it the next
time in Chicago. I have taken the money in a draft on the bank, which
cost me 40¢.

May you be blessed for ever, my kind friend; you and your whole family
have made such a heavenly impression on me as I would carry all my life.

Yours sincerely,  
VIVEKANANDA
