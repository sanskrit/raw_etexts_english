I’ve had this image – and its underlying sentiment – on my mind for a
few days now. It’s something that often comes up in Western (neo-)pagan
circles, and represents multiple layers of fundamental misapprehension
about Indo-European religion.  
Indeed, it is very much a modern take – reflective of modern prejudices,
(mis-)perceptions, and hangups – masquerading as something more
archaic.

The core conceit of the meme is not merely that bowing to a God is
somehow inappropriate – that’s a mere exterior symptom of its problem.
No, what it’s seeking to get across is the bizarre ideathat one should
think of one’s self as ‘equal’ in some sense, to the Gods. That worship
and piety is a social occasion like going drinking with friends – peers
– rather than an engagement with, and in service of, immensely powerful
beings above us; and that an overt and respectful acknowledgement of the
rather immense differential between a human and a God renders one
somehow less than a man – a ‘slave’, in fact.

Now, as it happens, the notion of “drink\[ing\] with mine!” referenced
in the lower panel of the meme … isn’t actually all that far removed
from how we *do* indeed conduct various forms of rite and
operationalized piety – but more upon that, how it’s easily reconciled
with the proper and honouring acknowledgement of Divinity, (and how it’s
rather different from a casual cold one with the boys) in due course.

To return to the top panel – the image starts straight-away with some
insistent framing of things. It claims “slaves kneel to their God”, and
has what I presume to be Muslims performing ‘sujud’ along with what may
be modern Christians bowing slightly. The message in its inferency –
that bowing, whether fully or even only slightly at the waist, is
“un-pagan”, is “Abrahamic”, and is something that only a slave (i.e. one
less than a man, with no capacity for will nor honour) would engage in.
And all of this is patently false.

As I have said countless times before, simply because something may so
happen to look like something in an Abrahamic faith does not make it
exclusive thereto. We have had people claim that the idea of holy books,
proper priests, liturgy, and any number of other things are only or
exclusively Abrahamic – and that even talking about such things in an
Indo-European religious context is supposedly the result of an
insidiously intended creeping Christianization. Which has always struck
me as absolutely bizarre, as we Hindus have had holy books, ordained
priests, liturgy, etc. etc. for literal millennia before Christ or
Catholicism, for a start.

The reason that some people often have these sorts of hang-ups is
because they are coming at things from a Western and Christian-dominated
religious sphere. They want to react angrily against that paradigm – and
instead of actually engaging with the Indo-European religious sphere for
what it *is*, upon its own terms … they wind up simply defining
themselves in opposition to what they are rebelling against. And
therefore, not at all coincidentally, resiling from various features
that are pretty integral to the Indo-European faiths (or, indeed, almost
any large-scale and enduring religion) because to them … well, much that
is just generally a feature of ‘religion’ instead looks quite
specifically “Abrahamic” and therefore ‘foreign’.

In truth, what is ‘foreign’ to various of these sorts is something
entirely different. Namely, the notion that they, themselves, are not
the exclusive, explicit, damn well solipsistic center of the universe.
Whether we choose to acknowledge it or not, much of the modernist,
liberal, post-enlightenment progression of our cultural psychology tends
to push this concept. We have gone, as a civilization, from having
Cosmic Order and Gods at the center of everything (quite mytho-literally
as it happens – see my various works on the Axis Mundi concept, and the
personified / deific expressions thereof, as well as its active
weaponization in the World-Spear), through to having not so much a more
‘materialist’ conception of things, as an anthropocentric one. The
pseudo-transcendentalist idea that Man, Mankind is at the center. And,
from there, in lieu of Men – in the pointed plural – society,
civilization … the atomized individual *within* that sphere, a literal
*self-conception*, becomes our foundational grund-norm for viewing the
cosmos. We are, seemingly, besotted with our own magnificence. “Where
the Falling Angel met the Rising Ape”, indeed .. and even the ‘falling
angel’ bit implies an elevation of the human soul and subject precisely
due to a rebellious rejection of one’s superior. Certainly, it is
absolutely uncoincidental that we find in the various forms of either
‘ironic’ or deadly serious demon-worshippers of our age (for instance,
the atheistic and Ayn Rand with (Anti-)Catholic aesthetics ‘LaVeyan
Satanism’ .. or various of the *actual* and intentional malefic cults
out there that I shall not name, respectively), such a strong emphasis
upon exactly this exaltation of the individual as the center of their
own universe and anything above as patently ‘false’.

Now, the sort of mentality encapsulated in the meme is not *quite* that
– at least, not directly. It is prepared to acknowledge Gods, but only
provided that They are ‘brought down to our level’ in some sense.
Engaged with, as the meme’s creator is quite unembarrassed to tell you,
in the manner of a ‘drinking-buddy’.

This is a curious approach, and one which immediately reminded me of
something which used to be said in politics about an electable leader
with the ‘common touch’. The sort whom an ordinary voter could
comfortably say “I could see myself grabbing a beer with that guy” – or,
with a certain level of celebrity and charisma, perhaps “I *would like*
to get a beer with that guy!”

While it is certainly the case that some sovereigns of the past have
enjoyed and enjoined quite close relationships with their people, I am
not quite sure that the notion of regularly going drinking with the King
(or, for that matter, Queen) has historically been a feature of many of
them. Even then, being invited to the court of a noble was a big deal –
and an occasion wherein one did not exactly engage with him as an equal
unless one *actually was* of something at least approaching equal
station. A matter, surely, of simple common sense – if you’re
petitioning somebody of greater power for patronage and assistance, it
is a bold man indeed who would brusquely cast aside the proper etiquette
or at least some measure of the outward manifestations of respect for at
least the office if not always its immediate holder.

Perhaps we might tentatively suggest that the seeming
over-representation of Americans when it comes to the sort of sentiment
smacked of in this meme, is because that country has so proudly been
‘republican’ – and not in the archaic sense, but in the general idea
that the people with political power are almost ‘temporary’, only there
due to the support of those below, and basically of the same stuff as
those who have voted for them. It is a comforting way to mask the fact
that for some years, some decades now, dynasties – literal, familial
dynasties – have increasingly become the norm for high office there; and
that representatives appear often drawn from a technocratic-managerial
caste (or at least, with significant backing therefrom) rather than
‘ordinary people’. Which should never be confused for suggesting those
elites are ‘better’ than those they lord over – although this is quite
rapidly heading down a digression that is worth another rant in the
future. I should hasten to add that while there is a frequency to some
Americans holding the kind of attitudes declared in the meme, this is by
no means representative of all Americans – there are many amidst the
millions of that great land who have decidedly alternate and more
appropriate views, and I have no wish to tarnish them all via the same
political association.

Nor, lest I be misunderstood, am I seeking to comment overtly in favour
of *human* monarchy – or, for that matter, any other human political
system and its incumbents. The perhaps surprising underlying
Indo-European mytho-politics of such things, we may leave to another
time. For our focus here is to be upon the Gods and our relationship
with Them. And, by definition, when we are orienting around Gods and the
saliency of the Divine in our world – we are engaging with something far
more, both by degree as well as kind, than mere ‘human’.

Which does not mean that there is no essential link between Them and us,
of course. As we have capaciously illustrated elsewhere, the
Indo-European Man is a ‘Son of the Sun’ – we are, quite
(mytho-)literally of ‘divine descent’. And to my mind, it has long
seemed that that makes our position in the cosmos far more marvel-worthy
(and most definitely not Marvel-worthy) than the counterpoint insistence
that we might be in any meaningful way ‘equal’ to our betters, the
Divine. It also renders the situation of Gods coming down amongst us to
feast and drink with us – as, again, is quite an archaic Indo-European
fundament of rites and metaphysical operationalization of piety – even
more remarkable for precisely this reason. After all, a social encounter
with one’s friends is one thing – a positive and pleasant experience, to
be lauded and encouraged; a social encounter with family is likewise –
and even more of a direct and overt duty precisely because the bonds of
blood are so integral to who and what we are. Yet to have the
magnificence of Divinity descend to treat with us – well, it is of such
incredible impression and impressiveness precisely because it is *not*
and never can be a ‘meeting of equals’. Familiarity is said to breed
contempt in some – reverence and wonderment, meanwhile, the constant
‘re-enchantment of the world’, is to be found more aptly in properly
considering the immense distance between ‘there’ and ‘here’. But again,
I digress.

Now, when these debates come up in earnest around something as simple as
bowing before a God – we inevitably find people objecting upon the basis
of a rather skewed (mis-)understanding of history and scripture (yes,
Indo-European religions have scripture – almost as if this is rather
important as a feature of an enduring tradition spanning thousands of
years or something). It seems almost customary to cite the opposition of
the Macedonians to Alexander’s attempt to institute the Persianate
custom ofProskynesis – and thence extrapolate from there that the
objection of these Greeks to engaging with their ruler as if he were a
God, ought mean that the Greeks were simultaneously opposed to engaging
with their actual Gods in anything even vaguely reminiscent of such a
manner.

A moment’s consideration ought reveal the essential fallacy to that
attempted equation.

Especially when we consider some of the actual textual evidence of the
Classical world itself upon such matters –

Here’s Xenophon, in his Anabasis: “Again, when Xerxes at a later time
gathered together that countlesshost and came against Greece, then too
our forefathers were victorious, both by land and by sea, over the
forefathers of our enemies. As tokens of these victories we may, indeed,
still behold the trophies, but the strongest witness to them is the
freedom of the states in which you were born and bred; for to no human
creature do you pay homage as master, but to the gods alone.”

Now, the words which have been rendered there as “pay homage” – in the
original Greek, it is προσκυνεῖτε. Proskyneíte. That is to say,
‘Proskynesis’ – invoked here as something inappropriate when engaging
with a mortal human as a master … but most *definitely* appropriate as
applies our relationship to The Gods. Indeed, quite pointedly held here
as the essence-tial element which enabled the Greeks to triumph and
*remain* free – although this becomes clearer when parsing Xenophon’s
speech in its full length, something we do not have the space to do here
for now.

There’s another occurrence for Proskynesis to be found in that same
chapter of the Anabasis, of course – and it is rather more famous. I
shall again quote the words of Xenophon:

“‘\[…\] but if our intention is to rely upon our arms, and not only to
inflict punishment upon them for their past deeds, but henceforth to
wage implacable war with them, we have—the gods willing—many fair hopes
of deliverance.’  
As he was saying this a man sneezed, and when the soldiers heard it,
they all with one impulse made obeisance to the god; and Xenophon said,
“I move, gentlemen, since at the moment when we were talking about
deliverance an omen from Zeus the Saviour was revealed to us, that we
make a vow to sacrifice to that god thank-offerings for deliverance as
soon as we reach a friendly land; and that we add a further vow to make
sacrifices, to the extent of our ability, to the other gods also. All
who are in favour of this motion,” he said, “will raise their hands.”
And every man in the assembly raised his hand. Thereupon they made their
vows and struck up the paean.”

Now, to explicate what has occurred there – at the moment that Xenophon
uttered that word, ‘Deliverance’, ‘σωτηρία’ (‘Soteria’), ‘Ten Thousand’
hardened Greek warriors fell to their knees. The reasoning being that it
was felt that Zeus the Savior – Zeus Soteria – had sent an omen of their
impending deliverance from the most perilous circumstances they now
found themselves immersed amidst. Why a sneeze? Why should a sneeze form
such a potent portent? I do not know – although one thing I can say for
certain is that when thousands of Greek soldiers immediately all bow as
a result of it, that is most certainly no ordinary sneeze!

Xenophon’s speech then takes as its theme the aforementioned situation
of the Greeks having historically triumphed against the hostile Persians
who sought to render them serfs – thanks to the Availment of the Gods,
and the powerful metaphysical forces at play in those conflicts for
which they were justly thankful. The serious and ornate ritual
understandings enjoined there are quite at odds with this notion of just
casually going drinking with divinity.

Another term which is perhaps relevant is the Ancient Greekἱκεσῐ́ᾱ
/ἱκετείᾱ (‘hiketeia’ / ‘hikesia’) andἱκᾱ́νω (‘hikano’) – effectively,
‘supplication’, and ‘to approach \[as a supplicant\]’, respectively
(ἱκετεύω (‘hiketeuo’) – ‘to beg’ – is also closely related). These are
gestures that are found as far back as the Iliad (i.e. as far back as
the Ancient Greek mythological canon really goes, textually speaking),
and tend to involve … well, ‘going low’ before the God being approached.
‘Crouching’, touching the knees of the power being supplicated, and
other such associated elements are quite pointedly referenced. Although
whereas Proskynesis is intended to be more toward the ‘general act of
recognition and piety’ end of things, the hiketeia is instead connoted
as a more specific call for aid or forgiveness.

There are, of course, quite numerous further examples which could be
drawn from in both the Greek and Roman textual spheres – but I think
that I have made my point here. I shall also not expand upon the
comparative elements found in Hinduism – although suffice to say that,
once again, we find clear resonancies between the Classical and the
Hindu understandings (for example, the concept of Pranam – literally
‘bending forward’ in honouring).

Now, in terms of the “I drink with mine!” understanding – as I have
said, there is some level of truth to this, however it is important to
situate it within its proper context and differentiate it from simply a
social encounter with casual acquaintance. Although having said that, it
is intriguing to note that an offering of food and liquid sustenance to
the visitor, the guest, as part of the custom of ‘Xenia’ \[‘Sacred
Hospitality’\] *can* most definitely become ‘drinking with the Divine’
in those occasions wherein a certain wandering and disguised God has
come amongst His People to test their adherence to the proper customs.
We see this with, for instance, Zeus (and Hermes) amidst the Greeks,
with Odin (as Grimnir – the Hooded/Masked One, aptly enough) visiting
the unfortunate king Geirroth, and with Shiva as the AdiVratyain the
relevant AtharvaVeda hymnals, to phrase but a few occurrences of this
general Indo-European typology.

Of prominent interest for us within the Classical comparanda is the
situation of Demeter (indeed, potentially Demeter Erinyes – albeit
disguised, certainly with Her Divine Countenance ‘darkened’ in some
sense if not the other) coming to Eleusis and being well-received by a
family there. This is not only ‘Xenia’ in tangible action – but due to
what then ensues (the demi-deification of Triptolemos via a provision of
what appears reasonably resonant with our Vedic understanding of Soma,
Amrit via empowered milk), we see the ‘Do Ut Des’ understanding of
Indo-European piety in action. ‘Do Ut Des’, as I have covered elsewhere,
meaning ‘I Give \[That\] You Might Give’; and here representing the
extension of proper propitiation, indeed ‘libation’ we may suggest and
most certainly ‘oblation’ … being ‘replied to’ by the Divinity with
something wondrous. A mixture of milk and honey provided to Demeter in
that specific mythic occurrence, is replied to with *Her* Milk, which
renders the infant Triptolemus more than a man.

The way this is generally approached is via the construal of this as
‘Guest Worship’ – not so much in the sense of ‘Xenia’ as the specific
duty to visitors who might turn out to be Gods, although to this it is
irreducibly linked – but rather, as the invoking of Gods to come and
join us humans for a feast in Their Honour. In which, yes, we too eat
and drink – although it is only respectful that They get first (and
best) share (subject to, in the Hindu understanding at least, the notion
that the way that the Gods eat of the sustenance provided is via
metaphysical means … which thence imbues the physical forms of the food
with Their blessing, which is imbued into us when we then literally eat
it. The concept of ‘Prasad’).

I shall quote a rather excellent summation by Professor Michael Witzel
by way of synopsis:

“In short, the Vedic gods are ceremoniously invited (avahana) to the
offering ground (vedi), seated on the grass strewn around the fires
(barhis), feasted with a meal (havis) of food and drink, which is
accompanied by poems, some of which are sung (stotra), lauding them and
their great deeds (mantra, sastra). The gods are then sent off – until
next time. The parting gift, however, is given to the priest (as
dakshina), not to the departing guests. \[ C.A.R.: actually, this is not
quite accurate – the notion is that the Priest here is representing the
God(s), and so therefore, yes, yes the Dakshina \[‘righteous conduct’ –
from same root as European ‘Dexter’\] is indeed being given to the
departing Guests … and it is also intriguing to consider the
‘Guest’/’Geist’ coterminity in the relevant Germanic linguistics … which
we have done elsewhere \[-C.A.R.\] \]

This might sound like a description of a modern puja; the basic
structure, in fact, is the same, and it is even sometimes recognized as
a structure of guest friendship by modern Hindus (Ostor 1982). Though a
puja can comprise 16 or 36, in Bhaktapur even 60 (639), sets of actions,
its most basic structure still is: first, avahana (‘driving here,’ or
even akarsana, ‘drawing close,’ in Tantra); second, worship with food
(stotra/stuti), and the giving of a gift; and third, visarjana, the
‘sending away’ ceremony. The return gift of the gods, the
ucchista/prasada, is applied by the performer of the puja, be it a
private person or a priest, in the form of a tilaka on the forehead of
the worshipper. In accordance with one possible etymology of the word
puja (Mayrhofer 1953-80), the unstudied history of this act seems to go
back to a smearing of the blood of the victim (Witzel n.d.a.), \[C.A.R.:
While speculative – Witzel would appear to be on some rather solid
ground here; one of my colleagues has alerted me to a Sri Ramakrishna
commentary that appears to substantiate the supposition being made – at
least, in terms of a relatively recent Tilaka practice which is thusly
congealed in the blood of the sacrificial offering. \[-C.A.R.\] \]
Interestingly, the very word is not, as has often been supposed, a
post-Vedic loan or innovation; it is attested in the RigVeda (Witzel
1980b), though in an unclear context.

The guest or the god is supposed to return the favour by a
counter-invitation (to heaven) or by a more substantial return gift
(rain, for example, or children). Even then, the cycle of giving and
taking is kept in progress, as the exact amount of gift and counter-gift
is difficult to measure and evaluate. Humans give, the gods give back,
to a degree, and the humans have to give again. The Stone Age mentality
(Sahlins 1972) of do ut des (‘I give, so that you might give’) applies
to the Veda (dehi me, dadami te, ‘give me, I give you’; TS 1.8. 4.1, VS
3.50) and modern puja as well.”

For reasons that ought be obvious, enjoinments extending such an
invitation to come to the Feast are especially prominent in various
RigVedic Hymnals dedicated to Agni. This is the case as the fire and its
ignition forms a key foundational stage to Vedic rites, and Agni as
Herald and Conduit of the Gods is quite integral to Their Calling (the
act of the Hotar – ‘priest/caller’).

For instance, from RigVeda VI 16:

“6 Do thou, Immortal Messenger, bring hither the Celestial Folk;  
Hearing the singer’s eulogy.  
7 Mortals with pious thought implore Thee, Agni, God, at holy rites,  
To come unto the feast of Gods.  
8 I glorify Thine aspect and the might of Thee the Bountiful.  
All those who love shall joy in Thee,  
9 Invoker placed by Manus, Thou, Agni, art near, the wisest Priest:  
Pay worship to the Tribes of Heaven.  
10 Come, Agni, lauded, to the feast; come to the offering of the
gifts.  
As Priest be seated on the grass.”

RV V 20:

“3 Thee, Agni, would we choose as Priest, the perfecter of strength and
skill;  
We who bring sacred food invoke with song Thee Chief at holy rites.  
4 Here as is needful for Thine aid we toil, O Conqueror, day by day,  
For wealth, for Law. May we rejoice, Most Wise One! at the feast, with
kine, rejoice, with heroes, at the feast.”

RV V 26:

“1 O Agni, Holy and Divine, with splendour and Thy pleasant tongue  
Bring hither and adore the Gods.  
2 We pray Thee, Thou who droppest oil, bright-rayed! who lookest on the
Sun,  
Bring the Gods hither to the feast.  
3 We have enkindled Thee, O Sage, bright caller of the Gods to feast.  
O Agni, great in Sacrifice.  
4 O Agni, come with all the Gods, come to our sacrificial gift:  
We choose Thee as Invoking Priest.  
5 Bring, Agni, to the worshipper who pours the juice, heroic strength:  
Sit with the Gods upon the grass.  
6 Victor of thousands, Agni, Thou, enkindled, cherishest the laws,  
Laud-worthy, envoy of the Gods.  
7 Set Agni Jātavedas down, the bearer of our sacred gifts,  
Most Youthful, God and Minister.  
8 Duly proceed our sacrifice, comprising all the Gods, to-day:  
Strew holy grass to be their seat.  
9 So may the Maruts sit thereon, the Aśvins, Mitra, Varuṇa:  
The Gods with all Their company.”

RV III 24:

“2 Lit with libation, Agni, Thou, deathless, Who callest Gods to
feast,  
Accept our sacrifice with joy.”

RV X 53 \[slightly broader than an Agni hymnal, to be sure\]:

“1 He hath arrived, He Whom we sought with longing, Who skilled in
sacrifice well knows its courses.  
Let Him discharge his sacrificial duties: let Him sit down as Friend who
was before Us.  
2 Best Priest, He hath been won by being seated, for He hath looked on
the well-ordered viands.  
Come, let us worship Gods Who must be worshipped, and pouring oil, laud
those Who should be lauded.  
3 Now hath He made the feast of Gods effective: now have we found the
secret tongue of worship.  
Now hath He come, sweet, robed in vital vigour, and made our calling on
the Gods effective.”

RV IV 3 \[interestingly, an Agni hymnal beginning with a Rudra
invocation – for, after all, Agni is Rudra\]:

“13 Go never to the feast of one who harms us, the treacherous neighbour
or unworthy kinsman.  
Punish us not for a false brother’s trespass. Let us not feel the might
of friend or foeman.”

Although it is hardly an exclusive association to Agni’s Hymnals –

RV I 102:

“1To Thee the Mighty One I bring this mighty hymn, for Thy desire hath
been gratified by my laud.  
In Indra, yea in Him victorious through His strength, the Gods have
joyed at feast and when the Soma flowed.”

RV VIII 3:

“1 Drink, Indra, of the savoury juice, and cheer Thee with our milky
draught.  
Be, for our weal, our Friend and sharer of the feast, and let Thy wisdom
guard us well.”

RV VII 32:

“1 Let none, no, not Thy worshippers, delay Thee far away from us.  
Even from far away come Thou unto our feast, or listen if already here.”

RV VI 37:

“1 Let Thy Bay Horses, yoked, O mighty Indra, bring Thy car hither
fraught with every blessing.  
For Thee, the Heavenly, e’en the poor invoketh: may we this day, Thy
feast-companions, prosper.”

RV I 180 \[an Asvin Hymnal\]:

“6 When, Bounteous Ones, Ye drive Your yoked team downward, Ye send, by
Your own natures, understanding.  
Swift as the wind let the prince please and feast You: he, like a pious
man, gains strength for increase.”

RV I 136:

“4 This Soma be most sweet to Mitra, Varuṇa: He in the drinking-feasts,
shall have a share thereof, sharing, a God, among the Gods.  
May all the Gods of one accord accept it joyfully to-day.”

RV I 135:

“1 Strewn is the sacred grass; come Vāyu, to our feast, with team of
thousands, come, Lord of the harnessed team, with hundreds, Lord of
harnessed steeds!  
The drops divine are lifted up for Thee, the God, to drink them first.  
The juices rich in sweets have raised them for Thy joy, have raised
themselves to give Thee strength.  
2 Purified by the stones the Soma flows for Thee, clothed with its
lovely splendours, to the reservoir, flows clad in its refulgent
light.  
For Thee the Soma is poured forth, Thy portioned share mid Gods and
men.  
Drive Thou Thy horses, Vāyu, come to us with love, come well-inclined
and loving us.  
3 Come Thou with hundreds, come with thousands in Thy team to this our
solemn rite, to taste the sacred food, Vāyu, to taste the offerings.  
This is Thy seasonable share, that comes co-radiant with the Sun.  
Brought by attendant priests pure juice is offered up, Vāyu, pure juice
is offered up.  
4 The chariot with its team of horses bringYou both, to guard us and to
taste the well-appointed food, Vāyu, to taste the offerings!  
Drink of the pleasant-flavoured juice: the first draught is assigned to
You.”

I could, once again, go on at quite some (considerable) length (as if I
haven’t done so already) – but I think that my point is made.

What we see in those above quoted verses, even in translation, is
something which renders quite differently from going down the pub with
your mates. And is instead a far more sacred, sanctic (yet joyful)
paradigm – where the Gods do indeed come and enjoy the feast, and we may
indeed drink with Them … yet there is never any doubt as to just Who is
being honoured, and that the terms of this relationship bear far closer
resemblance to … well, I suppose ‘visiting royalty’ is probably the best
illustrative simulacra that many of us would be at least somewhat
familiar with today. Visiting Royalty is, indeed, quite literally what
is occurrent here (and as I covered in my writeup of the ritual worship
observed at Devi Kothi, for instance – these parallels continue apace
beyond ‘just’ the feasting) – although with deference to what we have
observed via the Ancient Greeks’ perspectives, it is perhaps useful to
re-emphasize that this is not *mortal, human* royalty … but the actual
Lords of Heaven and other such realms. Figures most definitely deserving
of such homage, whatever one’s thoughts about monarchy as a mere human
institution whether in history or today.

And something wherein it would seem quite the opposite of being a
‘slave’ to be engaged to. After all, it is a rare thing that a “slave”
would be eating and drinking in the company of the visiting regent.

We engage in proper and pious acts of devotion in no small part because
we *choose* to – while there *are* occasions in the history and in the
myth wherein the neglect to properly propitiate a deific has resulted in
disastrous calamity, this is often because the law of the cosmos has
been violated in direct or adjacent consequence. And the facts of
*knowing* what it is which we do, and why it is that we do it – well,
these are, again, things concordant with active choice rather than
enslaved compulsion.

Others may, as ever, disagree – and persist with an attempt at relating
to divinity in a manner which actively jettisons all proper forms and
etiquette in favour of a far more ‘modern’ and
manthropocentricparadigm. Perhaps they may even attempt to communicate
with the Gods by txtinga “sup2 bro?” by way of invite to this
“drinking”, who knows. \|

You can proclaim your intent to go drinking with your imagined peers all
you want.

As for myself? Well, I’ll be feasting with a King !
