### (*The Sunday Herald* June 30, 1895)

Stopping for a time at the well-known cottage of Miss E.H. Dutcher at
Thousand Island Park are Mr. and Mrs. Walter Goodyear, Miss Ethel Howe,
Miss Stella Campbell of New York city, Miss Ellen Waldo of Brooklyn,
also the Swami Vivekananda of India. The latter was a delegate at the
World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago, and one of the most popular
of the many learned men from the far East.

After the close of the Parliament the Swami remained in this country
lecturing through the West and later in the East. He is an able exponent
of Hindoo philosophy and has attracted many to listen to his teachings.
