## CHAPTER XII

THE CAMP UNDER THE CHENNAARS

PERSONS: The Swami Vivekananda and a party of Europeans and disciples,
amongst whom were Dhira Mata, the "Steady Mother"; one whose name was
Jaya; and Nivedita.

PLACE: Kashmir — Srinagar.

TIME: August 14 to August 20, 1898.

AUGUST 14.

It was Sunday morning and next afternoon the Swami was prevailed on to
come up to tea with us in order to meet a European guest who seemed to
be interested in the subject of Vedanta. He had been little inclined to
concern himself with the matter, and I think his real motive in
accepting was probably to afford his too-eager disciples an opportunity
of convincing themselves of the utter futility of all such attempts as
this. Certainly he took infinite pains with the enquirer and, as
certainly, his trouble was wasted.

I remember his saying, amongst other things, "How I wish a law could be
broken. If we were really able to break a law we should be free. What
you call breaking the law is really only another way of keeping it".
Then he tried to explain a little of the superconscious life. But his
words fell on ears that could not hear.

AUGUST 16.

On Tuesday he came once more to our little camp to the midday meal.
Towards the end it began to rain heavily enough to prevent his return,
and he took up Tod's *History of Rajasthan*, which was lying near, and
drifted into talk of Mirâ Bâi. "Two-thirds of the national ideas now in
Bengal", he said, "have been gathered from this book".

But the episode of Mira Bai, the queen who would not be queen, but would
wander the world with the lovers of Krishna, was always his favourite,
even in Tod. He talked of how she preached submission, prayerfulness,
and service to all in contrast to Chaitanya, who preached love to the
name of God, and mercy to all.

Mira Bai was always one of his great patronesses. He would put into her
story many threads with which one is now familiar in other connections,
such as the conversation of two great robbers, and the end by an image
of Krishna opening and swallowing her up. I heard him on one occasion
recite and translate one of her songs to a woman. I wish I could
remember the whole, but it began in his rendering with the words "Cling
to it, cling to it, cling to it, Brother", and ended with "If Ankâ and
Bankâ, the robber brothers; Sujan, the fell butcher; and the courtesan
who playfully taught her parrot to repeat the name of the Lord Krishna
were saved, there is hope for all".

Again, I have heard him tell that marvellous tale of Mira Bai in which
on reaching Vrindaban, she sent for a certain famous Sâdhu.[1](#fn1) He
refused to go on the ground that women might not see men in Vrindaban.
When this had happened three times, Mira Bai went to him herself saying
that she had not known that there were such beings as men there; she had
supposed that Krishna alone existed. And when she saw the astonished
Sadhu, she unveiled herself completely, with the words "Fool, do you
call yourself a man?" And as he fell prostrate before her with a cry of
awe, she blessed him as a mother blesses her child.

Today the Swami passed on to the talk of Akbar and sang us a song of
Tânsen, the poet-laureate of the emperor:

Seated on the throne, a god amongst men,  
Thou, the Emperor of Delhi.  
Blessed was the hour, the minute, the second,  
When thou ascendest the throne,  
O God amongst men,  
Thou, the Lord of Delhi.  
Long live thy crown, thy sceptre, thy throne,  
O God amongst men,  
Thou, Emperor of Delhi.  
Live long, and remain awakened always,  
O son of Humayoon,  
Joy of the sun, God amongst men,  
Thou, the Emperor of Delhi!

Then the talk passed to "our national hero" Pratâp Singh, who never
could be brought to submission. Once indeed he was tempted to give in,
at that moment when having fled from Chitore and the queen herself
having cooked the scanty evening meal, a hungry cat swooped down on that
cake of bread which was the children's portion, and the King of Mewar
heard his babies cry for food. Then, indeed, the strong heart of the man
failed him. The prospect of ease and relief tempted him. And for a
moment he thought of ceasing from the unequal conflict and sending his
alliance to Akbar, only for an instant. The Eternal Will protects its
own. Even as the picture passed before his mind, there appeared a
messenger with those despatches from a famous Rajput chief that said,
"There is but one left amongst us who has kept his blood free from
admixture with the alien. Let it never be said that his head has touched
the dust". And the soul of Pratap drew in the long breath of courage and
renewed faith; and he arose and swept the country of its foes and made
his own way back to Udaipur.

Then there was the wonderful tale of the virgin princess Krishna Kumâri,
whose hand was sought by various royal suitors at once. And when three
armies were at the gate, her father could think of nothing better than
to give her poison. The task was entrusted to her uncle, and he entered
her room, as she lay asleep, to do it. But at the sight of her beauty
and youth, remembering her too as a baby, the soldier's heart failed
him, and he could not perform his task. But she was awakened by some
sound, and being told what was proposed, stretched out her hand for the
cup and drank the poison with a smile. And so on, and so on. For the
stories of Rajput heroes in this kind are endless.

AUGUST 20.

On Saturday the Swami and he whose name was Soong went to the Dahl Lake
to be the guests of the American consul and his wife for a couple of
days. They returned on Monday, and on Tuesday the Swami came up to the
new Math, as we called it, and had his boat moved close by ours so that
he could be with us for a few days before leaving for Ganderbal.
