title = "The pa~nchAvarNa stava"

+++
The great siddhAnta tantric aghorashiva deshika from the mid-1100s of
the CE from the Tamil country composed an epitome of siddhAnta worship
of the 5- headed sadAshiva and the AvaraNas of his maNDala. This is the
pa\~nchAvarNa stava, which resembles other siddhAnta compositions like
the shiva-pUjA stava of j\~nAnashaMbhu deshika of vArANasi (originally
also from TN) and the paddhati termed the dhyAna-ratnAvalI by
trilochanashiva, the student of aghorashiva. The smArta appaya dIkShita
recommends it for nitya pUjA. A superior edition of the pa\~nchAvarNa
stava has been produced by the efforts of Institut Francais de
Pondichery that supersedes versions printed previously in the Tamil
script with the usual atrocities of tamil pronunciation. This text is in
multiple classical meters – the most common of which are anuShTubh,
vasanta-tilaka, upajAti and shAlini.
