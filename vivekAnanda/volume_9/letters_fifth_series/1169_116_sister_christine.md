## CXVI

*To Sister Christine*

JODHPUR, RAJPUTANA,

*4th January 1898*.

Love and greetings etc. to thee, dear Christina, and a happy New Year.
May it find you younger in heart, stronger in body, and purer in spirit.

I am still travelling in season and out of season. Lecturing some,
working a good deal.

Have you seen Mr. \[Edward T.\] Sturdy of England, who, I learn, has
been to Detroit? Did you like him?

I am quite well and strong. Hope to meet you this blessed year again in
America.

I am going to Calcutta in a few days, where I intend to be the rest of
this cold weather. Next summer, I start for England or America most
probably.

Yours ever in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
