After brahmA had generated the world, into sAvitrI, the excellent maid,
he ejaculated his semen, just like a male lover into the female lover.
For 100 years she held that divine fetus that is difficult to bear. Then
she gave birth and sent out: the four fascinating veda-s, various
collections of shAstra-s, logic, grammar and the like; divine
encaptivating rAgini-s numbered thirty six, six beautiful rAga-s along
with various musical scales; the satya, tretA, dvApara and kali which is
the age of strife, the year, month, season, tithi, daNDa (=60 vikAla-s,
a water clock unit), seconds and the like, days, nights, week, twilights
and dawns; puShTi, devasenA, medhA, vijayA, jayA, the six kR^ittikA-s,
the marker stars (of nakShatra-s), the divisions of the day and the
wealth of tapas, devasenA, who is the great ShaShThI, the dear wife of
kArttikeyA, the mothers who are the supreme chosen deities of the
children; the 3 kalpa-s known as brahma, padma and varaha; the quotidian
and occasional events; the 50 years of brahmA (dviparArdha) and the
emanations of prakR^iti, the four-fold deluges, who are verily the
daughters of death, and also all the groups of diseases. Having given
birth to these she gave them her breast \[to suckle\].
