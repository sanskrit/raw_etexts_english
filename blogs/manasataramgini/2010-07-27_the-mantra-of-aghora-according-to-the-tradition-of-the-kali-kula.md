The devI aghorA, as we have seen
[before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/01/05/a-discursion-on-the-sanatkumariya-panchabrahma-siddha-shamkara-tantra-and-the-early-evolution-of-the-dakshinashaiva-system/),
emerged first as the shakti of aghora in the root tantra-s of the
bhairava srotas. She was described under several related names such as
aghoreshvarI and appears to be the foundation from which the primary
devI-s of the trika and
[pashchimAmnAya](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/05/paschimamnayeshvari-and-shiva-of-the-shikha/)
emerged. Under the name aghorA itself she was worshiped in the tradition
emerging from the glorious yoginI-jAla-shaMvara tantra. The worship of
the great bhairava yoginI-jAla-shaMvara and his parivAra is taught as an
auxiliary a\~Nga of the system of the brahma-yAmala, which gives his
highly secret mantra as a means of achieving khecharI siddhi and this
yoga is declared to be “amitAtmaka”, i.e. of unlimited nature. This
tradition was expanded in the yoginI-jAla-shaMvara tantra and from that
text transmitted to the yoginI-samchAra tantra. The tradition of this
latter tantra was then incorporated into the composite
jayadratha-yAmala. The yoginI-saMchAra lays out worship the devI aghorA
in the company of the great bhairava. The YS states that the tAntrika
after undergoing dIkSha and abhiSheka performs vrata-s such as the
bhairava-vrata, the kapAla-vrata or the chAmuNDA-vrata. In the rite of
dIkSha which is performed in the shmashAna the AchArya wearing an
osseous garland and smeared with the bhasma from the funeral pyres draws
the maNDala of the great bhIma-vikrama bhairava (yoginI-jAla-shaMvara)
conjoined with the devI aghorA. Then the student after a bath is lead to
the maNDala where the AchArya touches him on the head with a skull and
performs the nyAsa on his body with the khaTvA\~Nga. Then in the typical
tAntrika fashion the student is lead to the image of shiva with face
covered and is asked to cast flowers on it, standing to its right, after
a pradakShiNa. Based on which face the flower falls he is given his
dIkSha kula. After receiving the mantra he finally worships aghorA
accompanied by the 63 yoginI-s of this system.

The devI aghorA in this aspect as a shmashAna deity with “kApAlika”
attributes has been retained as is in the kAlI kula. Here mantra is
taught in the kAmakalA kAlI khaNDa (8.277-283) of the pa\~nchAshat
sAhasryAM mahAkAla saMhitA. But here her iconography has some unusual
features:

The 25-syllabled mantra of aghorA specified here is:  
hrIM shrIM kroM klIM strIM aiM krauM ChrIM phreM krIM hskhphreM huM
aghore siddhiM me dehi dApaya svAhA ||  
The devI is meditated upon as residing in the cremation ground with
limbs glistening like a moist mountain of black collyrium, with three
large red eyes, with a shapely body decorated with sparkling ornaments
of white human bones, space-clad, with free-flowing tresses, with
earrings made from human skulls, standing on a corpse, with dreadful
saber teeth and with two arms holding a broom and a winnowing fan. While
the general description of her matches the ancestral state as in the
tradition of the YJS, the broom and the winnowing fan are unusual. This
appears to be the prototype on which emergent deities like dhUmAvatI
were partly based.
