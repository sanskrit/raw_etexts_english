## CXXIX

*To Mr. E. T. Sturdy*

KASHMIR,

*3rd July, 1898.*

DEAR STURDY,

Both the editions had my assent, as it was arranged between us that we
would not object to anybody's publishing my books. Mrs. Bull knows about
it all and is writing to you.

I had a beautiful letter from Miss Souter the other day. She is as
friendly as ever.

With love to the children, Mrs. Sturdy, and yourself

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
