title = "The lineage of kAli-kula as presented by arNa-siMha"

+++
paNDita arNa-siMha is today a poorly known teacher. From his two works
the khachakrapa\~nchaka stotra and mahAnaya prakAsha, we glean that he
was once part of an illustrious kAli-kula lineage, which began with
shivAnanda-nAtha-I who he calls j\~nAna-netra or j\~nAna-chakShu. He
even suggests that the khachakrapa\~nchaka’s mantrashAstra was first
“brought down” by shivAnanda. He names a lineage of kAlikula teachers
to which he belongs which appears to intersect with the lineage
mentioned by jayaratha the commentator on abhinavagupta. arNasimHa’s
lineage is:

``` 
                 shivAnandanAtha
          female teacher keyUravatI
                     vAmana
                   chakrabhAnu
                  /         \
 female teacher IshAnikA | prabodha
            nandaka      | jaiyaka
            sajjana      | pa~Nka
            someshvara   | nAga
                   \        /
                    arNasiMha
 
```

After chakrabhAnu the kAli-kula tradition branched into two lineages
which unified again under arNasimha.  
khachakrapa\~nchaka stotra is stotra full of power – good stotra-s are
of different kinds. Some have good poetry and are easily followed by all
sAdhakas, such as those attributed to sha\~Nkara, some have deep mantra
embeddings, and some are only for advanced users and convey rahasya-s of
a tantric system to them. The KhPS is of the latter type and also
conceals within it an immense mantra power. It is not easy to expound it
but it needs to be “experienced” as a first person experience.  
This is sensed right in the 2nd verse itself:  
ekA devI parasarati parA vyomahaMkAra-ghoShA  
chakraM raudraM gagana-sadR^ishaM rashmi-pu\~njaM samagram |  
vyomAkAraakalita-kalanAnanda-bhAsA-prachaNDaM  
bhAShAtItaM vismaya-viShayaM devI-chakraM namAmi ||  
The one goddess, the supreme, spreads the sound the ahaMkAra \[\*1\] of
space – the terrifying chakra \[\*2\] which appears like the sky, the
collection \[of all things\], the mass of rays. Whose form is like pure
space, formidable with the light of the bliss of the unmanifest spot (or
embryo) \[\*3\]. I salute the chakra of the goddess whose sphere is
wondrous and beyond language.  
\[1\] The term ahaMkAra here should be understood in the sAMkhya sense
as expounded in the bhR^igu smR^iti.  
\[2\] It must be understood that the chakra referred to twice in this
verse is multifunction in that it refers to the maNDala or yantra of
bhAnavI-kaulinI and its projection in the form of the world with the sun
coursing through the sky and the projection into consciousness.  
\[3\] kalana often means a spot or the zygote in embryology. Both these
meanings are woven together in this case –the bindu of the yantra as the
spot and the unmanifest existence is likened to the zygote which
represent the “unmanifest” form of the organism that will develop from
it. It also represents the basic bIjamantra of the kula: khaphreM.  
This is a succinct the description of bhAnavI-kaulinI the mistress of
the khachakra. As we noted above the stotra itself uses the term
“bhAShAtItaM” beyond language. Then starting with vinAyaka and his
shakti the stotra outlines the complex maNDala of the devI with the
hosts of yoginI-s in each circle.
