“The coin in question, if you were wondering, is a Kushan minting from
the reign of King Vasudeva, also a Hindu convert.

Depicted on the right is Shiva with Nandi, and on the left, ‘Oesho’ –
“Ishvara” \[‘God-Emperor’\], another Epithet \[and cosmological
Function\] of Mahadev, although also possibly \[contingent upon which
etymological theorizing we are going with\], a linguistic re-merging of
“Vayu” and “Shiva/Ishvara” \[Vayu, Vayu-Vata, – the Wind God \[and of
potential etymological, as well as obvious mythological, linkage to
Odin\] – \*also\* being a Form of Shiva\]
