On a village I visited

Skanda-svāmi’s holy tree,with the afternoon rays of Rājña. And Srauṣa
was not too far off either 🙂

A nearby shrine of Srauṣa(Śiva) in worship in the Bengali month of
Srabon.



eka-vaktraṃ trinetraṃ ca hema-ratna-kiriṭinaṃ ।  
catur-bhujair vajra śakti śara-kārmuka dhāriṇaṃ॥  
udyat-bhānu-sahasrābhaṃ ca śukla-yajñopavītinaṃ ।  
bhūta-vetāla-gaṇākīrṇaṃ rājña srauṣa sevitaṃ ॥



was what I recollected with unusual force as I saw the kadamba tree
then(with credits to
