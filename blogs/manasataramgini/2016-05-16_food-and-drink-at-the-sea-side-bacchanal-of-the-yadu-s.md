title = "Food and drink at the sea-side bacchanal of the yadu-s"

+++
Sections 2.88-89 of the Harivaṃśa (Viṣṇuparvan) gives a graphic
description of the bacchanal of the yadu-s at the sea-side or their
celebration of the samudrotsava. It has a beautiful ring to it and gives
a feel for the festive culinary excesses of the ārya-s, or at least
their yadu branch, after they had settled in the subcontinent. We hence
present it below, especially given that a notable section of Hindus who
still read such texts tend to be rather coy about sections such as
these. The two great and dramatic images from the epic – the sea-side
bacchanal and their final end in the sea-side drunken brawl are a stark
illustration of how an exuberant existence like that of the yadu-s is
not for ever.

upendram uttīrṇam athāśu dṛṣṭvā  
bhaimā hi te tatyajur eva toyam ।  
vivikta-gātrāstv atha pāna-bhūmiṃ  
kṛṣṇājñayā te yayur aprameyāḥ ॥ 2-89-55

Having seen the brother of Indra (Viṣṇu as Kṛṣṇa) swiftly get out the
Bhaima-s (Yadu-s) also abandoned the water. Now with their bodies
cleansed they went to the drinking-arena.

yathā+anupūrvyā ca yathā vayaśca  
yat sanniyogāś ca tadopaviṣṭāḥ ।  
annāni vīrā bubhujuḥ pratītāḥ  
papuś ca peyāni yathā+anukūlam ॥ 2-89-56

By the order of their rank and their relationships they seated
themselves in there. The heroes having made themselves comfortable ate
the foods and drank the drinks of their liking.

māṃsāni pakvāni phalāmlakāni  
cukrottareṇa+atha ca dāḍimena ।  
niṣṭapta-śūlāñ chakalān paśūṃśca  
tatropajahruḥ śucayo’tha sūdāḥ ॥ 2-89-57

There (in the feasting arena) hygienic cooks then served them meats
marinaded in acidic fruit juices, excellent vinegar and pomegranates,
and slices of animals roasted on stakes.

susvinna-śūlyān mahiṣāṃś ca bālāñ  
chūlyan-suniṣṭapta ghṛtāvasiktān ।  
vṛkṣāmla-sauvarcala-cukrapūrṇā  
paurogavoktyā upajahrur eṣām ॥ 2-89-58

Instructed by the chief chef \[the cooks then\] served them well-boiled
and roasted buffalo and lamb \[meat\] impaled on spikes, sprinkled with
ghee and well-marinaded with sour-vegetable juice, black salt and
vinegar.

paurogavoktyā vidhinā mṛgāṇāṃ  
māṃsāni siddhāni ca pīvarāṇi ।  
nānā-prakārāṇy upajahrur eṣāṃ  
mṛṣṭāni pakvāni ca cukra-cūtaiḥ ॥ 2-89-59

Instructed by the chef with due procedure \[the cooks\] served them
dressed and cooked flesh and fat of various animals which were glazed
with \[a sauce\] of vinegar and mangoes.

pārśvāni cānye śakalāni tatra  
daduḥ paśūnāṃ ghṛta-mṛkṣitāni ।  
sāmudra-cūrṇair-avacūrṇitāni  
cūrṇena mṛṣṭena samāricena ॥ 2-89-60

Thereafter they gave \[the yadu-s\] ribs and other slices of animals
smeared with ghee mixed with powdered sea-salt and ground black pepper.

samūlakair-dāḍima-mātuliṅgaiḥ  
parṇāsa-hiṅgvārdraka-bhūstṛṇaiś ca ।  
tadopa-daṃśaiḥ sumukhottaraiste  
pānāni hṛṣṭāḥ papur aprameyāḥ ॥ 2-89-61

\[They served\] radishes, pomegranates, sweet limes, mahagony fruits
spiced with asa foetida, ginger, and broad-leafed turpentine grass.
\[Then\] the incomparable heroes joyously drank drinks from rhytons with
beautiful faces.

kaṭvāṅka śūlairapi pakṣibhiś ca  
ghṛtāmla-sauvarcala-tailasiktaiḥ ।  
maireya-mādhvīka-surāsavāṃste  
papuḥ priyābhiḥ parivāryamāṇāḥ ॥ 2-89-62

Along with bird-flesh impaled and \[fried\] in ghee and oil, marinaded
with black salt, vinegar and bitter-gourd paste they drank wine, mead,
beer and rum along with their dear female companions and retinue.

śvetena yuktā nṛpa śoṇitena  
bhakṣyān-sugandhāṃl lavaṇānvitāṃś ca ।  
ārdrān-kilāṭān-ghṛta-pūrṇakāṃś ca  
nānā-prakārān api khaṇḍa-khādyān ॥ 2-89-63

O king \[Then\] they ate \[desert\] which was white and red in color,
great-smelling and salty, and confections of various types which were
soft and filled with ghee and made from congealed milk.

apānapāś coddhava-bhojamiśrāḥ  
śākaiś ca sūpaiś ca bahu-prakāraiḥ ।  
peyaiś ca dadhnā payasā ca vīrāḥ  
svannāni rājan bubhujuḥ prahṛṣṭāḥ ॥ 2-89-64

O king Uddhava and the Bhoja miśra brāhmaṇa-s who did not drink liquors
\[consumed\] vegetarian \[dishes\] and soups of various kinds. Joyously
these valiant ones drank curds and pāyasa and ate good food.

tathāranālāṃś ca bahu-prakārān  
papuḥ sugandhān api pālavīṣu ।  
śṛtaṃ payaḥ śarkarayā ca yuktaṃ  
phala-prakārāṃś ca bahūṃś ca khādan ॥ 2-89-65

Then they drank well-flavored sour rice gruel of various kinds and
boiled milk sweetened with sugar from tumblers and ate various types of
fruits.

tṛptāḥ pravṛttāḥ punareva vīrā-  
ste bhaimamukhyā vanitāsahāyāḥ ।  
gītāni ramyāṇi jaguḥ prahṛṣṭāḥ  
kāntābhi-nītāni manoharāṇi ॥ 2-89-66

Again getting up satisfied \[with the feasting\] the leaders of the
bhaima (yadu-s) along with the ladies joyfully sang beautiful songs
charmingly prompted by their wives.

::::::::::::::::

Certain points are notable here: To any modern Hindu it would be obvious
that the menu of the yadu-s was rather different from that of modern
Hindus from the same region. In being heavy on meat, ghee and milk
products it is certainly close to that of the ancestral Indo-Aryans on
the Eurasian steppes. The flavoring, which is repeatedly emphasized in
the account, is relatively elaborate and clearly represents, at least in
part, the Indianization of the Indo-Aryan menu. It primarily comprises
of sea salt, black salt, vinegar, asa foetida, ginger, scented grass,
black pepper, bitter gourd, mango, pomegranate, and probably the acidic
juices of gooseberry, Garcinia indica (cukrāmla) and tamarind. The
fruits from which the acidic juices were obtained are not explicitly
named, but any or all of them could be what is implied by phalāmlakāni
and vṛkṣāmla. However, many of the well-known later day Indian spices
are not named here. Whether it is merely a textual omission or whether
it really reflects the early Indo-Aryan dietary preference in what is
today Gujarat is still unclear. Of these the hiṅgu (Asa foetida; latex
of Ferula) was probably the first the ārya-s adopted even as they
entered the Bactria-Margiana region (where it was likely native) and it
is even mentioned in the Atharvaveda. In addition, the term anna while
translated generally as food could also specifically mean rice in the
above account.

Likewise, the fare of fruits/vegetables is relatively simple: radish
(turnip), mango, pomegranate, sweetlime and mahogany fruits. The last of
these is no longer popular in India and some fruits which are known to
have been used in the Indus valley civilization, like the kadali, do not
figure in this account. They are not common until much later in Sanskrit
tradition. In this context the word dāḍima raises a question: We usually
take it to mean pomegranate. However, Sanskritists have told us that
here it might mean the cardamom. If this were true then it would give us
one more spice. However, the pomegranate was probably well-known to the
Indo-Iranians via trade even as they neared the Bactria-Margiana region
so we see no reason for the less-obvious translation. Thus, based on
this and from comparable evidence from the Mahābhārata, it is possible
that the Indo-Aryans or at least their elite did not adopt all existing
Indian dietary choices by default. However, we cannot entirely rule out
poetic omission, especially because they were still conservatively
following older conventions even in the culinary account.

Of the drinks, mead and beer were likely prepared by the Indo-Europeans
on the steppe, especially given that the Vedic beer faithfully uses the
old IE grain, barley. The rum was likely acquired from the pre-Aryan
Indians. While I translated maireya as wine above, it is unlikely to
mean wine in the Indian context. The classical Hindu bhojana specialists
like Aruṇadatta state that maireya was prepared by fermenting either the
kodrava (millet) grain or kharjūra (date), whereas Kauṭilya holds that
it was made from fermenting of certain plant extracts followed by a
complex flavoring process. The flavored soured rice-gruel was a drink
that probably proceeded through a primarily acidic fermentation pathway
rather than being primarily alcoholic. The origins of this drink and the
flavors used with it remain unclear. Finally, we have rendered the
sumukhottara following a traditional Harivaṃśa exponent as being a
rhyton. While rhytons are rare in India, the few early examples which
have been found show a similar form to those from Mycenaean Greek and
Iranian sites. Hence, this interpretation might not be out of place.

These, culinary features might be compared to the glimpse we are offered
by the poetess Auvaiyār of the feasts sponsored by her patron the great
Tamil war-lord Atiyamān Neṭumān Añci. Therein we see a similar emphasis
on meat, and alcoholic drinks, and at least one common flavoring agent,
i.e. the scented grass. However, the liquor favored by the Atiyamān is
toddy which we do not seem to encounter in the Yadu bacchanal unless we
take the maireya to be some such. A fare similar to the Harivaṃśa is
also encountered in a somewhat later Dramiḻa work, the
Porunarāṭṭruppaḍai. There the coḻā Karikāla offers his proteges a
meal rich in meat prepared similar to this account and rice. Finally,
this brings us to the brāhmaṇa-s who seem to explicitly avoid the meat
and the liquors. Now, someone could argue that the statement regarding
the brāhmaṇa-s like Uddhava is a later interpolation by Brahminical
authors who wished to make their dietary strictures very clear. In
support of this one could cite the use of the term bhoja-miśra for the
Yadu brāhmaṇa-s as being indicative of the use of later Brahminical
title of miśra. However, we cannot be sure of such an interpretation
because otherwise the rest of this section does not show any notable
signs of “tampering”.
