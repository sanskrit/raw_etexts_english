Dissenting note to the report of the Committee by Dr K L Daftari

I agree with the final report of the Committee dissenting only on the following point. I hold that the fixed nakṣatras, though regarded as enjoined by the dharmaśāstras should not be taken into consideration in fixing days of the religious functions, or the dharmaśāstras be regarded as enjoining the moving nakṣatras starting from a point 23° 15' ahead of the equinoctial point. I have given my reasons previously in my letters to the Chairman of the Committee, (a summary of which will be found as Annexure IV). 



MAHAL, NAGPUR I The 10th December, 1954
