<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3" xml:lang="hi-IN">Spiritual Greatness of the Gopīs</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“It is no use enjoying pleasure after pleasure and possessing immense wealth, nor is it any use becoming a great ascetic besmearing the body with ashes.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“It is little use surrounding oneself with fires on all sides and sitting under the sun in summer, or acquiring the power of floating in water, or extending one’s dominion across the seas.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“You may repeat sacred formulas times without number, practise austerities and exercise control over body and mind, observe fasts for any number of days, undertake pilgrimages to a thousand sacred places; but who the devil cares for all these?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“He is really an uncultured boor who loves not, nor enjoys the blessed company of the beloved child of Nanda.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“You may possess a number of mansions cast in gold, the splendour of which dazzles the eyes, and which are perpetually illumined by rows of bright rubies and other precious stones.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“All this is of no use, says Rasakhāna, if you have not been able to love the yellow-robed śrī Kr̥ṣṇa by offering Him the heart!”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">It is nothing short of supererogation on the part of one like myself to attempt to write anything on the Love of the Gopīs. The truth about that Love may be known to a certain extent only by such lovers and devotees of the Lord towhom it may be revealed in all kindness by the Blissful Aspect of the Lord embodied as śrī Rādhā, and by the Supreme Divine, śrī Kr̥ṣṇa Himself, the transcendent ocean of Bliss and Love, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss. One who knows the truth about this Love cannot, again, speak or write about it, inasmuch as the sports of the Lord at Vr̥ndāvana through which that Love is revealed cannot be expressed through words. It is something beyond human conception, transcendent, supernatural. The inhabitants of Vraja of the time of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa were no other than the eternal associates of the Lord, who came from beyond the region of <span class="char-style-override-6">Māyā,</span> and manifested themselves on earth in order to participate in the boyish sports of the Lord under the direction and guidance of His Divine Energy, śrī Rādhā, who embodied the Blissful Aspect of the Lord. Even the creator of the universe, Brahmā, soliciting the dust of the feet of these <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmās</span> (great souls) manifested in Vraja, said:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“O Lord, may I have the rare good fortune of being enlisted as a servant of Thine either in this very birth or even through birth in one of the lower species of animals, so that I may be able to serve Your sacred feet. Enviable is the lot of Nanda and the other cowherds of Vraja, who have got Thee, the Supreme Eternal, Blissful Lord, for their friend. It is a great privilege to be born in Vraja, and more particularly in Gokula, even as an insect that crawls on earth, for that may afford one an opportunity of sanctifying one’s head through the dust of the feet of any of the blessed inhabitants of Vraja.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">How great were the inhabitants of Vraja the dust of whose feet was sought by Brahmā himself! Kicking aside liberation, they have gone far beyond that state in spiritual realization. Even Brahmā admitted this when He said, “Lord, you vouchsafed salvation even to Pūtanā, the demoness, who came with the evil intention of killing You painting her breasts with deadly poison. Will you confer the same thing on these lovers of Yours? Nay, You will have to remain bound in perpetual debt to them.” The Lord Himself acknowledged this in the following memorable words addressed to the Gopīs.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“O dear ones, you have shown your Devotion to Me by snapping off the strong ties of the family and of relations. It is not possible for Me to repay the debt of this sacred Devotion of yours even if I serve you for the whole life-time of a celestial being. You alone can discharge Me from this obligation through your own generosity.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>

He keeps all beings, gods, demons, Gandharvas (demi-gods) and men alike perpetually bound by the fetters of <span class="char-style-override-6">Karma,</span> He allows Himself to be tied to the husking-stand by the milk-maid Yaśodā. The Lord of <span class="char-style-override-6">Māyā,</span> Hari, who makes the entirecreation dance to the tune of His <span class="char-style-override-6">Māyā</span> loses the game in favour of His playmates and as a condition of the game plays the horse and carries the cowherd boys on His back! Blessed are those men, women and children of Vraja! It happened, one day, that Devī Yaśodā was engaged in some household duties when the child śrī Kr̥ṣṇa became obstinate and asked the mother to take Him in her arms. The mother turned a deaf ear to His importunities. This upset the child who began to weep and roll on the floor of the courtyard. Just at that moment appeared on the scene Devarṣi Nārada who had felt an impulse in his heart to witness the boyish sports of his beloved Lord. He found that the Lord of entire creation, the Abode of Supreme Bliss, was rolling on the ground and clamouring for being picked up by the mother. The celestial sage was driven into raptures at this unprecedented sight, and addressing Yaśodā, he exclaimed:—</p>

How is it possible for a humble mortal like me to describe that Love which made the Gopīs the dearest object of the Lord Himself? The eligibility for this Love is attained only after one has developed supreme indifference to the enjoyments of the world, and it is only through the grace of those exalted souls who have direct experience of the transcendent region that a devotee may expect to tread the thorny path of Love and obtain a taste of that nectar. For this, however, one is required to pursue a course of spiritual discipline. Through mere study or book-learning it is not possible to reach that height of spiritual experience. An attempt is, however, being made here to give a gist of what I have been able to gather from various sources through the grace of God.

<p class="Page-Break" xml:lang="hi-IN"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">What is Love?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Before attempting to probe into the mystery of the Gopīs’ Love it is necessary to discuss at some length the philsophy of Love itself. In reality Love is not something which can be expressed through words: that which can lend itself to description is the grossest and most external form of Love. The seat of Love is the heart; it transforms the lover into Love-itself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Bhagavān śrī Rāma sent the following message of Love to śrī Sītā:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“O dear, the truth about the Love between You and Me is known only to My mind and that mind constantly stays with You. Know You that herein lies the essence of Love.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">In Love there is no room for self-interest. Where there is any desire for return, there the purity of Love is stained by lust, or desire for self-gratification. In Love there is giving and giving alone: the thought of taking or receiving never occurs to the mind of the lover. Love, again, always tends to grow. A lover can never believe that his is a fully developed love: he always sees his own limitations, his imperfections, and keeps the needle of his heart directed exclusively towards the beloved. Love that hinges round some virtue or expects something in return diminishes or disappears as soon it notices a decline in the virtues of the beloved or apprehends loss of expectation. Love of this type is not love in the proper sense of the term. It is love of self or desire for self-gratification that masquerades as love in that case.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Kabīra says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">“Now it swells and the very next </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">moment ebbs low, is not Love,</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">That alone which is firmly rooted </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">in the heart and knows no ebb</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">should be given the name of Love.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">* छिनहिं चढ़ै छिन ऊतरै, सो तो प्रेम न होय।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">अघट प्रेम पिंजर बसै, प्रेम कहावै सोय॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Again, it is said:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“An attraction between lovers which knows no extinction even in the presence of factors favourable to such extinction is called Love.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">* सर्वथा ध्वंसरहितं सत्यपि ध्वंसकारणे।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">For instance, suppose the object of our love loses his wealth, his beauty fades, his virtues give place to vices he ceases to reciprocate our love of show regard to us, snubs us at every step, offers insult to us and shows respect to others in our very presence or manifests thousands of evil tendencies. Under such circumstances our love for our beloved is sure to disappear. This is our experience of Love as it is known in the world. True love is that which does not diminish even in such conditions but goes on increasing everyday.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Says Rasakhāna:—</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">“That Love is the fountain of all </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">sweetness which is not dependent </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">on youth, virtue, beauty or wealth, </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">nor tainted by self-interest or </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">thoughts of personal gain, and which </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">is pure and free from desire (of </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">self-gratification).</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">Very subtle, very soft, very slender, </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">very remote, Love is the hardest </p>

<p class="Shlok-English">disinterested, unwavering, sublime, unvaried </p>

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">The following is an anecdote connected with the Gopīs who saw Kr̥ṣṇa permeating the whole universe. One of these Gopīs asked another in the course of their talks about Kr̥ṣṇa, in which they remained engaged all the twenty-four hours—“Sister, here is a puzzle for me. The blessed Nanda has got a fair complexion, Queen Yaśodā is fair, even Balarāma is fair-complexioned; while all members of the family are fair, is it not strange that śyāmasundara alone should have been dark-complexioned?” Hearing this the other Gopī, who beheld Kr̥ṣṇa everywhere replied—‘Sister, what a shame? Don’t you know even this?—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“He stays day and night within our eyes painted black by collyrium, O friend, it is due to this that the body of our dearest is dark in colour.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">What a sentiment of deep spiritual significance. In the painted eyes of these Gopīs resided śrī Kr̥ṣṇa alone and nothing else; their eyes beheld nothing else in this wide world. There are some people who hold that the Gopīs never believed in the all-pervading nature of the Lord. This is quite true, inasmuch as these Gopīs saw their beloved śrī Kr̥ṣṇa alone, and nothing else. When in their eyes nothing besides śrī Kr̥ṣṇa existed, then what would He pervade?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3" xml:lang="hi-IN">Bowing, again and again, to the sacred feet of these Gopīs who are merged and lost in this Divine Love of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, we proceed to the next stage of our discussion.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break" xml:lang="hi-IN"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5" xml:lang="hi-IN">The Nature of Gopīs’ Love</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">In the Love of the Gopīs there is no absence of passion; of course, that passion has withdrawn itself from all other objects of worldly attraction, and crossing the barriers of all allurements in the shape of liberation and, worldly enjoyments, which is so difficult to surmount, has centred round śrī Kr̥ṣṇa alone. The mind, the senses, the vital energy—all that the Gopīs possessed—belonged to śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. Whether in this world or in the next, the Gopīs knew no one else than śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. Whether awake or asleep, at work or at recreation, whether engaged in dressing, toilet or in music, or in conversation, they thought of nothing else but making śrī Kr̥ṣṇa happy. It is only when they found śrī Kr̥ṣṇa pleased and gratified that these Gopīs, who had no personal desires, enjoyed a delight whose sweep was almost infinite. The Lord Himself said:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“O Arjuna, the Gopīs take care of their bodies simply because they regard them as instruments of service to Me. Besides the Gopīs there is none who is the object of My secret and profound Love.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">* निजाङ्गमपि या गोप्यो ममेति समुपासते।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">ताभ्य: परं न मे पार्थ निगूढप्रेमभाजनम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">The question may be raised here—‘What is the meaning of rendering happiness to God, Who is Himself the ocean of happiness, Who is solidified Knowledge and Bliss <span class="char-style-override-10">(विज्ञानानन्दघन)</span>? Does God derive His happiness only through the Gopīs? Is not God Himself the source and fountain of all happiness?’ No doubt He is. And śrī Rādhā is nothing else than the embodiment of the Bliss Aspect <span class="char-style-override-10">(ह्लादिनीशक्ति)</span> of the All-powerful God, Who through the music of His flute draws that Aspect of His own, separated for sport, towards Himself. This aspect (Bliss) of God attended by Her subordinate forces is constantly being drawn towards the Lord, who tasting that Bliss distributes the same among those very forces—His beloved devotees. When the music of the Flute—the Master’s Call—enters the ears of the devotee, he forgets his hearth and home and sacrificing every interest that may bind him, he runs like one possessed and intoxicated to make his beloved Lord happy. The Lord accepts this offering of his Love, and sanctifying it with His divine touch returns it to the devotee. When a person goes before a mirror after beautifying his person, the beauty reflected in the mirror is not retained by the mirror but always comes back to the person, and he himself becomes the enjoyer of that beauty. In a similar way the All-beautiful Lord accepts the offering of beauty of the Gopīs, and gives satisfaction to their desire, namely, that He should accept their physical service and make Himself happy through sports of Love with them. God enjoys that bliss Himself and returns it to them as His own offering after augmenting it to an enormous extent. The Love of the Gopīs had this distinction that they possessed not the slightest desire for self-gratification. They did not entertain the thought of personal happiness even in imagination. Finding śrī Kr̥ṣṇa happy through their association, they remained merged in the ocean of bliss whether awake or in sleep. There was no stain of lust in this pure Love of the Gopīs; it was as spotless as the Sun in a cloudless sky; it was purely divine and supernatural. Bringing out this difference between <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> (lust) and <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> (Love) <span class="char-style-override-6">śrī Caitanya-Caritāmr̥ta</span> says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">	    “The object of <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> is enjoyment through gratification of the senses, while <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> has the pleasure of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa for its object. Social conventions, scriptural injunctions, and other <span class="char-style-override-6">Karma</span> (activity), sense of decorum, patience, comfort of body and happiness of mind, renouncing all these, they take to the worship of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. They (the Gopīs) pursue this <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> for the pleasure of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa (not for their own gratification). Therefore, there is a world of difference between <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema.Kāma</span> is pitch darkness, <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> is the brilliance of the sun in a cloudless sky.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">This difference between <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> is very wide and vital. We mortals deluded by the attractions of the senses forget this vital difference and mistaking <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> for <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema,</span> fall an easy prey to our sinful propensities. <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> is honey mixed with poison; while <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> is divine, celestial nectar. While <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> gives place immediately to pain, <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> through every experience of its pang gives the taste of nectarean bliss. In <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> there is satisfaction and gratification of the senses, whereas in <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> there is absorption of Self, and an evergrowing desire for seeing the beloved happy. The gratification of senses through satisfaction of <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> (lust), though appearing sweet in the beginning, is painful in consequence; whereas <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> (Love), though it knows no satiety, is the source of eternal and Supreme Bliss. <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> is intermittent and spasmodic, while <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> is continuous and uninterrupted. <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> has a tendency to subside, but <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> grows eternally. There is thirst for sense-enjoyment in <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma,</span> while in <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> the senses and their enjoyments are entirely forgotten. The object of <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> is gratification of the lower self through sense-enjoyment, while in <span class="char-style-override-6">Prema</span> there is complete renunciation of the world and complete forgetfulness of self.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">True love itself kills the lustful propensity. Although the devotee who has realized this Love would look upon his anxiety to see the Beloved happy as expression of desire—and the senses, mind and intellect being all directed towards Love, such anxiety naturally goes by the name of desire—yet this type of pure and unadulterated Love has no tinge of carnality about it. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Gautamīya Tantra</span> says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">	     “Although the Love of the Gopīs goes by the name of <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> (lust), in reality it is not so. Great devotees and <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmās</span> like Uddhava yearn for this Love, miscalled lust.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">* प्रेमैव गोपरामाणां काम इत्यगमत् प्रथाम्।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">इत्युद्धवादयोऽप्येते वाञ्छन्ति भगवत्प्रिया:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">For the Gopīs had absolutely no desire for gratification of their own senses. Knowing śrī Kr̥ṣṇa to be God Himself, they sought to make Him happy by offering their entire being to Him. Referring to these Gopīs, who had absolutely no attraction for worldly enjoyments and who had merged their very existence in śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. <span class="char-style-override-6">śrī Caitanya-Caritāmr̥ta</span> says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">     “The object of <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāma</span> is to gratify one’s senses. To render happiness to Kr̥ṣṇa is the object of the adorable sentiment of the Gopīs. The Gopīs have no desire of happiness through gratification of senses, it is for the happiness of Kr̥ṣṇa that they engage themselves in sports. The consideration of their own happiness or suffering does not weigh with the Gopīs at all; what they do, they do for the sake of happiness of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. Renouncing everything else, they cherish stainless Love for the happiness of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">One who entertains pure love for śrī Kr̥ṣṇa for the sake of His happiness, regarding his body, mind, wealth, beauty, youth and all that is enjoyable in this world and the next as objects of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa’s enjoyment, is said to have attained Gopī-consciousness. The sentiment of sweetness is predominant in this Gopī-consciousness. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Rasas</span> (sentiments) are five in number—(1) the sentiment of quietism <span class="char-style-override-10">(शान्त)</span>, (2) the sentiment of service <span class="char-style-override-10">(दास्य)</span>, (3) the sentiment of friendship <span class="char-style-override-10">(सख्य)</span>, (4) the sentiment of parental affection <span class="char-style-override-10">(वात्सल्य)</span> and (5) the sentiment of wifely love <span class="char-style-override-10">(माधुर्य)</span>. Each of these, again, is of two kinds according as it is worldly or divine. That is to say, worldly sentiments are five in number as stated above, and divine sentiments are also likewise five. Among these, the last-named, viz., the sentiment of love is the highest; for the four other sentiments, viz., those of quietism, service, friendship and parental affection are covered by this. Inasmuch as it is the noblest of all sentiments, it is the most delicious: hence it is called “sweet” <span class="char-style-override-10">(मधुर)</span>. Even so, among divine sentiments the sentiment of wifely love <span class="char-style-override-10">(कान्ताभाव)</span> is the foremost of all. In the sentiments of quietism and service, the prevailing idea of the devotee is, “God is great and glorious, while I am humble and poor: God is the Lord and Master, and I am His slave.” There is some amount of aloofness in this sentiment as well as an element of shyness and fear. But in the sentiments of friendship, parental affection and wifely love our relation with the Divine is progressively more and more intimate. He is our darling, our most beloved Lord. The Lord here forgets His Supreme greatness, casts a veil over His divinity and is always present before the devotee either as friend, son, or the beloved Lord. In these sentiments there is no place for prayer, no expectation of return. How can there be any prayer before one who is dearest and nearest to us? All that belongs to Him is our own. Even among these, the sentiment of wifely love is supreme. The two other sentiments of friendship and parenthood are fully represented therein. Here there is unremitting service of the Lord—so unremitting that the devotee never feels tired of it; for that service is not rendered to the Lord and Master, but to the dearest object of one’s heart. In the happiness of the beloved the wife feels infinite joy. She never feels that she has rendered enough service to her lord; for the greater the happiness of the beloved, the greater becomes the joy of the devoted wife who contributes to that happiness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">This sentiment of feminine love that one bears towards the Lord has two varieties—(1) the love of the wedded wife, and (2) that of the paramour. In the worldly sphere the love of the paramour is deprecable, nay, detestable; for the same is contaminated by lust or a craving for physical union and gratification of the senses, and the object of love is an erring human being. But in the divine sphere, i. e., when the object of love is the Divine Himself, that type of love is not only worth cultivating but it is considered even superior to the love of the wedded wife. There is no grossness in this love, no craving for physical union or gratification of the senses. The object of love in this case is no human being transgressing the moral code, but the soul of the Universe, God Himself, the Oversoul, Who is the soul alike of the devotee’s husband and children, nay, of the devotee herself. It is in this sense that the love of the Gopīs is regarded as belonging to the latter type, the love of a paramour. Although a devoted wife surrenders her all—her personal and family names, her wealth, her life, nay, her very faith to her husband, and does everything for the sake of the husband, there are three points of exceptional merit in the love of a paramour. These are: (1) constant thought of the beloved, (2) an insatiable longing to meet the beloved, and (3) complete blindness to the faults of the beloved. Since the wedded wife remains under the same roof with her husband all the twenty-four hours, none of these things is present in her. No doubt the Gopīs used to see the Lord everyday: yet, since the sentiment of a paramour was predominant in their love, a moment’s separation would appear unbearable to them. They would curse the Creator for covering their eyes with eye-lids; for had there been no eye-lids at all, the eyes could remain eternally open and drink the nectarean beauty of the Lord without any interruption. They said to their beloved Lord:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">     “During the day-time when You go to the forest (to tend the cows), Your absence makes each moment appear to us as long as an aeon. And when You return from the forest in the evening and we see Your blessed countenance adorned with the side-locks of curly hair, the Creator Brahmā, who created the eye-lids to cover the eyes with, appears to us no better than an awkward fool. That is to say, our failure to see You even for a moment makes us uneasy.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>

In comparison with the service of their dearest Lord, they attached no importance to any other duty. In their Love for śrī Kr̥ṣṇa they had set at naught the restrictions imposed by society and the scriptures. Worldly enjoyments and salvation appeared to them as trivial and worthy of being rejected. The Lord Himself said:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">    “O Uddhava, the Gopīs have dedicated their heart and soul to Me, snapping for My sake all their physical ties.

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">That is the reason why the author of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gīta-Govinda</span> made the Lord appear as yearning for śrī Rādhā’s sacred feet and utter the words “Give Me the privilege of touching Thy gentle feet.” It is on the basis of this very utterance that the renowned devotee Rasakhāna, who had drunk deep of this sweet sentiment, wrote:—</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">“I sought the Divine (Brahma) in </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">the Purāṇas and songs and </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">listened with still greater fervour </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">the hymns of the Vedas;</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">“But nowhere did I perceive Him, or</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">hear what His true Form is, and </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">what His nature.</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">“I got tired through this search yet </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">no man or woman could furnish any</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">clue to Him, says Rasakhāna.</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">“At last, I found Him seated </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">stealthily in a bower shampooing </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">śrī Rādhā’s feet.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Of course, the devotee never desires that his Beloved Lord should shampoo his feet; but here there is complete identity between the lover and the Beloved. No question of superiority or inferiority arises there. In the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahābhārata</span> we find SaÛjaya describing at the Kaurava Court the unique behaviour of Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa towards His devotee-friend Arjuna. When such was the behaviour of the Lord towards Arjuna, what could He not do in relation to devotees of the type of the Gopīs, whose love towards the Lord was unparalleled? The love of the Gopīs was supermundane. Men of the world whose mind and senses are completely under the influence of worldly enjoyments are unable to grasp the true significance of the lofty sentiments of the Gopīs, and smell carnality in their love due to their own sensuality. In reality the love of the Gopīs reached the highest stage of perfection. All the five <span class="char-style-override-6">Rasas</span> (sentiments) were brought into play there, although the sentiment of love was predominant. This sentiment of love gradually develops into fondness, affection, anger <span class="char-style-override-10">(मान)</span>, passion <span class="char-style-override-10">(राग)</span> and fully developed love and reaches the highest stage known by the name of <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhāva</span> (ecstatic love). The perfection of this last stage is called supreme ecstasy of love <span class="char-style-override-10">(महाभाव)</span>. This supreme ecstasy of love was manifested in the blessed Gopīs alone. The All-blissful Lord enacted this absolutely divine and transcendent sport of Love in Vraja in order to satisfy the heart’s desire of His devotees who sought nothing but Love from their Beloved. He did not enact this sacred <span class="char-style-override-6">Līlā</span> for the sake of enjoyment or for the satisfaction of the sexual desire of the Gopīs. There could be no desire for enjoyment in the All-blissful Lord nor could there be any trace of lust in the Gopīs. Nay, this <span class="char-style-override-6">Līlā</span> was enacted in order to destroy the seed of lust in the hearts of worldly men. While concluding the description of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Rāsa</span>-dance in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhāgavata,</span> the great ascetic śukadeva said:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">     “Men of wisdom who hear or read this story of love-sport of the damsels of Vraja with Bhagavān Viṣṇu (śrī Kr̥ṣṇa) will soon attain supreme devotion to the Lord and will be rid of the disease of the heart known by the name of lust.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>

That the sport of the Lord in Vraja was most sacred, is very well-known to all devotees following the path of Love; that was the reason why a celestial sage like Nārada and the greatest of Gods, śiva, were initiated into the Gopī-consciousness to participate in that sport. The great sage śukadeva narrated the story of this to king Parīkṣit, who was awaiting his death, in order to enable the latter to attain this transcendent devotion without much difficulty, and realize God after knowing the ultimate truth about Him. Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa also while describing the stages of Knowledge finally leading to transcendent devotion, says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">     “When man endowed with pure Reason, dwelling in solitude, abstemious in food, with mind, speech and body subdued, firmly established in dispassion, constantly fixed in meditation, controlling the self by firm determination, renouncing the objects of the senses, such as sound, etc., having abandoned the feelings of attraction and repulsion and shaken off egoism, violence, arrogance, lust, anger and the instinct of possession, regards nothing as his own and becomes tranquil, then he becomes qualified for realization of Brahma. Thus attaining Brahma, he is always cheerful. He neither grieves for nor desires anything and, beholding the Lord equally in all beings, is blessed with supreme devotion to Me. Through that devotion he knows the reality about Me, as to who and what I am in essence. Having known the truth about Me through that transcendent devotion he gets absorbed into Me.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">On a careful examination, all the above stages will be found in their complete state of development in the Gopīs. There can be no better proof of the purity of their reason than the fact that their reason was constantly attached to śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. Dwelling in solitude, not only physically but also mentally, with a view to obtaining the contact of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, forgetting even food and drink, withdrawing the mind, speech and body from worldly objects and applying them to the service of the Beloved Lord, absence of attraction for objects of enjoyment, remaining constantly engaged in meditation of the beloved śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, keeping the heart full of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa by installing His image therein, renunciation of all objects of senses excepting those connected with śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, absence of attraction for and repulsion from objects in the worldly sense; laying down egoism, violence, arrogance, lust, anger and the sense of possession at the feet of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, absence of attachment not only for the hearthand home, but even for heavenly bliss and final beatitude; fixing the mind in śrī Kr̥ṣṇa’s Form and restraining it from running after worldly objects, and pining for union with śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, knowing Him to be an incarnation of <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span>—all these were found manifested in every single moment of the life of the Gopīs. Apart from this, it is also well-known that they were always immersed in an ineffable joy and did not lose their balance of mind through gain or loss of worldly objects, and that they saw śrī Kr̥ṣṇa in every creature on all sides. All these virtues which may be acquired by an aspirant after a long course of strenuous discipline were found in a state of natural development in the Gopīs; that is why Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa revealed his whole secret to them, manifested His true Form before them and, engaging in a divine sport with them, gave them His own Form. The difference between this state of the Gopīs and the state of the <span class="char-style-override-6">JÛānī</span> (one who has obtained enlightenment through Knowledge) lay in this that while the realization of the latter is based only on pure Reason, in the case of the former all their experiences were based on direct perception through the senses.

Stealing the hearts of His devotees by His transcendent Beauty and drawing them by the music of the flute, He called them unto Him and blessed them in every sense. A well-known <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> who had been blessed with divine vision and had entered into the spirit of the Gopīs said:—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">On the day the Lord granted the boon to the Gopīs who had worshipped Goddess Kātyāyanī with the object of attaining utmost nearness to śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, the Lord tested the purity and exclusiveness of Love of the Gopīs by robbing them of their garments. Thus, divesting them of all sense of separateness and finding them worthy of treading the path of stainless Love, He gave them assurance of union. To scent sin in the sport of robbing the clothes of the Gopīs is an indication of the sinful condition of the mind, which scents it. The individual soul <span class="char-style-override-6">(tmā)</span> cannot afford to have any privacy with the Oversoul <span class="char-style-override-6">(Paramātmā).</span> The veil between the individual soul and the <span class="char-style-override-6">Paramātmā</span> exists only in <span class="char-style-override-6">Māyā.</span> Who will like to conceal his parts from the Lord Himself, Who is the Soul of all souls? So long as one attempts to do so, he does not recognize the ubiquity of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Paramātmā,</span> and is, therefore, anxious to preserve intact his consciousness of individuality. This delusion of the Gopīs was dispelled by the removal of their clothes. They recognized śrī Kr̥ṣṇa as the <span class="char-style-override-6">Paramātmā,</span> and at once removing the veil of their separate individuality as <span class="char-style-override-6">Jīvas,</span> and shaking off the cloak of <span class="char-style-override-6">Māyā,</span> they came face to face with the Lord, the innermost soul of all that exists, in their naked purity. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Sometime after this incident the autumnal full moon appeared on the eastern horizon. The appointed time for meeting the Lord drew near. The cool and delightful autumnal night, blooming flowers and the nectarean silvery rays scattered by the orb of the full moon, all these combined to excite a hidden desire in the hearts of the Gopīs, and they began to crave for something which is ordinarily unobtainable. This craving was for union with śrī Kr̥ṣṇa.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Just then the maddening flute of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa sounded. The blessed and delightful music evoking Love that enchants the universe started its career from the sweet flute of the Enchanter, delighting in Self, completely gratified and eternally young, the Lord of the lords of <span class="char-style-override-6">Yoga,</span> the <span class="char-style-override-11">t</span>ranscendent Dancer. The great sage, śrī śukadeva, says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">“As soon as that love-exciting (exciting desire for union with śrī Kr̥ṣṇa) music entered their ears, the minds of all the damsels of Vraja became full of Kr̥ṣṇa. They immediately left their work and started to meet their dearest śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. On account of excessive eagerness none of them attempted to seek the company of fellow-girls during this night excursion. (Forgetting everything else, they ran post-haste individually from whatever condition they were at that time). They ran so quickly that all the way the beautiful rings in their ears shook and moved.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">On their love being excited, why did the Gopīs make for śrī Kr̥ṣṇa instead of approaching their respective husbands? There was reason for this. This love of theirs was not sexual love as it is ordinarily known in the world. They had the overpowering desire, rare even amongst <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogīs,</span> to meet śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, which compelled them in spite of themselves to run towards śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. The sound of the flute was an irresistible invitation sent by God for conferring on them the transcendent unbroken bliss. How could they ignore it? No one has the power to ignore it. How did the Flute sound, what was the sweep of its note?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">     “The sacred divine music of that Flute, flooding the whole of Vr̥ndāvana with its soul-enthralling nectarean melody, rose to the heavens and arrested the motion of the clouds; reaching Indra’s paradise, it startled, again and again, Tumburu, the chief musician of the Devas; in the abode of Brahmā (Brahmaloka) it disturbed the trance of great sages like Sanandana and surprised Brahmā Himself. Thus having conquered the whole of the upper regions it descended to the nether world and startling King Bali, the lord of the nether world, it thrilled the divine lord of serpents, Ananta or śeṣa, who began to shake His thousand heads. Thus penetrating the whole of this universe, the music of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa’s Flute spread throughout infinite space.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>

The Gopīs emerged successful out of this test. The wives of the ¤<span class="char-style-override-6">Rṣis</span> had failed on this very point and returned to their homes. The Gopīs did not give any reply this time either. The mention of their kith and kin did not arouse any attachment in their hearts for the worldly relations.

He said all this in order to test whether they were still attached to their families, or having snapped all worldly ties they had their minds fixed only in Him, the Divine Himself. The Gopīs did not utter a word even now.

The latter had doubtless realized that śrī Kr̥ṣṇa was God Himself; but they still had attraction for their homes.

They knew the Lord was the soul of the whole universe—their own soul, the soul of their husbands and their children, the soul of all.

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Carnality and illicit love cannot be conceived to exist in one who possesses these divine qualities. The Lord enacted the whole of this scene through the help of His Yogamāyā. The Lord is eternally pledged to fulfil the desires of His devotees; through His Yogamāyā things appeared to each one of His devotees as he or she would have them. It is through the power of this Yogamāyā (the Lord’s own eternal divine energy), that the Lord though unattached, carries on His sports of creation, preservation and destruction. Just as a magician hypnotizes his spectators at will and conjures up scenes of his own choice before them, in the same manner the Lord enacted various sports through Yogamāyā. śrī Rādhā was the embodied form of Yogamāyā. Another form of Yogamāyā He sent ahead of Himself to inform Kaṁsa about his advent, and through her help subsequently the Lord enacted the whole drama of divine sports in Vraja. When Brahmā stole the cowherd boys and calves, śrī Kr̥ṣṇa who was then to all appearances a child of five assumed Himself through the power of this Yogamāyā the forms of those cowherd boys and calves together with all their paraphernalia—clothes, horns, sticks, etc. At the age of six, through the power of the same Yogamāyā, He subdued the terrible snake Kāliya and drank off the forest conflagration. At the same age He enacted the sport of stealing the robes of the cowherd-maids of Vraja (who sought śrī Kr̥ṣṇa as their husband) in order to lift the veil of Māyā that screened them from the Lord and develop their capacity for complete surrender. It was through the influence of His Yogamāyā that śrī Kr̥ṣṇa when He was only a child of seven years appeared as a grown up lad to the eyes of the damsels of Vraja. It was through the power of this Yogamāyā, again, that the Lord appeared as sporting within the ring of the Rāsa-dance. It was through this Yogamāyā that each Gopī in the ring perceived the Lord of Gopīs beside her. Just as a child plays at its will with its reflection in a mirror, even so with the help of His Yogamāyā Bhagavān śrī Kr̥ṣṇa sported with the Gopīs, who were like so many shadows of His own form.*<span class="char-style-override-7"></span></p>

To the wrestlers He appeared as hard as the hardest stone, to the citizens of Mathurā He appeared as a superman, to women He appeared as the God of Love Himself, the Gopas saw Him as their kinsman, the wicked kings as their chastiser, His parents saw Him as their darling, Kaṁsa saw Him as Death itself, the ignorant regarded Him as a monster, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogīs</span> saw Him as the Supreme Reality, and the Yādavas saw Him as the supreme deity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">It was a divine sport of Love between God Himself, <span class="char-style-override-11">w</span>ho is all-sufficient and all-powerful, who is the Lord of the masters of <span class="char-style-override-6">Yoga</span> and possesses the six divine attributes, <span class="char-style-override-11">w</span>ho is the director of <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogamāyā</span> (who is capable of bringing the impossible into the region of possibility), the master of supreme bliss and a veritable wish-yielding tree on the one hand, and His devotees who were His own shadows, on the other.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">In reality, śrī Kr̥ṣṇa is always inseparable from śrī Rādhā. śrī Rādhā is śrī Kr̥ṣṇa’s own bliss aspect which assumes a separate body in order to enjoy the transcendent love and beauty of the Lord; and the Gopīs, who are the eternal friends and associates of śrī Rādhā, are none else than so many manifestations of a particular class of infinite energies <span class="char-style-override-6">(śaktis)</span> whose office is to help and supplement His bliss aspect.

By Gopīs are meant śrī Rādhā, or the bliss aspect of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, and Her companions, who are eternally engaged in bringing about the union of Rādhā and Kr̥ṣṇa, and who through that effort enjoy happiness which is even intenser in experience than the bliss enjoyed by śrī Rādhā.

<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">    “Just as there are the gross, subtle and causal bodies of men, even so there is a fourth species known as the <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhāva-Deha</span> (body made of the purest Love); this body is attained through God’s grace, and is easily obtained from birth to birth through His grace. This <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhāva-Deha</span> is generally possessed by liberated souls who have the privilege of eternally waiting upon the Lord, or by the Lord’s own representatives whose function is to carry out God’s purpose on earth. Or, occasionally, O supreme Goddess, this body may be attained by a soul even by spiritual discipline. This <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhāva-Deha</span> is neither subject to <span class="char-style-override-6">Guṇas</span> (due to <span class="char-style-override-6">Karma</span>) nor is it beyond the <span class="char-style-override-6">Guṇas (Nirguṇa);</span> it is a body purely divine in essence, which is found only in Vr̥ndāvana and nowhere else. The Gopīs attained their object through their union with śrī Kr̥ṣṇa: this union was neither actuated by lust, nor was it entirely free from desire. It was a union brought about by the instrumentality of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhāva-Deha.</span>”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3" xml:lang="hi-IN">From these words of śrī śiva it is quite evident that the love between śrī Kr̥ṣṇa and the Gopīs was purely divine in its nature. The union of the Gopīs with śrī Kr̥ṣṇa was not of the earthly gross or physical type. There was not the least play or exercise of the organs of sense in the union. Therefore, it is a heinous crime to detect sin in this divine sport of Love.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break" xml:lang="hi-IN"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8" xml:lang="hi-IN">Privilege and Duty</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">It has, however, to be specially borne in mind that none else than the Lord Himself can conduct this sport. The privilege of worshipping God through the sentiment of the Gopīs is open to all <span class="char-style-override-6">Jīvas</span> who have developed dispassion and pure Love. It is not confined to women alone, nor is it necessary for men who desire to cultivate this love, to dress themselves as women. What is necessary is to accept the Gopīs as the model of this love, and to stimulate within one’s heart the kind of love possessed by them. It is the proper attitude of mind and not a particular form of dress that counts in this form of worship. He alone that possesses this divine, disinterested and undivided Love, may worship God through the sentiment of the Gopīs. Of course, the object of worship would be none else than God Himself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Those who worship God through the sentiment of the Gopīs, recognize all beings through their <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhāva-Deha</span> as females <span class="char-style-override-6">(Prakr̥ti),</span> and the only male, the transcendent, ever-youthful captivator of their hearts is the child of the ‘Lord of Vraja’ (Nanda) <span class="char-style-override-11">w</span>ho is the sole husband—the Supreme Lord of all. They cannot conceive of any other male than the Darling of Nanda. A supremely faithful wife, says Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa, knows of no other male than her own wedded husband. In the region of this Divine Love no other male than śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, and no other female than the devotee, whose thoughts are immersed in the nectar of Love for śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, is privileged, or has the capacity, to enter. The gate of this divine temple of Love inhabited by the <span class="char-style-override-11">b</span>lissful Energy of the Lord is totally closed against ordinary men and women of the world. One who seeks to enter this transcendent region has to show his permit to the divine lady who keeps watch at the gate. This permit, again, which is nothing else than an intellect immersed in the nectar of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa’s love, can be obtained by him alone who surrenders his body, mind and possessions to  the beloved Lord, who renounces all his desires, who has subdued all his passions such as lust, anger, greed, and so on, and clothed with dispassion and adorned with divine virtues, offers himself as sacrifice at the altar of Love. A Hindi poet says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">“First he offers his head, then he </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">enters;</p>

If, therefore, anyone assuming śrī Kr̥ṣṇa’s role calls upon others to worship him according to the spirit of the Gopīs, one should keep at a respectable distance from such a pretender. Specially one who suggests that women should worship him in the way of the Gopīs should be treated  as a rake and a debauchee.

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">सेइ जन पाय व्रजे व्रजेन्द्रनन्दन॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">The poet says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">A true lover does not repudiate the Vedic laws; on the contrary, when Divine Love manifests itself in him the Vedic laws themselves leave their hold on him, knowing that he has attained that Love in which lies their supreme fulfilment. He who deliberately repudiates the Vedic laws is bound to suffer a spiritual fall.</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">“There is one law governing this </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">Love, namely, that laws no longer</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">bind the votary.</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">But he who repudiates the laws</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">knowingly, does not possess this </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">Love.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">* एक नेम यह प्रेम को, नेम सबै छुटि जाहिं।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">पै जो छाँडै जानि कै, तहाँ प्रेम कछु नाहिं॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">This path is not for those who hanker after sensual pleasures, nor is it meant for those who simply put on the garb of a devotee. This sacred path is trodden by those selfless souls who having conquered the attractions of the world and curbed all desires seek to worship God alone. Any attempt on the part of those who entertain in their hearts the craving for enjoyment to tread this path would be as dangerous as to leap into a blazing fire, or to put one’s finger into the mouth of a deadly snake. The poet again says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">     “One who seeks to drink the nectar of Love and is yet attached to the enjoyments of the world will find that the poisonous effect of this attachment  spreads throughout his system, burns his heart and shatters his whole frame.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">* प्रेम अमिय पीयौ चहै, करै विषय सों नेह।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">बिष ब्यापै, जारै हियौ, करै जरजरित देह॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">That is why śrī śukadeva warns all against this danger when he says:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">     “śrī śiva drank the deadly poison, everyone cannot do it; in the same manner God Himself enacted this sport (of the Rāsa-dance), man can never imitate this act of His. A frail mortal should never therefore even think of imitating this sport. Anyone attempting this through foolishness will surely perish. God is the soul of the Gopīs as well as of their husbands, nay of all embodied beings. He dwells in the heart of everyone as the witness; it was by way of sport that He appeared on this earth in human form, and in order to shower His  grace  on the mortals inhabiting this globe enacted these supernatural sports through that Divine Body so that men may get devoted to Him by dwelling on those sports in their minds.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">* नैतत् समाचरेज्जातु मनसापि ह्यनीश्वर:।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">विनश्यत्याचरन्मौढ्याद्यथा रुद्रोऽब्धिजं विषम्॥</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">गोपीनां तत्पतीनाञ्च सर्वेषामेव देहिनाम्।</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Right-English">(<span class="char-style-override-6">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span> X. xxxiii, 31, 36-37)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">Therefore, instead of imitating these supernatural sports of the Lord one should place before him the ideal of the Gopīs, and, offering his all to God, should serve <span class="char-style-override-11">h</span>im through the intellect, the mind and the senses, and lovingly remember Him at all times: he should aspire to become a devotee of God, and not God Himself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">The soul <span class="char-style-override-6">(Jīva)</span> is a fragment of God, therefore, it contains the element of bliss—it is a part of the Bliss-aspect of God. Should one withdraw this particle of joy from the transient and ephemeral objects of enjoyment, which through error of judgment appear pleasant to us, though rooted in sorrow, and direct it towards the everlasting beauty and sweetness of God, he can attain that eternal and unlimited joy, the joy of Divine Love, in place of the transitory, illusive and trivial sense-enjoyment. When this faculty of joy possessed by man gets purified and elevated, it assumes its real character and is freed from the taint of desire, and begins to long for a taste of the nectarean beauty and sweetness of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa; so long as this faculty of joy remains merged in the enjoyments of the senses, it does not turn its face towards śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. Therefore, shaking off all attachments for worldly enjoyments one should constantly hear and sing with greatest reverence the story of the sports of śrī Rādhā and śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, and accepting anyone of the female companions of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa as his preceptor should meditate according to her directions on śrī Kr̥ṣṇa’s sports till one loses consciousness of his body and mind and gets absorbed in Divine Love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English" xml:lang="hi-IN">This scrappy exposition of the Love of the Gopīs based on facts collected at  random from the scriptures has been rather a dry presentation of that Love which is full of the delicious juice of divine sentiments. It is something beyond the reach of ordinary individuals; it cannot be described through human speech, nor can it be portrayed by the pen. What we should do is to adore the sacred feet of the blessed Gopīs, who are love incarnate, and beg of them the gift of this Love and fulfil our human birth through chanting the Name and singing the glory of their dear śyāmasundara (śrī Kr̥ṣṇa). Says śrī Lalita Kiśorī:—</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">“Damn all other work if your hands </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">are not kept busy in decorating the </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">Divine Forms of śyāmā and śyāma </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">(Rādhā-Kr̥ṣṇa).</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">If you have never had the good </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">fortune of washing the sacred feet </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">of the blessed couple and drinking </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">the water so used, damn all other </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">cold drinks.</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">If you have never had the opportunity</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">of rambling in the avenues and </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">bowers of Vr̥ndāvana,</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">Accursed be the joy of having a </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">pleasure-drive in other gardens.</p>
<p class="Shlok-English">Accursed be this life itself, as </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">throughout its long years these eyes </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">have not been able to behold the </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">blessed form of the Beloved of my </p>
<p class="Shlok-English">heart.”<span class="char-style-override-7">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-4" xml:lang="hi-IN">* रुचि कर सँवारे नाहिं अंग-अंग स्यामा-स्याम,</p>

<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3" xml:lang="hi-IN">śyāmasundara is present even today, His sports also are eternal. But how shall we get to see Him, how can we earn the proud privilege of washing His sacred feet? The method is to mutter His Name constantly and lovingly in a disinterested way, to sing His glories, to associate with His devotees, to act in conformity with His wishes, to obey His commands, to acquiesce in his dispensation, to conquer the attractions of the world, and to learn to immolate oneself at the altar of His beauty and sweetness, to meditate on His sports and to weep for His Darśana from the bottom of the heart. If you really want Him then renounce all worldly attachments and adopt the methods indicated above. Through constant practice the sentiment will grow from within, and you will realize śrī Kr̥ṣṇa as the be-all and end-all of your life. Glory be to the Gopīs, and blessed be the dust of the Lotus-feet of the Lord of the Gopīs!<span></span></p>
