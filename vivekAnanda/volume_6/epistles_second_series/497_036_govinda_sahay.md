## XXXVI

MOUNT ABU,  
*30th April, 1891*.

DEAR GOVINDA SAHAY,

Have you done the Upanayana of that Brahmin boy? Are you studying
Sanskrit? How far have you advanced? I think you must have finished the
first part. ... Are you diligent in your Shiva Pujâ ? If not, try to be
so. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all good things will be added
unto you." Follow God and you shall have whatever you desire. ... To the
two Commander Sahebs my best regards; they being men of high position
were very kind to a poor fakir like me. My children, the secret of
religion lies not in theories but in practice. To be good and to do good
— that is the whole of religion. "Not he that crieth 'Lord', 'Lord', but
he that doeth the will of the Father". You are a nice band of young men,
you Alwaris, and I hope in no distant future many of you will be
ornaments of the society and blessings to the country you are born in. 

Yours with blessings,

V.

  
PS. Don't be ruffled if now and then you get a brush from the world; it
will be over in no time, and everything will be all right.
