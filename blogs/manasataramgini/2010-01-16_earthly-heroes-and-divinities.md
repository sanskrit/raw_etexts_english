The three figures to the left are identified as the 3 peshvA-s:  
bAlAjI vishvanath: The hero who took the saffron dhvaja back to
indraprastha which had been defiled by the turuShka-s for 600 years.  
bAjirAv: The hero who brought the turuShka-s to their heels.  
chimnAjI appA: The hero who sent the pretAcharin-s to enjoy vaivasvata’s
company and restored the vajreshvarI temple.

Of course further to the right are nR^isiMha rending the son of diti and
mahiShamardinI laying another of them low. Above her stands rudra.
