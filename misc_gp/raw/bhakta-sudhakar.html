<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">The Devotee-Ramachandra</p>
<p class="Text">A Brahman family lived in a village in South on the bank of Urna river near Karavira (present Kolhapur). The family consisted of the couple of wife-husband and the third one was an infant. By the professional occupation of a Brahman, the householder pulled on. There was a basil plant in the house, the Lord Shaligram was worshipped regularly. The wife was obedient, the husband gave due importance to his wife’s interest. The both were righteous and mindful of their duty and was there the informal love of high Hindu ideals. By the grace of the Lord, there was already a child also. The couple was very happy. But the times change. The bright day of happiness suddenly changes into the sorrow of the last day of the dark fortnight. Man thinks of the only happy days, there will be never end of the happy days, the intoxication of the wine of love will never be inaffective. Throughout the life the intoxication will continue. But the God disposes what man proposes. The same tree of life-support which is watered with what a great hope, with what a depth of inner love, with the water of whole-hearted affection full of nectar, disturbs the entire wires of heart suddenly. The wheel of birth and death moves round all the twenty-four hours and announces very clearly—‘This life is transient, pleasure is momentary and the hope and expectation result in utter sorrow.’ Once, cholera broke out in the village with a great force and in no time the idol of heart, his wife passed away. The Brahman’s anguish of heart was beyond limit. The infant deprived of his mother, was also in a miserable condition. After a few days, the Brahman also died of cholera helplessly abandoning the suckling child of two and half years old. He had attachment with the child but he was helpless before the inevitable death.</p>
<p class="Text">A Sadhu lived nearby the village. He was a perfect saint. God knows how he was inspired. He had no sense of mineness. In his experience, the mercy also was a worth abandoning as mentality of illusion only. But the news of the Brahman-couple’s death and the miserable condition of the orphan child inspired mercy in his mind even if it might be the mentality of attachment. The Sadhu rushed up and brought the child in his hut. He began to bring up him pouring down the affection of thousands of mothers. Now, it became his main work to bathe, feed, make him drink the milk and to look after him. This was the Lord’s frolicsome play.</p>
<p class="Text">The great soul’s hut was in a secluded place. Just below the hut a river flowed. There was pleasant forest all around it. There was quiet Sattvic atmosphere. There was no trace of prurience, anger, greed, untruth and violence at all. None of despicable actions and vicious mentality happened even to come there. The objects of enjoyments and luxuries could not be imagined in dream even, there was purity and simplicity in meals. The time and measure of going to bed and getting up in the morning, taking meal and rest etc., were fixed. Most important point was that the performence of the Lord’s adoration, divine narrations and the Lord’s meditation day and night was there. Before mind and sense-organs there was never any such sight which may create the possibility of any modification. Prurience, anger, untruth and violence are not the instincts of mind and the evilsome efforts of the sense-organs are not instinctive. These are the defilements—these evils are grafts which are created with vicious company and accordingly increasing by endeavours make their such a place in the consciousness that they are apart from the consciousness is not realized at all. It seems that these are the natural and general characteristics of mind and sense organs, as if they are natural. So, since the very birth due to the influence of the parents alertness, the holy atmosphere of the saint’s hermitage and the association of the saintly persons, no evil could affect him. The old evil tendencies also decayed and mostly destroyed. He remained as if unacquainted with the bad deeds, evil thoughts and vice mentality. Besides teaching him, the Mahatma kept him engaged in spiritual disciplines also. God knows whether it was due to any relation of the previous birth or purely the divine inspiration. Mahatmaji wanted to pour down his entire spiritual practice—the enlightenment, in the stainless heart of the child at same time. As the result, the child became a great spiritual aspirant merely at the age of sixteen. Non-violence, truth, love, self-restraint had became his nature. The stream of the Lrod’s devotion emerged from his own innerself and began to purify all and sundry. His speech became infallible by the virtue of truth and his every desire became fruitful due to the glory of sacrifice and self-restraint. He became a true saint inwardly and outwardly both. His face shone with the radiant glow of Brahma.</p>
<p class="Text">The lfie-span of all is fixed. Mahatmaji’s life-span also came to an end. Smiling, he went away to the divine abode having abandoned this transient world. The child became without shelter no doubt, but by the grace of Mahatmaji, he did not feel sorrow. He accepted the divine dispensation with a reverent and peaceful mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Mahatmaji used to call him ‘Ranganatha’. He became famous by the same name. He spent the whole day and night in divine adoration and meditation. Whatever he got by divine mercy, he pulled on with that much. Every moment of his life was devoted to the Lord’s service. The repute of his penance spread over far and wide. The people began to visit for his sight. He fixed one watch of the day for divine talks. He passed the rest time in seclusion.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, one afflicted man came to Ranganatha. He narrated his sorrow to him privately. His grief was the desire of wealth. Undoubtedly, Rangnathaji shared his sorrow but he said to himself, ‘He is feeling grieved by his own misunderstaning. If the riches could provide happiness, all those possessing plenty of riches must be happy in life. But they are also found unhappy in their life. Really, the cause of sorrow is—discontentment due to ignorance. If it is removed, then a man in any condition according to his destiny can live a happy life. Ranganathaji tried to convince him. He told him everything with great love. But he was not satisfied. He said—‘If you say only once with your tongue, I will become affluent, I will feel obliged.’ Ranganathaji said—‘Brother! First, what does it mean if I say, secondly, when I see apparently and experience it that excess of wealth will increase your sorrow and not decrease the least; then, actually if I want your welfare, then you should get that may cause you trouble, why can I wish you so? Side by side, there is one thing more, to get riches, is the matter of your destiny. I don’t know about your past actions those have become obstacle in getting riches. If suppose, I say and you don’t get the riches, then, your faith in the Lord can shatter. So, brother! Do one thing—seeking shelter to the Lord with all being put your all the problems and the whole situation before Him and pray to Him to do for you whatever He thinks good for you. In fact, still He is intent in our well-being. But we have no faith and that is the cause of our sorrow. Brother! Remain happy in the Lord’s will. He is benevolent.’ Thus, even after great persuation when he was not satisfied. The great austere, Ranganatha asked him to close his eyes once. When he closed his eyes what he saw that his familiar very rich persons whom he considered very happy—are burning in the fierce flaming fire of the hell. One of them is saying—‘It is true, this is the terrible result of wealth. I had become arrogant being mad with wealth. I gave no importance to anyone. As the prosperity expanded, so my greed grew. I grabbed the property of others by deceit, force and cunningness. I was popular as righteous and happy among the people. But infact then also I was burning and today what a fierce torture I am suffering through this hell-fire which is known to me only. Anyone who wants to get rid of sorrow, should not be greedy of wealth leading this dreadful result. Instead of claiming his own right on the wealth and property earned by the justified and truthful means, he should consider it the belonging of the Lord and go on using it in the service of the destitutes and afflicted beings gladly. Fifteen vices had been cropped in me due to wealth—hypocrisy, arrogance, egotism, anger, violence, attachment, infatuation, greed, prurience, untruth, obstinate, error, bad company, gambling, luxury and sensuous attachment. I don’t know what wrongs I had done in the intoxication of wealth. At that time, I was ignorant of this dreadful result of my actions. But today, I am suffering from the tortures of the hell as its fruit. As a matter of fact, a man needs the money only to pull on his living. The greed of more money is due to hunger for sensuous enjoyments. At that time, I was in the darkness of this fact. Now, O Lord! If I am released from here, then only I can get rid of this pain.’ The second one said—‘I was very rich, to hoard money by any means had become single object of my life. I never used my riches in the service of the poors. Before this, I was a snake and now, I am suffering in this miserable condition.’ Some souls of the hell narrated other many stories. Then all the souls suffering from the tortures of hell began to weep bitterly. Their wailing was heart-touching. It was a very pathetic sight. Then after suddenly this sight became invisible. His eyes, opened. He saw—Mahatma Ranganatha is seeing towards him with a very pathetic look and smiling. The sight what he had seen and the graceful sight of the devotee Ranganathaji had a very impressive impact on him. There was already the natural effect of the Sattvic atmosphere of the hermitage and ‘Satsanga’ on him. By the Lord’s grace, his desire of wealth vanished. He said—‘Gurudeva! Tell me such a means that my human birth may be worthful. Now, I don’t want wealth, name and fame. I want—Lord’s love and unadulterated devotion of the Lord. Be kind to me.’ His name was Ramachandra. Ranganath became very happy to see the change of his heart. He got exhilarated to see the apparent influence of the Lord’s grace. He said—‘Brother Ramachandra! So long as the mind is attached to the sensuous enjoyments, the darkness is not removed and so long as the darkness continues, he cannot be free from sorrow and distress and the detachment from the sensuous enjoyments can be possible only by the company of the truly detached and Lord’s loving saints. Actually, there should be love towards God. Devotion is not possible without detachment from the sensual enjoyments. In case there is attachment with sensuous objects how does the love in the Lord can develop and where there is no love, why will there be endevour to attain Him? The fact is that the Lord only is the support of our life, our most intimate, eternal companion of joy and sorrow, and is our own. It is He the dearest One. If, He is recognised and known once, our heart cannot remain without being attracted towards Him. Such is He, the dearest of our soul, the ocean of beauty, charm, affection and generosity. Only once, He should be recognised, the innerself will cry for Him automatically. It will become very difficult to take rest even for a moment without attaining Him. Nothing will appeal to our mind. Leaving everything—breaking all the ties, all the bents of mind will start flowing towards Him speedily and tempestuous velocity in the single direction. The separation of a single moment even will be unbearable. Such a condition is the prior form of the perfect accomplishment of human life. Man should make his best effort for this only in his life. Its course is the devotional adoration of the Lord. I tell you just the twelve letters-spell—Go on muttering this spell with love and devotion and with the purity of heart daily as much as you can do having abandoned the attachment of the honour, prestige, lady, gold, name and fame, as much as possible. The spell is—<span class="char-style-override-1">‘ॐ नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय।’</span> ‘Be alert! Many allurements may try to deviate you, but never fall into the trap of temptation. The Lord is benevolent, if you are truly dedicated, He will oblige you with His vision.’</p>
<p class="Text">Ramachandra also was yet unmarried. He had some money as heritage of his father as heir, but his ambition was to become very rich first by any means, and then to marry and enjoy. His mental bent was more on sensuous enjoyment and comforts than duly lead the life of a householder. Rather to say that he wanted to amass money only for the comforts and luxurious lustful life of enjoyment, he made many efforts. He used to do whatever anyone suggested. At last, he had come to the devotee Ranganathaji to hear his veracity of words by the influence of some virtuous deeds of the previous life and only by his infallible company he could come out of delusion. He came to be awakened and coming back home according to the suggestion of the saint, he devoted himself in the muttering of the ‘Dwadas Mantra’ to get the Lord’s grace. As much was the muttering so much his pleasure began to increase. Now, the Lakshmi (riches) who was maintaining a long distance from him, began to come close to him uncalled, but he was firm on his vow. As much as he avoided and wanted to remain detached from the sensuous enjoyments so much close the sensuous objects happened to fall on his feet. But he never cast his look at them. The men, the gods tempted him with the allurements of land, house, palace, wife, son, riches, property, name and fhonour and prestige. All the allurements were as if apparently ready in his service, but he gave up them as a man gives up his vomitting.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">रमा बिलासु राम अनुरागी।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तजत बमन जिमि जन बड़भागी॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘The Tulasidasji says—Most fortunate persons dedicated to the Lord Rama’s feet give up the prosperity and luxury like the vomitting thrown out of the mouth.’</p>
<p class="Text">His dedicated worship proved fruitful. One day, after Sandhya (morning, noon and evening worship), he was muttering the Supreme ‘Mantra’ of the Lord in meditation at a secluded place, the Lord Narayana Himself appeared before him. Ramachandraji was absorbed in the joy of meditation. Ultimately by the Lord’s inspiration his eyes opened and he got flourished to see the divine appearance of the Lord, the protector of saints. He began to drink the nectar of His charming appearance without the wink of eye. He was not getting satiated by anyway. After a long time, he came to speak and he began to eulogise the Lord. Being pleased, the Lord blessed him His love-devotion. His life became fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Text-Black para-style-override-5">‘Jai to the devotee and his Lord!’<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">The Devotee-family</p>
<p class="Text">Devotee Lakhaji was Gaud Brahmana by caste. His house was situated in a small village of Rajputana. Lakhaji was not much educated. But he had memorised <span class="char-style-override-2">Vishnusahastranam </span>and <span class="char-style-override-2">Gita</span> and he had undaunted faith in the Lord. His profession was farming. His wife Khemabai was a great saintly and chaste-lady. She supported her husband in the farming also besides doing all the domestic chores; and without her husband’s service, her vow of daily routine remained incomplete. Daily, in the morning after taking bath, she used to drink the water after washing his toe of the right foot. Lakhaji felt hesitated and he forbade her also but he was helpless before the insistence of Khemabai. He had two issues—One son and one daughter. The son’s name was Deva and the daughter’s name was Gangabai. There was no hurry for the son’s marriage but the God-fearing Brahman was much worried for his daughter’s marriage. After efforts, he was successful in getting a worthy bridegroom in a neighbouring village. The bridegroom’s father was a contented Brahmana. The relation was settled and on time marrying her daughter Gangabai with fond, Lakhaji sent to her husband’s house. At this time, Gangabai was twelve years old. Deva was elder but he was married two years after the marriage of his daughter. The daughter-in-law entered the house. Her name was Lichhami. She was by her nature apparently Lakshmi incarnate. Thus, Lakhaji was happy in all respects. It was the rule of Lakhaji to recite the whole of the <span class="char-style-override-2">Gita </span>daily in the morning and in the night before going to bed to go through fifty recitations <span class="char-style-override-2">Vishnusahastranam</span>. His mouth recited the hymns and his hands remained busy in work. This rule was formed by his father when he was merely ten years old and it continued for his whole life without any break. This was the rule that provided the great treasure of faith in the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Always days are not the same. It is not known what role does destiny play in changing the time and days. The son-in-law of Lakhaji was bitten by snake and according to the God’s will he passed away only in the young age of twenty-five leaving his twenty-two years old wife and his parents behind him—When Lakhaji got this news, calling his wife Khemabai, son and daughter-in-law—to him he said with great patience—‘See, from worldly point of view it is a matter of great sorrow for us. It is not the cause of sorrow so much that our son-in-law died. Life and death depends on our fate, it is inevitable. Really, the cause of great sorrow is that the life of Gangabai became more miserable. If we may remove the sorrow of Gangabai with our behaviour and conduct, our entire sorrow will disappear. The means to make her free from sorrow is to bring her here and try to devote her in the Lord’s service by setting the example of self-detachment from the sensuous enjoyments. The enjoyment of sensuous objects cannot remove our sorrow and neither there is sorrow basically in the destruction of sensuous objects. The cause of sorrow is our ambition. There may not be a single object of enjoyment, there may be scarcity of our essential objects of need even but if there is no feeling of scarcity in the mind and it is satisfied always and the mind is free from any desire, there will be no sorrow at all. Similarly, if there is the abundance of the objects of enjoyments even, so long as there is the feeling of want of anything and there exists the longing to achieve it, sorrow cannot be removed. If by our efforts we succed in making Gangabai forget the memories of her husband from her mind and in developing her love to ever existent Supreme Lord’s feet, she can be happy. Although, all the worldly relations are confined only to the body, yet, so long as the relation is, our mututal behaviour should be such as may attach our mind to the Lord, detaching it from the sensuous enjoyments and we may attain the most propitious Supreme Lord. The true well-wisher are those parents, son, brothers, wife, husband who turn their offsprings, parents, brothers, sisters, husband and wife ahead towards unthinkable and blissful God releasing from the world-trap of endless sorrow. We should also try to assist Gangabai to cross the world-sea of sorrow ourselves being free from sorrow.</p>
<p class="Text">Lakhaji’s wife, his son, Deva and his daughter-in-law had full faith in the words of Lakhaji. They were his followers in all respects, so, these words of Lakhaji influenced them very much and they said—‘Better you bring Gangabai here, in accordance with your order having abandoned our all enjoyments we will turn her towards Lord. It will lead to our highest good and to her as well as to all.’</p>
<p class="Text">Lakhaji went to the house of his daughter’s father-in-law and he was taken aback to see the situation there. He saw—‘Gangabai is consoling her mother-in-law and father-in-law explaining them the secret of this transient world and false relation and being convinced with her logic they are collectively singing divine names shedding off their tears. To see his daughter’s such a state of being, Lakha’s sorrow turned into joy. He experienced nectar as if transformed from poison. He met the father-in-law of his daughter, to see him their ocean of sorrow swelled, but just remembering Gangabai’s sermons they became quiet. The father-in-law said to Lakhaji—‘Lakhaji! You are blessed that such a saintly daughter was born to you. You must be realizing the shock of a young son’s death and for a woman the separation of her husband absolutely unbearable, but a great praiseworthy is your daughter, who endured the separation of her husband, herself through wisdom and gave such sermons to us also that we got rid of the terrible grief of son’s death. We came to understand the reality of life that all the worldly relations are feigned. Just as the people come in different dramatic performances and go away after playing their roles, similarly we appear on the stage of the world in different roles, connect our relations and after playing our roles we go away behind the curtain. Here, none is son or father. The only Supreme Lord is our father. All of us should adore Him only. You have reached here—take away your this saintly daughter to your home. Both of us—wife and husband want to pass our rest of life in the devotional song of the Lrod going to Pushkararaj. Your daughter insists upon accompanying us; but the Lord echoes in our mind that she should be with you. Yes, we want only this much that she should be doing good to us with her sentiments. You should go, we are very much obliged to you; because your daughter has opened our eyes and she has provided us the unflinching devotion of the Lord by giving us a great treasure of the dispassionate discriminative faculty.’</p>
<p class="Text">Lakhaji got astonished to hear the words of his daughter’s father-in-law. His own dispassion and discrimination began to look faded before theirs. He forgot the death of his son-in-law. He felt a great joy to see the much higher state of his daughter, her mother-in-law and father-in-law than what he hoped to provide them. He sent his daughter’s mother-in-law and father-in-law to Pushkarraj. By selling their whole property whatever was there in the house, he gave them the cash for their livelihood and set out for his home with Gangabai.</p>
<p class="Text">To see Gangabai in a happy state Lakhaji asked—‘Daughter! I am getting amazed to see your such unique condition. I had come here with the various thoughts in mind how to console you, but I was astonished to see your state. Tell me daughter! How and where from did you get this wisdom?’ Gangabai said—‘Father! This is all the influence of your devotion and devotional song. The Lord blessed me with His grace and gave me confidence by the influence of your reading of the whole <span class="char-style-override-2">Gita</span> daily and fifty times your recital of the whole <span class="char-style-override-2">Vishnusahastranam</span>. By your grace, my elder brother and I, myself both had <span class="char-style-override-2">Vishnusahastranam </span>committed to memory. Coming here, whatever could be possible by me, I used to read the <span class="char-style-override-2">Vishnusahastranam</span> regularly to myself. Three days before the death of your son-in-law, the Lord appeared in my dream and said—‘Daughter! The span of your husband’s life has ended, he is My devotee. His association with you of the previous birth was still remaining, that is why he was born. Now, after three days the snake will bite him—then you keep relating him My <span class="char-style-override-2">‘Sahastranam’</span> and <span class="char-style-override-2">Gita</span>. By doing so it will lead to his highest good and he will attain My abode. I grant you boon that you will not feel remorseful. You will get the true knowledge and dispassion. By your sermons your mother-in-law and father-in-law will attain Me in the last being the traveller of of spiritual path path and you including your mother-father and brother and his wife remaining engaged in My devotion throughout your life, will attain My ‘Supreme abode.’ Father! Having uttered this the Lord disappeared. I woke up. As if since that moment, I was enlightened with knowledge. Being free from all the mourning and attachments, I engaged myself in the well being of my husband. I took the vow and remained relating the <span class="char-style-override-2">Gita</span> and <span class="char-style-override-2">Sahastranam</span> the whole night. The third day having taken bath my husband was watering the basil plant. I was reciting <span class="char-style-override-2">‘Sahastranam’</span> standing beside him, he was also remembering the Lord’s name. At the same moment, a black serpent came and bit him and in no time, he passed away through cracking the orifice of the uppermost point of the skull. In his last breath, I heard—‘O Narayanaa’ came out of his lips and the names of ‘Madhavo Bhaktvatsalah’ entered his ears. His eyes opened—I saw, the Lord present before his eyes in four armed form. In the meanwhile, there was a loud sound and his head cracked. Father! This death of my husband swelled the ocean of Lord’s devotion in my mind, now I am drowning into it. Please, help me so that I may remain sinking into it forever. I am confident you will support me.’</p>
<p class="Text">Lakha got thrilled with joy to hear the virtuous words of Ganga, the tears began to flow from his eyes.</p>
<p class="Text">The father and daughter came home, meeting with her mother, brother and brother’s wife, Gangabai rather consoled them beyond expectation. As regards, Lakhaji and Khemabai, engaged themselves in the Lord’s devotional song day and night since that day being completely detached from this world. Gangabai began to look after the whole household management. The brother and his wife did every work by her permission. She was the mistress of the house and was the clever guide to lead the brother and his wife on the path of the highest good saving them from the obstacles. The brother, Devaji and his wife, Lichhami served their mother and father according to the order of Gangabai, served Gangabai and fulfilled all the domestic works with their mind anchored in God and with the spirit of service to God every moment. They had sacrificed all the sensuous enjoyments and they passed the simple and self-restrained life. Their house had changed to the holy hermitage of the saints. The divine traits had become their natural property. In the house at both the times there used to be the adoration of child Krishna and after offering oblation to God all used to eat the remaining. Thus, the life of all of them became pious. After about twenty-five years Lakhaji and Khemabai abandoned their bodies on the same day remembering the Lord’s name before the Lord’s idol. Devaji performed their funeral rites and made offering in the name of the deceased’s according to the rules of the Shastras. The son, the daughter-in-law and the daughter recited <span class="char-style-override-2">‘Vishnusahastranam’</span> three thousand times for their welfare.</p>
<p class="Text">After the death of mother and father, the sister, brother and brother’s wife—all the three were engaged in the Lord’s devotion. On the earnest request of the brother and his wife, one day, Gangabai prayed to the Lord to show His appearance in the manifested form. The Lord heard the prayer and blessed all the three devotees with His divine sight having manifested Himself. All the three were fulfilled to see the apparent form of the Lord and devoting their rest life in the Lord’s service at last they went away to the divine abode.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">The Devotee-Govardhana</p>
<p class="Text">There lived a young Pandit, named Govardhan in Vishalapuri. The Brahman was of moral conduct, learned logician and somewhat proud of his knowledge. His wife was also a great saintly nature. She had faith and devotion in the Lord. Couple had mutually pure love. Despite not being very rich, they were very happy. A detached saint used to visit him off and on. Govardhanji’s father was the devotee of the saint. He had served him very much. The saint’s true service is to follow the path of purity instructed by him and not to imitate his outer appearance. Govardhan’s father was such a good servant. Only due to his relation, the saint used to visit his house off and on showing his grace. The saint did not visit his house for a quite some days. Govardhan’s neighbour was of a great vicious conduct and follower of evil course. He was jealous of Govardhan and wanted to deform him like his ownself; but due to the company of the saint intermittently there was no impact of gloominess on Govardhan’s mind and so the neighbourer Nandaram was not successful in his endevour.</p>
<p class="Text">Years passed that the saint had not visited him. Although, Govardhan was a learned man of moral conduct but not devoted to divine adoration. He was of a logical mind not a devotee of God; yet by saint’s company his evils of prurience anger etc., remained supressed. But in want of saintly association and in the bad company of Nandaram his supressed evils upsurged. By and by, Govardhan became drunkard, gambler and adulterer. His poor wife became very sad. She had deep anguish in her heart. She had faith in God. One day, she made a piteous prayer to God in her own mind with tears in her eyes—‘Lord! My husband has fallen into a bad company. The saint had not turned up since many days. You are the helper of the humble. Please be merciful to this humble woman. Cause to send the Mahatma here and reform my husband’s life. You are omnipotent, the ocean of grace, friendly to all the beings. You, yourself have said—‘By believing Me friendly to all the creatures, he gets peace at once. Lord! I accept You the well wisher of all. Kindly, bless me with peace.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord responds immediately to the true call. It may be male, female, Brahman, pariah, scholar, fool, whosoever whenever being afflicted, calls Him piteously with sincere heart, He listens to him at once and fulfils his ambition. It is our bad luck that not having faith in our such eternal companion and omnipresent, omnipotent loving friend and rely on the transient sensuous enjoyments and selfish world, in the days of hardships imploring humbly before that we make the poisonous serpent of disappointment and disgrace, the garland our heart.</p>
<p class="Text">The saint was living in seclusion in the state of trance far away on the bank of a river. Suddenly he thought of his devotee’s son, Govardhan. His heart became restless! ‘I didn’t visit Vishalpuri since long. God knows what would be the condition of Govardhana. Isn’t it so that he would have become the victim of bad company. Why is so much agitation in my mind again and again for him?’ The Mahatma’s mind had transcended the existence of the world and further he had lost consciousness of the mind also. There was not the sense of seer also. What remained who is the eternal; what is that, how is it? Who is there to expound? Neither is anyone worth knowing nor the knower. Well, being in onenessa with the eternal the Mahatma was in a state of unwavering-trance. Today, all at once, his trance broke and the memory of Govardhan haunted in his mind. Memory was so such as could not be ignored, not to go out of mind even after effort to forget. As if anything happenning due to same attachment. It was the inspiration of the Lord, the controller of the universe and and truthful; because the saintly wife of Govardhana had made the same prayer to the Lord to send the Mahatma and reform her husband’s life.</p>
<p class="Text">Mahatma set out straight for Vishalapuri, just as the arrow of a skilful man aiming at its goal goes straight to its object. He reached Vishalpuri, it was midnight then. The all-knowing Mahatma knew that through his all seeing eye Govardhan was at this time in the house of the prostitute, Mayawati in the locality, North of the city. He reached there directly. The outer door was open. Entering the house, he knocked at the door of the room and said—‘Govardhan! Open the door.’ In the intoxication of wine Govardhan was oblivious of his senses and he had no control on his ownself. He was extrovert; but he cold not ignore the words of the high souled Mahatma. The prostitute also could not dare to check him. Govardhan opened the door. It was a moonlit night. Just as opening the door, he saw a great soul with matted hair and of a mass of splendour. An affectionate cool and lustrous flow of nectar was coming out of his body and eyes. First, Govardhan was frightened a little, he felt a bit suspicious, some perturbance; but just the next moment, he recognised the Mahatma. His entire intoxication was knocked out. He shrieked and fell down on his feet.</p>
<p class="Text">What is impossible by the grace of the saint and the God? Even the vilest sinner becomes the foremost saint in a trice. O the innocent man! You are getting entangled into what a perilous whirlpool of illusion! There is pleasure in the worldly objects, what a false delusion is! Again and again you suffer a loss, face disappointment, fall down, get wounded yet you run to the same way due to attachment.</p>
<p class="Text">Mayawati was standing near the door. There was the influence of the infallible sight of the Mahatma. Her heart was also melting. All the sins of her life had appeared before her eyes as if in the manifested form. She came to tremble. The fierce fire of repentence broke out in her heart. The whole lump of sin was burnt to ashes. The cream of the sentiment of her heart melted and flowed through her eyes in the form of the tears-flow. It cannot be said whether it should be considered that her heart was purified or not; but she also moving ahead fell down on the feet of the Mahatma and began to wash his holy lotus feet with the flow of the tears of her eyes. The Mahatma’s boonful hand rose up. The Mahatma bent. His boonful hand touched the heads of the both and said—‘My children! Rise, don’t be perplexed. What is the standing of your sins before the Lord’s power of grace? The darkness may be thick or dense or it may be the of long period but it disappears immediately on the appearance of light. If sun rises there it does not even find place to hide itself. The divine grace is the fierce cool radiant sun never to hide. What is the capacity of the darkness to stand even for a moment before the sun? It is the Lord’s unparallel power of grace that has inspired me to come here in the mid of the night. Both of you are sanctified. Rise up! Practise the divine adoration and make your life fulfilled.’ The both rose and stood before him with folded hands like puppet. Their eyes had changed into the fountain of tears.</p>
<p class="Text">The Mahatma said—‘Govardhan! Go to your home and console your chaste wife. Since today this Mayavati is your sister. Consider her your own sister born of the same womb. Going to the bank of Kaveri, she will devote herself to God. Due to some bad company she met this downfall. Your father was great obedient to me, was a saint and a God-realized man. His virtuous tendencies were within you; but in the pride of knowledge you didn’t practise the Lord’s devotion. You remained refuting about the existence of the universe on the strength of arguments. You told even the Lord of divine illusion the embidement of  illusion. That is why you drowned in the ocean of sin like the boat without the boatman. Those who don’t seek the shelter of the immensely powerful Lord and feel proud of little knowledge of gambol  being overturned, they have to face downfall. The darkness exists only where there is no light. If from the beginning, the divine, cool, affectionate light of the Lord’s shelter is illuminated and maintain it illuminating as it is forever and watering it with the stainless affection and love of firm faith, there can never be the entrance of the darkness of sin. Without sin there is no affliction. The thieves and robbers enter only when there is darkness.</p>
<p class="Text">‘You didn’t call the Lord even today, didn’t seek His shelter. But your wife in a great devotee. She has unshakable faith in the Lord. Her restless call of faith shook the Lord’s throne and He inspired me awakenning from the trance to come here. I came here with the virtual inspiration of the Lord; that is why whatever the long cherished heap of immoral and vicious conduct was there in the heart of both of you, was destroyed so soon like the destruction of the darkness with the pungent brightness of the sun. With the vision of God all sins get destroyed, nothing to say about this. Only the desire to meet the God burns all the sins to ashes. Getting the sight of the God’s inspiration inadvertently through me, you have been fulfilled. This is the exhibit of the boundless grace of the Lord. In the achievement of this grace the cause is your saintly wife. You didn’t call the Lord but your saintly wife made the call with full faith. Her prayer was—‘May the Lord, the friend of humbles reform you through me showing His grace!’ It happened so, I was in the state of trance. Why did I come here? Having awakened me, the power of Lord’s grace subjugated by the saintly lady Brahmin, sent me here. They are the true intimate, well-wisher, brother and dear who direct them on the true path of the Lord having released from the poisonous effect of the liquor of the sensuousness, diverting from the evil deeds and cause him to drink the nectar of Lord’s devotion by making prayer in pathetic words. Blessed is your wife and you are also blessed that you got such a wife. Savitri had released her husband, Satyavan from the noose of the Lord Yama. But your saintly wife saved you from the numerous endless deaths by releasing you from going to numberless births after births. What is impossible for a chaste wife? </p>
<p class="Text">This Mayawati was a great devotee in her previous birth. Here, also she was born in a pious Brahmin family. But after the death of her parents and husband, the depraved men got her trapped in their trap. She was innocent, simple-hearted, so she fell into the bad company easily. The bad company that made your downfall, was the cause of her downfall also. What is that evil which is impossible by the bad company and what is that downfall which can be impossible? The foolish men in greed of money push themselve into the deep pit of the downfall by chopping off their own hands and feet. Mayawati met a downfall due to bad company. But the fire of repentence was burning in her heart. There are two kinds of evil doers. First they are those who sink into the mud of sin falling into bad company due to circumstances, but that sin always pricks their heart like thorn. They inflame in the fire of repentence and groaning, they go on remembering the Lord, the purifier of the downfallen. The second one are those who feel proud of themselves by considering their competence, cleverness and success of life in doing the sinful acts. Such men are victim of different kinds of sorrows and sufferings in the dreadful hell-tortures and the hellish species of birth. But the first those who call the Lord, the friend of the humbles after attonement with the exclusive faith in the Lord, their call is answered by the Lord who turns them to be great saint at once by bathing them in the nectar of His grace.*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* In the <span class="char-style-override-2">Gita</span>, the condition of the both types of evil doers has been described— </p>

<p class="Text">It was yesterday when Mayawati had called the Lrod with tears in her eyes. The Lord heard her call also. The tears were streaming forth from the eyes of the both—Govardhan and Mayawati. Their all the sins washed away in the flow of their tears. The both like brother and sister fondly folded their hands before the Mahatma. The Mahatma blessed Mayawati giving his basil garland and commanded her to go to the bank of Kaveri to devote herself in divine adoration. He ordered Govardhan to go to his house and said to him that he, himself, would visit his house in the morning. The veil of illusion was removed from the eyes of Govardhan and Mayawati. They were fully gratified. The grace of the saints and the Lord is infallible in bringing the highest good.</p>
<p class="Text">There was no sleep in the eyes of Govardhan’s wife. Weeping constantly, she was calling the merciful God. In the meanwhile coming there, Govardhan knocked at the door and gave a call. For a long time, Govardhan rarely came to his house and whenever he came he used  to remain intoxicated, grumbling, irritating, shrieking and staggering. The poor Brahmin lady controlled, bathed, fed, served and admonished him; but in return she got scolding, insult, reproach and bitter sharp words and sometimes beating also. The Brahmin lady endured everything, wept to think the helpless condition of her husband and being afflicted called the Lord. Today, he is quite normal. His voice speaks his natural situation. But today along with his naturality, there is somewhat unnaturality also, that is the stainless flow of nectar of the Lord’s devotion made with pure heart. The Brahmin lady became fully gratified just hearing his voice. She opened the door speedily. Govardhan entered the house with his wife. Falling down on the feet she began to weep. On the other side, there was the spontaneous overflow of tears from the eyes of the grateful Govardhan. Govardhan lifted her up and getting her seated beside him with choked voice, he narrated the whole occurences. The Brahmin lady was gratified to see the miracle of Lord’s grace and dedicated her rest life to the Lord forever. The whole night passed in the discussion of the Lord and the saint. In the morning being free from bath etc. Govardhan was thinking of the Lord’s worship when the Mahatmaji came.</p>
<p class="Text">The husband-wife fell upon his feet. The hearts of the both was full of the firmity of obligation, exhilaration and the entire dedication. Mahatmaji discoursed them both on the Lord’s devotion and initiated them with this spell of sixteen words of <span class="char-style-override-2">‘Kalisantaranopanishad’</span>—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">हरे राम हरे राम राम राम हरे हरे। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे॥  </p>
<p class="Text-Black para-style-override-2">‘Hare Ram hare Ram, Ram, Ram, Hare Hare,</p>
<p class="Text-Black">Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna, Krishna Hare Hare.’</p>
<p class="Text">—and said—‘Now there will never be your downfall. Both of you will attain the divine abode and vision of the Lord.’ Then, after partaking of alms, the Mahatma went back to his place.’</p>
<p class="Text">On the other side the both got absorbed in the Lord’s devotion. The life of the Brahmin lady was already the life of a devotee. The Brahman also became a great devotee and at last, getting the direct vision of the Lord’s manifested form, both attained the divine abode. There they got the eternal courtier state.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">The Devotee-Ramahari Bhattacharya</p>
<p class="Text">Ramhari Bhattacharya lived in a village Hanspukur near Kalana in Bengal. The means of his livelihood was the priesthood. The family consisted of his saintly wife and a son only. Ramahari’s heart was full of faith in the Lord. He had the relation of love with everyone. He had no enemy in the world. His family pulled on well with a small piece of land and from the income of gifts made by the clients willingly. Every year, he set out from the house in the month of ‘Sawan-Bhado’ (July-August) and wandering about in many villages to his clients whatever he got, he came back with it in the month of September. Ramahari Maharaj was well-contented and a Brahmana of peaceful mentality.</p>
<p class="Text">According to his usual system this year also just in the beginning of August, he set out from the house. It had started raining late this year, so these days, the sky remained overcast with dark clouds always and it rained daily. Ramahari Maharaj did not mind for gloomy and rainy days at all and remembering the Lord, he began to go from village to village as was his past practice.</p>
<p class="Text">There is the pitch road from Bardhaman to Kalna. One day, sometimes earlier than the evening Ramahari Maharaj was moving speedily on the same road. The condition of the sky became dreadful by the evening. The village was about eight miles afar. He was practically running to avoid the dreadful night of dust-wind and rains, lightening was thundering aloud, the clouds began to roar. From strong gust of the dust-wind the dreadful sound was there and it began to rain torrentialy. Ramahariji began to walk very fast with his full force. His whole body was trembling with fear and worry.</p>
<p class="Text">The night set in but there was no sign of the storm to subside. The rains swelled. The jackals were making dreadful sound hither thither. By the gust of the dust-wind the branches of big trees were falling down having been broken and the birds sitting on them were crying in the afflicted tones. It made the night more dreadful. Remembering the Lord’s name, the remover of misery, Ramahari was moving on ahead very fast without seeing anything in any side. He was worried to get any shelter in the night anyhow. In the meanwhile there was a very loud thunder clap just nearby it was struck by lightning. Ramahari trembled. Piercing the space the flames of lightning as if piercing his both eyes disappeared in the space. Ramahariji stood beneath a tree. From his mouths the remover of misery the Lord’s Name was coming out constantly. Just the next moment it came to his mind that it is not good to stand under a tree in such a stormy weather; it is not known when any branch may break. In the hope of getting some shelter he began to look all around in restlessness.</p>
<p class="Text">In the meantime the voice of a man was heard to him. Just beside the way there was a dense forest. Now, the lamp-light was also seen. Ramahari saw; two men are coming towards him slowly and slowly. He got a great consolation to see them. He called them shouting very loudly and requested them to come to him. Hearing his loud call the both came near him moving fast. They seemed to be common villagers, they were strong and vigorous physically. They had a lantern and umbrella in one hand and a long bamboo-stick in the other. Ramahari got frightened a little to see them. It is but natural to be afraid of if there is money in the pocket. The kite chases the flesh. Similarly, the thieves and the robbers also run after only money. Whatsoever may be, there was no other way. Ramahari said—‘Brothers, I will go to Govindpur; but the weather is very bad, so it is difficult to reach there in the night. It will be your great mercy to me, if you may kindly help me to reach any neighbouring village.’ Hearing the words of Ramahariji one of them said humbly—‘Panditji! My house is very close. If you take rest at my residence in the night, you will not feel any trouble. I will also feel lucky. In the morning, you may go wherever you have to go.’ Their polite words removed the fear of Ramahariji and following them he came to stand before a deserted building. One of them called—‘O Dhanna!’ When the gate was not opened, the both began to call loudly—‘Dhanna! O Dhanna!’ After awhile the gate opened and a young man of fierce appearance came out.’</p>
<p class="Text">To see the youth one of them said—‘Dhanna! Today the journey proved fruitful—We got the opportunity of guest service.’ To see towards Ramahariji with sharp eyes, Dhanna said—‘Then should I manage for the meal?’ Seeing their manners, Ramahariji apprehended that there is some wrong. His heart began to throb and he began to remember Shyamasunder, the protector from misery in his mind. But hiding his inner feelings, he said only this—‘I will eat nothing today; and if the rain stopped, I will depart even in the night.’ Dhanna said nothing to hear his words and took him inside pulling him. Both the men also followed and went inside.</p>
<p class="Text">Ramahariji saw that there was all around like forest, there was only a single house in the side. Dhanna took away Ramahariji in a room in the middle of the house and asked him to take rest on the wooden bedstead and went away from there. Ramahariji was trembling badly sitting on the bedstead. Oh! What an inauspicious moment was when I set out of the house and why did I ask for help from them in the forest? Today, my life will not be safe in the hands of these robbers.</p>
<p class="Text">The sound of talk was heard from adjoining room. There was a thin wall in the middle, so, all conversation was audible to him. With their voice he came to recognise that those talking there, two of them were the same who had met him in the forest and the third one was Dhanna. In the course of conversation, he came to know that names of the two were Haran and Tinkauri and Dhanna was the son of Haran. Haran said—‘Just see Tinkauri! It seems that he is a Brahman, there is a sacred thread in his neck. There will be sin of killing a Brahman.’ Tinkauri said—‘Well! You are a great coward. Till now the sin of how many Brahmanas killing would have accrued to me? One more will be added. It seems that he has sufficient money.’ Dhanna interrupted—‘All of you need not worry. Only in one strike the work will be over. Well enough! Let him be asleep.’ Haran said—‘Keep quiet! Why do you talk loudly, if he hears, he will slip somewhere.’ Dhanna said—‘Where will he runaway? Is it easy to escape away from my clutches?’ Ramahari fell into frightful suspense. It came to his mind that he should flee away; but Dhanna’s words came to his mind. He thought that he would be watching all around and again, where he would go to run away in this forest. These wickeds will kill me finding out me at once.</p>
<p class="Text">Outside it was still raining heavily. The shower of rain was a bit slow, but yet other things were the same. From the middle of the house some portion of the dark sky was visible. Every moment there was lightning in the sky and side by the fierce sound of the thunder clap was heard from distance—as if it were conveying the message of death to Ramahari. There was a tree of Kadamb just near. In its mid after some intervals, the gust of cool breeze with the sweet fragrance of the blooming branches used to come. The memory of the Kadamb tree existing by the side of the temple of Shyamsunder flashed on the mind of Ramahariji. Oh! There would be blossoming thousands of flowers in that Kadamb tree also and the sweet air of rain would be scattering its sweet fragrance all around likewise. My saintly wife, would be dreaming of my return clinging the child to her bosom and my soul Shyamsunder! The Lord of my high ambitions and the dire spiritual discipline Shyamsunder! Oh! If I was killed today in this isolated forest at the hands of the robbers, my Shyamsunder! Then who will worship You? I don’t know whether the Brahman whom I had given the responsibility of your worship during my absence he is performing worship properly or not. O Shyamsunder! You are not the idol of stone merely, in your swarthy body like blue lotus there remains always present the boundless divine compassionate power which is always doing the well being of the afflicted beings. Speak, speak, my Shyamsunder! Will this perishable body of this poor Brahman seeking shelter in You be the food of the jackal’s and dogs in this unknown forest? The tears streamed forth from the eyes of Ramahari. Like a lunatic he began to cry pathetically calling ‘Shyamsunder! Shyamsunder!!’</p>
<p class="Text">When the Brahmana Ramahari was weeping with the afflicted pathetic temperament calling ‘Shyamsunder! Shyamsunder!!’ exactly at the same time in the next room, Dhanna was sharpening the small sword. Tinkauri and Haran were busy in conversation. They thought that the Brahman would be sleeping or taking rest in the adjoining room. Their eyes were fixed at the Brahman, but due to tiredness, he was yawning  at intervals. Ultimately they decided that this work is not to be done with the hands of Dhanna. Haran said—‘Then, I will finish this work. Let me see whether the Brahman has gone to sleep or not. No sound is heard.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having said this Haran saw going there. At that time Ramahari crouching himself under the cover of the bedsheet in the restless mood with the fear of his life. In his mind the pathetic prayer of Shyamsunder was continuing. To see him Harun said slowly—‘Tinkauri! He is in deep sleep, Then, why to delay.’ Tinkauri said—‘Probably he might be awaken, wait a little more.’</p>
<p class="Text">Ramahariji was going to be horror-stricken. He was thinking—‘Now there is no way to escape from death. Lord what happened this?’</p>
<p class="Text">Abruptly the Brahman felt the boundless strength. The Kadamb tree was just near the kitchen in the house. Due to rain it was loaded with the leaves. The tree was dense and large. There was sufficient place to hide behind the leaves. Leaving the sheet of cloth, Ramahari stood up slowly and slowly and at once, climbing on the tree, he hid himself.</p>
<p class="Text">On the other side while drinking wine, Harun said in the intoxication—‘Dhanna! Today you will have not to use the sword. I will perform this ‘Brahmayagya’. It seems that he is in the sound sleep.’ Despite being irritated to himself, Dhanna said nothing. Taking the sword from Dhanna’s hands, Harun checked the edge of the sword. Then, all the three began to drink wine with glass after glass. The intoxication began to overpower them. Dhanna drank excessively. He felt sleepy. Swinging to and fro he came out and lay down on the same bedstead where Ramahariji had slept and wrapped his body with the same sheet of cloth. In the intoxication, he was quite unaware of his action, he was unconscious. Tinkauri and Harun taking the taste of the flour of the parched grain and chillies in their mouth, again they started drinking. Now, they were in full intoxication. Swinging to and fro, taking the sharpened sword Harun reached the adjoining room. Ramahariji was watching with his terrified amazed eyes in the faded light of the lantern, placed in a room sitting on the Kadamb tree and was calling Shyamsunder in his mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Haran and Tinkauri felt that the Brahmana was sleeping. They were over-intoxicated. Haran used the sword with full force, the very moment, Dhanna’s head being separated from the body fell down on the ground.</p>
<p class="Text">The heart trembles just to recall the scene of that time. Haran and Tinkauri saw with fearful eyes—‘O this is the head of Dhanna! Enough! The very moment their intoxication vanished and throwing away the sword and clinging his dear son Dhanna’s head  to his bosom Haran began to wail like a mad. Tinkauri searched the Brahmana everywhere but he could not find him. Being frightened of his life in the restless condition, Ramahariji began to remember Shyamsunder. The then different sentiments of Ramahariji about his rememberance cannot be presumed unless being in same condition. Carrying the dead body of Dhanna when they had gone away in the forest, coming out of the deserted house, the Brahman could gather his courage. Till then, rains had also thinned and the night was also nearby over. The Brahman alighted from the tree silently and watching carefully all around set out. By divine grace, he got the right way. Haran and Tinkauri had gone to the opposit side. So, no misery fell upon him.</p>
<p class="Text">Going to a distance slowly and slowly, then, Ramahariji ran and reached the pitch road. At that time, he got the company of some others also. Recounting Shyamsunder’s virtues Ramahari reached his home directly. Well! Since then his whole life was devoted in divine adoration.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">The Devotee-Robber</p>
<p class="Text">This occurence is of olden days. Divine discourses were organised in a well pretty way in the house of a rich householder. It was the night of moonlit fortnight of the month Vaishakh. All the arrangements had been made for the comforts of the visiting guests. All the directions were scented by the fragrance of jasmine, Bela and maulisiri etc., flowers. For the offering to God, mango, grapes, pomegranates, apples and other fruits were being clipped. When all the objects of adoration were prepared, the worship of the Lord was performed duly by the virtue of sight of the charming idol of the Lord, hearing of the Lord’s narratives, smelling of the scented flowers and the peaceful atmosphere all the gentlemen, present there began to feel supernatural joy. All of them became so much busy and absorbed in this holy festival that they did not mark the passage of time.</p>
<p class="Text">Panditji relating the fables, was a learned scholar and side by side, he was a good singer also. In the course of relating the fable, time to time, he used to sing also the emotional stanzas relating to the Lord in melodious voice. First, he narrated the narrative of the Lord’s birth in brief on the basis of <span class="char-style-override-2">Shrimad Bhagavata</span>, then, while describing the festivities in the house of Nanda, he recited a sweet stanza in the ‘Bilawal melody’—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">आनँद आज नंदके द्वार। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">दास अनन्य भजन रस कारण </p>
<p class="SHLOK">प्रगटे लाल मनोहर ग्वार॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">चंदन सकल धेनु तन मंडित </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कुसुम दाम सोभित आगार। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">पूरन कुंभ बने तोरन पर </p>
<p class="SHLOK">बीच रुचिर पीपरकी डार॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">जुवति जूथ मिलि गोप बिराजत </p>
<p class="SHLOK">बाजत प्रनव मृदंग सितार। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">जय (श्रीहित) हरिवंश अजिर बर बीथिन </p>
<p class="SHLOK">दधि मधु दुग्ध हरदके खार॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘Today, Nanda’s house is overwhelmed with the immense joy. The whole atmosphere of Nand’s courtyard is full of happiness. It is on account of the exclusive devotional song that the charming ‘Gwara’ (Lord Krishna) is born here today. All the cows are embellished with sandal and the whole house is decorated with flowers. The fully filled pitchers are established on the archway and in the middle it is decorated with the beautiful branches of the peepal tree. The male and female cowherd youth are present in their different groups. The sound of drum like instrument and indian stringed musical instrument (Sitar) is resounding everywhere being played by them. Haribansaji says the whole atmosphere is joyous and enjoying even in holy streets, there is the splash of honey, milk, curd and Harad everywhere.’</p>
<p class="Text">The reference of the fable continued further. The audience became carefree and were obessed in the divine bliss forgetting their own being and the worry of their domestic duty. Many of them got horripiliated. Tears flowed from the eyes of many. All were completely absorbed.</p>
<p class="Text">At the same time, getting an opportunity, a robber entered the house of that rich man and began to search for the riches and jewels silently. But such was the divine play that he could get nothing in spite of his best efforts. When he was searching for here and there to get something in his hands, the same moment his mind was diverted towards the mythological fable. The narrator of the fable, Panditji Maharaj was narrating in the loud tone—‘The morning set in. The Eastern direction of the sky got coloured with the charming radiance and redness of the rising sun. At that time the picturesque of Braj was looking supernatural. All the objects there, were brightenning. The birds were chirping loudly more and more so because as if Shri Krishna should come soon and quench the thirst of their eyes. The cows and calves were looking towards the palace of Nandababa with unsatiated sight raising their heads again and again that their dear Shri Krishna would be coming to please them. At the same time the most favourite friends of Shri Krishna, Shridama, Sudama, Vasudama etc., the cowherds coming there called Shri Krishna and Balaram with great love—‘Our dear Kanhaiya! Do come. Are you sleeping till now? Just see! The cows are lowing without seeing you. We have been waiting for you since long standing here. Let us move to the forest to tend the cows. O Dau Dada! Why are you delaying so much? Thus, the call of the cowherds and marking the haste Nandarani began to wake up her dear sons with sweet voice—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तुम जागौ मेरे लाड़िले गोकुल सुखदाई। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कहति जननि आनंद सौं उठो कुँवर कन्हाई॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तुमको माखन-दूध दधि मिश्री हौं ल्याई। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">उठि कै भोजन कीजियै पकवान मिठाई॥</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सखा द्वार परभात सौं सब टेर लगाई। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">बनको चलिए साँवरे दयो तरनि दिखाई॥ </p>
<p class="Text">‘Wake up my fondled son, pleasant to Gokula. The mother Yashoda says with delightfulness—O Kunwar Kanhaiya! Get up. I have brought the butter, milk, curd, sugar candy for You. Get up and eat the fried delicacy and sweets. At the gate, Your friends have been calling You since long in the morning to accompany them to the forest.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then, the mother decorated him well after feeding the breakfast of butter-sweet candy and different viands with great love and fond. She got her son wear the ornaments of lacs and crores of rupees, diamonds, jewels and golden ornaments set with pearls. In the crown, in the armlet, in the necklace the diamonds that were glittering in the light of which even the brightness of the morning was dim. Thus, having decorated well Nandarani smell their head of her fondled sons and bade them farewell with great love to tend the grazing cows. The robber heard these words and the rest he had not heard. Now, he began to think—‘O! It is a very good chance, I remain wandering about for the triffling objects. This is the opportunity of taking the boundless wealth. They are merely two children. The moment, I give two slaps on their cheeks they will put off their all the ornaments and handover them to me. Thinking so, the robber came out of the house and began to wait for the end of the discourse.</p>
<p class="Text">The robber’s joys had no bound. The fable narrator Panditji what he had said about the ornaments embellished on this charming body of Shri Krishna and Balaramji, he used to laugh hartily to remember that—‘O! How glittering the ornaments would be! Just to bring by snatching them. I will become very rich. Then what to ask for my happiness. Only by the thought of those ornaments  illumined his heart. With the ray of light along with the ornaments there used to be the contemplation of the Lord’s appearance also. Having forgotten his poverty, he began to sink into the ocean of joys. The mythological fable ended late in the night. The sky resounded with the loudation of cheers and Lord’s Name. The devotee householder began to request the audience to partake of the remainings of the offerings of Thakurji with great meekness. The remainings of the oblation began to be distributed. The bliss streamed forth. Wherever the eyes go, the people are oblivious of themselves to get the remainings of the divine offerings. Here, this was the scene, but the robber was unmindful of all these. His eyes were fixed on the activities of the narrator. After sometime taking the remainings of the divine offerings the narrator moved towards his abode. The robber also followed him.</p>
<p class="Text">When Panditji reached the open field, the robber said calling him in the harsh tone—‘O Panditji! Halt!’ Panditji had the gifted money also, being frightened, he began to move fast. Running after him the robber said—‘Panditji! Halt.’ You cannot escape yourself by running away in this way.’ Panditji saw that there was no way to escape. Being helpless, he stopped. Reaching him, the robber said—‘Just see Panditji! Where is the house of that Krishna and Balram about whose ornaments of lacs and crores you were narrating? Where do they go to graze cows? Tell everything exactly; If you tried to beat about the bush the least, see, what a fat bamboo stick is in my hand!, it will break your head into pieces.’ Panditji saw that his long and broad body like monster was very strong. There is a fat bamboo stick in his hands, the cruelty is reflecting in his eyes. He thought—‘It seems certainly that he is a robber.’ Then, recollecting his courage, he said—‘What is your work with him?’ The robber said emphatically—‘There is need.’ Panditji said—‘Is there any hurdle to disclose your need?’ The robber said—‘Panditji! I am a dacoit. I want to rob his ornaments. If I could be successful in getting the ornaments, I will give something to you also. Just see, don’t evade. Tell me exactly.’ Panditji came to understand that he was absolutely a great fool. Now, he said with some courage—‘Then, what is the fear? I will tell you everything in detail. But here, on the way, I have no book. It is there at my quarter. Follow me to my residence. I will tell you everything correctly consulting the book.’ The robber began to accompany him.</p>
<p class="Text">Reaching his residence, Panditji said nothing to anyone. He took out the book and began to relate the charming appearance of the Lord Shri Krishna and Balaram. He said—‘In the lotus feet of the both there are beautiful anklets of gold which could charm anyone’s mind with its tinkling sound. Shri Krishna of dark colour, assumes the cloth of yellow colour and Balarama of fair colour assumes the cloth of blue colour. The waist of the both is embellished with the valuable girdle of gold set with pearls. There is necklace of gold and diamond in their necks. On the bosom ‘Kaustubhamani’ (a kind of gem) shimmers. There is no other gem in the world parallel to this. In wrist there is the bracelet of gold set with gems; in ears, there are earrings of gems, on the head, there is very charming tuft of hair. His hair are black and curly, there is the mark of ‘Kasturi’ on the forehead, mild smile on the lips, the eyes are as if raining the immense joy and love. Shri Krishna always remains placing the golden flute on his lips holding it in his lotus hands. Before the lustre of physical parts the radiance of crores of suns is meaningless. The garland of the fragrant flowers of different colours, His pointed nose like that of parrot, the row of white teeth is like the Jasmine flower. His appearance is very charming and attractive. O! When he stands having the position with three bends in the body; the eyes are not sated even after staring at Him constantly. When Bankevihari Shri Krishna plays on his flute with the sweet melody of ‘Radhe-Radhe’, even the great savants run having got rid of their trance to hear it. On the bank of Yamuna river in Vrindavan beneath the Kadamb tree generally His sight can be seen. Shri Krishna and Balaram carrying the plough. They are wearing the garland of sylvan flowers</p>
<p class="Text">The robber said—‘Well Panditji! What would be the price of their all the ornaments?’ Panditji said—‘Oh! It cannot be estimated. Even more than crores and crores.’ The robber—‘Does he possers even more than the ornaments you have named?’ Panditji—‘Why not? The entire property of the whole earth one side and the ‘Kaustubhamani’ only on the other side. Yet there is no comparison at all.’ Being thrilled with joy the robber said—‘Alright! Well! and say more, how is that?’ Panditji said—‘The place where it exits, is illumined like the sun. The darkness cannot exist there. There is no such gem on the earth.’ The robber said—‘Then its value would be very high. What did you say? Please, explain it to me once very well. Yes, I forgot one thing at all. To which direction should I proceed?’ Panditji explained the whole matter once more. The robber said—‘I will give you a part thereof coming to you soon. Is the distance from here not very far? Will I reach there in one night. Why? Well! Alright! Tell me one thing more. Does He go daily to tend the cows?’ Panditji said—‘Yes, Why not?’ Robber—‘When does He come?’ Panditji—‘Exactly in the morning. Then, it remaining a bit darkness also.’ Robber—‘Well! I understood everything. Yes, then, now to which direction should I go?’ Panditji—‘Go straight towards North.’ Having reverentially saluted, the robber set out.</p>
<p class="Text">Panditji laughed in his own mind. Just see! What a senseless he is! After a while he got worried, this blunt fool will make efforts for a few days to search out. Then, coming back he may start torturing me, then? But not so, he is of great faith. If he comes back, I will guide him one another way. He will roam about two to four days, till then, having finished the fable, I will depart from here. There is no other way to get rid of him. Panditji became a little carefree.</p>
<p class="Text">The robber went to his house. His hunger, thirst and sleep, everything vanished. He used to think of the ornaments day and night. Laden with the glittering ornaments both the children charming to the eyes and mind remained present always before his eyes. Even for a moment, his mind did not divert anywhere. If he forgot ever, the property in hand would be lost. The divine parts of the Lord’s body embellished with the glittering of the decorated ornaments used to shimmer before his eyes always. In the same state of mind, the night passed. He remained quite unaware of it. The sun rose, yet there was only one worry in his mind, only single thought. The people of the world were engaged in their own works. Someone was enjoying recreation, someone was passing the time in laziness, the air was on its own movement, the river was in its usual flow, the birds were chirpling and the robber was busy in his mind to put off the ornaments from the illuminating dark and fair bodies of the adolescents. Like a moment in the winking of an eye the whole day passed but in the mind of the robber, there was only one man. If there is devotion to any purpose it should be so! If there is madness it should be so!! The darkness set in, taking the bamboo stick the robber set out for the North. That North was also of his craze, he might be going towards South probably in the eyes of others.’ He was not aware of this also. Whether his feet were on ground or on thorns, he didn’t know. It is quite true—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">जाहि लगन लगी घनस्यामकी! </p>
<p class="SHLOK">धरत कहूँ पग परत कितैहूँ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">भूल जाय सुधि धामकी॥ </p>

<p class="Text">‘He who has craze of the Lord Ghanashyam, becomes mad. He steps somewhere else but his feet fall anywhere else and he forgets about abode. After seeing the charm of the appearance, there remains nothing for him. He is oblivious of time, night, day and watches of time Wherever he raises his face he runs towards and has no idea of shade and sunshine. He does not care for the praise or condemnation he does not recall his family and village. He wanders about in madness of Lord. He becomes meaningless for others.’</p>
<p class="Text">While going away on his mission the robber’s eyes opened at a place. He saw that there was a very beautiful garden full of greenary. A river was also flowing there smoothly. He thought, he determined—‘This is the place! This is the place! But where is the Kadamb tree’s?’ The robber began to try to recognise ‘the Kadamb tree’ going to each and every tree. It is not known how many trees he touched and how many leaves he saw. Ultimately, a tree of Kadamb fell before his sight. Now, he crossed the limit of his joy. He took the breath of satisfaction and cast his look all around. A small hill, dense forest and the field to tend the cows also became visible to him. The green grass had mixed with the natural darkness of the night. Yet, before his inner eyes a glimpse of cows grazing and the tenders ultimately splashed. Now, there was only one thought in the mind of the robber, when may the morning set in and when the purpose is fulfilled. He watched every moment carefully and thought how long it was for the morning to set in. He saw that the time of his ambition to be fulfilled was coming close. Casting his sharp eye-sight on each and every branch of the Kadamb tree and climbing on it he was trying for the safe place so that he might jump down at once just when they reached there and could be able to rob their ornaments. He began to confirm it in his mind how he would catch them and snatch their ornaments. As the night passed so was the intensity of his worry, restlessness, temptation, insistence and eagerness increased.</p>
<p class="Text">Sometimes, it seemed to him as if the Kaustubhmani had flashed before his eyes. He thought—‘Kaustubhamani’ removes the darkness. If these children happened to see him in the light of the gem, then, all his efforts would prove vain. They would try to run away to see me. Well! Then, I should climb on the topmost branch of the Kadamb tree and wait for their arrival hiding myself behind the leaves. He climbed on the tree. After very short time it came to his mind—‘No, No; they will run away by time I come down. It is not proper to stay here. He came down. He began to think—‘Let me stand silently in the cluster of the trees and just on their arrival I should pounce on them.’ Going there he hid himself behind the trees while standing the storm of thoughts began to obsess his mind—‘No, No, probably, they might see me here and then my all the planning will be shattered. Well, let me hide myself in the front pit. It is quite right, He will play on His flute just after reaching here. I will waste no time to catch Him just hearing the tune of His flute.’ After such consideration the robber went and hid himself in the pit. Only after a moment, another idea crossed his mind—‘It may be possible that the sound of the flute might not be heard to me. So, it is better to stay outside.’ Now, coming out he began to assess giving his ears to the tune of the flute again and again. When he got no trace of any sound, he again climbed on the Kadamb tree and began to mark if there was brightness anywhere, whether the melody of the flute was heard from anywhere or not. He consoled to his mind—‘It is too late yet in the dawn. Just when I hear the tune of the flute, I will pounce upon.’ Thus, thinking so the robber began to wait for the morning with great curiosity.</p>
<p class="Text">In no time someone coloured the face of the East direction with the mixture of turmeric and lime (Roli). The restlessness of the robber increased more and he came to the ground jumping from the tree, but he again  climbed up the tree due to not hearing the sound of the flute. There also, no such sound was heard. His heart was as if breaking every moment. Just now, his heart would rejoice but what is this, whether his hope was accomplished! Far away, the melodious sound of the flute is heard sitting on the tree. He jumped over from the tree. Yes, but the sign of disbelief developed in his mind whether it was his misconception. At once, he climbed upon the topmost branch of the tree. Yes, yes, right it is, it is the flute. Well, this melody is coming close. The robber lost his senses in the emotion of joy and fell down on the ground being fainted. In a few moment, he came to his sense, he opened his eyes; he stood up. He saw that a divine trinquilling light was illuminating all around in the close forest. In that cool light two most charming lads are scattering the supernatural splendour of their physical parts. The cows and the cowherds have gone farther onward.</p>
<p class="Text">The robber saw them, still he had hardly called them than his mind was charmed—‘How splendid are their faces! Their eyes are raining nectar and every part of their body is embellished with ornaments. Oh! How did the parents send such small children to tend the cows? Oh! It is I who am so much moved with—I desire to go on seeing them. Where is the question to put off their ornaments, they need to be decorated more. No, I will not rob their ornaments. No, No, if I don’t rob their ornaments, then why did I come? Right, I will rob their ornaments. But I will not kill them. O my God! This work cannot be fulfilled by me. But how this the sense of attachment in me? I am a robber, robber! I and mercy! How can the both run side by side! Enough! I just snatch their ornaments.’ Saying so he rushed towards Shri Krishna and Balaram. Reaching before Shri Krishna and Balaram, he lost his senses once again to see the appearance of Shri Krishna and Balram. His legs began to stumble and he fell down. Again he rose, remained staring without winking of the eyes, his eyes came to be filled with tears. Then, again what he thought, he went before them with the bamboo stick in his hands and said—‘Stand up. Put off your all the ornaments and give me.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—‘Why should we give you our ornaments?’</p>
<p class="Text">Robber—‘Will you not handover? See towards my bamboo-stick.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—‘What will your bamboo stick do?’</p>
<p class="Text">Robber—‘Well, what will it do? In case, you don’t give, I will break your head and what more will be?’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—‘No, we will not part with ornaments.’</p>
<p class="Text">Robber—‘I will just twist Your ears and having robbed Your all ornaments, I will throw You into the river.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—(Loudly) ‘Ah gosh!, O gosh! O gosh!!’</p>
<p class="Text">The robber tried to press his mouth pounching on Shri Krishna abruptly with his hands, but just on touching it was so as if the electric current ran in his whole body. Being fainted, he fell down on the ground with a thud. After a few moments, when he came to his senses, he said to Krishna—‘O! Who are You both? As, I look at you, you are appearing to to me more and more handsome, more sweet and more charming, why it is so? The lids of my eyes stopped winking. Oh! Oh! Why do I feel weeping? Why are the hair of my body standing on end? Well! I here came to know that both of You are gods and not human beings.</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—(smiling) ‘No, we are human beings. We are cowherds. We are the sons of the king of Braj, Nandababa.’</p>
<p class="Text">Robber—‘O! What a smile! Go, graze cows. Now, I don’t want Your ornaments. My hope disappeared, my wish—sigh all vanished away. Yes, I want that I should get You both put on more ornaments to your charming body with my own hands. Go away, Go, yes, at least put Your both the reddish lotus feet on my head. Yes, yes, please, stretch Your hands towards me, so that I may satifsy my innerself by kissing Your smooth palms. Oh! How cool, how sweet is Your touch! Blessed, blessed I am. By Your sweet touch the blaze of my heart is getting pacified. The hope and ambition all disappeared. Go, yes, yes, now go. My hunger and thirst vanished. Now, I don’t want to go anywhere. I will stay here. Will both of You come daily by this way, isn’t it? Once, daily. Only for a moment, yes, daily, mind it that You will oblige me with Your sight daily for a moment. Mind it, never forget. Keep it in Your mind to come daily otherwise my life will end writhing in agony.</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—‘Is it so that you will not thrash us again? Isn’t it that you will not rob our ornaments? Yes, now promise so, only then, we can come daily.’</p>
<p class="Text">Robber—‘I promise, hundred times I promise! O! Oath in the name of God! I will never thrash both of You. Is there anyone in the world to harming You? The entire might disappears just to see You. The mind itself goes out of hold. Then, who to beat You and how to beat You? Well! Now, go, both of you.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—‘If we handover the ornaments to you, will you take it?’</p>
<p class="Text">Robber—‘Ornament! Ornament!! What is the use of ornaments now? Now, there is no desire to take anything?’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—‘Why not, take it. Now, we are giving it.’</p>
<p class="Text">Robber—‘Are you giving? You are giving? Then, I am bound to accept, but if Your parents are angry and beat You, then?’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—‘No, No, We are princes. We have a lot of ornaments like this. If you want we may give you other more ornaments.’</p>
<p class="Text">Robber—‘Oh! What will I do with the ornaments? Yes, yes’ but Your words cannot be disregarded also? Have You got other more ornaments? Tell me the truth.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—‘If we don’t have more how could we give to you without possessing more? Take them away.’</p>
<p class="Text">Lord Shri Krishna began to give the ornaments having put them off from His body.</p>
<p class="Text">The robber said—‘See brother! If You really want to give, take my this wrapper and pack in it with Your own hands. But see Lala! If You are giving it unwillingly only to fulfil my desire, then, I don’t want. My desire is at present only to see Your charming face daily once and to get my head touched with Your lotus feet daily once.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna—‘No, No, where is the question of unwillingness? You do, come again, I will give You more ornaments the next time.’ Shri Krishna packed his ornaments in his wrapper. Taking the small packet of ornaments in his hands, the robber said—‘Why brother! If I come again will You give me more ornaments, isn’t it? Whether You give me ornaments or not but You must bless me with your vision.’ Shri Krishna said—‘Certainly, the ornament and sight both.’ The robber set out for his house with the ornaments.</p>
<p class="Text">Plunging in the ocean of bliss the robber returned home. The next night, going to the Panditji’s house, he narrated the entire occurences to him and put the packing of the ornaments before him. He said—‘See, see; Panditji! How much ornaments I have brought. You may take so much ornaments as much you desire. Panditji! He has promised to give me more ornaments again.’ Panditji was taken aback to hear and see this. He said with great astonishment—‘Did You bring the ornaments from Him whose fables I had narrated?’ The robber said—‘Why not? Just see this flute of gold! This crest jewel of the crown!! Panditji was stunend. He thought over much, pondered over, but he could not reach any conclusion. He, who is eternal and beginningless the Purushottama, the Supreme Self. This robber got the sight of that Lord whose sight is unobtainable to even the big ascetics who remain absorbed in whose meditation for hundreds and hundreds of years having given up the entire world like straw, having ignored hunger—thirst and sleep but remain deprived of His sight! He has brought His ornaments!! Hello, what is it? Impossible. It can never be possible. But what is this? This crown jewel, this flute, these ornaments, all are supernatural. Wherefrom and how did he get all this? My mind is perplexed. Remaining silent for a moment Panditji said—‘Why brother! Can you help me to see His sight?’ Robber—‘Why not, do accompany me tomorrow.’ With full disbelief, Panditji set out with the robber only to find out the occurence and the next day, reached the appointed place. Panditji saw—‘There is a beautiful garden. A small river is flowing, a big field and there is a Kadamb tree also. That is not Braj, not Yamuna; but it is the semblance. The night passed; before the dawn the robber said—‘Mind Panditji! You are a newcomer. Hide yourself behind any tree. If He does not come to see you, then? Now, there is no delay in the day break He will come just now.’ The robber was just talking to Panditji that the sweet charming tune of the flute reached his ears. He came to speak—‘Hear, Hear, Panditji! He is playing on the flute. How pleasant! How charming! Are you hearing it or not?’ Panditji—‘Where it is sounding, I am hearing nothing? Have you gone mad?’</p>
<p class="Text">Robber—‘Panditji! I am not mad, wait a little, you will see Him just. Stay, just I see climbing upon the tree, how afar He is!’</p>
<p class="Text">Having climbed on the tree the robber saw and said—‘Panditji! Panditji!! Now, He is not far away.’ Having come down from the tree, he saw that at a little distance the unique radiance was spreading. In joy, he called—‘Panditji! Here He is, He is. The divine light of His body is brightening the whole forest. Panditji—‘I don’t see anything.’ Robber—‘Why is it so, Panditji! He is so close, such a bright illumination, and yet you fail to see. Hello, You are able to see the forest, river, brook everything but you don’t see Him.’ Panditji—‘Yes, brother! I dont’ see them. Just see, if really, He is, then you ask Him—‘Whatever You want to give, give all on the hands of this Brahman.’ The robber accepted.</p>
<p class="Text">Till then, the Lord Shri Krishna and Balakaramji had already stood near the robber coming there. The robber said—‘Come on, come on! I have already come. I am waiting for You.’ Shri Krishna! I will not take ornaments. I have brought to return these ornaments also what you had given to me, now, take back all. But brother! This Panditji is not believing in my words—Only for his faith I have brought him with me. I hear the sound of Your flute-melody. I perceive the forest glittering with splendour of Your body, I converse with You. But this Panditji is not hearing and perceiving all this. If You are not visible to him, he will not believe in my words.’ Shri Krishna—‘O brother! He is not worthy of My sight yet. He may be old learned or Pandit but what does it mean?’ Robber—‘No, brother! I sacrifice myself on You. Whatever You say, I will do for him. But bless him with Your charming appearance only once.’ Smiling Shri Krishna said—‘Well! You touch Me and Panditji both at the same time.’ Just when the robber did so, Panditji got the divine sight. He glanced the sight of ‘Murali Manohar Pitambaradhari Shyamsunder’s (Lord Krishna in yellow garment with flute on His lips, unique and charming in appearance) supernatural unique picturescue. Then, the both being fully gratified, fell down on His feet.</p>
<p class="Text">The frolicsome plays of the Lord Krishna, the Kalpataru (the tree fulfilling all desires) of His devotees, is such as, He is somewhere in the manifested form and somewhere He is playing the game of hide and seek. Whosoever desired to see Him with the eyes of faith He was visible to him exactly in the same form, he desired. He has no distinction between the robber and Pandit. Only what is needed is faith, love and craze. Can we also be able to see the Lord like the same robber? No, no, you will be able to have His vision like the foremost devotee robber with the eyes of faith? Certainly.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">The Devotee-Navina Chandra</p>
<p class="Text">There lived a Brahman in a village, named Balai near Jagdishpur. The Brahman was of a great moral conduct, God-devotee and contented. His name was Sharad Thakur. His wife Brahmini was also modest and chaste. He was a priest for several families. Very rich persons were his disciples. Those days, as the Brahmana priests used to be of moral conduct and learned, so were his clients also reverent and liberals. Sharad Thakur used to get sufficient riches from his clients without asking for. The expendicture was scanty, so his prosperity was enhancing day by day. Sharad Thakur had only one son, Navinchandra. Navinachandra was simple-hearted, but due to being the only son of his parents, he was not under control. There was the abundance of riches in the house already. To see the prosperity and comforts of Navin and to take advantage of that like the buzzing bees of execration, the group of vagabond boys of bad conduct came together around him. The company has an emphatic impact. Navin also could not escape himself from the influence of bad company. The mother and father also could not say anything due to fondness.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यौवनं धनसम्पत्तिः प्रभुत्वमविवेकता। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">एकैकमप्यनर्थाय किमु यत्र चतुष्टयम्॥ </p>
<p class="Text">‘Even a single one of the youth, riches, the lordship in the house and foolishness is dangerous and sufficient for causing harm and where there are all the four combined, what to say of their consequences?’ Navinchandra, too, set out on the disastrous way according to it. Sometimes passed in this way but it came to the clime of impropriety and vices, Sharad Thakur had an inkling of something wrong. He was badly shocked by the evil doings of the son and repented for his carelessness. He began to think—‘If I had been careful since the beginning, Navina would not have reached this deplorable condition. But now, what to do? Navina would be changed only on my good advice, there is no possibility at all.’ Sharad Thakur got worried. He put the whole situation before his wife. The poor lady also began to worry. But there was no way visible. The both began to call God being pathetic.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is affectionate to His devotees, He heard the call of the devotee Sharad Thakur. Just after some days, a great person named Shivendra Swami visited the village Balai while wandering about and stayed there under a tree on the bank of the river during the rainy season of four months (Chaturmas).</p>
<p class="Text">He was an exalted soul. The men and women of the village began to visit him for his sight. He used to meditate remaining silent throughout the days. He broke his silence only for one hour. The repute and fame of the Mahatmaji spread far and wide from village to village. From the neighbouring villages also the visitors began to come for his view. Sharad Thakur also visited. One day, Sharad began to weep to narrate the wayward state of Navina to Mahatmaji.</p>
<p class="Text">Mahatmaji said—‘Don’t be worried. His latencies are very good, he will be a great devotee. Bring him once before me.’ Sharad got a very encouraging assurance.</p>
<p class="Text">Persuading Navin, Sharad Thakur brought him to the Mahatmaji. Mahatmaji caressed his hands on the back and head of Navina and said—‘Son! Will you follow my words? Isn’t it?’ Navina said like spell-bound—‘Yes, lord! I will certainly follow your words.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Then, come here daily.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Since today I will come Lord!’</p>
<p class="Text">‘You will have to stay here.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘I will stay Maharaj!’</p>
<p class="Text">‘But he who lives with me, must act upon my conditions.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘I will do accordingly Maharaj! Tell me what are your conditions?’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Never take wine, never tell a lie, get up before sun-rise, perform morning and evening prayers, offer oblation to the fire, worship the mother ‘Katyayini’, mutter daily systematically Her spell <span class="char-style-override-1">‘ह्रीं श्रीं कात्यायन्यै स्वाहा’ </span>eat the remaining of the oblation—enough; these eight are my conditions.’ ‘As you command. Should I bring the requisites of ‘Agnihotra’ (oblation to fire)?’ ‘I will manage to bring all the requisites.’ Having uttered so, to Navina, Mahatmaji pointed towards Sharad Thakur to arrange all the requisites. At the very moment all the requisites were brought. Navina began to stay there. From the very moment, he was transformed. The regular muttering and adoration of the goddess ‘Katyayini’, systematic and restrained life and the association of enlightened persons. By the Lord’s great grace, all the ingrediants were easily made available. On a very short time his face began to shine like the moon of the moon lit fortnight.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, Navin said—‘Lord! If you have graced me with your so much mercy, then bless me with one more. Oblige me to initiate me to renunciation. Mahatmaji said—‘Son! Everything happens according to the will of Jagdamba. If she wills, she will adopt you as Her devotee transforming you as the relinquisher of all the sensuous enjoyments. You, son! Dedicate yourself completely to Her. Mind it—You are not fully aware. By the association of virtuous persons here, your all the vices, your tendencies for enjoyments have been repressed, have decayed also but they are not completely vanished. By the grace of the mother Jagdamba when the fire of true renunciation inflames, automatically, the rubbish of sensuous enjoyments will burn to ashes. Son! Two swords cannot remain in one sheath. Similarly, renunciation is not possible so long as there is the lurking desire of enjoyments it does not completely vanish. What is the value of the mimicry of renunciation? Resultant of the sorrows from the sensuous enjoyments sometimes a spirit of detachment occurs that is not the real detachment. In intense emotion to abandon the house is not the real renunciation. The desire of wealth, wife, son, name-fame etc., remains hidden in the mind and sometimes bringing the temptation of big allurements tries to deviate the spiritual aspirant. It is the truth that the sensuous enjoyments are the root cause of all sorrows in every condition. But without the grace of the mother Jagdamba it is hard nut to crack to get rid of the worldly lewdness. Propitiate the mother, do whatever the mother commands with pleasure. The mother is already pleased. The son may be wicked of any category but the mother’s affectionate heart never goes to dry. The lap of mother is always ready for her son. Well! When you want to occupy the lap of mother—only in the lap of mother alone, only then, the Mother having come before you apparently, will lift you in Her lap. She will clasp you to Her bosom. Son! Keep patience, knowing the glory of the Mother go on calling mother, mother. Your highest good is sure. There is no need of other one between the mother and the son; she is your mother; you are her son!’</p>
<p class="Text">Hearing the words of Mahatmaji, Navin was overpowered with happiness. Tears streamed forth from his eyes. He began to serve Jagdamba with the exclusive devotion. Sharad Thakur and his wife, both were very happy to see the change in their son.</p>
<p class="Text">By virtue of divine adoration his inner organ became quite sanctified He had become an embodiment of devotion. While meditating on Mother, sometimes he wept, sometimes he laughed, sometimes danced and sometimes began to run here and there calling ‘mother-mother’. If he sat, he went into trance.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, in the morning, Jagdamba Katyayani appeared Herself. Opening the eyes, Navin saw—a great holy radiance is there. The Mother is seated on the back of the lion, Her face is happy, there are three beautiful eyes, a beautiful necklace in the neck, the armlets of precious gems and bangles are there in the arms. On the beautiful matted hair there is the charming crown. In the feet anklets are tinkling. She has donned the silken garments. On the head half-moon is embellished. Like the crores of moons there is the cool brilliant splendour of Her body. There are ten hands which are embellished with sword, sheild, thunderbolt, arrow, bow, noose, conch-shell, bell, lotus and trident. The sweet flow of the nectar of compassion is flowing from Her affectionate eyes. There is sweet smile on the lips, as if She is standing spreading the corner of her Sari taking the offspring in her lap after making fearless to give the Supreme eternal bliss.</p>
<p class="Text">Navin was fully contented to see the facial appearance of the mother. The tears of joy began to flow from his eyes. The whole body was thrilled. The throat choked. He became speechless. After a long time by the inspiration of the Mother any how gathering patience, Navina eulogized the Mother. Lifting him up the Mother embraced him to Her bosom and caressed Her hands on his head and said—‘Son! You became blessed. Your preceptor will be invisible by passing away today. In the previous birth, you were My devotee. Guruji was your father. He has already attained My blessings. Due to some impediments, you have come to this world. It was, I, to send Guruji. Now by My grace, you accomplished your purpose. This is My command to you to go home and marry and serving Me at last enter My Supreme abode ‘Sachhidananddhan’. Your would be wife is also My devotee. Despite leading a domestic life, you will remain detached like lotus in the water.’ Having said, so, the Mother disappeared.</p>
<p class="Text">Navin saw, Guruji also has disappeared in accordance with the order of the Mother, Navin came back home and narrated the whole story to his parents. Their joys had no bounds, with great zeal Navin was married to the modest girl, named Tara. Tara and Navin, both being initiated in ‘Matri Mantra’ remained devoted to the mother throughout their life.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">The Devotee-Seth Ramanlal</p>
<p class="Text">Seth Ramanlal had his business in his own country and abroad at several places. The goods were being exported and imported through big steamers. Ramanlal was a devotee of saintly nature. He had indomitable faith in the God. He had full faith in <span class="char-style-override-2">Shrimad Bhagawat Gita</span>. Daily with great reverence, he contemplated <span class="char-style-override-2">Bhagawadgita</span> and according to the command of the Lord leading the pious unselfish life, he did business etc., according to his caste and stage in life for the pleasure of God—righteously. His wife Champabai was also a great devotee. In the house, there was the idol of ‘Shri Govinddevji’ and the both wife-husband used to worship the Lord regularly with the great devotion. In the day, the seth used to go to his business centre and after managing the business affairs for about six hours, he used to return home. He spent four hours in the cleanliness—bath, taking his breakfast and meal and the guests-service etc., and for four hours, he used to sleep. The rest ten hours was exclusively for devotional song—adoration, self-study, muttering and meditation. He was very regular and righteous in his routine work. What to talk of his hundred of accountants and managers and his servants and attendants even the other people were very much satisfied with his ideal virtuous behaviour. Whosoever came in his contact, used to be charmed with his love and warm well-wishing attitude. He was well-behaved, practical and transparent in accounts; but there was no question of the deceit or fraud or cheating in his business dealing. The altruism and modesty were his distinctive characteristics. He never showed his anger to anyone. He was always with smiling face with humble and modest eyes.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, his cook mixed salt-water in place of sugar in his sweet dish made of flour by mistake and in the vegetables, he mixed sugar in place of salt. He was sleepless the whole night due to the illness of his wife and he was very much worried also. That is why this mistake occured. When Seth Ramanlalji sat to take his meal, he felt the taste of the sweet dish of flour salty and the vegetables sweet but without salt. He looked towards the face of the cook. He was looking sad. The Seth asked him in his heartfelt sympathetic words—‘Maharaj! (the cook) Why are you so sad today?’ The cook, Labhashankar replied—‘The wife Brahmin is ill, that might be the cause of my dejected face.’ He didn’t disclose the fact of his sleepless night. But the seth came to guess to see his sleepless eyes. He said—‘Labhashankar, make haste to reach home after taking your meal—the wife Brahmin is all alone, look after her, some other one will work here in your place. Well, why did you come then? And really, brother! There is none else except you to look after your house. Certainly, you would have remained awakened also the whole night. I just send a man, he will sit there you may take rest.’ The cook got a relief and a great consolation. Blessing in his own mind, he went to his home.</p>
<p class="Text">After the departure of Labhashankar, Seth Ramanlal said to his wife slowly—‘Just see, this poor came on duty due to fear leaving his wife alone. He had not slept the whole night and he had the worry of his wife. So, he has mixed salt in the sweet dish of flour and sugar in the vegetables by mistake. If the other members of the family and the servants etc., come to know it they will mock at the Brahman and he will feel much humiliated. So, better it is to feed all these cooked objects to the cows going to the cow-shed and get the sweet dish of flour and vegetables cooked again soon, so that his mistake may not be leaked out to anyone.’ Champabai did so. No doubt, this is a triffling matter but it reflects the broadmindedness and generosity of Seth Ramanlal.</p>
<p class="Text">After some days, one day, smiling Champabai told Labhashankar about his mistake of that day. That poor got puzzled to hear this. He begged for pardon from the seth going to him. The seth said to him affectionately—‘Labhashankara! If I had been in your place, probably, I would have not been able to do any other work.’ You prepared the whole food and if there was a bit mistake in salt and sugar, what was the fault you did for which you have come to beg for pardon? Really, your intention was not bad.’ Labhshankar was highly gratified. He said humbly—‘Sethji! I know that you are very kind but why did you not point out my mistake?’ Seth Ramanlal said—‘Brother! You were already very much worried that day, I would have added to your sorrow to pointout your mistake. But in fact, if I never make any mistake then only, I should discuss your mistake. When, I, myself, am not free from any mistake and commit mistakes in normal position, then, why did I commit a new mistake to discuss your simple mistake in an unfavourable condition? Only he can have right to condemn for any one’s mistake who has never made any mistake in his life.’</p>
<p class="Text">Once, Ramanlal’s boats loaded with some goods sank into the sea. All the boatmen remained safe, but nothing of the goods could be saved. When the seth got the news, he said with his mind free from any morbid feeling—‘Certainly it was the earning of dishonest means. Otherwise, how the boat could sink in the categorical divine dispensation? Later on, he came to know that the goods from where it was being brought, the employees of the firm had made dishonest earning due to greed of money. The seth said—‘The Lord did very well that the boats loaded with sinful goods sank on the way. If this money had become our assets, then what would have been the state of affairs on our understanding being polluted?’</p>
<p class="Text">Once, on any branch of Ramanlal’s business centres the people looted the godowns of grains. The godowns were full with the grain of lacs of rupees. Hearing this news his kinsman came in the morning and to query about and  sympathise. At that time, the seth was reciting the <span class="char-style-override-2">Gita</span>. There was no sign of any sorrow on his face. There was natural peace and happiness on his face. He asked the visitors—‘How did you come here today at this time? If I may be of any service, please, order me.’ Not to see any sign of vexation on his face the visitors thought, ‘The news might be false.’ They said—‘We had heard that on any branch of your business centres a big robbery has occured but it was nice that it was a false news. The Lord did very well.’ Then, seth Ramanlal said smiling—‘The news is not false, but what you have said is absolutely true that the Lord did very well. Actually the Lord has favoured me by doing good to me in many ways. The secret of the Lord’s auspicious favour is known to Him only but what I have come to understand is that first He has put me on test that whether on the robbery of my wealth, I feel distressed or I welcome His divine dispensation gladly. Secondly, there are indication of famine in that state. I was thinking to offer some portion of the grain present there in the service of the brothers and sisters suffering from the famine. My Lord is there in their forms also. But I was delaying and there was the greed in my mind to save some of the grains, by the Lord’s inspiration those people in the form of the Lord distributed themselves the whole stock of the grain. They relieved me. Third, if anybody has taken something on account of greed, he has taken only. I have not usurped from anyone and fourthly the spiritual riches of benevolent feelings and the feeling of divine shelter are fully intact within by divine grace it has somewhat waxed.’</p>
<p class="Text">Hearing the words of Ramanlal, praising for his pious sentiments and being amazed on his praiseworthy conduct they returned.</p>
<p class="Text">When, the seth became fifty-sixth years old, calling his daughter’s son, Chhaganlal, Ramanlal, having no son, handed over his entire property and the whole responsibility to him and he, himself, alongwith his wife began to perform devotional song without any break going to the bank of the Narmada river leading the saintly life in a spirit of sacrifice. When he was about seventy years old, Lord Shri Govind Devaji graced both—wife and husband, blessed them with his divine vision by manifesting Himself. About three years after then, both the holy souls—wife and husbands passed away the same day having abandoned this perishable body for the eternal Supreme divine abode.</p>
<p class="Text-Black para-style-override-5">‘Jai to the devotee and his Lord!’<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">The Devotee-Ramanarayan</p>
<p class="Text">The devotee Lala Ramnarayanji was born in Punjab but since long, he had settled in Kashipuri, the abode of Lord Shankar. Some other people had also come with him from the Punjab. Daily early in the morning after bath in the Ganga, he used to glance the sight of the Lord Vishwanathji and then coming back home, he performed <span class="char-style-override-2">‘Parthiv Pujan’</span> (regalia worship), recitation of <span class="char-style-override-2">‘Shivsahastranam’</span> and the muttering of <span class="char-style-override-2">‘Mrityunjay mantra’</span> with love and devotion. The process of his worship continued till mid day. His wife, Sharada and son, Shambhu Sharan also were great devotee of Lord Shivaji. The continuous muttering of the benedicctory <span class="char-style-override-1">‘नम: शिवाय’</span> (Namah Shivoy) had become the nature of the whole family. By the grace of ‘Ashutosh Lord Shankara’ the business of Rama Narayanaji flourished a lot and within a short time, he became very prosperous. It is said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">कनक कनक तें सौगुनी मादकता अधिकाय।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">वे खाये बौरात हैं ये पाये बौराय॥</p>
<p class="Text"> ‘The intoxication in gold is hundred times more than that of thorn-apple (Dhatura), man becomes mad when he eats thorn-apple but he becomes mad just while getting the gold (riches).’</p>
<p class="Text">Generally, being this the rule even by the Lord Shankar’s grace the effect was completely opposit here. As by degrees, Ramanarayan’s riches and prosperity flourished by the same degrees modesty, meekness, sacrificing spirit and other divine traits went on enhancing. The riches, honestly earned by the noble persons is spent in noble deeds and in the service, according to this principle, Ramanarayan’s riches began to be used in good deeds. It enhanced his fame also. Although he was not the least interested in his fame and repute, he used to remain afraid of it at all. Yet where there is sandal, the fragrance diffuses. So, without willing, even the fragrance of his repute spread all around due to his saintly nature, humility and secret charity.</p>
<p class="Text">There was one Lala Dayaliram among those who had come from Punjab with him. He was jealous of Ramanarayan’s progress within his mind. Although Ramanarayanji by his nature, had a very generous and affectionate behaviour with him in all respects, but Dayaliram’s jealousy mentality went on increasing. Shri Ramanarayanji was quite unaware of it. But how long can the fire be hidden? The moment it gets the blow of wind and inflaming object it gets inflamed. Likewise just getting the chance, Dayaliram’s hidden fire of hostility came to blaze up. Now, he become hostile to Ramanarayan openly and began to try to harass, embarrass and harm him in different ways. Different kinds of efforts of hostility were started to be made from Dayaliram’s side in the form of abusing, getting him beaten by the bad elements, setting fire and causing loss in his business.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, Ramanarayanji was coming after taking bath in the Ganga. Abruptly, Dayaliram, himself came and gave him a shoe-beating. Ramanarayanji went away smiling. But he felt a great pity on his companion, Dayaliram’s mean attitude. He became grieved because of his evil tendency. He became distressed to worry not because of his own shoe-beating and insult but because of Dayaliram’s malicious attitude. He thought, how to reform Dayaliram’s mentality. He resolved in his mind to love him specially and acording to his resolve he started to practise it also. This is the law of Nature that when we develop the mentality of jealousy and hostility against anyone, the demon of our thought goes towards him and by creating the feelings of jealousy and hostility in his mind also attract them towards themselves. The same is the influence of the thoughts of selfishness, anger, violence, arrogance and greed etc. Thus, the evil thoughts mutually going on increasing make the whole atmosphere and whole life vicious. In its return if the thoughts of love are nourished for anyone, they reach there and supressing the thoughts of upsurged hostility existing in his mind create the sentiment of love in him. In this way if the sentiments of love are sent again and again by increasing if more and more then in the last, his feelings of hostility are vanished and he also starts loving—love begets love and hate begets hate. Lala Dayaliram had the mentality of hostility but Ramanarayan’s mind was full of strong and great love. So, Dayaliram’s hostile mentality could not influence Ramanarayan’s thoughts of love but contrary to it his evil thoughts began to be supressed by the strong thoughts of love and gradually being weak they began to return. Besides it Ramanarayan’s pure and strong thoughts of love began to reach there constantly and began to blot out the malicious mentality gradually. Now, Dayaliram began to repent also for his own actions sometimes at intervals.</p>
<p class="Text">On the other side, Ramanarayan could not have patience. He became restless to see goodness in Dayaliram as soon as possible. So, one day, in the night in a secluded place being pathetic made the piteous prayer to the Lord Ashutosh—</p>
<p class="Text">‘My Lord! I am very much grieved at this downfall of my companion, Lala Dayaliramaji, You are indweller of all, if I had the least malice against him or still it is so anywhere in my mind, then, punish me for this but endow him with the sentiment of peace, cordiality and love in his mind, if my suffering from the pain of the burning fire of hell may purify his innerself, then, my Lord! arrange it as soon as possible. If my prosperity, riches and repute are blessed by you, is the cause of his mental sorrow, O Lord! Take back all these Your objects. At once, make me street beggar, destitute and humiliated. What is the meaning of such riches-prosperity and glory-repute, which may prove the cause of anyone’s sorrow. And my Lord! As far as I know about my mind, I had never even made any prayer before my Lord for the riches and prestige. I have been trying always to invest the objects given by the Lord in the service of the Lord only considering it the belongings of the Lord following the command of the Lord. But to utter so is also my pride. What is my effort? It is the Lord who is inspiring me to do everything. At the moment also whatever I am saying, here also there is the inspiration of the merciful Lord only. Lord! Lord! It is my hypocrisy, certainly there must have been some evil mind, sinful mentality. My mind must have been full of some guilt really, that is why my companion has such an agitation in his mind. I am the main cause of the anguish and unrest of his life. How can I say that I had no ambition of riches and repute and I am using it rightly in the Lord’s service only. Lord! I am unable to trace out my sin. This is my next fault. My bountiful donor, the Lord Shiva! How much compassionate you are to me, I cannot say. Now, let it be so what my Lord deems fit. But my mind is unrest again and again by this sorrow how to get Dayaliram free from mental unrest....!’</p>
<p class="Text">The true prayer of the heart never does unresponded. And the Lord Shankar is verily Ashutosh. While just praying to the Lord, Ramanarayanji went into trance. He saw—The Lord is present sitting on the bullock. His glowing body has the outstanding whiteness of camphor, on the head, there is reddish brown matted and braided hair and in His neck the serpant ‘Vasuki’ is embellished. There is trident in one hand, a tabor in the second, the garland of ‘Rudraksha’ in the third hand and with the fourth hand, he is giving the assurance of fearlessness. He is wearing the bark of a bear in this waist. From his broad eyes as if the nectar of His grace is raining. His lips have mild smile. Shri Ramanarayanji was fulfilled to get the vision Lord Shankar. Tears of love began to flow from his eyes, his body was horripilated, his throat choked due to immense joy. The Lord put his lotus hands assuring protection on his head and said—‘Ramanarayan! Your love, devotion and selfless service has taken me under sway. This Dayaliram was a monster ghost in his previous birth and in the previous birth of the last birth, he was a Brahman of south and you were a merchant there at the same place. You were of a pious mind then even. Despite being a Brahman due to bad company, he drank wine and ate meat and used to earn money by plundering. He had become very cruel. One day, he attacked on your house also for robbery. At that time, also you gave him good treatment and after giving him the wealth according to his demand, you advised him to devote to Shiva to mutter ‘Namah Shivay’. Your noble behaviour had a very good impact on him and he began to worship. Once, going to Rameshwar, he had offered Me water and vilva leaves. As the result of his sins, he was born as a ghost in the next birth but due to your company and My worship, he got rid of this species of birth only in ten years and he again was born in the Kshatriya family. In the previous human body, his life was the house of hostility, violence, anger and jealousy, to torture the helpless persons and doing ill to even the well-wishers, had become his nature. On account of those impressions, he became hostile against you. But his hostile mentality did not have any effect on you because of your heart being perfectly free from hostility and full of pious love, contrary to it your love had such an influence on him that his heart went on getting purified by and by. Today, your prayer has such an influence on him that he has become completely pure. You are praiseworthy that you are transforming the evils to be good with your noble sentiments. I am very much pleased with you. I know it very well that you have not the least attachment with riches and repute. That is the reason why I am being served with that prosperity in an ideal way. I cannot be served with the riches of the attached persons. Having fulfilled your duties here with peace and pleasure you will attain my divine abode. Being carefree go on performing my adoration.’</p>
<p class="Text">As soon as the Lord Shankar disappeared having uttered so, that very moment Lala Ramanarayan’s trance broke. He saw—‘Dayaliram is weeping lying at his feet. Considering him favourite of the Lord Shankar, Ramanarayanji lifted him up. Dayaliram did not want to leave his feet. He was begging for pardon for his vicious acts again and again in piteous voice. He had a true sentiment of repentence. With the Lord Shankar’s blessings, Ramanarayanji’s noble thoughts and the flame of true attonement burnt his all the sins and the seeds of sins into ashes. Lifting him up Shri Ramanarayanji embraced him to his bosom and consoling him by all means and giving him the teaching of Shri Shankarji’s devotion bade him farewell.</p>
<p class="Text">The memory of the previous birth came back to Dayaliram’s mind. He engaged himself in the muttering the spell (Namah Shivay) and in the worship of Shri Shankarji with great devotion. His love with Ramanarayanji became indelible. Both the friends were fulfilled dedicating their lives in the service of Shri Vishwanathji.</p>
<p class="Text-Black para-style-override-5">‘Jai to the devotee and his Lord!’<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">The Devotee-Swami Ram Awadhdas</p>
<p class="Text">It relates to about one hundred years back. The great devotee of the Lord Shri Raghvendra, Swami Ram Awadhdas was a dispassionate Sadhu. He lived in Ayodhyapuri, the capital of ‘Maryada Purushottam Lord Shri Ramchandraji’ for several years. It had become his nature to remain always busy in loudly chanting of the Name of All-pervading Shri Sitaram. He used to sleep in the night hardly for two hours. He lived beneath a tree on the bank of the Sarayu river. The fire was kept on smouldering day and night. Even in the rainy season, he did not cover it with any shade. It is the matter of great wonder that even in the torrential rain the fire did not extinguish. Swamiji’s sweet sound of ‘Sitaram’ in a very charming tone could be heard anytime. All the persons of the neighbourhood—even the other living beings had learnt to pronounce the sound of ‘Sitaram’. The sound of ‘Sitaram’ was heard in the voice of the birds here. The tone of ‘Sitaram’ reflected even in the voice of cats and dogs here, in the clattering of the trees the name of ‘Sitaram’ was heard and the holy flow of the Sarayu river sang the name of Sitaram. The whole atmosphere there had changed into the form of Sitaram.</p>
<p class="Text">Sometimes Swamiji used to have religious discourses also and on the arrival of any distinguished officer whatever the logic and proofs of the Shastras he quoted in the support of his experience, proved that he was a great savant of the six schools of Indian philosophy, but at present he is engaged in devotional songs only leaving everything. In ‘Satsang’ also he gave the sermon of devotional song only and said ‘What can a man do?’ The Lord has blessed us with tongue and if one goes on repeating His name with it that is sufficient, the Lord blesses him with His grace and takes him in His shelter.</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji was a Vaishnav Sadhu, but he did not disapprove of any cult or community. He loved everyone considering him the devotee in the dfferent forms of his own Ramaji. He never contradicted anyone. The sweet smile always played on his lips. The people got amazed to see the lustre of his face even in his old age.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, he had related a narrative of his previous life from his own mouth to a gentleman. He had described to a saint of Ayodhyaji about this. Swami Ramawadhdasji was the Brahman of a place near Jaunpur. His name was Ramalagan. He was the only son of his parents. His mother was saintly and a great God-devotee. Since his very childhood, she had taught him the loud singing of Sitaram and she used to relate him the sweet mythological tales of the Lord’s character. Once, when he was eight years old, one day, some robbers entered his house. His father Pandit Satyanarayanaji was a learned person and had studied in Kashi. To work as the priest of many families, was his profession. His family was well to do. His father was not in the house on the day when the robbers had come. He had gone to the house of his any client in connection with marriage ceremony. In the house he himself and his mother were present. The both—mother and son were sleeping in the open courtyard inside the house. It was summer season, so all the doors were open. On one side the cows were standing. His mother was relating to him the story of the burning of Lanka by Hanumanji at that time. At the same moment, near about fifteen to sixteen armed robbers entered the house. His mother got frightened to see them, but he said—‘Mother! Why did you get frightened? Just see, just now, Hanumanji has set Lanka on fire. Why don’t you call him? Just when you call him, he will come to protect us.’ He uttered this sentence fearlessly. But the mother was trembling with fear. She didn’t believe that Hanumanji would come at her call. When the mother remained mum, he, himself said calling loudly—‘Hanumanji! O Hanumanji!! Who have entered my house with sticks! My mother is getting frightened. Come on, make haste to come; burn the Lanka later on.’ The robbers had hardly entered the house that within moments a monkey was seen coming jumping over and above; The robbers were just aiming their sticks at him that he gave such a hard slap to two to three robbers that they fell down on the ground. The captain of the robbers moved ahead. Then, knocking him down he stretched his beard so forcibly that he shrieked and fainted. The bamboo-stick of the robbers proved meaningless and fell down from their hands. Not a single stick could injure the monkey. By the roar of the robbers the neighbourers gathered within no time. The robbers ran away. The captain was yet unconscious, three to four robbers taking him on their shoulders ran away. The child Ramlaganji and his mother were watching this scene with great astonishment. On the gathering of the neighbourers, the monkey disappeared jumping up towards the same direction from which he had come. Laughing Ramlagan was saying—‘Did you not see mother! Just hearing my words, Hanumanji reached here and made the wicked robbers run away. the mother’s astonishment and joy had no bound. When the villagers heard about this occurence all were amazed. Ramlagan’s mother said that she had never seen such a strong and big monkey in her whole life.</p>
<p class="Text">After two or three days, Pandit Satyanarayanji came back home and when he heard this news, he felt overjoyed. The robber fled away was no doubt, the cause of happiness already; but for him the great joy was that Hanumanji, himself, having appeared sanctified this house and saved the lady Brahmini and the son. He had already devotion in the Lord but now, his devotion became more ardent. Almost he stopped to visit his clients and he began to remain engaged in the devotional song and spiritual practice. The responsibility of teaching grammar and rituals of Shastras to the child, Ramlagan was of Pandit Vinayakji of his own village. In the morning, he studied about three to four hours. He also passed the rest time in the worship and devotional song with his mother and father. His mind got anchored in the devotional song. When he became twelve years old, he used to meditate on Shri Ramchandraji for hours together. At that time, he used to be in deep meditation. There the tears flowed from his eyes. He was quite oblivious of the exterior. When he opened his eyes from the meditation, he used to say to his mother and father that the Lord Shri Ramchandra along with Sitaji and Lakhanlal was sitting there on the priceless royal throne. This condition of the child gave a great joy to his fortunate mother-father. They were not like the modern mother-father who engage their sons to the sensuousness knowingly and spoil their life by training them different kinds of dishonest practices to earn money. They were the true well-wishers of their son. When they saw their son obsessed in the Lord’s love and meditation, they got boundless joy. They considered themselves the most fortunate.</p>
<p class="Text">Really, it is the fact. Shri Sumitraji says to her fortunate Ram-devotee son, Lakshmanji—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">भूरि भाग भाजनु भयहु मोहि समेत बलि जाउँ।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">जौं तुम्हरें मन छाँड़ि छलु कीन्ह राम पद ठाउँ॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">पुत्रवती जुबती जग सोई। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">रघुपति भगतु जासु सुतु होई॥</p>
<p class="SHLOK">नतरु बाँझ भलि बादि बिआनी। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम बिमुख सुत तें हित जानी॥</p>
<p class="SHLOK">***</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सकल सुकृत कर बड़ फल एहू। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम सीय पद सहज सनेहू॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘It is your great good fortune as well as mine. I solemnly declare that your mind abhorring any evil course has sincerely taken up its abode in Ram’s feet.’</p>
<p class="Text">That woman alone can be said to have borne a male issue, whose son is a devotee of Ram (the Lord of Raghus). Otherwise she had better remain issueless; for she who deems herself fortunate in having a son hostile to Ram has yeaned in vain.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">* * *</p>
<p class="Text">‘The highest reward of all meritorious acts is verily this—to have spontaneous natural love for the feet of Sita and Ram.’</p>
<p class="Text">Considering Lakshmanji’s departure for the forest her great luck, the mother sacrifises herself on her son and praising her womb, she declares the spontaneous love for the lotus feet of Shri Sitaram as the highest reward of all her meritorious acts. Actually, those parents are blessed whose issue is the devotee of the Lord and who may surrender their issues in the service of the Lord. Shri Goswamiji Maharaj says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">जाके प्रिय न राम बैदेही। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तजिये ताहि कोटि बैरी सम </p>
<p class="SHLOK">जद्यपि परम सनेही॥ </p>

<p class="Text">‘Tulasidasji says that he whom Ram and Sita are not dear must be abandoned like the greatest enemy even though he might be great affectionate. Prahlad abandoned his father, Vibhishan left his brother, Bharat gave up his mother, Bali sacrificed his preceptor and the Gopies left their husband for the Lord Shri Krishna and they were all happy and blessed. He only should be considered kith and kin, the closest friend well-wisher and worthy of service, who has love for Rama. What is the use of collyrium if it blinds eyes? It is enough what to say more. Tulasidas says that with whose association we develop love in Rama’s feet is our great well-wisher and worthy of adoration and dearer than even life. This is my opinion.’</p>
<p class="Text">Ramalagan’s parents were truly affectionate to their son. They considered their true and moral duty to make their son the pilgrim of the Supreme abode; that is why they took pleasure to see the devotion of their son and encouraged him also. When the village people and other relatives told him for the Ramalagan’s marriage, smiling the mother and father answered them—‘This Ramalagan is not our son, he is the son of the Lord Shri Ramachandraji; this is His right whether to marry him or not. We know nothing.’ Some of them got irritated to hear such words of the parents and some were pleased to hear this and some considered it their foolishness. Everyone reacts according to his own feelings.</p>
<p class="Text">As Ramalagan grew up, his love and devotion in the Lord went on increasing. Once, on the occasion of Ramanavami-fair, Ramalaganji expressed his desire to go to Shri Ayodhyaji. Pandit Satyanarayanaji and his wife thought—‘Now, let us live in Awadh, it is better in all respects. Let the rest of life pass there. Ramalagan should also accompany us. It will strengthen his devotion also and our life will also reform.’ Having decided so and with the consent of his wife Panditji donated mostly household objects and maximum of the lands in charity. He kept with him only so much land that might serve them to pull on their life. He handed over his field to a cultivator on the condition to give him the certain share of the crop every year and all the family members went away to Ayodhyaji. At that time, Ramalaganaji was fifteen and half years old. Mother, father and the son—all the three began to devote exclusively to Rama, the Lord of Awadh being the inhabitants of Awadh. Exactly after four years, the father and mother—both passed away on ‘Ramanavami’ day. The both had consciousness till the last moment of life and remained engaged in divine adoration. Just a few minutes earlier to their death, the Lord Shri Ramachandraji blessed the both by His vision. At that time, Shri Ramalaganji was ninteen and half years old. After performing the funeral rites and other rituals of his parents, he took initiation from a Saint, devoted to Lord in the prescribed way. Since then, he was called by the name of ‘Swami Ramawadhdasji’.</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji had acute detachment. He did not keep any possession. Shri Sitaramji, Himself, cared for his living. Neither he got any hut built for himself nor he made anyone his disciple and nor he had any ostentation. His only job was to share collective singing and remain obsessed in the meditation of the Lord. This was his only job.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">He had the opportunity to be blessed by Hanumanji with his apparent vision several times. He got the apparent view of Shri Ramachandraji also seven times. At last, he abandoned his body lying his head in the lap of the Lord Raghavendra. It was the common belief of the people that he was a staunch devotee of eminence. He lived his life in secrecy.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">The Devotee-Balakaram</p>
<p class="Text">The devotee Balakramji lived in the village, named Rajnagar. This was a small village. Inhabitants of this village were mostly Brahmans. Balakaramji was a Kanyakubja Brahman. His parents were highly righteous and sattvic. They died when Balakramji was in a very early age. Balakaramji was broughtup by his widow paternal aunt. There was a primary school of one Panditji in the same village. Balakramji got the education in ‘Sanskrit’ from that very school. In the absence of his mother-father there was none to arrange his marriage. He, himself, was of dispassionate nature since his birth. So, he never even imagined of marriage. So, he strictly observed celibacy. He was physically elegant, handsome and of bright fair complexion, a grand youngman. There was a wonderful lustre in his eyes. He used to get up early in the morning at 3 O’clock and wash his hands and face he used to sit in the meditation of Shri Sitaramji. After two hours in meditation and then after being free from the daily ablutions and morning prayers etc., he used to meditate upto twelve in the noon. After that, he used to cook something for himself and offering the oblation to the Lord, he would eat the remaining. Then, there was no need to eat anything in all the twenty-four hours. He kept himself closed in the hut throughout the day and performed devotional song without any break. In the evening about two hours before the sun-set, he came out of the hut. Then, the villagers gathered there. There used to be different spiritual discussions. He advised everyone for divine adoration. He used to enhance the dedication of the audience for the devotional song by reciting verses of<span class="char-style-override-2"> Bhagawat</span> and stanzas of Manas at intervals. Again being free from evening ablution and prayers etc., he closed the gate in the evening.</p>
<p class="Text">He was very much steadfast in his devotion. The sacred name of the Lord used to be pronounced from his mouth all the twenty-four hours. He used to explain the glory of the Lord’s Name by quoting the following stanzas again and again—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">नाम भजो मन बस करो, यही बात है तंत। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">काहे को पढ़ि पचि मरो, कोटिक ज्ञान-गिरंथ॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नाम जपा सो सब किया, तीरथ बरत अनेक। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नाम आप भगवान् हैं, राखैं जनकी टेक॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम नाम जपते रहो, जब लगि घटमें प्रान। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कबहूँ दीन दयालके, भनक परैगी कान॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नाम नाम सम नाम है, और सभी बेकाम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नाम जपत सहजै मिलैं, साहेब सीताराम॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम नाम मनिदीप धरु, जीह देहरी द्वार।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तुलसी भीतर बाहिरौ, जौ चाहसि उँजियार॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कहौं कहाँ लगि नाम बड़ाई। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">रामु न सकहिं नाम गुन गाई॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नहिं कलि करम न भगति बिबेकू।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम नाम अवलंबन एकू॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘Repeat the ‘Name’ of Rama and subdue the mind and that is the real essence. Why unnecessarily read all the Vedas and Shastras, the knowledge of all the books, everything is useless as compared to the ‘Name’. He, who repeated the ‘Name’ accomplished his goal. By repeating the ‘Name’ only the fruit of all the pilgrimages is attained. The ‘Name’ in itself is the Lord and fructifies all the purposes. It is onlly the ‘Name’ the only support of human being. So, go on repeating the ‘Name’ of Rama so long as you are alive. By constant remembering there may be a time it will reach to the ears of the merciful Lord of the humbles. All the other objects are meaningless, It is peerless, it is only the ‘Name’ worthy to mutter. By repeating the ‘Name’, ‘Sitaram’ is easily attained. Instal the luminous gem in the shape of the divine name ‘Rama’ on the threshhold of the tongue at the doorway of your mouth, if you want to have light both inside and outside.</p>
<p class="Text">Tulasidas says that the glory of the ‘Name’ is beyond description. It is impossible to praise the glory of the Name. In the age of Kali, neither action nor devotion nor wisdom can help you. The name ‘Rama’ is the only resort.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, he was sitting alone out of his hutment before the fall of the evening and he was repeating the name of Shri Rama; in the meanwhile a beautiful lady saluted at his feet and placing some fruits before him said—‘Maharajji! I am the daughter-in-law of the landlord of a nearby village. I am issueless. I have heard of your repute as a Mahatma, so I have come all alone in your service. If you bless me, I iwll become the mother. You are kind-hearted, I beg of you spreading the corner of my ‘Sari’.’</p>
<p class="Text">Balakramji said with great scruple—‘Sister! You should not go to any other male out of the house all alone in this way. It is not known, how many selfish men are moving here and there in the garb of saints. Then, sister! I have no occult power, neither I have any supernatural power of spell or penance, that I may bless you. I am a poor and humble Brahman. Any how, I pull on my life in the Lord’s name. The people treat me a devotee or saint, it makes me more shameful. I don’t deserve even to get the dust of saints and devotees feet. Sister! Go, it is not proper to remain out of the house in the night. Remember the Lord, pray to Him, What He thinks right, He will do and it will lead to your well-being. There is no doubt in it.’</p>
<p class="Text">To hear the words of Balakaramji, she felt a great disappointment, but what she could do! She returned. Balakaramji said—‘Your house is four miles away from here, it is getting dark. Remain alert on the way. The Lord will do good to you. If any mishappening occurs, mutter—‘Shri Sitaram-Sitaram!’ The daughter-in-law of the landlord had moved hardly one furlong onward on the way, when the thieves surrounded her to see her ornaments. When she had come, the thieves were on the look since then. She found herself in a great trouble and with faith in her mind praying to herself she began to call—‘Sitarama-Sitarama’. In the mean time, she saw that a wheatish handsome youngman armed with weapons was coming running and the devotee Balakaramji was also behind Him. In the twinkling of an eye, coming there the young man gave a strong hurt on the thieves. The same moment, the thieves ran away saving their lives. The landlord’s daughter-in-law saw no trace of the young man and Balakramji both after then. She presumed as if it were a dream but what a dream while going on the way? She was amazed. In the meanwhile some men of her house whom she had already called, happened to come and she went back home with them.</p>
<p class="Text">But Balakarama’s free from yearning, tranquility of mind, simplicity, the saintliness, and the absence of egoism  and the glimpse of Shyamsunder left an emphatic impact of purity on her mind. She understood that it was the apparent Lord Raghavendra to protect her from the thieves and this all happened due to the grace of His devotee Shri Balakramaji. Whatever it may be but it was the worst day for her, God knows what an inauspicious occurence was about to take place. But I reached the hutment of Mahatmaji and I was saved in the wonderful way. The most amazing was that her desire of son vanished from her mind and in its place the desire of devotional song flourished. Her innerself got detached by the influence of the company of the virtuous person only of a few moments. On its pretext she got the rare vision of the Lord also. What is impossible by the company of saintly persons?</p>
<p class="Text">Reaching house, she concentrated her mind to the divine worship and later on she was highly evolved spiritually. It is said that the Lord Shri Raghvendra was highly graceful to her. And then she got the view of the Lord whenever she wanted. Her constant contact with the Lord developed.</p>
<p class="Text">The devotee Balakaramaji did not disclose it to anyone. It is not known whether he knew this sportive play of the Lord or not. This miracle came to the public knowledge through the daughter-in-law of the landlord only.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, on the occasion of Ramnavami the devotee, Balakramji desired to go Awadh. He set out with a round type of a jug, rope and satchel-rosary. Rajnagar was at the distance of six hundred miles from Ayodhya. Only three days were left to Ramnavami. Balakaramji had a very strong desire to see the auspicious birth-ceremony of the Lord reaching there but there was no means. He had no idea of possessing any occult or miracalous power in himself. His only support was the muttering of the Lord’s Name and to drink constantly the nectar of His charming appearance through his eyes of meditation. The evening set in on the way. He reached near a pond. There was a very old banyan tree on the side of the pond. He thought to pass his night there. After taking bath in the pond and evening prayer he sat there for meditation. Within a few moments he got obsessed with the charming appearance of the Lord. He went into the deep meditation. In the morning when his trance broke, what he sees, he finds himself sitting on the bank of the mother Sarayu river under a peepal tree in Ayodhya and the Lord Rama is smiling standing before him. Balakramji was in ecstasy. His body thrilled in the emotion of love. He became speechless. The tears of love were flowing from his eyes. In that rapturous state, he moved towards the temple of Awadhesh. He saw clearly—Shri Kaushalendra is going ahead of him and he is following Him as if drawn towards Him. Just reaching inside the temple that image of Kaushalendra disappeared. Now, Balakaramji came to his senses. The preparation of the birth ceremony was being made in the temple. The Lord had already introduced Balakaramji to the priest of the temple before hand in the dream. The priest recognised him. He gave him a warm welcome; but ecstatic state of Balakramji’s was yet not completely off. Being mad in the same, he began to dance before the Lord. The benedictory appearence of Lord Shri Rama, Bharatalalji, Lakshmanaji and Shatrughnaji was before him. He was absorbed in the same emotion. The people saw that abruptly his crown head burst and it resounded with the sound of Ram. His body fell down there being lifeless. Everyone can presume to what supreme state he attained on death.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-13">The Firm determined Brahman-devotee</p>
<p class="Text">There lived a Brahman in a village near Krishna Nagar. He was a priest by profession. One day, while coming back after performing certain worship at his clients house, he saw on the way that a female seller of vegetables was selling the vegetables sitting on a side. There is a rush. Someone is getting the vegetable weighed and someone is bargaining. Panditji used to pass same way daily and see the female vegetable seller also there. One day, he also stopped there to see any known person purchasing the vegetables. He saw—the female vegetable seller has one measure of stone. She is weighing one seer of vegetables also with the same weighing stone so also of 5 seer. Panditji was much astonished. He asked the female vegetable-seller—‘You weigh everyone with the same weighing-stone. Is the weight of everyone exact?’ An acquaintance of Panditji said—‘Yes, Panditji! This is a matter of great surprise. We have already visited it to get the purchased vegetable weighed at another shop several times, the weight was accurate.’ After a little halt Panditji said to the female vegetable-seller—‘Daughter! Will you give me this stone? The female vegetable-seller said—‘No, Babaji! I will not give it to you. I have got it after a great difficulty when my weighing stones were lost, my elder brother and my mother used to beat me. Three years ago, my weighing stones were lost, when I reached home my elder brother beat me. In the state of weeping, I came on the river bank and sat down there and began to call the Lord in my mind. In the meanwhile a stone touched my feet. Lifting it up in my hand, I said to Thakurji—‘Maharaj! I don’t know to weigh, bless me with such a grace that all the weights may be measured with the same weighing stone.’ Enough! Since then this is with me. Now, I don’t need separate weighing stones. It solves my whole purpose. Tell me, how should I give it to you?’ Panditji said—‘I will give enough money for this.’ The female vegetable seller said—‘How much money will you give for it? Will you give me the expenses for going to Vrindavan? All have gone the Vrindavan; only, I remained deprived of going there.’ The Brahman asked—‘How much money do you require for your work?’ The female vegetable-seller said—‘Total three hundred rupees, I want.’ The Brahman said—‘Well daughter! Do tell me where do you keep this stone?’ The female vegetable-seller said—‘I keep it in this basket, Babaji! and wherever else I will keep it.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Brahman came back home and sat down in silence. The lady Brahmin asked her husband—‘Why are you sitting in such a sad mood? It is so because of being late.’ The Brahman said—‘My mind is upset, I need three hundred rupees.’ The lady Brahmin said—‘What is the matter of worry here? It is you who had provided me with many ornaments. If you are in urgent need, take them away, if the luck favours they will be procured again.’ Saying so the lady Brahmin put off her ornaments.</p>
<p class="Text">By selling the ornaments, the Brahman managed for the money and the next day, going to the female vegetable-seller, he gave her the money and took that stone in return. Going to the Gangaji, he washed it well and after taking bath, he returned home. In the meantime, a small tender child came and said to the simple hearted Brahmini ‘O Mistress! Thakurji is coming to your home, sweep the house well and decorate it. The simple-hearted lady brahmin swept the house and decorated it with the objects of worship. When the brahmin saw coming there, he was surprised. On the query to the lady brahmin, she told him about the small child’s statement. Panditji was more surprised to hear this. Placing the stone on the throne Panditji worshipped it. Then, again he placed it in a upper small recess in a wall.’</p>
<p class="Text">In the night, the Lord said to him in the dream—‘Make haste to return Me back, otherwise it will not be good to you. You will meet your doom.’ The Brahman said—‘Whatever may come upon but I will not return You.’ The Brahmin began to worship with the objects, leaf of flower what could be available in the house. After about two to four days, again He said in the dream—‘Throw out Me there, otherwise your son will die.’ The Brahman said—‘Let him die, I will not throw You out.’ The month had hardly ended that the Brahman’s only son died. After some days, he saw the dream again one day—‘It is better for you—‘Even now return Me, otherwise your daughter will die.’ The firm determined Brahman answered the same as before. After some days, his daughter died. Again He said—‘This time your wife will die.’ The Brahman again answered the same. Now, his wife also died. Still the Brahman remained unmoved. The people thought that he had gone mad. After some days passed again it was said in the dream—‘See, still there is time. Agree to Me, return Me otherwise the lightning will fall upon your head within seven days.’ The Brahman said—‘Let it fall, I am not ready to place You in the dirty basket of the female vegetable-seller.’ Wrapping it in a thick cloth the Brahman tied the Lord on his head tightly. In this way, always he kept on tied Him on his head. The lightning thundered—came near, but returned back. Only three days were left. One day, the Brahman was performing worship on the bank of the Ganga when two handsome children coming near him jumped into the water. One of them was dark and the another one was white. Their bodies were smeared with mud. They jumped into the water in such a way that the water splashed on the body of the Brahman. The Brahman said—‘Who are you brothers? Whether this is the way to jump into the water. Just see, it sprinkled on my Lord also. Don’t you see, I was busy in worship?’ The children said—‘O! There was a splash on your Lord also! We didn’t notice, Baba, don’t get annoyed.’ Panditji said—‘No, brother! I am not angry. Tell me, whose sons are you? I never saw such a charming appearance. Where do you live brothers? Oh! What a sweet speech mixed with nectar!’ The children said that we live quite near. Would ever I will be able to see you?</p>
<p class="Text">The children said—‘Why not, Baba! We will just come when you call.’ On the query of their names by Panditji—‘We are not popular by any single name whatever name appeals to him he calls us by that very name.’ Saying this much the dark coloured boy said—‘Take this flute, when you need, play on it, we will come there at once.’ Giving him a flower the second fair complexioned boy said—‘Keep this flower safe with you, it will prove auspicious to you.’ Until they went away from there, the Brahman remained staring at them without the winking of the eyes. He began to think to himself—‘Oh! How handsome are these both! Is it possible to get view of their appearance again?’</p>
<p class="Text">The Brahman thought to see the flower—‘This flower is very charming, what a sweet fragrance is diffusing from it! But what will I do with it and where will I place it? Then, it is better why not to offer it to the king? It is a new thing and he will be pleased.’ Thinking so, he went to the king and offered it to him. The king was very much pleased. He went into the palace and gave the flower to the elder queen. In the mean time, the younger queen reached and said—‘Get me also such a flower, otherwise, I will die drowning into the water.’</p>
<p class="Text">The king came to his court and sent his attendants to search out Panditji. In the course of search, the attendants saw that the Brahman was muttering sitting under the shade of a tree having tied the stone on his head. They brought him before the king. The king said—‘Maharaj! I want one more similar flower.’ Panditji said—‘O the king! I had only one flower with me, but see and wait, I try.’ The Brahman set out in search of the two boys. Suddenly, the words regarding the flute came to his mind. He played on flute. At the same moment, the couple of the dark and fair the both boys appeared. The Brahman was in rapture having seen their charming appearance. After some time, he said—‘Brothers! I want one more flower of the same type. I had offered the flower given by you to the king. The king has demanded one flower more of the same type.’ The fair boy said—‘I don’t have now the flower, but I will lead you to such a place, where there is a garden flourished with such flowers. You, close your eyes.’ The Brahman closed his eyes. Holding his hands, it is not known where and by which way the boys took him away in the twinkling of an eye. Reaching a place when the Brahman opened his eyes, he was charmed. It is a very charming place, all around the beautiful creepers and sweet fragrance of flowers is scented. In the middle of the garden there is a grand beautiful place. When the Brahman saw he found that the boys had disappeared. Holding courage, he moved ahead. Entering the palace, he finds the very pleasant place decorated in all respects. In the mid, there is a throne  with divine gems and jewels. The throne is void. Considering it a temple, Panditji saluted it. Being untied the stone of Thakurji tied on his head fell down on the floor. Just as Panditji stretched his arms to lift it, the stone burst and the Lord Lakshminarayan manifested from it and became seated on the throne.</p>
<p class="Text">Smiling, the Lord Narayan said to the Brahman—‘How many miseries, I caused you but you remained unmoved. Despite your sufferings you did not abandon Me, remained holding Me. That is why I have brought you here in the embodied state.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">ये दारागारपुत्राप्तान् प्राणान् वित्तमिमं परम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">हित्वा मां शरणं याताः कथं तांस्त्यक्तुमुत्सहे॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘How can I leave the devotees who are seeking shelter in Me abandoning their wife, son, home, preceptor, life, riches, this world and the next world all?’ See here—It is your wife standing here, your son and daughter. </p>
<p class="Text">They are also saluting Me. All of you attained Me. By the firmness of your single one, the whole family got deliverance.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-14">The Devotee-Venkata</p>
<p class="Text">A Brahman, named Venkata, lived there in a small village Pulivendala on the bank of Papaghni river in South. The Brahman was a great devotee of the Lord Shri Ranganathji. He muttered the sacred Name of the Lord day and night. Brahman’s wife was Ramaya by name. She was  also devoted to the Lord like her husband. His mother and father both had died and he had no issue, so the family consisted of only the Brahman and his wife, the two persons. The both had a great mutual love to each other. They always comforted each other with their behaviour and conduct.</p>
<p class="Text">The father was the royal priest, so he had earned sufficient riches and property from his clients. He was of a high moral conduct, learned, God-devotee and savant. He had said to Venkata at the time of death—‘Son! In the Southern room of my prayer room in the middle of the courtyard seven earthen pots full of gold coins are buried. I have earned the riches with hard labour. It is very shocking to me that I could not utilize it in my life. Son! There are three courses of the riches—The best use of the its is to utilize it with own hands in the service of the Lord by using it in the virtuous deeds, the second use of the riches is to use it in the enjoyment of self comforts as well as in the comforts of the issues as per ordains of scriptures and third and the meanest course is neither to utilize in the service of the Lord nor in self-comforts. It is usurped by others or spent it in the evil deeds either by one’s own hands or by the hands of others. By the Lord’s grace if the son is of virtuous merits, then the money is utilized in the noble deeds, otherwise the same wealth is wasted by the unworthy son in the most immoral works—in drinking wine, prostitution and gambling etc., and thus, he becomes the cause of sending the several generations to the hell. Son! You are the worthy son—so I am confident that you will not misuse this money. I want that you should give me peace by spending the whole money in the Lord’s service. Son! That money is useful which is used in the service of the distressed persons in the form of Lord incarnate. That is why the rich persons are called fortunate. Otherwise there is nothing so bad as the riches. There is the intoxication in the wealth which carries away man’s discrimination and by creating disaster in different ways pushes him down into the pit of crimes. Lord Shri Krishna has said to the foremost devotee Uddhav—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">स्तेयं हिंसानृतं दम्भः कामः क्रोधः स्मयो मदः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">भेदो वैरमविश्वासः संस्पर्धा व्यसनानि च॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">एते पंचदशानर्था ह्यर्थमूला मता नृणाम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तस्मादनर्थमर्थाख्यं श्रेयोऽर्थी दूरतस्त्यजेत्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-2">Shrimadbha. </span>11/23/18-19)</p>
<p class="Text">‘(More over) Since the tendency to theft, violence, mendacity, hypocrisy, covetousness and anger, pride, arrogance, discord, animosity, distrust, a spirit of rivalry and fondness for women in general, love of gambling and addiction to wine—These fifteen evils found in men are root cause of being oppulent; therefore a seeker of (final) beatitude should abandon from a distance the evil going by the name of wealth.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Son! I was aware of this fact, that is why I did not disclose about this wealth till today. I wanted to utilize this money in the Lord’s service by my own hand; but the circumstances did not favour and my desire remained unfulfilled. Man should not postpone charity and virtuous deeds for the next day like adoration. It should be done at once without any delay. Tomorrow never comes. My whole life passed in postponing for tomorrow. My dear Venkata! All the fathers want to leave wealth after them for their sons having earned a lot, but I don’t want this. Son! I see clearly that the wealth is the sole cause of evil mind. So, I want to see you rich in ‘Devotion’ and not in wealth and property. That is the reason why I tell you to spend this entire wealth in the Lord’s service. To pull on your life whatever is there in the house as the parental property—land, fields and some to be gifted by clients as priest is sufficient. Maintain your life embued with simplicity, self-restraint and renunciation, proper for a Brahman, always follow the truth and remain engaged in the devotional song of the Lord Shri Ranganath. You will be satisfied only with this and this will be the prop for you to emancipate your forefathers. Son! Keep my this last teaching in your mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Venkata was wiser than his father. He said—‘Father! Each and every letter of your teaching is invaluable. Who one else can give such a teaching except a true well-wishing father? There are a number of parents to push on in the whirl round of life and getting entangled with the worldly enjoyments; but there are rare fathers like you to guide the easy way to get rid of the bondage of ignorance. You have done me a great favour not to give me this wealth. But father! I assume that you have given so much importance to the wealth by its so many evils to see my weakness. Basically, why should the mind of those who are devoted to devotion, go towards the riches? What is differene between the wealth and dust? Whatever is—Your words are reverent to me and I take your command as the clue of life and assure you to act upon and for your satisfaction without paying my attention towards wealth, I will invest it in the Lord’s service very soon. Now, withdrawing your mind from wealth, concentrate your mind in the Lord Shri Ranganathji and set out on your pilgrimage for the Supreme abode (salvation). As my mother had blessed me, you, too, must bless me likewise that I should never forget the Lord—My life should remain dedicated to the Lord and your this daughter-in-law should also make her life worthful by remaining engaged in the Lord’s service.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Saying—‘Be it so!’ the father concentrated his mind to the Lord and while voicing Lord’s name, his crown burst. Venkata and Ramaya saw—A bright radiance came out of his head  and merged into space.</p>
<p class="Text">Venkata performed the funeral-rite and rituals according to the ordains of Shastras. And duly feeding the Brahmans he completed his last secrament. Then, acting upon the father’s command, he took out the earthen pots of the gold coins from the ground and spent the most of the wealth in the Lord’s service by the service of the poors and destitutes.</p>
<p class="Text">Since then, the steadfastness in devotion of Venkat and Ramaya strengthened more and more. He dedicated his entire life in spiritual discipline. The wife also supported the husband and the husband supported the wife in the spiritual practice. If either of the two found the least flaw or the least possibility of downfall due to any reason, the second one saved the other by the proper advice, humble admonition and alerting through love each other. The both were the followers of the same path of the Lord and the both were the strength of each other. This is called the true domestic life of wife and husband.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, the both were dancing being absorbed in the Lord’s love and considering Him evident before them—glancing through their inner eyes and were rapturous in loudly singing divine Names. Usually, the Lord remains close to His devotees every moment, but today, He appeared in manifested form and He began to dance along with them. The devotee and the Lord both were charmed—The devotees were charmed with the Lord and the Lord was charmed with His devotees. It is unknown how long this dance of joy continued! By the God’s will when Venkata-Ramaya gained consciousness, they saw—The Lord Ranganathji is smiling standing between the both and holding the hands of the each with His separate each hand. To see the Lord face to face, the both were fulfilled. Their joys had no bound. Their bodies became loose in the emotion of love. The both fell down at the Lord’s feet. Having lifted up the both, the Lord placed the heads of the both on His each thigh separately and He began to caress his tender lotus hands on the both. In the meanwhile with the divine chariot the hosts of the Lord reached there. Mounting on the chariot the Lord along with the both devotees went away to the divine abode. It need not to say that the bodies of the both had become all consciousness and divine.</p>
