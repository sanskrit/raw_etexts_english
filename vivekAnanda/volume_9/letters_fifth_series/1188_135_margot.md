## CXXXV

*To Sister Nivedita*

THE MATH, BELUR,

*March 2nd, 1899*

MY DEAR MARGOT,

Will you look into your trunks for a Sanskrit book of mine, which was,
you know, in your keeping in Kashmir. I do not find it in our library
here.

I have been thinking of your friend Miss \[Sarala\] Ghosal's coming to
see the Math on Sunday. The difficulty is here. The ebb tide will be on
till 5 p.m. In that case our big boat can go down easily to bring the
party up; and going back, if the party starts long before 5 p.m., say 4
p.m., will be all right. To come up will take at least two hours from
Baghbazar. If the party starts from Baghbazar — say at 12 a.m. — and
reaches the Math at 2 p.m. for lunch and then starts back by 4 p.m., it
will be nice.

If you cannot start as early as that, I will advise you to send the
carriage to wait at Baranagore on the other side so that our boat can
ferry the party over any time they like. The boat journey in that case
will only be on coming.

With all love and blessings,

VIVEKANANDA
