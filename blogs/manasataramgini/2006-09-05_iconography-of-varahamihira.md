title = "Iconography of varAhamihira"

+++
varAhamihira was a Hindu encyclopedist who lived in the 500s of the CE
era. He may have descended from a family of shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas, as
suggested by the mihira epithet in his name combined with varAha. This
is also suggested by his tendencies for solar-system worship which
appears to have been a trait of the shAkadvIpI brAhmaNas or Iranian
Hindu brahmins. He covers an extraordinary range of topics in his
encyclopedic works ranging from astronomy, mathematics, rituals, yavana
jAtaka-s, augury, sooth-saying of various kinds, and worship of Hindu
gods through idols. In the same breadth he introduces some of the best
known trigonometric formulae like (sinx)^2 + (cosx)^2 = 1; the double
angle expansions like cos2\*x=1-2\*(sinx)^2; the factorial and its
relationship to combinations,  as well as the basics of Hindu
iconography. Thus, it is not suprising when we find trigonometry
mensuration and agamic issues pertain to idols being linked even the
works of the later day nambUtiri mathematician and tAntrika Chennas
Narayanan Nambutiripad.

In his bR^ihat saMhitA he gives a succinct section on construction of
icons of gods, which gives a good picture of what was the iconographic
situation around, 500-600 CE, the culmination of the gupta period. Many
of these topics are dealt with in great detail in the purANas and Agamas
of the various streams, but varAhamihira’s account appears to give a
summary of what was popular, such that it can be compared with surviving
temples of the period, like the glorious Udayagiri complex.

The deities who were iconographically depicted in varAhamihira’s times
were:  
1)rAma the son of dasharatha; 2) bali the son of virochana, the asura.
3) viShNu with 8 arms etc 4) balabhadra or the saMkarShaNa 5) sAmba 6)
pradyumna 7) ekAnaMshA (3-7 appear to represent a vaiShNava set parallel
to the set expounded in the iconographic chapters of the pA\~ncharAtra
tantras) 8)4-headed brahmA 9) kumAra or skanda 10) indra 11) rudra,
holding uma by his side 12) the buddha 13) the naked jain ascetic 14)
sUrya 16) li\~Nga 17) revanta 18) yama 19) varuNa 20) kubera 21)
vinAyaka 22) sapta-mAtR^ika
