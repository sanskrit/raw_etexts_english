We came face to face with her, she who shone with the luster of a
yoginI. She cast an inescapable jAla on you, which was much like the
pa\~njara of a powerful DAkinI. She was verily a manifestation of the
primeval cause of the most basic harSha. Her black hair framed her face
verily like the sharan-nishA framing the bright soma in a female form.
But unlike the cratered surface of the upAMshu her face was verily like
a gleaming tusk of a mighty gaja with her black hair framing it like the
blackness of the same ibha. Her grayish green eyes sparkled like that
companion of beta Cygni that delights an observer of the sky. The tilaka
on her forehead was like Antares illuminating the southern arc on a
summer night. Her black eyebrows streaked across her marble-like face
indeed like the dark lane across the galaxy Centaurus A. The sight of
her face was like the mada of milk-effused sweetened soma in the ritual
of the deva-s. Her sporting in the arNava of our manas was like the
manifestation of the power of the mantra of asura varuNa seen by vipra
gR^itsamada. Her emergence from a bath was verily like the eye of mitra
and varuNa rising over the great ocean; just as one daily beholds the
daivi in that luminary, her presence was truly a sign of the amartya-s
amongst mAnuSha-s â€“ an exemplary image in the canvas of genetic
recombination, verily like a Karl Gauss.
