## XXX

(*Translated from [Bengali](b7207e7030.pdf)* )

19 WEST 38th STREET,  
NEW YORK, *August*, 1895.

BELOVED RAKHAL,

. . . I am now in New York City. The city is hot in summer, exactly like
Calcutta. You perspire profusely, and there is not a breath of air. I
made a tour in the north for a couple of months. Please answer this
letter by return of post to England, for which I shall start before this
will have reached you. 

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
