title = "The mAraNa strike"

+++
The dumAvatI agent has a very special means of attack. It tries to
destroy all the supporting systems and armors, and then zeroes in on the
victim. It pressed ahead with the attempt at mAraNa. We parleyed with
the agent: it revealed a peculiar prayoga of the type only known to me
previously in the bauddha context. The mAraNa was to indirectly achieved
via a linkage to second person. This was similar to the fate of
nagArjuna when he met his end. The agent it trying to achieve this
linkage and finish us off. The kR^ityA hovers endless waiting to the
first opportunity to make the lunge. We just fled away the first time
the dart was hurled at us. The second dart now hit us but did not kill
us due to the past mantra bala. Who knows when the next dart may come.
