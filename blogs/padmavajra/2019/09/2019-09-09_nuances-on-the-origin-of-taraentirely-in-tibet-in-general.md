1\. Tibetan tradition states that tArA herself was introduced into Tibet
from Nepalese sources(the daughter of aMshuvarman),who got a sandalwood
image of the devI when she married the first great Tibetan king Songtsen
Gampo

2\. Bauddha tradition mentions just those two forms as introduced by
nAgArjuna from bhoTadesha:ekajaTA and possibly vajratArA(from the
sAdhanAmAlA)

3\. The 6-7th century aShTA\~NgasaMgraha mentions tArA and
mercury(nAgArjuna gets associated with rasAyana siddhis too in that
tradition),but no mention of nAgArjuna.  
4. ekajaTA,who is iconographically very similar to
mahAchInakrama-tArA(and often identical) got incorporated into Astika
sAdhanAs through the means of the pheTkariNI/pheTkarIya tanta which was
quoted by AgAmavAgIsha in his bR^ihat tantrasAra,which popularised this
form of tArA over other forms.(and these were the forms associated with
the story of vasiShTha going over to mahAchIna and recieving the mantra
from nArAyaNa in the form of buddha)
