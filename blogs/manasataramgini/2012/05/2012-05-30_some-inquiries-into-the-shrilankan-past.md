title = "Some inquiries into the shrIlankan past"

+++
Whereas Hinduson the mainland in white indological parlance  are reputed
to have no historical sense and consquently no history, their cousins on
the island are supposed to have a rich historical account in the form of
the pALi mahAvaMsha and the chULavaMsha. These sources have been the bed
rock of the current lankan ekIya and reinterpretted by the modern
sthaviravAdin saMgha with a distinct anti-Tamil and anti-Astika
emphasis. A study of the vaMsha-s themselves suggests that this
distinctly anti-Astika streak, while having older antecedents, has been
expanded more recently culminating in the dramiDa-siMhala mahAyuddha
that recently concluded with a massacre of the former. We have been
investigating this as part of an attempt to understand the older systems
of dharma in the island. This has several historical dimensions that
include: 1) The greater Astika influence and presence on the island in
the past; 2) The worship of Astika devatA-s within the bauddha framework
originally practiced on the island. 3) The role of the dramiDa-s,
chera-s and kali\~Nga-s at different points in the development of
practices in the island. A complete consideration of all this will
require a monograph, but that is not our intention here. Instead, we
simply collect a few vignettes that illustrate certain aspects of the
above points.

One point that caught our attention is centered on the life and time of
the shrIlankan hero parAkrama-bAhu-I (1153-86 CE) who is described as
the great upholder of the sthaviravAda tradition and it is unifier. The
lankans record with much pride his invasions of Myanmar and southern
India and on the whole in more recent times he has been presented as the
bauddha hero who brought down the Astika Tamils. The chULavaMsha records
interesting aspects of his life: 1) It mentions that he underwent the
upanayana ceremony given the mantra dIkSha by his uncle kIrti-shrI-megha
assisted by brAhmaNa-s well-versed in the veda (CHV 64.13-17). The
upanayana by brAhmaNa-s is not something which a pure follower of the
nAstika-mata would normally give in to. What it shows is that at least
kIrti-shrI-megha was conscious of his kShatriya varNa and observed its
practices in relation to the shruti, even though he was a bauddha. 2) In
this context it should be noted that his predecessor vikrama-bAhu is
mentioned as having performed vaidika shrauta rituals aided by his
purohita and R^itvik-s well-versed in the veda-s and vedA\~Nga-s. He too
is otherwise described as being a bauddha upholding the traditions of
the saMgha. Thus, it is clear that the medieval kShatriya-s of lanka
even though bauddha-s are likely to have not given up their vaidika
rites which are obligatory for a proper member of that varNa. 3)
Further, parAkrama-bAhu-I is described as having extensively built
several new deva temples and repaired those built earlier by choLa-s
(CHV 79.19, 22, 81), in addition to the bauddha relic shrines, tAthAgata
images and stupas and vihAra-s he was constructing. So the indications
are that he did support public worship of Astika deities within
shrIlankA and the available archaeological evidence appears to support
these records of the vaMsha.

Similarly, parAkramabAhu-II, in addition to performing daily vaidika
rites with the help of brAhmaNa-s, is described as having sponsored
brAhmaNa-s who maintained and taught “secular” saMskR^ita texts to the
lankans. Importantly, after his generals defeated the Indonesian naval
invasion of shrIlanka (sometime between 1245-1265) he went to
Devinuvara, which is southern-most port in the Indian subcontinent, to
renovate the temple of viShNu as an act of thanks-giving for his
victory. In this regard, it is of interest to note a ritual chant
deployed to viShNu preserved in lankan text called the
sarva-deva-kannalava used by bauddha-s of the island to worship Astika
and other local deities. Unfortunately due my difficulties with working
through the Lankan script all I have with me now is a translation of the
viShNu chant by a certain sItArAman:

Bearing a chakra in the right hand,  
with your body shiny blue,  
mounted on your vehicle garuDa,  
O viShNu, provide us with good luck.

O lord of the vaikuNTha mountain,  
guarding the four great devAlaya-s \[of shrIlankA\]  
accept our acts of puNya,  
bring wealth and good luck in our grasp.

shrIlankA and the buddhashAsana  
are under your protection, lord of vaikuNTha;  
O divine shrI viShNu, may you provide  
all that it good in every way.

In the sea, on land, in the sky and beneath or anywhere,  
cries from the high, low, poor and homeless or anyone,  
you have never let down anyone;  
O might deva, give me good protection.

Offering chandana, karpUra, lamps and flowers,  
mighty deva, we always seek your help;  
We offer you our acts of puNya – open your eyes  
and remove my troubles.

Of the deva mahAviShNu,  
there is great power and authority.  
If I have committed mistakes, forgive me;  
accept our acts of puNya, and save us.

This chant or its variants are widely used by the kapurAla-s or lay
bauddha-s in Devinuvara and other parts of the island. They are in
hybrid siMhala-pAlI-saMskR^ita language and are distinct from Astika
ritual texts, which are in saMskR^ita and drawn from various vaidika,
paurANika and tAntrika texts of the Astika canon. The printed version of
the sarva-deva-kannalava had pictures of viShNu seated on garuDa but his
depiction was different from the Astika form in that he lacked the
typical U-shaped UrdhvapuNDra on his forehead. This suggests that a
distinct lankan liturgy and iconography was developed for the same
Astika deities. Nevertheless, it is clear that the lankans repeatedly
received Astika inputs, in large part due to the proclivities of their
rulers. Indeed, in support of this we have some evidence based on
inscriptions that there were pA\~ncharAtrika brAhmaNa-s performing
rituals at Devinuvara at the time of parakramabAhu-II’s reign. Much
earlier, in the 800s of CE the shrIlankan ruler dapulusena is mentioned
as having brought in pA\~ncharAtrika brAhmaNa-s from Rameshvaram to
install the rakta-chandana idol of viShNu at Devinuvara and consecrate
it. Hence, there is evidence for a long pA\~ncharAtrika presence in the
hallowed shrine of Devinuvara. Thus, there appear to have been two
parallel but interacting tracks of ritual and iconography – one of folk
worship, such as that represented by the above text, which was followed
by the mass of bauddha-s and their kapurAla priests in shrIlankA, and
second of the brAhmaNa-s who were sponsored by key the kShatriya clans.
During the reign of rAjasiMha-I who was a largely Astika ruler among the
shrIlankan-s there was a major battle with the Portuguese terrorists.
The king had besieged them in the fort of Colombo in 1587 CE and had
reduced them to precarious state. In order relieve the pressure a
Portuguese armada attacked and destroyed the Devinuvara temple and
carried the idol studded with gems on their ship – interestingly, the
ship carrying the idol was lost at sea. After, this the brAhmaNa rituals
in Devinuvara appear to have had a hiatus and the precise knowledge of
the earlier traditions is largely lost. However, rAjasiMha-II (\~1635-87
CE) with auxiliary naval support from the marATha naval captain maynak
bhaNDArI recaptured Devinuvara and rebuilt the temple. However, there is
no evidence for any pA\~ncharAtrika revival at this point and it appears
that the folk lankan form of ritual and liturgy came to be norm.

The evidence for a hybridization of pA\~ncharAtrika and bauddha elements
in the liturgy of the kapurAla-s is clearly indicated by the rite of
tAmbula offering to viShNu. The chant which accompanies this ritual goes
thus as per the sItArAman translation:

After 5000 years of prosperity I will become a buddha,  
like the moon over the Milky Way, lankA will shine in its greatness;  
The golden screen of the palace of vaikuNTha opens;  
May your compassion last a 5000 years, the deva arrives\!

Seven chourie bearers holding golden bows and arrows on either side of  
the blue screens and shining white umbrellas in the middle of the
vaikuNTha palace,  
deva upulavanna \[blue lotus colored\] deva nArAyaNa will become the
buddha in the future.  
May you O nArAyaNa kindly accept our offerings of flowers and tAmbula.

The first two shloka-s are in pAlI-sIMhala hybrid and represent the
nAstika element. The remaining two are essentially saMskR^ita and the
last one in particular is a tAntrika mantra. These second two betray a
pA\~ncharAtrika origin. Interestingly the mantra explicitly mentions
pUrva-bhArata (eastern India) which might indicate a provenance in the
kali\~Nga country.

We suspect that the end of the kShatriya power in shrIlankA resulted in
an imbalance between the Astika elements supported by them and the
exclusivist nAstika interpretation of the bikkhu-s of the saMgha. In
1840s both the Astika-s, spearheaded by brAhmaNa polemicists like
kumAra-kArttikeya ayyar supported by various drAviDa leaders, and the
nAstika revivalists were focusing their attack on the pretamata and the
English. 1848 the nAstika-s organized the last great attempt to
overthrow the English power under gongalegoDa banDa, who denounced the
pretamata and vowed to fight the mlechCha-s with the aid viShNu. After
the English eventual defeated and humiliated him they suppressed any
royal worship of the deity. They also incited the saMghakAra-s to
insinuate this as a failure of viShNu and kumAra to help the lankans in
their attempt for freedom. With the loss of the royal patronage, and
English encouragement for nAstika separatism, the sthaviravAdin elements
similar to the old maitreya and dharmakIrti gained an upper hand in
their attempt to marginalize the worship of Astika deities.
