## CXII

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

ALMORA

*20 June '97*

DEAR MRS. BULL —

Herewith I take the liberty of introducing Miss Tremayne of London.

I like nothing so much as being serviceable to young and energetic
persons — and any help given to her in America will greatly oblige.

Yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA
