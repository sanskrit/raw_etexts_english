The Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa (1.1.29 of the Gopatha-brāhmaṇa) of the
Atharvaveda provides a glimpse of the Vedic saṃhitā canon as known to
the brāhmaṇa authors of the AV tradition. The Brahmayajña might be done
as part of the basic rite as done by dvija-s of other śākhā-s or as part
of the more elaborate AV tradition of the annual Veda-vrata. The annual
vrata-s of the Atharvaṇ brāhmaṇa-s include the Sāvitrī-vrata,
Veda-vrata, Kalpa-vrata, Mitra-vrata, Yama-vrata and Mṛgāra-vrata. The
kṣatriya-s and vaiśya-s should do at least 3 and 2 of them respectively,
with the first 2 being obligatory. During these vrata-s the ritualist
follows certain strictures like not consuming butter milk nor eating
kidney beans, common millets, or the masura lentils at the evening meal,
bathing thrice a day and wearing woolen clothing. Before performing
Brahmayajña, he performs the ācamana as per the vidhi which states:  
sa ācamanaṃ karoti \|  
He performs the ritual sipping of water.

This calls for the special Atharvaṇic ācamana described in the final
section of the ācamana-brāhmaṇa of the AV tradition (GB 1.1.39):  
tad apy etad ṛcoktam —  
It has also been thus stated in the ṛk:

“āpo bhṛgvaṅgiro rūpam āpo bhṛgvaṅgiromayaṃ \|  
sarvam āpomayaṃ bhūtaṃ sarvaṃ bhṛgvaṅgiromayam \|\|”  
The waters are of the form Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations. The waters are
imbued with the Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations.  
All being is imbued with the waters; \[thus,\] all \[being\] is imbued
by the Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations.

•The Atharvaṇ-s justify the above ṛk is by noting that the Paippalāda
Atharvaveda begins with the ṛk “śaṃ no devīḥ…” to the waters (see
below).

antaraite trayo vedā bhṛgūn aṅgiraso ‘nugāḥ \|\|  
Within these \[waters\] the three \[other\] Veda-s follow the
Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations.

“apāṃ puṣpaṃ mūrtir ākāśaṃ pavitram uttamam” iti ācamyābhyukṣy ātmānam
anumantrayata \| \[sūrya jīva devā jīvā jīvyāsam aham \|  
sarvam āyur jīvyāsam \|\|\]  
“The flower is the form of the waters, the empty space \[and\] that
which the most pure”. Thus, he sips the water and having sprinkled water
(practically mārjanam) he recites the incantation indra jīva etc:
Enliven, o Indra; Enliven o Sūrya. Enliven, o gods. May I live. May I
complete my term of life.

•The flower of the waters in the above incantation is an allusion to the
ṛk describing the the ancient action of the Atharvaṇ-s in kindling the
fire in waters \[from a lotus\]: \`\`tvām agne puṣkarād adhy atharvā nir
amanthata \|”  
•He does the ācamana by taking three sips each with two successive words
from the mantra apām puṣpam…

iti brāhmaṇam \|\|  
Thus is the brāhmaṇa.

Now for the Brahmayajña:  
kiṃ devatam iti ? ṛcām agnir devatam \| tad eva jyotiḥ \| gāyatraṃ
chandaḥ \| pṛthivī sthānam \|  
“agnim īḷe purohitaṃ yajñasya devam ṛtvijaṃ \| hotāraṃ ratnadhātamam
\|\|”  
ity evam ādiṃ kṛtvā ṛgvedam adhīyate \|\|  
Who is the deity? Agni is the deity of the ṛk-s. That is indeed light.
Gāyatrī is its meter. The earth is its station.  
“I praise Agni, the officiant of the ritual, the god and ritualist; the
hotṛ and the foremost giver of gems.”  
Thus, having placed it at the beginning the Ṛgveda is studied.

yajuṣāṃ vāyur devatam \| tad eva jyotis traiṣṭubhaṃ chandaḥ \|
antarikṣaṃ sthānam \|  
iṣe tvorje tvā vāyava stha devo vaḥ savitā prārpayatu śreṣṭhatamāya
karmaṇe \|\|  
ity evam ādiṃ kṛtvā yajurvedam adhīyate \|\|  
Vāyu is the deity of the Yajuṣ-es. That is verily light; Triṣṭubh is its
meter. The atmosphere is its station.  
“To you for nourishment, to you for strength. You are the Vāyu-s. May
Savitṛ impel you the most excellent ritual.”  
Thus, having placed it at the beginning the Yajurveda is studied.

sāmnām ādityo devatam \| tad eva jyotiḥ \| jāgataṃ chandaḥ \| dyauḥ
sthānam \|  
“agna ā yāhi vītaye gṛṇāno havyadātaye \| ni hotā satsi barhiṣi \|\|”  
ity evam ādiṃ kṛtvā samāvedam adhīyate \|\|  
The Āditya is the deity of the Sāman-s. That is indeed light. Jagati is
its meter. The heaven is its station.  
O Agni, come to the oblations, praised with songs to the ritual
offering. Sit as the hotṛ on the ritual grass.  
Thus, having placed it at the beginning the Sāmaveda is studied.

atharvaṇāṃ candramā devatam \| tad eva jyotiḥ \| sarvāṇi chandāṃsi \|
āpaḥ sthānam \| \<śaṃ no devīr abhiṣṭaya> ity evam ādiṃ kṛtvātharvavedam
adhīyate \|\|  
The moon is the deity of the Atharvaṇ incantations. That is indeed
light. All are its meters. The waters are its station. “May the divine
\[waters\] be auspicious for us…” Thus, having placed it at the
beginning the Atharvaveda is studied.

adbhyaḥ sthāvara-jaṅgamo bhūta-grāmaḥ saṃbhavati \| tasmāt sarvam
āpomayaṃ bhūtaṃ sarvaṃ bhṛgvaṅgiromayam \| antaraite trayo vedā bhṛgūn
aṅgirasaḥ śritā ity ab iti prakṛtir apām oṃkāreṇa ca \| etasmād vyāsaḥ
purovāca:  
“bhṛgvaṅgirovidā saṃskṛto ‘nyān vedān adhīyīta \|  
nānyatra saṃskṛto bhṛgvaṅgiraso ‘dhīyīta \|\|”  
From the waters the families of immotile and motile organisms have come
into being. Hence, all being is imbued with water; \[thus\] all is
imbued with the Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations. The three other Veda-s are
situated within these Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations. Therefore, indeed it
is water and the origin of water is by the Oṃkāra. In this regard Vyāsa
had formerly said:  
“He who is sanctified by the Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras incantations may study the
other Veda-s.  
The one sanctified elsewhere should not study the Veda of the
Bhṛgu-Aṅgiras-es.”

•Regarding the origin of all beings from water: this is articulated
early on in the ṛk: yo apsv ā śucinā daivyena… (RV 2.35.8) of Gṛtsamada
Śaunahotra.

sāmavede ‘tha khilaśrutir brahmacaryeṇa caitasmād atharvāṅgiraso ha yo
veda sa veda sarvam \|  
iti brāhmaṇam \|\|  
Now there is also the khila of the Sāmaveda: “Therefore, he who as a
celibate student knows the Veda of Atharvāṅgiras-es knows all this.”

Thus is the brāhmaṇa.

•The statement from the Sāmaveda-khila is also taken to justify the
punarupanayana that is performed in order for those of other traditions
to study the Atharvaveda.

Notes  
Several notable points are raised by the Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa of the AV,
not just regarding the AV tradition but also regarding its interaction
with the other Vedic schools and their own evolution. It is quite
obvious that the Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa represents a relatively late
brāhmaṇa composition with a specific aim of justifying the primacy of
the AV, probably in the context of the intra-brahminical competition for
the position of the brahman in the śrauta ritual. This is explicitly
supported by the fact that it cites Vyāsa \[Pārāśarya\] who appears in
late Vedic texts and is remembered by tradition as the redactor of the 4
fold form of the śruti. In a similar vein, the citation of the
Sāmaveda-khila suggests that it was composed after the terminal sections
of the Sāmavedic tradition had been completed.

The opening ṛk of the RV is compatible with any of the śakha-s of the
Ṛgveda. The Yajurveda that it refers to is clearly the Vājasaneyi
saṃhitā (either Mādhyaṃdina or the Kāṇva śākhā-s). The Samaveda could
again be any of the Samavedic saṃhitā-s. The Atharvaveda is probably the
Paippalāda saṃhitā because the vulgate and the Śaunakīya begin with “ye
triśaptāḥ…” However, we must note that we do not know the beginning of
the lost AV śākhā-s.

Why is this notable? The AV-pariśiṣṭa 46 (Uttama-paṭala) gives the
beginning and end verses of the four Veda saṃhitā-s along with several
AV verses to be used in the annual Veda-vrata. Notably, these are partly
different from those of the Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa. Interestingly,
according to the Uttama-paṭala, the RV ends with the famous ṛk: “tac
chamyor āvṛṇimahe…”. This is not present in the Śākala-pāṭha which
instead ends with the short Saṃjñā-sūkta. The former ṛk was claimed by
Michael Witzel to be the last ṛk of the Bāṣkala RV. However, as Vishal
Agrawal correctly noted its is stated to be the last ṛk by even the
Śāñkhāyana and Kauśītaki traditions. Thus, the Uttama-paṭala is
referring to some RV śākhā other than Śākala, though we cannot be sure
of its identity.

The Uttama-paṭala gives the Sāmaveda’s first verse as “agna ā yāhi…”,
which is known to be the first ṛk of all surviving śākhā-s of the SV.
However, the last ṛk is given as:  
“eṣa sya te dhārayā suto ‘vyo vārebhir havane maditavyam \| krīḍan
raśmir apārthivaḥ \|\|”  
This is different from the ṛk “svasti na indro vṛddhaśravāḥ…” with which
the surviving SV śākhā-s conclude. It is a divergent variant of the ṛk
RV 9.108.5 not attested elsewhere. In fact the extant SV saṃhitā-s
contain a version that follows the RV cognate. Thus, evidently the
Uttama-paṭala is referring to a now lost SV śākhā.

The situation with the YV is the most interesting. The cited starting
mantra goes thus:  
“iṣe tvorje tvā vāyava sthopāyava stha devo vaḥ savitā prārpayatu
śreṣṭhatamāya karmaṇa āpyāyadhvam aghnyā indrāya bhāgam ūrjasvatīḥ
payasvatīḥ prajāvatīr anamīvā ayakṣmā mā va stena īśata māghaśaṃso
rudrasya hetiḥ pari vo vṛṇaktu dhruvā asmin gopatau syāta bahvīr
yajamānasya paśūn pāhi \|\|”

Remarkably, this mantra is not found in any of the extant YV saṃhitā-s.
However, the “indrāya bhāgam” is reminiscent of the “indrāya
deva-bhāgam” found in the Āpastamba-śrautasūtra and the
Bhāradvāja-śrautasūtra or the “devebhya indrāya” found in the
Maitrāyaṇīya saṃhitā. Moreover, the last mantra of the Yajurveda is
given as “dadhikrāvṇo akāriṣam…”. In other YV saṃhitā-s, this mantra
occurs in the Aśvamedha section and is used among other thing by the
ritualists to purify their mouths after the obscene sexual dialog.
However, it is not the last mantra of the Aśvamedha section in any of
the extant saṃhitā-s. This indicates two things: first, the
Uttama-paṭala is recording a now lost YV śākha of the Kṛṣṇayajurveda
(KYV). Second, while today Āpastamba and Bhāradvāja are attached to the
Taittirīya-śākhā, they were once the sūtra-s of a lost KYV śākhā. This
loss likely happened relatively early. It was probably associated with
the southward movement of the Āpastamba-s and Bhāradvāja-s, who then
shifted to the related Taittirīya-saṃhitā (TS). The text of the
Baudhāyana-śrautasūtra precisely follows the TS; hence, it was
definitely one of the original sūtra-s of the Taittirīya-śākhā.

Finally, the AV of the Uttama-paṭala begins with “ye triśaptāḥ…”
indicating that it was recording the original śākhā behind the vulgate
or the Śaunakīya.

Thus, we see a striking difference between the two AV traditions of the
Gopatha-brāhmaṇa and the Uttama-paṭala. While the tendency is to see the
AV-pariśiṣṭa-s as late and post-dating the brāhmaṇa, we have to be more
cautious. First, the AV-pariśiṣṭa-s are a rather composite mass
recording a range of traditions that with a wide temporal span. Some
material like the Nakṣatra-kalpa-sūkta could closer to the late brāḥmaṇa
material in age whereas, at the other end, the tortoise-soothsaying
(Kurmavibhāga) is likely a late text. We posit that the Uttama-paṭala
belongs to the an early layer of the AV-pariśiṣṭa-s — this provides a
reasonable hypothesis for the divergence between it and the brāhmaṇa.
First, it should be noted that the AV-Paippalāda-AV-Śaunakīya/vulgate
divergence is rather deep — mirroring the deep divergence of the Kṛṣṇa
and Śukla branches of the Yajurveda. This split might have gone along
with some geographical separation in the initial phase of their
divergence. This geographical separation model would suggest that the
Brahmayajña brāhmaṇa tradition was associated with the AV-Paippalāda or
a related lost AV school that was in the vicinity of the old
Vājasaneyin-s. This is also supported by certain parallels seen between
the Gopatha-brāhmaṇa and the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa in the śrauta sections.
In contrast, the Uttama-paṭala as associated with the Śaunakīya or a
related school that developed in the vicinity of a lost KYV śākhā.

We have evidence that the interactions between the KYV and AV traditions
might go back even deeper in time: for example, this is clearly
supported by the AV-related Bhavā-Śarvā-sūkta of the Kaṭha-s that was
likely present in the lost Kaṭha-brahmaṇa and the various shared sūkta-s
and upaniṣat material between the Taittirīya and the AV. Finally, we
have evidence from what is today Gujarat that at a later period there
was a certain equilibriation of the AV schools with the combination of
the Paippalāda and Śaunakīya material. This parallels a similar
acquisition of some Kaṭha material by the Taittirīya. Thus, there
appears to have been a relatively complex web of fission and fusion
interactions between the śākha-s over a protracted period.
