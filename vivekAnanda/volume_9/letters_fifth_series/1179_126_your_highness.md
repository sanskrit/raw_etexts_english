## CXXVI

*To Maharaja Ajit Singh, the Raja of Khetri*

SRINAGAR

*10 August 1898*

YOUR HIGHNESS—

I have long not heard any news of you. How are things going on with you
both bodily and mentally?

I have been to see Shri Amarnathji.[1](#fn1) It was a very enjoyable
trip and the Darshana[2](#fn2) was glorious.

I will be here about a month more, then I return to the plains. Kindly
ask Jagmohan to write to the Dewan Saheb of Kishangarh to get for me the
copies of Nimbârka Bhâshya which he promised.

With all love,

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA
