Pāṇini stands at the pinnacle of Hindu intellectual achievement. His
sūtra-pāṭha may be considered a monument in the same league as the
invention of the śūṇya-based numeral system for which the Hindus are
renowned. However, like several other Hindu figures of note, his life
and times are the subject of divergent or contradictory narratives. To
write about Pāṇini’s times would be in large part merely a rehash of
Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala’s excellent monograph on the topic. Yet, we
present some of the material on this matter (indeed partly just
retelling what VS Agrawala has covered) for it might be of some interest
to those not too well-acquainted with this topic.

A key pre-modern record of Pāṇini by a non-Indian is that given by
Xuanzang, the Chinese scholar and agent of the Tang emperor Taizong. In
his magnum opus, Da Tang Xiyuji, he provides a detailed report of his
journey to and within India, which was presented at the Tang court in
Chang’an before the emperor Taizong in 646 CE. While he was born in an
orthodox Confucian family, Xuanzang became acquainted with bauddha texts
early in his life from his brothers, and decided to study the
bauddha-mata in greater depth. In 626 CE, the 24 year old Xuanzang
became interested in the in depth study of Sanskrit as he was working
through mahāyāna texts and the associated yogacāra literature. After
having acquired a good grasp of the language after three years of study
he had a dream, in which he saw himself being in India. This urged him
to undertake a journey to India and directly study the texts of the
bauddha-mata in their original language. He immediately set off for
India having surreptitiously crossed the Chinese border with the Blue
(Gök)Turk empire. The Khan of the Turks was pleased with his
interaction with Xuanzang and gave his party a feast and assistance to
reach the city of Tashkent and then enter the Iranian territory at
Samarkand. The Iranian lord of Samarkand heard his lecture on mahāyāna
and provided passage to go southwards towards India.

of Śalātura*

Having entered India, he visited the visited the vihāra-s in Bāhlika and
Gandhāra and eventually reached Śalātura, which is today the village of
Chota Lahore in the terrorist state of Pakistan (on the North-west bank
of the Sindhu river, moving north from Attock). Xuanzang wrote in his Da
Tang Xiyuji: “To the north-west of U-to-kia-han-c’ho at a distance of 20
li or so we come to the town of So-ls-tu-lo (i.e. Śalātura). This is the
place where the ṛṣi Pāṇini, who composed the Ching-ming-lun (the
Aṣṭādhyāyi) was born… The children of this town, who are his
disciples, revere his eminent qualities, and a statue erected to his
memory still exists.” Evidently this statue of Pāṇini has been destroyed
by the Moslems who have since occupied those regions. However, the
village Chota Lahore apparently has several elevated mounds
corresponding to the ruins of the ancient town of Śalātura, which were
briefly explored by a Belgian woman named Corbeau close the middle of
the last century; many Gandharan artifacts from there have apparently
been looted and sold to western markets the Pakistanis. The monumental
effort of Pāṇini is sometimes referred to in Hindu tradition as the
Śālāturīya-matam after this now ruined town. Indeed, this is a stark
reminder of how a site so important to the Hindu tradition, a center
from which a monument of human thought emerged, can be so completely
erased by the barbarism of the third Abrahamism – a fate that can
overtake the whole of Jaṃbudvīpa.

Then the Da Tang Xiyuji records an interesting tradition regarding the
life of Pāṇini:  
“Referring to the most ancient times, letters were very numerous; but
when in the process of ages, the world was destroyed and remained as a
void, the Deva-s of long life descended spiritually to guide the people.
Such was the origin of the ancient letters and composition. From this
time and after it the source (i.e. the root language) spread and passed
its (former) bounds. Brahma-deva and Śakra-deva established rules
according to requirements. Ṛṣi-s belonging to different schools each
drew up forms of letters. Men in their successive generations put into
use what had been delivered to them; but nevertheless students without
ability were unable to make use (of these teachings). And now men’s
lives were reduced to the length of a hundred years, when ṛṣi Pāṇini was
born; he was from birth extensively informed about things. The times
being dull and careless, he wished to reform the vague and false rules –
to fix the rules and correct improprieties (of usage). As he wandered
about asking for the right ways, he encountered Īśvara-deva and
recounted to him the plan of his undertaking. Īśvara-deva said,
“Wonderful\! I will assist you in this.” The ṛṣi, having received
instruction, retired. He then labored incessantly and put forth all his
power of mind. He collected a multitude of words (i.e. the Gaṇa-pāṭha),
and made a book on letters which contained a thousand śloka-s; each
śloka was of 32 syllables. It contained everything known from the first
till then, without exception, respecting letters and words. He then
closed it and sent it to the supreme ruler, who exceedingly prized it,
and issued an edict that throughout the kingdom it should be used and
taught to others; and he added that whoever should learn it from
beginning to end should receive as his reward a thousand pieces of gold.
And so from that time masters have received it and handed it down in its
completeness for the good of the world. Hence, the brāhmaṇa-s of this
town are well-grounded in their literary work, and are of high renown
for their talents, well-informed as to things, and of a vigorous
understanding.”

VS Agrawala discusses this account in detail, and, in our opinion,
correctly indicates that Xuanzang is recording a real Hindu tradition.
As for the Aṣṭādhyāyi being in thousand śloka-s rather than the
sūtra-pāṭha as we have it many divergent views are offered; however,
Agrawala supports the view that it was merely an approximation of the
actual number of syllables in the sūtra-pāṭha, which add up to
approximately 32,000. Further, Agrawala holds the view that the
presentation of the Aṣṭādhyāyi to the supreme ruler of India (Cīna term:
da wang) is related to by an account given by learned Rājpūt author
Rājaśekhara in the Pratihāra court (\~late 800s-900s of CE):  
śrūyate ca pāṭaliputre śāstrakāra-parīkṣā:  
atropavarṣa-varṣav iha pāṇini-piṅgalāv iha vyāḍiḥ |  
vararuci pataṅjalī iha parīkṣitāḥ khyātim upajagmuḥ ||

One hears that in Pāṭaliputra (modern Patna) there was an examination of
the authors of technical works: It was here that Upavarṣa, Varṣa,
Pāṇini, Piṅgala, Vyāḍi, Vararuci and Pataṅjalin were tested and
thereby attained fame.

That Rājaśekhara was recording an ancient tradition becomes evident from
the Greek philosopher Strabo(\~64 BC–24 CE)’s account of the court of
Pāṭaliputra (Book 15.1, section 39):

“…the population of India is divided into seven castes: the one first in
honor, but the fewest in number, consists of the philosophers (the
Brachmanes); and these philosophers are used, each individually, by the
people making sacrifice to the gods or making offerings to the dead, but
jointly by the kings at the Great Synod (mahāsabhā at Pāṭaliputra), as
it is called, at which, at the beginning of the new year, the
philosophers, one and all, come together at the gates of the king; and
whatever each man has drawn up in writing or observed as useful with
reference to the prosperity of either fruits or living beings or
concerning the government, he brings forward in public; and he who is
thrice found false is required by law to keep silence for life, whereas
he who has proved correct is adjudged exempt from tribute and taxes.”  
Hence, it is indeed likely that Pāṇini had presented his work at such a
mahāsabhā at the capital of the Magadhan empire and it was accepted by
it. This was probably a long-standing practice in the region going back
to the Mithilan court where the Janaka-s held such sabhā-s (described in
the brāhmaṇa literature) and eventually shifted to Pāṭaliputra with rise
of the Magadhan power.

This leads us to another Hindu tradition regarding Pāṇini: In the
Bṛhatkathā tradition, the scholars Upavarṣa, Varṣa, Pāṇini, Piṅgala,
Vyāḍi, Vararuci are all linked together by a web of connections. While
at Pāṭaliputra, Vararuci and Vyāḍi are said to have been students of
Varṣa. Then Vararuci was enamored by the beauty of Varṣa’s niece,
Upakośā, the daughter of Upavarṣa, and wooed her till Upavarṣa acceded
to marry her to Vararuci. After Vararuci and Vyāḍi graduated, Varṣa got
Pāṇini as a student from the northwest, whom Vararuci described as being
an idiot. Pāṇini learned little, and one day Varṣa’s wife being
frustrated with him threw him out. The dejected Pāṇini is then said to
have gone to the Himālaya to worship the god Rudra with austerities.
Finally, please with Pāṇini, Rudra gave him a new grammar of the
Sanskrit language. Armed with this Pāṇini is said to have returned to
Pāṭaliputra and challenged Vararuci in the sabhā. Their debate raged
for seven days and Vararuci felt he was close to defeating Pāṇini. But
then on the eight day Rudra made a terrible noise from the skies and the
Aindra grammar, which was taught in the days of the Veda by Indra, in
which Vararuci was an expert, was erased. With that Pāṇini emerged the
victor. Utterly dejected by this, Vararuci is then said to have left his
wife with his mother, deposited his wealth with a Vaiśya, and gone to
the Himālaya to propitiate Rudra. In the mean time his wife Upakośā is
said to have been violently harried by the Vaiśya and other men seeking
to have extra-marital affairs with her. However, she tricked them by
inviting them to her house and capturing them in a box and had them
conveyed to emperor Nanda’s court. Nanda then arrested them and exiled
them. In the meantime, Vararuci succeeded in pleasing Rudra and returned
upon receiving the same grammar as Pāṇini. He was elated to hear how his
wife had outwitted the rival males and now lived a contended life with
his newly acquired grammatical knowledge. His former teacher Varṣa too
now expressed the wish to acquire the same grammar. He worshiped the god
Kumāra who then gave him the same grammar.

This narrative is contrasts that of Xuanzang. There, Pāṇini is a great
genius, who is said to have been informed of all things right from his
birth. In that narrative Rudra’s teaching is only the start of a process
of intense mental effort on part of Pāṇini. This is also consistent with
the tradition that while Pāṇini obtained the Māheśvara sūtrāṇi from
Rudra, the rest of the exposition was his own effort. Indeed, Xuanzang’s
story is more in line with the tradition of the Pāṇinīya-s who
acknowledge that Pāṇini was a supreme scholar. As Agrawala points out
the Kāśika commentary on Pāṇini plainly states:

mahatī sūkṣmekṣikā vartate sūtrakārasya |  
The sūtrakāra (i.e. Pāṇini)’s insight is profound and subtle.

However, the narrative of the Bṛhatkathā tradition attempts to
consistently put down Pāṇini:  
1\) It suggests that Pāṇini was a sluggard who got his grammar purely
due to divine intervention.  
2\) It further makes the point that even with the superior grammar he
was unable to defeat Vararuci, the foremost proponent of the Aindra
school of grammar – even here his victory was solely due to Rudra’s
aggressive intervention on his behalf.  
3\) It then suggests that, although Vararuci and Varṣa eventually
switched to the Pāṇinīya school, they did not acquire it from Pāṇini.
Rather, they independently obtained it respectively from Rudra and
Kumāra.

This suggests that the older Aindra school, while beaten, only
grudgingly accepted the defeat. Their chief proponent Vararuci seems to
have pushed his own story, where Pāṇini is not only put down but his
role is also minimized – he played no part in their eventual acceptance
of the Pāṇinīya system; rather, they all obtained the same grammar
independently from the gods by themselves. This is keeping with the
evidence that that the Aindra school was once influential, and would not
have easily bowed out to Pāṇini’s despite its apparent superiority. It
seems to have lingered on in the peripheral zones. In the Dramiḍa
country, it was the Aindra grammar that was used as the model for the
analysis of a language from a totally different family, Tamiḻ (a
Dravidian language), resulting in its early grammar, the Tolkāppiyam. A
preface appended to that work states:

vaṭa vēṅkaṭam teṉ kumari  
āyiṭait  
tamiḻ kūṟum nal ulakattu  
vaḻakkum ceyyuḷum āyiru mutaliṉ  
eḻuttum collum poruḷum nāṭic 5

Vēṅkaṭam \[Tirupati hills\] in the north, Kumari (Southern tip of
peninsula) in south,  
where Tamiḻ is spoken in the good world,  
common and poetic usage, beginning with these two,  
analyzing syllables, words, and meanings,  
with the topic closely related to chaste Tamil,  
seeing the foremost text, devising it to be in proper form,  
a faultless discourse, he strung together  
in the assembly of the Pāṇṭiyaṉ monarch Nilamtaru Tiruviṉ,  
with his tongue the shore of dharma \[ocean\], knowledgeable in \[all\]
4 Veda-s,  
Ataṅkōṭṭu ācārya examined and corrected errors,  
showing as per un-deluded tradition the formulation of syllables,  
full of the Aindra \[grammar\] like the ocean of water,  
presenting his name as Tolkāppiyaṉ,  
He is the standard (Skt: prathimā) established in great fame.  
(Translation done with the help of a relative familiar with classical
Tamiḻ usage)

There are some interesting features concerning this narrative regarding
the Tolkāppiyam: First, it is said to have been presented at the
Pāṇṭiyaṉ court in a manner similar to what is said of the
Pāṇinīya grammar at the Magadhan court. Second, this act of
presentation in the court, and it is apparent subsequent acceptance,
seems to have been the basis of it being established as a standard. This
again parallels the case of Pāṇini. Finally, it is of considerable
significance to note that Tolkāppiyaṉ is said to have studied the
colloquial and poetic usage of Tamiḻ throughout the Dramiḍa country,
from Tirupati to Kanyakumari and analyzed it thoroughly to generate his
grammar. This is an exact parallel of Pāṇini’s creation of the famed
Gaṇa-pāṭha, which stands as one of the remarkable ethnological,
geographical and linguistic explorations in the history of science.
Pāṇini gathered comparable data from the greater Indo-Aryan realm
from Prakaṇva (the Ferghana region of the modern Uzbek-Kyrgyz zone) to
Kaliṅga (Odisha) and Sūramasa (Assam). This suggests that as the big
Tamil kingdoms arose, several models, already perfected in the North,
were transplanted to the southern courts, sparking similar endeavors in
the Pāṇṭiyaṉ realm. The fact that an Aindra grammarian carried out a
comparable exercise as Pāṇini in South India suggests that this method
had already been imbibed by the rival school or perhaps both Pāṇini and
Tolkāppiyaṉ inherited this methodological framework from the original
Aindra tradition.

This finally leads us to the thorny question of the date of Pāṇini.
Given that the Bṛhatkathā tradition places him as a contemporary of the
first Nanda, one might say that he lived around 350 BCE. This tradition
is also supported by the bauddha kriyā tantra, the
Ma\~njuśrīya-mūlakalpa, where Pāṇini is described as a good friend of
\[Mahāpadma\]-nanda. Most white indologists, who generally favor late
dates for all Hindu texts, also not surprisingly find such a date
appealing. Further, it is suggested that this also brings him
comfortably close to the date of his second great commentator Pataṅjalī
(first being Kātyāyana) who is placed in the Śuṅga court. However,
despite the existence of such a tradition, we recommend caution in
ascribing such a late date to Pāṇini. The political geographical
tradition that he records is clearly more consistent with several
smaller ekarāja monarchies and saṃgha republics belonging to a period
prior to the rise of the large Magadhan empire of the Nanda-s. We might
also note in this regard that there is tendency in kāvya literature to
“telescope” history by combining characters of different eras into a
single historical layer. We see this even in the later Gupta court,
where Bhartṛhari, Varāhamihira, Śabara-svāmin and Kālidāsa are all
stated as existing side-by-side in Vikramāditya’s court. Hence, we
cannot uncritically accept Pāṇini as a member of the Nanda court.
Nevertheless, we believe that tradition is correctly recording the role
of the Magadhan scholarly assembly in peer-reviewing and accepting
Pāṇini’s monumental work.
