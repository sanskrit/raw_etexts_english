PREFACE 


This essay, in its original form, was published at 
Calcutta during the last year (I 860 ), It consists 
of two volumes, in the Hind! language, and 
is entitled Shad-dariana-d&rpana, and ' Hindu 
Philosophy examined by a Benares Pandit’. 
Scarcely a page of those volumes, however, is 
here reproduced without much change. To say 
nothing of less important alterations, whole 
chapters have been retrenched, and others have 
been inserted. Thu notes, throughout, are new. 
These, equally with the text, are the work of 
Pandit Usflakanfha; a very few excepted, which 
the nature of their contents will suffice to 
distinguish. 

The Shail -dariana-darpanit was addressed to 
,i Section of the author’s countrymen. But the 
pride of the native literati forbids them to have 
dealings with their vernacular beyond the narrow 
range of social occasions. Moreover, the techni- 
calities of philosophy, among the Hindus, are as 
yet drawn solely from the Sanskrit. Only a

Till 

meagre number of those technicalities are popu 
larly employed ; and, of such as are thus employed, 
not one in ten is fully comprehended by the 
vulgar. This being the 4 the author, as might 
have been anticipated, discovered, that his Hindi 
labours had been to little purpose. A- for this 
translation, it was undertaken, at the instance of 
an estimable missionary, mainly tor the use of 
his fellow-evangelizers, and of Hindu student * 
of English who may wFh to acquaint themselves 
with the absfcruser matters of their ancestral 
religion, 

A familiarity with the sketches of Hindu philos- 
ophy drawn up by Colebruoke, will be found 
well-nigh indispensable as a preparation for under- 
standing what is heie presented to 'tin* lvuuei 
Later writers m the same department will, as 
a rule, he much more likely to mislead than 
to render am solid assistance. From this «u na- 
ture a resen ation must, however, be made in 
favour of the Reverend Professor Ranerjeu. whose 
Dialogues an the Hindu Philosophy 1 aiv a mine, 
of new and authentic indications. What from 
the elucidations of that learned gentleman, and 
those of Pandit NTlakantha, it should -eem, that, 
in order really to penetrate the m\ Meries of 
Hinduism, we could scarcely do better than

There are scores of terms, belonging to the 
nomenclature of Hindu philosophy, precise equiva- 
lents of which have not yet been wrought out 
for us with the help of the Latin and Greek. 
Of the terms in question there are not a few 
which the translator of these pages has boon the 
first kf dress in a European garb ; and, that he 
has had other than moderate success, is more 
than he can venture to suppose. Colebrooke and 
his successors have, indeed, elaborated many close 
and felicitous renderings. Still, they have left 
much unattempted, and something to be amended. 
Had the translator departed from "nature', as 
representing 'prakriti? he would hardh have done 
amiss. Again , 4 modification ’ conveys a \ery much

improvements were thought of when, unfortu- 
nately, it was too late, save at the risk of entailing 
confusion, to introduce them . 5 

A glossary has been omitted solely from want 
of leisure to prepare one. In fact, the necessity 
which lay upon the translator, of executing his 
task against time, if he executed it at ail, should 
excuse many of the defects which will be seen 
to mark his performance. Pandit Kllakantha’s 
disquisitions were certainly well worthy of being

etc. See the fourth note at p. 257. It was Culebrooke, Professor 
Wilson, and others who herein set the example which the 
translator for a while unadvPedlv followed.

to express himself. At p. J120, 1. 5 ‘soul’ occurs twice, where 

4 spirit* is intended. In the ninth line of the nett page* in 

place of ‘Isvara, no less than the soul,* read ‘Isvara no less 
than every other individuated spirit. 1 A few more similar 
mistakes, the result of unavoidable haste, are noted at tin* end 
of the volume.

PREFATORY NOTE 

Kxpl \natioxs op some Technical Terms 

The Minor of the Hindu Phi’oso}>hie<d Systems was 
translated by Dr, Fitz-Edward Hall iroin the Hindi. 
The author, in a Paper on ‘ The Hindu Philo- 
sophies \ iu the Indian Church Quarterly Review, for 
April, 1^)1, states that the technical terms of Hindu 
Philosophy are not always correctly rendered in 
English Borne of the principal, as explained in the 
above Paper, are therefore given below: 

‘ An atom (pammdnu) is the minutest portion of 
earth, water, etc,; it is invisible, intangible, in short, 
inappreciable by any of the senses; and it is in- 
capable ol further division, There is no word for 
Ahisd in English. The word “ ether ”, by which it is 
sometimes translated, is misleading. It is like space 
in every respect except this, that it is imagined to be 
the material cause of sound. Manna is translated by 
English authors by “ mind But mmas is not mind. 
It is a material internal organ. Aktlsa, bib (time) 
and mi mas are believed to be substances (dravya). 

It is the custom of English authors to translate 
ftaknii by u Nature”. Prakriti is composed of three 
material substances, called saliva, rajas , anti tamas ; 
these words are translated by English authors, “ good- 
ness 1 ’, “ passion ”, and “ darkness ” respectively. Who 
will suppose that goodness, passion and darkness are 
material substances out of which the whole material 
universe is evolved ? 1

PREFATORY NOTE 


< Sattrn, rajas , and tamas , in the ftiiukhw s\ sfrin, 
are so called not because they are then Helves fond- 
ness, passion, and darkness, but from the' effects 
which they are supposed to produce. The < tfeets of 
saliva are good; such as clearness of iindm standing, 
calmness, peace, etc. The effects of rajas are pm-inn, 
attachment to the world and its pleasures. Tin* 
effects of tamas are stupidity, I have Intruded some 
speculations that, by such words as prnkntt, siittw, 
rajas , tamas , buddhi (intellect), uhinkara (sdf -con- 
sciousness), etc., different things were original!) under- 
stood, the very tilings which those terms signify, but 
gradually their meaning was changed, and the authors 
have come to understand by them quite dilYoivnt 
things. See Mirror of the Hindu Philosophical Systems, 

p. 112. 

* As the Sankhyas say that the universe is evolved 
from prakriti, so the Vediintists say that it is evolved 
from mly&, or ajnmu, that is ignorance. Maya 
(illusion) or ignorance is the material cause of the 
universe. Like pralmti , it is composed of sattva, raja*, 
and tamas , 

The Sankhya and the Vedanta teach that appre- 
hension, will, activity, pleasure, pain, etc., are not 1 
qualities of the soul, but are orittis of the antah* 
bar ana, and they are only reflected in the soul Vritti 
is an affection of the antahkarana , which is evolved 
from it, and is a modification (parhuma) of if ; just 
as the antahkarana itself is evolved from pmkriti apd 
is a modification of it, Now they say that the* anmh 
katana is the internal organ as its name signifies.*

in the present tieati %\ 

1 ithpo-k, in this book, to discuss succinctly the six 
Philosophical Systems (Davsarus) of the Hindus. The 
fuulanumtal authorities of the Hindu religion are the 
Vedas, the SmritLv the Purunas, etc. , not the Systems. 
Of then 1 * * 4 the staple is argument. But they profess 
to dm he their views fiom the Veda and ofciter sacred 
hooks. Independent authority as to those views they 
disclaim. Hence it might be supposed that, in examin- 
ing the Hindu religion, a discussion of the Systems

4 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

would be quite unnecessary . Such dDci.wun h.n, 
however, these advantages: — 

1. The sis Systems are not held by the Hindus 
to be the work of ordinary men, but of RishU; 1 2 and 
they tire adjudged eqtul m rank with the SmrnLs, 
the Puranas, etc,, which are reputed to have a Hmiku 
authorship. If then, on investigation, error* are 
proved to exist in the fornur, doubt must attach to 
the credit of the latter. When it h Hiown Unit the 
very Rishis are wrong, and made gross mistakes in 
writings by which they undertake to communicate to 
the world the knowledge of truth anil the means ot 
salvation, who can esteem any statement deserving of 
confidence, simply because it emanated from a Rishi ? 

2. Though vulgar Hindus are indillmeut to, and 
unacquainted with, the dogmas established in the 
Systems yet those dogmas are highly Considered by 
the learned. To them those dogmas, concerning God, 
the world, its origin, the soul A its bondage, emanci- 
pation, and so on, arc as it wviv the root and life 
of the Hindu religion; while the narratives, and tales, 
and ritual matters of the Vedas, Hmritis, Puranas, ate. 
may be viewed as its branches. To the learned ho 
excellent do those doctrines appear, and so fully uc- 

1 Primarily, in the Hindu mythology, Bight .dgnitu k a holy 
sago to whom some portion of the Veda U said to have been 
revealed. In a vague sense, the word denotes an expired 
man. 

2 Throughout these pages, ‘ souP is used, in an aecomfau- 
dated sense, to translate jiva ; a term not applied to Brahma 
and Isvara, while it is employed of men, gods, and all other 
persons. As these have souls, go, it is thought, have ail things 
animal and vegetable. 



THE FSES OF AN EXAMINATION

mordant with reason, that they cling to them with 
the strongest affection, and the cord of this affection 
holds them fast to the Hindu faith. It is, therefore, 
my firm conviction, that if they saw those doctrines 
to he faulty, and discarded them, they would be led 
to lose ail regard for Hinduism. And such a result 
would, with hod’s blessing, attend candid inquiry. 

d There is no question that the authors of the 
S\ stems, and their groat expositors, were, in their 
way, most intelligent and learned men, anti acute in- 
vestigators. Hut, since, in spite of all the energy they 
threw into their search after truth they fell mto serious 
errors, it is evident how extremely difficult it is for 
men to arrive, by their own wisdom, at the true know- 
ledge of Hod. Add to this, that sages, as in India, 
so m all other countries, have herein failed. Hence, 
that System; it is established, is divine, which pro- 
pound* com cot views of God and of His right path. 

My prayer is, that God may have mercy upon you. 
Relinquishing partiality, and with a desire for the sal- 
vation of jour souls, as you would r<\ich the right 
path, mil) you ponder what I am ahum to set forth. 

The six Systems are the Nyfna, Vuisesluka, Sankhya, 
Yoga, Mlmanisfi, anti Vedanta They are also called 
the six Sasfras.' Tin* Sankhya and the Yoga agree in 
all essentials; save that the funnel does not acknow- 
ledge God, while the latter does. Hence, occasion- 
ally, in Hindu books, both are denominated Sankhya ; 
tilts one atheistic, and the other theisfcie. In many 

* By UiK word, in it* wider acceptation, m denoted a body 
of teaching, revealed, or of human origin, concerned with any 
subject whatsoever. 



6 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYST1IM> 

places, also, the Mlmanisa is styled the prior >Tiiu<iiu->u, 
and the Vedanta, the latter MTmrtmsCi. 1 The reason 
of this is, that they are alike concerned with discuss- 
ing statements of the Veda. The prior MimJinma 
pertains to its ritual section; and the latter Mhn.nusa, 
to its scientific section. This section, being at the 
end (ant a) of the Veda, k named Ved mta. Thousands 
of authors, from remote antiquit) down to recent 
times, have written treatises on the six Systems, 
Among these are some known l»y the name of Sutras, 
or Aphorisms, which are reckoned Urn bask of all the 
rest, and are referred, by the Hindus, to Hishk Thus, 
the Nyaya is ascribed to Gotuma, or Akslmpada ; the 
Vaiseshika, to Kanada, .or Kanahhaksha ; the Sinkhyu, 
to Kapila; the Yoga, to Patanjali; the Minumsri, to 
Jaimini ; and the Vedanta, to Batlarayatm, 

The plan which I have resolved upon Jor criticizing 
the six Systems is this : In the First place I hball 
exhibit those doctrines which, with slight deductions, 
are common to all the Systems ; and then those dis- 
tinctive doctrines of all the Systems, save the Vedanta, 
which are especially worthy of examination. In the 
third section I shall canvass the characteristic doctrines 
of the Vedanta. The distinctive tenets of the other, 
five Systems I shall deal with in this wise, I have 
remarked above that the Sankhya and the Yoga 
consent in all important respects but one. On ‘the 
ground of this general unanimity, I shall treat of their 
doctrines together. Then I shall speak of one or two 
articles of the Mimamsa which are deserving of alien- 


1 Tfitva Mlmiimsa and Uttara Ml mtasi. 



THE SIX SYSTEMS

lion. As for the N t \d\a and the Yaiseshika, the learned 
recognize a close aihnit} between them. They concede 
that, for the most part, nothing found in the* one 
is repugnant to an} tiling occurring in the other, and 
that, in fact, the} supplement each other . 1 Indeed, 
Hindus who nowadays write on the Nyaya, combine 
the Yaiseshika with it/ The discrepant opinions of 
these two Systems I shall pass by unnoticed. Their 
other opinions l shall take account of conjointly. An 


* The seven Yaise-hika predicaments are thus spoken of by 
VuU.m.Uha PanehSnaiu Hhatttehdrya: ^ qj*pqf 

l NMdh&nta-imil'taraH on 

the fir?-! couplet of the IihaM~parkhchhfdn ‘And these cate, 
gorien are well known in the VaKeshika, and are not opposed 
to the vines of the Naiy.iyikas.’ 

wwiN fsr^r r 

‘The Tarkci’&mgraha, to. Tract on the Categories, was 
composed by the learned Annam Bh&tta, with a view to render- 
ing the uninstructed proficient in the doctrines of Karachi and 
of the Nya\a.‘ 

Thus end- the Tarka-mngraha, a Nyaya manual. The couplet 
has been translated in accordance? with Annam Bh&tfcifs expla- 
nation of it in h'n Tarl'ndifiH , 

Such hook- as that just cited, the MuktdvaH, and many 
more might fairly -in respect of their subject-matter, and of 
tit* fart that they ignore the Nyaya aphorisms— be entitled 
to the appellation of YaUcshika treatises, were it not that, 
on topics where the NyiUa and the Yaiseshika deviate, as 
concerning the kinds of proof, the doctrines of the former are 
strenuously maintained as against those of the latter. 



vS THE HINDI’ FHILOSOPHiCAE SYSTEMS 

examination of all the Systems will then m 

the manner about to be stated. 

Many and voluminous are the hooks eoncuntni \uth 
the six Systems; and they handle a large \.uirtv of. 
topics. I do not by any means undertake to pass 
all these topics under review, hut only such as u*v 
most considerable. Many of them are common ?o all 
the Systems ; while as to some I he Systems flitter 
among themselves very seriously. Hence, if we in* liti- 
gate any one System thoroughly, our deeUitms will 
affect no small portion of the others. To me tin* 
Nyaya and the Vaiseshika seem most reasonable of 
all. Not to mention their claims to preference on 
other accounts, they acknowledge a God, eternal and 
omnipotent; and so are superior to the Han kb) a, and 
to the Mimamsa, which deny (tod ; and to the Vedanta 
as well, which identifies souls with Brahma, i shall 
therefore apply a searching scrutiny to the whole of 
the leading opinions of the Nyaya and Vaistr&hika. 
First of all, however, I shall dispose of a few peculiar 
doctrines of the Sankhya and Mimfnnsft, which call 
for observation. As was before said, those dogmas 
of the Yoga, in respect of which It deviates from the 
Nyaya and Vaiseshika, will be included in treating of* 
the Sankhya; and I shall dilate on the specialities of 
the Vedanta in the last section of the volume. 

It should be borne in mind that, in this work, 
I shall present the tenets of the Nyaya and Vaiseshika, 
not simply as they are expressed in the aphorisms, 
but as they have been developed by authors of 
a later date, both ancient and modern. For, though 
the Hindus think otherwise, I suspect a difference

10 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

one of the Nyaja aphorisms do we find God so much 
as named; and it does not imluhitahly appear from 
that, that the author of the aphorisms believed in Him. 
In that place, God is declared to he the maker of the 
world. But it should he known, that the writer of 
the Xyffya-s it Ira -v ri tti offers two interpretations <>{ 
the aphorism referred to, and of the two that, succeed 
it. According to the first of those interpretations, the 
first of the three aphorisms does not enunciate the 
view of the author, but is given as the view of an 
opponent; and the ‘two ensuing aphorisms are for the 
purpose of refuting it. The expositor, however, under 
stands that his author did not intend to deny the 
divine origination of the world, hut only to assert that 
God cannot he the maker of the world, independently 
of the works of souls. At the same time, the expositor 
states that, by some, the purport of the three aphorisms 
is taken otherwise, that is to say, as designed to 
establish God’s existence . 1 In a matter so besot with 
doubt, it is difficult to arrive at certainty. 

1 The three aphorisms referred to will here be givvn, \utbr 
the drift of the commentator’s remarks. 

The first is: fq*; ‘One! 

■ 

is the cause, since the works of souls ftntrmha) art* found to be 
ineffectual,’ 

This, in the first place, is assumed to bo asserted by. an 
opponent who rejects the dogma- taken for granted, by tlio 
commentator, to bo held by Gofcama— that God and the work* 
of souls are, in concert, the cause of the universe. On one 
supposition, the opponent is, to all appearance, a YedAntin, 
whose meaning is, ‘God is the sole cause,* i. e, agreeably to one 
Vedanta view, ‘sole and material cause’ of the universe, and* 
agreeably to another view, undoubtedly Vedantic, its* note and 



THE YAISESIIIKA APHORISMS 11 

And, itgirin, the* name of God nowhere shows itself 
in the Yaiseshika Aphorisms. In a few of them there 


illuntuy -material cause.* By ‘pole 1 cause is meant 1 irrespectively 
of the works t if souls', * Ineffectual 1 ; wz. cm some occasion-. 

* The- work- of <-ouB arc found to he ’so. Hence, they are not 
to ho accounted a cause. 

But it i- to a second interpretation that the commentator 
evhhnfh accord- his preference. This- interpretation suppose- 
an *r»bje» tor to urge dimply, that God alone, since the work- 
of soul- an* ineffectual, is the author of the universe, indepen- 
dent]) of ,-ueh works. 

(iuUmn replies: q 1 ‘Not 

O 

so ; since, m default of the work- of soul-, there i- no pro- 
duction of effects.’ 

Tn explication, the commentator argues, resisting the Veddntm, 
that inasmuch as Hod, in his system, is devoid of volition if 
He alone were the cause of the universe, everything would be pro- 
duced at all times, and he uniform in character. The works 
of soul- must, by consequence, be conjoined with God, in order 
to an origination of the universe. 

Anticipating the objection, that, if such weight be attached, 
as in the last aphorism, to the works of souls, resort must be 
had to the fiction, that the efforts of souls never miss of their 

end, tie* Ki-lri pronounces: cfcqfiflTci^F^^ff J l ‘ The efforts 

so 

«»/ muh are, at times , no cause of effects , because the imn-pw - 
ductum theieaf is caused by that default of works.* That is to 
any, when a man, for instance, is unsuccessful, his failure is 
due to want of merit, 

, In conclusion, the commentator informs us that the con- 
struction of the aphorisms, adopted by some, is as follows 
Goiaraa’h purpose is to esUhli-h God's existence. He begins 
An laying down that God is author of the universe ; and he repels 
the notion that souls can bo so ; as they sometimes full of 
bringing their efforts to bear, and thus prove thomsches to fall 
abort of omniscience. A MfmArnsaka antagonist rejoins, in the 
second aphorism, that it is not so. But for the works of souls.

See the A ydiiasittta-vritti , pp. 17h-7; Book iv, apln ri-ins I'd,

i The third aphorism, for one, is as follows ; 

HISF^ | Sankara Ivlisra says of this: 

^FRlfe I ‘The Utd refers to God,— though Hu 

is not previously mentioned --because of His being well. known.* 
According to this comment the aphorism signifies : * The Veda 
is authoritative, as being God’s declaration.’ But Sankara, um 
<*ertain whether his first exposition be tenable, gives, us a 

second : q£r clfefcT wh qilPRlfa I M>r. the 

tad refers to “virtue”; because juxtaposed.’ In this ea»«% the 
meaning is, that the Veda has authority, hy reason that it 
treats of virtue. Dharma , ‘virtue’, is the last word of the 
preceding aphorism, the second. VaiM&hika-su ttopasto rn, MS,

1 Prahhdlam and the Tdilala argue that ignorance is ^cml, 
on flit 1 *grutmd of the scripture . “The other, the inner soul 
consisting ot bliss”, and so forth; and because we observe 
intellect and the rest to merge in ignorance and because of the 
notion*, “ I am ignmant ”, “I possess consciousness ”, etc. As for 
the Hhdttn, he asserts that ignm anee-enveloped intelligence is

knowledge alone, and i* bhas itself”, and so on , and because, 
in deep sleep, there art* both the light of knowledge and the 
darkness of ignorance , and because of the notions “ Myself 
1 know not”, etc, Anothei Bauddha, one additional to several 
before summoned, holds that nihility is the soul, by reason 
of the scripture: “In the beginning this was a mere nonentity”, 
and s<> hath; and because, in deep sleep, there is the negation 
of iverytbmg; and because, m a man who has waked, rtf the 
consciousness which has for its object the memory of his non- 
existence, the memory; “In deep sleep I was not”. 1 

This is not the place to detail minutely the nnpeit of 
.ignorance, as used in the last extract. A full treatment of the 
subject will he seen m the third Section. 

Among the ignorances, the causes of bondage, K according to 
the KAnkhya, the soul’s identifying itself with nature, and, 
according to the Vedanta, its identifying itself with ignorance, 
etc., etc., as already noted. But who is ever conscious of com- 
mitting a mistake of this sort? In fact, these hindrances to 
.liberation are rarely instanced as .samples of misapprehension. 
What is meant by the soul’s identification of itself with the 
body, and with intellect, can be understood ; for, as stoutness 
and leanness are properties of the Indy, so, in the Sankhya and 
WdAnta, desire, aversion, etc,, are properties of the mind. 
After this explanation, we see at once what is intended by the

amasses virtue, as it is called, which is the source of benefit. This 
virtue is of two kinds ; accompanied by knowledge, and unaccom-

of Progenitors, and the like. The former luo. for its fruit the 
attainment of the Abode of the gods, as one limit, and the Abode 
of Brahma, a* the ‘other. And thus says the scripture: “ The 
worshipper of the Supreme spirit is to be preferred, not the 
worshipper of the gods ”, etc. The Smriti also declares : “ Works 
ordained by the Veda arc of two kinds'’, etc. Further, when 
virtue ami sin equilibrate, one inherits humanity. Thus is the 
course of transmigration-- beginning with Brahma, and ending 
with things fixed, as trees, and occasioned by virtue and sin- -with 
him who has the defects of natural nescience and such like.’

Hindus express themselves, it is like the toil which a man goes 
through in cooking his dinner.

So much for one theory touching the effect of in< umhent good 
works. Another, and one more accordant with the u uai drain of 
the sacred hooks, is as follows. In this theory, incumbent good 
works have all the virtue ascribed to them in the other, ami, over 
and beyond, have for requital what is there denied them. Truth 
to tell, it is very latitudinarian exegesis that treats as eulogistic

Worship at the turns of the day, that is morning, noon, and

difficulty is in this, that, though, from having entered 
upon an ascetic course, a man is dispensed from con- 
stant and occasional works, still there are many things 
which, in his own despite, derive merit to him Bach 
is contact* with the water of the Ganges; the merit 
-communicated by which he reaps, whether he will or 
not. 1 To free onesell from the fetters of both virtue 
and vice, right apprehension is the sole remedy. 

Things being so, the Systems declare that release 
from transmigration, and ail that it entails, can be 
achieved only by acquiring right apprehension. 2 And 

*H«Tt ! ‘And the

tions, is 1 ho gaming the Abode of Progenitor* and the Abode of

Sankara Ach.trya is of the same mi ml, as may be seen m the 
note at p. 17. He there speak* of two sort* of good works, each of 
which earns home supernal residence. And it appears, from the 
language of his commentator, that constant good works are therein 
embraced , for he say,', that the ‘ worshipper of the spirit*, is one 
who engages m such works. 

In this second theory, then, incumbent good works, no kvs than 
voluntary, are a cause of bondage.

Furthermore, they all hold that tho soul is strain 
and again invested with a corporeal form. Death and 
birth have, for every soul, always existed. When 
the soul of a man takes on ihe body of a beast, it 
becomes a beast; and, when the soul of a beast takes 
on the body of a man, it becomes a man. The soul 
may soar to become a divinity ; and it may descend 
to inform a tree. 1 

Another opinion 2 common to all the Systems is, 

i A late miseellamst, more celebrated for versatility and self- 
confidence than for exactness, ban thus expressed himself, in 
a paper on the Traditions of the Rabbins : * By a singular im- 
provement on the pagan doctrine of the metempsychosis, there 
is also a reverse change of bodies ; and the spirit which had 
inhabited the form of a wild beast becomes occasionally the 
inhabitant of the human shup c.'— Selections Grave and Gay, 
Vol. XIV, p. 238. 

Mr. Do Quincey had forgotten, while writing this, what Hero- 
dotus— Euterpe, 123— says of the Egyptian*; and his researches 
on * the pagan doctrine of the me temp.--} ebosis * had not extended 
to India. 

The translator avails himself of this opportunity to state, for

so far as we can perceive, it works no advantage or 
prejudice to any one; and yet, either directly or in- 
directly, some soul or other will, without fail, be 
affected thereby, for good or for evil, in a greater or 
in a lesser degree. And so it cannot but be acknow-

in consequence of the acts of souls.

a cause of a jar; and gold, of a golden ornament. 
As every effect must have a material* cause, the Sys*

effects to be without a beginning. 1 

Since, then, souls are considered lo he, without

world, and since birth and death, and the doing good 
and evil works, and the arranging and disarranging of 
the multitudinous constituents of the world, in order 
that those works may reap their fruit, have been going 
on from eternity; it is patent, that the maintainors 
of the six Systems regard the world as having always 
had existence. To he sure, during its history, it has, 
from time to time, been resolved into its elements, 
and then evolved again; the gross world being sub- 
limated, on the occurrence of this resolution, into its 
subtile material cause; 2 but, as those mutations have

etc,, the work of Eishis, when those books do not

The foregoing are the leading dogmas of the Sys- 
tems; and, with trifling modifications, all the Systems 
hold them. 

An examination of these dogmas is fraught with 
very great benefit; for one gains, by it, an acquaint- 
ance with the general bias of the minds of the

I now proceed to sketch the more important doc- 
trines among those which characterize the Systems 
severally, the Vedanta excepted. 

The tenets of the Sankhya and Yoga are these. 
Nature and soul are the ultimate bases of all existent 
things. Souls are eternal and many. Nature is un- 
intelligent substance, and is the material cause of the 
world. It consists of goodness, passion, and darkness, 
in equal proportions . 1 And here it should be borne 

must require diversified development of things , bodies, etc , and 
the diversified de\ elopinent of things , bodies, etc., must require 
works. Let it be, theiefore, that Is\ara acts in dependence on 
works, after the dhersified de\dopment of things. There being, 
before such development, no work^ causative of inequalities, it 
follows, that the first creation ought to be one of unifojm 
equalities. The answer to this is, that it, the argument , is of 
no weight, “because of the unbeginningness ” of the course of 
the world. It would have weight, if the course of the world 
had a beginning. But the continuous operation, m the begin- 
ningless course of the world, of works and of inequalities of 
creation, as mutual causes and effects, after the manner of the 
seed and the sprout, is not incompatible.’

In the sixty-first aphorism of the Sankhya-pravachana, Book I,

It has been stated, that the letlexinn, in the huuI, of the 
internal organ’s affection is the cognition of that affection, 
itself a cognition. But this cognition of cognition is not 
analogous to that which, in the Nyaya, is styled auuervenient

this system, primary apprehension (vyavasaya) u m the form, 
for example, of ‘This is a jar’, and the relathe -uperumienfc 
apprehension is, ‘I cognize the jar’. This primary Hpprehffin- 
sion is, as we know, m the Sankhya, an affection of the internal 
organ, exemplified by ‘This is a jar’, etc ; and the reflexion, 
in the soul, of such primary apprehension, to which the SankhyaK 
give the name of psychic apprehension, agrees with it ip form. 
That is to say, it is ‘This is a jar’, not ‘ I cognize the jar'*

psychic cognition is precisely such as ‘ This is a jar ’ etc. Else, 
the aforesaid assimilation of intelligence to the affection of 
intellect could not be established. The form of the cognition 
of the affection is not different from that of the affection itself.

But, in consequence of the proximiiy to each other 

The writer goes on to say, that a cognition in the fmm of 
‘I cognize the jar’, which the Nan, iiyikas call a supervenient 
apprehension, is only another allection of the internal organ . 

^:%itsf%TTfe5R e i 

i ‘As the cognition 

“ I cognize the jar ”, “ I am miserable ”, or the like, it is merely 
another form of intellect. For the soul is immutable, and imob- 
noxions to euor.’ 

For the soul to acquire cognitions would presuppose it exposed 
to mutability, argue the Sankhyas. They further maintain, 
that, in all cognitions, sueh ns ‘I know', etc, etc., there us 
something of erroneousne>s ; for any notion implicating 1 T ’ 
11*1 lies the soul with the internal organ. To keep good the 
ground, that the soul never changes, nor errs, the them \ was 
set on foot, that all cognitions aibe 111 the mind, and that 
only their reflexions touch the soul, and yet without at all 
aflecting its essence 

Rut the doctrine, alike of the Sunkhya and of the Nyilya, 
that cognition and the consciousness of cognition are separate 
in fact is inadmissible. When I cognize a jar, simultaneously 
I become conscious that T do so. What the Naiy iiyikas term 
supervenient apprehension, arising after the primary, cannot be 
cognition- it is remembrance. The S sink In as’ reflexion, in the 
soul, of the primary cognition — their affection of intellect — 
is not, however, thought, by them, to present itself subsequently, 
but at the same time. Still, in postulating that reflexion as 
ft cognition of the primarv cognition, and as separate in fact, 
they also mistake. This kind of cognition of a cognition is 
not a thing of which any of us is cognizant; and it is to be 
rejected as a figment. 

As is primary cognition, so likewise the cognition of it, 
a reflexion of it, is an evolution from the internal organ. For 
all reflexions, as that of the aim in water, are, agreeably to 
the Sankhya, evolutions of intellect. "Near the extracts ro* 
cently made from the Patarijala-bhdshya-varftiliri, we are told:

that, since intellect and soul are colourless, there can he no

is here intended an evolution from intellect, m the likeness of 
each, east upon each, i.e., in soul, in the similitude of intellect, 
and, in intellect, in the similitude of soul : and also because 
the reflexion of the sun, etc., in water, etc., is nothing but mi 
evolution from intellect, in the likeness of the sun, etc.’ * 

4 We thus see, that the Sunkhyas consider not only primary 
cognition, but their secondary cognition also, fictitious an it 
is, to be merely an evolution from the internal organ, and no 
quality or urue affection of the soul. The relation of such 
secondary cognitions to the soul us no more intimate than 
that of a bird to the branch on which it perches. 

The psychic apprehension of the Sftnkhyas, the reader should 
rest assured, is the very reflexion of the internal organ’'- affection, 
and not something produced, by that reflexion, in the sours 
nature. From the passage of the Pdtan jaia- bhashya- varttika, at 
page 49, it is manifest, that the soul’s cognition of an intellectual 
affection is identically the reflexion of it, there spoken of an 
the assimilation of intelligence to that affection. Further proofs 
of this are as follows:

and its subject mentioned at pp. 48—0, the one theie designated 
as most eminent is adopted above.

are the soul’s affections. And there cannot be, in consequence 
of these unreal affections, any alteration in the soul.’ 

Hence we are to understand, that the reflexions themselves, 
in the hOiil, of the internal organ’s affections, which may be 
cognition, will, activity, happiness, or misen, are the soul’s 
cognition or knowing, and the soul’s experience of will, activity,

because they are nonentities, but because they are not what

But this is deceptive. The explanation K lhu~. rln t as

it is the reflexion of the affections, not •mil, that m cognition. 

Though the Sankhyas contend stremimi-ly, that the <«ul h

in this behalf is not entirely correct, they compound the m titer 
by giving to the soul the titles of cognition, knowledge, intelli- 
gence, etc., and yet lefuso to accept the legitimate erm-i <j lienees 
of such a procedure. And this fact will assist us to understand 
a singularity connected with the Sanhhya system. All >n«h 
cognitions as ‘I will’, ‘I am happy’, etc. etc,, sav its advocates, 
are erroneous; since qualities which arc not proper to the* soul 
are, thereby, attributed to it. Less erroneous, according to 
those philosophers, and erroneous on a different ground, is the 
cognition ‘I know*. Here, they sa\, there is not the attribution 
to soul of a property alien to it, but, rather, the supping that 
cognition is a property of the soul, whereas it m its essence. 
The untenableness of this is obvious. For it is not that cogni- 
tion, falsely so called by the Sankliyas, namely, the p-sencr of 
the soul, that is cognized in the consciousness * I know’, but 
that cognition which is truly the apprehension of object.-. \nd 
this latter cognition is neither the soul itself, nor a property 
of it. No more, on account of this cognition, is the soul real 
cognition, than it is a real experiencer of happiness and misery, 
by reason of the reflexions of them. For, in the S&nkhya, 
happiness, misery, will, and activity, no less than cognition, 
are evolutions from, and affections of, the internal organ. Their 
reflexions, not themselves, come in contact with the soul. 

To recapitulate . the Sankhya holds, that all true cognitions 
are evolutions from the internal organ. A primary cognition, 
as ‘This is a jar’, is an affection of that organ, and also an 
evolution from it ; and its reflexion falls upon the boul. This 
reflexion is psychic, or secondary, apprehension ; and it likewise 
is an evolution from the internal organ.

Furthermore, also the cognition ‘ I cognize the jar * is an 
affection of the internal organ. Its history is this. The soul, 
along with a reflexion of the affection of the internal organ,

On tliis topic the followers of the Simkhya allow 
themselves in singular theories, intelligible only at 
the cost of close attention. That the soul should be 
made out destitute of all specific qualities , 1 such as 
apprehension, will, etc,, is most material to thoir \ iows ;

of apprehension. Now, misapprehension itself is a

to regard both sorts of apprehension, the true and 
the false, as affections of the internal organ, or re- 
flexions, in the soul, of those affections. 

The precise mind of the advocates of the Sanfshyu, 
when they call activity an affection of the infernal 
organ, and say, that only from misapprehension does 
the soul esteem itself an agent, will now become clear 
to the reader. As is the case with apprehension, will, 
and activity, so is it with happiness and misery. That 
is to say, they are all evolutions from the internal 
organ ; 3 and their reflexions in the soul are the soul's 

non-discrimination, an affection of the internal organ, becomes,

longer deems itself a doer, its current works, or those 
which it does day by day, do not devolve upon it 
either merit or demerit. Only to exhaust the experi- 
ence of fructescent works, has it to remain m its 
body; and, when these works shall have received their 
full requital, it will relinquish the bod\, and there 
will be no more fear, for it, of Elysium, or of 11**11, 
or of metempsychosis, since then no works will ap- 
pertain to it, the experience of which will oblige it to 
tenant a corporeal frame. 

In connexion with this subject, what 1 have said 
above should be kept in remembrance ; that, agreeably 
to the Sankhya, neither apprehension nor misappre- 
hension actually belongs to soul, both being qualities 
of the internal organ. 1 Therefore, the cognition, * Tam 
distinct from nature, and am unchangeable \ is an 
affection of the internal organ : and this organ is an 
evolution from nature. So it is to he understood, that, 
as nature, by means of its evolution, misapprehension, 
binds the soul, so no less, through its evolution, right 
apprehension, does it set the scnl free. lienee nature 
is both the captivator and the emancipator of the 
soul. 2 According to the Sankhya doctors, the entire

Such are the chief doctrines of the Sankhya and

this great distinction between these systems, that the 
latter recognizes God, while the former ‘denies Him , 1 

‘Therefore, in reality, not any soul is bound, or freed, or

we find this claim to be futile. The God of the Yoga differs

The Sankhyas hold, that the Yeda had no author. 
Yet they do not, like the Mimansakas, contend, that 
it has existed from eternity. They say, that, at the 
beginning of 'each renovation of the universe, it has 
issued from the mouth of Brahma. Ho was no con- 
scious composer of it, however: it simply escaped 
from him like an expiration. Thus the Sankhyas, 
though maintaining that the Yeda originated from 
Brahma, would have it to be authorless. And they 
further declare, that, often as the universe has been 
redintegrated, the Veda has as often been produced 
without the least variation whatever, and thus has 
retained the same form from all duration of timed 

an evolution from nature. In the matter of oniHipre^MT—

asked, if apprehension, will, and the like, be allowed 
to soul, and these qualities be proved natural to it, 
what is to transform its nature, and how will its 
liberation be effected? For, in all the Systems, the 
absence of apprehension, will, etc., is held to he neces-

prehension, will, etc., being such, that all manner of 
wretchedness is believed to ensue, where they subsist. 
To be released from misery is, of course, necessary 
to emancipation. Hence all the Systematise, with a 
view to liberate the soul from every sort of wretched- 
ness, aim at devising some scheme for its getting rid 
of apprehension, will, and the rest; and each of 
frames a project after his own principles. As for the 
upholders of the Sankhya, to their mind, nothing can 
be done, unless the soul be demonstrated to have been 
devoid of apprehension, will, and all other qualities, 
from all time. 1 We have seen what extraordinary

As whiteness, a quality of white cloth, is here said to be 
natural to such cloth ; so, if cognition, will, happiness, misery, 
etc,, were supposed to be qualities of the soul— as the Naiyayi- 
kas assert they are — they would he called natural to it, in the

Just as, in complete liberation, there must be dismissal of 
misery, so must there be of cognition likewise ; it being itself 
a misery, and compounded of the three gtmas . See the note 
at p. 17 ; and a passage cited at p. 39, which implies that, 
if cognition were reckoned a quality of the soul; a loss would 
be sustained in liberation— when it must be parted with— and 
liberation would be no supreme aim of the soul. Will and

have been written solely for the purpose of magnify- 
ing works. With regard to this matter, the surpris- 
ing notions about to be noted are professed. It is 
recorded, in the Veda, that Elysium is obtained by 
sacrifice And a sacrificial observance consists in 
offering, in fire, clarified butter, flesh, etc., to Indra, 
Vanina, Agni, and other divinities ; with the recitation 
and intonation of hymns of praise from the Veda, and 
laudation of the exploits and virtues of the aforesaid 
divinities. Now, the Mimansakas, assert, that Indra 
and those other divinities have no existence whatever, 
and that the prowess ascribed to them is entirely 
fictitious. Nevertheless, there is such a wonderful 
potency in the falling of offerings into the fire, in 
men* name, after the manner prescribed by the Veda, 
and in uttering the sjllables of the songs that hymn 
them, as to ensure attainment of the celestial abodes. 

The Naiyayikas and Vaiseshikas hold, for their fore- 
most doctrines, as follows . 1 They believe in a God, 

S'astnt-dipika ; the manuscript not at hand for reference. ‘A 
god, incorporate, accepting and consuming a sacrifice , is satis- 
fied and becomes auspicious.’ 

Consonantly to the Mfmansa theory, works are instinct with 
an inherent potency for desert ; and, though the devotee may 
he convinced, that the gods are purely chimerical, Mlmansakas 
believe, that he derives \irtue, as it were magically, from adoring 
them. 

i Almost all the statements of this paragraph may be verified 
by a heedful perusal of the BhasM-garichchhcda. It has been 
translated into English by Dr. Boer, in the ninth volume of 
the Bibliotheca Indica. The reader may profitably compare 
with it Dr. J. R. Ballantyne’s translation of the Tarkasangraha,

described as one, eternal, immutable, without form, 
pervading everything, all-powerful, omniscient, framer 
of the universe, lord of all, arid bestower of the con- 
sequences of the good and evil works of souls, which 
souls have always existed. In order towards this 
bestowal, He fashions the world out of its material 
cause, and preserves the world, governs it, and brings 
if to a termination. The followers of the two systems 
just named maintain, that some of the constituents 
of the world had no beginning, and that others among 
them had. Of the former category are tin* originary 
atoms of earth, water, hre, and air, as well as other, 
time, space, mind, and soul. An atom is the minutest 
portion of earth, or the like; invisible to I be eye^ in- 
tangible to the hand, in short, inappreciable by any 
of the senses; and it is incapable of further division. 
It is supposed to have existed, spontaneously, from 
eternity. Prom the aggregation of atoms results what- 
ever is visible, tangible, etc,, earth and water, for 
example; and hence such things had a beginning, and 
are also liable to destruction. To souls belong appre- 
hension, will, activity, happiness, misery, virtue, vice, 
and other qualities; and they are eternal and innu- 
merable, and distinct from the body, the senses* and 
the mind. Further, they are all-pervading. It is only 
so much of the soul as dwells in the body, that can 
see, hear, apprehend, will, etc, ; and yet the psychical 
essence is not limited by the body, but is diffused 
everywhere . 1 Moreover, like the other Systematise 

1 No one of the Six Systems entertains correct ideas of 
spiritual substance. Material properties are attributed to it by

the Naiyayikas and Vaiseshikas allege, that the soul 
misapprehensively identifies with the body, etc., and 
that, consequently, to it all wretchedness adheres, and 
that solely through right apprehension can it escape 
therefrom, and attain emancipation. In the two sys- 
tems under notice, the ’Veda is believed to have God 
for its author. 

Such are the distinctive doctrines of the several 
Systems, the Vedanta excepted, which possess the 
greatest importance There are many distinctive doc- 
trines, in them, of lesser moment, which demand no 
mention on the present occasion. 

Now, any man of the least discrimination, if he has 
not girded his loins pertinaciously to withstand the 
truth, can readily discern, that, since these systems 
disagree among themselves, they cannot all be true. 
When one man calls a thing black, and another man 
calls it white, it is clear, that one or other of them 
is in the wrong. There are some people who labour 
hard to make out, that there is no discordancy among 
the Six Systems. Let them only look into the funda- 
mental aphorisms of those systems, and they will see, 
fhat the views laid down in one set are, in another

set, repeatedly brought forward and refuted, S'ankara 
A'charya and others even go the length of reviling 
those who deviate from themselves in doctrine. For 

all of them. For instance, they ascribe dimension to the soul ; 
and they further speak of it as actually touching matter. 
Again, though they hold the soul to be indiscerptible, they use 
such language as that, though diffused everywhere, it is in 
contact with a jar in the place where the jar is, and no 
elsewhere.

CHAPTER III 


An Examination of the Sankhya Doctrines (1) of the

How great is the error of the Sankhya in denying 
the existence of God! On all sides of us, in this 
Cosmos, countless and manifest are the tokens, from 
which it is certain, that some most mighty and in- 
effable Intelligence framed the world with design* 1 
Any effort directed to an end has, self-evidently, mind 
for its author; for only he who knows that a particular 
end will be accomplished by a given act, will engage 
in such an act with a view to such an end. We are, 
therefore, sure, that ha who does this act possesses 
consciousness; and such a one is called an intelligent 

i The dominant argument urged, in defence of the existence 
of God, by the theistical schools of Hindu philosophy, is, that 
the earth, the sprout, etc., must be referred to an agent, 
inasmuch as they are effects; according to the maxim, that 
‘ every effect implies an agent, as a jar, for instance \ Those 
-schools, and likewise the generality of Hindus, are, however, 
but little conversant with the theological argument, the subject 
of a portion of the present chapter.

being. Now, when, after contemplating a thing, we 
are certified that it is intended for a certain end, there 
is no room for doubt that an intelligent being has 
had to do with it. To give an example : I find, some- 
where, a pile of wood sufficient to cook a meal for 
four men, and as much as they would require of 
pulse, rice, meal, ghee, vegetables, and so forth, dis- 
posed in separate vessels, and a fire-place, and the 
ground clean round about. Would any sceptic, I de- 
mand, in all the earth, doubt whether the requisites 
aforesaid were prepared by some one for culinary 
purposes, or whether they collected together spontane- 
ously and fortuitously? Just so is it with a clock. No 
on|, on examining the arrangement of its wheels, will 
ever entertain a misgiving as to whether it was made 
by some one, and in order to measure time. Similarly, 
I maintain, that this world is full of innumerable 
things, analogous in character to those above men- 
tioned, on scrutinizing which it becomes certain, that 
they were made for such and such ends. 

And here it is to be noticed, that, as regards a 
^single thing — that is, not an aggregate made up of 
many and heterogeneous parts, jointly indicating a 
distinct final cause— though it be capable of produc- 
ing a certain end, still the doubt may arise concern- 
ing it, whether that end was contemplated, or whether 
it be governed by pure chance. Eor instance, I come 
upon one or two sticks. They may serve for cooking ; 
and yet I do not know, for certain, whether they 
were meant for that purpose. It may be, that they 
dropped accidentally from off somebody’s head, As 
they would answer for cooking, so they would answer 



100 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

for other ends as well. I might drive off a dog with 
them; or I might turn them to account as stakes* 
No one can say, with perfect positiveness, for what 
particular end, out of these and others, those sticks- 
were designed. But, when I see together a fagot, 
and water, and pulse, and meal, etc., no hesitation 
possesses me, but certainty, that those appliances are 
for cooking. And the ground of this certainty is, that 
each of them bears a share in cooking: and it is out 
of question, that all those heterogeneous articles, con- 
curnng to one end, could never have come together 
casually, each in its due measure and appropriate 
place, but must have been assembled by an intelligent 
being, and with design. Now, there are in this wqrld 
unnumbered things which, not being single and in- 
composite, accomplish fixed ends. Had they been 
isolated, it would have been hard to say whether their 
ends were not the result of mere chance. But these 
things are compounded of numerous constituents, gross 
and subtile; each of which is necessary, in its pro- 
portion, to bring about the end, and is also of due 
dimension, is adjusted to a fit position, and is con- 
stituted of proper material: as, in a watch, the parts 
that should be made of iron are of iron; and it 
is similar as to those that should be of brass, of 
porcelain, and of glass. 

Although there are many wonderful things in this 
world, which we of India did not heretofore thoroughly 
understand, yet the learned of Europe, with their 
subtile ingenuity, deep investigation, persistent industry, 
and the help of various instruments, have so explored 
the fabric of the body and of vegetable products, the* 



THE SANKHYA DOCTBINES 101 

earth, celestial system, and the nature, varieties, and 
properties of water, air, light, etc , that he who 
reads the books written by those men, gains an almost 
supernatural faculty of vision, and beholds on every 
hand innumerable evidences of the inscrutable power 
and exquisite skill of God. Even in the human eye 
we perceive an amazing and indescribable workman- 
ship. Between the structure of the eye and that of 
the telescope there is some resemblance ; only that 
the telescope is far inferior to the eye in nicety. 
Opticians have demonstrated, that everything seen by 
the eye must have its image refected on the retina ; 
and, with a view to this end, the skill which the eye 
reveals m its formation is such as to strike the mind 
wxcn astonishment. Part of the eye consists of lenses, 
and these are so disposed, and are made of such sub- 
stance, as that the desired end should be accomplished. 
Again, the eye has several internal departments; and 
so minute are some of them, as to be invisible, save 
with the assistance of the microscope. But all these 
constituent portions are constructed, and adjusted, and 
proportioned, agreeably to a fixed rule. As for the 
marvellous contrivances of the eye, adapted for look- 
ing at objects distant and near, and as the light is 
more or less; and the peculiar conformation of that 
organ in birds, fishes, and other animals, fitted to 
enable them to see objects according to their several 
circumstances ; and many other particulars relating to 
the o}e; if I were to treat of these topics exhaust- 
ively, I should be compelled to devote a large book 
to them. And now I would ask, if, on seeing pre- 
parations for cooking, or on inspecting a watch, we 



102 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

have no doubt of there being an agent in connexion 
with them, why should we harbour doubt, after look- 
ing upon natural objects such as have been spoken of, 
that they had a Maker? For, the same reasons that 
conclude an agent in the former case, present them- 
selves in the latter. If any one says, that, in the 
alleged instance of culinary ingredients, he has assur- 
ance of an agent, whereas he has none as regards the 
Maker of the world, I reply, that the reason is simply 
this, because of pride, he dislikes that the existence 
of God should be proved; and, consequently, he does 
not earnestly apply his mind to deliberate on the 
subject, and so he arrives at no conviction of the 
truth. 

Some men, too indolent to think, rashly argue c as 
follows : 1 With respect to cooking materials, and with 
respect to a watch, and so forth, we acknowledge an 
agent, on the ground that we have seen people making 
watches: but we have never seen any one making the 
world : and therefore we do not own that it has a 
Maker. My reply is: Let a man of this country 

never have seen any one making a watch, and let it 
be, that no one here could make one : Nevertheless, il 
a watch were to be shown to him, and if he were to 
reflect on the arrangement of all its parts, and on the 

1 What is objected in this and the next paragraph may bo 
thought almost too frivolous to merit refutation. At the same 
time, it correctly represents the crudities which one daily hears 
from the lips of young Hindus who have acquired a smattering 
of English, and have learnt, that there has been a single white 
man, ‘one Hume’, who rejected Christianity. The North- 
Western Provinces and the West of India are here especially 
referred to. 



THE SANKHYA DOCTRINES 103 

end of each, would he not confess it to be the me- 
chanism of some very ingenious artificer ? Know, that 
the reason for acknowledging an agent is not the see- 
ing one engaged in action, but, what I have stated 
before, namely, the perceiving that so many things, 
in due quantities and in fitting positions, have been 
collected together, every one of which, in its propor- 
tion, is indispensable to a certain end. Eor reason 
teaches, that it is impossible they could have been 
got together so systematically, but for the interven- 
tion of an intelligent agent. 

The word £ nature V with some unthinking people, 
is regarded as so potent a charm, that the bare utter- 
ance of it is sufficient to dissipate every doubt. It is 
oecsause of nature, they say, that a human hod} arises 
from human seed, as wheat grows from wheat To 
such persons I address a question: This ‘nature' 
not being an intelligent thing, endowed with under- 
standing, will, and other qualities, how can it effect 
that in which tokens of the operation of understand- 
ing and design art* distinctly manifest? Those who 
talk thus about nature plainly give proof, that they 
have not caught sight of the strong point of m\ argu- 
ment, which is in this, that, on examining a body, or 
other simihr thing, it clearly appears that it was 
made for eort.iiu ends, and that it exhibits, as con- 
tributing thereto, an adjustment indicative of great 
skill and forethought. Further, it is indubitable that, 
to devise am thing for an end, and to construct it 

1 This is not tho Kftnkhya ‘ nature’, prakriti, but our own 
polysemantic ‘nature’, so very imperfectly apprehended by the 
sciolists spoken of in tho last note. 



104 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

after an exact consideration of many components be- 
fitting it, is impossible but to an intelligent being. 
An intelligent Maker is, therefore, established. And 
how can this be refuted by speaking of nature? Can 
nature resolve on a particular act, and is it conscious 
that, by doing so and so, a certain end will be brought 
about? If it can do thus, it is proved to be God; 
and then I and my opponent differ only about names. 
If, on the other hand, it cannot do so, but is a 
thing inanimate and devoid of understanding, it cannot 
produce the effects which my opponent attributes to 
it. Por, if he reflects a little closely, he will see, 
that, though we may allow air to possess the nature 
of raising dust from one spot and depositing it in 
another, yet it would never enter the mind, that fee 
air should of itself rear a sumptuous house, or that 
fire should of itself cook pulse, bread, and vegetables. 

Now, observe the extraordinary position of the 
Sankhyas. They allege, that nature, for the sake of 
soul, engages in various works; and, by way of prov- 
ing this point, they adduce the example of milk, 
which, though inanimate, with a view to the suste- 
nance of the calf, secretes itself, they say, in the udder 
of the cow. 1 But this is bringing forward one thing 

I Tattva-kaumudi, p. 52 . « An insentient 

thing also is seen acting for an end. For example, insentient 
milk exerts itself for the nurture of the calf/ 

V&chaspati Misra thus writes m his annotations on the 
fifty-seventh couplet of the S&nkkya-MriM . 



THE SAHKHYA DOCTKINES 105 

insusceptible of proof in order to ratify another thing 
of the same character. For, as 1 have before shown, 
the doing anything for an end can be predicated of 
none but an intelligent being. When a man hardens 
his heart, and determines to uphold atheism, how 
blind he grows ! The Slnkhyas, for instance, have 
converted into instruments for disproving the exist- 
ence of God, that very thing which is an irrefragable 
testimony to the contrary. For the fact of milk, being 
produced in the cow’s udder for the sake of the calf, 
and countless other such things, go to prove, that 
God exists, and that all these are His works; but the 
Sankhyas use them to prove, that the whole world, 
every constituent part of which is fox an end, has 
for its author that which possesses no sentience — 
nature. 

Again, a most egregious error of the Sankhyas is 
seen in this, that, although they deny God, yet they 
believe in virtue, vice, and their fruits, and impose 
upon men’s shoulders the yoke of multifarious cere- 
monies, repetition of sacred words, austerities, medita- 
tion, etc. 1 One would indeed suppose that God must 
Ee the root, and the chief and first thing, in all 
religions. Except for God, who is there to enact com- 
mands and prohibitions? And how can there be an 
Elysium, or a Hell? For who is there to award the

need of good works, or the penalty of evil? The 
truth is, that all the originators of Sastsras, in this 
country, mistake in common m this, that, while dwell- 
ing on the consideration of virtue and vice, and their 
issues, they have forgotten, that the good and evil 
requital of virtue and vice is in this wise alone: — 
God has enjoined virtue, and forbidden vice; and 
hence, being pleased with the obedient, He confers 
happiness upon them, and, by reason of His equity, 
visits punishment upon such as disobey His laws* 
Oblivious of this, the authors of the systems by 
degrees came to regard works, like seed, for instance, 
as possessing a natural power of bringing forth fruit. 
This error is not so patent in the Naiyayikas and some 
others ; but it is most conspicuous in the Sanlfhya 
and Mimansa schemes, which even go the length of 
inculcating, that works can, of themselves, account for 
the production of the universe, and that there is, 
therefore, no need of supposing an intelligent Author 
of it. 1 To this momentous defect I shall return in 
the sequel. 

1 Vijnfina Bhikshu thus introduces the second aphorism of 
the Sdnkhya-p’avachanat Book V- 

I Sankhya-pj avachana-bhnshya, p. 170 ‘That 

which was asserted, viz., that Is vara cannot be pioved to exist r

there must be a giver of the fruit of works. They who

The aphorism pointed to is thus elucidated: 



THE SANEHYA DOCTRINES 107 

How strange, once more, is the view ox the Sankhyas 
concerning the Veda! At the beginning of each uni- 
versal renovation, it is emitted, they say, from the 
mouth of Brahma. But he is not its composer ; for he 
does not consciously frame it; it only proceeds from 
his throat, like an expiration. Against this I have to 
say, that no book can be originated that is not made 
knowingly. In establishing the existence of God, I 
have said, that, on seeing materials for cooking we 
are clear, that all the various articles are for the end 
of cooking; and it is, further, certain, that they were 
accumulated by some one. Just so, on observing, in 
a book, the apt arrangement of its sentences, words, 
and letters, and its orderly construction, it becomes 
cerftun, that this arrangement and this construction 
have, for their end, the expression of certain ideas, 
and hence, that some one wittingly assembled, as we 
find them, the letters, words, and sentences adverted 
to. For they unquestionably betoken a desire to give 
expression to certain ideas. But it is manifest, that 
this desire, and the collocation in fitting order, with 
a view to such expression, are not the work of inert 
elements of language; since none but a conscious

•{ffloNr l Ibid., pp- mo- i. 'it 

is not proper to say that, in a cause superintended by 
I^vara, there takes place an evolution which is the fruit of 
works; since the production of fruit may be accounted for , 
without the superintendence of Isvara, by works alone, which are 
granted , in all the systems, to he necessary for the production of 
effects. Such is the sense,’ 



108 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


agent could design, and no other Gould determine, 
such an arrangement} as I have spoken of. If the 
Veda was not devised by a conscious agent, how can 
it lay down injunctions and prohibitions? And how 
can it inform us touching the fruit of good and evil 
works? Even a child can understand, that, to give 
an order, or to notify a fact, implies mind, and not 
that which is destitute of it. Therefore, for letters, 
words, and sentences, things insentient, to come to- 
gether of their own accord, and to command, or the 
like, is impossible. 



CHAPTER IY 


Examination of the S&nkhya Dogma , that Nature is 
the Material Cause of the World 

The S&nkhya doctrine of nature likewise seems to 
me altogether unreasonable. Preferable, by much, is 
the doctrine of atoms maintained in the Nyaya and 
the Vaiseskika. I do not mean, that these systems 
are right in arguing, that the world is composed of 
eternal atoms for I do not hold that anything, God 
excepted, is eternal ; and I do hold, that, quite irrela- 
tively to any material cause, God created all things 
by Ills inscrutable might. What I here intend is, 
that, if one does not accept the belief, that the world 
was originated without a material cause, there is, to 
jpy thinking, no view left for him, more congruous 
with reason, than that which deduces the world from 
atoms. But what argument or reason is there for 
the proof of nature, and the great principle, and the 
organ of self-consciousness, etc. ? The Sankhyas assert, 
that happiness, misery, and insensibility inhere in 
everything 1 in the universe; and that, therefore, one 


S3 'O 

fcfqqr SlRT^lcfqr \ Sankhya-sira, MS fol. IX, recto. 



110 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


is constrained to believe the material cause of the 
world to be that which possesses those qualities. And 
such is nature. 1 But this is not correct , for happiness, 


‘Since, m like manner as we are wont to speak of jar-colour 
so, also, we are wont to speak of woman-pleasme,' sandal- 
pleasure, etc., it is proper to suppose, that pleasure and the 
like - inhere in objects. 5 

Vijnana is heie a victim to plnaseology on which, plainly 
enough, he did not reflect with sufficient attention. For ‘jar- 
colour 5 means * the colour of a jar 5 ; whereas ‘ sandal-pleasure 5 
means * the pleasure derived from the use of sandal \ Such 
fallacies are fai from uncommon among the pundits. 

The English rendering of the Sanskrit is just a trifle ad 
synesim

SAN KEY A DOGMA 131 

misery, and insensibility do not inhere in external 
things, but are qualities of an intelligent being, and 
reside in it alone : As I shall prove presently. The 

truth is, that external objects maj become the cause, 
to an intelligent being, ot happiness, misery, and so 
forth ; as lire, on being touched, produces pain. 
Fire is not, however, the site of pain, but only the 
cause thereof, to him who touches it. It is a surprising 
error of tin* Rankliyas, that they assign to the outward 
material world such things as apprehension, will, 
happiness, misery, and so forth — which are qualities 
of the soul, and reside in it alone, and have no inde- 
pendent existence — and further allege, that, as is the 
world, so must be its material cause, namely, nature. 
In unis way they make the soul to he insentient, and 

and insensibility, namely , nature, the unmanifested, is estab- 
lished for thorn, viz. for intellect , etcS 
Vfichaspati Mara’s language, throughout this passage, is 
somewhat lax. To exemplify : Instead of saying, that an 
effect is made up of the qualities of its cause, he ought, in 
strictness of Hindu terminology, to have said, that an effect is 
beholden, for its own qualities, to those of its cause. So, 
again, it is a loose mode of expression, to speak of nature as 
being made up of happiness, misery, and insensibility; since 
these, in philosophical rigour, are laid down as constituting 
nature’s qualities, or piopertios. This latter assertion is shown 

by what follows; cT TO T WE:

or components of nature , are made up of happiness, etc., it is

mind is one with resolve.* 



112 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


the world and its material cause to be intelligent. And 
while they make the latter to be intelligent, they say, 
that nature, the great principle, and so on, are nothing 
but insentient substances 1 Such strange entities as 
these can never be established by any ratiocination. 

Let the terms prahnti , sattva, rajas, tamas, buddhi , 
and ahankffra be taken otherwise than as the} are 
taken in the Sankhya, and the result will be very 
different. Goodness, passion, and darkness, a Naiya- 
yika might argue, may be conditions of soul, and 
therefore may be alleged, to belong to its nature : For 
{ nature,’ in such a sense, or svabhcfva , is one of the 
classical acceptations of the multivocal prah'itb. When 
the apprehensive faculties of the soul are in their full 
vigour, and when the soul is calm and unperturbed, 
it may be said to be in a state of goodness ; when 
agitated, and greatly drawn towards external objects, 
we may speak of it as being in a state of passion ; 
and, when it is stupefied, one may call it dark. 3 
Again, intellect is a quality of soul ; and to soul 
appertains egoism 3 also. If we understand, in some 
such way, the words selected, in the Sankhya as funda^ 

1 ^ i P . 20. 

* o 

‘The whole, nature, intellect, and so on, are insentient.’ 

2 The words goodness, passion, and darkness, with their 
conjugates, as here employed, and elsewhere, must be under- 
stood to be technical, and as inexpressive substitutes, at best, 
for the sattva, rajas , tamas , etc., of tho Sanskrit. 

3 In the Sankhya, buddhi, intellect, is the organ of cogni- 
tion ; aliankara, that of egoism : but, in this place, the 
Ny§ya view is adopted, that is to say, that intellect itself is 
cognition, and that ahanlmra itself is egoism.

mental technicalities, the things denoted by them can 
be proved to have existence ; but not otherwise. 

I am unable to say, with certainty, how the Sankhyas 
came to entertain such strange ideas on the subject 
under discussion. Nevertheless, considering the in- 
tellectual peculiarities of the pundits, and their method 
of argumentation, I hazard this conjecture. There is 
no question, that the atheistic Sankhya system was 
not primeval in India ; for, though the Mami-mihitd, 
the Gltd, and other books, in describing the generation* 
of the world, etc., countenance the tenets of the 
Sankhya, yet God likewise is there acknowledged to he 
the Author of the world. Hence, it seems to me, that 
the theistie Sankhya was first elaborated, and the 
atffeistic, by little and little, at an after-period. The 
germ of the former may have been as follows. It is 
written in the Veda, with reference to God, that, at 
the time the world was made, ‘He saw \ and that 
he said, ‘I am one: I would become many.’ By 
these words, perception and self-consciousness are 
implied to have arisen, in God, at the beginning of 
the universe: and perception is intellect; and the 
^notion denoted by *1’ is egoism. From this the 
ancients may have concluded, that God, in order to 
the construction of the world, assumed intellect and 
egoism; 1 and thus they may have been induced to

regard His intellect and egoism as the causes of the 
world. One will here ask: Though they thus account- 
ed intellect and egoism the causes of the world, still 
these are only its instrumental causes; and why do 
you suppose that they are held, in the Sankhya, 
to be material causes? The answer is, that the 
pundits have come, in process of time, to forget the 
true character of several things which they have been 
accustomed to treat about. Thus, in many cases, as 
concerns qualities, which are inseparable from things 
qualified, they have brought themselves to think of 
them as independent things possessing qualities. The 
founders of the Sankhya system, having long been 
used to call intellect and egoism the instrumental 
causes of the world, passed on to view them as 
independent objects, and have ended in making them 
the material causes of the world. In attributing to 
qualities the nature of independent objects, nay, in 
ascribing to them personality, the Hindus, in other 

‘He beheld’, ‘He saw’, etc., we learn, that, from intellect 
itself, produced at the outset of creation, was the croation of 
all besides itself.’

expedient argument on this behalf. Since, in passages of the 
Veda and of the Smritis, such as “ May I become many ”, “ May 
* I be produced ”, etc., it is set forth, that the creation of the 
elements and the like is preceded by egoism as a came, egoism 
is made out to be the immediate cause of the creation, which 
creation has an affection of intellect for its mediate cause/ 



THE SANKHYA SYSTEM 115 

instances as well, are seen to go amiss. Eor example, 
we find, in the Puranas and other books, accounts of 
the generation of love, wrath, serenity, content, and 
such like qualities, taken by themselves, and stories 
of their nuptials and so forth. The general error here 
animadverted on is not, however, peculiar to the 
Hindus. The old inhabitants of other countries than 
India were not clear of it. In the second and 
following centimes of the Christian era, Valentinus, 
Basilides, and other heretics, as is evidenced by their 
writings, made intellect, will, and other qualities to 
possess personality ; and they regarded them as makers 
of the w'orlcl. The progress in error of the Sankhyas 
was, it appears to me, somewhat similar to that of 
the Gnostics. It is evident, that, when the people of 
former ages had quite forgotten the reason which 
first led them to account intellect and egoism to be 
the causes of the world, and began to consider them 
as, in another way, the causes of the world, they 
likewise changed their ideas of the things denoted by 
the terms intellect and egoism, began to look upon 
them as organs of cognition and egoism, respectively, 
and as unintelligent substances, and, imagining a sub- 
tile source from which intellect could be evolved, gave 
that source the appellation of nature. Their reason 
for making nature to consist of goodness, passion, 
and darkness, was, perhaps, that intellect is sometimes 
in a state of goodness, sometimes in a state of passion, 
and sometimes in a state of darkness; and hence its 
cause, nature, must be constituted of three ingredients. 
When, subsequently, they saw, that the whole world 
might be derived from this nature, they concluded, 



116 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

that; there was no need of a God. It is thus, on 
conjecture, that the more recent Sankhya system 
sprang up; the doctrines of which, on all points, 
have, it may be, gradually undergone so much of 
alteration, that there is now not a vestige of similarity 
between it and the scheme from which it descended. 



CHAPTER V 


ExamimUon of the Ssnhhya Dogma , that Apprehen- 
sion, Will Activity, Happiness, Misery , and other 
Qualities , do not appertain to the Soul 

To deny that cognition, will, activity, happiness, and 
misery are qualities o£ the soul, and to hold them 
to«be affections of the internal organ, is utterly at 
issue with reason . 1 * * * * * * * I maintain, that apprehending, 
willing, doing, etc., are qualities of intelligence. That 
in which these qualities reside is called an intelligent 
being; and the same is a soul. The Sankhva xnay 
reply, that, in his nomenclature, that is called a soul, 

i The Sankhyas repudiate virtue and vice, witlial, as attri- 
butes of the soul, and style them qualities of the internal 

organ. Vijnana Bhikshu, as appears from an extract pre- 
viously adduced, denounces the Vediintins as Bauddhas, for 
their doctrine, that everything is unreal, virtue and vice 
included. See the citation from the Ba nkliyapmvcichana- 

bhd&kya, at the foot of p. 52. But are not the Sankhyas 

obnoxious to a similar reproach, for denying, that virtue 
and vice belong to the soul 9 

It may assist the reader, if he is told, that, in order 

fully to take in the present chapter, he should give a 

well-weighed consideration to the conspectus of the Sankhya 

system contained in Chapter ii, and to the passages appended

•which is unendowed with apprehension and other 
qualities. My answer is, that such a soul cannot, in

a one as I have, or as he has. Eor it is beyond 
doubt, that we both apprehend, and will, and energize, 
and become happy and miserable; that is, wo have 
the qualities apprehension, will, activity, etc. Nor can 
our consciousness of these things be illusive : u for 
there is said to be illusion, where there is a notion, 
but not a corresponding object ; as where, nacre

being mistaken for silver, there is the notion of 
silver, but not silver as the object of that notion. 
But the like of this cannot have place* as concerns 
our consciousness of apprehension, will, etc.; for here 
a notion and its object are one. Apprehension, will, 
and the rest are objects; the consciousness of them 
is the notion: and, in my opinion, they are identical. 
To be sure, when the light reveals a jar, the light is 
the manifester, and the jar is manifested; but the 
light, when we see it, is itself alike manifester and 
manifested. So, when will arises in me, itself mani- 
fests itself; for I express, that I have a will of some- 
thing. From this it is plain, that simultaneously 1 I

both will, and am conscious, or have a notion, of 
willing; whereas, if those acts, however speculatively 
two, were two in reality, they could not arise in the 
soul at the same time. Accordingly, since my own 

To those who think otherwise, that is to say, that will and 
the consciousness of it, for instance, are consecutive and distinct, 
the author would propound these two questions. Do they hold 
the notion, that will first arises, and, soon afterwards, the 
consciousness of it ; and that the two for some time co-exist ? 
Or do they hold the notion, that an act of the will is followed 
by the consciousness of it’ 

If the first, the author replies, that— as is expressed in the 
text— he cannot conceive how two qualities can either arise or 
remain in the soul together; and herein his opinion is, to 
some extent, supported by the doctrine of the Naiyfij ikas ; 
who contend, that the specific qualities of the soul ^aro 
antagonistic to the length of mutually displacing each other. 

The maxim on the subject is 

'O o 

siRparnt i In* order, however, that one such quality may 

displace another, their theory is, that the displacing quality 
must remain with the quality displaced during the last moment 
of the subsistence of the latter. Bee the note at the loot of 
p. 68, This view the author rejects as an absurdity. 

To the second position indicated above, the author makes* 
answer, that it is not consciousness which is there implied, 
but remembrance. On this ground, additionally to the one 
just mentioned, he considers as faulty the Naiyayika idea, 
which supposes, that the consciousness of will co-exists for one 
moment with will, and then subsists without it. What is here 
called consciousness, anubhava , as it is esteemed by the 
Nyaya, is not so, its object having departed; it is memory. 

At all events, if it be insisted, that will and the conscious- 
ness of will, etc., are distinct, still it is certain, that they are 
inseparable; and that they are so is sufficient to show the 
Sankhyas, that the definition of mistake, given above, lu 
inapplicable to such cases of consciousness. 



THE SANKHYA DOGMA 121 

consciousness and my opponent’s of our acts of ap- 
prehension, will, and oilier qualities, are not distinct 
from their objects, viz,, those acts of apprehension, 
will, etc., our consciousness cannot subsist sequestered 
from their objects; and, therefore, to characterize it 
as illusive would he erroneous; and, this being the 
case, my soul, or my opponent’s, is not such a thing 
as he describes to be destitute of apprehension, will, 
and the rest. If the Sankhya bestows its labour in 
order to the emancipation of such a soul, its labour 
is superfluous; and, besides, it devolves upon every 
one of us all to strive to save himself. But my 
opponent does not acknowledge this; ho asserting, 
that the soul described in the Sankhya is, in verity, 
sucti as his and mine, and yet contending, that it 
has no apprehension, will, or other qualities, I reply 
that this is totally at variance with all that is 
rational, 

I have distinctly shown, that my consciousness of 
my apprehension, will, happiness, misery* and so on, 
cannot be illusory. A Sankhya, who, shutting the 
eyes of his common sense, declares, that it is illusory, 
should take notice of this also, that, if it be proved 
so, neither can the fact of apprehension, will, happi- 
ness, misery, etc,, ho proved; since, but for concious- 
ness, there is no means of establishing their existence. 
Should it lie replied, that the consciousness of will, 
etc., is said to be an illusion only in this respect, 
that its objects, as will, etc,, though having existence 
as qualities of one subject, seem to appertain to 
a different subject, that is to say, being qualities of 
the internal organ, they seem to belong to the soul; 



m THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


I rejoin thus; The Sankhya says, that the conscious- 
ness 4 1 ’ is an affection of the internal organ alone, 
and that will, happiness, and so forth, are also affec- 
tions thereof. It is clear, accordingly, that they appear 
in their proper subject : and how, then, can the 
consciousness of them be illusion even in the respect 
in which he declares it to be so ? As I am aware, 
the mystery of the Sankhya’s fantastic economy con- 
sists in this. He holds, that the consciousness * I ’ is, 
in fact, an affection of the internal organ, but that 
it cognizes the soul, as being its proper object ; though, 
by reason of misapprehension, intellect also is cognized, 1 
as identical with the soul. Hence, the consciousness, 
‘ I will \ ‘I am happy ’, or the like, taking the soul 
for its object, attributes to it the alien qualities, will, 
happiness, etc. This consciousness, accordingly, is 
illusory. Further than this limit error could not 
extravagate. Can it be, that the consciousness ‘ 1 1 can 
refer to another than that which entertains it? It 
is certain, that when one who has a consciousness of 
4 1 ’ uses the word 4 1 he means his own self ; for 
there cannot be any other word more unmistakably 
denoting one's self. If 4 1 * denotes self, tell me whether 


1 SIT?*? 5%ftT 




Patanjala-bhashya-varitika, MS fol. 87, recto. ‘And, in the 
consciousness “I’* of ordinary people, who lack tight apprehen- 
sion, intellect also, i.e., besides soul, is, of necessity, cognized ; 
for there is no ground for the supposition , that the defect of 
the impression of unbeginning misapprehension is, in the case 
of tUs consciousness , debarred, or becomes inoperative ,* 



THE SANKHYA DOGMA 123 

any one but its subject can be that self. It appears 
to me, that a consciousness such as the Sankhya 
assumes has its parallel in a lamp whose light proceeds 
from another lamp, or in the shadow of a man cast 
by his neighbour. For the object of the conscious- 
ness ‘ I ’ is self ; and that in which there is this 
consciousness is its self : but, in that which is different 
from itself, there is not this consciousness ; and that 
in which there is not this consciousness is not the 
object of such consciousness. 

But perhaps the Sankhya will say, that I, their 
opponent, who hold, with the Naijayikas, that the 
notion 4 1 ’ is a quality of the soul, must grant that 
it is not unusual for the soul to identify things other 
than* itself with itself ; inasmuch as all men who lack 
right apprehension erroneously consider the body, etc., 
which are distinct from the sonl, to be themselves; 
for, if they did not so consider, they would not speak 
of themselves as being dark, or fair, as is conceded 
by the N&iyayikas also : and thus it is decided, that 
the consciousness * I ’ may take cognizance of an alien 
object. I reply, that, in my opinion, men do not 
generally take their bodies, etc., to be their souls ; and 
the fact, that they say, 4 1 am fair or 4 1 am dark 
does not prove that they so take them. This shall 
be shown, when I come to consider the Nyaya and 
Vaiseshika systems. Even if I granted, that some 
men thus misconceive, still such a mistake would not 
be one of perception, but one of inference. If it be 
said, that it is from using his eyes, that a man calls 
himself dark, or fair, and that, therefore, his notion 
is a perception; I have to reply, that, on looking at 



124 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

his body, he indeed sees it to be dark or fair: yet the 
notion, ‘This dark body, or fair, is myself \ is not 
a perception, or immediate cognition. For the im- 
mediate cognition ‘ 1 5 cannot have for its object either 
the body, or its darkness or fairness. Know, there- 
fore, that men apprehend only their proper selves in 
the immediate cognition ‘ I and that, as, by means 
of their eyes, and other organs of sense, they cognize 
a jar, or cloth, precisely so do they cognize their 
bodies. When they perceive, that, from changes in 
the body, cognitions of happiness, misery, etc., arise 
In the sonl, they infer, and wrongly, that the body 
is the soul. Thus, then, it is ceiiain, that their error 
is not of immediate cognition, but inferential. They 
reason, that, since the soul receives happiness 
misery through the medium of the body, the body is 
self. The consciousness ‘ I ’ is an immediate cognition ; 
but it cannot have the body for its object. Again, the 
body or the like is cognized by means of the eyes 
or other organs of sense; but those organs cannot 
have the soul for their object. Hence, the confounding 
together of soul and body is the work of inference, 
not the work of perception. I was correct, therefore, 
in saying, that the immediate cognition ‘ 1 1 can have 
no other object than self. And, just as it cannot 
have an object different from itself, so the qualities 
will, happiness, misery, and the rest, of one cannot 
■appear, in immediate cognition, as located in another* 
Por I have already said, that will and other like 
qualities are their own manifesters. They must appear 
where they reside; and how can they appear else- 
where ? Moreover, since the consciousness, 1 1 * can 



THE SANKHYA DOGMA 125 

have only itself for object, how can the will, happiness, 
etc., which seem to belong to another, be the objects 
of such a consciousness as ‘I will % etc.? 

But the Sankhyas, though they deny cognition and 
other qualities to the soul, perceive, that, if it neither 
cognizes, nor wills, nor is miserable or happy, it 
cannot be called bound. Why, then, their philosophy, 
and all their toil to liberate the soul? This objection 
they anticipate; and, to rebut it, while they refuse to 
regard cognition, etc., as qualities of the soul, they 
maintain, that in some sort, it experiences cognition, 
will, and so on. To arrive at this conclusion, they 
speculate as follows. Cognition, etc, which they call 
affections of the internal organ, are reflected in the 
soul ; and these reflexions 1 of cognition and so forth 
are supposed to bo experiences of cognition, etc.: 
a distinction being taken between the two classes. 
In this way the soul becomes an experience? of 
cognition, will, happiness, and misery. The experience 
of cognition being itself a cognition, the soul may be 
said to cognize. But the experiences of will, happi- 
ness, and misery cannot, suitably with tho Sankhya 
system, be denominated will, happiness, and misery. 
Hence, it is not allowed, that the soul wills, and is 
happy and miserable, but only that it is the ex- 
periencer of will, happiness, and misery ; though, 

* The European reader must be constantly on his guard 
against supposing, that by reflexions, the Sankhyas mean 
figuratively impressions made in the essence of the soul. 
What the Sankhyas do mean will be seen from the present 
chapter, and from the second, with the notes attached to the 
latter. 



126 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

occasionally, the reflexions of happiness and misery 
are found spoken of as happiness and misery, instead 
of experiences of them. Those experiences are, how- 
ever, pronounced to be unreal; for an experience of 
this sort, while the reflexion of an affection of the 
internal organ, is likewise an evolution from that 
organ, precisely as its affections are, and extrinsic to 
the soul When it is termed unreal, it is not meant, 
that it has no real existence, but that it does not 
inhere in the soul, and that it is incapable of pro- 
ducing any change in its essence. It is like the re- 
flexion, in crystal, of a red rose: where, only from 
misapprehension, would it be thought, that the colour 
reflected belongs to the crystal. Now, in our view, 
the soul cannot be an experience!’ in consequence of 
the reflexions spoken of. For, when a man has an 
experience, a change really takes place in his soul. 
This would be the case, the Sankhyas admit, if cog- 
nition, will, happiness, and misery could be regarded 
as qualities of the soul ; as they are regarded by the 
Naiyayikas, whose dogma on this point, as making 
the soul changeable, the Sankhyas arraign as unsound. 
.On the Sankhya ground, then, that the reflexions in 
•question work no change in the soul, and are alien 
to it, the soul cannot, By reason of them, become an 
experiencer. Nevertheless, the Sankhyas, strange to 
tell, for all that they say these reflexions are extrinsic 
to the soul, declare, that, owing to them, the soul 
becomes an experiencer of cognition, will, etc. In this 
there is a plain contradiction in terms; for it amounts 
io an assertion, coupled with a denial, that the soul 
Fas experience. The following remarks will enable 



THE SANKHYA DOGMA 127 

us to understand how the Sankhyas came to entangle 
themselves in such an incongruity 

Most imperfect and erroneous, generally, are the 
notions of the so-called Hindu philosophers about 
things metaphysical and physical. Whatever two 
things these schemers see to be in relation, they must 
straightway ascertain the species of that relation. 
For instance, after laying down the proposition, that, 
wherever there is smoke there is fire, the first step 
to be taken, towards completing the proposition, is, 
they say, to ascertain the relation that subsists 
between the smoke and the place of its appearance. 
So, likewise, the relation of the fire to the site it 
occupies must be ascertained. And it is only by these 
relations, that the smoke is a token, and the lire that 
which is betokened, 1 The two relations here instanced 
are of the same sort, known as sanyoga . Again, 
it is deemed necessary to determine the relation 
between a quality and that to which it belongs, and 
between a whole and its component elements, etc. 
The evil that has sprung from thus theorizing 
is, that the pundits came to look upon relations, 
sanyoga, samavffya,* etc., as real objective entities, as 
having existence apart from the objects they connect, 
and were led to sunder things further than it is 

. i Such relations arc called, respectively, hctuMvachchhedaha 
and sadhyatavachchhcdaka ; or * the determinator of betoken ed- 
ness.’ 

s Sanyoga , one of the four and twenty qualities of the Nyiiya, 
is contact, the mutual touching of two substances. Only, as 
mentioned in the text, it is an entity, and has existence 
irrespectively of the substances to which it belongs. Moreover, 



128 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

reasonable to sunder them. Thus, according to the 
Naiyayikas, substance may sometimes be so far inde- 
pendent of qualities as to want them altogether. The 
qualities of what they reckon as originated substances 
are not produced, they allirm, until after the produc- 
tion of those substances themselves. Take a jar, for 
example. During the first moment of its production, 
it is devoid, m their view, of all qualities whatsoever, 
as colour, smell, taste, and tangibility. In the second 
moment it becomes endowed with them. Again, the 
Naiyayikas contend, that a whole is a different thing 
from the mere sum of its parts. By the joining 
together of the parts a new entity is generated in the 
whole which results: 1 as has been remarked, it has, 

it is destroyed by mbhaga 4 separation ’ ; which also • is a 
quality. But, as a cause must exist* prior to its effect, sepa- 
ration, before performing its destructive office, is fabled to 
co-exist with contact for a single moment. 

Samamija , like sanyoya , is, m the first place, an entity. It 
is the relation between substance and quality, between a whole 
and its parts, etc. It is eternal ; so that, though the things 
which it stands between perish, itself remains. Numerically, 
it is one ; and thus it is the same samavaya that connects a 
jar and its colour in India, and another jar and its colour In 
Europe ; and that connected Adam’s soul with its qualities, 
and that connects the reader’s with its own. As the reason for 
maintaining its unity, the Naiyayikas simply refer to the lex 
parctmomon, and leave common sense altogether out of the 
question. It is useless to try to translate samavaya. Colebrooke 
substitutes 4 aggregation, or intimate and constant relation ’ ; 
Dr. J. R. Ballantyne, ‘intimate union’, ‘inherence’, 4 coinher- 
ence’,, 4 coinhesion’. 

1 It was a favourite pleasantry of a late most celebrated 
Naiyayika pundit at Benares, that, in rigid accordance with 
his system, on receiving back from a goldsmith ornaments 
wrought from metal furnished to him, it would be quite just 



THE SiNKHYA DOGMA m 

for a single moment, no qualities , 1 whereas its parts 
have; and it resides in its parts by the relation styled 
samavaya. It is because a whole is predicated as 
residing thus in its parts, that the Naiyayikas, in. 
respect of the enunciation, that smoke betokens (ire;, 
set about, first of all, to ascertain by what relation 

to demand double weight, that of the original gold, and, 
again, as ninth m ornaments. For it is not held, that, on the* 
production of a whole, the parts concurring to it are anni- 
hilated. 

Tfc is because of their notion regarding the novelty of wholes t 
that the Xaix.iyikas are designated as asatJidtyarddins t in 
contradistinction from the Sanbhyas and Veda at ins, who are 
termed satkaryarddins ; the foimer holding, that an effect is- 
non-existent before its production, and the latter, that an 
effect has existence, in it* material cause, antecedently to 
manifestation, or eduction, alhivyalti. Hence, Sfmkkyas dc 
not hold, that a property and its substrate, dharmn and* 
dharmm, are altogether alien to each other, hi one sense, it 
is true, they are taken as different; but, in anothei sense, 
they are reputed one. The reader will have observed, repeatedly, 
in foregoing notes, the expie«sion dharmS-dliarmy abhedat, 

* because of the non-differenee of a property and that which is 
propertied.* 

In this case, the S.uikhyas and the Yedantms approve them- 
selves nearer to rationality than the Naiyayikas ; but the case 
Is rare of its kind 

1 The reason assigned is this. Every effect must have thiee 
c&uses, the samavayi, amnavdyt, and nvmtta. A jar, when 
produced, is considered to be a new entity; and the same view 

taken of its qualities. Of the jar, its parts are the samavayi 
cause ; the contact of those parts, its asamavayi ; and the 
potter and his implements, its nimitia. Of the qualities of the* 
jar, itself is the samavdyi ; and the qualities of the parts o! 
the jar, are the asamavdyi of those qualities. Their nvnxitta is 
as before. As every cause must precede its effect, the jar, a 
cause of its own qualities, must exist previously to the pro- 
duction of its qualities. 

9 



130 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


it does so. For, as smoke is said to reside in a place 
by the relation of scuujoija, so it is said to reside in 
its parts by the relation of 5 amavdi/a. Therefore, by 
simply asserting, that, wherever there is smoke there 
is fire, one is apt to mislead ; since smoke, besides 
residing 111 a given place, resides, by the relation of 
samavffytt, in its own parts, where fire is not. 

We have now learnt how the Xauaukas, by trans- 
muting relations into entities, and interposing these 
entities between things correlated, dissever what in 
nature we find most closely allied. Accordingly, these 
philosophers, though they profess to believe cognition, 
etc , to be qualities of the soul, are seen — when we 
come to understand how they speak of qualities and 
substance — to make them extrinsic to it. When, 
therefore, cognition, etc., are said, in their character 
of qualities to belong to the soul by the relation of 
sammtiya , we recognize a position inadequate to that 
of their residing in the soul by inherence ; 1 and yet 


\ \en recent authority, of most respectable weight, speaks 
thus of the three Naiynyika causes . * It is commonly under 
sfcood ; that the N'aya philosophy acknowledges three sorts o| 
causes, substantial or inherent, non-substantiul or exterior, and 
a third which might, perhaps, bfe conveniently styled the 
operative cause’-— Professor Banerjea’s Dialogues on the Hindu 
Philosophy , p. 127. 

1 Let it not be supposed, that, because the Xttiy&yiJ&g 
repute substance the samavdyi cause of its qualities— as w m 
said in the last note- they look upon qualities as being 
intrinsic to substance. For, in the twenty-four qualities, they 
include differentness, contact, separation, remoteness, etc,, m 
real entities Of these also the substance in which they reside 
is the samavdyi cause, and they cannot, with any propriety, 
be said to be intrinsic to such substance. 



THE SANKHYA DOGMA 131 

the Nyaya, on the point immediately under discussion, 
is much nearer to the truth than the Sankhya and 
the Vedanta. 

And now we are prepared for easy apprehension of 
a transition to a much graver error. If the soul, ask 
the Sankhyas, may become a cognizer, etc., from 
possessing cognition, etc., by the relation of samaviTya , 
why m a) it not become so from possessing cognition 
and so forth by any other relation? That the soul 
becomes thus possessed by the relation of bamavtTya, 
they refuse to admit ; since the admission would imply 
a change in the soul’s nature. Still, studious to make 
out the soul a cognizer, etc,, or else an experience!* of 
cognition, etc., they proceed in this wise. The re- 
flexions of cognition, will, happiness, misery, etc., are 
experiences of them, severally. These reflexions, or 
experiences, rest upon the soul. To the Sankhyas an 
alternative is here, they think, presented They allow 
themselves to suppose, that the soul cognizes, wills, 
etc., in the affections of the internal organ, cognition, 
will, etc., which are connected with the soul by the 


Obviously enough it was the old, and all hut unnet^ally 
diffused, ex-nihilian maxim, which suggested to the Nai\ ayikax, 
that every effect must ha\e a samardyi cause; a cause which, 
by legitimate deduction from that maxim, ought to mean 
one from which an effect is evolved, or developed. From 
this notion the Naiyayibiis have, however, strayed afar ; and 
what they intend by their mmavdyi cause is equally unintelligible 
and unaccountable. This is evident from their contending, 
that an effect is altogether a new entity, as compared with 
Its sammiyi cause ; and from this, that they maintain substance 
to lie such a cause of its own qualities ; these being extraneous 
to it, and of a different category. 



1-32 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


relation of reflexion; or to suppose, if they choose, 
that the soul is an expen encer of cognition, etc., in 
those reflexions, the experiences of cognition, etc., 
which rest on the soul by the relation of sanyotfa . 
In order to the soul’s cognising, etc., what does it 
matter, the Sankhya asks of the Naiyayika, if cogni- 
tion and the rest do not reside in the soul by the 
relation of samavfiya ; seeing that the soul has tlmm 
by some other relation; and there being no ground 
for restriction to the relation of sainavfiya? The 
Naiyayika, thus controverted by the Sankhya, cannot, 
in my opinion, return,: with his imperfect views, any 
answer founded :in» reason. 

Precisely the error of the Sankhyas, which has 
just been detailed, is that of a distinguished puffdit 
of Benares, to whom I applied for solution of divers 
of my doubts. One of my questions was as follows ; 
Since, if the Sankhyas believe that misery resides in 
the soul as a reflexion only, which reflexion is held 
to be an evolution from the internal organ, the soul 
cannot really be miserable, why all the toil of the 
Sankhya system to liberate the soul? The reply was, 
in part, as follows : 1 ‘ And if thou intendest to im$ly 
that, according* :to the Bankhya % the soul cannot be 
miserable through the unreal relation of reflexion, 


1 First, he detected an :inaccurac*y in the expression * If 
the S&nkhyas believe, that misery resides in the soul m 
a reflexion only * ; for, m strict Sankhya phraseology the reflexion 
of misery is not misery, but is its experience. Ever and anon, 
.however, the ; Sankhyas express themselves as the author 
: expressed himself. See the first passage from the Sanhhpa* 
pratmhana-bhashya . given at the foot of p. 44. 



THE SJNKHYA DOGMA

. . . thou shouklst be asked, in return, “ Though 
thou boldest, as in the Nyflya, that the suffering of 
misery, which is an experience, is a quality, still, how, 
either by that quality, or by samcmiya , can the soul 
be miserable ?”’ 1 In passing, the pundit assumes, 
inadvertently, that I here go the whole way with the 
Naiyayikas. I take his purport to be this. If, with 
a view to prove the soul miserable, a relation between 
it and misery, an affection of the internal organ, is 
demanded, the relation of reflexion is available ; and, 
should it be objected that the soul cannot become 
miserable by such a relation, it may be inquired how 
it can become so even by the relation of samavSya ? 
Then he goes on as follows : f And what superiority, 
save thy long eomersanev with it, dost thou see in 
the Naiyayika system, that it alone pleases thee?

134 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


Another question proposed by me was this : If 
misery belongs to the internal organ, how can its 
removal profit the soul? The Pundit replies: 5 The 
fact, that misery resides in another than the soul, 
does not prevent its cessation from being a good to 
the soul For misery, which is held, by those who 
abhor the relation of reflexion, to reside in the soul 
by samaviTija , resides, by some other relation, in what 
is not soul.’ 1 In the N\aya, cognition and other 
qualities, though residing in the soul by the relation 
of samavifya , are spoken of as residing in time by 
temporal relation, in space, by spatial relation, etc. 
What the learned Pundit means is, then, this. If it be 
argued, that, because the Sankhyas believe misery to 
reside in another than the soul, that is to say, in the 
internal organ, its removal cannot benefit the soul, 
neither can its removal benefit the soul even according 
to the Naiyayikas ; inasmuch as, in their view, misery 
resides, by various relations, in other things besides 
the soul As we are aware, agreeably to the Sankhya, 
misery, etc., are qualities of the internal organ. If 
they are so, what has their continuance, or their elimb 
nation, to do with the soul? But of this weighty 
objection the Pundit makes small account. The reason 
is, that, to his mind, samavffya, here a relation of 
the first importance, is quite on a parity with what 


<0 * v3 

cfiJTfaq «^qrvtr?qfq s\qpr 1 



THE SANKHYA DOGMA 135 

are here inferior relations, such as the temporal and 
the spatial. This will serve as a sample of the degree 
to which the common sense of the pundits has become 
distempered. And I shall now address m 3 self to show 
what that relation is between the experience of cogni- 
tion, will, happiness, misery, etc., and that which is 
in truth the experiencer of them. 

First, however, I must bestow a few words on the 
great error, committed by the Sankhyas, ot distin- 
guishing between happiness and the like, and their 
experiences. Who is conscious of any such distinc- 
tion ? From experience of happiness deduct experience ; 
can one then form any idea what happiness is by 
itw^Jf? Not at all. Consequently, all the qualities of 
the soul, to wit, cognition, will, activity, happiness, 
and so on, ought to be regarded as so many different 
sorts of experience; as was previously exemplified, in 
the case of will. Or, should there be some very nice 
distinction between happiness, or the like, and the 
experience of it, the two, at all events, are inseparable. 
It follows, that there is no foundation for the theory 
of separating cognition, etc., from their experiences, on 
which the doctrine depends, that the internal organ 
is the subject of happiness and so forth, and that the 
soul is their experiencer. 

And now I purpose to make out, that the soul 
cannot, by any chimerical reflexions of cognition, will, 
etc., he erroneously regarded as experiences of cognition 
and the rest become an experiencer thereof. It is 
self-evident, that the experiences of cognition, will, 
happiness, misery, etc., are qualities of their experi- 
encer: for a quality is that which cannot exist abstracted 



136 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

from its substrate. For example, the existence of 
-colour, or of taste, or of length, or of breadth, under 
such abstraction, is impossible. And it is the same 
■as concerns the experience of cognition, or the like, 
considered severally from its experience. Indeed, ex- 
perience, thus circumstanced, is brought into the 
category of the son of a barren woman and the horn 
of* a hare. From this it is clear, that the experiences 
of cognition, will, etc., are qualities ; and, being such, 
they are connected with their substrates by the rela- 
tion through which every other qualih belongs to 
that which possesses it. 

In the terminology of the Nai>ayikas, the relation 
between quality and substance is that of ,s lamavQya, 
But this sanuivffya , as they describe it, seems to me 
not only hypothetical, but irrational ; and so 1 decline 
to designate by it the relation between quality and 
substance. To this i elation I assign no name what- 
ever. When, in our argumentations, we have reached 
the boundary of the certain and of the intelligible, 
there is nothing left for us hut to be silent. As for 
the relation of quality and substance, feason teaches* 
us that it is widely different from sanyoga and such 
other relations. It is a relation through which quality 
penetrates and permeates the very essence of substance, 
and participates in it. Just so does experience with 
reference to an experience*. 

A reflexion, though in respect of space it is very 
near the soul — in fact, within it, like everything else ; 
for# in the Sankhya, the soul is all-pervading — is far 
remote from its essence. In the Sankhya scheme, it 
is * an evolution from the internal organ, and must 



THE SANKHYA DOGMA 137 

reside in the soul by the relation of sanyoya, and not 
otherwise. Now, how can the soul by virtue of it 
be an experience!* ? For, if it has not experience in 
its pi oper essence, it has none at all. Analogically, 
let it be, that a sage sits ever so close to a fool, or 
embraces him, if you will , can the fool, in consequence, 
be pronounced wise ? 

The European physicists, who have explored acou- 
stics, optics, and other similar departments of science, 
declare tint, when a man sees an object, the following 
process is transacted. First, the object is imprinted 
upon the retina behind which is a sensory nerve con- 
necting it with the brain. The nerve and the brain 
ar$ thus successively affected. Then, owing to some 
relation between the brain and the soul, that is to 
say, between matter and what is not matter, the 
object seen is cognized. That relation is incompre 
hensible ; and yet cf so much we are certain ; that 
neither does the objects being reflected into the eye, 
nor does the effect produced in the sensory nerve, 
through the reflexion, nor does the action upon # the 
•brain, through the sensory nerve, constitute the soul’s 
cognition. For, though the relation between the brain 
and the soul is most intimate, still the brain is distinct 
from the soul, and extrinsic to it. The soul’s cognizing 
consists in this, that itself, that is to say, by its essence, 
apprehends an object through the eye and the other 
media enumerated. 

The conclusion is, that, if the Sankhya’s reflexions 
of the affections, cognition, will, activity, happiness, 
and misery, are distinct from the soul’s proper essence, 
they are not the soul’s experiences of cognition, will, 



m THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

etc.; since, though, as to space, they are exceedingly 
proximate to the soul, yet, viewed essentially, they 
are as distant as the east from the west. Inasmuch, 
therefore, as the soul can neither cognize, nor will, 
nor energize, nor be happy or miserable, nor be an 
experience!* of cognition, etc., why should the Sankh}as 
strive so hard to liberate it 0 In another way, more- 
over, the Sank hy as deceive themselves and others. 
They say, that happiness and the like are not really 
m the soul, but that, fiom non-discrimination, the 
soul thinks itself miserable and bound . tins is its 
wretchedness, emancipation from which is desirable. 
In this statement there are two great errors. One is 
this. The non-disci imination spoken of is itself 
affection of the internal organ. As such, it has no 
intrinsic relation to the soul ; only that of a reflexion ; 
and how, then, can the soul be prejudiced by it ? The 
other eiror is this. Even if the soul, from non-dis- 
crimination, did think itself miserable and bound — 
which the Sankhyas will not grant — still, it could 
tak$ no harm merely from thus thinking, so long as 
it did not, in reality, incur misery by reason of non-r 
discrimination. If, then, the Sankhyas conceded, that 
it thus incurs misery, it would be really miserable. 
And, if they deny — and they do deny — that it does, 
it follows, that it stands in no need of being emanci- 
pated. 

Therefore, that position only, which is laid down 
in the sixty-second stanza of the Smkhya,~k8rikx, can 
be justified on Sankhya principles ; namely, that it is 
not the soul but nature that is hampered and that 
is disengaged. 



THE SANEHYA DOGMA 


m 


I have already shown, that the Sankhyas go to 
all the trouble they take to prove the soul devoid of 
apprehension, desire, etc., in order that the soul may 
be proved susceptible of emancipation , 1 They allege, 
that, if apprehension, desire, happiness, misery, and 
the rest be acknowledged to be qualities of the soul* 
they must be a pait of its proper natuie: and the 
nature of anything is inalienable. Only by making 
out the soul to be unendowed with apprehension and 
the like, they say, does its emancipation become pos- 
sible. For, in the view of all the pundits, there is no- 
emancipation apart from insentience. That riddance 
from pain is indispensable, we all hold alike. Now,, 
let it be granted, for a moment, that these notions* 
are correct ; that is to say, that emancipation cannot 
take place without the abolition of apprehension, and 
that misery, like cognition, etc., if a quality of the 
soul, must continue for ever. Still, it is impioper, out 
of fear for the soul, to describe a thing as being other 
than it is, and to give aid to such a deceit by sophistry. 
I mean, that it is wrong to insist, that apprehension* 
desire, and so on, which are really qualities of the 
soul, are not so. Man, we know, is mortal But, if., 
from dread of death, I, a man, affirm that I am not 
a man, shall I on that account escape death ? If* 
therefore, the Sankhyas are convinced that whatever 
has apprehension, desire, etc., for qualities is doomed 
to the fearful evil of never parting with them, it is. 

i It cannot but seem extraoi dinary blindness, in the Sankhyas* 
not to perceive, that the \ery efforts which they put forth to 
show, that the soul is capable of being emancipated, go tc 
prove that it has no need of being emancipated. 



140 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

the counsel of wisdom, seeing that they are left 
without resource, to abide their lot in patience, and 
not to belie reality. 

The truth is, however, that the pundits’ notion is 
baseless, that emancipation consists m definitive aliena- 
tion of apprehension, etc. And the assertion of the 
Sankhyas is eironeous, that, whatever has misery for 
a quality can never he discharged of it. When the 
cause of misery is removed, the misery likewise takes 
its depaiture: and Almighty God will deliver from it 
whomsoever He blesses with Hi3 grace. I shall treat 
of these points when I discuss the Nyaya. 



CHAPTER VI 


Brief Consideration oj one Topic of the Mimansef, with 
a Jew Remarks on the Intellectual Peculiarities of 
the Pundits , and on their Style of Reasoning. 

Greatly do the Mimansakas en, in not acknowledging 
Gqfl ; 1 and, again, while they do not acknowledge 
Him, in believing in virtue and vice, and in laying 
upon the heads of men the burthen of rites and 
ceremonies; and, lastly, in maintaining, that the Veda 
has existed from eternity. My refutation, in the third 
chapter of this section, of the first two of these errors, 
as held by the Sankhyas, will equally well apply to 
the MImansakas, But there is this difference of view 
between the two schools, as regards the Veda. The 
Sankhyas hold, that, at the beginning of every reno- 
vation of the universe, it issues anew from the mouth 
of Brahma, but without his composing it; whereas, 
according to the Mimansakas, it has always existed; 
and the same arguments that are good against the 
former notion are just as cogent when applied to the

ttfsi chapter of the Sdstra-dipika, labours at length to overset

142 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

latter. However, as for this latter view, that is to 

say, that the Veda was made by no one, but of itself 

has been in existence from all duration, one may 

indeed wonder at such an irrational theory. If asked 

for their proofs of this, the Mimansakas can only 

reply, that no name of the writer of the Vedas has 

come down to us. 1 But what sort of a proof i.s this? 

Many is the book whose author’s name nobody knows; 

but do we infer, therefore, that such a book never 

had a beginning in time? And how, pray, differs an 

ancient book from an ancient house? And who ever 

concluded, that an old house had been built from the 

beginning of all things, on the ground, that its 

builder’s name has been lost in oblivion? There is, 

in short, onl} one topic connected with the Mimansa, 

on which I purpose to rem&ik. It is as follows;* — 

To find, that the Mimansa esteems the Veda to be 

infallibly authoritative, and, nevertheless, decides that 

the gods named in it are all imaginary,* and that the 

relations concerning them there are mere fables; and 

to find, that, though Indra is denied to exist, yet to 

.make offerings in his name is sufficient to ensure

great reward; cannot but strike one with astonish 
ment. Wherever, allege the MTmansakas, the gods 
and their exploits are spoken of in the Veda, it is 
not intended to recount actual facts : the end in view 
being to magnify the benefit of ritual acts, and so to 
allure men to engage in them. But how can any 
one who has the slightest discrimination say, after 
reading the Veda, that the persons who originally 
addressed its hymns In Indra and others, did not 
themselves believe these* to *be real divinities? And 
who can imagine a mail’s doing worship to an unreal 
god, and singing praises to a nonentity, and imploring 
nobody, in the expectation of receiving, therefore, 
eminent recompense ? 

this subject MTmansakas seem to reason thus. 
All our strivings are for the attainment of reward; 
this reward being dependent upon works; and in- 
formation about works being obtainable from the pre- 
ceptive enunciations of the Veda, if we accept these 
fclnee things, why need we accept more l} If we hold 
the precepts of the Yeda to he true, what harm is 
there in our looking upon the rest of the Yeda as 
& romance? And, if reward comes of works, these 
suffice; and what is the use of the gods and the rest? 
Again, if works give rise to various fruits, then, as 
a seed possesses an innate power of originating 
a sprout, so, by maintaining that works possess an 
innate energy, we are enabled to account for the pro- 
duction of the world; and what necessity , in that case, 
is there of a God? To refute such strange notions 
may be spared : the very statement of them is refuta- 
tion. Still, I shall reply to them in the third chapter 



144 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


of the second section, where I speak of the error into 
which the pundits fall on the subject of virtue and 
vice. 

Thus I have examined, in the present and three 
preceding chapters, the main doctrines of the Sankhya' 
—the Yoga included — and of the Mimansa. Any man 
whose common sense is unsophisticated, on inspecting 
these doctrines as set forth and defended in the 
Sankhya and Mimansa, must perceive, that the pundits 
are most faulty in th^r manner of argumentation . 
As compared with those systems, the Nyaya and 
the Vaiseshika are greatly eligible. And yet their 
adherents also, ancient and modern, betray the 
intellectual defects common to all the pundits ; as 
will before long be evinced. 

Even as concerns things that are self-evident, these 
scholars go deplorably amiss. When a person reaches 
this state, it is most difficult to bring truth home to 
him. If a man, for instance, gets to doubt whether 
he has twenty fingers and toes, who can resolve his 
misgiving for him *? You count them, one by one, to 
him ; but, nevertheless, he cannot satisfy himself that 
they make up a score. After this, there is no hope 
of removing his uncertainty. Something similar to 
this state of mind is that of the pundits; as one 
cannot but see, on looking into the Sankhya and 
Mimansa. To dispel their difficulties is, consequently* 
no easy task ; and yet I have ventured to undertake 
it. But, such are the peculiarities of my country- 
men— as I know from old experience— that they will 
not understand my answers; and the real reason is* 
that they do not wish to understand them. Where 



MIMANSA AND PUNDITS 


145 


there are persons who cannot be reached by rational 
arguments, we can only commend them to God; for 
to Him is possible what to man is impossible. 

In this, again, the pundits manifest their wrong 
habits of mind, that when they set about considering 
a subject, they do not, first of all, soberly ask them- 
selves what the facts are, bearing on it, which they 
and others are acquainted ’frith. Such is the spell 
over their minds, and, from prepossession towards 
what they wish to believe, such is the partiality of 
their contemplation, that they adopt maxims which 
are baseless, as if they had no imperfection, and 
accept defective illustrations in place of proofs, and 
reason on the strength of them: nor do they reflect 
whether their arguments are cogent or futile, or 
whether they may not be met by counter-arguments. 
And so they go on, rearing one thing upon another, 
utterly regardless of the preposterousness of their 
conclusions. 

One more defect of their intellectual constitution is 
this, that they fail to inquire what things are within 
the range of human reason, and what are beyond it. 
With the short cord of human wit they vainly essay 
to measure the profundities of God’s fathomless per- 
fections, and to determine their limits. He who 
will act thus cannot but stumble and at last fall 
disastrously. 

* People who follow the dictates of common-sense 
steer clear, for the most part, of such errors. Common- 
sense is that sense which is shared by the generality 
of mankind. By its aid, even the illiterate and rustics 
are able, in their daily occasions and transactions, to 
10 



146 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

judge between the true and the false, and between the 
useful and the harmful. When any one, abandoning 
it, sets about adducing grand arguments in support of 
his favourite notions, he is very apt to get lost in 
a wilderness of nonsense, and to think, that the ground 
is above his head and the sky beneath his feet. But, 
to obey the admonitions of common-sense is not the 
way of the pundits ; ’and so we see how such 
wonderful dogmas as they profess came to be sug- 
gested to them. 

Their style of reasoning may be illustrated by the 
following story. Once upon a time, two men, travelling 
in company, laid a wager as to who would first reach 
the end of the next day’s journey. One of them, 
getting up early the following morning, saw uu&t 
the other was still asleep- With great complacency, 
he thereupon dressed, tied up his kit, and set off. In 
his haste, however, unawares to himself, he put on the 
other’s turban instead of bis own. Hurrying forward, 
on reaching the end of the day’s journey, he found 
his companion had not got the start of him, and was 
not even within sight. And then he sat down, 
opened his bundle, took out his mirror, and began io 
inspect himself. Seeing that he had on the other’s 
turban, he flung down the mirror, exclaiming : ‘ Alas J 
well-a-day ! I have taken all this trouble to get here 
first; and, after all, my friend has outstripped me/ 
On this, a by-stander, who had heard his lament, 
began to reason with him. ‘ What do you mean 7 * 
said he. ‘Here you are, arrived and waiting; and how 
can you say, that your friend has, after all, outstripped 
you? Can you be so bewildered as to believe, that 



MlMANSA AND PUNDITS 


147 


your sense of self has been transferred to another ? * 
But still he turned a deaf ear. He had resolved on 
taking it for an invariable rule, that his friend’s tur- 
ban could be on no one’s head but his friend’s ; and, 
accordingly, he must infer, that he himself had 
become the other, and that he had all along been 
labouring under illusion, in thinking it was himself 
who had started first on the day’s journey, and 
prosecuted it, and completed it. 




SECTION II 




SECTION II 




CHAPTER, I 


Briefly prefatory with an Examination of the Nytiya 
and Vaiseshika Doctrines touching God . 

I shall now consider the Nyaya and the Vaiseshika. 
But, as I have before noted, there are many doctrines 
common to almost all the Systems. When I take up 
suaii points, in discussing the Nyaya and Vaiseshika, 
what I shall offer will, therefore, be applicable to the 
Systems generally. 

At the outset I remarked, that the authors of nearly 
all the Systems announce, as the great end of their 
compositions, the attainment of final beatitude. At 
their respective beginnings, the Nyaya and the Vai- 
seshika Aphorisms make distinct statements to this 
effect. And so far forth they are worthy of commen- 
dation; it being most fitting to all men, and it being 
of all things most necessary, that they should strive, 
with their entire might, to find out the means of 
salvation. Yet, I cannot concur with the partisans of 
ihe Systems, in regarding right apprehension as the 
chief cause of emancipation ; my own belief being, 
that this effect springs from the spontaneous grace of 
God. I acknowledge, indeed, that right apprehension 
is instrumental to salvation ; but it is not that right 



152 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


apprehension, consisting in discriminating between 
soul and what is not soul, which the authors of the 
Systems teach to be the sole means thereto. That 
sort of right apprehension, taken by itself, I hold to 
be of no benefit; a position which I shall substantiate 
by and by. The sort of right apprehension which 
I maintain to be beneficial is this: rightly to apprehend 
God, and oneself, and one’s wretchedness, and the 
way of escape from it, and what man ought to do, 
and what he ought to forbear. I do not mean, 
however, that to acquire, in its entirety, a right appre- 
hension of these things is absolutely necessary; for 
this is impossible to man. I mean, that he ought 
to make this acquisition in so far as it is indispen- 
sable to his good. Requisite right apprehension, •as 
concerns God, should be such as to move man to 
honour, to love, to worship, and to fear Ilim ; such 
as to purify man’s nature, and to lead him to love 
virtue and to abhor vice. And, further, a man’s right 
apprehension, pertaining to himself, should be so much 
as to enable him to appreciate his place in the order 
of the universe; to think of himself as he appears in 
the sight of God; and to understand his relation to 
God, and his relations to his fellow-creatures, in order 
that he may be qualified to act according to those 
relations. And, again, a man’s right apprehension 
should be sufficient to qualify him to realize his own 
wretchedness, so that he may take thought how to 
escape from it; and sufficient for him to acquaint 
himself with the means calculated to bring about such 
escape, so that he may avail himself of those means, 
But of these things there is no correct account in the 



NY AY A AND VA1SESHIKA 


153 


Nyaya, or In the other Systems, Ear from it, they 
inculcate numerous eirors concerning them. 

Most inappropriate is the account given, in the 
Nyfiya and Yaiseshika, of tho divine attributes, such 
as God’s greatness, power, wisdom, holiness, and 
justice. 

The soul, atoms, the mind, and many other things, 
no less than God, they hold to have existed from 
eternity, lake God, they have been, of themselves, 
from all duration, and were created by no one. How 
far does this view fall short of God’s greatness, abso- 
luteness, and sovereignty ! According to the Naiyayika, 
souls and atoms are innumerable ; and, if they have 
always had spontaneous existence, it is manifest, that 
thair existing is not in subordination to the will of 
God. As they had not their origin from God's will, 
so neither could they be by Him brought to nought. 
Even if God had willed otherwise, no change could 
have boon operated as to their existence: nor will 
He be able to operate any such change. How, then, 
can absoluteness and sovereignty be predicated of 
God, as regards them ? Him we call absolute and 
sovereign, on whose will, or permission, everything 
depends; and without entire* subjection to whose will, 
nothing can be or happen. If the existence of souls, 
atoms, etc., bo not subject to the will of God, His 
sovereignty does not extend to their existence. On 
this principle, God cannot be proved to be God : for 
God is He who is over all 

To this view the pundits would bring forward this 
objection : ‘If you deny unbeginning existence to 
atoms, what cause of the origin of the world can you 



154 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

produce ? For every effect must have a material 
cause ; as a jar, clay But for the clay, of what will 
the potter make his jar Y In this way God formed 
the world out of atoms ; and how could He have 
made it without atoms ? ’ In reply, I would ask the 
pundits, whether they consider the power of God to 
be of like kind to that of® the potter. If the powers 
of the two be similar, then God required limbs and 
appliances ; just as the potter, in fabricating a jar, is 
obliged to use his hands, feet, and sundry other 
implements. And, if it bo conceded, that God, unlike 
the potter, bad no need of limbs and appliances, but 
could have made the world by His mere will, where 
is the difficulty in acknowledging, that He could have 
created it without a material cause ? By Ilia inscru- 
table power He was able to originate the entire world, 
material cause and material effect together. If it be 
objected, that this is inconceivable, I would ask, 
whether it be not equally inconceivable, that God 
could have framed the world out of atoms, by His 
will alone, and without recourse to bodily members* 
Do we see, anywhere among men, a workman of such 
skill, as that, by a simple operation of mind, be can 
call effects into being? My opponent may perhaps 
say, that the human soul answers these conditions ; 
for, by its mere will, it sets the hands and feet in 
motion: apd he may add, that, in like sort, at the 
beginning of the world, God, by His will, imparted 
motion to the terrene and other atoms. Let the 
parallelism of the illustration be granted ; yet the 
main difficulty, that of inconceivability, is still where 
it was. We know, to be sure, that the soul, by its 



NYAYA AND VAISESHIKA 


155 


mere will, moves the hands and feet. But who can 
comprehend how this comes to pass? The will is 

invisible and intangible : resembling neither a cord, 
with which a thing may be brought near; nor a staff, 
with which a thing may be raised or thrown down. 
How can it have any influence on the hands and 
feet, which are insentient matter? And how can it 
raise or depress them ? The whole is inconceivable. 
If, then, the works of God outreach our conception, 
how can we assign limits to His power, which is 
inscrutable? But the soul’s communicating motion 

to the hands and feet cannot properly be drawn 
into analogy : for the hands and feet are of 

the body, which belongs to the soul ; but terrene 

acal other atoms are not of the body of God, He 

being bodiless. The difficulty of operating, bj the 
mere will, upon what is not of one’s body remains, 
therefore, precisely where we found it. Nor can you 
call terrene and other atoms the body of God ; 1 for 
you cannot maintain, that the qualities and nature of 
body are possessed by them. Thus, the body influences 
the soul ; but you cannot affirm, that God is affected

by terrene atoms, etc., in the same manner. Since 
there are, thus, numerous characteristics of body 
which do not appertain to the terrene and other atoms, 
if you give the name of God’s body to those atoms, 
still our bodies cannot he adduced as analogous to 
them. My meaning, in sum, is, that, whereas the 
tenet, that God created all things by His infinite and 
inscrutable power, is not open to exception, the 
opinion, which, in arguing the independent and 
unbeginning existence of the material world, undeniably 
abridges God of His supreme absoluteness and plenary 
sovereignty, is imbued with error. 

There are two particular objections, say the pundits, 
to the view, that souls had their origin from God. 
The first is, that it involves, ns against God, The 
imputation of unequal dealing and cruelty. The 
second is, that, if wo hold souls to he generated, we 
must hold them to be destructible. I shall return to 
these points in a short time. 

The Nyaya and Vaisosbika dogma, which is also 
that of the Yoga and Vedanta, that whatever God 
does — as in framing the world, for instance— He 
does solely for the purpose of awarding to souls the 
fruit of their works— He doing nothing of His own 
free will— is, likewise, exceptionable. On what ground 
is God believed to be thus fettered? To know, to will, 
and to do are natural faculties of an intelligent being; 
and, if God is an intelligent Being, it is congruous 
to maintain, that, by virtue of His free will, Ha can 
act whenever it may seem good to Him so to do. 

To this the pundits would reply, that, if God, 
without reference to the works of souls, of His mm m

imputable to Him, that there was some want, to 
satisfy which He engaged in creation : 1 but, if it be

works of souls, we may judge, from the ensuing passage, how,

of souls, the blemish of His having a want will not 
attach to Him ; and it follows, that He made the 
world for the sole purpose of awarding to every one 
the consequences due to his deeds. My answer is, 
that neither do I maintain, that God matin the world 
to fulfil any want implying that He lacked aught, to 
obtain which He engaged in creation : hut I do main- 
tain, that, by reason of one of the perfections of Ilis 
nature, goodness, He was pleased to make manifest, 
through the medium of creation, His supremely love- 
worthy and wondrous attributes, God made the 
world, says my opponent, in order to requite the 
good and evil deeds of souls. But why should lie

and which I sets aside, here arises, to wit, that 
there was some want of God’s to he supplied by 
such requital. If it be replied, that, in virtue 
of the equity 1 of His nature, He awards to each 
the fruit of his works, I rejoin, that it is in virtue 
of an excellence of His nature, namely, His goodness, 
that He made manifest His supremely loveworthy 
attributes by creating souls and by making them 
to rejoice in the contemplation of His perfections. 
Any one has discrimination enough to perceive, that, 
from mere vanity, to go about exhibiting one’s 
importance, under the impulse of a longing to hear 
it proclaimed by the world, is one thing ; and that 
it is quite another thing, to make manifest the 
excellence of anything because such manifestation is 
fitting and laudable. When a foolish man, actuated 
by vanity, goes here and there to display his impor- 
tance, everybody laughs at him. But, if a learned 
European were to bring some very extraordinary 
machine to this country, and invite people to his 
house, and show them the wonders of the machine 
free of charge, no one would * deride him, but, on 
the contrary, all would thank and praise him for 
his gratuitous kindness and trouble. Just so, the 

superintend works; since, but for his very superintendence 
works; being unintelligent, could not proceed to act ; and, conse- 
quently, as their effects, namely, the body, the senses, and 
sense-objects would not be produced, the non-production of 
misery would be a matter of facility,’ 

3 Indeed, the reply here put into the mouth of the Hindu 
gives him credit for clearer notions touching God’s equity 
than he could really come by from study of his so-called sacred 
books. 



X 60 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

manifestation of anything that is excellent is no 
fault, but itself an excellence. God, therefore, because 
of the very excellence of His nature, makes known, 
through creation, and otherwise, His loveworthy 
and wondrous attributes. That such attributes, cal- 
culated to awaken affection and joy, should for ever 
remain hidden, would seem most unmeet. 

Let us now consider God’s attributes of justice and 
holiness, as viewed m the Njaya and Yaisoshika. 
As for His justice, if we scan these systems super- 
ficially, it may seem, that the doctrine of Ilis 

bestowing requital according to works involves it. 

And, when the followers ot those s} stems declare, 

that even the most trifling pain endured in this 

world must be taken to have had sin for its cause, 
and that, therefore, a former state of existence must 
be admitted, or else God's equity suffers the imputa- 
tion of imperfectaess, it looks as if they believed, 
in all its fulness, in justice as an attribute of Deity. 
On looking more closely, however, we find, that here 
too they are quite in the dark, as also touching 
God's holiness. 

As I have before remarked, the Systems receive the 
Ye&as, the Smritis, the Pura^as, etc., as authorities. 
The former, therefore, share with the latter any faults 
ascribable to them on the score of portraying amiss 
the justice, holiness, and other attributes of God* 
Let it not be supposed, that I am going out of my 
way to fasten faults on the Systems. Secrets, which 
else lurk unperceived, necessarily stand forth In any 
thorough-going examination such as that with which 
I am occupied. 



NYAYA AND VAISESHIKA 161 

No man is ignorant, that God is just and holy; 
and we need not be surprised to find Him so called 
in religions of human origin. But man, unaided, 
cannot attain to a correct knowledge of the holiness 
and other attributes of the Deity. His inability be- 
trays itself, when he ventures into details on the 
subject, or, incidentally, when he is treating of 
matters cognate to it. Hence, the express declara- 
tions regarding God’s holiness and other attributes, 
which we find in a book on any religion, are not 
a sufficient warrant, in the examination of that religion. 
Further and fuller exploration is indispensable. We 
should consider all that there is in the book, and 
also what is there omitted, and likewise all that has 
legitimate connexion with its subject-matter; and 
then we are in a position to pass judgement on it. 
From the fact, with reference to the Systematists, 
that they admit as authorities the Vedas, the Pura- 
nas, etc., it comes out, that, if the Nyaya and 
Vaiseshika do not, in express words, militate very 
greatly against the justice and holiness of God, it 
is not because the writers on those schemes enter- 
tained fit and correct notions of the divine attributes, 
but simply because they did not dilate on those 
topics. Had they done so, they would have ex- 
hibited errors of every description. 

Again, if we search out what the Systematists 
teach concerning those things which man is to do, 
and those things which he is to forbear, and other 
points allied with religion, we may learn what views 
they hold of God’s justice, and holiness, and other 
attributes. For, so strict is the connexion between 
11 



162 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


morality and theology, that any faults which are 
found in views about the former imply, of necessity, 
faults in the views held about the latter* Of mo- 
rality grossly wrong ideas occur in the Vedas, the 
Puranas, and the rest, and, where these err, the 
Systems participate their errors. 

I shall, moreover, show, in the sequel, that the 
doctrines of the Systems, taken by themselves, touch- 
ing virtue and vice, are signally faulty; and, such 
being the case, from this ground also it results, that 
they mistake as regards holiness and others of the 
divine attributes. 

According to the tenets of the Nyaya and Vaiseshi- 
ka, God can in no wise possess the attribute of 
mercy. It being one of the dogmas of these systems, 
that no effect can take place irrelatively to the works 
of souls, whatever a soul receives must be accounted 
a consequence of its works; and, if it succeeds in 
attaining to salvation, it earns salvation. It is evi- 
dent, that there is an exercise of mercy, when God 
bestows what has not been merited. The existence 
of such mercy is at variance, however, with the dog- 
mas of the Nyaya, of the Vaiseshika, and of all the 
ether systems. 

Moreover, since the Nyaya and Vaiseshika deny, 
that God made the world of His free will, but affirm, 
that He did so to requite souls, they altogether do 
away with the goodness which He evinced in crea- 
tion. When we behold God's world, on every side 
we perceive evidences of His wonderful goodness and 
bounty. In the first place, man, before he was 
•created, was nothing; but, in vouchsafing to him 



NYAYA AND VAISESHIKA 163 

existence, and life, and the faculty of knowledge, 
how has God constituted him capable of happiness ! 
Though, now in our fallen state, it is ours to suffer 
much misery, still all our suffering, nay death itself, 
is the fruit of our sin; and we alone are to blame 
for it. Had man never sinned, his happiness and 
especially that which, by reason of his rectitude of 
mind and purity of original nature, he would have 
•enjoyed from knowing God, from devotion and love 
to Him, and from communion with Him, would have 
surpassed description. When we behold the sun, 
the source of so much gladness and benefit, or the 
moon and the sidereal world, it seems, indeed, as 
though the goodness of the compassionate Author of 
ouY being were holding converse with us in a bodily 
form. The very trees, which comfort and refresh 
us, and yield us their luscious fruitage, and the 
charming mountains and rivers which embellish the 
earth, almost call upon us, with united voices, to 
give praise for the love and bountifulness of our 
merciful Father. But who could adequately depict 
the countless sources of happiness which God has 
created? And each and all of them are manifested 
to us as tokens of His goodness, when we come to 
believe, that He fashioned the universe of His own 
free will, and from the bountifulness of His nature. 
But the Naiyayikas and Vaiseshikas, having estab- 
lished it as a maxim, that all things are indebted 
for their origin to the works of souls, have over- 
spread these glories with the blackness of gloom. 
And they have transformed God into a hard-natured 
huckster, who secures his pay from his customers, 



164 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

and sells his wares by rigid tale, weight, and mea- 
sure. So much for the description of the Supreme 
Being which we meet with in the two most reason- 
able of the Hindu Systems. 



CHAPTER II 


Examination of the Nyciya and Vaiseshika Tenets re - 
lative to the Soul; namely , that %t had no Begin- 
ning , that it is All-pervading , that it takes 
Birth again and again. 

Numerous are the faults of the Nyaya and Vaises- 
hika, even in their account of the soul. Souls they 
hold to have existed from eternity, and to be, each, 
diffused throughout all space. I have already pointed 
out, that, if unoriginated existence be ascribed to any 
but God, His deity is impugned. I now purpose to 
consider the grounds on which souls are maintained, 
by the Nyaya and Vaiseshika, to have existed al- 
ways, and to be diffused everywhere. If we do not 
so believe, say the advocates of those systems, the 
soul must be perishable. As for existence from all 
duration, it is argued, that whatever had a beginning 
will have an end; as a jar, cloth, etc.; and, there- 
fore, if a soul once began to be, it will some time 
cease to be . 1 But I would ask, "what foundation 
there is for the maxim, that all which has had a 

1 What the Hindus esteem to be the most unanswerable 
argument -of the soufs eternity will he considered hereafter. 



166 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


beginning shall have an end. Should it be replied, 
that the history of a jar, or the like, supplies founda- 
tion for it, I rejoin, that what may be predicated 
of jars and such-like material things is not on that 
account predicable of the soul; so great is their 
disparity. Moreover, the origin, continuance, and 
termination of anything depend solely upon the will 
of God. If it pleased God, could He not, by His- 
infinite might, preserve a jar for ever and ever? 
By evidence 1 which I do not here adduce, it is 
established, that human souls are immortal; and so 
it is evident, that it is the will of God, that they 
should be so. And can anything thwart His power 
to do as He wills to do? Can the aforesaid majim 
of my opponents obstruct His infinite power? It is 
a great mistake, in them, to take up a maxim gratui- 
tously, and then to wish to fetter with it the whole 
world, nay, God Himself, whether it be appropriate 
or inappropriate. 

As a proof of the maxim of the pundits, that what- 
ever had a beginning must have an end, it is alleged, 
that every originated substance is necessarily made 
up of parts, 2 and that the parts of anything thus 

J It is not opportune, at this place, to indicate more distinctly 
than in this manner, the only certain warrant for believing in 
the soul’s immortality, namely, the Holy Scripture.

this language: ^ fd^cf

not without parts: being an originated;; substance, it is mad* 
up of parts.’

constituted may come asunder, and so the thing will 
perish sometime. To this I have to say, as before, 
that all such suppositions are applicable to material 
things alone; and that the origination, continuance, 
and end of all things depend solely upon the will 
of God. 

That the soul is all-pervading must also be be- 
lieved, say the pundits, if we would consider it to 
be indestructible . 1 According to them, dimension is 
of three descriptions; atomic, intermediate, and in- 
finite. Atomic dimension is the last degree of 
minuteness. Intermediate dimension is that of a jar, 
of cloth, or of any originated substance whatsoever. 
However great it may be, it has limits. Infinite 
dimension the third kind is unlimited. It is this 
species of dimension which, the pundits teach, be- 
longs to God, to souls, to ether , 2 to time, and to 

>3 Cv 

{ Sankliya-pravacJiana-bhashya, p. 35. ‘ And if it 

were acknowledged, that the soul is “limited”, or finite — like 
a jar and such other things — since, as is the case with these, 
it must possess the properties of having parts and of being 
destructible, the resulb would be a tenet contradictory to that 
of our system: 

Annam Bhatta says, speaking of ether; 

1 Tarka-dipiM, MS fob 7, verso. 4 As being, like 

the soul, all-prevading it is , like it, eternal.’ 

2 A characterization of SMsa will serve to show how inade- 
quately it is represented by * ether b In dimension, it is, as- 



168 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


•space ; and whatever has this dimension is all-pervad- 
ing. Enrther, according to them, things of atomic 
or of infinite dimension are indestructible, but those 
of intermediate dimension cannot be indestructible. 1 
A soul, then, to be indestructible, must needs be, in 
size, either atomic or infinite. If it be the first, then 


has been said, infinite ; it is not made up of parts , and colour, 
taste, smell, and tangibility do not appertain to it. So far 
forth it corresponds exactly to time, space, Isvara, and soul. 
Its speciality, as compared therewith, consists in* its being the 
material cause of sound. Except for its being so, we might 
take it to be one with vacuity. 

In passing, this is, doubtless, the fifth element referred to in 
the following words of Megasthenes, as cited by Strabo: 

Si row- rirrapcn c Trefjwrrr) rfc eert, 

r}<; o ovpavo<; /cal ra acrrpa. — Schwanbeck’s Megas- 
thems Indica , p. 138. 

i Vijnana Bhikshu says of the soul wrcfwFM erc- 

1 Sinkhyarpmvachana-bhashya, p. 35. 

* It it were of intermediate dimension it must be constituted of 
parts, and, therefore, would be destructible.’ 

The following also refers to the soul : ?[ UJ ; J 

(J Tarlka-dtpiTcS, 

MS fol. 8, verso. « It is not of intermediate dimension. If it 
were so, from being uneternal, and hence ‘perishable, there 
would follow the destruction of what is done, and the accession 
of what is not done.’ 

What is meant is this. The works of the soul are assumed 
to be inalienable and inevitable. On the theory, then, of the 
soul’s perishableness, its works would miss of their effect, which, 
by the hypothesis, cannot thus fail. Further, newly created 
souls would reap fruit which they had not sown. 



SOUL 


169 


its qualities, as apprehension, will, etc., cannot be 
subject to immediate cognition; for there is another 
maxim, that the qualities of an atom — as, for in- 
stance, the colour or taste of earth m its atomic 
character — are incapable of being so cognized . 1 It 
is, however, a fact of universal consciousness, that 
the qualities of the soul are cognized immediately; 
and hence the pundits are compelled, on their princi- 
ples, to regard the soul as of infinite dimension. 
The reply which I gave at the end of the last para- 
graph is equally applicable in this place. 

Another relevant objection that would offer itself 
to the pundits, is this. 1 If the soul be not all- 
pervading, but bounded by the body, it must vary in 
dimension as the body varies: and the same soul 
may, in one state of existence, inform an ant; in 
another, a human being; and, in a third, an elephant. 
Assuming the soul to be bounded by the body, it 
must be very minute in an ant; and, when it passes 
into a man, or into an elephant, how can it discharge

atomic in dimension, and since grossness is essential m order

A further objection, and one more ordinarily urged, against 
the hypothetical notion, that the soul is of atomic bulk, will 
be found in the words of the Sankhya and Va&eshika writers 
adduced in the second note forward.

its functions? 1 And how can it take cognizance 
of the sense of feeling throughout such a bulk? 
Eor it cannot dilate so as to fill it. 2 We must con- 
clude, consequently, that the soul increases and 
diminishes with the increase and diminution of the 
body. And since, thus, from repeatedly increasing 
and diminishing, it undergoes alteration of constituent

body — were, by a special maturation of works, to be born an 
elephant, it would fall short of filling the whole of an elephan- 
tine body , and, if horn a bee, an apian body would be inadequate 
to contain it.’

of the text, in opposition to the view, that the soul is atomic.

parts, it follows, that it must repeatedly be gene- 
rated and destroyed . for to undergo such alteration 
is, according to the Naiyayikas, to be generated after 
having been destroyed*’ 

Now, for my part, I repudiate the notion of metem- 
psychosis ; and so I might hold myself dispensed 
here from returning answer to the pundits. Neverthe- 
less, I reply to them ; since the objection just detailed 
will recur, A human being has, in infancy, a body 
of small size as compared with what that body becomes 
subsequently. They will say, then, that, on my view 
of the soul’s being bounded by the body, it must be, 
that the small soul of the infant becomes a large soul 
in the full-grown man ; for the small soul of a small 
body could not take cognizance of the sense of feeling, , 
for instance, from head to foot of a body greatly 
augmented in magnitude . 1 To this I say, that, though 
one holds the soul to be bounded by the body, still it 
does not follow, of course, as an article of belief, that, 
in proportion as the body changes in size, so does 
the soul. When a child begins to grow, the appre- 
hension and other faculties of his soul increase in 
strength ; but it is not necessary to say, that his soul 
itself augments. And, when I allege, that the soul 
is bounded by the body, my meaning is not, that its 

1 Such an objection is brought by Sankara Jcharya in con- 
tinuation of his words quoted in the note before the last : U'RH

same objection applies even to the case of a state of existence 
taken by itself, in its several stages of childhood, middle age,, 
and senescence. 7 



172 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

dimension tallies exactly with that of the body, I 
simply intend, that the soul does not reside beyond 
the body. As for its nature, that is most hard to 
understand ; and no one, in fact, can give a full 
description of it. That the soul takes cognizance of 
the sense of touch in all the parts of a body, small 
or great, is nothing difficult to it; for, in its opera- 
tions, it subsidizes all the sense-organs ; and its power 
of apprehension is more or less in proportion to the 
vigour of those organs. Thus, a man whose sight is 
impaired sees ill ; and, when it is improved, he sees 
better. In like manner, tact is apprehended through 
"the nerves; and these increase with the body; and, 
through them, there is apprehension of tact through- 
out the parts of the body, whether it be small or 
great. 

The truth is, that the nature of the soul transcends 
■our knowledge, and does not lend itself to description. 
All that we know of the soul is, that it is something 
which possesses apprehension, will, and other qualities. 
More than this we cannot affirm concerning it ; as, 
for instance, that, like earth, water, and other material 
substances, it has dimension and such like qualities. 
Much, therefore, that is predicable of a jar, of cloth, 
and of other material substances, is nob to be predi- 
cated of the soul. Such, however, is the disposition 
-of the pundits, that they refuse to consider what 
things are within the reach of our understanding, 
and what things lie beyond. They would fain to take 
'the visible and the invisible, God and souls included, 
and measure them, and turn them round and over, 
:and pry into them, and at last get their complete

quiddities inside their fist. To their minds, if one is 
to know anything, one should know everything ; 
otherwise, it is better to know nothing. And so they 
wander on in the wilderness of vain inquiry. I would 
remind them, that, be the essence of the soul of what 
sort soever, its origin, duration, and end are in sub- 
ordination to the will of God ; and, therefore, if God 
thinks good that the soul shall exist for ever, it can 
in no wise incur destruction. 

But the weightiest reason, in the estimation of the 
pundits, for arguing, that the soul has existed from 
all eternity, is as follows. First, they argue, that the 
doctrine of metempsychosis must be accepted. Other- 
wise, the imputation of partiality and cruelty must 
attach to God. Partiality consists in not looking 
upon all alike ; in treating some with more favour, 
and others with less ; in giving some a high rank, 
and others a low T er. Cruelty is uncompassionateness ; 
the giving pain where no fafult has been committed. 
Now, we see, that, in this world, some enjoy a high 
rank and great power,* and others are wretched, and 
afflicted with poverty: and what is the reason, that 
God has ordered it thus ? Again, almost all men suffer 
misery and misfortune ; and what is the cause of this ? 
It is not enough to say, it is the sins that have been 
done in the current state of existence ; for it is matter 
of experience, that many a grievous offender has great 
power and pleasure, and that many a man whose 
conduct is observably meritorious is oppressed with 
poverty and pain. And what can you say with respect 
to infants and beasts? Consciously they have never 
committed sin; and yet they suffer greatly. Hence, 



m THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

we maintain the doctrine of the transmigration of the 
soul, and so remove all these difficulties. We can, 
therefore, say, when we see a bad man to be powerful 
and in comfort, that he must have been eminently 
virtuous in a former state of existence, and is now 
reaping the reward of his virtue. Similarly, when we 
see a good man suffer more than ordinary affliction, 
we are able to affirm, that, in a former state of existence 
he was eminently sinful, and is now receiving retribu- 
tion for his sm. And, in like manner, infants and 
beasts undergo punishment for the offences of which, 
in a prior birth, they were guilty. A single former 
state of being will not suffice, however ; as the good 
and evil experienced therein must likewise be accounted 
for by the works of a birth that preceded. Moreover, 
the getting a body is also a consequence of works ; 1 
and, therefore, as often as a soul is invested in a body, 
antecedent works must be postulated in connexion 
with it. We hold, therefore, that the vicissitude of 
works and births, the alternate production of each 
from the other, has been going on from time without 
beginning.

I reply, that, neither by this reasoning can the soul 
be proved never to have originated. Even if I ad- 
mitted the truth of what you have alleged touching 
the present facility of some bad men, etc,, and 
metempsychosis as an explanation thereof, still I should 
not feel myself under any compulsion to argue, that 
souls have always existed, and that birth and death 
have had place from a foregone eternity. The diffi- 
culties above mentioned would all be repelled, if it 
were maintained, that, in the beginning, souls were 
created by God ; originally in a state of happiness, but 
condemned, by reason of sin, to repeated embodiment. 
But to say, as you do, that works must be taken 
to have been done prior to the body— for that the 
hfVing a body is the consequence of works — is in 
the last degree unreasonable. Your maxim, that every 
•effect must have for its cause the works of souls, 
I have previously exploded ; for effects follow from 
free will of God. But the pundits say, that the body 
is intrinsically an abode or site of misery , 1 and hence 
is itself a misery. Out of the twenty and one mis- 
eries enumerated by the Naiyayikas, this is one. If, 
then, God invests a soul with a body, irrespectively 
of works, He does injustice. My reply is, that the 
body is not, intrinsically, an abode of misery. On the

176 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

contrary, not a little happiness is derived by means of 
it ; and, as for the pain caused by the body, owing 
to illness, etc., it is in the power of God to remove 
it. If He so willed, He might preserve us constantly 
at ease, though in the body. How crude here also 
is the reasoning of the pundits ! Those who follow 
the Nyaya and Vaiseshika, hold, that God exists. 
Still, when they argue upon other points than His 
existence, they seem to forget that He exists, and* 
as it were, refer all things to a law of chance. 
Eor the ground of their doctrine, that misery inevi- 
tably accompanies the body, is, that they everywhere 
see such to be the fact ; and hence they infer, that 
it is its nature to be so accompanied, and that God 
could not make it to be otherwise. In like mamer 
do they err in their maxim, that nothing which has 
had a beginning can be indestructible. Thus to 
think will be made out to be proper, when we are 
convinced, that the course of nature is fortuitous, 
and subject to some blind law. If, however, God 
is Governor of the course of nature, all things spring 
from His will. Some things are perishable, because 
He wills them to be so ; and, for the same reason, 
other things are imperishable. In like manner, we 
men suffer misery, because it has been decreed fit, 
in His unfathomable and incomprehensible counsel, 
that thus it should be. If He thought good, it 
would not be at all difficult for Him to cause, that, 
though clothed with bodies, we should constantly 
remain happy. Indeed, it is manifest, from the true 
word of God, that, when man was in a state of 
smlessness, he was entirely exempt from misery. 



SOUL 


177 


Neither did sickness, nor sorrow, nor death befall him ; 
nay, the body was, to him, a door to many felicities. 
Only since he became a sinner has he been subject 
to the countless griefs of the soul and of the body. 
Earth, water, air, and all other external objects, 
were, in the beginning, sources, to him, of happi- 
ness only, and afterwards became sources of misery. 
The doctrine, therefore, of the pundits, that to abide 
in the body is intrinsically misery, is in every wise 
erroneous. 

The refutation which I have detailed, of the notion 
of an unoriginated succession of works and births 
of souls, has proceeded on grounds maintained by 
my opponents, Tor, as regards myself, I reject the 
doctrine of metempsychosis ; and I account as inade- 
quate all the reasons that they bring forward in 
support of it. 1 With respect to the first defect 
which, according to them, has place, if metempsychosis 
be rejected, namely, partiality in God, I reply thus. 
If you simply mean, that He has not bestowed upon 

i This argument against the metempsychosis, however drawn 
out, will not seem to be gratuitously diffuse, if one but takes 
these three facts into consideration : first, that the doctrine 
here impeached is all but ineradicably rooted in the mind of 
every pundit ; secondly, that, in the estimation of the pundits, 
any religious economy which does not acknowledge it is almost 
self-evidently false in its very first principles ; and thirdly, and 
by way of consequence, that the rejection of it by Christianity 
is, to them, a wellnigh insuperable obstacle to their accept- 
ance of the Gospel. The writer, in here combating a favourite 
and fundamental dogma, has with his best thought and diligence, 
selected and marshalled his reasons in such a manner as is, 
he apprehends, best calculated to impress the minds of his 
erring countrymen, and to win them towards the truth* 

12 



178 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

all men equality of rank and happiness, your objection 
has no weight with me: since I hold, that it was to 
show forth His all-sufficient attributes, that God framed 
the world; and that He creates souls irrespectively 
of works ; and that He makes them diverse, as ex- 
hibiting the manifold ness of His creation. Tor in- 
stance, there are souls of one kind, in the form of 
angels, who surpass man, by far, in rank, majesty, 
wisdom, power, and other particulars. Inferior to 
them is man; and, again, below him are other crea- 
tures, such as beasts. These varieties we know of; 
but who shall say how many more different grades 
there may not be in God’s vast universe? Again, 
there are distinct orders of angels ; and of mankind 
also the ranks are numerous. All alike are the ora- 
tion of God’s free will; and, if He has given a high 
place to one, and a humble place to another, has 
any one a claim on Him ? If we, who were once 
nothing, have, on receiving existence, been given 
anything whatever, it is from God’s mere mercy. 
And can this mercy become injustice, from His 
giving another more than He gives me ? If any one 
gives a poor man ten rupees, the man thinks himself 
greatly indebted to the giver. But, if the donor 
gives a hundred rupees to another poor man, does 
his favour towards the first turn to no favour ? Does 
he prove himself unjust? I am aware, that, our 
nature having become corrupted by sin, almost any 
man, if he sees that others are favoured beyond 
himself, takes it ill, and is jealous and unhappy. 
But this unhappiness arises from the fact, that his 
nature is corrupt; and there is no right ground for 



SOUL 


179 


it. There is no injustice, then, in giving less to 
one, and more to another. If, indeed, all had a 
claim to receive equally, there would be injustice. 
No one, however, has any claim upon God. 

But now you may say, that, though there is no 
injustice in bestowing mean rank or small power on 
one, and high rank or great power on another, yet is 
there not injustice in causing pain gratuitously ? And 
how many great sinners are happy, and how many 
good men are miserable 1 As for infants and beasts, 
too, who have never sinned, do not they suffer much 
affliction ? Pray, how are these things to be accounted 
for? I reply. Without doubt, the fruit of sin is 
misery; and, as all men are sinners, it is meet, that, 
being so, they should be miserable. There are some 
men whom we call good, but, in the sight of God, 
they are all guilty , for God and man behold things 
under very different aspects. From sm, the discern- 
ment of man has become blunted ; and the heinous- 
ness of sin is not altogether clear to him. Some men 
are called good, simply because they are better than 
most others. And yet there is not, in all the world, 
even one man whose heart and nature are undefiled 
by sin. Those, therefore, whom we call good are, 
before a most holy God, guilty, and deserving of 
punishment. 

Moreover, mark, that this world is not man's place 
of judgement. Full judgement will not be till after 
death; and not till then will each receive exact and 
complete requital for his deeds. The present world, 
like a school, is a place where man is disciplined ; and 
the happiness or misery which we here experience is 



180 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


not always by way of requital, or, when so, propor- 
tioned to our actions. In most cases, God sends 
happiness and misery to men, as being calculated for 
their good; but, to us, it is impossible to decide 
what is for any one’s good, or the reverse. For none 
of us can know another’s heart and nature, and his 
history, past, present, and future, and the eventual 
result of his happiness or misery. Should we, then, 
pronounce all misery in this world to be evil, we 
should err greatly. We ought, rather, to consider 
misery to be sent to us, in this world, by God, in 
mercy, for our warning, that we may turn to Him, 
and so escape future punishment. Therefore, to 
entertain doubt as to God’s justice, because of the 
distresses of this world, is most rash. If a man who 
has been blindly walking in the path of sin, has his 
heart opened by some great calamity, and takes warning, 
repents, and turns to God, must he not look upon 
that calamity as a great blessing from God ; and will 
he not praise God for it all his life long ? 

And do not suppose, that men of proper life and 
of amiable disposition have no need of the discipline 
which is furnished by misery. They too commit 
many an error, and have many a defect. And often 
it so occurs, that he who is a chosen servant of God 
is especially visited with affliction, not for punish- 
ment, but to the end, that he may be tried, like gold, 
in the crucible of misery, and thereby be purified. 
What folly, then, to let the idea of evil be suggested, 
whenever one hears the name of misery, and, with 
pne’s feeble intellect, to decide as to its hidden 
causes l 



SOUL 


181 


It is often wondered, why, if there was no former 
state of existence, some persons are born blind, and 
others are born lame. God has made many men thus, 
while he has made many of whole body. And it is 
asked, whether there be not partiality in this. But 
what are we, to attempt to find out the secret counsel 
of God ! Can we learn the heart, and nature, and all 
the external and internal condition of another? Who 
shall say what good may not accrue to the immortal 
souls of the lame and blind, from their few days of 
misery ? It is very true, that, though God, in His 
great mercy, sends us various remedial miseries for 
the eternal benefit of our souls, still, so infatuated are 
we with sin, that most of us refuse to take warning 
fmm our misery, and to repent of our sins, and to 
turn to God. The fault is our own, however. As for 
God's dealing, it is mercy. Is it not written even in 
one of the books of Hindus, ‘ From him whom I would 
favour, by little and little do I take away the 
riches ’ ? 1 

It remains for me to speak of the misery of infants 
and beasts. And here, entering upon a strict logical 
argument, I would ask the Hindu: Is it certain, that 
the suffering of souls can have no just cause but 
their offences? When a man commits a great state- 
crime, the king has him executed, and confiscates his 
property* As a consequence, and even though they 
may have taken no part in the crime, his children 
and household are involved in extreme distress. But 

1 rfa ffoq aip 51$: 1 

This half-couplet is from the Bhdgavata-^urana ) x. 88, 8. 



182 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

does any one, for this, call the king unjust ? Or take 
this case. The king's subjects are in every way loyal, 
and their sovereign is perfectly satisfied with them. 
But an enemy comes to attack him. He orders his 
people to give him their aid ; and thousands of them 
suffer greatly, or are slain, and that, although they 
have not offended against their lord, but, on the 
contrary, have always obeyed him. Now tell me, 
whether the king did any injustice m sending them 
to war. Take a third illustration. A king entrusted 
his son to a pundit, to be instructed. The pundit was 
very learned and expert; and the prince, on his part, 
was of a good disposition, laborious, and heedful of 
his teacher's directions. The teacher initiated him in 
every branch of learning. When the prince became 
a thorough scholar, the pundit took him to the king, 
whom he addressed as follows : ‘ Sire, I have taught 
your son all things but one. That one thing is most 
necessary, in my opinion ; but I cannot teach it to 
him, till I have your promise of pardon.’ * Why do 
you speak thus ? * replied the king. * In securing 
your services, I count myself most fortunate ; and I 
made over my son to you; and I am sure, that what- 
ever you propose to do must be for his good.' £ Very 
well,' said the pundit, ‘ let a horse be saddled.’ When 
the horse was brought, the pundit mounted, and called 
out to the prince. The prince drew near ; upon which 
the pundit laid his whip over him smartly, and spurred 
on his horse, telling the prince to run along with him. 
The king, seeing this, was at his wits' e‘nds, hastened 
after the pundit, and begged him to tell what it all 
meant. The pundit reined in his horse, and thus made 



SOUL 


183 


answer, ‘ Pardon me, Sire, for what I have done. I 
wish only good to your son; and, in my opinion, it 
was most necessary to teach him the one thing I have 
now taught him. For he is a prince; and he was 
altogether ignorant of the pain of being beaten and of 
violent exertion. He knew it only by name, as he 
had never tasted it. On coming to the throne, how 
could he have realized the sufferings of others ? And, 
if any one offended, how, when awarding punishment 
to him, could the thought have presented itself to his 
mind, of leaning to tenderness and to mercy? These 
attributes are, however, necessary to a good king ; and 
what I have done was done with a view that he might 
not be without them.' Now, observe, that the prince 
Hid done no wrong in his relations with the pundit ; 
and yet no one would charge the pundit with doing 
injustice in occasioning him pain. And, if a foolish 
man, ignorant of the pundit’s motive, on seeing this 
strange scene from a distance, had said to himself, 
that either the prince must have been guilty of some 
grave fault, or else the pundit was most unjust, what 
rashness and want of consideration would such an 
inference have manifested ! But do not understand me to 
mean, that the actions of the king and of the teacher, 
in these illustrations, afford exact parallels to the 
ways of God; or that the subjects, whose misery 
was caused by their king, and the situation of the 
prince, are altogether like the condition of infants 
and beasts ; or that the fruit of the misery of them 
all is of the same character. I pray you not thus 
to misapprehend me; for it often happens, in contro- 
versy, that from not seizing the drift of one’s opponent, 



184 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

one takes words that fall from him, otherwise than 
as he intended them, and then blames him for opinions 
which he does not entertain. Do not deal by me in 
this way. Understand, that my design, in adducing 
these illustrations, is simply to refute the notion of 
its being an established fact, that, when misery befalls 
any one, it must be referred to his offences against 
the author of his suffering, and admits of no other 
explanation. [ have only wished to show the base- 
lessness of this your maxim. The inference of a former 
state of existence, in the case of children, from observ- 
ing that they experience suffering, can have no ground 
but that maxim; and, if the maxim is shown to' be 
false, the inference built upon it is so likewise. As 
for the illustrations of the king and pundit, perhaps 
you will allege, that they do not go to disprove your 
maxim, that suffering presupposes sin ; inasmuch as, 
according to your system, the persons who, though 
they had not offended against the king and the pundit, 
suffered pain from them, received therein the retribu- 
tion of sins done in a former birth; and so their 
offences are made out to have been the cause of their 
pain, and your maxim stands intact. I have to reply, 
.that you have not exactly taken in the intent of my 
illustrations. If the persons in question had sinned 
in a former birth, they must have been offenders in 
the sight of God. What I meant was, that they bad 
not offended against the king and the pundit; and 
yet the king and the pundit, though bringing suffering 
on them, cannot be called unjust. If there could be 
;no proper reason, other than offences against the 
Mausers of suffering, for causing suffering to others, 



SOUL 


185 


the king and the pundit were certainly unjust. When 
any one, without due cause, brings about the death of 
another, even then, suitably to your view, he who 
dies reaps, in his death, the fruit of the sins of a fore- 
gone birth : and is the person who took his life, on 
that account, guiltless ? In conclusion, my illustrations 
certainly prove, that there may be an adequate cause, 
other than offences against him who inflicts suffering, to 
which suffering may be referred ; and, by consequence, 
your maxim is baseless. 

As concerns the fearful punishment which every 
evil-doer must suffer in the world to come, that maxim 
is, indeed, correct ; but there is no satisfactory and 
convincing proof of it with reference to the frivolous 
distresses we suffer in this transitory life. Be assured, 
also, that tbe sufferings of infants and beasts, though 
to the onlooker they seem terrible, are very trivial in 
comparison with those of a person of full conscious- 
ness ; for we know, with certainty, that, the less the 
consciousness, the less the pain. In fact, very likely 
a father and mother, when they see their infant in 
pain, suffer more than the infant itself. As for its 
pain, though we may see no fruit coming from it now, 
still you may be sure, that God sent it for some most 
good and salutary end ; such an end, that, when it 
becomes known to us, we shall confess, that the misery 
from the pain is of no account whatever, as weighed 
against the consequent benefit. 

Again, we learn, from tbe true word of God, 
that the chief and primary cause of the entrance 
of pain into this world was sin ; and that all 
misery has immediate or mediate connexion with 



186 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

man’s bad deeds, or with his evil nature, which 
is the seed of ill-doing. Nevertheless, I affirm, that, 
so deep and so far transcending understanding are 
the ways of Almighty God, and in such a manner 
does He, in His inscrutable wisdom, educe various 
results from every single thing He does, that, 
assuredly, we cannot say, when a soul receives 
pain in this world, that such pain can have no 
just cause but in the sin that soul has committed. 
Many and many a just cause may it have, of which 
our feeble understanding can know nothing. How 
hasty is it, therefore, for us, when we contemplate the 
sufferings of beasts, or of children, or of any other 
creature, to make up our minds, forthwith, that they had 
a former birth, and that they were then guilty of sir?! 
To establish such strange doctrines, satisfactory and 
convincing evidence is necessary. It is manifest, that 
metempsychosis is most improbable. Hindus, because 
they have constantly heard of it from their childhood, 
look upon it as not improbable. Still, in reality, it 
is exceedingly improbable ; and it does not deserve 
instant credit, that we have been in existence, times 
innumerable, and from duration without beginning, as 
gods, men, elephants, horses, dogs, cats, monkeys, 
mice, scorpions, and centipedes. What scenes we must 
have passed through, of which we have not, now, 
even the faintest remembrance ! If it be replied, that, 
as we who are grown up have forgot many circum- 
stances of our childhood and adolescence, so we have 
forgot the circumstances of our former births, I would 
ask, whether, in those so many births, we were always 
like children. Moreover, though we forget many thinge 



SOUL 


187 


that passed in our adolescence, there are thou- 
sands of other things, belonging to that stage of life, 
which remain in our memories all our lives long. 
Should it be replied, that, not altogether inconceivably, 
at the time of each new birth, we must forget the 
transactions of the former birth, I assent. But there 
are many things that are not altogether impossible, 
which, yet, we are unable at once to believe. Is it 
wholly impossible, that wings should sprout out of an 
elephant, and that he should soar up into the clouds ? 
At the same time, if any one should come and tell us, 
that he had seen such a thing, we should scarcely 
credit him off hand. Only on his producing the most 
indubitable evidence of the truth of what he was 
averting, should we believe him ; not otherwise. Bor, 
in proportion as a thing is extraordinary, we require 
strong proof of it. And, inasmuch as metempsychosis 
is in the highest degree improbable, and is supported 
by no satisfactory and convincing evidence, I cannot 
accept it; your maxim, that suffering presupposes sin, 
and cannot else be accounted for, being altogether 
impotent. In my foregoing illustrations I have shown, 
that suffering may have other just causes. Consider, 
too, that the king and the pundit, in those illustrations, 
are infinitely surpassed, by the Deity, in amplitude 
and profundity of counsel. Where there is one reason 
to justify an act of a king, who can say how many 
there may not be to justify any one act of God ? Can 
you, indeed, find out the whole mind of God, and 
say, with assurance, in respect of any particular, that 
such or such is the cause of it, and that it can have 
no other cause ? Countless are the things in this world. 



188 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

of which we cannot in the least discover the purpose : 
and will you therefore conclude, that they exist without 
a purpose? Who can tell the bounds of God’s wide 
and complicated universe ? And, as for the innumerable 
things which constitute it, who can point out the hidden 
cause of each, or its result, or its countless relations 
to other things? God, keeping in view all this, created 
the whole, and controls it. Of this whole we see 
but a very small portion of a part; and yet, when 
anything in it seems otherwise than suits us, we 
begin to raise objections to it. But God, who beholds 
all, and who knows how everything in it relates to 
everything else, and the result of each thing, and 
what consequences will finally flow from all things 
taken collectively, knows, that whatever He has matJe 
is in every wise good, and is assigned to its proper 
place. 

When a cultivator casts his precious seed into the 
dust, and presses it down, if a foolish man were to 
ask him why he was destroying it, would he not 
smile, and tell him to wait a little, and he would 
see, that the seed had not been destroyed, but would 
turn to great profit ? Be advised, that, in like manner, 
God has made this world for some most excellent 
end. At present, we are unable to perceive what it 
is; and some things seem to us to be reversed, and 
others to be useless, and even wrong. The laws by 
which God governs the world, and His reasons for 
them, are so deep, that not only we, but even the 
angels, stand confounded before them. The founda- 
tions of His counsel have been laid in time that had 
no beginning; and its pinnacle, so to speak, pierces 



SOUL 


189 


the remotest futurity. Know, however, of a surety, 
that all things will conspire to a final result, such as 
shall make manifest His supereminent glory and His 
supremely love-worthy attributes. 

But the pundits do not take these things into their 
consideration. Ml the actions and plans of God they 
treat as if they were those of a man. They cannot 
realize, that the counsels and the ways of God are 
far beyond our understanding — so far beyond it, that, 
search as we may, we can never find them out. 
Nor can they believe, that there are, in God's world, 
things past computation, of which we know not the 
causes, and of which there are, nevertheless, numerous 
and just causes, known to God. And hence they 
would settle everything by their own poor judgement ; 
and hence they arbitrarily postulate maxims and 
dogmas. In this lies the root of all their errors. Be 
persuaded, I entreat you, to quit this most faulty 
method. If you learn the right method, you shall 
never go astray. When you have to reason on any 
matter pertaining to God, first of all consider what 
things are within the scope of our understanding ; and 
reason on them alone. As for what transcends our 
understanding, to be silent regarding it, is a token 
of wisdom. Who knows but God has kept back from 
us the causes of many things in His creation, ex- 
pressly with a view to teach us humility, and to 
discipline our faith in Him? Indeed, a chief mark of 
piety is this: that, though many things relating to 
God seem to us not only to have no obvious causes, 
but even — such is our short sight— -to be improper, 
we should yet bow our heads, and confess, with 



190 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

unwavering faith, that they are all most excellent and 
right. In so doing, our humility and the firmness 
of our faith are put to the test. When a given thing 
is referred to God, we must first ascertain, whether 
it be correctly so referred : if correctly, of course our 
humble belief in it is justified. Such belief is not, 
however, binding upon us with regard to what is 
written of God in your Vedas and Puranas; for it is 
not proved, that what is there said of God belongs 
to Him. On the contrary, thousands of proofs render 
it most indubitable, that those books were the inven- 
tion of men. Whatever things we see before us in 
God’s creation — the sufferings of children, for instance, 
— are from God, without doubt; and these, as I have 
said, we are to believe, with humility, to be mtfSt 
excellent and right. 

The Naiyayika dogma of the existence of the soul 
from eternity appears, further, as a great error, in 
that it detracts from the real relation in which the 
soul stands to God, and from the consequent duties 
which it owes to God. If I believe, that God created 
both my soul and body, and that my continuance in 
life, and whatever I have, are from Him, I must 
regard Him as having complete authority over me ; 
and it is seen to be my duty to love and to honour 
Him with all my soul and strength, and to remain 
entirely His. But, if a man believes that his soul 
is self-existent, and that whatever he receives from 
God is the fruit of his own works, he must consider 
God’s authority over his soul to be very partial; and, 
as a result, the duty of his soul to love and to honour 
God must likewise be partial.

Examination of the Cause , laid down in the Nyffya , 
Vaiseshiha , and the other Systems , 0/ the Wretched- 
ness of the Soul , Bondage , and the 

Means of escaping therefrom ; a Succinct Descrip- 
tion of the True Nature of Virtue and Vice ; 
a Criticism of the Vieivs of the Systematists 
touching Virtue and Vice , their Consequences , 

Now, other things with which we ought to acquaint 
ourselves are, the wretchedness of the soul, the cause 
of this wretchedness, and the means of getting rid of 
it. On these topics there are very many errors in 
what we find in the Nyaya, Vaiseshika, and others 
among the Systems. All the Systematists concede, 
that all men are wretched; their wretchedness con- 
sisting in metempsychosis and the resultant suffering. 
It is not this, in my belief, that constitutes man’s 
wretchedness; and yet his real wretchedness is far 
more terrible than any of that nature. But this point 
I will not pursue. Let me ask the Systematists, what 
is the cause of human wretchedness. They allege, 
that it is misapprehension— the identifying oneself 
with one’s body and so forth. And, if I wish to know 
what harm, in their opinion, comes of this, they tell 



192 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

me, that the identifying the body with the soul origi- 
nates desire and aversion, from which spring good 
and evil works, whence arise merit and demerit, to 
reap the fruits of which follow repeated births, Elysium, 
Hell, happiness, and misery; and that such is human 
wretchedness. All this wretchedness they think the 
soul can escape from, and then be liberated, on its 
coming to know itself to be diverse from the body, 
etc. A full account of this has been given in the 
second chapter of the first section. All the dogmas 
of the Systematists on this topic contain grave errors ; 
and I shall consider those dogmas, one by one, in 
the present chapter. The matter before us, I implore 
the reader to remember, is most concerning. It is to 
the salvation of our priceless souls that it relates ; aUd 
it should be pondered with freedom from partiality, 
and with patience and fixedness of attention. 

There must be very few who regard the body and 
soul as altogether one. In general, men know and 
believe, that the soul, which is intelligent, and the 
body, which is unintelligent, are of different substances. 
All men, however, you declare, m saying ‘ I am dark 
or * I am fair evidence, that they labour under mis- 
apprehension. I reply, that such locations * do not 
betoken misapprehension, Por, though the soul and 
the body are different as to substance, yet God has 
established so close a connexion between them, that, 
as it were, the two make up one, and we call both 
together man. When, therefore, a man says * I he 
does not mean his soul only ; nor does he mean Ms 
body only ; but the two. He may predicate of himself 
things which pertain solely to the body, as when he 



SOUL 


193 


says, ‘ I am dark, or fair ' ; and so of things 'which 
belong only to the soul, as when he says, ‘ I am 
conscious, or ignorant ’ ; but this does not prove him 
unaware, that his soul is distinct from his body. It 
is true, that a man sometimes seems to identify his 
wealth, or the like, with himself, and, when he loses 
his property, says, ‘ I am lost \ l But does any one 
really believe, that; a man who so expresses himself 
actually regards his property as one with his soul ? 2 
And again, since, of the body and soul, the soul is 
chief and the more excellent, a man sometimes speaks 
as though he were soul only, as when he says, f my 
body or ‘ I shall leave the body \ Baseless, therefore, 
is the opinion of those who maintain, on the ground 
of*such phrases as * I am black’, and ‘ I am fair’, that 
men labour under great misapprehension — a misap- 
prehension which gives rise to all their wretchedness. 

Again, though some men may be so ignorant as to 
identify the soul and body, still, they are not enabled, 
by being taught their separateness, to escape from 
good and bad works. The pundits, hovrever, may 
argue , 3 that a conviction of their separateness is 
necessarily operative of such escape. ‘ For, when a man 

1 The sense of the original has here been preserved at the 
cost of compromising idiom. 

2 It is singular, that the pundits adduce locutions similar to 
those in the text, to prove the direct opposite. When, they 
allege, a man whose son is prosperous says, ‘ I am prosperous 

it is proved, that the man, through ignorance, regards himself 
as strictly and in fact identical with his son. See the Vedanta- 
Sara, p, li ; and the extract from Sankara Acharya, at p. 10. 

3 This argument has not been met with ; nor does the author 
suppose that a pundit would be likely, to employ it. It has 

13 



194 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

knows, that bis soul is separate from his body, he 
must also believe, that the soul will not perish with 
the body, but will continue to exist after death, and 
will receive the requital of its good or evil works. 
And, when he reflects, that, in order to receive such 
requital, he must fall into Hell, or go to Elysium ; 
and that even the happiness of Elysium is alloyed by 
various kinds of misery ; and that, after all, when his 
desert is exhausted, the very happiness which was 
enjoyed becomes a source of misery ; and that succes- 
sive births and deaths must follow, and various sorts 
of happiness and misery be experienced; how great 
is the wretchedness ! And, when, from heed to the 
numerous admonitions of the scriptures, the vanity of 
all the happiness of this world and of the next becoifl^s 
dear to him, he will assuredly grow averse from both 
virtue and vice, and will estrange himself equally 
from good works and from evil.’ I reply, that the 
expectation of his doing so is vain. As I have said 
already, the generality of men know, that the soul 
is distinct, from the body. Interrogate even a very 
ignorant man, and he will tell you, that he looks to 
receiving, after death, the fruit of his deeds. But does 
this prospect keep him from good and evil works? 
Perhaps you will say, that the ignorant are, indeed, 
informed about this matter, but do not seriously reflect 
upon it; and hence they do not rid themselves of 

been brought forward, and answered, to meet possible contin- 
gencies. The Hindu theory is, that the intuition of the soul’s 
separateness from the body and so forth, has the effect of 
extirpating desire and aversion, and so of conducing to emanci- 
pation. See p. 35, sey. 



VIBTUE AND VICE 


195 


desire and aversion. If, nevertheless, they received 
instruction, and meditated on the subject, why would 
they not so rid themselves? To this I have to say, 
that it becomes evident, if we thoroughly study the 
condition of human nature, that no labour such as 
you have spoken of is enough to root out desire and 
aversion altogether. And here I must observe, that, 
to count both good works and evil works a cause of 
bondage is, to my mind, wholly wrong. A little further 
on I shall expose the error of the pundits on this point. 
As for evil works, they are really a cause of bondage. 
Most necessary is it to avoid them ; and even the 
consideration of the future punishment which they 
entail ought to induce men to avoid them. But, alas 1 
SO corrupt is the nature of man, that, let him reflect 
however much, yet he cannot, on that account, abandon 
bad works entirely. Your solicitude to shun good 
works is quite superfluous ; for, so corrupt is the nature 
of man, that, let his works be ever so good, still there 
cleaves to them much of evil and imperfection; and 
he is incapable of a single good work wrought with 
purity of body, speech, and heart. For good works, 
a man may receive praise from his fellow-men; but, 
in the sight of God, who knows everything without 
and within, these very works are tainted with evil. 
Know, then, that miserable man of himself forbears 
good works: there is no need of pointing out the 
way to avoid them. But to escape from evil works is 
impossible by any human device. Suppose that one 
avoids practical theft, murder, adultery, contention* 
injustice, and so forth : yet is this the avoidance of all 
evil works? Not at all. The whole duty of man 



196 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

consists in two things : to love God with all his hearty 
soul, and strength ; and to love his fellow-men as he 
loves himself. To do contrariwise, or to do less, is 
sin. He who does his whole duty must never offend 
in either of the two things I have specified. And who 
can thus never offend? Most men are unaware of 
their secret faults, which lie hidden from them ; and, 
on the ground of certain visible good works, they 
hug themselves on their goodness. But, if a man 
habitually explores, with the lamp of discrimination, 
that gloomy crypt, the dark dungeon of his heart, 
and looks into all the corners, and weighs all his 
thoughts, words, and deeds, he perceives, all too 
plainly, that he is a vile, fallen, weak, and helpless 
singer. Countless are the instances of secret pricfb, 
hypocrisy, deceit, selfishness, and other blemishes, 
not to be described, that he will discover in himself ; 
and the conviction will be forced upon him, that he 
does not love God as he ought. Such is the state 
of man. And be assured, that no man will be saved 
by right apprehension, or by works, but only by 
the free grace of God, the means of obtaining which 
are indicated in the real word of God. 

Again, you yourselves acknowledge, that even he 
who has attained to fulness of right apprehension — 
whom you call saved-in-life — goes on, so long as he 
is in the body, doing good and bad works; for you 
bold that the accumulated works of the rightly 
apprehensive man are destroyed, and that his current 
Works are inoperative. By this it is proved, that he 
floes works which, but for his right apprehension, 
would have produced merit and demerit— that is to say. 



VIRTUE AND VICE 


197 


good works and bad. How, then, is it established, 
that misapprehension is the cause of all works ? 
And what turns out to be the difference between a 
man of right apprehension and one of wrong appre- 
hension? You may allege, that there is this great 
difference, that the good and evil works of the 
misapprehensive man serve to fetter him, and that the 
rightly apprehensive man cannot be fettered by his 
works. The fallacy of this I shall lay bare in due 
course. 

Another, and a greater, error on this point, into 
which the Systematists fall, is, in saying that virtue 
itself enthrals the soul. Vice does so, to be sure; 
but how can virtue? The fact is, that the System- 
afcists do not understand aright the nature of virtue 
and that of vice ; and on this account they go 
astray so variously. This being the case, I shall 
first briefly set forth the true nature of virtue and 
that of vice, and then treat of the errors just ad- 
verted to. 

God created man a moral creature ; capable of 
knowing God, and his own relations to God and the 
world; and capable of honouring and of loving God, 
his Creator and Lord, and of discharging his duties 
towards his fellow-creatures. And this capacity also 
he possesses, of knowing, that to do these things is 
right, and that to do the reverse is wrong. By a 
moral creature I mean one who answers this descrip- 
tion. And now understand, that, man being a moral 
creature, certain things, in respect of bis rank and 
nature, are, of themselves, binding on him, such as 
devotion, justice, truth, compassion, and the like; 



198 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

while other things are, of themselves, wrong for him,, 
snch as atheism, injury to others, uncompassion, 
falsehood, and so forth. The former are virtue, and 
the latter are vice. Now, God, in His essential 
character, is good and just. Consequently, any action 
proper for man is, in itself, pleasing to Him; and 
any that is improper is displeasing to Him : and, in- 
asmuch as He is just by nature, He must show 
favour to the virtuous, and award punishment to the 
wicked. 

Three points are to be kept in view. Eirst, God 
has not established, without cause and at haphazard, 
the distinction between virtue and vice ; but He has 
fixed that to be virtue, which is binding on men with 
respect to their nature and rank, and that to be vicey 
which is wrong for them. Hence, in no circumstances 
is it right for man to commit sin ; and in no 
circumstances is it wrong, or unnecessary, - for him 
to do what is right. Secondly, God’s favour to the 
virtuous, and His punishment of the wicked, are not 
because He receives aught of benefit from our virtue, 
or aught of injury from our sin. His requital of us* 
is solely because of the justice of His nature. For it 
is of the essence of justice to reward the virtuous 
for their rectitude, and to inflict pain on the vicious* 
for their wickedness. If God did not do thus, He 
would not be just; and imperfection would attach to 
His superlatively excellent and perfect nature. Thirdly, 
it is not the case, that the good and bad conse- 
quences which follow virtue and vice spring spon- 
taneously from works. God has appointed those con- 
sequences. 



VIRTUE AND VICE 


199 


Such are vice and virtue, and their consequences, 
But the understanding of man, when it became 
blind to the justice, holiness, and other attributes 
of God, got confused as to virtue and vice, and took 
to inventing a variety of perverse doctrines about 
them. Such has been, not exceptionally, the history 
of the Systematists. Of the grounds of the laws of 
virtue, and vice, on which I have touched, they 
know nothing Otherwise, they would not speak of 
both virtue and vice as causes of bondage; nor 
would they pronounce, that he who wishes for 
emancipation should be alike free from the one and 
from the other. 

The reason why the Systematists hold virtue to be 
a** cause of bondage is this. Good works, they say, 
hinder the soul of emancipation : for emancipation 
consists in the souks independence of the body, mind, 
apprehension, will, etc.; but good works, in order to 
reap the fruits appertaining to them, compel the 
soul, until this end is accomplished, to wear the 
form of a God, or of a man, or such like. Moreover, 
happiness, the fruit of good works, is beneath the 
ambition of a wise man; it being implicated, in two 
ways, with misery. In the first place, it is fugacious ; 
since whatever has a beginning must have an end; 
and the fruit of virtue, like other things that have 
not always existed, must pass away. When a man 
obtains happiness, he is happy ; but, when the 
happiness oomes to a period, there supervenes misery ; 
and so happiness itself amounts to misery. In the 
second place, there is inequality in the fruit of virtue ; 
that is to say, he whose virtue is inconsiderable is 



*200 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

meagrely rewarded, while he whose virtue is more 
abundant receives a larger recompense. The former 
must repine at seeing the latter; and thus his very 
happiness makes him wretched. In this way all 
happiness whatsoever partakes of the character of 
misery; and hence, to be freed from both, and to 
become insensible, is the most transcendent aspiration 
of humanity. 

But how erroneous is all this ! God, I have 
shown, has appointed those things to be good works, 
which, in respect of the nature of man, are incumbent 
on him, and, fdr forbearing to do which, man, in 
the eye of justice, deserves punishment. Can, then; 
the fruit of those works which are incumbent on 
man, ever be evil? In your opinion, since the wish 
for the fruit of good works, happiness, misbeseems a 
man of prudence, that fruit is an evil. Again, since 
you maintain, that the true well-being of the soul 
consists in its parting with apprehension and will, 
and in becoming insensible, you ought rather to 
consider this state to be the fruit of virtue. Herein 
you have exactly inverted things. What ! has Qod 
enacted the law of virtue and vice after the mann^p 
•of a net, with no reason but to entangle souls in it, 
like so many birds, and to divert Himself withal ? 
Has He fixed at random, that some works are bad, 
and that others are good, so that souls may some- 
times be entrapped in one snare, and sometimes in 
the other? But, if God, simply because of His just 
and excellent nature, has established those works to 
be virtuous, which, in respect of the nature of the 
soul, are incumbent on it, will not He — a sea of 



VIRTUE AND VICE 


201 


mercy and goodness, and Who, as the Father of all, 
desires the welfare of all, nay, Who devises a way 
and a means for the welfare of even such as do 
what is amiss — give to such as do ®what is right, 
that which will constitute their true well-being ? 
Instead of well-being, will He, indeed, decree to such 
a soul a recompense to its harm? The fact is, how- 
ever, that the attainment of a state of insensibility 
is not true emancipation; and they who, by God’s 
mercy, arrive at true emancipation, will suffer no 
injury in their faculties, as those of apprehension 
and will. This I shall show further on. 

Again, you mistake in arguing, that the fruit of 
virtue, happiness, is perishable. I have already made 
^>ut your maxim to be utterly baseless — that all 
products must, as such, come to an end. Further, 
if perishable happiness is of the nature of misery, it 
cannot be the fruit of virtue; for, since that which 
it is obligatory on man to do is virtue, will God 
requite with misery him who does what is obligatory ? 
You think, too, that virtue is a thing which is to be 
done for , only a limited time, after which, it being 
discontinued, the reward follows. Hence your fear, 
that the reward also will, after a time, be dis- 
continued. As I have said, however, virtue is a thing 
which it is perpetually incumbent on man to do, 
whether he be in this world, or in another. As long 
as he has being, so long should he go on practising 
virtue. While he continues in virtue, its beneficent 
requital will ever remain with him ; but, when he 
f alls^ away from virtue, its reward terminates. But 
the misery which then ensues is not the consequence 



202 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


of virtue, but of vice; for even desistance from 
virtue is vice. Who, one may here ask, is equal to 
such unintermitted virtue ? Grant, that endless 
happiness is the reward of such virtue as you speak 
of: still, what shall we profit by hoping for it? It 
is true, I reply, that we men have all become so 
corrupt in our nature, that we are incapable of 
practising virtue ; and, therefore, if we hope to 
compass the loftiest aim of man on the strength of 
our virtue, we shall be benefited nothing. But God, 
in compassion for us sinners, has revealed His word, 
and has thereby marked out a way, by following 
which, all our sins will be pardoned, and that 
reward, by His mercy, will be bestowed upon us, 
which would have attached to virtue, had virtue 1 " 
been practicable to us Then will our fallen nature 
be purged and purified; the ability to practise virtue 
will be vouchsafed to us; and we shall abide near to 
God, and dwell in the realms of glory, and enjoy 
everlasting beatitude. 

The second objection which you oppose to the 
fruit of virtue is, “that it implies inequali|y ; some 
being rewarded more, and others, less : and this alsix, 
is a ground of misery. My answer is, that this 
inequality is no real ground of misery. The misery 
which proceeds from envy has its real root in man’s 
corrupt nature. Envy is a blemish in human nature. 
It is not found in a pure nature; it is found in a 
fallen nature. Of him whose nature is fallen the 
virtue is not really virtue : and, accordingly, he cannot 
obtain the fruit of virtue. How evident is it, from 
this, that the System atists were not acquainted with 



VIRTUE AND VICE 


203 


the true character of virtue and that of vice t 
Little did they know of the nature which virtue 
requires. How can he whose nature is corrupt do 
works that are right? Outwardly, he may imitate 
them ; but still he retains his corrupt nature, which 
renders genuine virtue impossible to him. Works 
only externally good are not the whole of virtue. 
That, in the sight of God, is virtue, which comes from 
a pare heart. I will exemplify what I mean. It is 
proper for a man to show friendship to a friend. 
Rut, if a simulator, merely from sense of shame, is 
outwardly courteous to his friends, but inwardly 
bears them malice, can he, in the sight of God, be a 
doer of proper works? Know, then, that they alone 
^rhose nature is pure are capable of virtue, and that 
only such as they will receive the reward of virtue. 
Others, they may see, are, for greater virtue than 
their own, rewarded more largely ; but they will 
not, on that account, feel envy. On the contrary, it 
belongs to a pure nature to take pleasure in the 
increase of the happiness of others. And thus, that 
which is a source of misery to an evil nature is, to 
a pure nature, rather a source of joy. 

From their ignorance of the tree character of 
virtue, and that of vice, the pundits err, again, 
in maintaining, that, on the acquisition of right 
apprehension, all previous sins are effaced, and that 
current works become inoperative, or, in other words, 
that nothing piacular inheres in the bad actions 
which the rightly apprehensive man is constantly 
committing. This is altogether untenable. For what 
connexion is there between the conviction, that I am 



m THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

not my body, and the effacement of sin? To sin is 
to do that which, in all circumstances and conditions, 
is improper for man; and hence, by so doing, man 
becomes, before God, guilty and deserving of punish- 
ment. Is all this set aside by my knowing that I 
am not body ? Moreover, if accumulated and current 
works are obliterated, why not fructescent works as 
well ? The issue of the whole matter is, that it is 
vain to hope for salvation on the score of knowing 
the body to be not identical with the soul; for this 
knowledge cannot avail to save a man from evil works, 
or from their penalty. 

From this it is clear, that the Hindu, in his ignor- 
ance of the nature of virtue and that of vice, sup- 
poses their laws to be baseless and fortuitous. Efe 
seems to have little notion of the moral goodness or 
badness of works, and to regard them as producing 
their effects physically, or mechanically. It plainly 
appears, from what the pundits have written on this 
subject, that, in their opinion, pretty much as food 
possesses an inherent property of appeasing hunger, 
and as poison possesses an inherent property of 
causing death, so some works have an innate virtue 
to ensure celestial happiness, while others have the 
efficacy of consigning to Hell. Whatever produces 
happiness is virtue; and whatever produces misery 
is vice. A foolish man, therefore, who desires the 
happiness of Elysium, etc., will aim to practise virtue. 
But he who, weary alike of the happiness and of the 
misery of an existence of vicissitude, gives up both, 
and yearns after emancipation, will assuredly free 
himself from such a plague. He cannot, however, 



VIKTUE AND VICE 


205 


rid himself of it readily. For, if, so long as he is in 
a state of misapprehension, in order to escape from 
the bondage of virtue, he resolves to give up good 
works, in so doing he transgresses. Hence he must 
acquire right apprehension, which is the only panacea 
against virtue. 

Similarly, with regard to vice, the pundits think, 
that, as some substances, poison, for instance, possess 
an innate virtue of injuring, which, yet, under certain 
conditions, is neutralized, so, though bad works have an 
intrinsic property of entailing evil — as the torments 
of Hell— yet, in the case of the rightly apprehensive 
man, that property is rendered inefficacious. It is his 
right knowledge which serves to counteract it. And, 
therefore, the sin of such a man does not affect him . 1 

But, more especially, the fact of the pundits’ main- 
taining, that good and bad works produce their effects, 
happiness and misery, in a physical manner, becomes 
plainly manifest from their invention of requitative 
efficacy as an objective entity. Their reason for 
believing in what they style requitative efficacy 2 is 
this. { Good works,’ they say, * are the cause of 
elysian happiness, and bad works are the cause of 
infernal dolour. And how can this be so? For, if a 

1 If the Hindus had a correct conception of the moral good- 
ness and badness of actions, ’they would not be found to 
argue, that Krishna and other members of the pantheon 
were not defiled by their deeds of wickedness, simply on the 
ground that those gods were endowed with great power, and 
were secured from the evil consequences of what they did. 
On moral grounds, the very commission of such wickedness 
Js defilement. 

2 In Sanskrit, ap&rva. 



206 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

man does a good act to-day, he does not, therefore, at 
once go to Elysium, but after the lapse of perhaps 
a long period, when he dies. How, then — a cause 
being that which immediately precedes an effect — is 
that good work the cause of his going to Elysium ? s 
Involved in this grave embarrassment, the pundits, 
with a view to liberate themselves from it, allege, 
that there is produced, in the soul, by good or by 
bad works, the quality denominated requitative effi- 
cacy ; and it is this which consigns the soul to Ely- 
sium, or to Hell It is, then, through the medium 
of requitative efficacy that good and bad works lead, 
respectively, to Elysium and to Hell. This re- 
quitative efficacy is what they mean by merit or de- 
merit. But what, I would ask, is the necessity 
of this embarrassment ? Good and bad works are not 
immediately originative of desirable and undesirable 
consequences, but mediately. And how are they so 
mediately? As I have said before, God, who is just, 
in consideration of the virtue and vice of men, him- 
self appoints corresponding reward for them. Since, 
therefore, this reward depends on the will of God, 
when it seems proper to Him, .He bestows it — at 
once, it may be, or by and by. And so there is no 
need of the invention of requitative efficacy* One 
man serves another, and is daily entitled to wages; 
and yet his master pays him at a time which he 
himself determines ; monthly, or half-yearly, or annu- 
ally. But, possibly, some one may say, 1 that, as the 
hireling, from serving his master, becomes entitled 

x Not that any pundit -would hold such language ; but a 
foreigner might, if bent on rationalizing Hinduism. 



VIRTUE AND VICE 


207 


daily to his wages, just so man, from doing good 
works, or evil, becomes an heir of Elysium, or of 
Hell; and his having such a heritage is, for him, re- 
quitative efficacy. If, I reply, the pundits had said 
only thus much, there would have been no harm. 
But they lay down requitative efficacy as being a 
real and distinct entity. Eor example, the Naiyayikas 
and the Vaiseshikas reckon it among the qualities of 
the soul — apprehension, will, happiness, misery, and 
the rest; and I affirm, that such a thing cannot be 
proved to exist. Furthermore, I would say to the 
pundits, that, if you believe in requitative efficacy as 
a distinct thing generated by good and evil works, 
you ought to believe it to be generated by service, 
4n the instance of one man who works for another; 
for the same objection presents itself in both cases 
alike. In fact you ought to believe in a similar 
efficacy in countless other instances besides that of 
service; and then, instead of twenty-four qualities, 
you would have qualities innumerable. 

The error which I have here charged on the 
pundits, though it is not perfectly manifest in the 
Naiyayika and some other Systems, is yet very clear 
in the Sankhya and Mimansa; these not believing 
in God, and yet affirming, that good and bad works, 
through requitative efficacy, lead to Elysium and to 
Hell. In their opinion, from casting an offering into 
the fire, with utterance of the formula, ‘To Indra; 
may it speed", requitative efficacy is engendered, that 
which, of its own motion, fructifies in elysian bliss 
and so forth. What need, then, of God? How 
strange is all this ! 



208 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


On the point at present in discussion, the Sankhyas 
and Mlmansakas labour under miserable misconcep- 
tion; and the rest of the System atists, also, are more 
or less in the wrong. Eor, at the beginning of this 
book, where I have spoken of the doctrines held in 
common by the Systems, it will have been seen, that, 
though the Systematists dissent among themselves 
on some few matters, yet, on almost every capital 
question they are alike as to method of considera- 
tion and as to reach and bias of intellect. They 
have all of them tenements of the same sort of 
foundation, and fabric, and model, however different 
in outer aspect. One of them may carry a certain 
error to greater extremes than the rest; but in these 
as well inheres that error, in embryo. 



CHAPTER IY 


Examination • of the Views concerning the State of 
Emancipation, professed , in common, by the 
Naiyjyikas and by the VaisesWkas. 

I have thus given an account of the Naiyayika 
and Yaiseshika theories as regards God, the soul, 
the soul’s wretchedness, the cause of that wretched- 
ness, the way of escape from it, and virtue and vice. 
The treatment of a single # topic more will bring this 
second section to an end. And that topic is, the 
miserable condition to which the Naiyiyikas and 
Vaiseshikas give the name of emancipation ; their 
views on this article growing out of their lamentable 
conceptions touching God, etc. Is to lose the facul- 
ties of apprehension, will, and all manifestations of 
sensibility, and to become like a stone, the loftiest 
aim of the soul? In what, I would ask, does this 
state differ from annihilation? In reply to two 
objections of the pundits, the one real, and the other 
presumed: that, if the fruition of happiness he 
allowed to belong to the state of emancipation, and, 
if that happiness varies in degree to different 
recipients, some among the emancipated must be 
envious of others less favoured than themselves ; 
and that, if cognition, will, and other such faculties 

14 



210 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

survive in emancipation, the emancipated might admit 
evil desires, and hence incur danger of falling into 
sin ; I maintain, that they who know not the power 
of God, and the greatness of His grace, may have 
such fears. But we, for our parts, who possess the 
true word of God, learn, from it, that such as accept 
the terms of salvation which God has offered, and 
become participators in His grace, will be translated, 
after death, to the abodes of bliss, and that God will 
so purify their nature, that they shall never more 
be affected with evil desires, envy, enmity, pride, 
and such like. To them will be given, in Heaven, 
celestial and indefectible bodies; and they will retain 
all the mental characteristics of conscious beings, 
and will be for ever blest with the beatific vision, and" 
with the highest joy, ineffable and divine, in being 
near to Him, and in paying Him adoration, and — 
their nature being made pure — with serenity of soul, 
and with peace; their happiness always increasing, 
and subject to no intermission. And tell me, pray, 
which state deserves rather to be called the highest 
aim of man ; this, or one of total unconsciousness ? 
This latter is, indeed, not the highest aim of man, 
but, contrariwise, the lowest of degradations. You 
say, that souls have existed from all duration, and 
have, in the meantime, passed through births and 
deaths unnumbered, suffering incessantly the miseries 
of an existence of vicissitude. Now and then one 
has grown wise, and has aspired to escape from 
its wretchedness, and, to this end, has practised, 
during several births, austerities, contemplation, and 
similar observances. And what reward has it received 



VIEWS CONCEENING EMANCIPATION 211 


at last, except the becoming insensible, like a stone, 
— a state equivalent to annihilation ? Of nothing, 
then, is the destiny so cruel as is that of the soul. 
So long as, dating from past eternity, it remains 
conscious, it is subject to wretchedness ; and it can 
hope for no exemption from this wretchedness, other 
than annihilation If we were atheists, not believing 
in God, and if our deliverance from misery depended 
on our own efforts, to look for emancipation such as 
yours might be fitting But, as we believe in a God, 
inscrutable in power, replete with all goodness, most 
bountiful, all-merciful, and the Giver of every felicity; 
and as we hope for emancipation at His hands; it 
seems to us reasonable to expect an emancipation 
“"better than the miserable state to which you give 
that name. Two ways of attaining the chief aim of 
the soul are found in the true word of God; by 
human actions, and by the grace of the Lord. 
According to the first, on a man’s doing that which 
it is binding on him to do, the reward of his works 
is bestowed upon him by God. A soul that should 
always thus do would be rewarded with constant 
happiness , and to enjoy such happiness is the highest 
aim of man. But, again, it is written, in the word of 
God, that it surpasses our strength to follow this 
way; for we have all become corrupt, through sin, 
and our works are unworthy of God’s acceptance, 
Our well-being is, therefore, wholly dependent upon 
the grace of God. By our works we can merit only 
Hell; but, since God is merciful, He desires to save 
us by His free grace. In order that we may secure 
this grace, He has contrived a wondrous plan, giving 



212 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

proof of His illimitable and ineffable compassion- 
ateness, and altogether in harmony with His justice 
and holiness. And, since He has opened, on our 
behalf, the treasury of His boundless mercies, will 
He make our highest happiness to consist in being 
conformed to the condition of a stone ? Endless 
happiness, whether compassed by works, or by God’s 
grace, alone deserves to receive the name of the 
highest aim of man. Why, then, will you have it to 
consist in unconsciousness? The truth is, that this 
matter cannot be understood save with the help of 
the illumination derivable from God's own word ; 
and he who rests solely on his own intelligence, in 
reasoning about it, may well end in some such 
doctrine as that of the Systematists ; namely, that* 
to be emancipated is to become unconscious. The 
speculators just mentioned proceed somewhat as 
though they thought they were to be saved by a 
scheme and by labour of their own: and whence 
can they, unfortunates, hope to obtain everlasting 
happiness? Hence it is, that, in their estimation, 
they will secure everything that is to be * secured, if 
only, bereft of all consciousness, they get quit of the 
distress which infests an existence of vicissitude. 
But know, ye Hindus, that to achieve even thus 
much is impossible for you. God made the soul 
cognitive; and who shall make it incognitive? The' 
nature with which God endowed the soul cannot be 
annulled by reflecting, that * I am not mind, I am 
not body’. Be assured that our souls will for ever 
continue conscious. Two things are, however, placed 
before us, ^between which to make our election. God, 



VIEWS CONCERNING EMANCIPATION 213 


in his word, points out the way of salvation, If we 
accept it, we shall make our consciousness the instru- 
ment of eternal joy. If, on the other hand, we reject 
it, we shall make our consciousness the instrument 
of eternal affliction and torment. As, therefore, you 
seek for well-being, accept the genuine word of 
God. 

My motive in exposing the faults of the Systems 
has not at all been, to convict their authors of 
error, for the purpose of holding them up to ridicule. 
My aim has been, to show, that whoever — whether 
they, or I, or any one else — undertakes to argue, in 
reliance on unaided reason, about divine and spiritual 
things, must constantly fall into error ; the mind 
of man being impotent to understand them rightly. 
When you are convinced, that they are correctly 
described in the Christian religion, you will know, 
that this is the true religion of God. Accordingly, it 
is my wish, that you should study the Christian 
Scriptures, and with candour. To this study, fixed 
attention, docility, and patient thought are indispen- 
sable ; for, when a man has, during a long space of 
time, entertained any particular set of opinions, he 
is slow to perceive their faults, and to recognize the 
excellence of what conflicts with them. But, if you 
conduct this investigation with humble prayer to God, 
you shall attain to a knowledge of the truth. 




SECTION III 




CHAPTER I 


Description of the Three Sorts of Existence held in 
the Vedanta : the Key to a Eight Understanding 
of that Scheme of Philosophy. 

Having briefly 6onsidered five out of the six great 
Hindu systems, I shall, in this section, examine the 
Vedanta. And to engage in such an examination in 
the present day is especially important. The Hindus, 
it is true, refer all the systems to Rishis; but, in 
our time, these systems, the Vedanta apart, have no 
followers, except perhaps here and there an individual. 
As for the Vedanta, it is held by a large majority of 
all Hindus. 

The Vedantins argue three sorts of existence; and 
one must thoroughly comprehend and ponder them, 
in order to take in the meaning of their scheme. 
These they designate as true, practical, and apparent. 1

existence is that of Brahma; practical, that of ether, etc.; 
apparent, that of nacrine silver and the like,* 



218 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


That which verily exists is called true, and its 
existence, true existence ; 1 and this existence, accord- 
ing to the Vedanta, is predicable of Brahma exclusively. 
The second species of existence has the name of 
practical. The things to which it belongs do not 
veritably exist : only the misapprehensive, or ignorant, 
mistake them for existent, and by means of them 
transact practical life ; whence the epithet. And it 
must be kept in mind, that, as the things just spoken 
of are thought to be not veritably existent, but to be 
imagined by ignorance, precisely so is it with the 
use made of them. For instance, a man in a dream 
drinks water, or mounts a horse : the water and the 
horse are visionary ; and so are the drinking and the 

1 Dr. J. R. Ballantyne takes ptiramarthika to denote ‘being, 
in its highest sense.’ — Christianity Contrasted , etc., p, 38. 

That paramdrthika, popularly, is everywhere used to signify 
* true ’, one may learn without any very laborious search. The 
adverb paramdrthatah means ‘in truth’, ‘indeed’, etc. 

The fact, that the Vedantins, in contradistinguishing practical 
and apparent existence from the first species, style them mithya, 
or false, is a further proof, that the sense here attached to 
pdramdrthika is alone correct* Though the word is technical 
with the Vedantins, they have done no violence to its ordinary 
meaning. 

Vijnana Bhikshu, on an occasion where he employs para- 
mdrthikatva — the abstract substantive of pdramarthika — in the 
sense of * unchangeableness and eternal ness clearly intimates, 
that his acceptation of the term, as a follower of the Ssnkhya, 
is different from that of the Vedantins. See the S&nhlvya-pra- 
mchana-bhS’Shya , p. 25. 

The torture to which Vijnana habitually — and especially in 
the Sankhya-sfira — subjects the whole compass of the Vedanta 
nomenclature, reminds one forcibly of the sanctimonious 
vocabulary of free-handlers and secularists among our contem- 
poraries in Christian countries.

mounting. If the use to which one puts a thing is 
veritable, the thing also must be veritable; for, to 
have veritable dealings with that which is false is 
impossible. Can a man in his waking senses bathe 
in a river that he saw m his sleep ? The things 
which, agreeably to the phraseology of the Vedantins, 
are practical, are the very things which all men, 
themselves excepted, call true: and such are Isvara, 
or the maker of the world, souls, and all the world 
besides . 1 Their existence these philosophers hold 
to be the result of ignorance ; and such existence is 
termed, by them, practical. The third species of 
existence, denominated apparent, resembles the practi- 
cal, in that it is false, but, by mistake, seems to be

Vedanta, how is it, that there are souls, subject to three con- 
ditions, those of waking , dreaming , and insensible sleep, and 
employers of objects ; and how is it , that an Isvara, effecting 
the experience of souls , is revealed by scripture ; and how is it, 
the aggregate of objects subserving experience is found as a 
thing apart from these ? If monism were true, all these would 
present themselves as incompatible. With reference to such an 
objection, it is set forth as follows, with intent to declare,

veritable. It differs, however, from the practical in 
three respects. First, the ignorant, that is to say, 

that souls, the woild, and Isvara can all reasonably be admitted 
as things of imagination surmised m Brahma. 

A little further on, Ananda Giri says : 3Tcft

"O 

mfeTTf j * Therefore it is enunciated, that the three con- 
ditions, and the souls subject thereto, and the Illusive Brahma, 
i.e Isvara , are all imagined in the pure Brahma.’ 

The reason why the Vedantms use such an expression as 
‘ silver imagined m nacre is, of course, that the nacre is the 
substrate of the imaginary silver. Strictly analogous, in their 
view, to the nacre and silver of this illustration are Brahma 
and the world, etc., where they speak of the world, souls, an#* 
Isvara, as imagined by the ignorant, m Brahma. It is to be 
understood, that Brahma is not the subject of the imagination, 
but its object. 

A most eminent authority in Vedanta matters, Sarvajnatma 
Muni, thus instructs the learner:

world, of Ida, and of souls, by the ignorance forcibly possessing 
thee, appears— albeit unsubstantial, viz., barren of true exist - 
^ence— substantial, until the sun of right apprehension rises.’ 

This couplet has been interpreted in accordance with the 
gloss of Ma&husfldana Sarasavati, who takes gddham as an 
adverb. 

Isa, or Isvara— the maker of the world — and souls, since 
*the Vedantins consider them as, no less than the world 
itself, ignorance-imagined and false, come under the category 
i of things practical.

ordinary men, do not constantly, but only now and 
then, mistake for veritable the apparent objects to 
which it appertains ; as naerine silver, and the matters 
of a dream. Nor, secondly, is there any practical 
dealing with these things. Let a man who mistakes 
nacre for silver offer it for sale : he will not get for 
it the price of silver ; for it will be recognized, by others, 
as another substance. Thirdly, it is because of igno- 
rance, that the practical seems to be veritable; but 
it is by reason, additionally to ignorance of distance 
and other causes, called defects, enumerated by the 
Naiyayikas, etc., that the apparent seems veritable . 1 
Such are the Vedantins three sorts of existence, the 
true, the practical, and the apparent. 

To obtain a ]ust view of the Vedanta doctrine, or 
even to appreciate its fallacy, it is all-important to

master its theory of three existences. It must be 
understood, that it is not because existent things 
are — in any way to us intelligible — of various kinds, 
that the Vedantins contend for a difference in their 
existence. In other words, they do not predicate a 
difference between the existences of things, because 
one is eternal and another is uneternal, or because 
one is self-existent and another exists dependency . 1 
It is a difference m the very nature of existing, not 
in its mode, that they insist upon. Their view on 
"this subject will now be exhibited. 

To the Vedantins the establishment of monism, or 
non-duality, is most essential. They wish to make 
out the soul to be Brahma, and the world to be false ; 

‘ A defect is a cause of wrong notion ; a virtue, of right 
notion. Defects are pronounced to be multifarious, as bile, 
giving rise to jaundice , distance, etc.’ 

1 According to the Vedanta, souls, as souls, and also igno- 
rance and Isvara, are beginningless and self-existent. Still, 
we find ascribed to them a different existence from that of 
Brahma. It is called false. 

For the unorigmatedness of souls, etc , see the last quotation 
in p. 49. The source of the couplet there given has not been 
ascertained. Its statements are, however, called in question 
by no Vedantm. Among the various treatises which cite it 
is, besides the Siddhdntu-ratnamdld , the Knshndlankdra of 
Achyutakrishna Ananda Tirtha ; a commentary on Appayya 
Dikshita’s Siddhdnta-le&a. Moreover, it is at the tongue’s 
end of almost every student of the Vedanta. 

Achyutakrishpa reads, as the second quarter of the distich 

twr* ♦likewise the distinction, 'between the 

soul and Isa.’ This lection is by much to be preferred.

whence it would follow, that Brahma solely is true, 
and that nought but him exists, or ever existed, or 
at any time will exist From the couplet of the 

Siva-glttt, which I shall quote in the sixth chapter, 
and from numberless other passages of Vedanta works, 
it is manifest, that, in their view, the world is 
false, and imagined by ignorance. Not that they 
only figuratively call it false — as we sometimes 
call things of an evanescent and perishable charac- 
ter ; but they mean, that it is indeed so, like naerine 
silver . 1 As such silver is nothing, and wholly from 

and ignorance, when leferred to souls m several, are only 
fractional portions of illusion. See the Vedmta-saia, pp. etc.

ignorance seems to be something, just so, they say, is 
the world nothing, it being imagined by ignorance, 
that is, it seeming, simply by reason of ignorance, to 
exist. To maintain otherwise would be to surrender 
non-duality. 

Further, it is surprising to find, that the ignorance 
which imagines the world is laid down as being itself 
ignorance-imagined, and hence false. 1 They refuse to 
grant that even this is true; and consistently, else 
non-duality would be impeached by the presentation 
of another entity than Brahma — ignorance. Thus it 
is, that they would establish Brahma alone to be true, 
and all besides to be illusory. When, therefore, they 
give the epithet of true to the existence of Brahma, 
and that of practical to the existence of the world, we" 
are to understand, that, in their system, that existence 

argument are the monists to he shunned, but, further, because 
there is no proof to establish the untrueness of the world. 
To this effect it is set forth, m the aphorism : * The world is 
true, since its origination is from a cause that has no defect, 
and since there is nothing to make out the world to be false.* 
The objects of a dream, the imagined yellowness of a white 
conch-shell, etc., are found, among men, to be untrue, by 
reason that they owe their origin to the internal organ, etc., 
infected by the defects of sleep, etc. This untrueness does not 
belong to the universe made up of the great principle and the 
rest ; for the causes of that universe , nature and the intellect 
of Hiranyagarbha, the Creator , are free from all defect.* 

The aphorism cited in this extract is vi, 52. 

Yijnana, in continuation, will have it, that the Vedantins 
wrest from their legitimate drift the passages of the Yeda 
which they adduce to establish, that the world is false. For, 
he says, if those passages mean as is pretended, the result is 
suicidal; the Veda being itself of the world, 

1 See the eighth chapter of this section. 



THREE SORTS? OE EXISTENCE 225 

which is indeed real is called true, and the epithet 
of practical is given to false existence, or existence 
which in fact is not, but, owing to mistake, seems to 
have place. 

In only applying names to real things, and to un- 
real, there is no fault. The extraordinary error of the 
Yedantins is of quite another character. I have al- 
ready said, that they would prove both the world 
and ignorance to be ignorance-imagined and altogether 
false. But, earnestly as they desire to have them so, 
their inner consciousness refuses to rate them, as alto- 
gether nothing; for the mind of man will not give 
willing entrance to an absurdity. The world, the 
Yedantins allege, is veritably nothing, but, because of 
ignorance, appears to exist ; after the manner of nacrine 
silver. Now, can the mind assent to the notion, that 
even that ignorance is nothing whatever? Never; and 
he who tries to reconcile with it his own views generally, 
and the common experience of mankind, will encounter 
obstacles at every step. Moreover, to call such ignor- 
ance nothing, is, evidently, most venturesome. Nor do 
the Yedantins feel, that the world is nought. Let it 
be believed, that, when they ‘denominate ignorance 
and the world false, they cannot help feeling, that they 
are not so far false as to be nothing at all; they must 
possess some sort or other of existence. 

On gathering, from this, that the Yedantins allow 
to the world a certain sort of existence, one might 
suppose, that they must give up non-duality; for, 
however, they may designate the world’s existence, 
if they concede, that the world really exists, their 
Brahma does not remain without a second; and the 
15 



m THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


consequence is duality. This brings us to the knot 
of their error. They argue, as was said before, for 
distinct kinds of existence— not various modes of 
existence. The world, according to them, really exists ; 
but its existence differs from that of Brahma. They 
call this existence a false existence , and their so call- 
ing it brings them into error; and this error blinds 
them to their inconsistency. The world’s existence 
is, they allege, false existence; if true, of course the 
issue would be duality. Analogously, though a mad- 
man, alone in a room, thinks himself one of a crowd, 
his so fancying does not invalidate his being there 
by himself. Mark, how the Vedantins herein err. 
Their assertion, that the untrue existence of the 
world is of no prejudice to monism, would be correct, 
if they understood such existence to be non-existence; 
as is the existence of the aforesaid madman’s crowd. 
Since that existence is allowed, by them, to be in 
fact, they do not mend the matter by calling it untrue. 
As for themselves, they think otherwise. They urge, 
that we have two 1 kinds of * existence, the true and 
the untrue. As that thing which possesses the former 
kind exists, so does that which possesses the latter; 
for it has existence: but the thing is untrue, because 
its existence is of that stamp. And so the doctrine 
of non-duality is saved uninjured. Observe, that the 
Vedantins believe in two classes of objects, true and 
untrue, and both of them really existent; only an 

i For convenience, the third kind of existence is here kept 
out of sight. 



THREE SORTS OE EXISTENCE 227 

object of the first class is really real , 1 and an object 
of the second class is unreally real . 2 

1 It is not claimed, that the expression ‘ really real and 
especially that of ‘unreally real’, does not savour strongly of 
the absurd. But it is things altogether absurd that aie here 
taken account of. 

Among unreally real things are included, with the piactical, 
things apparent, soon to be spoken of Added to these, and the 
‘ true, there is a fourth class, to comprehend positive unrealities. 
Examples of objects of this class are, the son of a barren woman, 
a hare’s horn, sky-blossoms, etc. Their technical epithet is 
tuchchha . 

2 The notion of practical existence, entertained by the Vedan- 
tms, is, summarily, a combination of two contradictory ideas, 
that of existence and that of non-existence. This assertion 
may be made good simply by showing, that, while the endeavour 
to prove the world, and all other practical things, no less than 
all that are apparent, to be nothing whatever, they believe, 
that the same things are something. The first of these antagonis- 
tic positions has been illustrated, and will be illustrated further ; 
and, as for the second, it is evident, on inspecting the books of 
the Vedantins, that they receive as realities the world and 
whatever else they call practical. Moreover, as has been seen, 
they comprehend their Isvara, maker of the world, among 
practical and false objects, and yet believe, that he really exists. 
On perusing the eighth chapter, the reader will, further, be 
satisfied, that, though they would prove the ignorance which 
imagines the world to be nothing at all, yet they cannot hut 
allow, that it has a certain real existence. 

That the view here taken is correct, confirmation is furnished 
by the words of two very celebrated Hindu philosophers, 
Parthasarathi Misra and Vijnana Bhikshu, writers on the 
Mlmansd and on the Sankhya, respectively. 

BarthasSrathi, refuting the Vedanta, urges, that, inasmuch 
as the universe is certified, by perception, to be true, it can- 
not be made out false. If, he says, it is held, on the word 
of the Veda, to be false, the Veda itself, as being included 
in the universe, must be false; and, consequently its proof 
is invalid. 



m THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


Furthermore, the aspect of these classes of objects 
varies according to the point of view from which they 
are beheld — conceive true existence and practical 
existence as two stations, with a station intermediate.

MS fol. 57, verso * “ We do not say, that the universe is 
unreal ; since it is established, by perception and other proofs, 
to exist. Nor do we say> that it has true existence ; it being 
falsified by right apprehension of spirit. The universe cannot, 
therefore, be described either as true, or as unreal.” All this 
is hollow. To be other than true is to be unreal. If, then, 
the universe be not true, manifestly it is nothing but unreal. 



THREE SORTS OE EXISTENCE 229 

A person located at practical existence does not style 
its objects unreally real : for, to his eyes, there is only 
•one sort of existence ; and all that presents itself to 
him he must deem simply real. In circumstances 
similar to his are, according to the Vedanta, all who 

On the other hand, if not unreal, it follows, that it is true. 
For the denial of either of these, trueness and unreality, 
implies the affirmation of the other : and no alternative 
besides these is possible. “ That which never presents itself — 
as the horn of a hare — is held for unreal ; and that which 
presents itself, and is never falsified — as the true nature of 
spirit— is held for true; and, as for the universe, since it 
presents itself, and yet is falsified by right apprehension, it is 
not to be described as true, or, yet, as unreal.*' The view thus 
propounded , as being at war with ordinary consciousness, is 
impossible of establishment. For that which presents itself, 
and is falsified— as the mirage, or a snake surmised in 
a rope— is positively unreal; as, to be sure, all the world 
is persuaded ; there being no difference, in the estimation of 
mankind generally, between such a thing as the horn of a 
Tiare and such a thing as the mirage. Hence, if the uni- 
verse be falsified by right apprehension , it is simply unreal, 
and so is not incapable of being described as true or as unreaV 

Observe whence this argument sets out. Parthasarathi begins 
by arguing, that the Vedantins cannot uphold the falseness of 
-the universe on the faith of the Veda ; for that the Veda is 
part and parcel of their false universe. Now, since the Vedan- 
tins fall back on the Veda as the foundation of their belief, it 
cannot be supposed, that they look upon it as altogether 
nothing. The end of the argument adduced above, by the 
Vedantin, is to reconcile these two positions : that the universe, 
•the Veda inclusive, is indeed false and that, nevertheless it is 
■existent. Herein we have the combination of two irreconcilable 
ideas, spoken of at the beginning of this note. So understands 
Parthasarathi ; and he proceeds, to deal with the ictaa on the 
basis of common sense. 

The subjoined words of the same writer, which follow shortly 
alter the passage just extracted, support what is asserted in

are known as misapprehensive, or ignorant. Again, a 
person located at true existence would not designate 
its one object, Brahma, as really real : for, with him 
likewise, only one sort of existence would offer itself 
for inspection; and that, as above, as simply real. 
Such would be the standing point of the Yedantins’ 
Brahma, except for his lacking the faculty of cogni- 
tion — as will be seen by and by. A person located 
at the intermediate station, just now mentioned, is 
enabled to pass in review the objects of both the 

the text. The Vedantin is asked, whether he takes nescience 
to import misapprehension, or something else, causative 
thereof. In neither case can it appertain to Brahma ;

‘In respect of those who accept erroneous apprehension, or a

It will be made plain, in the eighth chapter, that the 
Vedantms cannot repute their ignorance to be quite a non- 
entity , and yet, to save the dogma of monism, and other 
doctrines, they essay to prove, at the same time, that ignorance 
is false, or a non-entity. If, m assigning to ignorance false 
existence, an existence other than that of Brahma, they meant 
only, that it is subjective, transitory, or the like, and, on that 
aecount, different in kind from their eternal Brahma;’ and if 
they meant, by the tenet of non-duality nothing more than 
this, that, Brahma apart, there is nought of an ever-enduring 
character ; ’ there would be no want of reasonableness m the 
conception. This style of non-duality would take no harm 
from ignorance ; and there would have been no opening for the 
polemics of Parthasarathi. The truth is, that they do not 
understand the falseness of ignorance, and that of the world, in 
this way; but, to preserve monism, they would make out both 
ignorance and the world to be positive non-entities. This, 
their aim, to establish ignorance as a non-entity, is ignored, by 
ParthasSrathi, as an absurdity beneath his notice.

other stations ; and he alone can speak of those objects 
as they veritably are. By him they all alike are seen 
to be real; the true object, as really real, and practi- 
cal objects, as unreally real. This person is the 
Vedantin. 

To their third kind of existence she Vedantins give 
the appellation of apparent. A perusal of what is 
now to be said of it will elucidate the statements 
just put forth, and will serve to induce confidence in 
them. It is objects of error, such as nacrine silver,, 
and a snake imagined in a rope, that are meant by

This passage takes in the twenty-third and twenty-fourth 
aphorisms of the SdnJchya-pravachana , Book I. The first is 
put into the mouth of a Vedantin; and the second curtly 
replies to it. 

Vijnana Bhikshu asserts, that the portion of the S&nkhya - 
pravachana here quoted from is directed, primarily, against the 
Bauddhas, but that it tells with equal relevancy, in confutation 
of the illusionists (mdydvddin) and crypto-Bauddhas (pro- 
chhanna-bauddha ), The Vedantins are denoted by both these 
titles. The latter is applied to them* dyslogistieally ; and the 
application is far from infrequent. 



232 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

apparent objects. As was before remarked, it is not 
because of any rationally assignable difference in the 
nature of things, but because of a belief in difference 
as to their very existence, that the Vedantins ascribe 
to them different sorts of existence. By what I am 
about to show, this assertion will be evinced as true. 
No one can suspect, as regards what is styled 
apparent existence, that it is so styled on account of 
any rationally assignable difference, in the nature of 
the things of which it is affirmed, from that of things 
true and practical; those things that are called appar- 
ent being, we are all aware, nothing. If it be said, 
that, for this very reason, apparent things may be 
held to differ in nature from other things, and that, 
therefore, for convenience, the Vedantins give a name 
to the false existence of apparent things, I reply, that 
I do not accuse them on this ground, but on the 
ground, that they reckon such existence, and the 
things to which it is ascribed, as possessing a species 
of reality. Bespecting apparent things the partisans 
of the Vedanta hold this language ; 1 that, when a man,

on seeing nacre, takes it for silver, apparent silver 

which is extant elsewhere may be taken as its object. If 
this be said, I demur ; since that silver elsewhere , not being 
m contact with an organ of sense , cannot be an object of per- 
ception.’ 

There is room to suspect, that the word fgRq in the 

first line of this extract, is an interpolation 

The objector here rebutted is a Kaiyayika, vbo, as such, 
holds misapprehension to be wbat is technically called anyathd - 
khyati. By this is meant, the apprehension of an object other- 
wise than as it is. Agreeably to the Naiyayikas, when, for 
instance, a man mistakes nacre for silver, the object of his 
mistake must be confessed to exist, but elsewhere than in 
■the place to which he erroneously refers it. That is to say, 
the very silver which he has seen in some other place is 
* supposed, by him, to he then present before him. To copy 
the Naiyayika expression, instead of perceiving nacres ess, he 
transfers the silverness, which he has seen on some other 
occasion, to the nacre lying in his sight. This view the 
Vedantm rejects, on the following giound, implied in his 
answer. The misapprehension in question is, in the view 
of the pundits, one of perception ; and, in all perception, 
the contact is essential of an organ of sense with the 
•object perceived. Absent silver cannot, therefore, account 
for the mistake committed. 

Misapprehension is by others, explained under the designation 
of asatkhyati, ‘ the apprehension of what is not’. This 
notion, on the ground of their argument given above, is also 
-disallowed by the Vedantins. 

An objection respecting things seen in dreams is thus 
-adduced and answered: PR

in the case of dreams, what there goes on may he accounted 
for by simple remembrance of a chariot, or the like, previously 
cognized, to imagine the production of those objects is not 
admissible , because cumbrous. Should this be urged, I except ; 
for, to allow mere remembrance of a chariot, or the like, to 
be here a sufficient cause is contravened by the consciousness 
of a man, m a dream, that he secs a chariot, and his con- 
sciousness, ivhen afterwards aioake, that he saw a chariot 
in a dream.’

produced, how is there proved to be a misconception ? 

for instance, the eye, labouring under the defect of bilious 
humour, or the like, and a present object, there arises an 
affection of the internal organ, m the form of that object 
and likewise m the form of its glitter. In that affection 
intelligence, that is, Bmhma, appropriated to that object , is 
reflected. At that spot, namely, wheie the object is located , in 
the manner aforesaid, by reason of the egress and advent 
there of the affection, intelligence appropriated to that object, 
intelligence appropriated to that affection, and intelligence 
the subject of right notion, these thiee, become identical. 
Afterwards, nescience — residing in the object-appropriated intel- 
ligence, one with intelligence the subject of right notion; 
cognizing nacreness as the abstract nature of the thing beheld ; 
aided by the impression of silver before seen , 'an wipession 
resuscitated by the perception of similarity in the glitter, etc., 
O/ the object present to that of silver previously seen , associated 
with the forementioned defects, bile, etc., is evolved, in the 
form of the object, the apparent silver, and also in the form 
of a semblance of a cognition of that silver.’ 

Just as, with the Sankhyas, the whole world is evolved from 
nature, with the Vedantms, all practical things aie evolutions 
from nescience, or ignorance ; and equally so are all apparent 
things, and the apprehension of them, styled, above, * the sem- 
blance of a cognition’. In the evolution of apparent things 
there is, however, the association of defects, which have no 
place in the evolutions of things practical; as was mentioned 
in the text, at p. 218, and the related note. The statement 
which we have seen about the identification of three sorts of 
Intelligence is designed to show, that the misapprehension of 
nacre for silver is an error of perception. This question is one 
of great difficulty ; but some light will he thrown upon it in 
the fifth chapter. The idea of identification of three sorts of 
intelligence may be thus explicated. Intelligence, or Brahma, 
is, like ether, universally diffused ; and, being so diffused it is 
said to be appropriated to everything which it contains. Ether 
is laid down as being, in reality, one. Still, though the ether 
in a jar outside a house is said to be distinct from the ether 
withm the house, yet, when the jar is brought into the house, 



236 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

In reply, I am told, that, if the silver were true, 

identity is realized of the ether of the jar with that of the 
house. Similarly, when an affection of the internal organ and 
the object of that affection become collocal, the Brahma of the 
affection and that of the object coalesce into one. The doctrine 
of the impenetrability of matter is unknown to the pundits. 
In their view, the internal organ and its evolutions are strictly 
material , and yet an affection of that organ and a material 
object can take up the same space.

it be admitted, that apparent silver exists, at the time of its 
appearance, m the nacre, the cognition, to one not misappre - 
hensive , m the form of “ This is not silver,” of the non-existence, 
through tripartite time, of silver , would not have place ; but 
the cognition would be in the form of “ This thing is not now, 
silver.” * * * If this be affirmed, it is contested : for the object 
here, of the cognition “ It is not silver is not the non-existence 
of silver as silver, but the non-existence of apparent silver, as 
true and practical.’ 

Such is the sense of the Sanskrit. Some of its expressions, 
in a literal reproduction, would only perplex the reader, and 
entail a long comment. 

It comes out from this, that, in the apprehension of the 
VedSntins, a thing may, contemporaneously, he both really 
-existent and really non-existent. When, from misapprehension, 
a man takes nacre to be silver, apparent silver, it is thought, 
is really produced, and exists for him. Another looker on, not 
-under such a misapprehension, thinks, that there is no silver 
where the other fancies he sees it. His idea, it is asserted, is 
.authentic ; the non-existence of silver, apprehended by him 



THEEE SOETS OF EXISTENCE 237 

or practical, there would be no room to speak of 

being supposed to have reference to apparent silver as true and 
practical. 

Language similar to that about apparent objects, in the last' 
extract, is found concerning practical objects also. 

The falseness of these objects is defined as follows ; 

=3 i ma., 

p. 18. ‘By a false thing is meant that whose absolute non- 
existence resides m the entirety of what is erroneously taken 
for its substrate.’ 

This definition is thus applied to things practical. Take 
a jar, for instance. Its parts are deemed, by the Naiyayikas 
and others, to be its mateiial cause and substrate. See pages 
128 and 129. But those parts are erroneously so taken, assert 
jthe Vedantins, by all but themselves ; since a jar, a practical 
object, being false, has no substiate. In the parts of the jar, 
wrongly supposed to be its substrate, resides the absolute non- 
existence of the jar itself ; and, therefore, the jar is false. 

The same definition is applied to the jar’s parts, the absolute 
non-existence of which resides in their own parts, the mateiial 
cause and the substrate of the primary parts Intermediate 
effects and causes being traversed, ignorance, fche material cause 
and substrate of everything save Brahma, is at length reached ; 
all the effects on the way having been proved false, since the 
non-existence of each resides in its material cause. Ignorance 
then comes to be dealt with. Its non-existence resides in Brahma, 
the imagined substrate, or, as it is also termed, illusory-material 
cause, of ignorance, as of all else than Brahma. Everything, 
Brahma excepted, is, thus, concluded to be false. 

To this conclusion an exception is suggested and replied to ;

* Let it not be thought, that the notion of the falseness of a

misconception; but, since it is neither, but apparent, 

existence of Brahma, the substrate of the jar, not the existence 
of the jar , the verity of the jar, etc., is not established.’

that the jar exists, can be made out to be correct, inasmuch as 
it has practical existence for its obj'ect. Conformably to this 
position, the existence, m Brahma, of a jar as true is denied, 
not that of jar as a jar. Thus there is no incongruity. According 
to this opinion, namely, that m the perception of a jar as existent , 
practical existence is apprehended, the qualification “ relative to 
a thing considered as true ” is to be added to “ absolute non- 
existence,” in the definition of falseness, lately given. 5 

By the definition of falseness, practical things have no exist- 
ence, and yet these words assign to them a sort of existence. 
On referring for comparison, to the passage from the fourteenth 
page of the Vedmta-paribMsM , at pp. 160-70, the reader will 
perceive, that practical and apparent things differ in no respect, 
among themselves, in being both true and false. 

To return to things apparent, the Vedantins do not, m all 

cases of misapprehension, contend for their production. SJ^FSS— 

iftwfsris #r i ma., 

p 14. ‘Only when a false thing imagined in one veritable is 
not m contact with an organ of sense , is an apparent thing 
acknowledged to be produced.’ 

Where, however, the object is near, the Vedantins concur 
with the Naiyayikas in admitting anyathd-khyati ; for, since the 
object is brought into contact with an organ of sense, the fact, 
that the misapprehension, is perceptional, is accounted for. To 



THBEE SOETS OF EXISTENCE

misconception has place . 1 Prom this it is clear, that, 
when the Vedantins call the existence of an apparent 
thing — a thing, they say, really produced — apparent, 
it is not because the thing differs by nature from other 
things, but because its existence differs from the exist- 
ence of other things. If the thing were different 
simply by nature, and not in respect of existence, how 
could the apprehension oi it be reputed a misconcep- 
tion? The same reasoning will apply to practical 
things, no less than to apparent: for, as the apprehen- 
sion, by one labouring under mistake, of nacrine silver, 
is considered, from the standing point of practical 
existence, to be misconception; m like manner, the 
apprehension of the world, and of the things therein, 
by those whom the Yedantms call ignorant, or even 
by the wise while detained in the body, from the 
standing point of true existence, is considered to be 
misconception . 2 

argue the production of an apparent object may, therefore, here 
be dispensed with. 

| Vedanta-pariblidslia , p. 10. * Because mis- 
apprehension about nacrine silver and the like has, for its 
object, apparent silver, etc., which are proved, by correct per- 
ception in the state of practical existence, to be false.’ 

» Since, according to a tenet of the Vedanta, all things hut 
Brahma are false, how can the cognition of them be regarded 
as right notion ? In reply to this interrogatory, it is said : —

240 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

Finally, it should be understood, that, in fact, the 
aim of the Vedantins is, to make out the world, etc., 
to be veritable non-entities ; for, this unestablished, 
even so is monism. It is the stubborn and irre- 
fragable actuality of external things that compels 
them, as it were m their own despite, to enunciate- 
a second kind of existence, one applicable to such 
things; and the character which they give to that 
existence compels them to add a third. Their inward 
impressions, however, touching their views, vary with 
varying occasions. Thus, when they turn their con- 
templation towards the world, it presents itself to- 
them as having really an existence. Then, that no 
harm may come to their notion of monism, they 
apply to that existence the epithet of false, and so 
relieve their discomfort. Yet, when they pass to 
reflect on their secondless Brahma, and in order to 
prove his secondlessness, and the world’s falsity, 
assert, that the world is ignorance-imagined, it 
appears to their minds as if the world were really 
nothing whatsoever. 

Their chief aim being as aforesaid, it must, conse- 
quently, be borne in mind — and, throughout this work, 

^frT I Cited in the Vedtinta-paribh&shd , p. 2. * As the notion, 

that the "body is one’s self, is imagined, by the ignorant , to be 
correct; even so the practical apprehension of worldly things 
is esteemed to he correct, till one attains to right apprehension 
of soul.’ 

The author of the 7 eddnta-paribhdshd expressly states, that, 
in the fourth quarter of this couplet, there is a contraction of 
d-atma-nischaydt . No one need doubt, that he is in the right. 
LauJcikam> he likewise observes, points to practical apprehen- 
sion of things of the world. 



THREE SORTS OF EXISTENCE 


241 


it is 'taken as a postulate — that, with the Vedantins, 
Brahma excepted, all is nihility. In a way, indeed, 
a real existence is allowed to what is other than 
Brahma: but, inasmuch as all this has no more 
substantiality than nacrine silver, however the Vedan- 
tins speak of it, how can we account it as, in any 
wise, existence ? And, further, it has been made 
patent, that, according to the Vedantins themselves, 
only from the standing point of practical existence 
is reality ascribable to the world; which, from the 
standing point of true existence, is devoid of reality 
of every kind and degree. 

The Vedanta recognizes, as existent, an Is vara, 
maker of the world, all-wise, and all-powerful ; and 
souls, also, and their ignorance, their doing good and 
evil, their requital in Elysium and in Hell, and their 
transmigration. And, again, all these are regarded as 
non-existent, and as absolutely so. Neither are they, 
nor have they been, nor are they to be. Brahma 
alone exists — without qualities, and eternal. All be- 
sidfs — Is vara, the world, and everything else — has but 
a false existence, and owes its being to imagination 
by ignorance. In very truth, it is nothing. Such, 
in a few words, is the creed of the Vedantins.

CHAPTER II 


Summary of the Vedanta System 

Though the Vedantins allege, that, from the stand- 
ing point of the true state of existence, Brahma alone 
is real, and all else is unreal, still, from the standing 
point of the practical state of existence, Isvara, souls, 
and the whole world, are real, that is to say, practi- 
cally real, and distinct one from another . 1 Their 
system, therefore, branches into two divisions; one 
of which has to do with the practical state of exist- 
ence, and the other, with the true state of existence. 
Great part of the first is seen in one or other o! all 
the remaining Systems. Here, as in the Nyaya and 
in the Yoga, we find an omniscient and omnipotent 
Isvara, framer and ruler of the external world.* 

i And they have been distinct from all eternity. See the 
Sanskrit extract in p. 91.

SUMMARY OF THE VEDANTA 


243 


Pretty much as in the Sankhya, and in the Yoga, 
we also here find statements of the order in which 
the world was developed. That which the Sankhyas 
call nature, the Vedantins call illusion, or ignorance. 
As for the internal organ, its affections, and many 
other articles, the Sankhya and the Vedanta coincide 
to a large extent. In several particulars, however, 
they join issue. He that would acquaint himself 
fully with those particulars must have recourse to 
special treatises on the Vedanta. It is neither my 
desire, nor is it my intention, to treat the subject 
exhaustively; an examination of its essential features 
being sufficient for my present purpose. Again, like 
'the rest of the Systematists, the Vedantins receive 
the Veda, the Puranas, etc., as authoritative. They 
believe, likewise, in good and bad works, and that, 
to receive the favourable and unfavourable requital to 
which these give rise, souls must pass to Elysium 


Sankara-Acliarya ’ s 

Brahma-sUtra-bhashya , i. 2, MS : 1 And thus the absence, from 
the standing point of true existence, of a Ruler and ruled is 
likewise shown m the Isvara-gitti. . . . But from the standing 
point of practical existence, the Veda itself supports the notion 
of an Isvara, etc., by ike words “ This is the lord of all ; this, 
the sovereign of all beings , this, the protector of creatures ; 
this, the preserving bridge against the disruption of the 
worlds. 

By the livara-gitd the Bhagavad-gUa is here meant ; the 
passage omitted— two couplets, v. 14-15 — being found there. 
In Sankara’s days the book now current under the title of 
Jsvara-gttd could not have existed. Its minute development 
of the Vedanta marks it, undeniably, as a recent composition.

and to Hell, and again and again take birth, so and 
forth To animadvert on the errors of the Vedanta 
doctrines as confined to the practical state of existence 
there is no need ; as I have refuted them, by inclusion, 
in what I have written touching the Sankhya and the 
Nyaya. 

But entirely different from anything as yet encoun- 
tered is the doctrine of the Vedantins touching the 
true state of existence, as they phrase it. And 
this doctrine is summarized in this half couplet: 

< Brahma is true ; the world is false ; the soul is

apprehended of any ; 1 who is neither parviscient nor 

when the objects of apprehension — the three worlds, thou, and 
I —all vanish into nothingness.’ 

By { beholder ’ is meant knower, or apprehender. We have 
seen how the Sankhyas attempt to justify their application 
of this term, to their puntsha, and we shall soon see how 
the Vedantms endeavour to make good its applicability to 
Brahma. Both the pmusha and Brahma are, really, un- 
intelligent. 

Yrjnana Bhikshu, m citing this passage in the S&nkhya- 
pi avachana-bhashyd, p. 97, draws on a production notoriously 
ultra-monistic , but he has there to do with a point on 
which the Sankhya and the Vedanta are quite agreed. On 
that occasion there was no room for misconstruction at his 
hands. 

The Yoga-vcisishiha , though considered as the work of 
Valmlki, and as a supplement to his Rdmayana , was doubtless 
composed subsequently to the full development of the system 
of Sankara Acharya. 

i That Brahma apprehends no one and nought, will be 
proved in the fifth chapter. That he is apprehended by no 
one follows from the position, that all apprehension is an 
affection of the internal organ ; and Brahma, it is asserted, 
never comes within the cognizance of such affection. Even 
the affection in the form of ‘ I am Brahma, essentially existent, 
intelligence, and joy, 5 which immediately precedes emancipation, 
does not cognize Brahma, but only removes the ignorance 
that hides him. See the Yedmta-s&ra, pp 21-23. Indeed, 
that which is then cognized is not the true Brahma, hut 
only his shadow, the nearest approximation to him that is> 
apprehensible, on any terms, or at any time, by one destined 
to be liberated, or actually liberated. Hence, when the 
Vedantins affirm, that Brahma is inapprehensible and ineffable, 
their meaning is not like our own, when we use such lan- 
guage regarding God. We mean, that God cannot wholly, and 
they mean that Brahma cannot at all, be known or described. 
Nothing, it is said, that comes, or that can come, within* 
the scope of apprehension, is in any wise Brahma.

omniscient ; neither parvipotent nor omnipotent ; 1 
who has neither beginning nor end ; immutable and 
indefectible — is the t true entity. All besides himself, 
the entire universe, is false, that is to say, is nothing 

1 Both Idvara and the soul are held to be ignorance-imagined 
and false. See the note at pp. 218-19. Of the same character 
are all their attributes; the omniscience, omnipotence, etc., of 
the former, and the parviscience, parvipotence, etc , of the 
latter. These attributes cannot, therefore, appertain to Brahma. 

‘ Parviseient 5 and ‘ parvipotent ’ literally translate the 
technical expressions, alpajna and alpasaktimat. 

SO so 

* ^fcT I Prom the ScmJcshepa-SMimka , MS ‘He is the all- 
knowing lord; I am a pitiful creature ; this is the world, 
wonderful in expansion. That such conceptions should arise in 
the mind of one whose inner eye is blinded by darkness, is no 
matter of amazement.’ 

That Brahma does not possess omniscience, omnipotence, etc., 
will, further, be plain to any one who will read, in almost 
any body of Vedanta doctrine, the elucidation of the utterance 
‘ That art thou tat twam asi, one of the twelve ‘ great 
sentences ’. 

The preceptor of the Vedanta, intending to instruct his 
pupil, that he is one with Brahma, is obliged, by reason that 
Brahma is inexpressible by language, to teach him, that he 
is one with l&vara, an object apprehensible, and tbe entity 
that is nearest to Brahma the inapprehensible; and a being 
lifted far above humanity, as not being liable to misapprehend. 
The pupil is to think of Dvara as shown of all attributes, 
and of himself as wanting all his own. The residual part of 
Isvara, and that of himself— Brahma in both cases— he is to 
consider as unified. This also evinces, that the characteristics 
which severally contradistinguish Isvara and soul do not belong 
to the essence of Brahma. 



248 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

whatsoever. Neither has it ever existed, nor does 
it now exist, nor will it exist at any time future. 
And the soul is one with Brahma, Such is the 
doctrine of the Vedanta regarding the true state of 
existence ; and it is denominated non-dualistic, as 
rejecting the notion of any second true entity. 

And here some one may ask, how it is, that, if the 
external world is nothing, it presents itself as eating ; 
and why it is, that, if the soul be Brahma, it isUtret, 
aware of the fact, and, more than this, endures various 
miseries. The answer which the Vedantins give to 
this is, that it is all due to the power of ignorance. 
This point I shall now enter upon with somewhat 
of detail. 

The Vedantins assert, that the external world 
originates from ignorance; in other words, it is all 
actually Brahma, but, by reason of ignorance, appears 
to us as the world. Just so, a rope lying in certain 
circumstances may be mistaken, by a man, for a snake. 
He calls it a snake, it not being so, however, but a 
rope : and so one may speak of the snake and the rope 
as being one. And yet it is not meant, that the 
rope has actually undergone a change, or has turned 
into a snake: it is a snake merely in semblance. As 
the rope is to the snake, so is Brahma to the world. 
When, therefore, the Vedantins declare, that the 
world is Brahma, their meaning is not, that Brahma 
is actually transformed into the world, but that, in 
point of fact, the world is no entity; only Brahma 
presents himself as if the world. To use their technical 
phraseology, the world’s existence is not its own, but 
Brahma’s. Hence they designate Brahma as the 



SUMMAEY OF THE VEDANTA ,

illusory-material cause of the world. He is not really 
a material cause, as clay is of the jar which is made out 
of it, but a substrate, as the rope is to the snake, or 
as nacre is to silver, in the stock illustrations of the 
system under description. The existence, the apparent 
existence, of the snake and of the silver depends on 
the existence of the rope and the nacre; and yet 
these are not in reality transmuted, respectively, into 
a snake and into silver Such is the explanation of 
the term illusory-material cause. As for illusion, or 
ignorance, in it we have the world’s material cause , 1 

1 According to this, the world is the vivaria , , or illusory effect, 
of Brahma, and the f anndma, or evolution, of illusion, mayd. 
These two expressions, as denoting acts, are thus explained: 

qfaiwt I feT m 

I Vedanta-paribhasha, p. 11. 

* Evolution is the production of an effect which has the same 
hind of existence as its material cause. Illusory generation 
is the production of an effect which has an existence different 
in kind from that of its material, i. e. illusory-material , 
cause.’ 

It is stated, that some Vedantms formerly maintained Biahma 
to he the material cause of the world. But, from the time 
of Sankara Acharya, the dominant school of the Vedanta ; 
has held, that Brahma is the world’s illusory-material cause.

to the Vedanta, of these five, existence, intelligence, 

things, one may he a material cause, and the other a material 
effect, then Brahma himself may be the material cause of the 
world. For this, Brahma as a material cause, is admitted for 
such m the sense of his being the substrate m misapprehen- 
sion, of the world, i.e. the substrate of the world , the object 
misapprehended since that material causativity which consists 
in evolving is impossible m Brahma , he being without parts. 
Thus, then, the established doctrine is, that the evolutional 
material cause of the world is illusion, not Brahma.’ 

Sankara Acharya often interpiets literally those passages of 
the Upamshads, etc., which seem to speak of Brahma as the 
world’s evolutional material cause ; but he prefers to understand 
them as setting forth the view which, since his time has 
generally, if not universally, been adopted by Yedantins. 
Sankara’s opinion may be learned fiorn what follows : *

joy, name, and form, the first three belong to Brahma, 
and the other two to illusion . 1 The existence, intelli- 
gence, and joy, which appear to be found in all things 
in the universe, are from Brahma, the illusory-material 

foam, a thing developed, existing potentially m water, the 
universe can exist in its material cause, known as pure spirit, 
formless, and undeveloped. Therefore, it is not incongruous 
to think , that the omniscient, himself the mateiial cause of 
names and forms, should create the univeise Otherwise, and 
preferably: as a dexterous juggler without material produces 
himself as it were another self travelling in the air, so the 
omniscient Deva, o» Isvao*a being omnipotent and great in 
illusion, creates himself as it were another self m the form 
of the universe.’ 

Such is the construction put, by Sankara and by all his 
discipular successors, on texts of the Hindu scriptures where 
Brahma is mentioned as a mateiial cau^e. And to this con- 
struction the Vedantins are constrained, as they would render 
consistent either their own tenets or the Upanishads themselves. 
For the Upanishads again and again describe Brahma as being 
without parts, and as unchangeable . and this notion would be 
contravened by that of his being an evolutional material cause. 
Such being the case, in disputing with Vedantins nowadays, 
one will gain nothing by indicating to them, that the prevail- 
ing doctrines of their school are out of harmony with those 
which obtained of yore. Their own doctrines, they will reply, 
do not conflict with those of their predecessors, but only unfold 
and supplement them. One may find, m the Upanishads, 
passages inculcating, that the world is an evolution from 
illusion, and many such things favourable to the position, that 
Brahma is the world’s illusory-material cause only; and the 
pandits will urge, and perhaps justly, that, m arriving at 
their conclusions, they but use different texts for mutual 
explanation.

cause of the universe ; as the existence of nacrine 
silver is from nacre, the illusory-material cause of the 
fancied silver. Name and form, appertaining to the 
universe and its contents, are from illusion, the world’s 
material cause. 1 

The inconsistency and fatuity of the Yedanta, on 
the point under discussion, are most bewildering 
-to the reader. In the first place, he will inquire 
what is the nature of illusion, also called ignorance. 
If, he will say, it is that by reason of which the unreal 
world presents itself as real — after the manner of 
nacre appearing to be silver — it must be misconcep- 
tion : and how can this be the world’s material cause? 
And, if it be a material cause, and if the world was 
made out of it, as a jar is made of a clay, why are 

‘ There are five parts predicable : is, appears, is delightsome, 
form, and name. The first three are of Brahma ; the remain- 
ing two, of illusion.

appearing in external things, are intelligible ; since those things 
are apprehended as existent, and are supposed to minister 
delight. But how can intelligence be said to appear in all 
external things, as in a jar, for instance? The explanation of 
our philosophers is, that, inasmuch as such things appear, their 
appearing is a sign that they are connected with intelligence.

the name and form of the world said to be false ? I 
reply, that the difficulty thus expressed is incapable 
of solution. The Vedantins are herein most inconsist- 
ent. In some respects their ‘ ignorance ’ looks like 
misconception ; and still they will not name it so, but 
the cause of misconception , 1 nay, of the whole world : 
for they describe it as being, like the Sankhya £ nature * 
a complex of the three gunas and the world's material 
cause . 3 Furthermore, they denominate it the power 
of Isvara . 3 These assertions of theirs have little con- 
gruity with each other. 

Another perplexity is offered to the reader, in their 
comparison of Brahma and the world to nacre and to 
nacrine silver severally. That comparison, he must of 
necessity think, could not be intended, by the Vedantins, 
to be taken in its strict literality. For they cannot 
mean, he will say, that the ignorant mistake Brahma 
for the world, just as a man labouring under mis- 
apprehension mistakes nacre for silver. Brahma, he 
will object, is invisible: how, then, can he become an 
object of vision, and be mistaken for the world ? 
Moreover, though a man who takes nacre for silver 
misconceives, yet the form before his eyes is not a

false form, but that of nacre, or, rather, nacre itself. 
Similarly, if it be held, that ‘ignorant’ men take 
Brahma to be the world, though their so taking him 
would be a mistake, it must likewise be believed, 
that this world, visible, tangible, unintelligent, and 
changeable, is Brahma; in other -words, that Brahma 
has these qualities, Let it be granted, that the name 
of the world is false , still, how can its form be so ? 

Difficulties such as these would certainly suggest 
themselves to a person of discrimination ; and they 
are insoluble. At the same time it is true, that the 
comparison lately mentioned is adduced in Vedanta 
treatises of the highest credit, and with the design 
that its literal import should be accepted . 1 We find 

1 To the objection, that Brahma, not being an object of 
vision, cannot be mistaken for the visible world, this reply is 

returned by the Yedantm: ^ =3 Uj> cpj 

31^ 1 ^wtTsfq ^qr£: 

I yedanta-paribhasM, p IS. 4 “How can 

Brahma, the colourless be the object of visual or other per- 
ception?” Let not this be asked; for colour and such other 
things , though colourless, are objects of perception.’ 

It is a maxim of all the Hindu schools, that qualities have 
themselves no qualities ; and hence colour is colourless. There- 
fore, implies the writer here cited, if the possession of colour 
were a condition indispensable to perceptibility, colour would 
be invisible. Sophistry such as this could scarcely be matched. 
But the objector, probably a Naiyayika, who is thus answered, 
maintains, that the condition specified holds only in respect 
of substance, not in respect of quality ; for quality is perceived 
through substance. To this it is rejoined, that Brahma is 
denied to be substantial, and that, consequently, the condition 



SUMMABY OF THE VEDANTA 255 

it asserted there, that, when a man mistakes nacre for 
silver, false silver is actually produced over the nacre. 
The nacre is the substrate of the silver, and is called 
its illusory-material cause; while ignorance is said to 
be its material cause. Analogously, in the estimation 
of the Vedantins, Brahma is universally diffused; and 
over portions of him, the world, a thing of falsity, is 
actually produced : 1 Brahma is its substrate, and its 

does not apply to him. And again, though it were granted, 
that Brahma is substantial, still, like time, which also wants 
colour, he could bo the object of visual and othei percep- 
tion. How time can he such an object, the Vedantm only 
knows. 

l In the Vedanta-pat ibhashd, p 6, wo read, that, in percep- 
» tion, the object perceived becomes non-different from the subject 
of right notion ; but that, m inference, etc., the object does 
not become so. The author’s explanation is this. Non-difference 
from . the subject of right notion does not here mean oneness 
with it, but. the non-possession of an existence distinct from 
that of such subject. To exemplify * since a jar is imagined 
in the intelligence which is appropriated to it, the very 
existence of the jai -appropriated intelligence — technically called 
the object-intelligence — is the existence of the jar. For it is 
not admitted, that the existence of an imagined thing differs 

from that of its substrate: | 

sarcasm 

1 Thus it is shown how the 

object of perception is non-different from the object-intelligence. 
It renaams to show how that object becomes non-different from 
the intelligence which is the subject of right notion. Intelli- 
gence appropriated to the internal organ is called the subject 
of right notion. When an organ of sense, as the eye, impinges 
upon an object, the internal organ is said to evolve, to be 
emitted through the eye, to protend itself to the object, and 



256 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

illusory-material cause ; and ignorance is its material 
cause. The world, thus, is false; and, therefore, so 

to be transformed into its shape. This transformed portion of 
the internal organ is known as an affection. Vide lit supra, 
p. L Along with the internal organ the intelligence thereto 
appropriated is produced to the object perceived ; that is to 
say, as the dimensions of that organ are amplified by the 
evolution, which remains continuous with the source of evolu- 
tion, so increase the limits of the intelligence appropuated to 
the organ m question ; for intelligence being assumed as 
all-pervading, it cannot be said, literally, to have motion. On 
a jar being brought within a house, the jar-appropriated ether 
and the house-appropriated ether become one , they being 
supposed distinct, so long as the jar was outside of the house. 
Similarly, when the internal organ reaches its object, the 
intelligence appropriated to that organ becomes one with the 
object-intelligence , and, since the object is non-different from' 
the object-intelligence, it becomes one with the intelligence 
appropriated to the internal organ, which intelligence is the 
subject of right notion. This does not, however, take place in 
inference ; for, inasmuch as, there, the object does not come 
into contact with an organ of sense, the internal organ is not 
thought to be drawn out to that object through an organ 
of sense. Consequently, as the intelligence appropriated to 
the internal organ does not reach the spot occupied by the 
object intelligence, the two do not become one, nor does 
the object of inference become non-different from the subject 
of right notion. 

From this it is plain, that a portion of Brahma, a portion 
designated as object-intelligence, is considered, by the Vedantins, 
to be external to the beholder, and to take up a determinate 
space; m which portion of Brahma a jar, for instance, is 
imagined, through ignorance, to exist. In this exemplification, 
Brahma and jar are precisely analogous to nacre and the silver 
for which it is mistaken. 

Corresponding language will be found in the Vedanta-pari- 
bhdshd , p. 11, where it is expressed, that it is not the whole 
of intelligence that serves as substrate to apparent silver, but 
only so much of it as is appropriated to the present nacre. 



SUMMABY OF THE VEDANTA 257 

are its name and form. Its existence in one way is 
false, and, in another way, is true : the former, when 
it is viewed as the world ; the latter, when it is viewed 
as Brahma. 1 Hence the Vedantins maintain, that the 
world is false ; and, at the same time, that it is identical 
with Brahma, inasmuch as it is Brahma himself that, 
owing to ignorance, appears as the world. 

As on all other topics, so on that of the nature of 
soul, the Vedanta doctrine presents a variety of 
opinions. The principal, of which all the rest are 
modifications, are these two. 2 Some say, that a portion, 
of Brahma, or of the pure spirit, appropriated to the 
internal organ, constitutes the soul ; 3 others, that it 
is a reflexion of Brahma in the internal organ. 4 It 

Though nacre is, in a certain sense, viewed as the substrate 
of nacrine silver, yet Brahma also, the substrate of everything 
practical and apparent, is so, and in a truer sense, by virtue 
of his being the sole veritable entity. 

It should never for a moment he forgotten, that, with the 
Vedantins, intelligence always means Brahma. 

i If it be asked, whether the existence apprehended in suoh 
a cognition as ‘A jar is’ be that which belongs to Brahma, 
and is true, or that which belongs to the world, and is false; 
the Vedantin’s answer is two-fold, according to two several 
theories. The first theory is, that it is Brahma’s true existence 
which is there cognized ; the second, that it is the world’s 
false existence. See the two passages from the Vedanta - 
paribhasM, cited at pp. 237-8.

258 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

will be made evident, in the sequel, that on close 
examination, the internal organ, taken by itself, is 
found to possess, in the tenets of the Vedantins, those 
characteristics which are referable to the soul, and 
by which we recognize the soul as such. The views 
in question, of what makes up the soul, are always 
inculcated as just described ; and yet the importation 
into them of the Brahma-element, or reflexion of 
Brahma, is altogether deceptive. And this Brahma- 
element, or the reflexion of Brahma, it is taught, is 
hot the adjective part of the soul, but its substantive 
part. This opinion the Vedantins, building on a 
maxim which will be cited in the fifth chapter, and 
recurred to in the seventh, believe themselves justified 
in entertaining. 

When these theories, as has been said, are thoroughly 
scrutinized, the soul turns out to be the internal 
organ. And, if it be so, or even if it be a reflexion of 
Brahma, can it be one with him? The answer, in 
consonance with Vedanta notions, to this interrogatory 
will be seen in the seventh chapter. 

With reference to the soul, the Vedantins hold, that, 


The theory of reflexion is to be understood in its strict 
material liter ality. This appears from the subjoined objection 

and its answer: rf Tt sr^ofr Jr 

I Ibid., p. 42. ‘ “ A reflexion of Brahma, 

he being colourless, cannot be; for it, a reflexion , is seen of 
that only which has colour.” Let not this be asserted; 
since a reflexion is seen of colour, itself colourless,’ 



SUMMARY OF THE VEDANTA 


259 


though it is Brahma, yet, being subject to illusion, or 
ignorance, it has forgotten its true nature, and, looking 
upon the internal organ and the body as real, and 
identifying itself with them, considers itself to be 
man, or the like. And, although all things in vicissi- 
tudinous life are false, from ignorance soul thinks 
them true, and calls some of them mine, and the 
rest others’, and imagines that some things make it 
happy, and that others render it miserable. It being 
thus, there arise, in the soul, desire and aversion, in 
consequence of which it engages in good works and 
in bad. Afterwards, to receive the requital of those 
works, it has to pass to Elysium, or to Hell, and to 
take birth repeatedly. All these experiences and 
mutations are, to be sure, false : l but, nevertheless, 
they seem to it as true ; and hence is all its 
wretchedness. 

Again, the Vedantins, like the other System atists, 
maintain, that the soul has been, from all eternity, in 
the bondage of illusion. They do not say, that 
illusion, or ignorance, came into being at some par- 
ticular period, and took the soul captive. Eor, if it 
thus had origin, it would be necessary to assign a 
cause of its origin; and, besides, even after being

emancipated, it might, in consequence of the produc- 
tion of some new ignorance, incur jeopardy of being 
taken captive afresh. On this ground they allege, 
that illusion has existed from beyond all duration of 
time, 1 and that, co-eternally with it, the soul has been 
enthralled, and will thus continue until emancipated. 
But how is this notion, that illusion has always 
existed, reconcilable with the position, that, besides 
Brahma, one without a second, nothing ever has been, 
or is, or is to be? What, further, becomes of the 
position, that Brahma is, in his nature, eternally pure, 
intelligent, and free? For the soul is Brahma, and 
yet, having been in bondage to illusion from all 
eternity, is impure and unintelligent. With a view 
to repel these objections, the Yedantins declare, that 
illusion is a thing of so peculiar a character, that at 
once neither does it exist nor does it not exist. It 
cannot be said to be, inasmuch as it does not 
possess true existence. On the other hand, it 
cannot be said not to be, inasmuch as it possesses 
the existence called apparent. 2 This is what they 

1 See the first foot-note at p. 49 

2 Practical and apparent existence, it has been shown, do 
not at all differ from each other, as regards reality, or falsity. 
Hence, it is all one, in effect, whether the Yedantins call a 
thing practical, or whether they call it apparent. The author 
confesses, that he has seen no passage to support him in 
classing illusion among, apparent objects; nor would he 
spontaneously have thought of thus classing it. The authority 
of an eminent Yedantin led him to take the view here 
assumed as correct. The fact, that illusion never comes into 
play in practical transactions, may have induced the Yedantins 
to consider it as apparent.

mean in saying, that ‘ Illusion cannot be set forth 
as being either existent or non-existent .’ 1 By this 
device they would preserve intact the dogma of non- 
duality, and also make out Brahma to be, in his 
nature, ever pure, intelligent, and free, and at the 
same time would account for the thraldom of the soul, 
and its consequent round of trials. For illusion, 
though it has apparent existence, has not really real 
existence; and so the dogma of monism suffers no in- 
jury. Again, though illusion has not really real exist- 
ence, yet it possesses apparent existence ; and so it 
is capable of taking the soul captive. And again, the 
Vedantins say, that, as illusion is only apparent, so 
the soul’s being fettered is practical ; that is, as illu- 
sion is false, so the soul’s being fettered is likewise 
false. Neither was the soul ever actually fettered, 
nor is it now fettered, not has it to be emanci- 
pated. 3

Accordingly, I warn my readers against being

that, according to the "Vedanta, Brahma was once void 
of qualities, and then, assuming them, made the world :

and that some small portion of the pure, Brahma 
parted from him, got deluded by illusion, and then 
became soul's, which souls, when they free themselves 
from illusion, will be united to Brahma, etc. The 
teachers of the Vedanta do not allege, that Brahma was 
once void of qualities, and subsequently, taking them 
upon him, formed the universe ; but they allege, that 
to be without them has ever distinguished him, and 
ever will distinguish him . 1 Equally, his possession 
of qualities, and his operating the origin, continuance, 
destruction, etc., of the world, are from everlasting; 
for herein the Vedanta is consentient with the other 
Systems. But his having no qualities is true 
( pdramarthika ), and his having qualities is practical. 
The former is really real: whereas the other is not 
so ; it arising simply from the imputation, by the igno- 
rant, to Brahma, of what does not belong to him. 
Nor is it asserted, that, at some period, a part of 
Brahma was separated off, fell into the snare of illusion, 
and became soul. The accredited doctrine is, that 
neither Brahma nor any portion 2 of him can ever be 


1 See the passage cited at p. 49 * Among the six things there 
reckoned as beginningless, the pure Brahma is included. Often 
in most Vedanta writers, but with especial frequency in the 
works of Sankara Acharya, the epithet of * ever and essentially 
pure, intelligent, and free,’ mtyasuddha-buddha-muTtta-vdblid- 
vam , is found applied to Brahma. 

Buddha is here metonymical ; since, in strictness, Brahma 
is held to be bodha , ‘ intelligence,’— not ‘intelligent’. 

2 Pure Brahma, it is maintained, is without parts. In the 
M&ndtikya-upamshad, Brahma is spoken of as of four parts ; 
three, as the soul (jiv&tman ), which experiences three states, 
those of waking, dreaming, and sleeping insensibly ; and one,

truly beguiled by illusion. 1 And yet the soul has 
always been what it is, distinct from Brahma, 2 and 
has always been ensnared by illusion, or ignorance, 
coeval with itself. Nevertheless, the soul is Brahma* 
and always has been so , and wherever it is found 
called a part of Brahma, such language is used only 
from the standing point of practical existence. 
Strictly speaking, the soul, in the sense in which it 

as pure Brahma. Ananda Giri thus introduces two sentences of 
Sankara Acharya, where commenting on the passage adverted to.

is Brahma, is not so merely as a part of him, but 
as the whole ; and, in the sense in which it is not 
Brahma, it is no part of Brahma regarded as a whole, 
but is entirely distinct from him. Nay, rather than 
speak of it as being distinct from Brahma, it ought 
to be said, simply, that it is not Brahma. For, from 
the aspect from which it is not Brahma, Brahma 
does not exist at all : and how, then, can it be spoken 
of as distinct from Brahma ? The case is like that 
of nacrine silver, when thought to be genuine silver: 
it not being, to the beholder, nacre at all ; wherefore 
he will not say, that it is distinct from nacre. In the 
same way, pure Brahma, contemplated from the 
standing point of practical existence, has no existence 
whatever : there is no Brahma, except him that has 
qualities, or Isvara, the maker of the world ; to which 
are to be added the world and souls, all quite 
separate one from another. From that point of view, 
it is, then, wrong to speak of the soul as being sepa- 
rate from the pure Brahma. Therefore, though the 
soul, from the standing point of practical existence, 
has always existed as soul, from the standing point of 
true existence, it has always been veritably Brahma. 
And, though the soul has always been Brahma, yet 
neither to Brahma, nor to any part of him, has there 
ever attached, or can there ever attach, in any way, 
the least ignorance or alterability. Evermore, in his 
nature, does he remain altogether pure, intelligent, 
and free. 

From all this it will be patent to the reader, that 
the Vedantin not only holds the ignorance-imagined 
world, and its maker, Isvara, to be practical and 



266 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


false, but maintains, also, that the imaginer of the 
world and of its maker, namely, ignorance, is appa- 
rent and false. The imagining the world and its 
maker is that which makes soul to be soul; and 
hence the soul, as soul, is practical and false: the 
one Brahma, in his nature ever pure, intelligent, 
and free, alone is true. If, then, it be asked, how it 
can be, that the soul has, from all eternity, been in 
captivity to ignorance, and yet is Brahma; he being, 
however, unchangeably pure : the answer is, that, 

assuredly, it cannot be , only the misguided Vedantins 
think that it can. Ignorance, by reason of which the 
soul, the world, and Isvara appear, according to them, 
to exist, they believe to be false, that is, to be noth- 
ing; and, of course, there is nothing that can derive 
impurity or change to Brahma. This will be clearly 
explained, over and over again, in coming chapters ; 
and so it is unnecessary to dwell on it further on 
this occasion. And it is highly material that the 
reader should take notice, that the tenet of the 
falseness of ignorance is the very key-stone of the 
Vedanta, and must never be lost from view for a 
single moment. In constantly recurring to it, as I 
do in this book, I may be supposed, to lay myself 
open to the charge of tedious and useless repetition. 
The tenet referred to is, however, not only one of 
paramount moment, but also difficult to grasp and to 
retain ; and, if it be not mastered, the Vedanta is 
impossible to be understood. 

Further, I would beg the reader to believe, that 
the Vedanta, however perspicuously expounded, is 
most bewildering. Some of my own countrymen, and

foreigners, in particular, if they read what; I write, 
may conclude, as the result of a hasty glance, that 
I have set down many things without having grounds 
for them, and that I have spun enigmas out of my 
own brains. All such I entreat to avoid a hasty 
judgement, and to go through my volume patiently 
and attentively. They will then, I suspect, change 
their minds. If, in one place where it is looked for, 
my authority for a statement be found wanting, it 
will be seen produced elsewhere, and more appro- 
priately; and, if I do not solve all objections as fast 
as they arise, still I trust, that a careful perusal of 
my entire treatise will leave few doubts undispelled. 

And now I wish to mention one or two things 
that are very likely to occur to foreigners who give 
their attention to the "Vedanta and the other Hindu 
Systems. In the first place, there are many expres- 
sions, in the treatises on these systems, the precise 
sense of which they will not apprehend; and, in the 
second place, when they come upon glaring absurdities 
and incongruities, refusing to see them in their true 
light, they will give them such a turn as to render 
everything most reasonable and excellent. Whoso 
would acquaint himself with the philosophical opinions 
peculiar to a strange country, should by no means 
content himself with simply reading a book or two, 
whether by himself, or with aid, and then at once 
set to theorizing about them. If he wishes to under- 
stand those opinions really and thoroughly, he must 
apply himself perseveringly, for several years, to the 
study of works in which they are set forth ; and he must 
mix familiarly with the people who profess them, until, 



268 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


by frequent converse, he learns how those people are 
affected and influenced by their views , and he must 
hear them speak about them without constraint, and 
spontaneously. In short, he must, as it were, become 
one of themselves; and then, and not till then, can 
he certify himself, that he has actually got at the 
true purport and import of their belief. Leaving this 
digression, I shall address myself to what remains to 
be said on the Vedanta doctrine of the soul. 

According to the Vedantins, when the soul, bound 
by illusion, becomes convinced, that the world is false, 
and that itself is Brahma, existent, intelligence, and 
joy, it escapes from further vicissitude, and realizes 
Brahmahood. But, even after the acquisition of this 
knowledge, the soul has to tenant the body, till it 
exhausts the experience of its fructescent works; and 
so long it cannot evade happiness and misery. This 
experience exhausted, it obtains disembodied isolation, 
plenary emancipation. In thus determining, the 
Vedanta is in unison with all the other Systems; and 
also in prescribing purity of intellect as indispensable 
to emancipative knowledge. This purity is the fruit 
of good works, such as repetition of sacred names, 
austerities, and pilgrimage, kept up during several 
births. 1 In order to gaining emancipative knowledge,

the practice of devotion likewise is prescribed. The 
accounts of Isvara, found in the Puranas and other 
books, as that he assumed the forms of Vishnu, Siva, 
etc., and achieved various actions, are also respected 
by the Vedantins ; 1 who, again, hold it proper to go 
through the sacrifices and other ceremonies enjoined 
in the Veda. They declare, however, like the other 
Systematists, that, if a man estranges himself from 
the world, and gives himself wholly to spiritual studies 
and exercises, and becomes an ascetic, he must desist 
from all ritualism. Still they do not impugn the 
ceremonial portion of the Veda as folly. Notwith- 
standing the ritual renunciation of the ascetic, as 
has been mentioned, it is not deemed improper for 
him to engage in mental devotion addressed to 
Vishnu, Mahadeva, and other first-class deities, forms 
of Kvara. Whoever, therefore, hearing, that the 
Vedantins believe in Brahma without qualities, infer, 
that they reject Vishnu, Siva, and the rest of the 
pantheon, and that they discountenance idolatry and 
such things, and that they count the Puranas and 
similar writing false, labours under gross error . 2

2 Sankara Acharya, while engaged in refuting the Bhagavatas,

that moiety is discrepant from the Vedanta, and acknowledges as 
commendable the whole of its ritualism. His words are these :

these are all real authoritative. Erom the standing

looked upon as false. Such are the leading dogmas 
of the Vedanta.

CHAPTER III 


Examination of the Vedanta Views concerning the 
Supreme Spirit. 

The first article of the Vedanta creed, as it has 
been given, is, that ‘Brahma is true’. However, the 
Vedantins, in denying all qualities to him, render 
him such, that it is impossible to prove his existence. 
When they hear us ascribe to the Supreme Spirit in- 
telligence, will, power, and other attributes, and speak 
of Him as Maker of the world, they silently deride us, 
in the conviction, that we are lamentably ignorant: 
for our views, to their thinking, impute imperfection 
to Him, in giving Him qualities ; and they suppose, 
that we, at the best and furthest, stop short at Isvara, 
and make no approach to the pure Brahma beyond. 
But they do not consider, that such a Supreme Spirit 
as they contend for cannot be proved to exist. From 
the world, an effect, it must be inferred, that it had 
an efficient cause: hence God, its Maker. By what 
argumentation can one establish the existence of a 
being transcending Him, a being not a maker? More- 
over, I would ask the Vedantin in what sort we 
charge imperfection on the Supreme Spirit, in ascribing 



272 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

to Him such attributes as omnipotence and omnis- 
cience? And, if Brahma be void of all qualities, on 
what ground is he supposed to be ulterior to the 
Creator? Eorabeing without qualities, if conceivable, 
cannot be deemed either excellent or otherwise. But, 
waiving this, it is certain, as was said, that Brahma 
without qualities cannot be proved an entity. Percep- 
tion tells us nothing of him; and inference teaches 
us no more , since he has no relation with anything. 
Por, agreeably to the Vedantin’s definition, Brahma 
is related to nothing, either as cause, or in any other 
way. 

It might be supposed, by some, that, since the 
Vedantins call Brahma the substrate of the world, it 
is wrong to say, that they deny his relativity. I reply, 
that the sublime conception, that God is the state of 
the world, is indeed, most true. But neither true 
nor sublime is the notion of the Vedantins, that 
Brahma is the world’s substrate. They mean, that 
he is so, just as nacre is the substrate of fancied 
silver. As nacre is mistaken for silver, so is Brahma 
mistaken for the world. Again, let it be ever kept 
in mind, that, by the Brahma whom the Vedantins 
called the world’s substrate, or illusory-material cause, 
is ordinarily meant, not the pure Brahma, now under 
discussion, but Brahma the illusion-appropriated, or 
illusion-associated, 1 Is vara, who is ignorance-imagined 
and false. 

q£I?Fsrfi[(5riq; I Vedinta-paniUsM, p. 44. ‘ Brahma himself 



VEDANTA AND THE SUPREME SPIRIT 273 


The Vedantins are, however, forced to look upon 
the pure Brahma also as the ultimate substrate of 
all Since Brahma the illusion-associated, and like- 
wise the illusion which is his associate, are ignorance- 
imagined and false, a substrate must be found for 
them, and it can be found, we are told, in the pure 
Brahma, 1 and nowhere else. But this pure Brahma 
is not held to be, consciously, and by virtue of his 
will and power, the cause of the universe to which 
he stands in the relation of substrate. 2 So well- 
known, in fact, is it, that Brahma has no activity, 

is the material cause, i. e. the 'illusory -material cause , of a jar, 
or the like ; for this illusion-associated intelligence extends 
to all jars, and so forth.’ 
i See the extract from Ananda Giri at p. 264. 

* As is stated in the text, the Vedantins ordinarily speak of 
the illusion-associated Brahma, Is'vara, as the world's illusory- 
material cause ; but, it must he understood it is his pure-Brahma 
portion that is held to be so. The illusory-material cause of 
the world — which world is reckoned false— must be a true 
entity ; and, inasmuch as the illusion-associated Brahma, as 
such, is false, and so the world likewise, he cannot, as 
associated with illusion, be its illusory-material cause. Tbe 
Vedantins are compelled to maintain, that his pure-Brahma 
portion is, here, alone to be taken account of. On other 
occasions, however, all that is predicated of this being, Isvara, 
is referred to his illusion-portion ; as, for instance, the 
conscious and efficient causativity of the world, omniscience,. 

omnipotence, etc., etc.

will, and other qualities, that it ought not to be ex- 
pected of me to adduce authority for what I assert. 
However, I will quote a passage in proof. The 
author of the Sankshepa-scf-riraka, after battling along 
with the Gaiseshikas on the point in question, thus 
delivers his own doctrine : ‘ Moreover, from the son 
of Anakadundubhi — announced in the Veda; outreach- 

by science, i.e. right apprehension. And its “play" is a certain 
affection therefrom produced, in the shape of the supreme 
Isvara’s beholding, or apprehension , will, and activity ; by 
which three l&vara makes the loorld 

Similarly, the limited apprehension, will, activity, etc., of 
Brahma appropriated to the internal organ, in other words, 
of soul, are referred to the soul’s internal-organ portion, not 
to its Brahma-portion. 

Hence, when the Vedantins, ascribe illusory-material caus- 
ativity to the illusion-associated Brahma, they consider him 
as indeed a conscious and efficient cause; but since, only as 
illusion-associated, he is such a cause — namely, since conscions 
and efficient causativity appertains to his illusion-portion only— 
as a conscious and efficient cause, he is false. 

Again, the Vedantins, as mentioned above, ultimately ascribe 
illusory-material causativity to the pure Brahma, whom they 
indeed count a true entity: only he is, avowedly, devoid of 
all that constitutes a conscious and efficient cause. 

The reason why the Vedantins generally refer to the illusion- 
associated Brahma the illusory-material causativity of the 
world, is this. Brahma, it is laid down, possesses such caus- 
ativity, in the sight of the ignorant only, by whom the world is 
reputed to be real. To such, the material cause of the world, 
or illusion, is likewise real ; and, in like manner, Brahma is, 
to them, necessarily associated with illusion. Consequently, 
when Brahma the illusion-associated is spoken of as the 
illusory-material cause of the world, it is not intended, that 
he, as such, is such a cause, hut solely as pure Brahma: and 
yet, to the ignorant, he is not, in fact, unassociated Brahma, 
hut Brahma associated with illusion.

No MS of the Sankshepa-sdrimka is just now accessible for

By ‘son of Anakadundubhi ’ is meant Krishna. 

The earlier Vedantins, Sankara Aeharya and his proximate 
followers, were — as will be seen in a coming note — Vaishnava, 
and held Vishnu, or Krishna, to be the Supreme Spirit 
himself. They use the word Vasudeva, a name of Krishna, 
as a synonym of Brahma. 

Thus, Sankara, commenting on the Katka-upanishad, says: 

NO 

Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. VIII, p. 114. ‘ Of “ Vishnu ”, known 
as Vasudeva,-— pervader of all , Brahma, the Supreme Spirit.’ 

Vasudeva, as a word, means ‘son of Vasudeva’. The 
Vedantins, however, try to force from it, etymologically, various 
senses available for epithets of Brahma. The author of the 
Sankshepa-Sdriraka, one of the elder Vedantin doctors, expresses 
and implies, throughout his book, that Vishnu is the supreme 
Brahma of his own school. But Siva, he says, is the I^vara 
of the Vaiseshika and other anti-vaidxka denominations: 

TrfcWcIT I'WStsr:

In the stanza at the beginning of this note, he puts ‘ son 
of Anakadundubhi ’ for Vasudeva, because the latter word 
was refractory to his prosody. Anakadundubhi, otherwise called 
Vasudeva, was father of Vasudeva, that is to say, Krishna. 

By the application of the term vaidika to Vasudeva, it is 
intimated, that Krishna is the supreme Brahma of the 
Vedantins.

world produced unconsciously from the son of Anaka- 
dundubhi? The answer is, precisely as silver is pro- 
duced from nacre; not as an effect owes its origin 
to a conscious agent. Hence I maintain, that, if 
Brahma be not conscious creator of the world, or its 
stay, otherwise than as nacre is to silver, that is to 
say, in spite of himself, to establish that such a 
substrate exists is not to make out, that Brahma, as 
essentially existence, intelligence, and joy, is an entity. 
To prove, that any being is such a stay of the world 
as the Vedantins talk of, it must first of all be shown, 
that the world is illusory. And, though the world 
be so considered, how is it determined, that its stay, 
or substrate, which is mistaken for the world, a visible 
and material thing, is void of qualities, impassable, 
without form, immutable, essentially existence, intelli- 
gence, and joy, as the Yedantins describe Brahma ? 

Now, the Supreme Spirit, God, whom the Bible 
calls the Upholder of the world, is not so as nacre 
is to silver, or as the ground is to a jar, or as a thing 
qualified is to its qualities, or as its threads are to 
a web. He is called the world's Upholder, because by 
His wondrous and inscrutable will and might the world 
is supported. As it did not originate spontaneously, 
so neither is it self-sustaining, but is upheld by the 
constant exercise of the Divine Will. To speak 
figuratively, the hand of His will holds up its existence. 
Let that hand be withdrawn but for a single instant, 
and it would at once fall into non-existence. Such is 

As, in the chapter here cited from, the Vedanta theory is 
set in opposition to the Vaiseshika, etc., so is Krishna set in 
opposition to §iva. 



VEDANTA AND THE SUPEEMB SPIKIT 277 


the exalted sense in which the Bible speaks of God 
as the Stay of the world ; as where it says ; * In Him 
we live, and move, and have our being.’ From other 
passages of Holy Writ, where God is mentioned as 
the Creator and Upholder of the world, it is evident 
what meaning we are to assign to the text just cited. 
How wide, then, is the difference between the Vedanta 
doctrine, on the point here discussed, and the doctrine 
of the Bible ! 

But, over and above all tbis, it should not be for- 
gotten, that, in the estimation of the Vedantins, the 
pure Brahma’s being even the unconscious substrate 
of the universe is not true (paramfirthilca). For the 
ignorance by which he is imagined to be such a 
substrate, is itself maintained to be false ! 1 a position 
necessary for the integrity of monism. Strictly speak- 
ing, then, there is not even so much of a connexion 
between the pure Brahma and the universe as seemed, 
a minute ago, to be promised. This is strange absurd- 
ity ; but I am not responsible for it. I take the 
Vedanta as I find it, and trace its principles to their 
issues. 

And let no one suppose, that the places in the Up- 
anishads and other Vedanta works, where an omniscient 
or omnipotent being, or the conscious and efficient 
cause of the world, is spoken of, are claimed, by the 
Vedantins, as referring to their pure Brahma. On 
the contrary, they assert, that their Xsvara is there 
meant. Names which they give to him are, Brahma 
with qualities, Brahma adulterate, illusion-associated 


i This will be shown in the eighth chapter. 



278 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

Brahma, illusive Brahma, 1 * and even supreme Brahma 
and Supreme Spirit. For— -as should be distinctly kept 
in mind — it is the supreme Brahma himself, imagined, 
by ignorance, as associated with illusion, as creating 
the world, and as endowed with the attributes of 
omniscience, etc., that is, Isvara. 

The case of the soul, and that of the world, are, 
however, precisely like that of Isvara; for the soul 
and the world are nothing but Brahma mistaken for 
them. Why, then, is Isvara, in a more special and 
eminent sense than the soul and the world, considered 
to be one with Brahma ? The Vedantin would reply, 
this his system persuasively accommodates its language, 
when addressed to the vulgar, to their erroneous 
views The vulgar are not conscious, that they call 4 
the Supreme Spirit himself soul and the world; but 
they are conscious, that they believe him to be the 
omnipotent and omniscient creator But what I think 
to be the true reason is this ; that, though the Vedantin, 
in order to save monism, is forced upon the invention, 
that Brahma is void of qualities, yet his inner con- 
sciousness does not acquiesce in this position. Hence 
he is involuntarily led to speak of Brahma and 
Isvara promiscuously, as if they were the same. 

The first of the Vedanta Aphorisms, to be sure, 
professes to inquire about Brahma ; and the second 
defines him to be author of the world’s origin, sub- 
sistence, and end. Yet it must not be inferred, from 
this, that the Vedantins really so conceive of their 

l See the first extract from Inanda Giri, cited at p. 220*

pure Brahma. It is not, that the essential nature 
of the pure Brahma is there defined; but a false 
character is imputed to him, with intent to point 
out his true nature from afar. 1 

1 The Vedantins have two sorts of definitions of Brahma, The 
first, svarupa-lahshana , describes his true nature, and is worded, 
* existent, intelligence, and joy \ The other definition, that 
in question, is called tatastha-lakshana. Tatastha signifies 
{ standing on the shore \ True to the metaphor, such a 
definition denotes a characteristic which, though not in fact 
inhering in the thing defined, approximates to it, and indicates 
it. The ordinary illustration represents a man as pointing 
out the new moon to another, by directing him to look at a 
certain branch of a certain tree. 

Bamananda Sarasvatl, expounding the commentary on the 
second aphorism of the Brahma-sutra , mentioned above, 

writes thus: 5R1WR eR?f

this be asked, the reply is: In like manner as silver is a

mistaken for silver is nacre,” so, in the proposition, “That 
which is mistaken for the cause of the world is Brahma,** 
imaginary causativity is a merely suggestive characteristic of 
Brahma. Thus is all unimpeachable.* 

Thus it is declared, that Brahma is held to he author of 
the world*s origin, continuance, and end, just as nacre is 
nacrine silver.

of the Yedanta-pcmbMshd, pp. 34-5, may appear, to a hurried

It might be thought, from this, that, however, the causativity 
of the universe does not always appertain to Brahma, still it 
appertains to him at some particular period or periods ; as 
odour, the earth. But the reader cannot be too often cautioned, 
that the expressions of the Vedantins are frequently most 
deceptive. What has just been stated is, suitably to the 
Vedanta, true as far as it goes , only it is not the whole truth, 
Brahma’s causativity of the world’s origin, etc., is, to be sure, 
non-eternal, even as the developed universe itself is non-eternal. 
Both the causativity and the universe are, however, not only 
non-eternal, but false They are only ignorance-imagined ; and, 
immediately on the acceding of right apprehension, they are 
falsified, or proved to be nothing. For this very reason they

and the consequence is duality . Else, the scriptural declara- 
tions of creation come to be falsified.” Not so. The passages 
which speak of creation do not aim to teach the verity of 
creation, but to impart a knowledge of the seeondless Brahma. 
How is the description of creation subservient to the knowledge

of Mm? In this wise, If the existence of the universe in 
Brahma were denied, and creation were not mentioned, the 
surmise might arise, that the universe, denied to exist in 
Brahma, exists somewhere else , even as colour, though denied 
to exist in the air, exists in other things ; and thus an indubi- 
table account of non-duality would not have been given. 
Hence, when it is ascertained, from the passages concerned 
with creation, that the universe is a material effect, viz., an 
illusory-material effect, of Brahma, the surmise, that the universe , 
the material effect, could exist elsewhere than in Brahma , the 
material cause, is dispelled. Then , by the statement, in “Hot 
it, not it,” and other scriptural passages , of the non-existence 
of it, the universe, in Brahma also, the utter nihility of the 
universe being ascertained, Brahma— freed from all suspicion 
of duality ; mipartite ; the existent, intelligence, and joy, 
unalloyed with aught else— is established. Thus, the aim of 
even the passages relating to creation is, to set forth, indirectly, 
Brahma as without a second. The object of the passages read 
in the devotional sections of the TJpanishads , which announce 
Brahma with qualities, is, simply to impute qualities falsely 
to Brahma, which qualities are demanded by the injunctions to 
devotion ; and their object is not to teach that he is possessed 
of qualities. As for the use of the passages read in sections 
of the TJpanishads taken up with Brahma without qualities, 
which passages speak of him as having qualities, it is, to 
indicate, supplementarily, the object denied, viz., qualities which 
object is demanded by the passages denying qualities, to Brahma » 
Thus no passage whatever is inconsistent with the declaration 
of Brahma as secondless.’ 

The Vedantins, accordingly, discourse of Brahma’s causativity, 
and other qualities, simply with intent to confirm the idea of 
their entire nonentity, 

v It will be sufficiently clear, from what precedes, how essentially 
Dr. J, R. Ballantyne has misapprehended the purport of the 
Vedanta system. ‘ So far,’ he says, * is the conception of 
Brahma from being reduced to that of a nonentity by the Vedtotio 
tenet of his being nirguna , that, according to one of Vyasa's 
aphorisms, as rendered by Mr. Colebrooke ( Essays , p, 352), 
41 Every attribute of a first cause (omniscience, omnipotence, 
etc.), exists in Brahme , who is devoid of qualities.” It is 



VEDANTA AND TEE SUPEEME SPIEIT 283 


their Isvara to be altogether false. They regard illu- 
sion-appropriated Brahma as Isvara. 1 A part of him 
may be false; but how can that other part of him, 
which is Brahma, be so ? In reply, I ask, whether 
they do not maintain, that Brahma as appropriated 
to the internal organ constitutes the soul? And why 
do they call the soul false ? The reason is this. They 
assert, that Brahma, as appropriated to the internal: 
organ, or else as reflected in it, constitutes the soul; 
and yet they deny, that Brahma is truly so appropri- 
ated, or reflected; there being, according to them, no 
true contact between Brahma and the internal organ, 
but only an erroneously imputed contact ; since, like 
the rest of the world, the internal organ is false. 
Hence, though the soul is called Brahma appropriated 
to the internal organ, still, since his appropriation 
to the internal organ is false, the soul as soul is false. 
Similarly, though they call Brahma appropriated to 
illusion Isvara, they declare, that the contact of illusion 
with Brahma is not true, but merely imagined. Hence, 
with them, Isvara is Brahma appropriated to illusion; 
and yet they believe their Isvara’s appropriation to 
illusion to be imaginary ; and, therefore, their Isvara 
is imaginary, namely, imagined by ignorance. According 
to their opinion, even the false Isvarahood of this 

rather strange, that the occurrence of this passage in. Mr, 
Golebrooke’s well-known essay should not have sufficed to awaken 
a suspicion, that the term “ devoid of qualities ” must be 
employed in a sense other than that of an empty substratum — 
a nonentity .’ — Christianity contrasted , etc., p. 4=6.

illusion-appropriated Isvara belongs to his illusion- 
portion, not to his Brahma-portion; in like manner 
as the false activity, experience of happiness and 
misery, and other qualities of the imagined mternaL 
organ-appropriated soul, reside in its internal-organ- 
portion, not in its Brahma-portion. When, therefore, 
they call Isvara maker of the world and omnipotent, 
it must be understood, that they deny activity and 
other qualities to his Brahma-portion. 

Sometimes the Vedantins give to illusion the appella- 
tion of power of Isvara. Still, it does not inhere in 
the true nature of Isvara, his Brahma-portion, in the 
way we hold, that power inheres m one who is 
powerful. Por we regard this connexion as true ; 
but the connexion between Brahma and illusion is 
false. It is distinctly stated, in the Vedanta~sara , that, 
as a snake is erroneously surmised in a cord, just so 
the entire universe, beginning with ignorance, is 
erroneously surmised in Brahma. 1 Here, it should 
be observed, ignorance itself is comprehended in the 
universe, the object of erroneous surmise. By ignor- 
ance, as will be seen by the reader of the Vedanta- 
sara t illusion — ■ which is the material cause of the 
world, often denominated the power of Isvara — is here 
intended. 

Not except by apprehending these mysterious matters

VEDANTA AND THE SUPEEME SPIBIT 285 


by its language. To make good this assertion, I 
produce a passage on the subject of ignorance-asso- 
ciated intelligence, or Isvara. It is this : ‘ Intelligence, 
associated with ignorance, when the former is chiefly 
considered, is the efficient cause; and, when its asso- 
ciate is so considered, the material cause : as the 
spider, when itself is chiefly considered, is the efficient 
cause, and, when its body, whence its web is derived , 
is so considered, the material cause, as regards its 
thread, the effect.’ 1 On reading this, one of the un- 
initiated will express himself in this wise. ‘Here, 
plainly enough, two statements are put forth touch- 
ing Isvara. His body— ignorance, or illusion— is called 
the material cause of the world ; and himself, the 
efficient cause of the world, or its maker. And what 
is he, in distinction from ignorance, his body, but 
pure Brahma? And does it not follow, that this pure 
Brahma is accounted maker of the world ? ’ I reply, 
that no one who has fathomed the Vedanta doctrine 
can come to such a conclusion as is thus implied. 
By way of explanation, I will first show how, accord- 
ing to the Vedantin, the case stands, in its fulness, 
as regards the spider ; and then, how the illustration 
of the spider and hiB web is applicable, according

to the Vedantin, in respect of Isvara. It must be 
understood, that, in the view of the Vedantin as the 
human soul is, in fact, ever pure, intelligent, and free 
Brahma, precisely, so is the self, or soul, of the spider. 
Hence, as activity and other qualities belong to the 
human soul only by erroneous imputation, 1 only thus 
do they belong to the soul of the spider: there being 
no true connexion between those qualities and soul ; 
for those qualities are properties of the internal organ. 
How, then, are we to explain, that) the spider, i.e. 
the spider’s soul, is called an efficient cause? The 
answer is, that its causativity is accounted for by 
erroneous imputation. Then, an objector may urge, 
the efficient causativity and material causativity of the 
spider both appertain to its body: for the internal organ 
is called the subtile body, and it must, therefore, be

regarded as body ; and, this being the case, why is 
a distinction taken between the spider and its body, 
and the former called efficient cause, and the latter, 
material cause? My reply is that, in the passage of 
the Vedmta-sam under discussion, the exoteric notion 
is adopted. For, when the Vedantins speak of the 
origin of the world, for instance, they do not believe 
its origin to be true. This mode of expression they 
call false imputation. It consists in holding for true 
that which is false, in accommodation to the intelli- 
gence of the uninitiated. At a further stage of in- 
struction, when the time has arrived for propounding 
the esoteric view, the false imputation is gainsaid: 
and this gainsaying is termed rescission. 1 The soul 
of the spider has no true efficient eausativity ; and 
yet everybody considers the spider as possessing it. 
Hence, with reference to common opinion, such causa- 
tivity is falsely imputed to him, and he is called 
an efficient cause. The qualities of his external and 
gross corporeal frame are, however, never attributed 
to his soul : his body being regarded, by all, as distinct 
from his soul. 2 Hence, when the author of the 

1 * False imputation ’ and 1 rescission ’ have been selected to 
represent adhymopa and apavdda. 

2 As for the Charvakas, and the profoundly ignorant, who 
take the gross body itself to be the soul, they are scarcely 
worthy of the notice of the Vedantin, who especially shapes 
his instruction to meet the supposed wants of the Naiyayikas 
and similar philosophers. These, the Vedantin says, though 
wise enough to distinguish the soul from the gross body, are, 
nevertheless, unable to distinguish it from the internal organ, 
and attribute to the soul the qualities which belong exclusively 
to that organ, viz., apprehension, will, activity, etc. See, further, 
what Vijnana Bhikshu says in the last extract at p. 73. 



288 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

Vedmta-mra treats the body of the spider as a thing 
distinct from his soul, and calls the former the material 
cause of his web, he goes along with other men* All 
that has here been said about the spider is applied, 
by the Vedantins, to their Isvara. 

The Naiyayikas, and many others, hold Isvara, 
regarded, by them, as mere spirit, to be the maker of 
the world. But these poor men, as a Vedantin would 
say, are unaware of the esoteric fact, that, in truth, 
the maker of the world is not his spirit — that is, 
his Brahma-portion, to which Isvarahood is falsely 
imputed— but his associate, which is his subtile body, 
or internal organ. 1 On this point, the Vedantins, 

i For, with the Vedantins, Isvara, no less than the soul, 
requires a sort of subtile body, or internal organ. It is called 
his causal body. Neither can do anything without one. The 
aggregate of the causal bodies of all souls, that is to say, distri- 
butive ignorances, make up Isvara’s causal body, which is 
illusion. See the Veddnta-sdra. Strange to say, the ignorance 
of a single soul renders that soul subject to misapprehension, 
and keeps it paiviscient, parupotent, etc. ; but the aggregation 
of these individual ignorances, or illusion, allows Isvara to he 
exempt from misapprehension, and communicates to him such 
attributes as omniscience and omnipotence.

condescending to avail themselves of the language of 
the, to them, parcel-blind Naiyayikas, and many others, 
falsely impute efficient causativity to Isvara, and deno- 
minate him efficient cause. But none of these short- 
sighted folk take Isvara to be the material cause of the 
world This cause some of them find in atoms ; 
others, in something else material. What, then, would 
the Vedantins offer as a material cause? Nay, as the 
very world is, to them, nothing, what need of a material 
cause at all? Nevertheless, seeing what the vulgar 
way of thinking is, one must be enunciated ; and they 
find it in ignorance, or illusion, which invents the 
world. Let the Naiyayikas take this, in place of their 
atoms, and the Sankhyas, instead of their praknti and 
so gratify their insensate craving. One may be perfectly 
sure, that, when the Vedantins speak as I have repre- 
sented, they express themselves, by way of ‘false 
imputation ’, to bring themselves down to the level of 
common minds. In truth, agreeably to their views, 
Brahma has neither creatorship, nor omniscience, nor 
omnipotence ; and, for this reason, he is not, in truth,

so on till they were all out of sight ; and that they all walked

were alike blind. Methought I borrowed courage from surprise, 
and asked him, u Who, then, is at the head to guide them ? ”

. It may be asked, whether the Vedantins really 
consider Isvara to be nothing; whether the long 
accounts of Mm, which are found in the Upanishads 
and other boobs, are all to no purpose ; and whether 
his characteristics, and those of the soul — as that he 
is omniscient, and the soul is parviscient — which are 
laid down, and the laboured discussions about these 
matters, are merely vain prattle. The Vedantins, I 
reply, declare, that equally are the world and Isvara 
simply practical, that is, imagined by ignorance, and 
false; and the long accounts just now spoken of are 
only statements of the suppositions of the uninitiated, 
propounded by way of false assumption. This they 
declare ; and there is no doubt, that in congruity with 
their doctrines, they are obliged so to declare. Still, 
they have not the assent, to it, of their innermost 
convictions. In their hearts, they have an unshaken 
confidence, that there is an Isvara, omnipotent, omnis- 
cient, omnipresent, and maker of the world. But it 
has been shown, that, strangely enough, they ascribe 
a real existence to those things even which they call 
false, to wit, the practical and the apparent. They 
look upon Kvara as practical ; and, therefore, their 
inward belief in his existence does not surprise them ; 
nor do they find any difficulty in reconciling this 
belief with their capital dogma, that nothing but the 
secondless Brahma is true. 1

The Italics are not Coleridge’s. 

1 There are two sorts of Vedantins. Some have no taste for 
worship, while others are devoted to it. The former doubtless 
believe, equally with the latter that Isvara really exists ; and 



VEDANTA AND THE SUPBEME SPIEIT 291 

these, to the best of their knowledge, worship with earnest 
faith, sincerity, and love. Of the true God, and of His attributes, 
which Holy Writ alone can teach, they are ignorant ; but their 
devotion is fervent to Rama, Krishna, and others, whom their 
books represent as God. Sarvajnatma Muni, author of the 
SankshepasdriraJca, and Madhusudana Sarasvatl, author of the 
Adwaita-siddhi — to take examples from among renowned Vedanta 
doctors — were ardent devotees of Vishnu. And there are, 
to this day, among the Vedantms, thousands of men equally 
religious. 

In passing, the error may be noted— so generally prevalent, 
nowadays, both here and abroad ; see Professor Wilson’s trans- 
lation of the Vishnu-purana, Preface, p. x — of supposing, 
that Sankara Acharya, the celebrated Vedantm, was a follower 
of Siva. Of this opinion are many of his own adherents, the 
Gosams in particular. But it appears otherwise from books 
undoubtedly of his composition, such as the Sutra-bJidshya t 
etc. ; m which Vishnu is, again and again, especially, and all 
but exclusively, magnified. Another argument may be drawn 
from the fact, that he enjoined upon his disciples to salute 
each other with names of Vishnu. Of two dandins , a younger 
and an elder, the first uses ‘ Harih and the other replies 
* Narayana On these grounds, the author is strongly disposed 
to believe, that Sankara was a Vaishnava. 

See. likewise, the notes at p. 141 and p. 199. Sankara, where 
he writes against the Pasupatas, a famous sect of &aivas, is 
silent on the subject of their devotion ; but, on coming to 
refute the peculiar tenets of the Bhagavatas, he dwells 
with unction and admiration on their religious exercises and 
service.

Organ requires an Illuminator . 

I have asserted, in the last chapter, that the Vedan- 
tins’ Brahma without qualities is not to be established, 
by any argument, as existing , he having no connexion 
with anything, either as efficient cause, or otherwise. 
To this the Vedantins may reply, that there is an 
argument for their purpose, as yet unproduced, It is, 
that the mental affection, * This is a jar or ‘ This is 
a web *, for example, stands in need of an illuminator : 
for the internal organ is unintelligent; and, therefore, 
its affections cannot cognize a jar, a web, or similar 
object. Hence, something is indispensable, by whose 
contiguity the unintelligent internal organ is to be 
illuminated: and that something is the intelligent 
spirit, or Brahma . 1 In reply, I ask, whether, in main- 
taining, that Brahma, or spirit, is intelligent and 
illuminating, it is meant, that he himself, through the 

1 Spirit, universally, is held to be one with Brahma. The 
soul ( jimtman ) of anything, or body, is a synthesis of spirit 
(liman) and internal organ. This organ abstracted, the residuum 
is, in all cases, pure Brahma. Compare the notes at pp. 4-5.

medium of the internal organ, cognizes such an object 
as a jar, or a web ; in other words, does he apprehend, 
that 4 This is a jar ‘ This is a web etc. ? And, when 
the internal organ is called the cognizer of a jar, or 
the like, is it intended to call it so only metonymically ? 
For I too talk, by way of metonymy, of the eye as 
cognizing colour, and of the ear as cognizing sound ; 
I really understanding, however, that the eye and the 
ear are not themselves cognizers, but merely media 
of cognition. What is said about Brahma is not to 
he interpreted in like manner; since, by such an 
interpretation, the Vedantin would not prove the exist- 
ence of his Brahma— ever pure, intelligent, and free, 
unchangeable, essentially existence, intelligence, and 
joy — but the existence of souls, impure, ignorant, and 
wretched. The Vedantins do not hold, that the pure 
spirit, Brahma, really cognizes objects ; that is to 
say, they do not allege, that the pure spirit cognizes 
objects in this manner — ‘This is a jar', ‘This is a 
web etc. 1 Eor, if they allowed this sort of cognition 
to him, they would have to allow to him will, 

The tenet stated in the text is thus expressed in Sankara 
Acharya’s Commentary on the Kena-upanishad : ff 

f?WT W l Bibliotheca Indica , "Vol. VIII, pp. 36-7. 

*For the internal organ, unless illuminated by the light of 
intelligence, would be incapable of willing and apprehending 
its object.’

activity, happiness, misery, and so forth ; and, as 
a consequence, he would be a doer of good and of 
evil works, and an heir of Elysium, or of Hell, and 
a partaker of threefold pain. And all this is at vari- 
ance with the Vedanta economy, which asserts, that 
spirit is Brahma, neither doer, nor experiencer, neither 
sinful, nor virtuous, etc. Since, then, you. deny, 
that the pure spirit, Brahma, really cognizes things — 
and yet they are cognized, and there is a cognizer — 
what does so cognize them? It is the internal organ, 
after all. And, whatever it is that cognizes objects, 
— as ‘ This is a jar ‘ This is a web ’ — whether you 
call it internal organ, or anything else — what necessity 
has it of an illuminator? 1 Nobody feels that it has 

i Of course we owe to the Deity our original and continued 
possession of the faculty of apprehension But, since we are 
endued with this faculty, we need, in order to our apprehend- 
ing objects, nothing further than the use of our senses and 
other appointed means. Different, however, is the notion of 
the Vedantm ; which is, that it is our internal organs, not our 
real selves, that are concerned in apprehension. The asser- 
tion, that Brahma, or spirit, is required to illuminate the internal 
organ, does not signify that we stand in need of God’s help to 
aid us to apprehend. It is not meant, that Brahma, by a volun- 
tary exercise of his power, illuminates that organ; for Brahma 
has no such power. The idea intended is, that the internal 
organ, simply by reason of its proximity to Brahma, who is 
unconscious, becomes illuminated ; just as iron moves, when 
brought near the magnet. In fact, Brahma’s influence, of 
whatever description, in the production of effects, is exerted in 
this way only.

of perception of invariable attendedness, 1 etc., but 
there is no need of any aid other than one of these ; 
nor are we conscious of any such. The Vedantins, 
however, contend, that another is indispensably de- 
siderated; the cognizer of objects, the internal organ, 
being unintelligent, and so devoid of inherent power 
of cognition. Hence, they go on to say, that power is 
derived to it by the contiguity of the intelligent spirit, 
from which contiguity it becomes quasi-intelligent ; 
just as iron moves, when brought near the loadstone. 
Spirit, or Brahma, as being that from contiguity of 
which the unintelligent becomes quasi-intelligent— 
and solely on this account — is affirmed to be intelli- 
gence and illuminating. ‘ Similarly/ the Vedantins 
would add, ‘it is declared, respecting their puruska , 
or “ soul”, by our younger brothers the Sankhyas ; and 
they are incomparably more perspicacious than you 
Christians, and the Naiyayikas, and other thinkers of 


JBtiranyagarbha, there takes place an evolution of nature, in the 
shape of the great principle . 1 

^ little further on it is explicitly stated, that the superin* 
tendency of soul is only nominal ; true superintendency belonging 
exclusively to the internal organ. 

Referring to the illumination of the internal organ, Vrjnama 
says, that the intellect becomes intelligent from the contiguity 

of soul; srgsg m ffjTtr gi i iwa., P . 109. 

In opposition to the view in question, it is assumed, and will 
soon "be proved, that it is one’s self that apprehends, and that 
the illuminator desiderated by the Vedantins is superfluous. 

1 These are the instruments of right notion recognized in the 
Nyaya. The tenets and phraseology of that school of philosophy* 
so far as they are reasonable, are adopted, throughout this volume,

the cruder sort.* To this I reply, ‘Good sirs, uot 
till I accept the truth of your concatenation of ground- 
less theories, can I grant that your illuminator is 
wanted. To be brought to your way of thinking, I 
must be convinced, first, that it is the internal organ 
which cognizes things, secondly, that a cognizer can 
be unintelligent ; thirdly, that an unintelligent cognizer 
could be made quasi-intelligent by the mere juxtaposi- 
tion of something else; and, lastly, that, becoming 
only as it were intelligent, and not positively so, 1 it 
could do that which is competent to none but one 


i The notions now under comment are equally those of the 
Vedantins and of the Sankhyas. No passage, hearing on the 
point of doctrine implied in the words to which this note is 
appended, is at this moment producible from any Vedanta

* “ It is not 


reasonable to assert, that this internal organ, which is unintelli- 
gent, like a jar, or similar thing, can be a superintendent.” 
With reference to this objection, it is said, “Because the 
internal organ is illuminated by that, viz., soul, as iron is 
heated to redness by fire .' 11 The internal organ becomes illumi- 
nated by the intelligent one, after the manner of heated iron. 
Therefore, since it becomes as it were intelligent, it can exercise 
superintendence, which a jar, or the like, cannot. Such is 
the sense.’

298 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


really intelligent. And all these notions are assump- 
tions resting upon no proof. I ask you, why you 
call the cognizer of objects unintelligent? Why not 
intelligent ? ’ ‘ What * ’ you reply, * can the internal 
organ be intelligent? No; only the spirit can.’ Again 
I ask, why you call the cognizer internal organ? 
Why not call it spirit ? To this you will say, that, 
if you did, you must yield the point, that spirit is, 
in its nature, ever pure and free. It comes, then, 
to this, that, in order to make good a favourite fancy, 
you are willing to contradict universal experience, 
and to transgress the limits of reason for the sake of 
mere dreams. These things I have dealt with in my 
examination of the Sankhya ; and so it is unnecessary 
to go into detail about them here. Still, if you will 
allow me, I will add a few words. What do you 
mean by spirit ? Is it a thing different from yourself 
and myself ? Or is it the same ? You will reply, 
‘How can we consider spirit to be anything different 
from ourselves ? For the spirit is my true proper 
essence, and yours; and therefore it is called self/ I 
rejoin, that, if you consider yourself and myself to 
be spirit, and, again, the cognizer of objects to be 
unintelligent, it follows, that you take spirit to be 
unintelligent; you and I being cognizers of objects. 
For, in canvassing the Sankhya, I have shown, that 
our consciousness, that we cognize objects, and that 
we will, etc., cannot be erroneous. Consequently, if 
the cognizer be unintelligent, you and I are so: and, 
if we are so, spirit likewise is so ; since we, as you have 
said, are spirit. The reason why you err here is, that, 
to establish a favourite fancy, you call that unintelli- 



BRAHMA AND THE VEDANTA POSITION 299 


gent which really is intelligent ; and, when you have 
made the intelligent unintelligent, you cast about for 
something else to hold for intelligent, to serve as 
illuminator of the unintelligent. Eor what are the 
characteristics of the intelligent but the qualities of 
cognizing, willing, and the like? To denote such 
qualities is the express purpose of the word intelligent. 
Whatever is competent to cognize or apprehend objects 
can require nothing more to be intelligent. Call it 
internal organ, or unintelligent, or thick darkness, or 
how you like ; the thing is not altered by altering its 
name. Your own natural reason, too, tells you, that, 
to be able to cognize is to be intelligent. Listen how 
completely you and the Sankhyas mistake on this 
point. You say, that the internal organ, being unin- 
telligent, cannot cognize of itself. Erom this it is 
evident, that you hold the cognizing of objects to be 
the office of what is intelligent. If you acknowledge 
this, and also, that the internal organ cognizes, why 
do you call- that organ unintelligent ? Is it because 
you have given it the name of internal organ ? How 
unreasonable a thing to do ! You are aware, that 
cognizing is the function of what is intelligent ; and 
you are, further, aware, that the internal organ 
cognizes. Still you gratuitously declare it to be 
unintelligent ; and then you fabricate an illuminator to 
render it intelligent. But does that illuminator make 
it positively intelligent ? No ; only quasi-intelligent. 
At first it was not intelligent; and, for that*reason, 
all was at a stand ; but now, merely from its having 
been made as it were intelligent, it becomes operative. 
Just reflect, however. If a thing, not once only, but 



•SOOTHE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

a thousand times, were made only quasi-intelligent, 
.not positively intelligent, it would still be other than 
intelligent ; and whatever is so is unintelligent ; and 
nothing that is unintelligent can do the office of the 
intelligent. But why waste time m such discussion? 
In brief, I express it as my view, that the cognizer 
of objects, namely, that which apprehends, wills, and 
energizes, is one’s self ; as yourself, or myself. Name 
this self-internal organ, or unintelligent, or whatever 
you choose , I shall not he alarmed ; nor shall I go 
in search of an illuminator for it. The faculties of 
apprehending, etc., we are convinced, were given by 
God, Creator of the world and Almighty. And, since 
He has endowed us with them, and since we know, 
intuitively, that He has appointed the senses, the 
cognition of constant attendedness, and so on, to be 
our helpers, why should we take up with a fond 
invention ? 



CHAPTER V 


Argument to show , that the Brahma of the Vedmtms t 
as being quite Void of Qualities , is reduced to 
nothing. 

I have , said, that the Vedan tin’s Brahma has no 
qualities ; in other words, he does nob possess the 
faculties of apprehending, willing, etc . 1 Now, it is 
impossible to imagine the existence of anything 
without qualities. To our understandings, whatever is 

1 See the passage from the VedmtayanbMsha, quoted at 
p, 245. Dharmaraja, who is there writing against the Naiyayi- 
kas, denies the possession of qualities, as by them understood, 
—namely, apprehension, will, activity, etc.,— to Brahma. 
A substance, says that author, is, with the Naiyayikas, the 
substrate of qualities ; and Brahma, as being mrguna , or c not 
possessed of qualities,’ is not a substance. 

Indeed, the element guna , in the word nirguri a t is generally 
to be taken as denoting what the Naiyayikas mean by quali- 
ties. See, further, the extract from the Veddnta-garibMsM, 
at p. 286. 

But, even when nirguna points to the three gunas, termed 
satka, rajas , and tamas , it is not to be supposed, that the 
twenty-four qualities of the Naiyayikas— adopted, almost all 
of them, by the Vedantins— are excepted. Among those quali- 
ties, one set, comprehending colour, taste, etc., belongs to 
external objects ; while apprehension, will, activity, etc., apper- 
tain to the internal organ ; and some, as number, dimension, 



302 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

such is nothing. The Vedantins, however, though 
maintaining that Brahma has no qualities, deny 
that he is nothing ; for, say they, on the score 
of excellence, he is surpassingly superior to all else 
that is ; he being essentially existent — or, rather, as 
they explain the word, existence — intelligence, and 
joy. My reply to this is, that the presence of what 

etc., are predicable of both. But external objects and the 
internal organ are alike evolutions from goodness, passion, and 
darkness, the components of illusion, and the material cause 
of all but spirit. Dispossess Brahma of the three gunas just 
enumerated, and he is dispossessed of consciousness and all 
similar attributes — in short, of everything conceivable* 

Dr. J. R. Ballantyne has written as follows : ‘ The Vedantists 
are sometimes charged with holding, that the phenomenal is 
the real— in other words, with material Pantheism. At the 
same time, they are charged with the wildest extravagance, of 
an opposite description, in declaring, that the Supreme is 
devoid of qualities, or, in Sanskrit, nirguria. With regard to 
the relation of the real and the phenomenal, no point appears 
to have occasioned more perplexity to the European assailants 
of Vedantism than the employment of this term nirgu^a, so 
frequently connected, in the Vedantic writings, with the name 
of the Supreme (Brahm). We find, for example, a zealous writer 
against Vedantism declaring, that, “ In any sense within the 
reach of human understanding, he ( Brahm ) is nothing . For 
the mind of man can form no notion of matter or spirit apart 
from its properties or attributes.” And the same writer calls 
upon his readers to admire the extravagant notion, that Brahm 
exists “ without intellect, without intelligence, without even 
the consciousness of his own existence ! ” Now, the reply to 
all this is, that the word nirguna is a technical term, and 
must be understood in its technical acceptation. It means 
M devoid of whatever is meant by the term guna ; ” and the 
term guna is employed ... to denote whatever is phenomenal. 
In denying that anything phenomenal .belongs constitutively 
to the Supreme Being, the Vedantin speaks very much like 



BEAHMA OB THE VEDANTINS 80 S 

are called qualities is an indispensable condition of 
existing. As for those who, differing from the mass 
of mankind, refuse to take a distinction between cor- 
porate qualities and that of which they are predicated, 
and hold them to be identical, I have no dispute 
with them. This is a most difficult matter, besides 
that I am not here called upon to contest it. Quali- 
ties — whichever of the two views just intimated is 
held concerning them — must, at all events, be main- 
tained. Otherwise, nothing can be proved to exist. 

Bishop Berkeley, and like other good Christians whom Milton’s 
epic has not educated into a semi-conscious anthropomorphism. 
... In short, the Vedantin denies, that the Supreme either 
has or requires either senses or bodily organs ; and, holding 
that organs of sense or motion are made up of what he calls 
guna — as we Europeans in general say they are made up of 
what we prefer to call matter — he asserts, that the Supreme is 
nirgupa , in very much the sense that we Europeans assert, that 
God is immaterial. We say, guardedly, “in very much the 
sense,” and not simply “in the sense”; because the term guna 
denotes, strictly, not the imperceptible quiddity “matter”, but 
what Berkeley calls the sensible , or the sum of the objects 
of sense. Theologically, the Vedantin, asserting that the Deity 
is nirguna , and the Christian, asserting that God is immaterial, 
are asserting the very same fact in terms of separate theories ; 
just as two chemists might make each the same assertion in 
regard to some individual specimen, while the one spoke of it 
as destitute of chlorine, and the other spoke of it as destitute 
of oxymuriatic a cid . G hnstiani ty contrasted, etc., pp. 43-5. 

Besides that a most sublime conception of the Deity is 
groundlessly attributed to the Vedantins, in the passage just 
extracted, two totally different ideas are there confounded; 
that of immateriality, and that of not possessing senses and 
bodily organs. It is first implied, that the Vedantin, by the 
word nirgupa, denies to his Supreme all senses and bodily 
organs ; and then it is asserted, that nirguna denotes what 
we mean by immaterial ; for that the Vedantin, like Berkeley, 



304 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


Brahma, the Vedantms allege, is essentially existence, 
intelligence, and joy; and, if his nature as intelligence 
deserved to be called so, and, similarly, his nature 
as joy, I should not say, as I do, that he is nothing. 
But, even, if his intelligence and joy were so de- 
scribed, by the Vedantins, as to deserve to be called 
such, still it would be impossible to establish his 
existence ; for he is neither the efficient nor the material 
cause of the world; and hence he is out of relation 
with the world , and how, then, can we arrive, by 
inference, at a conviction of his existence ? I will 

does not believe in the ‘ imperceptible quiddity, matter \ Now, 
supposing this assertion, which is not true, to be true, still 
the subtle tenet of repudiating matter can in nowise be sug- 
gested by the term nirguna, if used of Brahma, to express, 
for one thing— as it has been inferred to do— that he is 
destitute of senses and bodily organs. The word gw&a is 
sometimes applied indeed to the senses and bodily organs, but 
never to signify ‘the sensible’, or quality involved in the 
ordinary mrguna. One of its several meanings is that of 
appliance, or instrument ; and it is in this acceptation that 
it denotes the senses and bodily organs. See Vijnana Bhikshu’s 
explanation of guna , in the last extract from the Smkhya- 
pravachana^'bMshya, given at p. 60. The following words, 
from another work of the same author, plainly indicate, 
that the term gun,a is applied to the organs of sense, etc., 

solely to mark them as instruments :

show, however, that the hypothetical Brahma of the 
Yedautins, as they describe him, comes out to be a 
nonentity. They declare, that he is constitutively 
cognition, and yet cognizes nothing ; for, according to 
the Yedantia, the cognizing anything, or cognition re- 
lative to an object, is an affection of the internal 
organ ; 1 and Brahma’s constitutive cognition is not 
such. 2 An object abstracted, cognition is impractica- 
ble: for how can there be cognition where there is

for its object ’ 

The emphasis must not be laid on the word * external \ in 
this passage , for things external and internal— as will shortly 
be proved — are objects of the same species of cognition. It 
happens to be the cognition of the external that is mentioned

call the walls around us, and the roof overhead, forms 
of cognition? How have the Vedantins, by changing 
names, forgotten the genuine nature of things 1 By- 
giving the titles of internal organ, unintelligent, etc., 
to that which is really intelligent, or the cognizer 
of objects, they have brought themselves to regard 
it as unintelligent. On the other hand, by applying 
to that which is unintelligent, and cognizes nothing, 
namely, their 4 spirit the epithets of essential cogni- 
tion, self-illuminated, etc., they have passed to look 
upon it as intelligent. Can a pebble be transformed 
into a diamond by one’s calling it so? 

It can never be said of the pandits, whatever subject 
they may be handling, that they leave their views

Since all these are false, Brahma, being postulated as true,

essence. 

See, also, the passage from the Yoga-vasishtha , at p. 245, in 
which that cognition which is of the essence of spirit is plainly 
taken to have no relation to objects, whether external or internal.

are included the cognition of Isvara, and that of the

as being an affection of the internal organ. 1 

With us, the eyes and other senses, to which the

Not so, however, with the Vedantins, is their internal 
organ; it is the apprehender of objects, and the sole 
apprehender thereof; 2 though, from their perplexed 
style of expression, they seem to allot the function of

cognition has place. This cognition is an exception, as to its 
origin. Still, it is an affection, one evolved from ignorance; 
and it is not of the essence of spirit. During dreamless sleep, 
the internal organ, the ordinary producer of cognition, is thought 
to be dissolved. See the Vedantarsara , p. 6. 

It is a momentous error to suppose, as has recently been done, 
that the cognition -which the Naiyayikas count for one of their 
four and twenty qualities is claimed, by the Vedantins, under 
the title of chit, as constitutive of Brahma. That cognition is, 
indeed, acknowledged by the Vedantins, but, being relative to 
objects, is an affection of the internal organ. The Naiyayikas, on 
the other hand, consider it to he a property of the soul ; and, 
ou this very account, they are lightly reputed by the Vedantins 
and Sankhyas. See The Bible for the Pundits , Introduction, 
pp, 45-64, where the error referred to is committed. 

9 The Vedantin’s internal organ has erroneously been called 
a medium of cognition, in a passage soon to be cited from 
Chnsticmity contrasted, etc.

appropriated to the internal organ ;’ 1 etc Lest 
my readers should here be in doubt , 2 I will first 
evince, that the cognition which we call so, the cog- 
nizing of objects, is, in the Vedanta, nothing but an 
affection of the internal organ ; whence it follows, that 
only the internal organ is a cognizer. And then I 
intend to show what we are to understand by the 
Vedantins’ applying the designations of right notion 
and subject of right notion to intelligence, that is to 
say, Brahma. 

We find an object of perception defined as ‘ non- 
difference from the subject of right notion .’ 3 Intelli- 
gence appropriated to the internal organ is meant by 
the expression ‘subject of right notion;’ and it is 
said, that ‘ Mon-difference from the subject of right 
notion is not here denotative of oneness with it, but 
is the non-possession of an existence distinct from 
that of the subject of right notion / 4 I explain. In 
the view of the Vedantins, as silver is imagined in 
nacre, so the world is imagined in Brahma; and, as

the existence of the silver is one with that of the 
nacre, so is the existence of the world one with that 
of Brahma. The drift of this is, that the silver and 
the world, as such, are nothing, but, as nacre and as 
Brahma, severally, have true existence. It is further 
stated, that, on one’s perceiving a jar, the jar be- 
comes, in the following manner, non-different from 
the subject of right notion. When the jar is seen, 
an effluence from the internal organ passes through 
the eye to it, and takes its form. This effluence of 
the internal organ is called an affection. When, 
therefore, the internal organ thus reaches the jar, at 
that place intelligence appropriated to the internal 
organ, namely the subject of right notion, andthejar- 
appropriated intelligence, in which the jar is imagined, 
become one; just as, if one brings a jar into the 
house, the jar-appropriated ether and the house-appro- 
priated ether become one. In the way lately stated, the 
existence of the jar is not different from that of the 
jar-appropriated intelligence, one with the subject of 
right notion; and hence the jar becomes non-different 
from that subject. Thus, the definition of object of 
perception, cited just above, applies to a jar seen with 
the eye. In reply to an objection suggested to that 
definition, it is said, that the subject of right notion 
must be understood to be ‘ associated with the affection 
which has taken the form of the given object of 
perception’ 1 To this, again, it is excepted, that, with 
such a qualification, the definition is inapplicable to

an affection. As a jar is an object of perception, so is 
an affection; and, therefore, the definition of object 
of perception ought to cover affection also. The objec- 
tion just mentioned is expressed thus : ‘ In this case, 
there is the exclusion of affection ; for, inasmuch 
as, from fear of an infinite regress, a second affection 
cognizing the primary affection cannot be acknow- 
ledged, the definition aforesaid, giving to the subject 
of right notion the characteristic of associatedness 
with the affection that has taken the form of it, 
that is, of its object, is not mclusive'ot that affection 
here considered as the object of 'perception, which ought 
to be comprehended by the definition 1 To this it is 
rejoined: ‘Though, from fear of an infinite regress, 
we do not acknowledge , that the affection is cognized 
by a second affection, still, since it is acknowledged, 
that it is self-cognized, the definition , “to possess an 
existence non-different from that of intelligence, the 
subject of right notion, associated with affection cogniz- 
ing it, viz . the object of perception is applicable to it, 
namely to the affection which is the object of perception *

‘ affection ’ is always a matter of consciousness. If, 
however, such an affection be not cognition itself, 
but, like the eye, or the ear, a medium of cognition, 
how can it be an object of immediate consciousness ? 
Is any one conscious of an immediate consciousness 
of such a medium of cognition ? Do the Naiyayikas, 
who call the mind an internal organ only, in other 
words, simply a medium of cognition, like the eye, 
etc., ever declare, that it becomes an object of immediate 
consciousness? 1 Of our cognition of a jar, or the 
like, we are, indeed, conscious , and so it is certain, 
that such an affection of the internal organ as has 
here been dwelt on is nothing but what We call cog- 
nition. Moreover, as I made out, when discussing 
•the Sankhya, our consciousness ot the qualities of 
our souls, cognition, etc., is not distinct from those 
qualities; a notion which turns out to have the con- 
currence of the Vedantins: since, as we have seen, 
they do not hold, that an affection is cognized by a 
secondary affection, that is to say, in a distinct act 

1 If the Vedantins held the internal organ to ho what its 
name promises, their tenet, that its affections are objects of 
consciousness, would he exposed to the following stricture, which 
is put into the mouth of an objector, and is answered by the 
simple denial, that the so-called internal organ is an organ ;

of consciousness, but that it is self- cognized. In 

short, with them, the consciousness of cognition is not 
distinct from cognition itself. 

That the Yedantins hold such an affection to be 
cognition, and that it is the internal organ which 
cognizes, appears, further, from this passage : ‘ Affee- 
tional cognition is a property of the mmd. Of this 
the scripture, “ Desire, resolve, dubiety, trust, distrust, 
fixedness, unfixedness, shamefastness, understanding, 
fear — all these are of mind alone,” is the proof. For 
cognition in the form of affection is intended by “un- 
derstanding.” Desire and the rest, as well, are, there- 
fore, proved to be mental properties ’ 1 To this it is 
objected ; ‘ If desire and the rest be properties of the 
internal organ, how can the consciousness, “I desire”, 
“ I fear ”, “I cognize ”, or the like, which cognizes 
them as properties of the soul, be accounted for 9 * 2 
The answer given is : ‘ As, though a heated iron ball 
does not possess the power of scorching, still, by our 
imagining the identity with it of fire, the possessor

of that power, it is supposed, that the iron ball 
scorches; so, by imagining the identity of the soul , 
i,e . of one’s self, with the internal organ, which 
evolves in the shape of happiness, etc., one supposes, 
“I am happy”, “I am miserable”, etc.’ 1 Now, we 
are certain, that ‘ I cognize ’ denotes nothing but what 
we all call cognition; and what is thus denoted, it is 
here laid down, is a property of the internal organ, 
and an affection of the same. 

Not only cognitions of external things, but also* 
cognitions with regard to one’s self, or acts of con- 
seiousness, the Vedantins consider to be affections of 
the internal organ. For of the latter species are the 
cognitions, ‘I cognize,’ ‘I desire,’ etc.; since it is 
only with the aid of some quality, as cognition, desire, 
or suchlike, that we become conscious of our souls. 
We can never cognize the simple substance of the 
soul; as the Naiyayikas, too, acknowledge. 2 And, 
though the Vedantin, like the Sankhya, calls cognition, 
desire, etc., immediate objects of the witness himself, 
by which the soul is intended ; still neither of them 
believes those qualities to be cognized by the soul

unaccompanied by an affection of the internal organ. 1 
In other words, those qualities are cognized by the 
internal organ itself; 2 and the calling them immediate 
objects of the witness is found, on scrutiny, to be 
deceptive. 

Again, according to the Vedantins, the immediate 
cognition of the soul, which is said to result from 
listening to the Vedanta, and from consideration and 
meditation on it — namely, the conviction, that one is

bhdshd, p. 7. c For, to be cognizable by the witness alone is 
not to become an object of the witness independently of an 
affection of the internal organ , but it is to be an object of the 
witness apart from the aid of an organ of sense, inference, or 
such other instrument of right notion.’

p. 7. 4 Thus, then, since the definition of the object of perception, 
as containing the words, “associated with affection”, etc., is 
applicable to the internal organ, its properties, etc., which are 
cognizable by the witness alone, there is no deficiency.’ 

Hence, the properties of the internal organ, though said to 
be cognizable by the witness alone, are, in truth, cognized by 
an affection of that organ. Otherwise, the definition just given 
would be inapplicable to those properties. 

For 4 associated with the affection,’ etc., see the first note 
at p. 813. 

As the Vedantins allege, of the properties of the internal 
organ, that they are cognizable by the witness alone, so do they 
allege respecting apparent objects also. Yet, for the cognition of 
these, too, they contend, that an affection of the internal organ 
is indispensable. See the Vedanta-paribMsM, pp. 7 and 11. 



316 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

void of cognition, will, and all other qualities, and of 
all mutation, and is the pure Brahma — is itself an 
affection of the internal organ; 1 which affection is to 
be got rid of before emancipation is attainable. 2 

It must now be manifest, that the Yedantins’ affec- 
tion of the internal organ, which has thus been de- 
scribed, is what we mean by cognition, or the appre- 
hension of things, be they external, or internal, that is, 
of the soul and its qualities. And all the divisions 
which those philosophers make of .this cognition, or 
cognition relative to objects, are affections, as afore- 
said, Consequently, the cognition which is given out 
as a constituent of Brahma, is irrelative to objects; 
that is to say, it is not cognition of anything, whether 
himself or aught else. 

As we have seen, the Yedantins enunciate, that 
perceptive right notion is intelligence itself, and that 
the subject of right notion is intelligence appropriated 
to the internal organ. Erom this it seems as if, with 
them, intelligence itself were both cognition and cog- 
nizer, and as if the internal organ, its affections, etc., 
were only media of cognition. Those declarations are 
to be understood as follows. The term cognition, as 
they apply it to Brahma, means, they say, not cog- 
nizing or apprehending, but illuminating, and it is the 
internal organ that is illuminated, or made capable of 
cognizing. Thus, in order, that their unintelligent 
Brahma should be made out constitutively cognition, 
they have altered the sense of the word cognition to 
such an extent, that, in their employment, it signifies, 

* l See the Vedanta-sara , p. 21. 2 See the Vedanta-sara , p, 22. 



BBAHMA OF THE VEDANTINS 


817 


primarily, to illuminate, and, only, metonymically to 
apprehend objects* That affection of the internal organ 
which — supposing such a thing to exist — ought to be 
veritable cognition, is, therefore, according to them, 
but metonymic cognition . 1 By asserting, then, that 
perceptive right notion is intelligence itself, they 
mean, that intelligence illuminates the affection. When 
an affection proceeds from the internal organ, and 
portends itself to an object, a reflexion of intelligence 
falls on that affection ; and so that affection is enabled 
to cognize the object. But for illumination from 
intelligence, it could cognize nothing; for it is pro- 
nounced, that ‘ There, namely , as for an affection and 
the reflexion of Brahma therein, ignorance, veiling the 
object of cognition, a jar, for instance , is destroyed by 
the affection whuh takes the form of that object ; and, 
by the reflection, the jar is made to appear .’ 3 By 
this it is not to be understood, that the jar is made 
to appear to the reflexion of intelligence, that is to 
say, that the reflexion cognizes the jar; but, that the 
jar is made to appear to the affection, in other words, 
that the affection is rendered capable of cognizing the 
jar. In proof, that such is the meaning of the Vedan- 
tins, I cite this single passage, from among innumer- 
able passages that might be produced : * For the 

1 I Vedanta- 

parilhasM, p. 2. ‘An affection of the internal organ , since it 
is that to which cognition, i.e. Brahma, is appropriated, is 
itself metonymically denominated cognition.’

internal organ, if it were not illuminated by the light 
of intelligence, would be incapable of willing and 
apprehending its object,’ 1 It is evident, from this, 
that it. is the very internal organ, illuminated by 
intelligence, that cognizes things. 

But, when they give to intelligence appropriated to 
the internal organ the name of subject of right notion } 
we are to understand, that the character which they 
ascribe to intelligence associated with the internal 
organ, really belongs to that organ. They have a 
maxim — which all the other Systems subscribe to — • 
that ‘ An affirmation, or a negation, when predicated 
of anything together with its associate, if debarred 
from the object substantive, is to be referred to the 
object adjective.’ 2 In their opinion, the quality, of 
being a cognizer cannot be assigned to the soul, and, 
consequently is debarred from it. Eor our cognition 
of objects is non-eternal ; and, therefore, if it were 
regarded as constitutive of the soul, the soul would, to 
their thinking, be made out non-eternal and change- 
able. 3 And, again, if they held that cognition to

■belong to the soul, they must hold, that will, activity, 
happiness, misery, etc., also belong to it , and the 
result would be, that the soul is indeed a doer of good 
and evil, and an experience! of three-fold misery : an 
issue most offensive to them ; inasmuch as they would 
establish, that the soul is Brahma, eternally pure and 
free. Once more, their granting the soul to be a 
cognizes would involve the necessity of recognizing 
the relation of quality and subject as having place 
between it and its cognition: and even this much of 
an approach to duality they find unendurable. 1 On 
such grounds as these, the Vedantins would ascribe 

organs of sense is an affection of the internal organ ; for 
constitutive cognition is beginningless. 5 

But it must not be thought, that sensation only is an 
affection of the internal organ; for every kind of cognition of 
objects is so. 

' 1 No more are the Vedantins than the Naiyayikas, or mankind 
at large, able to conceive, that either cognition, or any other 
quality, can subsist without a substrate. Foi that cognition, 
with them, which alone deserves to he thus designated, 
namely, an affection of the internal oigan, has a substrate m 
that organ. See the first extract from p. 3 of the Vedanta- 
paribhashd , at p. 313. That cognition which is thought to 
be constitutive of Brahma is cognition only nominally, not pro- 
perly, and hence is not a quality. It does not, therefore, stand 
in need of any substrate. 

The Vedantins, and the Sankhyas also, do not discriminate 
so sharply as the Naiyayikas between substance and quality. The 
latter hold them to differ m their very essence; while the 
former consider them to be co-essential. For, in the account 
of these, all things hut spirit are evolutions from one root: 
illusion with the Vedantms, and nature with the Sankhyas. 
Still, they take thus much of distinction between substance 
and quality, as to regard them as being, severally, substrate 
and property. 



320 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

cognition and all other qualities to the internal organ, 
and keep the soul entirely a stranger thereto. And 
the soul, with them, is itself Brahma. 1 

I have seen it stated, that only the soul requires an 
internal organ; since, except for its aid, the soul 
cannot apprehend: but, as for Brahma, he can ap- 
prehend all things without its aid. And so it has 
been attempted to prove, that Brahma’s cognition is 
real cognition. 2 All this is quite opposed to the 
Vedanta. I have shown, that it is wrong to regard 
the internal organ, in that system, as a medium of 
the soul’s cognition ; since, on examination, it is found 
to be no such medium, but itself the cognizer. That 
which lies beyond this organ is the soul, which never 
cognizes: and soul is Brahma. Of the soul there^are 
two portions, Brahma and the internal organ. Hence, 
when the second is parted off, what remains is 

1 Spirit, one naturally supposes, is something intelligent. 
But the Vedantins and the Sankhyas are necessitated, by their 
theories, to assign all the characteristics of what is intelligent 
to their internal organ. Hence, spirit is left, to them, unintelli- 
gent. Nevertheless, their inward consciousness shames them 
from professing, in terms, that it is so. That they are thus 
shamed is the real reason why they give to spirit the epithet 
of jnmcLi chit, bodka , etc. At the same time, they deprive 
these epithets, as thus employed, of their sole proper import. 

2 ‘ Reverting to the charge of extravagance m the notion, 
that Brahm exists without intellect, without intelligence, with- 
out even the consciousness of his own existence,” it may be well 
to repeat here what the Vedantin means by the terms thus 
rendered. By intellect (or mind) he means an internal organ 
which, in concert with the senses, brings the human soul into 
cognitive relation with the external. This, of course, he denies 
to Brahm , who, as Berkeley says of God, “ perceives nothing 
by sense as we do,” Christianity contrasted , etc,, p, 47- 



BRAHMA OE THE VED&NTINS

Brahma. This residue the Vedantins declare to be 
essentially existence, intelligence, and joy; and, as has 
been made evident, it is destitute of all faculty of 
knowledge and apprehension. 

The opinion about Brahma, just now arraigned, is 
based on the error of supposing, that by him is meant 
Isvara ; the difference between the two, which the 
Vedantins inculcate, being overlooked . 1 But Isvara, 
no less than the soul, has, they declare, in order 
to cognize, etc., need of an internal organ. Isvara, 
they say, is Brahma associated with illusion; and 
they hold Isvara to be omniscient, omnipotent, etc. 
Yet the attributes of omniscience, omnipotence, etc.,, 
belong to Isvara’s causal body, which is illusion , 2 and 
not*to the Brahma-portion of him. By consequence, 
all Isvara’s attributes, nay, he himself, are false, and 
imagined by ignorance. 

Every doubt of the reader, as to the nature of 
Brahma's cognition, must, by this time, have been 
dispelled. Alike parviscience and omniscience, alike 
knowledge of himself and knowledge of what is not 
himself, are maintained, by the Vedantins, to be un- 
worthy of Brahma. What sort of cognition, therefore, 
can that be which they consider as one of his con- 
stituents 9 

1 That this difference is overlooked in Christianity con- 
trasted , etc., is evident from three things. First, the word 
Brahma is everywhere translated thereby 4 God.’ Secondly, 
the attributes of omnipotence, omniscience, etc., are attributed 
to Brahma. Thirdly, no intimation even is put forth of any 
distinction, in the opinion of the Vedantins, between Brahma 
and Isvara.

CHAPTER VI 


Strictures on the Posttion of the Vedantins , that the 
world is False; and a Reply to those who suppose, 
that the Vedantins ’ Vieios respecting External 
Things accord w^th those of Berkeley . 

It is maintained, by the Vedantins, that * The world 
is false * ; in other words, that it owes its origin to 
ignorance: the truth being, it is alleged, that it never 
has existed, and does not exist, and never will exist. 
To this effect the Siva-gUa declares: ‘Just as the 
terrible snake that is imagined m the rope neither 
had origin, nor is, nor is to be destroyed; so the 
world, which has assumed an appearance simply by 
force of thy illusion, exists in thee, Nilakantba.’ 1 
I demand of the Vedantins, How is it that you 
assert falseness of the world, which is certified to us,

'fey the senses, etc., to be true ? Since you thus despise 
those proofs, what credit can be attached to anything 
that you advance? Proceeding in this way, you un- 
settle the foundations of everything, whether as re- 
gards this world, or as regards the next. And, on 
your own grounds, how can you refute the doctrines 
•of others, or establish your own? 

Perhaps, you will urge, that, since the senses, etc., 
•often deceive us, they are totally unreliable. For 
instance, we are sure, that we see chariots, elephants, 
and other things, in our dreams; and yet they are 
proved to be false. I reply, that, if a seeming proof 
is made out, by a real proof, to be faulty, we reject 
it. But how can we contemn a proof which cannot 
be # shown to be faulty? As for the things that we 
;see in dreams, we call them false, because, on awaking, 
we find them to be so; and their falsity, as being 
matter of every-day experience, is indubitable. But 
who has ever found the external objects of nature to 
be false ? Has not every man of all generations borne 
•evidence to their truth? 

If you say, that, to a man in dreamless sleep, the 
world disappears, and that his experience goes to 
disprove the truth of the world, I demur to the 
conclusion; since, a man’s cognition being then sus- 
pended, he cannot be brought forward as witness for 
anything that then had place It is the belief of the 
Yedantins, that, even in dreamless sleep, there subsists 
a sort of cognition. 1 Let this be granted ; still, external 
things are not proved, thereby, to be false. To form 


i See note at p. 308. 



324 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


any judgement whatever about them is not competent 
to his cognition ; and therefore, it cannot conclude 
their falsity. In like manner, a blind man is able to 
appreciate sound, touch, etc., but • not colours ; and 
so he can be no witness of their truth, or of their 
falseness. 

I would also remind the reader of the argument I 
employed, when discussing the Sankhya, to prove the 
existence of God. When we inspect the structure of 
the world, we become convinced, that it was planned, 
consciously, by some one, for a multiplicity of ends ; 
and this consideration confutes your view, that the 
world is simply apparent, 1 and that eternal ignorance 
is the ground of its semblance. 

Berkeley maintains, that objects of sense are only 
ideas, they having no existence in themselves and 
apart from perception. This is immaterialism. But 
he does not hold, that the things which we see, touch, 
etc., are false: his meaning is, that they are forms of 
perception The perception of them constitutes, in 
his view, their existence ; whereas, the common opinion 
is, that they exist independently of perception. He 
does not say, however, they are imaginations of 
! 

l It is true, that the Yedantins hold the world to he 
constructed by an intelligent designer, Isvara ; and such con- 
struction they believe, from the standing point of practical 
existence, to have actually taken place. This view of theirs 
arises however, from their taking practical things to be real, 
which things, at the same time, they would prove to he 
nothing — only ignorance-imagined: a combination of incompa- 
tible notions is ignored m the text, it being aimed at the 
latter of those notions ; that which, with the Yedantins, is by 
much the more essential. 



THE VEDANTINS AND BEBKELEY 325 


eternal ignorance , and, the Vedanta doctrine, that, 
on the removal of ignorance, and attainment of right 
apprehension, the whole world ‘disappears, like a 
dream on awaking, he knows nothing of whatsoever. 
Whether his theory be tenable, or untenable, is a 
matter I am not here concerned with. My present 
purpose is, to show, that the doctrine of the Vedanta 
concerning the external world, besides being in conflict 
with the common opinion, has not so much as a re- 
semblance to that of Berkeley. Yet, a resemblance 
here has been asserted. It has been assorted, that 
the Vedantins, when they call sensible objects practical, 
do not mean, that they are false, but only that they 
do not exist apart from perception; and that the 
world is said, in the Vedanta, to be false, simply from 
ambiguousness of phraseology. 1 

But, for my part, 1 understand the Vedanta other- 
wise. First,* according to Berkeley, objects of sense 
are forms of perception; but, according to the Vedan- 
tins, objects of sense are distinct from peiception, and 
independent of it. The Vedantins, I have already 
shown, consider, that the cognition which apprehends 
external things is an affection of the internal organ, 
let that cognition be perception, or inference, etc. ; 
and that the objects which that affection cognizes are 
distinct from the affection itself, and have existence 
independent of it. 2 An affection is an evolution from

the internal organ; but the objects which it cognizes 
are evolutions from ignorance, or illusion. And it 
must not be forgotten, that ignorance is not the re- 
verse of right apprehension, mistake ; for, in that case, 
it would itself be an 'affection of the internal organ ; 
since both right apprehension and wrong apprehension

of a reservoir, issuing through apertures, enters the fields- 
rillwise, and becomes, like them, quadrangular, or of other 
shapes; so the passional internal organ, through the medium 
of the eye, or the like, extends itself to the place occupied by 
a jar, or other object, and is evolved in the form thereof. This 
same evolution is called an affection. But, in the case of 
inferential cognition, etc., there is no extension, on the part of 
the internal organ, to the locality of the fire, etc., because 
these are not brought into connexion with the eye, etc. So, 
then, in the case of such a perception as “ This is a jar,” since 
the jar and the affection of like conformation thereto take up 
one and the same space, externally to the body , the intelligence 
appropriated to both, viz. the jar and the affection , is but one : 
for, although the affection of the internal organ, and the 
object, as the jar, are two dividers of intelligence , or Brahma ; 
stiff, since, in the present instance , they take up one and the- 



THE VEDANTINS AND BERKELEY , 327 

are such affections. In the Vedanta, ignorance, like 
the ‘nature' of the Sankhya, is an unintelligent sub- 
stance. As the Sankhyas take the visible" 'world to 
be an evolution from nature, so do the Vedantins 
regard it as being an evolution from ignorance. 1 Of 

same space, they do not operate to divide the affection-appro- 
priated intelligence from the gar-appropriated intelligence . On 
this very account, the ether appropriated to a jar within the 
house does not differ from the ether of the house itself .’ 

The purpose of all this is to show, that, perception, affection- 
appropriated Brahma and object-appropriated Brahma are 
unified , for to show this is necessary, in the work cited, to 
explain its definition of perception. 

We have seen it stated, that, m perception, the affection of the 
internal organ extends itself to the spot already occupied by 
the object perceived. In inferential or other cognition than 
perception, there is, however, no such extension of the affec- 
tion ; and it is, further, laid down, that the object and the 
affection are two several dividers of intelligence, or Brahma. 
In inferential cognition, etc., they serve as such ; but not so in 
perception. From this it is clear, that an object is distinct 
from, and independent of, the affection, that is to say, the 
cognition, which apprehends it. 

Had not an attempt been made to father Berkeleianism upon 
the Vedantins, it would have been most supererogatory to refer to 
any proof of tbe position, that the Vedantins take objects to exist 
irrespectively of tbeir being perceived. From tbe standing point 
of true existence, not only objects, but the perception of them, 
are nothing ; but, from that standing point whence perception 
is real, objects likewise are held to be so, and not to be 
dependent on perception. 

Much too ready are learned foreigners to identify Indian 
notions with those of European speculators, ancient and 
modern. What are so hastily taken to be correspondences 
will generally turn out, on further examination, to be mere 
fancied resemblances. 

l Not simply practical things, but, strangely enough, apparent 
things also, are maintained, by tbe Vedantins, to exist separately 



328 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


the confusion which besets this point I shall treat 
in the seventh and ninth chapters. 

This, therefore, is certain, that the Vedantins con- 
cur with the generality of mankind as concerns the 
existence of external things apart from perception. 
Very little indeed have they of the philosophic pro- 
fundity of a Berkeley. 

Secondly, though the Vedantins agree with the bulk 
•of men, as just stated, they take a line of their own, 
in saying, that objects of sense are imaginations of 
ignorance, or false. And herein they differ from 
Berkeley, too, who does not call such objects false, 
•but forms of perception, and acknowledges them to 
be true, in the current sense of the term. The 
Vedantins compare the objects of the senses ta a 
snake surmised in a rope, or to silver fancied in nacre, 
and hold them to be altogether false, and so our 
cognition of them to be erroneous. Hence, several 
of the great Vedantin doctors consider the world to 
be, in their technical language, apparent; and they 
•add, that the regarding the world as belonging to 
another category than that of nacrine silver, i.e. the 
regarding it as practical, is prompted by a desire to 
assist the uninitiate. 

Thirdly, in the Vedanta system, not only are objects 

from, and independently of, the apprehension of them. See a 
passage in the seventh page of the Vedanta-paribh&sha , beginning 

^ I and the extract from the 

same work, cited at p. 234. To one aware, that the Vedantins 
hold notions, such as that referred to, there must seem to he 
exceedingly slight grounds for comparing them as to subtlety, 
with Berkeley, 



THE VEDANTINS AND BERKELEY 329 


•of cognition imaginations of ignorance, and false, 
but cognition itself is so : for cognition is an affection 
■of the internal organ; and, not being Brahma, it is 
to be classed with imaginations of ignorance, and 
falsities ; just like a jar, or any other external 
thing. Objects and the cognizing them are, thus, held 
to be alike false. 1 How vast a gulf does this single 
point of difference place between the Vedanta and 
Berkeleianism ! 

Eourthly, in the theory of Beikeley, the world, 
birth, death, Heaven, Hell, and the happiness and 
misery arising therefrom, though forms of perception, 
are true, and not of such a nature, that they vanish 
away on the supervening of right apprehension. On 
the^ other hand, agreeably to the Vedantins, when a 
man becomes convinced, that the objects which we 
cognize through our senses and other media of know- 
ledge, are false, that is that they never existed, and do 
not now exist, and never will exist, and that Brahma

does that affection veritably take cognizance of such an external 
object ; because, in truth it, the affection , does not itself exist, 
and because such an object is imaginary. By consequence, an 
affection's cognizing such an object is apparent. This is the 
sense.’

alone, essentially existence, intellect, joy, is true, and 
that he is that man’s self, all those objects dissolve 
into nothingness; as happens with nacrine silver, on 
our discerning nacre, mistaken for silver, to be nacre. 
Thus, it is said, ‘Like nacrine silver, the world ap- 
pears true, so long as Brahma, the substrate of all, 
without a second, remains unknown/ 1 When, there- 
fore, the Vedantins declare, that this world, and the 
next, and ail things thereto pertaining, are falsitiable 
by right apprehension, let. no one explain their language 
to import, that, when a man acquires such apprehen- 
sion, this world, and the next, etc., through God’s 
grace, or from some other cause, become as nothing 
to him. It is not, the Vedantins themselves teach, 
that they become as nothing, but strictly nothing; 
they being recognized as illusive , and they become 
nothing in consequence of the acquisition of right 
apprehension, and from no other cause whatever. It 
is laid down, that- there are two sorts of riddance 
of the products of ignorance. One, called cessation, 
takes place when, by the uprise of a new and op- 
ponent affection of the internal organ, or by getting 
quit of defects, an erroneous affection is destroyed,, 
and, of course, its object. It is illustrated by the 
shattering a jar with a pestle. The other, known 
as falsification, is when the right perception of the

is twofold ■ the one, where the material cause, viz. ignorance 
is included ; the other, where the material cause remains 
untouched. The first is denominated falsification; the second, 
cessation. Of the former the cause is, the intuition of the true 
nature of the substrate over which a false thing is imagined ; 
since, but for this intuition , nescience, or ignorance, the material 
cause, cannot be done away. Of the latter the cause is, the 
origination of an antagonistic affection or else the abolition of 
defects. Hence, in the present instance, by reason of the non- 
existence of the intuition of Brahma, the substrate of all imagi- 
nary objects, however the world of dreams is not falsified, what 
incongruity is .there m supposing, that, as a Jar, or the like, is

another and antagonistic conception, or by the discontinuance 
of sleep, or other defect, originative thereof, i.e. of dreaming, 
the chariot, or other thing dreamt of, ceases?’ 

It Is worth observing, that the Ved anting are not so accurate 
in the employment of their peculiar phraseology, as not fre- 
quently to use nivfitti, f cessation,’ where they ought, agreeably 
to their own definitions, to use badha, ‘falsification.’ Thus, 
in the extract from the Veddnta-paribhasM, p, 32, given at

Thus it occurs in the case of nacre, so often men* 
fcioned; 1 and equally false with nacrine silver become, 
according to the Vedanta, the whole world, and the 
ignorance which originates it, as soon as one has 
mastered the knowledge of Brahma.

1 Two views, entertained touching the cause of things like 
nacrine silver, are referred to m the passage quoted below. It 
is according to the first only, that those things are held to be 
falsified by right apprehension of what is mistaken for them. 
According to the second view, such things, owing to the right 

apprehension m question, simply cease to exist. 'OTcf xj

nacre-appropriated intelligence, there results, from the cognition, 
“This is nacre, ** falsification of silver, and of the ignorance 
pertaining to that .nacre. But on the opinion, that nacrine 
silver is a product of radical nescience, i.e. of the ignorance 
which resides m and obsemes pure Brahma , and is the cause of

such silver , is removable solely by intuition of Brahma, not by 
cognition of the true nature of nacre, there ensues , as the fruit 
of right apprehension of nacre, nothing more than the cessation 
of silver; in the same way as a jar is destroyed by the blow 
of a pestle.’ 



CHAPTER VII 


The Soul, being subject to Ignorance, cannot, as the 
Vedantins hold, be One with the Supreme Spirit ; 
a Description of Ignorance ; and an Argument to 
show, that the Denial of the Soul’s Identity with 
Brahma is not set aside by taking the Epithet of 
False, as applied to Ignorance, in the Acceptation 
of Perishable. 

It is a maxim of the Vedanta, that ‘The soul is 
Brahma itself, and nothing other.’ How, I would 
ask the Vedantins, can this be? For they assert, 
that, on the one hand, soul errs by reason of ignorance ; 
and that, on the other hand, Brahma is, in essence, 
ever pure, intelligent, and free, and can never for a 
moment be otherwise. Still 'they maintain, that the 
soul is Brahma; and, with intent to reconcile their 
contradiction, they resort to the most elaborate mysti- 
fication. Some among them say, that the reflexion of 
Brahma in the internal organ is soul , 1 and that to 
the soul appertains all error; wherefore error has no 
connexion with Brahma. 

i See the passage from the Ved&nta-paribh&sha, p. 41, cited 
at p. 257. 



334 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

Such as say thus, the reflexionists, 1 * find no difficulty 
in maintaining, that the soul — a reflexion, with them — 
is liable to error, and that Brahma is exempt there- 
from. Other Yedantins, however— those who hold 
the soul to be Brahma as appropriated to the internal 
organ 2 — the appropriationists, 3 4 perceive, that, if the 
soul be simply as they allege, its defects must* be 
participated by Brahma. In expatiating on this point, 
they disclose one of their mysteries. Though, in 
their view, the soul is Brahma as appropriated to 
the internal organ, and though it is said to err; yet, 
in truth, all its qualities, as cognition, will, etc,, and 
error, likewise, belong not to its Brahma-portion, but 
to its associate, the internal organ ; in accordance 
with the maxim, ‘An affirmation, or a negation/ etc. 1 

But the reader should be reminded, that the language 
of the reflexionists, no less than that of the appro- 
priationists, is deceptive here. For, since, as has 
been shown, it is neither the reflexion of Brahma in 
the internal organ, nor Brahma as appropriated to 
that organ, to which the qualities of the soul tnily 
appertain, but the internal organ, it is this that the 
Yedantins ought to consider to be soul. 

None of those philosophers entertain the opinion, 
that the internal organ is the soul. When pressed 
with the question, how the soul, which is obnoxious 
to error, can be Brahma, they distinctly declare, that 

l In Sanskrit, pratibimba-vddin,

at p. 257. 

3 In Sanskrit, avachehhinna-vSdins. 

4 This maxim is given in full at p, 818. 



THE SOUL AND THE SUPBEME SPIBIT 335 


error affects the internal organ, not him. I tell the 
Vedantins, therefore, that, if that in which error 
resides is different from the Supreme Spirit, when 
you instruct it to regard itself as Brahma, you are 
practising deception. Eor who is it that you so 
instruct? Is it one who is in error? Or is it the 
pure, intelligent, free Brahma ? If the former, you 
have declared, that it is different from Brahma; and, 
consequently, when you teach it, that itself is Brahma, 
you are misleading. If the latter, your labour is quite 
needless. 

It is easy to perceive how the appropriationists 
satisfy themselves, that the soul is Brahma. Brahma, 
they argue, as appropriated to the internal organ, 
does not differ from the pure Brahma ; just as the 
ether appropriated to a jar does not differ from the 
omnipresent ether. To be restored to Brahmahood, 
all that the soul has to do is, to get rid of the internal 
organ, which is false, and simply imagined by ignorance 
to exist : and it is right apprehension which abolishes 
that organ and all its qualities. But how do the 
reflexionists make out the soul to be one with Brahma ? 
With them, as with all other Vedantins, reflexions of 
every description — whether of objects in a mirror, or 
the like, or that of Brahma in the internal organ — are 
false, literally false, as nacrine silver is ; npt false as 
the Sankhyas maintain them to be. And yet they 
are false only as reflexions: in their identity with the 
things reflected, ' they are true. Eor, in the case of 
a reflection, it is held, that what one beholds is the 
thing reflected; only that, through misapprehension, 
it appears to be different from it, and in a place where 



336 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


the thing is not actually located. 1 Similar thereto' 
is naerine silver, which is nothing but nacre under 
the appearance of silver. It is false, as silver, but 
veritable, as nacre. 

Of course, this statement will suggest doubts to the 
reader. First, there is the absurdity of comparing 
a reflexion and whan is reflected to naerine silver $nd 
nacre; and, again, if the soul, which is laid down as. 
being a reflexion of Brahma, is, after all, nothing but 
Brahma, how can it be subject to error? If the soul 
be a reflexion, not when it is viewed as Brahma, but 
only when it is misapprehensively viewed as a reflexion, 
and as something different from Brahma, it comes 
out, that it is a nonentity. 2 Who, moreover, is it that

4 I am that Spirit—consfeitutively eternal apprehension — which 
manifests itself as soul. For, similar to the reflexion of the face

apart from the face— is the soul, the reflexion of intelligence or 
Spirit, in intellects, or internal organs? 

This is the fifth couplet of the Bastamalaha , which is cre- 
dulously imputed to Sankara-icharya. The poem is in high 
esteem among the Vedantins.

sees the soul as a reflexion ? For the soul itself is 
proved to be nothing ; and Brahma is not liable to 
error: and, therefore, a third party is needed to make 
an error here possible. 

But the reader must not allow himself to be perplexed 
or disheartened. If we have already reached what is 
clearly preposterous, there are more things of the 
same character awaiting us. 

It is impossible for us to recognize as soul anything 
other than that which is endowed with apprehension, 
will, and other like qualities ; and the Yedantins assign 
away : these qualities to the internal organ. As for 
what they call ignorance, which they distinguish from 
error, or misapprehension, they are constrained to 
ascribe it to: the pure Brahma, and not to the internal 
organ. If it were a reality, we should be obliged to 
acknowledge, that, in the Vedanta, the soul is Brahma 
himself. But this ignorance, as we shall shortly dis- 
cover, is wholly a thing of the imagination. A some- 
what detailed account of it will now be given; and 
we shall learn what it is, and why the Vedantins are 
unable to refer it to the internal organ, and are forced 
to ascribe it to Brahma.

338 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


The word ‘ ignorance * may mean absence of appre- 
hension, and also misapprehension, or mistake. When 
the Vedantin says, that the world is imagined by 
ignorance, common sense supposes, that he intends, 
by ignorance, misapprehension ; since the absence of 
apprehension cannot imagine. He contends, however, 
that he intends, by it, neither the one nor the otbTer. 1 
Nevertheless, he takes it to be the imaginer of false 
objects, and likewise to be eliminable by right appre- 
hension. More than this, he accounts it a thing 
having an object ; the object being, however, strange 
to say, not falsity, but verity. Accordingly, say what 
the Vedantins may, it seems to me, on taking account 
of the characteristics they attribute to ignorance, that 
it is a combination of two ideas, namely, the absence 
of apprehension whose object is verity, and error in 
mistaking a falsity for a verity : for those characteristics 
fit nothing save such a combination. 

The Vedantins hold ignorance to have verity for its 
object ; and this not a characteristic of mistake : for 
mistake is cognition whose object is falsity ; as, for 
instance, the cognition of nacrine silver. But igno- 
rance, the Vedantins teach, has verity, that is, pure

ranee, it is declared, is a something that cannot be described 
as either existent or non-existent ; constituted of the three gunas ; 
an entity; antagonistic to right apprehension.’ 

The translation runs as if the original were

Brahma, for its object. The Sankshepa-sariraka says ; 

4 The impartite intellect alone is subject and object 
of ignorance .’ 1 They declare, that ignorance of which 
the object is Brahma, is the cause of this world, a false 
thing ; and so, that ignorance, whose object is nacre, 2 
is the cause of false silver. It appears, then, that 
ighorance, since verity is its object, is the absence of 
apprehension of the veritable. For, though the having 
verity for its object cannot be characteristic of absence 
of apprehension — just as it cannot characterize mis- 
take — absence or negation not being an object-having 
thing ; it is characteristic of apprehension. Hence, 
though it cannot be said, that the having verity for 
its object is characteristic of absence of apprehension, 
still, when the Vedantins assert, that ignorance has 
verity for its object, what there is of truth in their 
assertion —their confusion of ideas being rejected- 
may be expressed by saying, that ignorance is the 
absence of apprehension whose object is verity, that is, 
pure Brahma. And this absence of apprehension is, 
in my opinion, the power of concealment which they 
ascribe to ignorance ; that is to say, its faculty of 
hiding verity. 3 For what can concealment of verity 



2 See the extract from the Vedmta-panbhasM , p. 10, cited 
at p. 232. 

* I 373- 





340 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


be but absence of the apprehension of it? But the 
Vedantins, instead of acknowledging this power of 
concealment to be one with ignorance, regard ignorance 
as an entity, of which concealment is a power. 

If they said' no more than this about ignorance, we 
might conclude it to mean simply absence ot appre- 
hension. They consider it, however, to be the imaginer 
of the false world; and to be such an imaginer is the 
work of mistake, not of absence of apprehension. 
Ignorance, then, since they make it to be the imaginer 
of the false world, must be misapprehension, or 
mistake. This mistake is, in my opinion, the Vedantins* 
second power of ignorance, its deluding power. 1 4 Delu- 
sion ' is when the false appears in place of the 
veritable; and this is mistake. But the Vedantins,

two faculties, known as concealment and delusion. The 
faculty of concealment * * * is a power such that, by it ,

as it were covers Spirit, unlimited and irrelate to the world,’

faculty of delusion is a power thus illustrated . As ignorance 
about a rope produces, by its own force, a false snake, or the 
like, in the rope which it conceals; so radical ignorance, viz., 
that concerning $uie Brahma, brings forth, by its own orce, 
in the Spirit which itself conceals, the universe, made up of 
ether and the rest.* 



THE SOUL AND: THE SUPREME : SPIRiT 341 


instead of owning this power of delusion to be one 
with ignorance, hold it to be a power of ignorance. 

I will show how the Vedantins here fall into error. 
Our cognition of the external world, that is, perception, 
inference, etc., is, to their thinking, misapprehension ; 1 
and, in order to keep Brahma pure from it, they 
appropriate it to the internal organ. But this wrong 
cognition they cannot identify with ignorance; since 
they are bent on making ignorance to be the cause of 
the whole world, so that it may be established as false. 
If they had said, that ignorance is mistake, an affection 
of the internal organ, then it might be, for them, the 
imaginer of the external world. But how could it 
imagine the internal organ ? And, if it does not, the 
internal organ cannot be proved, as they would prove 
it, to be false. Therefore, with intent to make igno- 
rance the imaginer of the internal organ also, 2 they 
insist, that it is something different from mistake. 3 
And here they are forced into fresh and greater 
absurdities. 

i See the couplet cited in the Veddnta-panbashd , given at

* Thy mind, generated by thy ignorance, imagines the entire

This half-couplet is from the Sankshepa-iariraka. 

3 It is remarkable, that Sankara Aeharya himself was un- 
guarded in the language he employed regarding this doctrine. 
In the passage quoted below, he makes ignorance to be one 

with mistake . l 



342 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

When the Vedantins contend, that* ignorance is 
something different from mistake, though they call 

‘Misapprehension of this description, just before laid down 
the learned hold to be nescience.’ But Ramananda, his com- 
mentator, redresses his laxity : *PFcT 

1 < The import is, that they consider misapprehension > 

as being the product of nescience, to be itself nescience,’ Seo 
the Bibliotheca Indica, No. 64, p. 16. 

Here it may be observed, once for all, that, alike as to the 
Vedanta, and as to the other systems of Hindu philosophy, 
the higher we ascend the stream of time, the more ^frequent 
do we find unphilosophical inexactness of phraseology. This 
inexactness is, of course, most frequent of all in the works of 
the inventors of those systems. Their care, it should seem, was 
well-nigh exclusively bestowed upon broad principles; and the 
result was somewhat of vagueness, at least, in their modes of 
expression. Subsequent writers, as commentators and others 
have, to be sure, amended the phraseology of their predecessors, 
But it has been with a view to remove the appearance of 
inconsistency in them • it has not at all been with any intention 
of introducing new doctrines. These they have not introduced. 

Of this assertion a justification is offered m the extract, and 
the annotation thereon, just adduced. With Sankara, following 
the Upanishads, apprehension— whether correct or erroneous- 
will, activity, etc., are properties of the eternal organ ; and, 
further, the whole universe, including the internal organ, is 
false, and imagined by ignorance, or nescience. How, then, in 
accordance with his views could misapprehension and nescience 
be identical? 

It is desirable to keep e\ er before the mind the fact, that an 
uninitiated reader will come upon hundreds of terms and state- 
ments, in the expositions of Sankara and other early Vedantins, 
which, though seeming, at first sight, contradictory of many 
things asserted in this volume, are, in fact, not so , a right 
understanding of them requiring that they should be understood 
with certain qualifications. In order to, a full acquaintance 
-with these qualifications, a thorough-going study of the whoje

itf the imaginer of this false world, how can they 
say, that its imagining is like that of mistake? For 
mistake imagines by imputing existence to the non- 
existent; and hence its object is called false. The 
Vedantins, in calling the world imagined of ignorance, 
with a view to establish its falsity, ought to have 
ta&n the imagining of ignorance to be like that of 
mistake; but this was difficult for them to admit, 
since they had already erred in viewing ignorance as 
a thing different' from mistake. And see the difficulty 
consequent to therm Their ‘ignorance,’ or illusion, 
like the ‘nature’ of the Sankhyas, now ‘begins to 
appear to them an incognitive substance; and, as 
such, what sort of imagining can it possess? Like 
that of the 4 nature ’ of the Sankhyas, and that of the 
atoms of the Naiyayikas, it is no longer imagining, 
but positively the material cause of the whole world. 
And what now? Does the world turn out to be true, 
and does non-duality disappear, and duality supersede 
it? To this one would be brought, reasoning from 
their account of ignorance. Yet these results they 
utterly repudiate. The verity of the world they will 
never grant. If they did, all their toil would be to 
no purpose. Neither could the soul be Brahma, nor 
could emancipation come from right apprehension; as' 
.will be made clear in the ninth chapter. The belief, 
that the internal organ, etc., the whole world, are 
false, is the very life of the monistic doctrine. How- 
ever, as has been shown, such is the waywardness 

scheme of the Vedanta is indispensable No criticism, that 
d,oes not rest on a wide basis of Vedanta research, can be held 
satisfactory.

Nowhere, of a truth, but in the reveries of the 
Vedanfcins.* 

Waiving, however, all this, and taking the words 
of Yedantins as they deliver them, I urge, that, if 
the soul be ignorant, it cannot be identical with 
Brahma; for he, in their belief, is ever pure, intelli- 
gent, and free. 1

premises, misapprehension cannot exist, no more can a second 
thing, a cause thereof. Besides , for such as subscribe to mis- 
apprehension, or a cause of it, as an entity additional to Brahma, 
monism evaporates. To continue, whence sprang Brahma’s 
misapprehension ? For there is no other cause with you , Brahma 
being the sole entity. If it be said, that it is natural to him , 
how, pray, can he whose nature is science be he whose nature 
is nescience ? ’ 



THE SOUL AND THE SUPEEME .SPIRIT 847 

* But the Vedantins, though they are forced to locate 
ignorance in Brahma, still, in order to make him out 
to be essentially ever pure, intelligent, and free,, main- 
tain that ignorance itself is false. Most wonderful 
is this of all their wonders. And how is ignorance 
considered, by them, to be false? I must now address 
myself to answer this question. 

On hearing, that the Vedantins regard ignorance 
as the cause of the world’s appearing to be true, one 
would, of course, suppose, that this ignorance was 
understood, by them, to be itself true. Eor if igno- 
rance did not actually exist, how could the world, 
which they hold to be a nonentity, have appearance? 
When a man mistakingly sees a snake in a rope, the 
snake is called false. At the same time, that man’s 
misapprehension is not said to be false, but true. 
The Vedantins, however, maintain that ignorance is 
false. We ought, therefore, to inquire, how it is 
reckoned false, and what is gained to the Vedanta 
system by so reckoning it. 

To the first inquiry we get two answers from the 
Vedantins. One is given by those whose mastery of 
their doctrine is not perfect; while the other is re- 
turned by such as have penetrated their system to 
its innermost arcana. The latter answer I shall speak 
of in the next chapter. The former, that which one 
hears from the bulk of Hindus nowadays, I shall 
examine briefly at once. 

This answer is, that ignorance is called false, inas- 
much as it is eliminated by the supervening of right 
apprehension. But this is highly absurd. That is 
false which does not exist at all; but that which 



m THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

exists, and is destroyed at a given time, is not falser, 
but uneternal and perishable. 1 If a Vedantin replies, 
that, in his technical language, false means uneternal, 
I have to say, that the fault of ignorance in the 
ignorant Brahma cannot be got rid of by thus de- 
nominating his ignorance; nor can you thus prove 
him to be essentially pure, intelligent, and free. The 
goodness or badness of a thing depends upon its 
nature, not upon the epithets applied to it. Suppose, 
that some one held in general esteem goes mad; 
whereat his friends are in great grief. A man comes 
and assures them, that he is not mad; his madness 
is false. And he adds, that, according to his own 
way of speaking, he only is really mad, who has 
been so from birth. The person miscalled mad was 
quite in his right mind for the first five and twenty 
years of his life ; and, therefore, his madness is false. 
Would this speech be of any consolation to the friends 
of the respected maniac ? Without doubt, the Supreme 
Spirit is essentially ever pure, intelligent, and free — 
in the right sense of these terms; and He is so 
indefeasibly. Any so-called sacred book that asserts 
the contrary confutes, by its blasphemy, its preten- 
sions to divine origin; and there can be no more 
certain mark of a false religion than such an assertion. 
In maintaining, .that Brahma, as they describe him, 

1 Just as Parthasarathi says, in arguing against the Ve- 
dantins, with reference to the universe. His words are

proved to be non-eternal, not false,* 



THE SOUL AND THE SUPEEME SPIBIT 349 

is the Supreme Spirit, and in attributing to that Spirit 
unworthy and debasing attributes, the Vedantins, 
though unconsciously, do Him the foulest dishonour. 

Ordinary Vedantins, whom one meets, those who- 
know their doctrine but superficially, though they 
speak as I have stated, about the falsity of ignorance, 
entertain, in their minds, a different view. They do 
not merely believe, as they say they do, that ignorance 
is perishable, and therefore false , for Brahma, they 
cannot but feel, would not thus be freed from all defect. 
They indeed believe, like their better-informed co- 
religionists, that ignorance is absolutely nothing what- 
soever ; only they are at a loss to explain themselves. 



CHAPTER VIII 


Criticism of the Vedanta Tenet of the Falseness of 
Ignorance, as set forth in Standard Treatises, and 
as held by Well-read Advocates of the Theory. 

Vedantins, who have attained to a thorough compre- 
hension of their system, maintain, that ignorance is 
imagined by ignorance, and therefore is false. You 
will ask, imagined by what ignorance? The answer 
is, by itself. To this purpose the Sankshepa-tariraka 
says : 1 In the case of the ignorant one, ignorance is 
not of its essence ; since, for ignorance to be essential 
to it would belie its nature— intelligence, unchange- 
able, and without a second. Assuredly, ignorance is 
caused by ignorance exclusively. Nor may self-sup- 
portedness here be charged: for, as spirit proves the 
existence of everything knowable, and of itself also, 
from possessing the power of cognition; similarly, 
self-ignorance may imagine itself and other things. 
Thus there is no difficulty.’ 1 If, endeavouring to

establish such an impossibility as is here propounded, 
the Vedantins get confused, and plunge deeper than

Sarvajnatman denies, as we have seen, that his position

ever into error, small is the wonder. To illustrate 
the notion, that ignorance imagines itself, the author 
just cited instances the soul, which, through cognition, 
proves the existence of itself, no less than that of 
things external. But where is the parallelism ? The 
illustration adduced is of no pertinence, except to 
decoy a man into a maze of words, and then to beguile 
him by a semblance of reasonableness. The author 
says, that the soul, by its cognition, proves, that 
external objects exist, and itself also. But, in proving 
their existence, does it imagine them ? Not at all. 
They were already actually in being ; and the soul 
does not invent them, either in imagination, or verit- 
ably. Hence, 4 to prove the existence of/ as we find 
the phrase used above, means only ‘ to apprehend 
that is, £ to certify as existent \ A person resolved *on 
finding the Vedanta rational, may here insist,* that the 
author intends to show nothing more than what he 
said in the case of the soul, to wit, that ignorance 
proves its own existence; in other words, that it, 
already existing, ascertains that it is so. If so, I reply, 
ignorance is made out to be a verity. As our rational- 
izer would interpret it, the extract 13 quite out of 
place. Eurther, on his showing, the contradiction 
which the author deprecates remains intact. Any 
one who is thoroughly conversant with the Vedanta 
will acknowledge, that, when its teachers discourse of 
ignorance after the manner of the verses I have cited, 
their purpose is, to prove, that ignorance is false— 

It as because the case in question is one of 4 self-supported- 
ness,’ that Vijnana thus explains ‘mutual dependence’. 

Aphorism 14 of Book V is included in the above, 



THE FALSENESS OF IGNOEANOE 353 


just as naerine silver is — and, therefore, that the 
soul is essentially ever pure, intelligent, and free. 

The Sankshepa-s&riraka is an authority of the first 
rank, and it may be thought incredible, that it can 
be so weak as I have represented it to be. In an- 
ticipation of misgiving, I add, from the commentary 
o£ Purushottama Misra, the Subodhmt, his exposition 
of the verses in question. — 

* But, one may object, since ignorance, an eternal 
entity, is, like Brahma, impossible of elimination, how 
is emancipation, which consists in the elimination 
thereof, to be effected? Its being elimmable by right 
apprehension, on the ground of its falseness, is thus 
established: “In the case of the ignorant one,” etc. 
“Jo explain.” Is the relation of ignorance to the 
ignorant one essential ? Or is it imagined ? It is not 
the former: “not of its essence”. Why? “Since, for 
ignorance to be essential ”, etc. If ignorance were in 
spirit essentially, it would be a true entity: but it 
cannot abide as true in a thing which is self-luminous 
intelligence, as spirit is ; since light is repugnant to 
darkness. Again, if ignorance were a property of 
spirit, its being destroyed would alter the spirit, 
according to the maxim, “ A property, acceding, or 
seceding, changes its subject.” Moreover, if ignorance 
were a true entity, the result would be duality. Hence, 
it is meant, there would be contradiction to the 
scripture which declares, that spirit is intelligence, 
^unchangeable, and without a second. The latter is 
admitted: “Assuredly, ignorance”, etc. The facts 
standing thus, there is no antagonism, even as there

is none between the midday glare and the gloom for 
which the owl mistakes it. Such is the import.* 1 
As appears clearly from the words of the com- 
mentator himself, the author intends to establish, that 
ignorance is altogether false. That the commentator 
thus understands his intent is purged of all doubt 
by the illustration of the owl. The darkness whieh 
the bird is supposed to recognize, is purely fictitious. 
In like manner, ignorance, it is maintained, is nothing 
whatever, and yet imagines itself to exist.

- I would ask, then, what resemblance there is between 
ignorance’s imagining itself, and the soul’s proving 
the existence of itself and of other objects? But 
observe, that the author’s word jprasffdhayaU , 'proves 
as existent is somewhat liable to mislead. In its 
connexion, it can signify, only ‘certifies as existent’. 
It’ looks, however, as if it had the sense of ‘makes’, 
or ‘ contrives ’ ; and the transition from this to 
‘ invents or ‘ imagines ’, is not very violent. We now 
see how the author, beguiled by words, came to the 
conclusion, that the illustration produced by him was 
a valid proof that ignorance may imagine itself to 
exist. Deluded himself, he deludes others. 

Thus, in one respect, that illustration is inapposite. 
Still more so is it in another respect. As regards 
the soul, it exists, and therefore certifies as existent 
itself and other objects. On the other hand, how 
can ignorance, if it be nothing, imagine itself, or 
anything else? This is a sample of the gross absur- 
dities which the Vedantms acquiesce in ; and not only 
are they not abashed by them, but they are perfectly 
satisfied with them. For instance, Purushottama 
Misra, near the words I have taken from him, says, 
‘In this system, which maintains that everything tran- 
scends explanation, unreasonableness is no objection.’ 1 
To accept such views as I have been treating of, 
supposes abolition of all right judgement. As I ob- 
served once before, there are many things pertaining 
to God, and to other spiritual matters, which our 


1 i 



356 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

minds arc incompetent] to lay hold of, and which only 
bewilder us, the more we reflect on them. Still, if 
constraining evidence presents itself for believing those 
things, we are bound to believe them. But, if we 
receive as true, things which we cannot help per- 
ceiving to be false, what are we not to receive ? Why 
are we not to hold, that Brahma is nothing, and that 
the soul is nothing ? It is for the reason to decide 
these points ; and we are not to imitate the Vedantins 
in abnegating reason, as they do, when it suits their 
purpose. 

Utterances similar to that which I have extracted 
from the Sankshejoa-ianraka, will be found in the 
Stddhanta-leta, among other books. All those works 
lay it down, that, as the world is false, is imagined 
by ignorance, and appears only by reason of ignorance, 
so — the very pivot of the Vedanta system — ignorance 
is imagined by ignorance, in other words, is nothing, 
and, from ignorance alone, seems to be something. 1 

l This doctrine we may find in the Vedanta-sara even, 
though not enunciated very conspicuously. At p, 4 of that 

work we read:

thing in a veritable thing , as a snake in a rope, winch, m

veritable thing is Brahma— the existent, intelligence, and ]oy — 
without a second, the false thing is the sum total of the in- 
animate, viz., ignorance and so forth.’ 

That whereby false things are here imagined in the veritable 
thing, Brahma, is ignorance. And ignorance itself is reckoned 



THE EALSENESS OE IGNOEANCE 357 


Let us dwell upon this extraordinary and extrava- 
gant doctrine a little longer. I say to the Vedantins : 
If, in order to make out ignorance to be false, you 
assert, that it is imagined by ignorance, how does it 
not occur to you, that, on the supposition of its being 
nothing, it is impossible for it to imagine anything, 
either itself, or the world? And whence, if it be 
nothing, is the appearance, of the false world? Your 
ready answer is, that you do not pronounce ignorance 
to be altogether nothing. I ask, what sort of thing 
is it, then ? You reply, that it is an imagination of 
ignorance. To this I rejoin, that an imagination of 
ignorance is nothing: and, if it be considered to be 
something, your labour is all fruitless , since, in that 
case, the soul forfeits its character of being essentially 
ever pure, intelligent, and free. To this you say, that 
ignorance is not nothing , that its being self -imagined 
proves it to be unreal only from the standing point 
of true existence, and that it is not shown to be 
quite unreal. Ignorance is imagined by ignorance* 
and hence is called apparent ; 1 and what is so is not 
entirely nothing, but possesses apparent existence* 

among those false things which are thus imagined. Clearly, 
therefore, ignorance is held to be self-imagined. 

This is plainly the \iew touching ignorance taken by the 
author of the Sankhya Aphorism, and by Vijnana Bhikshu, 
his expositor. See the note at p. 354. 

l The author would here repeat, that he has not come across 
any passage in which ignorance is said to be apparent, and 
not practical. His authority, though good of its kind, is only 
oral. It is shown, however, at p. 355, that it matters nothing, 
in effect, in the Vedanta system, whether ignorance be of the 
one sort or of the other. 



358 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

Eor existence is of three kinds. That which fs 
nothing whatsoever is known as non-existent ; as the 
son of a barren woman, for example : 1 and ignorance, 
only if it were allowed to have true existence, would 
prove fatal to the character of spirit as being, by 
nature, ever pure, intelligent, and free. 

But see to what the Vedantins thus come. On the 
one hand, they take ignorance to be nothing at all; 
—for, otherwise, Brahma could not be essentially 
ever pure, intelligent, and free — and, to prove this 
very point, they assert, that ignorance is self-imagined. 
On the other hand, by giving to that ignorance the 
epithet of apparent, they at once begin to see a little 
existence in it — -just enough to avail for its self- 
imagination. They come to such a pass, that the 
term real, since they take it to signify both false and 
real, is useless towards distinguishing the one from 
the other. We ask them, whether, in their appre- 
hension, that which they declare to be apparent really 
exists ; for, if it does not, it can do nothing. Yes, it 
really exists, they tell us, but as apparent. What 
can be done for such reasoners ? What words can we 
employ to convey our meaning to them, and to dis- 
cover to them what is real and what is false, in other 
words, what is and what is not ? Our only course, 
it seems to me, is, to discuss with them the subject 
of their three kinds of existence, the true, the practical, 
and the apparent, and to point out to them the error 
of those distinctions. 


1 See the second note on p. 227, 



CHAPTER IX 


Examination of the Tenet of the Ved&niins, that there 
are Three Kinds : of Existence , Ignorance cannot 
be False , and, therefore , the Ignorant Soul cannot 
be one with the Supreme Spirit • 

Before I criticize the doctrine of three kinds of 
existence, I would bespeak from the Vedantin the 
strictest attention. Without it, he will never be able 
to get at the truth. Let him lay aside his usual habits 
of thought for a short hour; and, while listening to 
what I have to offer, let him take account of his 
present consciousness. 

When you, Vedantin, are assured, with respect to 
a given thing, that it indeed is, you have a conviction, 
that its existence is real. And did you ever feel, that 
the real existence of one thing, recognized by you as 
existing, was different from the real existence of any 
other thing so recognized? Do not all things which 
you perceive to exist at all, approve themselves to 
exist in one and the same manner? Again, when a 
thing appears to you to be non-existent, does it not 
appear to you to be simply and altogether so, and 
nothing more or less? It results, that whatever is is, 



360 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

and that whatever is not is altogether not — with no 
room for a third condition. How, then, can yon prove 
various sorts of existence? 

But here the Vedantin’s philosophical prejudice gets 
the better of him; and he declares, that he has a 
consciousness of sundry sorts of existence: for he 
says, that, when he mistakes a rope for a snake, he 
becomes conscious of apparent existence; 1 it apper- 
taining to such a snake. When, however, you commit 
such a mistake, does the existence of the snake seem 
to you different from that of a jar, or the like? Does 
not the existence seem to be, in both instances, equally 
real? Undoubtedly, it does. How, then, is it made 
out, that, in mistaking a rope for a snake, you become 
conscious of a second kind of existence ? You will 
reply, that, by reason of mistake, you look upon the 
snake’s existence to be like that of a jar, or similar 
thing; but that they who know, that the object before 
you is a rope, call the snake, seen by you, apparent: 
and, on that account, to their apprehension, your con- 
sciousness concerns an apparent existence. Let them 
apprehend as they may, what do you apprehend? 
You are then conscious of the one sort of existence 
that you are habitually conscious of. As for the im- 
pression of the lookers-on, do they see any description 
of snake? Not at all. They are perfectly satisfied, 
that no snake is there. So, neither has a man 
labouring under mistake, nor one that does not so 
labour, any consciousness of apparent exxstence; nor 
can either of them prove such a thing to be. You 


1 See pp 232, etc. 



THBEE KINDS OE EXISTENCE 


361 


will reply, that you are constrained to call such a 
thing apparent, ‘for, otherwise, how shall we name 
a thing that is not, and yet appears; as a snake 
surmised in a rope ? ’ But how idle to trouble your- 
self about naming that which never had any being 1 
That which is not, but only seems, through error, 
to be, is altogether non-existent, and why should you 
name it? 

But the Vedantins say, that, when one mistakes 
a rope for a snake, the mistake is one of perception. 
Perception, however, cannot take place without the 
connexion of an object and an organ of sense. Hence, 
if, in the case instanced, you did not grant, that there 
was some sort of snake, there would be nothing for 
the eye to have connexion with, and there would be 
no mistake of perception. 1 My reply is, that the mis- 
take in question is not perceptional, but inferential. 
Our senses can take cognizance of the qualities of 
things, as their colour, taste, length, etc , etc., but of 
nothing beyond these. When, therefore, a man mis- 
takes a rope for a snake, he merely cognizes, with 
his eye, something long; and there is no mistake in 
this. And then he infers, that the something long is 
a snake. But the fact of being a snake is not in- 
variably concomitant 2 with length ; for many things 
besides snakes are long. Hence, since the reason — 
the length — is fallacious, the inference — that a snake 
is present — is erroneous. The mistake of supposing 
a snake to be seen being, accordingly, not a mistake 

l See the passages from the Yeddnta-peonbMska, pp. 10 and 
13, quoted at pp. 232 and 233. 

9 This phraseology is that of the Nyaya, 



862 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


of perception, it is not necessary to hold that a snake 
is produced. 

You, Vedantms, give to objects of mistake the de- 
signation of apparent. But mistake is where there is 
no object, and yet the notion of it. Consider, now, 
what are the requisites that make mistake to be mis- 
take ? In the hist place, there is no object, in mis- 
take an object is wanting. The notion of it is all 
that remains; and beyond this there is nothing. 
Whence, then, do you get an apparent object? Is it 
brought forth by a mere notion? Know, for a cer- 
tainty, that, when a man mistakes a rope for a snake, 
there are only two things. One is the rope; and the 
other is, the man’s mistake in surmising it to be a 
snake. There is nothing else; and there never was; 
and there never will be. 

Hearing this, the Yedantin asks, in great astonish- 
ment, whether apparent things are altogether non- 
existent. He wishes to know, what difference there 
is left between such objects and the son of a barren 
woman. 1 Why do you think, I ask, that there is 
any? 2 But there is, he insists, an immense difference; 
for that apparent things are, once in a while, sur- 
mised by people, whereas no one ever surmises the 
son of a barren woman. My reply is, that the differ- 
ence is merely one of surmise, not of object. The 
son of a barren woman is not surmised, for the obvious 
reason that, whoever knows what is meant when 
a barren woman is spoken of, is aware that she is

surmises such a son J And so, can one who knows 
a given thing to be a rope ever mistake it for a snake? 
He alone who does not know it to he a rope, so 
mistakes. Similarly, one who does not know what is 
intended by a barren woman, may take her to be 
a mother. How you encumber a simple matter with 
difficulties ! 

Let it be, the Vedantin here concedes, that a rope 
mistaken for a snake, and nacre mistaken for silver, 
and like things, have been shown to be quite unreal. 
But he will still maintain, that the things of the 
world cannot be so. Eor, he will say, we have dealings 
with them ; and for this reason— though, like apparent 
things, they are imagined by ignorance and our learned 
men believe them to be apparent — for the readier 
apprehension of the uninformed, they are called practi- 
cal. If they were altogether unreal, how could we 
deal with them ? In reply, I ask, whether the dealing 
is real, or unreal ? The Vedantin answers, that it is 
practically real, and yet not indeed real. And does 
he not call it ignorance-imagined? He does, he says. 
And what does he mean by that term, which he applies 
to practical dealing and to things practical? Does he 
mean appearing, by reason of ignorance to exist ? Or, 
derived from a substance termed ignorance, after the 
manner of a germ from a seed ? To this interrogatory 
he may return one or other of the following answers 
If he speaks from the promptings of common sense, 
he may say, that ‘ignorance-imagined’ means ‘appear- 
ing, by reason of ignorance, to have existence On the 
other hand, should he be thoroughly ensnared by the 



m THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

phraseology of the Vedanta, he will probably say, that* 
it signifies ‘ derived from ignorance ’, or illusion — an 
unintelligent substance, and the material cause of 
the world, like the ‘ nature ’ of the Sankhya scheme. 
If such, I say to him, be the case, the existence of 
ignorance and of ignorance-imagmed things does not 
differ from that of Brahma. And why, then, do you 
not call practical dealing and things practical indeed 
real? If you reply, that things sprung from illusion 
are denominated, in your peculiar language, practical 
only, and that the distinction of true is restricted to 
Brahma, I have to say, that, by these terms, you 
discriminate by class, not by existence ; and thus 
your divisions of existence fall to the ground. In 
like manner the Naiyayikas style some things limited 
in dimension, and others, unlimited ; and, again, some, 
terrene, and others, igneous, etc.: and is difference as 
to existence thereby implied respecting them ? And do 
you mark any difference as to existence, by calling, 
technically, and so only, one object true, and another, 
practical ? Both are alike real. And, since both are 
real what becomes of the dogma of monism, or non- 
duality ? Can monism be established by simply show- 
ing, that two things are different in kind? If so, 
the Naiyayikas, no less than you, are monists ; for 
they hold, that Isvara differs, in very many respects, 
from everything else. 

Further, if ignorance does not mean mistake, how 
is this world got rid of by knowledge ? For nothing 
except what is mistaken is falsified thereby. But, if 
the world be made out of ignorance, as a jar is made 
out of clay, knowledge can never do away with the 



THREE KINDS OE EXISTENCE 


365 


world. When I find out, that what I mistook for a 
snake is a rope, the supposed snake is dispelled ; but 
what knowledge is such that it can do away with a 
jar which stands before me? Take a club and break 
it, and it is destroyed, to be sure. Knowledge, how- 
ever, cannot destroy it. And, as the world is not 
falsifiable by knowledge, so your material cause of 
the world, illusion, if it be not one with mistake, is 
not to be got rid of by knowledge ; and then the 
soul’s connexion with the world, and remaining m 
bondage, are real , and, therefore, the soul cannot 
be Brahma The sense of the term ignorance being 
paltered with, everything, with you, is inverted. The 
authors of your system must, by ‘ignorance’, originally 
have intended ‘ mistake \ l when they spoke of the 
world . as being ignorance-imagined , and by this 
epithet they meant to mark things as seeming, by- 
reason of mistake, to have existence. Subsequently, 
entrapped by sophistry, they began to take a different 
view of those expressions. Had they not understood 
them in the way I have shown, the falseness of the 
world, and monism, and the removableness of ignorance 
by knowledge, etc., would never have been suggested 
to them. By this time, indeed, it will be conceded, 
that the phrase ‘ ignorance-imagined ’ can endure no 
sense but that which I attach to it. Accordingly, 
since it means ‘appearing, because of ignorance, to 

l Such being the only natural and intelligible conception of, 
ajntina , ‘ignorance’, regarded as the imagmer of false objects. 
Sankara Achan a, not entirely disengaged from this conception, 
could, as we have seen, speak of ‘ignorance’ as one with 
‘mistake’, though m the teeth of his own doctrine. 



366 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

exist’, Low can a thing so called exist? That which* 
is not, but appears to be, can be said to seem, from 
ignorance, to exist. As for what is, and appears to 
be, it does not seem, from ignorance, but from knowl- 
edge, to have existence. How can a thing of the 
former description have existence P Does ignorance 
bring it forth, as a snake produces eggs ? As, in 
discussing the subject of the apparent, I remarked, 
so now I repeat, that, when one says a thing is not, 
but is cognized, one denies its existence and affirms 
only the cognition of it , beyond which there is nothing. 
How, then, can your practical be established? And, 
as you call practical things ignorance-imagined, so 
you call practical dealing likewise; whence it follows, 
that the latter also is unreal. Then, in order to 
account for such practical dealing — unreal, and seeming, 
because of ignorance, to exist — what necessity is there 
for supposing any kind of real existence in that with 
which it is concerned ? If a man has dreamed, that 
he mounted a horse, is there any need of his attri- 
buting any kind of existence to such horse ? In short, 
to be consistent, you ought to regard the things of 
the world as altogether non-existent, just like nacrine 
silver and the son of a barren woman. 

According to your notions, the difference between 
your three species of objects turns on cognition. 
There is invariable cognition, occasional cognition, 
and the absence of cognition. Such are the charac- 
teristics of those three species. To the first belong the 
things of this world ; to the second, nacrine silver and 
the like; and, to rhe third, the son of a barren 
woman. But do not suppose, that these objects there- 



THEEE KINDS OE EXISTENCE 367 

fore differ among themselves. It is true, that, 9ven 
to objects purely imaginary we are obliged to give 
names, and, if the cognition of one such object differs 
from the cognition of another, it is permissible, on 
account of that difference to attach different names to 
those objects. Hence, if you only denominated one 
ciass of nonentities practical, and another class, ap- 
parent, I should not blame you What I find fault with 
you for is this, that the terms practical and apparent 
suggest to you two separate kinds of real existence. 

Now I wish to explain the nature of existence 
briefly, and to point out how you err concerning it. 
Consider, that, when you affirm, as regards what you 
call a true, a practical, or an apparent, object, that it 
is ; m so affirming, you acknowledge, that its existence 
is* in all three cases, of the same description. What, 
then, becomes of their difference as to existence, 
•which you affirm ? If you say to yourself, that those 
objects themselves are of different sorts, namely, true, 
practical, and apparent, and that, therefore, they differ 
with respect to existence, I assure you, that this is a 
mistake. Let it be granted, that they are different, of 
different species: this fact does not concern their 
existing, any more than does the fact, that the 
Naiyayikas divide certain things into limited and un- 
limited, establish, that those things have various sorts 
of existence. If the difference you contend for were 
a reality, it would be based on mental premises. 
Thus, when we say, that salt water is different from 
sweet, we can both conceive the ground of the 
difference, and we can express it in words. But, when 
you say, concerning objects of three kinds, true, etc,, 



368 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

that they are, do you picture to yourself any founda- 
tion for their existing diversely? Do not say, that 
there are some objects which really differ, but yet the 
grounds of their differing are not to be known ; and 
that, in like manner, the ground of the difference 
between the existences belonging to true and other 
things is so subtile as to be impossible of discovery. 
It is only those things that you are not fully acquainted 
with, of which you can allege, that you are un- 
acquainted with the ground of their differing. Of 
whatever things you are certain, whether from per- 
ception, from inference, or otherwise, that it is, you 
know the existence of that thing already. It may be, 
that you are ignorant of its nature , still you are not 
ignorant; of its existence. However you came by your 
information, as soon as you know, that a thing Is, 
you are fully aware of its existence. Similarly, if you 
are sure, that what you style true things, and practi- 
cal, and apparent, are, you are fully informed of their 
existence; and, if they are discrepant as to existence, 
you must know how they differ. If you do not know 
how they differ, but if it is clear, from your applying 
‘is’ to each of them, that they all appear to exist in 
one and the same way, what reason have you for 
speaking of three species of existence? 

If you have understood me hitherto, listen a little 
further. You said, that you believe in different 
existences of true, practical, and apparent objects, 
because those objects themselves differ mutually ; 
and you remember my reply, based on a concession, 1 


1 See pp. 368-4. 



THBEE KINDS OF EXISTENCE 


m 


But now I protest against your classification of objects, 
heretofore granted for argument's sake. Unlike the 
Naiyayika division of things into limited and unlimited, 
it is grounded simply on your supposed difference in 
the nature of the existence of the aforesaid objects; 
and it falls to the ground with the fall of that 
difference. 

I have now to say, that, even though you proved 
the world to be imagined by ignorance, and false, 
still you should not call that ignorance false. When, 
to make out ignorance to be false, you style it 
ignorance-imagined, does it not occur to you, that, if 
it were false, that is to say, no entity, it could not 
exercise imagination? In evasion of this question, 
you lay down, that ignorance, though ignorance- 
imagined j and, therefore, not real from the standing 
point of true existence, is not altogether nothing; it 
being apparent. What can be replied to such an 
absurdity? Whatever is ignorance-imagined, and, by 
consequence, not indeed real, is a sheer nonentity, 
and can imagine nothing. 

Sometimes, the Vedantins declare, even things that 
owe their origin entirely to mistake, and are false, are 
able to produce effects For instance, what is seen 
in dreams foreshows, it is said, good and evil. 1 Here, 
too, in my opinion, the Vedantins, from want of right

consideration, are wide of the truth. Things that we 
see in dreams do not foreshow, as they allege they 
do; for such things are nonentities. Dreams them- 
selves may foreshow; and these are entities. The 
object of a misconception is false; but the conception 
itself is true. When a man mistakes a rope for a 
snake, and is put in bodily fear, we are not to under- 
stand, as the Vedantins do, 1 that the snake — for that 
is nothing — but that the man’s misconception, which 
is entitative, is the cause of his fear. 

By all these considerations it is proved, that, if, as

♦The preceptor alone, albeit imaginary, because all-sapient, 
gives instruction to the full ; as it is the snake, albeit imaginary, 
and not the befouled ether, that operates for death.’ 

The sense is this. Among things imagined, some may produce 
effects which are beyond the power of other things. Thus, a 
man may be fatally terrified by a rope mistaken for a snake; 
whereas the foul ether, an object equally chimerical, cannot 
work to the same end. Just so, an instructor, no less than all 
other men, is imaginary and false ; and yet he is able to 
instruct, which other men are not. 

In Hindu opinion, the ether is always essentially colourless 
and pure, and only from error is supposed to possess hue. 
The ignorant, it is said, think the blueness of the sky to be 
the befoulment of ether. 

The couplet cited above is from the SankskepOridrtra'ka, 



THREE KINDS OF EXISTENCE 371 

tile Vedantins maintain, the regarding the world as 
true, and the believing oneself to be a soul, are the 
result of ignorance, then that ignorance cannot be 
false, but must be true; and hence, we are indeed 
ignorant, and, consequently, we cannot be the Supreme 
Spirit. 

And just as true are our sinfulness and misery. 
For there is sin in one’s desiring or doing anything 
which one counts to be wrong : and there are many 
things which, though we so count them, we all desire 
and do ; and we are, likewise, all conscious of misery. 
In treating of the Sankhya system, I have shown, 
that our consciousness of cognition, will, activity, 
misery, etc., cannot be an error. Since, then, our souls 
are sinful, and subject to misery, for this further 
reason, they cannot be the Supreme Spirit; which, as 
the Vedantins confess, is ever pure, and essentially joy. 

After adverting to a single topic more, I shall bring 
this chapter to a close. When I was discussing the 
Sankhya, I set down what would be enough to refute 
the Vedanta as well I said, that our consciousness of 
•cognition, will, etc. — however we may err as to other 
things— cannot be erroneous. Consequently, even 
were I to allow the correctness of the Vedantins’ 
allegation, that to regard the world as true is a mis- 
conception, yet so to regard it cannot be false; since 
we are conscious, that we have a cognition of the 
world’s truth: a cognition which the Vedantins call 
erroneous. I repeat, that, if such a misconception as 
that just spoken of actually infects us, we cannot be 
the Supreme Spirit. Thus, also, am I able to answer 
the Vedantins. It was necessary, however, to examine 



m THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

and to expose, from various aspects, the arguments 
they produce to prove the falsity of ignorance; for 
therein, as I have before said, consists the whole 
strength of the Vedanta doctrine. It was of main im- 
portance, also, to refute their errors touching the sub- 
ject of existence, those errors being most prejudicial 
to them in several ways. The labour I have expended 
on this head should not, then, be viewed as uncalled 
for. 



CHAPTER X 


Examination of the Vedantiris Emancipation; Proof , 
that the Vedanta does not deserve to be called 
Theistic; and a few Words on the Faculty of 
Judgement , its Power , and its Use . 

When the notion is refuted, that the soul is identical 
with Brahma, the refutation follows, by implication, 
of the notion, that, when the soul attains to right 
apprehension, viz., the regarding itself as one with 
Brahma, t it becomes liberated from all error, and, 
being Brahma realized , 1 is emancipated. Bor, since 
the soul is not at all Brahma, its thinking itself to 
be so is not right apprehension, but the extreme of 
misapprehension; and, for thus thinking, instead of 
deserving to be emancipated, it deserves severe 
punishment. 

i This word is a makeshift; and so is ‘reflexion’, used at 
pp, 336-7, and elsewhere. It is impossible to express m rational 
language what becomes of the soul, when Vedantically emanci- 
pated. From all eternity it has been Brahma, and therefore 
has not to become Brahma, or again, to be restored to Brahma- 
hood. Nor does it realize Brahmahood; inasmuch as, m the 
state of emancipation, it is void of all consciousness. A Yedantin 

does not hesitate to say STgfef ^fcf% and 

ftjpqcT | ‘ Being already Brahma, himself, it becomes Brahma 
himself’, and ‘Free already, it is freed.’ 



374 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


Again, the emancipation of the Yedantins is practi- 
cally like that of the Nyaya and others among the 
Systems. In these, as I have said before, emancipation 
is, to be delivered from all pain, and to remain like a 
stone, utterly void of intelligence. And in this there 
is no experience of happiness. Precisely snch is the 
condition of emancipation according to the Yedantifls, 
however it may seem, from their language, that it is 
attended by happiness ; for they describe Brahma as 
being intelligence and bliss. To be emancipated is, 
with them, realization of Brahmahood ; and from this 
it should seem, that the emancipated must be happy. 
I have shown, however, that their Brahma is only 
nominally intelligence and bliss. He is intelligence 
that cognizes nothing, and bliss without fruition of 
happiness. What hope is there, that the soul would 
be happy, if it came to such a state as this? 

We know, that all their doctrines concerning Brahma 
and the soul are most absurd; but, accepting them as 
set forth, we can even show, that their emancipation 
amounts to annihilation. They say, that the soul is 
false. If so, it can never actually be restored to 
Brahmahood. Eor a false thing cannot become true. 
So long as misapprehension endures, such a thing 
exists as a semblance; and, when right apprehension 
accedes, it vanishes away. To disappear into nothing- 
ness is, then, all that the hapless soul could attain to 
by acquiring right apprehension. 

Hitherto I have been taken up with the leading 
doctrines of the Yedanta ; and I have passed by nothing 
of main import. And now I venture to ask any 
thoughtful man, whether this scheme deserves to be 



THE VEDANTA NOT THEISTIC 


875 


called theistic, Viewed superficially, it has, I allow, 
a guise of theism ; and yet, when investigated critically, 

I cannot see, that it is anything but a sort of atheism. 

The distinctive article of theism is, the belief in a 
God: but God is eliminated from the Vedanta. Its 
Brahma is neither creator of the world, nor its 
preserver, nor its lord ; in short, the world is out of 
relation to him. Let the Vedantins give to such an 
object the title of Brahma, or that of Supreme Spirit; 
still their doing so does not make them theists. 
Greatness does not consist in bearing a great name ; 
but he that does mighty deeds, and is endowed with 
extraordinary excellences, is great, and he alone. 
Why is God spoken of as supremely great *> Because 
He created all, and regulates and governs all, and 
because^ He is omnipotent and omniscient, and endowed 
with divine attributes. Again, why is it proper for us, 
and incumbent on us, to honour and to love Him? 
Because He made us, and because we are His, and 
because He is our benefactor, and because, by reason 
of His adorable perfections, He claims the homage of 
our hearts. The religion which does not recognize m 
the Supreme the characteristics thus enumerated, does 
not really recognize God ; and the worship which it 
teaches is not the worship of God. To devise a strange 
imagination, and to denominate it Brahma and Supreme 
Spirit, will in nowise benefit the Vedantins. 

Moreover, as, to a theistic religion, God and the 
adoration of Him are essential, so likewise is discrimi- 
nation between sin and virtue ; and this discrimina- 
tion is ignored by the Vedanta. Sin and virtue are 
acknowledged, indeed, from the standing point of 



376 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

practical existence , but, nevertheless, they come to be-, 
in truth, nothing. The ignorant man, consistently 
with these views, may dread sin, and follow after 
virtue ; but the rightly apprehending man should spurn 
at both. 1 He has no reason to fear the one, nor any 
motive for pursuing the other. Wherein, on this 
score, does the Vedanta differ from atheism ? Aifd 
can any one hope to be advantaged by such a belief ? 

The Vedantin would fain make out, by his sophistical 
arguments, that Isvara, the world, and so forth are 
what he calls false. But for all that, he is unable to 
rid himself entirely of the conviction of their self- 
evident and undeniable realness. Hence, as I have 
said, they present themselves to him as verities. To 
do away with the incongruity involved herein, the 
Vedantins have set up their theory of various sorts 
of existence. The objects above mentioned, Isvara, etc., 
which show themselves as real, they allege to belong 
to the practical, not to the true ; and so, by fallacies, 
they solace their mental disquietude. 

My view, that the Vedanta does not merit a place 
among theistic religions, is based on a sifting of its 

1 f at q feqa i 

?ar$.fq g sjri gfr^ q q Iqqaja 11 

‘He who has not the notion, that he is a doer, and whose 
intellect is not involved by ioorks , though he were to slay all 
these denizens of eatth, would not, in fact , slay, or be 
compromised.’ 

So runs the Bhagavad-gUd , xvih. 17. 

This is a perfectly legitimate deduction from Vedanta 
premises 



THE VEDANTA NOT THEISTIC 377 

^leading and fundamental tenets. Its advocates, of 
course, here take issue with me. According to them, 
their system countenances the worship of God, and 
■distinguishes between sm and virtue, etc., etc. ; and 
such is their inconsistency, that they teach conform- 
ably. The harm they do is, therefore, less than 
faould be done by inculcating overt atheism. Still, 
any scheme must be most pernicious which is, in 
truth, repugnant to theism, even though its maintain- 
ers do not clearly perceive such repugnance. Those 
Vedantins, I have observed, who are naturally least 
inclined to evil, are least injured by their system. 
But its effect on those persons who have a strong 
bias to vice, is, I have likewise observed, such, that 
no excess of wickedness seems to them wrong. As 
for the former class, it is, I think, owing to their 
addiction to devotional exercises, rather than to matters 
of doctrine, that they are not equally depraved. But 
let a man give himself up to the Vedanta, and dwell 
constantly on such thoughts as that he is Brahma, 
and pure, and that sin and virtue are falsities ; be his 
natural disposition however favourable, his reverence 
for God must become less, and his desire to discrimi- 
nate good and evil must grow cold and languid. And 
the detection of his sins, and humility and grief 
because of them, how can these and such like, which 
are most necessary and beneficial to man, be possible 
to him ? Indeed, it is unavoidable but that the Vedanta 
should work only prejudice to all whom it influences 
in a lesser degree, certainly, to some than to others : 
but it cannot improve the fallen nature of any single 
mortal. 



378 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 

Reason admonishes ns, that the true religion is that, 
which meliorates onr natural condition ; which, surely, 
with every one of us, stands in great need of amend- 
ment. The best of men must be, in the eyes of God, 
grievously imperfect and sinful. Even they require the 
remedy of the true Faith. Moreover, no man can 
love God as he ought. One proof of due love to God 
is, the avoidance of all sin of whatever description ; 
for sin is that which is opposed to the divine com- 
mands, and abhorrent to God. Yet there is no one 
who has not committed sins innumerable ; and the 
natural man has turned from God, and is on the 
way to perdition. He wants, then, a religion to in- 
struct him in the knowledge of God, and to lead 
him to worship and honour Him ; and to show the 
exceeding heinousness of sin, and its terrible conse- 
quences, and how, by repentance and prayer, to free 
himself from its fetters. That religion from which 
we learn these things must be, we feel, from God. 
And, for philosophers — themselves corrupt, as being 
human — to exhort their fellow-men, in contrariety to 
the teachings of that religion, to regard God as false, 
to think themselves one with Brahma, and to count 
sin, and virtue, and their fruits, nonentities, is to 
administer to a sick man poison, not medicine. Cease, 
I entreat you, my beloved countrymen, to consider 
as true a religion which contains such things as 
these. 

I shall conclude with a few words on the faculty 
of judgement. God has given this to mankind in 
general; and, by reason of it, men believe, that there 
is a God, maker of the world ; and they know, that 



THE VEDANTA NOT THEISTIC 


379 


► it is good to practise virtue, and wrong to do evil, 
and what is the fruit of each ; and that they should 
worship God, and secure His favour, and that from 
His favour springs true happiness. In most cases,, 
such is its force, that, when a man sins, he at once 
condemns himself for his sin But, now that man 
iias lapsed from his original condition, his judgement 
is not so perfect, or so sure, as it was at the beginning 
of the world As concerns things of a primary 
character, it speaks the same language to almost all *, 
but, immediately on arriving at particulars, we mark 
a great discrepancy. Hence the origin of so many 
religions and sects. And the judgement of a man who 
accepts a false religion becomes more depraved than 
it would be otherwise. Nevertheless, let a man’s 
religion be ever so far from the truth, and let his 
reason be ever so perverted by the lessons he has 
heard from his }outh up, there are certain things in 
respect of which that man’s better judgement will belie 
his doctrines. Thus is it with the Vedantins. There 
is no doubt, that the fundamental dogmas of the 
Vedanta are opposed to all godliness, and are sub- 
versive of the principles of morality. It is perfectly 
certain, that, according to them, one is not called 
upon to fear and to adore God, to detest sin, and to 
love virtue. Inconsistently enough, however, there 
are Vedantins who are earnestly devoted to the worship 
of what they take to be God. This comes from their 
following the dictates of their better judgement, the 
voice of God, rather than their own chief tenets. 
For the same reason it is, that, in the opinion of the 
Vedantins, even he who has acquired what they calL 



380 THE HINDU PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEMS 


right apprehension is not to do as he lists, but must" 
eschew vice. In several other particulars, too, the 
Vedantins are seen to follow common sense, in contra- 
vention of their system. For instance, since they 
profess to regard the soul and the Supreme Spirit as 
one, why should they hesitate to allow, that the latter 
is changeable and impure? But not only do they 
hesitate here, but they refuse to admit, that the 
Supreme Spirit is other than ever pure, intelligent, 
and free. To seem to reconcile this position with 
the rest of their scheme, costs them great labour. 
Powerful indeed must be the natural instinct of truth, 
if, in spite of the causes tending to debilitate it, which 
I have lately spoken of, it still asserts its prerogative, 
with some effect, among very misbelievers. Even 
through their mouths it bears witness against false 
doctrine, and in behalf of God and the truth. 

God be praised, that He has suffered us to retain 
thus much of this illumination; it being this alone 
that serves as a safeguard and moral guide to such 
men as are ignorant of the true religion. Except 
for it, no one can tell to what depth the human race 
would not have become degraded ; so surcharged are 
false religions with error, so far do they militate 
against the majesty and purity of God, and so 
confused and imperfect are their principles of right 
and wrong. The reason, as we now find it, is, how- 
ever, inadequate to lead us to the way of salvation, 
or to purify our corrupt nature. For these ends we 
must have recourse to the word of God. And, as 
regards this word, when presented, the reason, once 
more, is of great use, in enabling us to test it, and 



THE YEDANTA NOT THEISTIQ 381 

to recognize it for what it professes to be. Moreover, 
such is the efficacy of the word of God, that, as an 
inquirer goes on studying it, provided he brings to 
that study due perseverance, impartiality, humbleness, 
and abnegation of self, his judgement daily becomes 
more and more defecated ; and it enables him to 
3istinguish clearly between what is true and what is 
false in matters of religious belief. But the result 
will not be thus, unless he applies himself to the 
search of Holy Writ in the way I have specified. For 
there are many truths which, though at the first 
blush they revolt the mind, are seen, after patient 
investigation, to be quite in accord with all that is 
reasonable and right. 

„The true religion is now accessible to the people of 
India. , May God, in His infinite mercy, grant, my 
dear countrymen, that you quench not the divine light 
which He has lighted in your breasts, that, on the 
contrary, you may follow its leading ; that you meekly 
and patiently try, by it, the Christian Scriptures ; 
that you take hold on their priceless promises ; and 
that, in the end, you may inherit, as your everlasting 
portion, the joy of the Heavenly Kingdom.
