## LXX

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

19 WEST 38TH STREET  
NEW YORK

*9th August '95*

DEAR MOTHER —

Your note duly received. I saw also Miss Thursby yesterday. After the
*hard work* at the Thousand Islands, I am taking a few days quiet and
preparation for my departure. So I cannot come to Greenacre. I am with
Miss Phillips and will be till the 17th, on which day I depart for
Europe. I have seen Mr. Leggett. You remember Mrs. Sturges, the widow in
black in my classes. She is going to marry Mr. Leggett in Paris. They
will be married the 1st week we arrive, and then they go on a tour
through Europe, and I, to England. I hope to return in a few weeks —
back to New York.

Kindly give to Miss Hamlin \[Elizabeth L. Hamlen\], to Miss \[Sarah\]
Farmer, Dr. \[L. L. Wight\] and Miss Howe, and all our friends my
greetings, love and good-bye.

Ever sincerely your Son,  
VIVEKANANDA
