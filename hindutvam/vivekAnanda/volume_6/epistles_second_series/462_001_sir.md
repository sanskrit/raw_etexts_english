(*Translated from [Bengali](b6001e6001.pdf)* [](b6001e6001.pdf) )

VRINDABAN,  
12th Aug., 1888.

DEAR SIR,

Leaving Ayodhya I have reached the holy Vrindaban, and am putting up at
Kâlâ Bâbu's Kunja. In the town the mind feels contracted. Places like
Râdhâ-kunda, I have heard, are delightful; but they are at some distance
from the town. I have a mind to proceed very shortly to Hardwar. In case
you have any acquaintance there, you would be doing me a great favour if
you would kindly write him an introduction for me. What about your
visiting this place? Please reply early and oblige. 

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#txt1)Letters i - iv, vi - xiv, xvi - xxii, xxiv - xxvi, xxix,
    xxxi - xxxiii and cxxiv are translated from Bengali letters written
    to Pramadadas Mitra of Varanasi, an orthodox Hindu, for whose
    profound erudition and piety Swamiji had the highest regard. These
    letters are most interesting being written (except the last) at a
    time when, after his Master's passing away, Swamiji was leading a
    wandering monk's life. In the early days he used to sign his name as
    Narendranath, though his now famous name, Vivekananda, is printed in
    all these pages for easy comprehension.
