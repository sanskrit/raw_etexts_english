title = "First grAhin remains"

+++
The first grAhin pursued us like the gandharva pursuing the bharadvAja
marked for destruction by the kAshyapa. It was spreading terror much
like that grAhin sent against us in the same context last year around
the same time. That one was killed with the haridra prayoga which was
like the sword of viShNu. But this one seated in the secret realm was
evading our prayoga despite having been targeted.
