title = "Descent to naraka"

+++
We had earlier narrated how we had spent time in svarga with the
apsaras. From there we descended to the himaparvatas- i.e for warm
weather souls like us the slopes of the pAshaNDaâ€™s hill. We continued
sporting there for sometime enjoying the brief bliss of our successes.
Then our ill fate brought us crashing to a low hollow in plane of
pR^ithivi. We thought we had hit the nadir of existence when we were
shaking from our thunderous crash to pR^ithivi. We did not know that the
narakas lay below. Then the noose of karma having caught us dragged us
to the lower realms and to our utter shock we lay in naraka. We felt
like king yuddhiShiThira in his final journey on the path to naraka. How
is it that we are in naraka? we asked, just as the great king had done.
Torments were seizing us from all sides. And there we saw our shachiva
and amAtya also being dragged away to a dark recess of naraka, they were
yelling and cursing but each one faces his torment in naraka on his own.
At this point all we could say is that why has our fate taken us to
naraka? But we found no answers.
