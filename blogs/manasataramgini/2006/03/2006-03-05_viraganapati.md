My mAtAshrI always draws or paints her own images for her sAdhanas. The
most striking of these which is used is the ashvAruDha vIragaNapati. It
was of course copied from the original work by a Maharatta artist which
was done for the student of the famed bhAskararAya makhIndra. When at
home I have always used this one for the rite of ugravinAyaka.
