title = "Dreaming of pleasures"

We sat in the train after a brief wait at the station. We received a
signal from indra. We opened our eyes from the spell of somnolence into
which we were lapsing. We saw two sets of vidyAdhara-s, like those
described by vAlmIki. Then our eyelids closed. We felt the thundering
indra rend apart the rodasi. The cosmic nature of maghavan and imagery
of his earth plays intermingled like waves interfering on a pellucid
pondâ€™s surface. We had a brief dream of pleasure, like an island in the
sea of sorrow.  
He sees not pleasure when he encounters vidyAdhara-s,  
he sees not sorrow when he encounters yakShiNI-s,  
but like the bow of the thunderer filling the atmosphere,  
the indra in his nerves props the rainbow of pleasure.

From the dream we emerged and found that we were back in the rough waves
of the sea of sorrow, with sharks seeking to make a meal of us. In our
house prowled the agents of dhUmAvatI and assorted vetAlas and
pishAchI-s, as though in a smashAna. Tormented by these we wandered.
Thus, we arrived at the mahAyuddhArNava.  
R^ikShabAhu and rasa-pishAchI attacked us, but the spell of AdyalakShmi
neutralized them;  
The speckle-skinned vidarbhan attacked us, but by the spell of skanda we
overcame him;  
The kShurika-mukhA attacked us, but by the spell of bhIma we slipped
past her;  
kAlAnana surApAyin, with madonmatta attacked us, but the spell of indra
blinded them;  
The bands of mlechCha-s fell upon us, but the thunderer saw us through
them, sending brahmins to fight in our ranks;  
But now we face the khANDavan-s, who have been moving like kumbhakarNa
against the vAnara-s. Which deva will come to our aid?
