(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 6, pp. 213-16. Cf. Ida Ansell's notes of "The
Gita III", *[Complete
Works](../../volume_1/lectures_and_discourses/the_gita_iii.htm)*, I.)

*\[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel's notes of the Bhagavad-Gitâ lecture delivered
Tuesday, May 29, 1900, in San Francisco, California\]*

1.  "If you know everything, disturb not the childlike faith of the
innocent."  
2.   "Religion is the realization of Spirit as Spirit. Not spirit as
matter."  
3.   "You are spirit. Realize yourselves as spirit. Do it any way you
can."  
4.  "Religion is a growth": each one must experience it himself.  
5.   "Everyone thinks 'my method is the best'. That is so, but it is the
best for you."  
6.   "Spirit must stand revealed as spirit."  
7.   "There never was a time when spirit could be identified with
matter."  
8.   "What is real in nature is the spirit."  
9.   "Action is in nature."  
10. "'In the beginning there was That Existence. He looked and
everything was created.'"  
11. "Everyone works according to his own nature."  
12. "You are not bound by law. That is in your nature. The mind is in
nature and is bound by law."  
13. "If you want to be religious, keep out of religious arguments."  
14. "Governments, societies, etc., are evils."  
"All societies are based on bad generalizations."  
"A law is that which cannot be broken."  
15. "Better never love, if that love makes us hate others."  
16. "The sign of death is weakness; the sign of life is strength."

*\[The following numbered paragraphs are correlated with the preceding
numbered sentences.\]*

4\.         The Christian believes that Jesus Christ died to save him.
With you it is belief in a doctrine, and this belief constitutes your
salvation. With us, doctrine has nothing whatever to do with salvation.
Each one may believe in whatever doctrine he likes or in no doctrine.
With us realization is religion, not doctrine. What difference does it
make to you whether Jesus Christ lived at a certain time? What has it to
do with you that Moses saw God in a burning bush? The fact that Moses
saw God in the burning bush does not constitute your seeing Him, does
it? If it does, then the fact that Moses ate is enough for you; you
ought to stop eating. One is just as sensible as the other. Records of
great spiritual men of the past do us no good whatever except that they
urge us onward to do the same, to experience religion ourselves.
Whatever Christ or Moses or anybody else did does not help us in the
least except to urge us on.

5\.         Each one has a special nature peculiar to himself which he
must follow and through which he will find his way to free dom. Your
teacher should be able to tell you what your particular path in nature
is and to put you in it. He should know by your face where you belong
and should be able to indicate it to you. We should never try to follow
another's path for that is his way, not yours. When that path is found,
you have nothing to do but fold your arms and the tide will carry you to
freedom. Therefore when you find it, never swerve from it. Your way is
the best for you, but that is no sign it is the best for another.

6.         The truly spiritual see spirit as spirit, not as matter.
Spirit as such can never become matter, though matter is spirit at a low
rate of vibration. It is spirit that makes nature move; it is the
Reality in nature, so action is in nature but not in the spirit. Spirit
is always the same, changeless, eternal. Spirit and matter are in
reality the same, but spirit, as such, never becomes matter, and matter,
as such, never becomes spirit. Matter, as such, never becomes spirit as
such, for it is simply a mode of spirit, or spirit at a low rate of
vibration. You take food and it becomes mind, and mind in turn becomes
the body. Thus mind and body, spirit and matter are distinct though
either may give place to the other; but they are not to be identified.

8.         "What is real in nature is the Spirit." The spirit is the
life in all action in nature. It is the spirit that gives nature its
reality and power of action.

9.         "Action is in nature." "The spirit never acts. Why should
it?" It merely is, and that is sufficient. It is pure existence absolute
and has no need of action.

12.       All nature is bound by law, the law of its own action; and
this law can never be broken. If you could break a law of nature, all
nature would come to an end in an instant. There would be no more
nature. He who attains freedom breaks the law of nature and for him
nature fades away and has no more power over him. Each one will break
the law but once and forever and that will end his trouble with nature.
"You are not bound by law. That is in your nature. The mind is in nature
and is bound by law."

14.       The moment you form yourselves into an organization, you begin
to hate everybody outside of that organization. When you join an
organization you are putting bonds upon yourself, you are limiting your
own freedom. Why should you form your selves into an order having rules
and regulations, thus limiting every one as to his independent action?
If one breaks a law of an order or society he is hated by the rest. What
right has anyone to lay down rules and laws governing others? Such laws
are not laws at all. If it were a law it could not be broken. The fact
that these so-called laws are broken shows clearly they are not laws.
