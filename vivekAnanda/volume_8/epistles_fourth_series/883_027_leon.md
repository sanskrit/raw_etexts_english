## XXVII

*To Mr. Leon Landsberg*

HOTEL BELLEVUE,  
BOSTON,  
*13th September, 1894*.

DEAR LEON,

Forgive me, but I have the right, as your Guru, to advise you, and I
insist that you buy some clothes for yourself, *as the want of them
stands in the way of your doing anything in this country*. Once you have
a start, you may dress in whatever way you like. People do not object.

You need not thank me, for this is only a duty. According to Hindu law,
if a Guru dies, his disciple is his heir, and not even his son —
supposing him to have had one before becoming a Sannyasin. This is, you
see, an actual spiritual relationship, and none of your Yankee "tutor"
business!

With all blessings and prayers for your success, 

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.
