Now *this* is Woden’s Day devotional posting !

JAI SRI RUDRA !!!

***THE STORM WIND WELCOMES US HOME***

A rather excellent RigVedic Rudra hymnal follows, but before we get to
that .. a few points of interest to note therein:  
  
i) respect is absolutely paramount. There’s a line in here asking for
the Great God not to take offence if the supplicant has inadvertently
said the wrong thing. There’s also another in which the singer declares
that they Bow to Rudra “even as a boy before the sire who greets him.”
An excellent illustration – Which I mention because for some strange
reason some people remain curiously resistant to bowing before Gods.  
  
ii) now as for the reason *why* one must bow – well, one is asking for
aid, so it is only appropriate to do so with proper respect. Even before
we consider that this is a quite literally Terrific Deity of such power
that even the rest of the Gods are afraid of Him. It’s rather like
approaching an Emperor – not something to be done lightly or trivially –
and most definitely ‘at your own peril’ if done poorly or
insouciantly.  
  
iii) in terms of why make such an approach – despite what you may have
read elsewhere, Rudra is prayed to in order to ask for *positive* boons
– not merely to ask that His wrathful attentions be directed
*elsewhere*. We can see this here, wherein health and medicine are asked
for … as well as well as, to be sure, the Weaponry and the Wrath of
Rudra to be aimed at somebody other than the supplicant. But this is
also a plea for *protection* – as in, Rudra protects the person praying
in this way by smiting down enemies.  
  
It goes along with the asking of the Great God to look upon the
supplicant with “compassion”, and the mention of His Hand as “the hand
that giveth health and bringeth comfort”. And, given the times which we
are living in, the beseeching of Him for protection and availment
against disease. All of which help to present a more ‘positive’
perspective upon Him than what some would have you believe.  
  
I mention this because there is this incessant effort in various
quarters to paint Rudra as a Deity that is *only* asked – indeed,
\*begged – to leave us alone. And that is simply not true.  
  
This does not mean that Rudra is an easily ‘approachable’ deity – hence
the importance emphasized at various points in this Hymn of the proper
respect being shown … and the terrifying consequences of provoking His
Anger through heedless lack of concern.  
  
iv) Earlier, I suggested thinking of Rudra as an Emperor – indeed,
\*the\* Emperor – via way of explaining both the power and the respect
involved in such a prayer. The immense power called upon, the great
respect that ought be shown for same – and great gratitude into the
bargain should the Blessing (asked for , or otherwise) be bestowed. That
notion of Rudra as God-Emperor is not an idle metaphor – other than
Shiva’s customary title of “Ishvara”, which means exactly that, we have
what Griffith renders as “Sovran of this world”. This is not incorrect,
although the actual Sanskrit – Isanadasya Bhuvanasya – is perhaps rather
grander in scale … think *Universe*. \[I should also point out that
‘Bhuvana’ can also occasionally mean ‘Mankind’ .. which would render
Isanadasya Bhuvanasya potentially also interprable as “The God-Emperor
of Mankind” , “Master of Mankind”\]  
  
v) One of the frequent symbols we find for the Sky Father – Dyaus Pitar
– is the Red Bull. Which is observed here about line 15, and goes with
an array of other scriptural evidence found in the Vedas to hail Rudra
as the Sky Father.  
  
vi) The word that is translated as “Thunder” in the third line, is
actually “Vajra” in the original Sanskrit. Now, I think that Jamison &
Brereton in the recent Oxford edition have made an error by merely
rendering it as “Mace” – as it is quite clearly meant to mean Thunder.
We have well-attested mention not only of the Sky Father wielding the
Thunder in various forms and ways … but also subsequent Shaivite and
Shakta traditions which identify the Spear-style armament(s) of the
Great God and Great Goddess with the Vajra. I highlight this, because
there is another persistent belief that *only* the Striker/Thunderer
deific can or should wield Thunder – which is quite patently not the
case.  
  
There is quite a lot more that I can and should say about this Hymnal …
but for now, we shall simply let it speak for itself.  
  
“Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly”, indeed!  
  
RigVeda Mandala II , Hymn 33 – Griffith Translation :  
  
“1. FATHER of Maruts, let thy bliss approach us: exclude us not from
looking on the sunlight. Gracious to our fleet courser be the Hero may
we transplant us, Rudra, in our children.  
2 With the most saving medicines which thou givest, Rudra, may I attain
a hundred winters. Far from us banish enmity and hatred, and to all
quarters maladies and trouble.  
3 Chief of all born art thou in glory, Rudra, armed with the thunder,
mightiest of the mighty. Transport us over trouble to well-being repel
thou from us all assaults of mischief.  
4 Let us not anger thee with worship, Rudra, ill praise, Strong God! or
mingled invocation. Do thou with strengthening balms incite our heroes:
I hear thee famed as best of all physicians.  
5 May I with praise-songs win that Rudra’s favour who is adored with
gifts and invocations. Ne’er may the tawny God, fair-checked, and
gracious, swifthearing, yield us to this evil purpose.  
6 The Strong, begirt by Maruts, hath refreshed me, with most
invigorating food, imploring. As he who finds a shade in fervent
sunlight may I, uninjured, win the bliss of Rudra.  
7 Where is that gracious hand of thine, O Rudra, the hand that giveth
health and bringeth comfort, Remover of the woe that Gods have sent us?
O Strong One, look thou on me with compassion.  
8 To him the strong, great, tawny, fair-complexioned, I utter forth a
mighty hymn of praises. We serve the brilliant God with adorations, we
glorify, the splendid name of Rudra.  
9 With firm limbs, multiform, the strong, the tawny adorns himself with
bright gold decorations: The strength of Godhead ne’er departs from
Rudra, him who is Sovran of this world, the mighty.  
10 Worthy, thou carriest thy bow and arrows, worthy, thy manyhued and
honoured necklace. Worthy, thou cuttest here each fiend to pieces: a
mightier than thou there is not, Rudra.  
11 Praise him the chariot-borne, the young, the famous, fierce, slaying
like a dread beast of the forest. O Rudra, praised, be gracious to the
singer. Let thy hosts spare us and smite down another.  
12 I bend to thee as thou approachest, Rudra, even as a boy before the
sire who greets him. I praise thee Bounteous Giver, Lord of heroes: give
medicines to us as thou art lauded.  
13 Of your pure medicines, O potent Maruts, those that are wholesomest
and health-bestowing, Those which our father Manu hath selected, I crave
from. Rudra for our gain and welfare.  
14 May Rudra’s missile turn aside and spare us, the great wrath of the
impetuous One avoid us. Turn, Bounteous God, thy strong bow from our
princes, and be thou gracious to our seed and offspring.  
15 O tawny Bull, thus showing forth thy nature, as neither to be wroth,
O God, nor slay us. Here, Rudra, listen to our invocation. Loud may we
speak, with heroes, in assembly.”  
  
ॐ नमः शिवाय
