## LX

*To Dr. Paul Carus*

C/O MISS DUTCHER  
THOUSAND ISLAND PARK  
N. Y.  
\[*June 1895*\]

DEAR DOCTOR,

I am in this place now and had to change some of my plans on account of
the Toronto Congress.

I am therefore not quite sure whether I will be able to come to Oak
Island Conference. It is very possible, however, that I will be able to
do so.

I also hope Mr. \[Charles Carroll\] Bonney will come. He is a noble,
noble soul — one who sincerely wishes the fellowship of all humanity.

Is it not true, Dr., that Mr. Bonney, as I have every reason to think,
originated the plan of the parliament of religions?

I will certainly try my best to come.

Thanking you very much for your kindness, I remain

Ever yours in the Lord of Compassion,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. Will you kindly inform me what lines of thought you want me to
take.

V.
