title = "The actions of the vairi-s"

+++
On the 8th of the month the vairi sent the little imp, a cheTaka, to
needle us. The cheTaka was repulsed and sent back. On 14th the cheTaka
reappeared and broke through the first line of defense and was repulsed.
On 15th the ari sent a powerful stambhana prayoga at us. We were
paralyzed by the prayoga and could not take any counter measures. Taking
advantage of this the cheTaka broke through and attacked us directly.
After a strong fight we finally repulsed the cheTaka. The next day the
ari sent the grAhin at us which seized at night after 9.30 PM. We were
shaken by the grAhin’s intense attack – we feared we might need to
deploy the indra-shakti. But like karNa we could use it only once, and
then we would be defenseless. So were concerned about using it. We again
deployed the “rudhira shara-s”. But even as were tackling the grAhin,
the cheTaka broke through our prime fort and came again to attack us. At
the beginning of the attack we felt we might be taken by both the
agents. But tryambaka rudra helped us to keep the grAhin at bay, while
we fought the cheTaka ourself. The cheTaka pierced us and flew away
after we drove it with our last reserves of strength. However, since our
fort had been breached we stood exposed to repeated cheTaka attacks. We
were wondering if we should raise our sruk and sruva to should launch a
counter-prayoga against vairi-s.
