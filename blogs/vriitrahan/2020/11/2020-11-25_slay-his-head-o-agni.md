There is an oft mentioned Rigvedic verse by folk that allegedly asks
Lord Agni to slay the head of the demon who eats the flesh of the cow,
memory serving right, I remember seeing it some years ago. The Griffith
or Müller translation. I came back to it some days ago, reading Sāyana-s
commentary on it.

यः पौरु॑षेयेण क्र॒विषा॑ सम॒ङ्क्ते यो अश्व्ये॑न प॒शुना॑ यातु॒धानः॑  
यो अ॒घ्न्याया॒ भर॑ति क्षी॒रम॑ग्ने॒ तेषां॑ शी॒र्षाणि॒ हर॒सापि॑ वृश्च

yaH- who, pauruṣeyeṇā – related to man, kraviṣā – corpse, samaṅkte –
smears, yo – who, aśvyena – by horse, paśunā – by beast\*, yātudhānaḥ –
demon, yo – who, aghnyāyāḥ – of the milch cow\*\*, bharati – carries,
kṣīram – thickened milk, agne – O Agni, teṣām – their, śīrṣāṇi – heads,
harasā – by flame, api – even, vṛśca – cut down,

“The demon who smears himself with the flesh of men, with the flesh of
horse, with the flesh of beast. Who carries away the thickened milk of
the milch cow, O Agni, cut down their heads by \[your\] flame”

footnote 1 – paśu means beast or animal, griffith translates it as
cattle or kine. sāyāna-s commentary doesn’t say cattle or kine. just
says anyena (by other animal).

footnote 2 – aghnya means that which is not to be killed, colloquially
meant for the milch cow or bull.

If we go by Sāyāna-s commentary, it might just mean the flesh of any
other beast. Not explicitly kine, although the injunction on protecting
the milk of the milch cow is clear.
