<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">The Immanence of God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Vedas are the oldest literary monument of the world. Even European scholars admit that the ¤¤Rgveda is at least 4,000 years old and that an older book does not exist in the libraries of the world. The ¤Rgveda tells us that darkness prevailed everywhere before the creation of this universe. In the midst of that darkness and even beyond it subsisted, all by Himself, one Glorious Being (God), consisting of nothing but intelligence <span class="char-style-override-5">(ज्ञानस्वरूप)</span> and having no origin other than Himself <span class="char-style-override-5">(स्वयम्भू)</span>. He evolved Himself out of the darkness and created the universe by dint of His Tapas, i.e., His knowledge-power <span class="char-style-override-5">(ज्ञानशक्ति)</span>. The ¤Rgveda says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तम आसीत्तमसा गूळहमग्रे-</p>
<p class="Shlok">ऽप्रकेतं सलिलं सर्वमा इदम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तुच्छ्येनाभ्यपिहितं यदासीत्</p>
<p class="Shlok">तपसस्तन्महिनाऽजायतैकम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VIII.7.17)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This very idea has been echoed by Lord Manu, who says that before its evolution this universe consisted of nothing but darkness. Everything was lying dormant, as it were. Out of that darkness arose that Intelligent <span class="char-style-override-5">(ज्ञानमय)</span>, Effulgent <span class="char-style-override-5">(प्रकाशमय)</span> Being, the Originator of Himself, who does not depend on any other power to reveal Himself and who subsists  forever in His own grandeur <span class="char-style-override-5">(स्वमहिमा)</span> and supports Himself on His own power. The veil of darkness was lifted as soon as He revealed Himself. The actual words of the Manusmr̥ti are quoted below—</p>
<p class="Shlok">आसीदिदं तमोभूतमप्रज्ञातमलक्षणम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अप्रतर्क्यमविज्ञेयं प्रसुप्तमिव सर्वत:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत: स्वयम्भूर्भगवानव्यक्तो व्यञ्जयन्निदम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">महाभूतादि वृत्तौजा: प्रादुरासीत्तमोनुद:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">योऽसावतीन्द्रियग्राह्य: सूक्ष्मोऽव्यक्त: सनातन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतमयोऽचिन्त्य: स एव स्वयमुद्‍बभौ॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(I.5—7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘(At the time of universal destruction) this universe had merged, as it were, in darkness. It was in a chaotic condition, indistinguishable, indefinable, inconceivable and incomprehensible: it was lying dormant, as it were. At the end of this period that Glorious Being, who is the originator of Himself, evolved this manifest universe, though Himself unmanifest, and, having thus, unfolded His creative energy, revealed Himself after lifting the veil of darkness. He who is beyond the ken of the senses, subtle, unmanifest, eternal and incogitable, nay, who is the very soul of all beings, thus, shone by Himself.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The ¤Rgveda further says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">हिरण्यगर्भ: समवर्तताग्रे</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">There is another śruti which runs as under:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">आत्मा वा इदमेक एवाग्र आसीत्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एकमेवाद्वितीयम्।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the Bhāgavata Purāṇa the Lord says:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अहमेवासमेवाग्रे नान्यद् यत् सदसत् परम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">पश्चादहं यदेतच्च योऽवशिष्येत सोऽस्म्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(II. 9.33)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘At the beginning of creation I alone subsisted, the one beyond the manifest and unmanifest, and nothing else. And it is I alone who survive the creation. This phenomenal world is nothing but Myself, and whatever remains after that is also Myself.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The following verses occur in the śiva Purāṇa—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एक एव तदा रुद्रो न द्वितीयोऽस्ति कश्चन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">संसृज्य विश्वं भुवनं गोप्तान्ते सञ्चुकोच स:॥</p>

<p class="Shlok">अचक्षुरपि य: पश्यत्यकर्णोऽपि शृणोति य:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वं वेत्ति न वेत्तास्य तमाहु: पुरुषं परम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘At that time it was Rudra alone who existed. It was that Protector of the Universe who first created it and in the end dissolved it. He has eyes all round, faces on all sides, and hands and feet in every direction. Lord Maheśvara is the sole Creator of the heaven and the earth; He is the undoubted origin and source of all deities. He sees without eyes and hears without ears. He knows all, though no one knows Him. He is known as the Supreme Being.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Bhāgavata further says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एकस्त्वमात्मा पुरुष: पुराण:</p>
<p class="Shlok">सत्य: स्वयंज्योतिरनन्त आद्य:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नित्योऽक्षरोऽजस्रसुखो निरञ्जन:</p>
<p class="Shlok">पूर्णोऽद्वयो मुक्त उपाधितोऽमृत:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(X.14.23)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘He alone is the Soul, the Eternal Being, real, self-luminous, infinite, the primordial cause of all, constant, imperishable, always happy, untainted by Māyā (illusion), self-sufficient, peerless, unqualified (absolute) and immortal.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This idea, which is common to the Vedas, the Smr̥tis and the Purāṇas, has been succinctly expressed by the immortal saint-poet Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa in the following verses—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ब्यापकु एकु ब्रह्म अबिनासी।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सत चेतन घन आनँद रासी॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">आदि अंत कोउ जासु न पावा।</p>

<p class="Shlok">असि सब भाँति अलौकिक करनी।</p>
<p class="Shlok">महिमा जासु जाइ नहिं बरनी॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Brahma (God) is one, all-pervading, imperishable, all-existent, a mass of spirituality and an embodiment of bliss; no one has been able to find out His beginning or end. Even the Vedas have sung in praise of Him according to their limited capacity. He walks without feet, hears without ears and performs various actions, even though devoid of hands. He relishes all flavours even without a palate, and is a master-orator even though He has got no tongue. He touches without a body, sees without eyes and smells everything without a nose. In this way all his activities are marvellous. How can one describe His greatness?’</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-2-1" xml:lang="en-US">But how are we to believe that<br/>such a God exists?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Vedas, which affirm the existence of such a God, also say that we cannot perceive Him with our eyes—</p>
<p class="Shlok">न संदृशे तिष्ठति रूपमस्य</p>
<p class="Shlok">न चक्षुषा पश्यति कश्चनैनम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञानप्रसादेन विशुद्धसत्त्व-</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्ततस्तु तं पश्यते निष्कलं ध्यायमान:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘True, no one can see Him with his eyes; but everyone of us can realise Him with the help of his purified intellect after purging his mind of all evil propensities.’ Accordingly, those who seek to have a vision of God with their mind’s eye (intellect) should cleanse their body and mind and purify their intellect, and then commence their search for God.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-2-2" xml:lang="en-US">What do we see?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From the day we are born in this world and till we leave this tabernacle of our body we see grand and wonderful sights which excite a great curiosity in our mind to know how they come into being and how again they disappear. We daily observe that the bright orb of the sun with its wreath of thousand rays appears in the Eastern horizon early in the morning and journeying through the heavens and transmitting light, heat and vitality to the whole world, disappears in the west in the evening. By mathematical calculation the astronomers have arrived at the conclusion that the sun is 9,28,30,000 miles away from the earth. What a wonder that from such a long distance the sun is able to bring light, heat and vitality to all the living beings inhabiting this globe! It sucks up the moisture of this earth during every season through its myriad rays, sends it up to the heavens, and then, transforming it into clouds, discharges it again over the earth and thereby revitalises the grass, the foliage, the trees and the corn, and infuses new life into all living beings. Astronomy tells us that there are countless millions of suns much larger than the one which we see, but which appear to us like tiny stars on account of their being remoter than the sun with which we are familiar. Every evening after sunset we see the spacious firmament on high spangled with numberless stars, planets, satellites and other heavenly bodies. The silvery moon with its cool and soothing rays careers through the sky from the east to the west like the sun, immersing the whole world in nectar, as it were, and making the nights appear golden. The bright lustre shed by the various heavenly bodies in dark nights and enveloping all the points of the compass appears so beautiful that one does not find adequate words to describe its charm. All these stars and planets are seen revolving in the sky in fixed orbits from day to day, month to month and year to year under immutable laws, as if strung together in a cord. It is evident that if the sun does not shine brightly in a particular summer we do not have good showers during the following rains. It is equally plain that if the rains fail we cannot have a good harvest of corn and fruits to feed ourselves with. Thus, we clearly see that it is the sun who provides us all with food in the shape of corn and fruits. Now, the question arises whether all this organisation is the work of some intelligent principle whose object it is to create and sustain all movable and immovable creatures, or is it the result of a fortuitous conjunction of particles of matter only? Has this most marvellous constellation of heavenly bodies (solar system, as it is called) sprung up under the law of gravitation, which attracts material objects towards one another as a matter of course, and has been revolving in the sky of its own accord from year to year and century to century, nay, from one cycle to another, or is it some intelligent principle which is responsible for bringing it into existence and setting it into motion? It is the latter hypothesis which appeals to our intellect. The Vedas also endorse the verdict of our reason. They declare that the sun and the moon, as also the heaven and the earth, were created by God:—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सूर्याचन्द्रमसौ धाता यथापूर्वमकल्पयत्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">दिवञ्च पृथिवीञ्चान्तरिक्षमथो स्व:॥</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-2-3" xml:lang="en-US">The Evolution of Life</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly, we observe that the evolution of the organic world also proclaims that the creator of this universe is God. This organic world is full of wonders. Mammals <span class="char-style-override-5">(जरायुज)</span> like the man, the lion, the elephant, the horse and the cow; hatched creatures <span class="char-style-override-5">(अण्डज)</span> like birds; lice and other insects bred by sweat <span class="char-style-override-5">(स्वेदज)</span> and refuse of body; and trees, etc., which spring out of the soil <span class="char-style-override-5">(उद्भिज्ज)—</span>the origin <span class="char-style-override-5">(उत्पत्ति),</span> shape <span class="char-style-override-5">(रचना)</span> and career <span class="char-style-override-5">(जीवन)</span> of all these are simply marvellous. When the male and female unite together in love, a very minute yet organic element of the male’s body makes its way into the uterus of the female, where it is joined with a similar element of the female’s body. This combination of the male and female elements is known as the Jīva (living organism).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Vedas say—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बालाग्रशतभागस्य शतधा कल्पितस्य च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">भागो जीव: स विज्ञेय: स चानन्त्याय कल्पते॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Divide the extreme end of a hair into hundred parts and take the hundredth part of one of these parts: then you can gauge the minuteness of a Jīva. This Jīva grows in the form of an organism from the moment of its conception. Students of medical science have been able to discover with the help of microscope that a single drop of our seminal fluid contains hundreds of thousands of living germs, and that only one of such germs finds its way into the uterus where it persists and grows to be a foetus. The organism of a female’s body is so constituted as to enable the Jīva from the time of conception onwards to draw its nourishment through something which is shaped like a pipe. As the foetus grows in size there forms round it inside the uterus a sort of membraneous bag, full of fluid, which protects the foetus from injury. Wherefrom does this minutest and subtlest substance, as nice as the ten-thousandth part of the point of a hair, derive the capacity to assume gradually the features, the complexion and the shape of its parents? What is the power which sustains it and helps its growth in the mother’s womb? How do you account for the strange phenomenon that milk begins to ooze from the mother’s breasts shortly before the child’s birth? What power is there which supports the numberless living creatures, including men, animals and birds, worms and insects, nay, even trees and plants, and provides them with nourishment in time? What is the power which enables the ant to ascend a steep wall during the daytime as well as at night? What power enables birds of every size, big and small, to soar high in the limitless expanse of the sky without any guide or support?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How are innumerable varieties of forms, such as males and females, human beings, cows, lions, elephants, birds and insects, created? How is it that only human beings are born of human beings, lions of lions, horses of horses, cows of cows, peacocks of peacocks, swans of swans, parrots of parrots and pigeons of pigeons, a true copy of their parents in every respect. From tiny seeds spring up numberless big and small trees, reared with the help of some unknown power, and serve the living creatures for many years with their foliage, flowers, juice, oil, bark and wood, nourish and feed them with hundreds and thousands of their rich, juicy and delicious fruits, breathe the air, suck the moisture and draw their nourishment from the earth and the atmosphere, and wave and dance majestically in the air.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In our attempt to discover the miraculous power which is managing this whole show we find our attention arrested by a residential building which we see before us. It is found to have a big entrance by which we can enter the house. It also contains a number of windows and ventilators at various points to admit air and light. The interior of the house has many huge pillars and arches. It is also provided with roofs and balconies to protect the inmates from the sun and showers. Every device has been employed to minister to the comfort of the inmates in every room and apartment. Drains have been constructed to allow water to flow out of the house. The house has been so designed as to prove comfortable to the inmates during every season. By seeing this house we can say that the builder of the house was a skilled architect who designed it in such a way as to provide every comfort to the inmates. Although we have not seen the architect who built the house, we feel certain that it was built by one who is either still alive or is no longer in this world, and that it is or was a clever and intelligent man. Now let us examine the machine of our body.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It has got a mouth by which we eat and drink, teeth and jaws with which we masticate our food and a passage in our throat, known as the alimentary canal, through which we pass the food on to the stomach. Adjoining this there is another passage by which we inhale and exhale. The stomach has got a separate compartment in which the food which we eat is stored and undergoes the process of digestion and assimilation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The food, when digested, is transformed into blood, which accumulates in the heart, and therefrom it is conveyed through the numerous arteries to all parts of the body and thereby sustains, invigorates, enlivens and rejuvenates the whole frame. The body has further been provided with an outlet for passing the superfluous element of the food, which is not necessary for the nourishment of the body, in the form of excreta and another canal, called urethra, for pumping out the redundant part of milk, water and other fluids that we take, which is not required for the nutrition of the body. We have also been provided with a pair of eyes to see, a pair of ears for hearing, a pair of nostrils to take smell, a pair each of arms and legs with which to work and walk along respectively, and a generative organ for procreation. We now ask whether this most wonderful mechanism has come into being merely as a result of concatenation of particles of matter or whether it has been moulded and fashioned by some architect similar to the one who built the house referred to above, though infinitely more skilful, intelligent and powerful than the latter.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-2-4" xml:lang="en-US">Miraculous Powers of Mind and Speech</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As we turn to our mind, while engaged in these thoughts, we find that our mind, too, is a wonderful specimen of divine skill. The diverse faculties of our mind, such as the cogitative faculty, the imaginative faculty, the reckoning faculty, the constructive faculty, the retentive power, the power of understanding and the penetrative faculty are all such as leave us in bewilderment. It is by exercising these faculties that so many books have been written, so many poems have been composed, so many sciences have been discovered, and so many inventions have been made and are still being made. Is it something less amazing? Our powers of speech and modulation of voice are also marvellous. We find this purposiveness working everywhere in this universe. Moreover, we do not find the beginning or end of this creation. The various limbs of the different species of living beings have been fashioned and assorted in such a symmetrical way that the whole creation appears full of charm. We thus see that ever since the beginning of creation some miraculous power has been at work in every clime and at every age, and that it will continue to work forever.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Our intellect forces upon us the conclusion that this purposive creation has a primordial <span class="char-style-override-5">(आदि)</span>, eternal <span class="char-style-override-5">(सनातन)</span>, unborn (<span class="char-style-override-5">अज</span>), imperishable <span class="char-style-override-5">(अविनाशी)</span>, and ubiquitous <span class="char-style-override-5">(जगद्व्यापक)</span> efficient cause, who is endowed with infinite power <span class="char-style-override-5">(अनन्तशक्तिसम्पन्न)</span> and is all-existent, all-intelligent and all-blissful <span class="char-style-override-5">(सत्-चित्-आनन्दस्वरूप).</span> That one indescribable power is called by thousands of names, such as ºśwara, Parameśwara, Parabrahma, Nārāyaṇa, Bhagavān, Vāsudeva, śiva, Rāma, Kr̥ṣṇa, Viṣṇu, Jehova, God, Khudā, Allāha, etc.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-2-5" xml:lang="en-US">There is only one God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Vedas say—</p>
<p class="Gadya">एकमेवाद्वितीयम्। एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति। एकं सन्तं बहुधा कल्पयन्ति।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘There is only one God, one without a second. That one is called by the wise by various names. Although He is one, people have different notions about Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Viṣṇusahasranāma and śivasahasranāma afford a striking illustration to this truth. Yudhiṣṭhira asked Grandfather Bhīṣma to name the deity who was one without a second, who was the greatest refuge of all living beings, and whose worship and eulogy brought everlasting happiness to man. To the above query Bhīṣma gave the following reply—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जगत्प्रभुं देवदेवमनन्तं पुरुषोत्तमम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्तुवन्नामसहस्रेण पुरुष: सततोत्थित:॥</p>
<p class="Uwach">****</p>

<p class="Shlok">दैवतं देवतानाञ्च भूतानां योऽव्यय: पिता॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That is to say, every morning, on quitting one’s bed, one should extol God Viṣṇu, who is the Lord of the whole universe, the Supreme Deity, the Eternal and Ideal Being <span class="char-style-override-5">(पुरुषोत्तम).</span> One who always eulogises Him who is the Supreme Lord and Ruler of the whole universe and who is all-pervading, unborn and imperishable, is rid of all troubles. He is the brightest of all effulgent beings and the most austere of all austere penances. He is the greatest of the great and the most hospitable refuge of all creatures. He is the purest of the pure, the most sacrosanct of all that is sacred, the most auspicious of all that is auspicious, the godliest of all gods and the undying father of all created beings. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above excerpts should suffice to show that the Viṣṇusahasranāma and śivasahasranāma and all other laudatory compilations of that type aver that one God and no other is the object of their praise. It therefore behoves us all to concentrate our minds on, and sing in praise of Him every morning and evening.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-2-6" xml:lang="en-US">Though one, He is called by three names</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This one God is known by the three names of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśa. The Viṣṇupurāṇa says:—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Hence it is a mistake to regard Brahmā, Viṣṇu and śiva as different from one another. They are the appellations of one and the same God.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The sage Pippalāyana gave the following answer—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O king! know that Ultimate Reality to be Nārāyaṇa who is responsible for the creation <span class="char-style-override-5">(सृजन),</span> maintenance <span class="char-style-override-5">(पालन)</span> and destruction <span class="char-style-override-5">(संहार)</span> of this universe, though Himself attributable to no cause; who persists, within as well as without, in all the three stages of dream <span class="char-style-override-5">(स्वप्न),</span> waking life <span class="char-style-override-5">(जागरण)</span> and sound sleep <span class="char-style-override-5">(सुषुप्ति)</span> and who  inspires and stirs the body along with its various sense-organs <span class="char-style-override-5">(इन्द्रिय),</span> the respiratory organs <span class="char-style-override-5">(प्राण)</span> and the heart <span class="char-style-override-5">(हृदय)</span> to their respective functions. Just as sparks cannot penetrate the fire, in the same way our mind, speech, eyes, intellect, respiratory organs and sense-organs are incapable of comprehending that Ultimate Principle; nay, they cannot even approach it, much less describe it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He was never born and shall never die; He does not grow, nor does He ever diminish in size; He is immune from changes like birth and death, but is only a witness of all changing conditions; He is present everywhere and at every time and shall ever remain so; He is imperishable and consists of knowledge and knowledge alone <span class="char-style-override-5">(ज्ञानमात्र).</span>Just as vitality <span class="char-style-override-5">(प्राण)</span> is one, although it functions differently through different organs (for instance, the eyes see, the ears hear and the nose smells, and so on), and thus appears differentiated, similarly, the  tmā (Spirit), though one, appears as differentiated, because of its manifesting itself through different bodies. God is present everywhere—in the whole creation—alike in mammals such as the human being, the cow, the horse, the elephant, the lion, the dog, the sheep, the goat, etc., in birds and other hatched creatures; in insects—bred by sweat and refuse of the body etc., and the vegetable world which springs up from the soil; in short, wherever there is vitality functioning in some form or another. That which is seen abiding in us as a constant witnessing factor even when all our senses lie dormant, nay, when even the ‘Ego’ as expressed by the words “I am” is merged for the time being, and which we recall to our mind, on our waking, by using such expressions as ‘We had a good sleep’, ‘We saw this dream’, and so on, is Brahma (God).”</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The virtues of harmlessness <span class="char-style-override-5">(अहिंसा),</span> truthfulness <span class="char-style-override-5">(सत्य),</span> and refraining from wrongful possession of a thing <span class="char-style-override-5">(अस्तेय),</span> the practice of which has been enjoined upon every human being and the neglect of which is sure to lead to one’s downfall, take their stand on the above doctrine. It is in pursuance of these tenets that the performance of the five great sacrifices <span class="char-style-override-5">(पंचमहायज्ञ)</span> has been enjoined upon us by the Vedas in atonement for the sin accruing from the unintentional taking of any life. Carnivorous animals, or such human beings as may be bent upon taking our life or that of any other innocent person or robbing him of his property or outraging his religious susceptibilities, those who assault us or invade our country or village, and those who practise incendiarism or administer poison to others have been characterised as outrageous persons <span class="char-style-override-5">(आततायी).</span> It has been made obligatory on us to kill such persons or creatures by way of self-defence, when necessary, with a view to protecting the person, property, faith or honour of a brother or sister of ours. It is, however, a sin to kill innocent and harmless creatures. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is in pursuance of the above doctrine that Hindus have from the Vedic period down to the present day maintained an attitude of sympathy towards all innocent creatures of the world. The cow is adored by the Hindus as a mother <span class="char-style-override-5">(लोकमाता)</span> in recognition of the fact that she supplies wholesome milk to the human race and benefits them in so many other ways. It is, therefore, specially incumbent on every human being to preserve this useful species. Even ordinarily it is forbidden <span class="char-style-override-5">(अकार्य)</span> according to the fundamental doctrine of the above religion to take the life of any innocent and harmless creature, to rob anyone of his or her life and property, to wrong anyone, or to practise fraud upon anyone. On the other hand, to render some service or to do some good turn to one’s fellow-beings, who are as susceptible to pleasure and pain as one’s own self, constitutes a creed which is true for all times and all climes.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is in consonance with the above fundamental doctrine that it has been enjoined upon the followers of the Vedic Religion to feed not only human beings but even birds, beasts and all other creatures through the ritual known as <span class="char-style-override-5">बलिवैश्वदेव,</span> as will be clear from the verses quoted below:—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘That is after performing other YajÛas (sacrifices) a householder should take some more food, as much as he may like to have, and, placing it on clean ground, offer it with a peaceful mind to all creatures with the following words—“May this food, which I have set apart on this occasion, serve to appease and gratify gods, human beings, animals, birds, Siddhas, Yakṣas, Nāgas and other beings, reptiles, evil spirits <span class="char-style-override-5">(प्रेत)</span> and genii <span class="char-style-override-5">(पिशाच),</span> trees, ants, insects, moths and other creatures, whoever may be starving in consequence of their past actions and may want food from me.

<p class="TEXT-English">The householder should then devoutly leave the food on the ground for the good of all creatures, as he is the mainstay of all. Again, in pursuance of the above doctrine, the followers of Sanātana Dharma, while performing the ritual known as Tarpaṇa everyday, appease not only their forefathers but the living beings of the whole universe, as will be evident from the following verses—</p>
<p class="Shlok">देवा: सुरास्तथा यक्षा नागा गन्धर्वराक्षसा:।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“The Devas, the Daityas, the Yakṣas, the Nāgas, the Gandharvas, the Rākṣasas, the Piśācas, the Guhyakas, the Siddhas, the Kuṣmāṇds, plants, birds, aquatic creatures, burrowing animals, creatures flying in the air, all may be appeased with the water offered by me. I offer this water with a view to alleviating the sufferings of those who are undergoing tortures in the various infernal regions. I offer this water to appease those who have been connected with me by ties of blood or not or those who may have borne kinship with me in any previous life or those who may be expecting an offering of water from me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The quantity of food that remains after allotting the share of crows and dogs is too inadequate to appease all other creatures <span class="char-style-override-5">(सर्वभूतेभ्य:).</span> Notwithstanding this, it has been made obligatory on every householder to perform this ritual <span class="char-style-override-5">(बलिवैश्वदेव)</span> because it symbolises the sacred and lofty idea that a human being stands in the relation of a brother to all his fellow-creatures, and further serves the high and laudable object of surcharging the atmosphere of the world with the idea of fellowship of all living beings under the fatherhood of God and nourishing the idea with the moisture of love like drops of tears.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One cannot adequately praise the catholicity of this faith, which will also be evident from the following benedictory verse coming from the pen of one of the foremost and universally adored exponents of this faith, the great seer Vedavyāsa, who personified in himself the golden maxim <span class="char-style-override-5">सर्वभूतहिते रत:</span> (One should always be devoted to doing good to others)—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, the life and soul of Sanātana Dharma, has extended a loving invitation to the whole human race in the following inspiring and reassuring words:—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Leaving all other creeds alone, take refuge in Me. I shall absolve thee from all sins. Do not worry.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord further says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु न मे द्वेष्योऽस्ति न प्रिय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये भजन्ति तु मां भक्त्या मयि ते तेषु चाप्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">अपि चेत्सुदुराचारो भजते मामनन्यभाक्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">साधुरेव स मन्तव्य: सम्यग्व्यवसितो हि स:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">क्षिप्रं भवति धर्मात्मा शश्वच्छान्तिं निगच्छति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कौन्तेय प्रति जानीहि न मे भक्त: प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">मां हि पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य येऽपि स्यु: पापयोनय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्त्रियो वैश्यास्तथा शूद्रास्तेऽपि यान्ति परां गतिम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I am the same for all living beings. I bear no ill-will against any, nor do I love anyone. Those who devoutly worship Me, abide in Me, and I abide in them. Even the worst sinner, who solely depends on Me, should be regarded as virtuous; he will in no time be transformed into a saint and is sure to attain abiding peace. O Arjuna! take it from Me that harm shall never befall him who is devoted to Me. O son of Kuntī! even the womanfolk, the Vaiśyas (those belonging to the trading class) and the śµµµµūdras (those belonging to the labouring class) will surely attain the highest position if they take refuge in Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Blessed are they who have been initiated into this sacred and philanthropic creed! My devout prayer is that, guided by this divine light, all religious-minded persons, after refining and solidifying their knowledge and replenishing the store of their vigour and zeal, may propagate the truths underlying this creed and convince the whole world that God is one and only one, that in His essence He is present not only in all human beings but in all other mammals, hatched creatures, insects bred by sweat, and plants that spring up from the soil—in other words, in human beings, beasts, birds and insects, moths, trees and plants alike, and that the best mode of worshipping Him is to feel the divine presence in all creatures, to be friendly with all and to wish all well. Let us all consolidate and propagate the divine energyby preaching the cult of universal love and diffusing this true knowledge. Let us drive ignorance out of this world, eliminate wrong and injustice and promote mutual goodwill, happiness and peace among men by preaching truthfulness, righteousness and compassion.<span></span></p>
