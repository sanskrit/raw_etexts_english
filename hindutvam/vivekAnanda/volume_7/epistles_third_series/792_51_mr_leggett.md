*17th April, 1900*.

MY DEAR MR. LEGGETT,

Herewith I send the executed Will to you. It has been executed as
desired by her, and of course, as usual, I am requesting you for the
trouble of taking charge of it.

You and yours have been so uniformly kind to me. But you know, dear
friend, it is human nature to ask for more favours (now that they have
come) where it gets from.

I am only a man, your child.

I am so sorry A\_\_ has made disturbances. He does that now and then, at
least used to. I do not venture to meddle, for fear of creating more
trouble. You know how to manage him best. By the time you receive this
letter, I will be off from San Francisco. Will you kindly send my Indian
mail C/o Mrs. Hale, 10 Aster Street, Chicago, and to Margot in the same
place? Margot writes very thankfully of your gift of a thousand dollars
for her school.

May all blessings ever follow you and yours for your uniform kindness to
me and mine, is the constant prayer of

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. I am so glad to learn that Mrs. Leggett has already recovered.

V.
