ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS 
( N# B. Errors in printing that oan be easily detected have been passed over ). 

Sec, 4 pp. 12-20 The DharmasMra of Gaulama. Mr. Batakrishna 
Ghose ( in I. H. Q. vol. Ill for 1927, p. 607 ff ) has an ex- 
haustive note on the mutual relations of Gautama, Baudha- 
yana and Apastamba. He holds that Gautama is not the 
oldest extant author, that Ap. and Gautama stand in the 
same relation as Manu and Yaj naval kya, that Baudhayana- 
dharmasutra is not older than Apastambadharmasutra, that 
the reference to the views of some in Gautama 15. 30 may 
easily be to Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 21. Some of the reasons on 
which he relies for these views have already been examined 
in the body of the work. That the extant sutra of Gautama 
has been in some places revised may be admitted ; but that 
Gautama as an author on dharma preceded Apastamba's 
work cannot be denied. There is nothing of chronological 
value so far as Gautama is concerned in Apastamba's re- 
jection of the view of Svetaketu that even a married man 
should continue Veda-study. That Apastamba says 
nothing about mixed castes is on a par with his silence as to 
niyoga and the secondary sons. Apastamba knew the lowest 
castes such as Candala and Paulkasa and Vaina ( Ap. Dh. 
S. II. 1. 2. 6 ). As to beef-eating allowed by Apastamba, 
vide p. 45 of text and Satapatha Brahmana ( S. B. E. vol. 
26 p. 11 where beef-eating is not allowed to a diksita ). 
Doctors of law were not agreed on many points of dharma 
and hence no certain chronological conclusion about indivi- 
dual authors can be drawn merely from their views on cer- 
tain points. It is not correct to say as Mr. Ghose does that 
Apastamba knows no fines for crimes. Apastamba does 
say that in case of dispute between litigants elders were to 
decide, that in case of doubt they were to decide by infer- 
ence or divine proof, that witnesses were to tell the truth 
and that if the witnesses were found to be false they were 
to be fined (II. 11. 29. 5-8 ). This shows that fines were 
not unheard of in Apastamba's days and if he omits a de- 
tailed statement the*reason must be sought for elsewhere

Sec. 14 The ArthtiMslm of Kiwtilyit. There is a perennial stream 
of articles and works inspired by the Arthasastra. Some of 
them that appeared after this work was sent to the 
press and some that had appeared before but had 
been omitted through oversight are noticed here. 
Dr. Stein has a note on the word c sururiga ' occur- 
ring in the Arthasastra and its connection with the Greek 
word 'syrinx ; (vide I. H. Q. vol. I. pp. 429-432) and holds 
that the Arthasastra must be later than the 2nd century b. c. 
The same scholar contributes a note on ' Pandyakavata ' 
occurring in the Arthasastra II. 11 (in I. If. Q. vol. IV p. 778) 
and concludes from comparison with Byhat-samhita and 
other works that the list of countries cannot be earlier than 
6th century a. d. 1 am glad to note that the veteran sqvanl 
Dr. Jolly (in 'Zeitsehrift ftir IndoJogieandlranistik' for 1927 
pp. 216-221 ) approves of my view that the original rjame 
was Kautilya and not Kautalya. In the Nidhanpur plate of 
Bhaskarvarman ( E. I. vol. 19 p. 245, at p. 248) doners of 
Kautilya-gotra arc mentioned. The verse in the second Act 
of the Malatimadhava of Bhavabhuti ( gqnfr frUffiq ^rfel^g^-

the name Kautilya and his teaching. Mr. E. H. Johnston 
contributes in the JRAS for 1929 pp. 77-102 an article 
on ' two studies in the Arthasastra of Kautilya/ wherein he 
examines the works of Asvaghosa, the Larikavatara and the 
Jatakamala and holds that the Arthasastra is noi much ear- 
lier than Asvaghosa and not later than 250 a. d. It is grati- 
fying to sec that from the untenable position of relegating 
the Arthasastra 10 the 3rd century a. d., western scholars 
arc receding to the first century of the Christian era. Prof. 
Bcnoy Kumar Sarkar contributes an appreciative and lengthy 
review of Dr. Meyer's work ' Das altindische Buch vom 
\Velt-&c ' in the Indian Historical Quarterly for 1928 pp. 
348-383. Dr. Meyer lias brought out another work c on 
Hindu Law-books and their relation with one another and 
with Kautilya' ( tiber das Wesen dcr altindischen Rechts- 
schriftcn &c. ). This work compels admiration for the 
author's patience and industry, but is seriously marred 
chroughout by wild generalisations, perverse and startling 
propositions unsupported by weighty evidence. He makes 
Gautama the latest of the Smrtis and Narada one of the 
earliest, places Narada several centuries before the Christian 
era, regards the compiler of the Yajriavalkyasmrti as a 
stupid brahmana. He is blissfully ignorant of the references 
to Gautama occurring in the Tantravartika, which I collect- 
ed in my paper on 'the Tantravartika and the dharmasastra 
literature ' Q JBBRAS vol. I new series for 1925 pp. 66-67 )• 
He propounds the absurd theory that the tkahmanas were 
people like gypsies roving about in bands without any 
morals or principles of conduct. I can agree with some 
of his conclusions, viz. the non-existence of a Manavadhar- 
masutra, the non-existence of a floating mass of verses on 
which authors of dharmasastra could draw. Mr. Batakrishna 
Ghosc submits Dr. Meyer's work to a scholarly and tren- 
chant criticism in 1. H. Q. for 1928 vol. IV. pp. 570-592. 
Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar has recently published in a book- 
form his lectures on 'some aspects of ancient Hindu polity.' 
Vide I. H. 0. vol. V (1929 ) p. 780 for an article on

Sect. 15 pp. 105-107 Vaikbdnasadharntapraina. Dr. Eggers recently

Sec. 34 pp. 170-175 Yajhavalkyasmrti. Dr. Hans Losch writes 
a monograph on ' Die Yajnavalkyasmrti un Beitrag zur 
Quellen-kunde des Indischen Rechts' ( Leipzig 1927 ). His 
conclusions may be briefly summarised as follows : ( 1 ) the 
text of Yajnavalkya that we have and that is commented 
upon is not the original, but is enlarged with interpolations 
such as Vinayakasanti and Grahasanti ( which arc borrowed 
from Agnipurana chap. 266 and 164 respectively by the 
compiler of Yaj. Smrti), the section on rajadharma (which is 
a versified copy of ideas contained in arthasastra literature ), 
verses 60-205 °f r ^e third chapter ( of Yaj. ) : ( II ) the 2nd 
book of Yaj. ( on vyavahara ) is a later addition correspond- 
ing to an older redaction of the Agnipurana ; ( III ) that the 
first and 3rd books of Yaj. are a recast of an ancient text 
which has been better preserved in the Garudapurana. 
I have shown in my history of Sanskrit Poetics that the 
Agnipurana was compiled about 900 a. d. and in this book 
it has been shown that'the Garudapurana must have been 
compiled about the same time, that it summarises Parasara- 
smni and that it presents a text of Yaj. which is interme- 
diate between that of Visvarupa and that of the Mitak§ara. 
Dr. Locsh's work adduces no proofs that would shake 
these conclusions. I am pleased to find that Mr. CJiinta- 
harana Ghakravarti holds ( JASB for 1928 vol. 24 p. 467 ) 
that the nlti portion of Garudapurana belongs to th<j 9th 
or 10th century. The indefatigable scholar Dr. Meyer 
appears to have criticized Dr. Losch in a monograph (< vide 
review of it by Mr. Batakrishna Ghose in I. H. Q. for 
1929 pp. 367-375 ). Mr. Batakrishna Ghose hokU that 
vyavahara did not originally form part of the Yajnavalkya 



Additions and Corrections iz 

smrti on the ground that otherwise it is very difficult to 
explain its absence in the Garudapurana. But this is quite 
unconvincing. We have no sure criterion for judging on 
what bases the eclectic puranas ( Agnipur&na and Garuda- 
purana ) proceeded. But in the case of the Garudapurana 
the omission of the vyavahara section is easily explicable in 
several ways. The Garudapurana was concerned more 
with purely religious matters and so omitted the rather 
secular chapter on vyavahara. One might ask, why did 
the Agnipurana omit the first and third kandas of Yajna- 
valkya if they existed in its day. One may with equal logic 
argue that those two kandas did not exist in the Yajnavalkya 
smrti when the Agnipurana was compiled. 

P. 181 The late Sir Ramakrishna Bhandarkar outdid even 
Western scholars in assigning Yajnavalkya to a date not earlier 
than the 6th century a. d. In his work 'Vaishnavism and 
Saivism' (p. 148 ) the learned doyen of modern Sanskrit 
studies in Western India holds that the worship of Ganesa 
is a late one, as it is not mentioned in the Gupta inscrip- 
tions. The veteran scholar did not notice the points 
brought out in my book ( such as the mention of naksatras 
from Krttika ). He is willing to assign Amarasimha to the 
5th or 6th century a. d. ( ibid. p. 45 ). The great lexico- 
grapher mentions Vinayaka and his synonyms ( such as 
ekadanta &c ), but the words Mita, Sammita that are given 
as the appellations of Vinayaka in Yaj. are conspicuous by 
their absence in Amara's lexicon. Hence the conclusion is 
that Amara wrote centuries after Yajnavalkya and that 
Vinayaka worship had taken a complexion before Amara 
flourished that was very different from what it was in Yajn- 
avalkya's day. 

Mita and Sammita occur as names of Maruts in the Taitti- 
riya Samhita.

Sec. 38 pp. 213-221 Kdtydyana. Mr. Narayana Chandra 
Bandopadhyaya has recently published (Calcutta 1927) 
about 800 verses of Katyayana on vyavahara culled from 
five nibandhas. In the Hindu Law Quarterly recently 
started in Bombay I am editing a reconstruction of 
Katyayana on vyavahara ( reconstructed text from twenty 
nibandhass, references to the places whence verses are taken, 
translation, notes &c). About 300 verses have been printed 
in the first two issues for January and April 1930. 

Sec. 38 p. 215 read c Manu' for Bhrgu' in 1. 11. 

Sec. 39 pp. 221-223 Angiras. In the 2nd Act of the Malatimadhava 
(p. 104 of Bhandarkar's edition ) wc have a prose quotation 

from Angiras WIcWiqwitOpfMl *TOTT OT«*Sjfft^sr*fT**n^T%-

name as the view of some V§5ft^^<Firm^niSTO^<T I 

WM^fl^riV^^k '- It is not likely that Bhavabhuti who 
was a great scholar would commit a mistake and it is extre- 
mely probable that he had a sutra of Angiras before him. 

Sec. 44 pp. 226-227 Pitamaha. Dr. Karl Scriba collected together 
from several nibandhas about 200 verses of Pitamaha and 
published them with translation ( Die Fragmentc des Pita- 
maha, Leipzig, 1902 ) on the eight constituents of karana 
( i. e. the court of justice ), fifty chalas, twenty-two wrongs 
(in which king acted suo motu ), ordeals (162 verses ) and 
the four kinds of ascetics. 

Sec. 64 pp. 275-279 Dh&reivara Bhojadeva. In the Madras Tri. 
Cat. of Sanskrit Mss. for 1919-1922 p. 4562 No 3078 there 
is a ms of Bhujabalanibandha by Bhojaraja in 18 chapters 
on astrological matters in relation to vratas, marriage &c. 

In the Krtyaratnakara of Candesvara quotations from a 
Krtyasamuccaya of Bhupala or Bhupalasamuccaya are cited 
( at pp. 278, 289, 449, 461, 496 &c). It appears that this 
is entirely a different work from the Rajamartanda and 
the Bhujabalabhlma.

Sec. 71. pp. 294-296 Kamadhenu. That Bhoja was not the author 
of the Kamadhenu follows from the following words of the 

g xHH i *M ("p. 156 ) 'irmfa qwift ara^onpft^mmihw- 
^rr^m^ ^ { ^im^^m^h, foft w ifl -' At p. 30 of the 
same work the q&m$g is spoken of as equal in authority 
to the Raja ( TOFffprata$?r ). These references show that 
the Kamadhenu was not regarded by Candesvara as the work 
of Bhupala ( or Bhojadeva ) ; other passages of the Krtya- 
ratnakara where Gopala, Kalpataru, and Bhupila are spoken 
of in the same breath indicate that Gopala was as great an 
authority as the Kalpataru ; and knowing as we do that 
Candesvara looked upon Kamadhenu, Kalpataru, Parijata, 
Prakasa and Halayudha as his best authorities, it follows 
that Gopala was the author of the Kamadhenu. Vide 
3>aT*?5THJT pp. 277, 443 ( Mh l d^ l tffr^dVl l tWU 5). 

Sec. 72 pp. 298-299 Halayudha. There is a Ms. of a work called 
Panditasarvasva in the Madars Tri. cat. of Sanskrit mss. 
for 1919-22 p. 5165. In the manuscript itself there is no 
reference to the author or his parentage. It is a large 
work and deals with ^ufonTPBrnr, t^snWSjfa^niT. WlRT.wWt 

smnl, %* ? awprfNrrc, ST%. From the style it seems 
more likely that it is not the work of Halayudha. 

In the Ekadasitattva (Jivananda vol. II p. 51) and Suddhi- 
tattva ( Jivananda vol II p. 327) Halayudha is said to be 
the author of Sariivatsarapradipa. 

Sec. 73 pp. 301-306 Bbavadevabhatta. 

There was another work of Bhavadevabhatta called Sam- 
bandha-viveka. This work is mentioned in the Samskara- 
tattva ( Jivananda vol I p. 890 ) and in the Vivahatattva 
( vol. II p. 143 ). 

Sec. 74 pp. 306-308 PrakdSa. 

The Vivadaratnakara and other Ratnakaras of Candesvara 
generally refer to Prakasa only, but sometimes Candesvara 
speaks of Smrtimaharnavaprakasa e. g. on p. 326 of 
Krtyaratnakara we have c ^\*\m<W^W\WViW\\\f^\fb '

Sec. 87 pp. 354-359 Hemadri. 

In the Marathi Quarterly of the Bharata-itihasa-samsodhaka- 
mandala, vol. X part 2 p. 84, Mr. Y. K. Deshpande quotes 
from a work called Bhanuvijaya of the Mahanubhava sect 
passages wherein Hemadri is charged with having been 
won over by Turks ( Mahomedans ) and with having 
brought about the imprisonment of Bhanubhatfa alias 
Bhaskara Kavisvara Vyasa ( a Mahanubhava saint ) 'zfa *<m

But in the absence of other corroborative evidence hardly 
any reliance can be placed on this charge, as it might have 
been levelled at Hemadri in revenge for his imprisoning a 
leader of a dissenting sect like that of the Mahanubhfivas.

SYNOPSIS OF CONTENTS 

Sec. i Meaning ofdharma : ... pp. 1-4 

Defies exact rendering in English - In the Rgveda, used as ad- 
jective or noun - means c upholder or supporter* in some Rgvedic 
passages - in most Rgveda passages means c religious ordinances or 
rites ' and in rare cases c fixed principles or rules of conduct ' — in 
Aitareya-brahmana dharma means * whole body of religious duties- 
in Chandogya-Upanisad dharma means 'peculiar duties of asramas-' 
dharma came to mean c duties and privileges of a person as a mem- 
ber of the Aryan community, as member of one of the varnas or as 
in a particular stage of life ' - the same meaning in Taittiriya Upa- 
nisad (I. n ), Bhagavadgita, Manusmrti and other smrtis -according 
to Medhatithi, dharma five-fold viz., varnadharma, asramadharma, 
varnasramadharma, naimittikadharma, gunadharma - this meaning 
of dharma taken in this work - definitions of dharma according to 
Jaimini, Vaisesikasutra, Harita, Mahabharata and Buddhist works - 
subjects treated in this work, viz. sources of dharma, contents of 
works on dharma, their chronology. 

Sec. 2 Sources ofdharma : pp. 4-7 

According to Gautama, Apastamba, Vasisfha, Manu, Yajfia- 
valkya - principal sources were Veda, smrtis and custom - Vedas 
do not contain positive precepts on dharma, but give information 
incidentally - examples from Vedic literature suggesting dharmasastra 
rules. 

Sec. 3 When dharmaidstra works were first composed — pp. 8-10 

It is difficult to say when composed -Nirukta ( III. 4-5 ) exhibits 
controversies about inheritance and quotes a verse ( £loka ) from 
some work on dharma - Btihler's view about such verses - Gautama 
and Baudhayana speak of dharmasastra - Baudhayana and Apastamba 
mention numerous sages on dharma - Vartika of Katyayana and Jai- 
mini speak of dharmasastra - Patanjali on dharmasQtrakaras -dharma- 
sastra works existed prior to Yaska or at least before 600 b. c. and in 
2nd centniry b. c. dharmasutras had become authoritative - method 
of dealing 1 with the whole dharmasastra literature followed in thi?

book, first dharmasutras, then early metrical smrtis like those oi 
Manu and Yajnavalkya, later versified smrtis, then commentaries 
and digests, such as the Mitaksara - chronology of early writers very 
difficult to settle - Max Mtillcr's view that works in continuous 
Sloka metre followed sutra works not acceptable. 

Sec, 4 Dharmasutras : ••• pp. 10-12 

Many of them formed part of the Kalpa and were studied in 
distinct sutra-caranas - dharmasutras of Apastamba and Baudhayana 
presuppose grhysutras of their carana - no dharmasutras extant 
corresponding to the srauta and grhya sutras of Asvalayana, &ankha- 
yana and Manava-Tantravartika on what dharmasutra was studied 
in what particular Vedic Sakha - all dharmasutras gradually became 
authoritative in all schools - close connection between grhyasutras 
and dharmasutras on certain topics - scope of dharmasutras - grhya- 
sutras sometimes refer to dharmasutras - points of distinction be- 
tween dharmasutras and the other smrtis. 

Sec. $ Dharmasutra of Gautama : ••• pp. 12-20 

Gautama's is the oldest extant dharmasutra - specially studied 
by followers of Samaveda - Gautama one of the nine subdivisions of 
the Ranayaniya school of Samaveda - Gautamadharmasutra points 
to close connection with Samaveda - Gautama refers to his own 
previous dicta - contents of 28 chapters of Gautamadharmasutra - 
the work is entirely in prose - Gautama's language agrees more with 
Panini's rules than Apastamba's - explanation of this - Haradatta 
prefers Paninian readings of Gautama's text - some sutras of 
Gautama quoted in the Mitaksara and other works not found in 
extant text - extent of literature known to Gautama - the only 
author named is Manu - the meaning of 'acaryah* whose views are 
cited by Gautama - earliest reference to Gautama on dharma is in 
Baudhayana- dharmasutra - Baudhayana ( III. 10) borrows chap. 19 
of Gautama - close correspondence between many other sutras of 
Gautama and Baudhayana - Vasistha (4.34 and 36 ) refers to views 
of Gautama -Vasisfha's 22nd chap, is borrowed from 19th of 
Gautama - many sQrras the same in Gautama and Vasisfha - Gau- 
tama referred to by Manu as son of Utathya - Gautama referred to 
by Yajnavalkya, Bhavisyapurana, Rumania, Samkaracarya, Medha- 
titfoi - Gautapia's reference to Yavana - probable age between 600 -

Asahaya also did so - sloka - Gautama and Vjxldha - Gautama. 

Sec. 6 Baudhayana-dharmasntra : ... pp. 20-32 

Baudhayana is a teacher of the Black Yajurveda - arrangement 
of Baudhayana kalpa according to Dr. Burnell and Dr. Caland - 
Baudhayanagrhya presupposes the Baudhayanadharmasutra - grhya 
(III.9.6) speaks of pravacanakara Kanva Bodhayana and sutrakara Apa- 
stamba - tarpana in Baudhayana-dharmasutra ( II. 5. 27) mentions 
Kanva Bodhayana, Apastamba and Hiranyakesin - contents of 
Baudhayana-dharmasutra - extant sutra has not come down intact - 
fourth prasna probably an interpolation - third prasna also not free 
from doubt - Baudhayana 111. 10 taken from Gautama - Baudha- 
yana III. 6 agrees closely with Visnudharmasutra 48 - Dr. Jolly 
thinks both borrowed from a common source - probably Visnu 
borrows from Baudhayana - repetitions exist even in the first two 
prasnas - form and structure of Baudhayana - quotes numerous 
verses, even in the first two prasnas - language of Baudhayana often 
departs from Paninian standard - literature known to Baudha- 
yana - several authors on dharma together with their views mention- 
ed by Baudhayana - Asura Kapila said to be originator of asramas- 
£abara, Rumania, Visvarupa and Medhatithi refer to Baudhayana 
dharmasutra - home of Baudhayana - Baudhayana is styled prava- 
canakara and Apastamba sutrakara - Buhler holds that Baudhayana 
was a southern teacher - age of Baudhayana dharmasutra - later than 
Gautama - Buhler's reasons for placing Baudhayana a century or 
two earlier than Apastamba not convincing - divergences between 
Baudhayana and Apastamba - style of Baudhayana compared with 
that of Apastamba - Baudhayana to be placed between 500-200 B.o 
numerous sutras of Baudhayana identical with those of Apastamba 
and Vasisjha - Baudhayana mentions several appellations of Gancsa, 
just as Manavagrhya does and mentions seven planets, Rahu and 
Kctu - Govindasvamin commented on Baudhayana. 

Sec. 7 Dharmasutra of Apastamba: ... pp. 32-46 

The Apastambakalpasutra of the Black Yajurveda divided into 
30 prasnas, dharmasutra constituting 28th and 29th prasnas thereof - 
Apastamba is one of the five subdivisions of the Khandikeya school 
of Taituriyasakha - Apastambagrhya and dharma sutras are compoii- 



xri tRatow flf tiharmatostra 

tions of same author - some sutras of the two arc identical - Ap. 
grhya does not treat of some topics as they are dealt with in dharma 
sutra - contents of Ap. dharmasutra - form and structure of Ap. 
dharmasutra - Ap. is more archaic and un-Paninian than any other 
dharmasutra - many unfamiliar words in Ap. - several verses quoted 
in Ap. - literature known to Ap. - Ap. mentions six angas of Veda 
and ten writers on dharma by name - Svetaketu and Ap. - Harita 
quoted frequently by Ap. - Ap. controverts several views - striking 
coincidences between Gautama and Ap. - Ap. quotes a verse from 
Purana and speaks of the view of Bhavisyatpurana - Apastamba and 
Manu - Apastamba presupposes many rules of the Mimamsa and 
agrees closely with Jaimini's sutras - age of Ap. Dh. S. - quoted by 
Sahara, Kumarila, Samkaracarya, Visvarupa and Medhatithi - home 
and personal history of Apastamba not known - Ap. is later than 
Gautama and probably Baudhayana - his age between 600-300 b. c- 
Ap. condemns niyoga, rejects secondary sons, does not admit paisdea 
and Prajapatya forms of marriage - divergence between the views 
of Ap. and Gautama and other sutrakaras - Haradatta's is the only 
commentary extant on Ap. - Apastamba smrti in verse. 

Sec. 8. HiranyafoHdharmasntra : ... pp. 46-50 

Hirariyakesidharmasutra forms 26th and 27th prainas of the 
Hiranyakesikalpa-Hiranyakesin's can be hardly called an independent 
work, as it borrows hundreds of sutras word for word from Ap. - a 
few additions made to Ap. in Hiranyakesi Dh. S- - Hiranyakcsin's 
readings are smoother and more classical than Apastamba's - arrange- 
ment of sutras also is somewhat different in the two - com. of Maha- 
deva called Ujjvala on Hiranyakesin is almost the same as Haradatta's 
on Ap. - Buhler thinks Mahadeva borrows from Haradatta - 
Mahadeva's com. in a few places contains more matter than Hara- 
datta's and Mahadeva differs from Haradatta. 

Sec. 9 Vasirtha-dharmas&tra : ... pp< 50 .g 

Different editions of Vasisfha contain different numbers of 
chapters -Kumarila says it was specially studied by Rgvedins- ex- 
planation of this statement - nothing special in the Vasisthadharma- 
sutra to connect it with Rgveda - contents of the Vasisthkdharma- 
smra - style of Vas. Dh. S. resembles Gautama's - many sutras of 
* Vas. identical with Gautama and Baudhayana - form of 1 Vasijfha

dharmasutra resembles Baudhayana dharmasutra - Medhatithi and 
Mitaksara quote from almost all chapters of extant Vasistha and so 
does Visvarupa - literature known to Vasistha - Vasistha prohibits 
learning language of Mlecchas - authors on dharmasastra named by 
Vasijtha - Vasistha's references to the views of Manu are made with 
reference to a work of Manu almost identical with the present Manu- 
smjti and do not compel us to formulate the existence of a Manava- 
dharmasutra » Biihler wrong in taking Vas. Dh. S. 4. 8 as a quota- 
tion from Manavadharmasutra - Only Vas. Dh. S. 12.16 and 19. 37 
where Manu is quoted have no corresponding verses in the present 
Manusmrti - Over forty verses are entirely common to Vas. and 
present Manusmrti - conclusion that Vas. contains borrowings from 
the present Manusmrti or its prototype in verse - Vas. Dh. S. 22 is 
same as Gautama 19- Dr. Jolly's view that Vas. Dh. S. 28.10-15 
and 18-22 are borrowed from Visnudharmasutra chap- 56 and 87 
or its original the Kathakadhnrmasutra is wrong - home of Vas. to 
the north of Narmada, according to Biihler - this is mere specula- 
tion - earliest reference to Vasistha as a writer on dharma is in 
Manu (8-140)- age of Vasistha - Vasistha's views are ancient, 
praticularly about secondary sons, about Dattaka son, about niyoga 
and remarriage - he mentions only six forms of marriage • but in 
other matters differs from Gaut. or Baudh. viz. on adoption, on 
documents - Vas. Dh. S. between 300-100 b. c. - whether Vas. 
18. 4 (Ramaka v. 1. Romaka) contains a reference to the Romans 
- Vjrddha- Vasi§tha, an early compilation - there is a Brhad 
Vasistha and a Jyotir Vasistha - Yajnasvamin commented upon 
Vas. Dh. S. 

Sec. 10 Viwudharmasntra : ... pp. 60-70 

Visnu Dh. S. contains 100 chapters and yet sutra not extensive- 
several chap, ( 40, 42, 76 ) contain only one sutra and one verse - 
first chap, and last two are entirely in verse, the rest in mixed prose 
and verse - Visnu Dh. S. closely connected with Kathasakha - Dr. 
Jolly says chap. 21, 67, 73 and 86 of Visnu closely correspond with 
Kathaka grhya - but Visrtu Dh. S. is not the work of the 
author of Kathaka grhya - contents of Visnu Dh. S. - Visnu 
resembles Vas. Dh. S. - its peculiar feature that it. professes to be re- 
vealed by God Vijpu - its style, easy and diffuse - work contains old

and new material - hundreds of sutrasare prose renderings of hundreds 
of verses occurring in our Manu - hypothesis of a common origin 
or borrowing by both from a floating mass of verses untenable - 
exiant Visnudharmasutra borrows from Manu - Visnu contains 
verses identical with the Bhagavadgita and Yajnavaikya smrti - Dr. 
Jolly's view that Yajnavaikya borrows his anatomical section from 
Visnu not correct - Visnu Dh. S. contains long list of tirthas, the 
word Jaiva for Jupiter - those wanting in Yajnavaikya - extant 
Visnu Dh. S. later than Manusmrti and Yajnavalkyasmrti - Visva- 
nipa does not quote a single sutra of Visnu by name, though he 
refers to Visnu ( ch. 97 ) for orders of samnyasins - Mitaksara 
quotes hardly any verse from Visnu - Apararka and Smrticandrika 
quote Visnu profusely-verses were added at a late date to original 
sutra - literature known to Visnu Dh. S. - Visnu mentions the seven 
days of the week, recommends the practice of sati, speaks of pus- 
takas, of many good and evil omens 'among which the sight of 
yellow-robed Buddhist ascetics is included - it prohibits speech with 
Mlecchas and journeys to Mleccha countries, it dilates on worship 
of Vasudeva - though Visnu agrees income respects with Kathaka- 
grhya, on some points it differs from it - date of older kernel of 
Visnu may be 300 to 100 b.c. - additions made after 3rd century a.d. 
and before 7th century - some sutras agree closely with Narada - 
Brhad Visnu and Vrddha Visnu and Laghu Visnu - Nandapandita s 
com. on the Visnu Dh. S. - probably Bharuci also commented on it. 

Sec. 11 The dharmastltra oj H&rita : ... pp. 70-75 

Baudhayana, Apastamba and Vasistha quote Harita as an 
authority - Mr. Islampurkar secured a ms. of Harita-dharmasutia at 
Nasik in 30 chapters - contents of that ms. - its relation to Maitra- 
yaniyasariihita - it mentions r the Kasmirian word "Kaphella"-- 
quotations in commentaries and digests show that Harita dealt ex- 
haustively with the same topics that are found in other dharma- 
sutras - Kurnarila mentions Harita as dharmasastrakara but does not 
assign him to any particular carana as he does Apastamba and others- 
notable doctrines of Harita - mentions worship of Ganesa - Harlta's 
verses on vyavahara quoted in nibandhas are later than the sutra - 
Laghu Harita and Vrddha Harita - latter in verse is later than Yajna- 
vaikya, Narada and Katyayana.

Sec. 12 The dharmasutra of Safikha-Likhita : ... pp. 75-79 

From Tantravartika it appears that dharmasutra of Sankha- 
Likhita was studied by Vajasaneyins - Mahabharata ( Santi 23 ) 
contains story of brothers Saiikha and Likhita - Various compilations 
ascribed to Sankha alone or Likhita alone or to both - Restoration of 
Dharmasutra in Annals of Bhandarkar Institute ( vol. VII, VIII ) - 
Verse Sankhasmrti stricter than prose Saiikha -Likhita - com. on 
dharmasutra mentioned in Kalpataru and Vivadaratnakara - doctrines 
of dharmasutra similar to those of other dharmasutras - speaks of 
tM'elve secondary sons - allows niyoga - speaks of several ordeals - de- 
fines Aryavarta as between Sindhu - Sauvira and Kampilya - Litera- 
ture known to Saiikha Likhita - probable age between 300-100 b. c. 

Sec. 13 Manavadharmasutra : Did it exist ? ... pp. 79-85 

MaxMiiller and Weber responsible for the theory that the 
extant Manusmrti was a recast of an ancient Manavadharmasutra 
now lost - hardly any data for the sweeping generalisation of Max- 
Miiller that all genuine dharmasastras are nothing but more modern 
texts of earlier sutra works on hiladharma - one main plank of this 
theory that the continuous employment of the sloka metre was un- 
known in the sutra period is now exploded - Buhler supports Max 
Miiller's theory by some additional arguments - Vasistha IV. 5-8 on 
which Buhler relies not properly understood by him - Vasistha 
( 19-37 ) quotes a Manava sloka which is not in the Anustubh metre 
and not found in extant Manu and Buhler thinks it is taken from 
Manavadharmasutra - Btihler's reliance on a fragment of Usanas 
which is corrupt is not worth consideration - Biihler relies on 
Kamandakiyanitisara (II. 3. and XL 67 ) where Manavas are said to 
hold that there arc three vidyas for a king and that Manu said that 
king's council should consist of 12 ministers -These views not the 
same in extant Manu- Buhlcr's conclusion not correct - Kamandaka 
is only paraphrasing Kautiliya - Btihler's generalisation about 
Manava or Manavah without foundation - Kumarila, §arikara, and 
Visvarupa all employ 'Manava' for Manusmrti - Buhler relies on 
analogy of the complete set of Apastamba and Baudhayana sutras 
for holding that a Manavadharmasutra existed - Proper explanation of 
Vas. Db. S. IV. 5-8 Buhler not right in saying that Vas. Dh. S. 11. 
23, 12. ji 6, 23. 43 either contradict Manu or find no counterpart

therein - analogy of Apastamba sutras of no use - excepting the 
three caranas of the Black Yajurveda, no carana of any Veda has a 
dharmasutra attributed to the founder of that carana - an explanation 
suggested - existing materials not sufficient to establish theory that 
a Manavadharmasutra once existed. 

Sec. 14 Arthaiastra of Kautilya : ... pp. 85-104 

First translated by Dr. Shama Sastri and text published in 
1909 - other editions - numerous works and articles inspired by the 
publication of Kautiliya Arthasastra - Kautiliya is oldest extant 
work on Arthasastra - scope of arthasastra and relation to dharma- 
sastra - arthasastra an upaveda of Atharvaveda - purpose of this 
iastra - rule in case of conflict between Dharmasastra and Artha- 
sastra - Canakya, Kautilya and Visnugupta are names of the same 
person - glowing tribute paid to Canakya or Visnugupta by Kama- 
ndakiyanitisara, Tantrakhyayika, Dandin - Bana and Pancatantra on 
Kautilya as author of Arthasastra - Brhatkatha of Gunadhya contain- 
ed his story - Mudraraksasa connects his name with Kutila - contro- 
versy as to whether Kautiliya can be the work of a busy minister of 
Candragupta Maurya - Jolly, Winternitz and Keith hold that extant 
work is not by the minister of Gindragupta - Megasthenes' silence 
about Canakya explained - whether the Kautiliya is the product of 
a school or of an individual author - Kautilya's views cited about 70 
times in the work in the third person - explanation of this - Dr. 
Jolly wrong in his explanation of apadeia ( in XV. I ) - Keith thinks 
that an author would not parade an uncomplimentary epithet like 
Kautilya ( derived from kutila ) - Is the name Kautilya or Kautalya - 
works on gotra and pravara give various forms such as Kaufali, 
Kautilya and Kautili - form, style and contents of the Kautiliya - 
a few verses interspersed in the work, generally at the end - in all 
340 verses excluding mantras - some verses are certainly quotations - 
work abounds in numerous technical and rare words - deviations 
from Panini - summary of contents - section on judicial administra- 
tion interesting - greatest correspondence between Kautiliya and 
Yajnavalkya - some striking examples - it is. Yajnavalkya that 
borrows - reasons - Yajnavalkya represents a far too advanced stage

of juristic principles than Kautilya - close agreement between Manu 
smrti and Kautilya also - but they differ on niyoga, as to nomencla- 
ture of vyavaharapadas, about heirship of mother and paternal grand- 
mother, on remarriage of widows, divorce, gambling - Kautiliya 
long anterior to the extant Manusmrti - Kautilya's five references to 
Manavas explained - references to Svayambhuva and Pracetasa Manu 
contained in the Mahabharata suggest that there were two works 
in verse on dharma and politics attributed to these or perhaps 
one work containing both, subsequently recast as the extant 
Manusmrti - only two views ascribed to Manavas in Kautiliya not 
found in extant Manusmrti - in the dharmasthiya section the only 
other authors or schools cited are Barhaspatyas and Ausanasas - 
none of the dharmasutras of Gautama and others are anywhere 
quoted by name - views cited on the question as to whom a child 
belongs ( to the begetter or to him on whose wife it is begotten ) can 
be traced to Baudhayana, Gautama and Vasistha - views of Acaryas 
cited in the Kautiliya * Kautiliya later than Gautama and Apastamba 
but earlier than extant Manusmrti - date of Kautiliya - it is certainly 
not later than 2nd century a. d. and not earlier than 325 B. c. - schools 
named by Kautilya and also individual authors - views of Acaryas 
r are quoted over fifty times and Kautilya differs in each case - meaning 
of 'acaryas' - literature known to Kautilya - Sanskrit official language 
and the work mentions gunas of composition - Kautiliya agrees 
with Kamasutra in several respects - Dr. Jolly and Prof. Keith opine 
that both works composed about same time - points of difference bet- 
ween the two works - countries and peoples mentioned by Kautilya - 
silks from Cina and. blankets from Nepal - corporations of Licchavis, 
Vrjikas and others mentioned - meaning of 'raja&bdopajivinah* ( in 
XI-I ) - best breeds of horses - Mlecchas sold or pledged children - 
references to Buddhists and Ajivakas - weights to be made from 
stones/of Magadha and Mekala - doubtful whether Kautilya knew 
extant! text of Mahabharata - most of the stories cited as illustrations 
by Kautilya occur in the Mahabharata, but some divergence exists 
in the [case of Janamejaya, Mandavya - Kautilya's knowledge of drugs 
and of rasa ( mercury ) - references to shrines of Siva, Skanda &c-

Vaikhanasa is one of the six sutra caranas of the black Yajur- 
veda mentioned by Mahadeva in his Vaijayanti on Satyasadha 
frautasfitra - Vaikhanasa occurs in Gautama, Baudhayana, Vasistha 
(9. 10 ) and Manu (6. 21 ) - Vaikhanasadharmaprasna divided into 
three prasnas - contents of the work - its age later than Gautama and 
Baudhayana - names more mixed castes than even some of the verse 
smrtis - devotion to Narayana looms very large in the work - Dr. 
Caland's view that Manusmrti borrows from Vaikhanasagrhya not

MahabWarata ( §anti 59. 80-85 ) credits him with compression of 
vast wolrk of Brahma on trivarga and mentions several of his views- 
Kamasujtra speaks of Brhaspati as writer on artha - peculiar views of 



txU History of DharmatiMra 

Brhaspati according to Kautfliya - Brhaspati also wrote a prose work 
on vyavahara and prayascitta - probably the authors of the two are 
different - 700 verses on vyavahara ascribed to Brhaspati are quoted 
in the Mitaksara - this is an independent work composed between 
300-500 a. d. - smaller compilations in verse ascribed to Brhaspati - 
Barhaspatya Artha&stra edited by Dr. Thomas is a late work. 

Sec 27 Bharadvaja aid Bharadvaja : ... PP- 126-128 

A srautasutra and grhya of Bharadvaja exist - ViSvarupa's 
work establishes existence of a sutra work on dharma of Bharad- 
vaja - there was smrti in verse also attributed to Bharadvaja - Kauti- 
iiya shows that Bharadvaja was an ancient author on politics - some 
views of Bharadvaja - Mahabharata on Bharadvaja - verses on vyava- 
hara attributed to Bharadvaja - this probably different from work 
on politics. 

Sec. 28 Satatapa : ... pp. 128-129 

A sutra work of Satatapa on dharma dealing with prayascitta, 
&raddha and acara must have existed - verses of Satatapa quoted in 
Mitaksara and other later works - this is probably different from 
smrti work - several verse compilations ascribed to batatapa - Vrddha 
fcuatapa and Brhat Satatapa. 

Sec. 29 Sumantu: ... pp. ^129-1^1 

A sutra work on acara and prayakitta ascribed to Sumantu 
existed - Yajnavalkya and Parasara do not enumerate ijiumantu 
among expounders of dharma - Sumantu mentioned in Mah.abharata 
and Bhagavata- verses from Sumantu on dharma are cited by. Aparar- 
ka - this is a different work - numerous verses on vyavahara quoted 
from Sumantu in Sarasvativilasa. ! 

Sec. 30 The Smrtts : _ pp< 1x31-135 

Two senses of the word smrti, viz. all orthodox ancie'nt non- 
Vedic works ( such as Panini's grammar, Srauta sutras, Alalia bharata 
Manu, &c.) and (a narrower sense) dharmasastra - smrti, a source of 
dharma according to Gautama and others - number of smrt;.s went 
on increasing - Yajnavalkya enumerates twenty writers ofSmjtis, 
Partiara 19 - Tantravartika speaks of 18 dharmasamhitas - Catur- 



iSynojms qf contents xxy 

virhsatimata gives views of 24 writers - a smrti called Sat - trimsan- 
mata- Paithlnasi enumerates 36 and so does Apararka - Vrddha 
Gautama enumerates 57 - Vframitrodaya enumerates 18 smrtis, 18 
upasmrtis and 21 more- total number of smrtis about 100 - these 
are products of widely separated ages - some entirely in prose, some 
entirely in verse, some are mixed - chronology of smrtis presents 
perplexing problems - two or three smrtis go under the same name, 
e. g. Harlta, Atri, Satatapa - sectarian zealots fabricate certain 
smrtis - the prefixes laghu, brhat and vrddha applied to smrtis - 
well-known verses are ascribed to different authors, as authors quote 
from memory. 

Sec. 31 The Manusmrti : ... pp. 135-158 

Numerous editions - Manu as the father of mankind in the 
Ugveda and other Vedas - Manu and the deluge in Satapatha-brah- 
mana - Manu in the Nirukta- Manu quoted as law-giver in Gautama, 
Apastamba and Mahabharata - introduction to Naradasmrti and 
Manu - how the Manusmrti is narrated - four versions of Svayam- 
bhuva sastra according to Bhavisyapurana - almost impossible to say 
who composed extant Manusmrti - Buhler s theory that our Manu 
is a recast of Manavadharmasutra shown above to be unsustainable - 
the ManaVagrhya differs from Manusmrti in several particulars - 
'Vinayakasanti of Manavagrhya and tests for selecting a bride not 
containedj in our Manu - Mahabharata distinguishes between Svaya- 
mbhuva Manu and Pracetasa Manu, former promulgating dharma- 
sastra - tjpe two works combined in the present Manu - extant 
Manu hm 12 chapters and 2694 verses - its style - contents of Manu - 
smrti - <|itent of literature known to Manusmrti - the author of the 
Manusnjjjai is not the first legislator - age of Manusmrti - external 
cvidenccjfitt Medhitithi's is first extant commentary - Visvarupa

Brhaspa|Jthvid the present text of Manu before him - Asvagho§a in 
his VaJMTei:i quotes several verses from 'Manavadharma' some ot 
which Jlgiound in our Manu - Ramayaria ( Kislcindha 18. 50-32 )

flesh-eating - Biihler's conclusion is that cosomological and philoso- 
phical portions in ist and 12th books, rules about mixed castes and 
duties of castes in 10th book are later additions - all additions made 
before 3rd century a. d.- Manusmrti has not suffered several recasts - 
quotations cited as Vrddha Manu and Btiian-Manu are later than 
Manusmrti - extant Manu older than Yfijnavalkya - Manu mentions 
Yavanas, Kambojas, Sakas, Pahlavas and Cinas - extant Manusmrti 
composed between 2nd century b. c. and 2nd century a. d. - rela- 
tion of Mahabharata and Manu - conflict of views between Mandlik, 
Hopkins and Buhler - Hopkins holds that there was a mass of float- 
ing verses ascribed to mythical Manu on which both Manusmrti and 
Mahabharata drew - Buhler says that the floating mass of verses was 
not all attributed to Manu - Manu mentions stories and names that 
occur in the Mahabharata but these names go into Vedic antiquities - 
Manu never names the Mahabharata, while the latter often refers to 
'rajadharmas or sastra of Manu* or to 'what Manu said' - Both 
Hopkins and Buhler hold that the Anusasanaparva and Santiparva 
knew a Manusmrti, but earlier books, whenever they speak of Manu, 
refer to floating mass of popular verses - this conclusion not correct - 
final conclusion, viz., long before 4th century b. c. there was a 
dharmasastra in verse attributed to Svayambhuva Manu, there was 
another work on rajadharma attributed to Pracetesa Manu, that pro- 
bably there was one work, then between 200 b. c. and . 200 A, D. 
Manusmrti was recast • extant Mahabharata later than extant Manu- 
smrti - influence of Manu spread to Cambodia and others countries 
beyond India- Manu had several commentators, Mcdhatitk ^Govinda-

Sec. 33 Tj^PuratHis : ... pp,i6o-i<br 

Puririas as a class of literature mentioned in Taittiriya Aran- 
yaka, Chandogya Upanisad, Gautama Dh. S., Mahabhasya - extant 
puranas are recasts made of older material - some of the extant 
Puranas like Vayu earlier than 6th century a. d. -Names of principal 
1 8 Puranas - 18 Upapuranas- Matsyapurana contains much dharma- 
sastra material - Agnipurana contains disquisition on rajadharma and 
chapters 253-258 contain almost the whole of the vyavahara section 
of Yajiiavalkya - Garudapurana borrows about 400 verses from 
acara and prayascitta sections of Yajiiavalkya - chronology of Puranas 
passed over - Divergence as to the names of the principal 18 puranas 
and as to the> extent - Puranas very valuable for study of social and 
religious questions as to mediaeval and modern India - Padmapurana 
, divides 18 Puranas into three groups of sattvika, rajasa, tamasa and 
divides eighteen smrtis also in the same way - table showing which 
dharmasastra topics are dealt with in which purana. 

Sec. 34 The Ydjn*v*lky*smrti : PP- 168-190

stories about strained relations between Vaisampayana and Yajna- 
valkya - Yajiiavalkya and Janaka in the Satapathabrahmana - Yajiia- 
valkya, a great philosopher in the Brhadaranyaka - Yajiiavalkya 
srcrti clairtis that the Aranyaka and Yogasastra were composed by 
the author of the smrti - slight variation in the number of verses 
contained in Yajiiavalkyasmrti according to Visvarupa, Mitaksara 
and Apalrarka - arrangement of verses different in Visvarupa and 
Mitaksap, particularly in the prayascittakanda - readings of the two 
commemtators also differ - Agnipurana affords excellent check for 
consideration of text of Yajiiavalkya - Readings of Agnipurana com- 
pared w/ith those of Visvarupa and the Mitaksara - conclusion is that 
the Agrjipurana represents a text midway between Visvarupa and 
that of jthe Mitaksara - So Agnipurana represents a text of Yajiiaval- 
kya current about 900 a. d. - total number of verses on vyavahara 
in the Agnipurana is 315, out of which the first 31 are not taken 
from Yajiiavalkya - almost all of these 31 taken from Narada- 
Garudi purana ( chap. 93 ) expressly says that the dharma promul- 
gated \y Yajiiavalkya was imparted therein - Garuda (chap. 93-106

with prayascitta-Garudapurana omits rajadharma section -of Yajna- 
valkya - only a few verses of Yaj. are repeated word for word, while 
a summary only is given of several verses - comparison of the 
text of the Garudapurana with Visvariipa's text and that of the 
Mitaksara - Garudapurana represents text intermediate between 
Visvarupa and Mitaksara - are there different strata in Yajnavalkya ? 
text mainly the same from 700 a. d. and little evidence to show 
that the text of Yajnavalkya as we have it contains several strata - 
comparison of Yajnavalkyasmrti with Manusmrti - close agreement 
in phraseology between the two - Yajnavalkya usually tries to com- 
press Manu's dicta - Yaj. adds Vinfiyakasanti and Grahasiinti and 
ordeals, while Manu omits first two and cursorily* r i.fcrs to two 
ordeals - Yaj. silent on origin of world which we have in Manu - 
style of Yajnavalkya - contents of smrti - literature known to Yaj- 
navalkyasmrti - enumerates 19 authors on dharma - close agree- 
ment between Visnu Dh. S. and Yajnavalkya and between Kautilya 
and Yaj. - Manu and Yaj. differ on several points and Yaj. represents 
a more advanced state of thought than Manu - Manu allows brah- 
mana to marry sudra girl, Yaj. docs not - Manu condefly": .ni.voga> 
Yaj. does not - same case with gambling - Yaj. takes Yayakasanti 
from Manavagrhya -Yajnavalkyasmrti in intimate relati^ to white 
Yajurveda and literature appurtenant to it-Yajnavay a closely 
agrees with Paraskaragrhya - Dr. Jolly's theory that Yfiavalkya's 
work goes back to a dharmasutra of White Yajurveda s without 
foundation - date of Yajnavalkyasmrti -Visvarupa sepaited from 
the smrti by several ccncurics - probable date of Yajnavalky between 
100 b. c. and 300 a. d. - Larikavatarasutra (gathas 814-811) refers 
to Yajnavalkyasmrti - Dr. Jolly thinks that Yaj. shows acqi a intance 
with Greek astrology - Dr. Jacobi's theory that naming f week 
days after planets fust introduced by Greeks and borrcwed by 
Indians - these theories untenable - Yaj. does not mention week 
days, but only the nine planets ( in I. 296 ) - Yaj. docs not mention 
the zodiacal signs - he arranges the naksatras from Kmika to 
Bharani ( I. 268 ) as the TaittirTyabrahmana does - c susthe it^u' in 
Yaj. explained by Visvarupa without reference to zodiacal} si<ms-

robed people as an evil omen - Dr. Jolly's date of 400 a. d. for 
Yajnavalkya is far too late - there is a Vrddha-Yaj., a Yoga-Yaj., 
and a Brhad-Yaj. - Yoga-Yaj naval kya existed much earlier than' 800 
a. d. as Vacaspatimisra quotes a halt verse from Yoga-Yaj. and 
Apararka quotes profusely from him - mss. of Yoga-Yaj navalkya in 
Deccan College collection in 12 chapters and 495 vereses and of 
Brhad- Yogi- Yaj navalkya in 12 chapters and 920 verses - Yoga- Yaj- 
navalkya and Brhad- Yogi-Yaj navalkya of the mss. are entirely differ-

Vijnancsvara, Apararka and Sulapani. 

Sec. 35 Paraiarasmrti : ... 190-196 

Yaj. mentions Parasara, but the extant Parasarasmrti is pro- 
bably a recast of an older smrti - Garudapurana ( chap. 107 ) gives a 
summary of 39 verses of Parasarasmrti - From Kautilya it appears 
there was a work of Parasara on politics - extant Parasara in 12 cha- 
pters and 592 verses deals with acara and prayascitta alone - 
Parasara, au ancient name - Parasara mentions 19 smrti writers- 
contents of the smrti - Parasara has peculiar views - authors cited by

betwee^n Narada and Manu - printed Narada contains 1028 verses - 
about (700 verses of Narada quoted in digests - Visvarupa's and 
Medhajjcithi's quotations from Narada agree with printed Narada - 
Agniplirana chap. 253 contains thirty verses of Naradasmrti defining 
the ci&hteen titles from rnadana to prakirnaka in the same order -

HISTORY OF DHARMASASTRA. 

i. Meaning of Dharma. 

Dbartna is one of those Sanskrit words that defy all attempts 
at an exact rendering in English or any other tongue. That word hat- 
passed through several vicissitudes. In the hymns of the Rgveda the 
word appears to be used either as an adjective or a noun (in the form 
dharman, generally neuter ) and occurs at least fifty-six times therein. 
It is very difficult to say what the exact meaning of the word dharma 
was in the most ancient period of the vedic language. The word 
is clearly derived from root dhr ( to uphold, to support, to nourish). 
In a few passages, the word appears to be used in the sense of * up- 
holder or supporter or sustained as in Rg. I. 187. i f and X. 92.2*. In 
these two passages and in Rg. X. 21.3 J the word dhurma is clearly 
masculine. In all other cases, the word is either \ jviously in the 
neuter or presents a form which may bv, either masculine or neuter. 
In most cases the meaning of dharnian is 4 religious ordinances or 
rites' as in Rg. I. 22. 18, V. 26. 6, VIII. 43. 24, IX. 64. 1 &c. 
The refrain ' tani dharmani prathamanyasan ' occurs in Rg. I. 164, 
43 and 50, X. 90. 16. Similarly we have the words ' prathama 
dharma ' ( the primeval or first ordinances) in Rg. III. 17. 1. and X. 
56.3 and the words ' sanatii dharmani (ancient ordinances) 
occur in Rg. III. 3.1. In some passages this sense of ' religious 
rites' would not suit the context, e. g. in IV. 53. 34, V. 63. 75, 
VI. 70. i 6 , VII. 89. 5 7 . In these passages the meaning seems to be 
'fixed principles or rules of conduct'. In the Vajasaneyasamhita 
the above senses of the word dharman are found and in 11. 3 and V. 
27 we have the words ' dhruvena dharmaruV. In the same Samhita

the form ' dharmah ' ( from d ha rma ) becomes frequent, e.g. X, 
29, XX. 0. The Atharvaveda contains many of those verses of the 
Rgvcda/m which the word dharman occurs, e. g. VI. 51. 3 ( acittya 
chet tifva dharma yuyopima), VII, >. 1 ( Vajnena yajfiamayajanta ) 
VllJz']. 5 (mni pada vicakrame). In XI. 9. 17 the word 'dharmah' 
seprns to be used in the sense of ' merit acquired by the performance 

r religious rites*.' In the Aitareya-bnihmana, the word dharma 
seems to be used in an abstract sense', viz. ' the whole body of re- 
ligious duties'. In the Chandogya-upanisad''' (2. 23 ) there is 
an important passage bearing on the meaning of the word dharma 
' there are three branches of dharma, one is (constituted by) sacrifice, 
study and charity ( i. e. the stage of house-holder ) ; the second ( is 
constituted by ) austerities ( i. e. the stage of being a hermit); the 
third is the brahmacariii dwelling in the house of his teacher and 
•' himself stay with the family of his teacher till the last ; all 
making ' 1 to the worlds of meritorious men ; one who abides 
these attain - attains immortality.' It will be seen that in this

1. Meaning of Dharma 3 

sages requested Manu to impart instruction in the dharmas of all the 
varms. The Yajnyavalkya-smriti ( I. i ) employs it in the same 
sense. In the Tnmra-Vartika 11 also we are told that all the dharma- 
sutras are concerned with imparting instruction in the dharmas, of 
varnas and tiiramas. Medhatithi commenting on Manu s:\s 
that the expounders of smrtis dilate upon dharma as five-fold, e. £* 
vawadhanna, asrmna-dhai ma, vartjaframa-dbarwa, naimitttkadharma 
( such as prayascitta ) and gunadharma ( the duty of a crowned 
king, whether Ksatriya or not, to protect ) 12 . It is in this sense 
that the word dharma will be taken in this work. Numerous topics 
are comprehended under the title dharmasastra, but in this work 
prominence will be given to works on acard and vyavahara ( law 
and administration of justice ). 

It would be interesting to recall a few other definitions of dharma. 
Jaimini 1 * defines dharma as 'a desirable goal or result that is indicated 
by injunctive (Vedic) passages.' The word dharma would mean such 
rites as are conducive to happiness and are enjoined by Vedic pas- 
sages. The Vaisesikasutra 1 * defines dharma as 'that from which results 
happiness and final beatitude.' There are several other more or less 
one-sided definitions of dharma such as ' ahimsa paramo dharmah ' 
( Anusasanaparva 115. 1.), r anr£amsyam paro dharmah' (Vanaparva 
373. 76), c acarah paramo dharmah ' ( Manu I. 108 ). Harita defin- 
ed dharma as ' srutipramanaka 15 * ( based on revelation ). In the 
Buddhist sacred books the word dharma has several senses. It often 
means the whole teaching of Buddha (S.B.E. Vol. X. p. XXXIII). 
Another meaning of dharma peculiar to the Buddhist system is 'an 
element of existence, i. e. of matter, mind and forces 16 .' 

The present w r ork will deal with the sources of dharma, their 
contents, their chronology and other kindred matters. As the

material is vast and the number of works is extremely -large, only a 
few selected works and some important authors will be taken up for 
detailed treatment. More space will be devoted to comparatively 
early works. 

2. Sources of Dharma. 

The Gautamadharmasiitra 77 says c the Veda is the source of 
dharma and the tradition and practice of those that know it ( the 
Veda )/ So Apastamba 18 says ' the authority ( for the dharmas ) is 
the consensus of those that know dharma and the Vedas. ' Vide 
also the Vasisthadharma-sutra 1 * ( I. 4-6 ). The Manusmrti 10 lays 
down five different sources of dharma ' the whole Veda is ( the fore- 
most ) source of dharma and ( next ) the tradition and the practice 
of those that know it (the Veda); and further the usages of virtuous 
men and self-satisfaction.' Yajnavalkya 21 declares the sources in a 
similar strain ' the Veda, traditional lore, the usages of good men, 
what is agreeable to one's self and desire born of due deliberation — 
this is traditionally recognised as the source of dharma.' These 
passages make it clear that the principal sources of dharma were con- 
ceived to be the Vedas, the Smrtis, and customs. The Vedas do 
not contain positive precepts (yidhis) on matters of dharma in a con- 
nected form ; but they contain incidental references to various topics 
that fall under the domain of dharmasastra as conceived in later 
times. Such information to be gathered from the Vedic Literature 
is not quite as meagre as is commonly supposed. In another place 22 
I have brought together about fifty Vedic passages that shed a flood 
of light on marriage, the forms of marriage, the different kinds of 
sons, adoption of a son, partition, inheritance, irfiddha, stridhana. 
To take only a few examples. That brotherless maidens found it 
difficult to secure husbands is made clear by several Vedic passages.

' Like ( a woman ) growing old in her parents* house, - spray to thee 
as Bhaga from the seat common to all 23 '. Vide also Rgvedft I 124. 7; 
IV. 5. 5 and Atharvaveda I. 17. 1 and Nirukta III. 4-5V ^ These 
passages constitute the basis of the rules of the dharmasutrav? and 
the Yajnavalkya-smrti against marrying a brothcrless maiden 2 '. '3(^his 
bar against marrying a brothcrless maiden seems to have been d^e 
to the fear that su£?i a girl might be an appointed daughter {ptitrikt^) 
and that a son born of such a girl would be affiliated to his mother^ 
father. This custom of putriktl is an ancient one and is alluded to 
in the llgvcda, according to Yaska 2J . "Ilgveda X. 85 is a very in- 
teresting hymn as regards marriage ; verses from it arc used even to 
this day in the marriage ritual. 26 It shows that in the remote Vedic 
age the marriage rite resembled in essence the Brahma form as des- 
cribed in the Dharmasutras and Manu.~ : But the purchase of a 
bride (i. e. what is called Asura marriage in later literature ) was not 
unknown in the Vedic age. A passage of the Maitmyaniyasarhhita 
(I. 10. n ) is referred to in the Vasisthadharmasutra 2S in this con- 
nection, viz. * she who being purchased by the husband \ The 
Gandharva form is hinted at in the words 21 ' * when a bride is fine- 
looking and well adorned, she seeks by herself her friend among 
men \ The importance of the nimisti son was felt even in the remote 
Vedic ages. ' Another ( person ) born of another's loins, though 
very pleasing, should not be taken, should not be even thought of 
(as to be taken in adoption' 1 ' )\ The Taittiriya-saiiihita (VI. 3. 10. 5) 
propounds the well-known theory of the three debts* 1 . The story

of SunahSepa jq the Aitareya-brahmana ( VII. 3 ) suggests that a

Taittinya-sjftihihta (VII. 1.8. 1) tells the story of Atri who gave an 
only soiy in adoption to Anrva. The Ksetraja son of the Dharma- 
sutras ife often referred to in the earliest Vedic literature. ' What 
( saanficer ) invites you ( Asvins ) in his house to a bed as a widow 
doefe a brother-in-law or a young damsel her lover' ^. The Taittirl- 
yadliitihita makes it clear that a lather could distribute his wealth 
Imong his sons during his own life time c Manu divided his property 
among his sons' &c. 35 Another passage of the same Samhita seems 
to suggest that the eldest son took the whole of the father's wealth 
' therefore people establish their eldest son with wealth '». liven in 
the Vedic ages the son excluded the daughter from inheritance l a 
son born of the body does not give the paternal wealth to (his) 
sister'* 1 . A passage of the Taittiriya-samhita is relied upon by ancient 
and modern writers on dharwnsilstrn for the exclusion of women in 
general from inheritance c therefore women being destitute of 
strength take no portion and speak more weakly than even a low 
person' 36 . The Kgveda eulogises the stage of studenthood and the 
Satapathabrahmana speaks of the duties of the Brahmacarin such as not

Taittiriya-sariihita (VI. 2. 8. 5) relates* 8 howlndra consigned Yatisto 
wolves (or dogs) and how Prajapati prescribed a Priiyascitfc^for him. 
The Satapathabrahmana speaks of the king and the learned Brahmana 
as the upholder of the sacred ordinances." The Taittiriyas^tiihita 
says c therefore the Siidra is not fit for sacrifice* . ' The Aifcjreya 
Brahmana tells us that when a king or other worthy guest cot> .<r s > 
people offer a bull or a cow* 1 . The Satapatha-brahmana speaks v>* 
Yedir study as yajfui and the Taittiriya-aranyaka*- enumerates th V e 
five yajfias, which are a prominent feature of the Manusmrti. Tin - 
Rgveda eulogises the gifts of a cow, horses, gold and clothes* 5 . 
Another passage of the Rgveda n ( thou "art like a prapd in a desert ) 
is relied upon by Sahara on faimini (I. 3. 2) and by Visvarupa on 
Yajiiavalkya as ordaining the maintenance of prapiis ( places where 
water is distributed to travellers ). The Rgveda condemns the selfish 
man who only caters for himself 1 ; . 

The foregoing brief discussion will make it clear that the later 
rules contained in the dharmasutras and other works on dharma- 
Ziistra had their roots deep down in the most ancient Vedic tradition 
and that the authors of the dbiiniutsulras were quite justified in look- 
ing up to the Vedas as a source of dbiinint. But, as said above, 
ihe Yedas do not profess to be formal treatises on dhtirnnt \ they 
contain only disconnected statements on the various aspects of 
dhitrma ; we have to turn to the smrtis for a formal and connected 
treatment of the topics of the dbitnnasiislra.

History of Dharmaiattra 

When Dharmasastra works were first composed 

ofSunahfept . . . f i r i 

son could ' lm P ortant question is to find out when formal treatises 
Taittirl va - rma ^ e 8 an t0 be composed. It is not possible to give a definite 
only sor er t0 l ^ s questiou. The Nirukta (III. 4-5) shows that long 
sutras ijre Yaska heated controversies had raged on various questions of 
r sa( yheritance, such as the exclusion of daughters by sons and the rights 
doe/" l ' le a PP°i mt> d daughter (putrika). It is very likely that these dis- 
y a Jcussions had found their way in formal works and were not merely 
^confined to the meetings of the learned. The manner in which 
Yaska writes suggests that he is referring to works in which certain 
Vedic verses had been cited in support of particular doctrines about 
inheritance 16 . It is further a remarkable thing that in connection 
with the topic of inheritance Yaska quotes a verse, calls it a sloka 
and distinguishes it from a rk J 7 This makes it probable that works 
dealing with topics of dbaniui existed either composed in the sloka 
metre or containing ilokas. Scholars like Biihler would say that the 
verses were part of the floating mass of mnemonic verses, the exist- 
ence of which he postulates without very convincing or cogent 
arguments in his Introduction to the Manusmrti ( S. B. R. vol. 25 
Intro.xc). If works dealing with topics oidbarma existed before Yaska, 
a high antiquity will have to be predicated for them. The high 
antiquity of works on dbarmasaslra follows from other weighty con- 
siderations. It will be seen later on that the extant dbarmasnlras of 
Gautama, Baudhayana and Apastamba certainly belong to the period 
between 600 to 300 B. C. Gautama** speaks of dbarmasastras and 
the word dharmasastra occurs in Baudhayana also (IV. 5.9). Baudha- 
yana speaks of a dharnmpathahi (I. 1. 9.). Besides Gautama quotes in 
numerous places the views of others in the words ' ityeke ' ( e. g. II. 
15, II. 58, III. 1, IV. 21, VII. 23 ). He refers to Manu« in one 
place and to ' Acaryas ' in several places ( III. 36, IV. 18 and 23 ).

8. When Dharmaiastra works were first composet 

Baudhayana mentions by name several writers on dharma, v^ f or him. 
jarighani, Katya, Kasyapa, Gautama, Maudgalya and Hanta.-^hmaiia 
tamba also cites the views of numerous sa^cs such as those o^mhita 
Kanva, Kautsa, Hanta and others. There is a Vartika which sp^reya 
of Dharmasatra* . Jaimini speaks of the duties of a &ihlra as t e S , 
down in the dharmasastra* 1 . Patanjali shows that in his days dhtiniUiof 
siitras existed and that their authority was very high, being next ti \e 
the commandments of God 52 . He quotes verses and dogmas tiui*t 
have their counterparts in the dharmasiitras. The foregoing dis 
cussion establishes that works on the dhanittisastra existed prior to 
Yaska or at least prior to the period 600-300 15. C. and in the 2nd 
century B. C. they had attained a position of supreme authority in 
regulating the conduct of men. 

In this book the whole of the extant literature on dharma will 
be dealt with as follows :- -First come the dharmasiitras, some of 
which like those of Apastamba, lliranyakesin and Baudhayana form 
part of a larger Sutra collection, while there are others like those o\ 
Gautama and Vasistha which do not form part of a larger collec- 
tion ; some d ha r mas films like that of Visnu are, in their extant form, 
comparatively later in date than other siilni works; some suha 
works like those of Sankha-Likhita and Paithlnasi are known onl\ 
from quotations. Then early metrical smrtis like those of Mann and 
Yajnavalkya will be taken up for discussion ; then later versified 
smrtis like that of Narada ; there are many smrti works like those 
of Brhaspati and Katyayana that are known only from quotations. 
The two epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, and the Puranas 
also have played a great part in the development of the Dharma- 
sastra. The commentaries on the smrtis, such as those of Visvarupa, 
Medhatithi, Vijiianesvara, Apararka, Haradatta will be next passed

1° History of Dharmafadra 

in review and then the digests on dharma such as the works of 

Hemaciri, Todaramalla, Nilakantha and others. 
• 

Ij'ls very difficult to settle the chronology of the works on 

dlnrmasastra, particularly of the earlier ones. The present writer 

J^cs not subscribe to the view of Max Miiller ( H. A. S. L. p. 68 ) 

and others that works in continuous Anustubh metre followed 

sutra works". Our knowledge of the works of that period is so 

meagre that such a generalisation is most unjustifiable. Some works 

in the continuous sloka metre like the Manusmrti are certainly 

older than the Visnudharmasutra and probably as old as, if not 

older than, the Vasisthadhannasutra. One of the earliest extant 

dharmasutras, that of Baudhayana, contains long passages in the 

sloka metre, many of which are quotations and even Apastamba has 

a considerable number of verses in the sloka metre. This renders it 

highly probable that works in the sloka metre existed before them. 

Besides a large literature on dharma existed in the days of Apastamba 

and Baudhayana which has not come down to us. In the absence 

of that literature it is futile to dogmatise on such a point. 

4. The Dharmasutras. 

It seems that originally many, though not all, of the dharma- 
sutras formed part of the Kalpasutras and were studied in distinct 
sulracaranas. Some of the extant dharmasutras here and there 
show in unmistakable terms that they presuppose the Grhyastttra of 
the carana to which they belong. Compare Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 4. 16 
with Ap. Gr. S. I. 12 and II. 5 ; and Baud. Dh. S. II. 8. 20 with 
Baud. Gr. S. II. 11. 42 (and other sutras)*'. The Dharmasutras 
belonging to all siitracaranas have not come down to us. There 
is no dharmasutra completing the Asvalayana Srauta and Grhya 
sutras ; no Manavadharmasutra has yet come to light, though the

4. The Dharmasutras 

Manava Srauta and Grhya sutras are extant ; in the same w: 
the Sankhayana Srauta and Grhya sutras, but no Saiikhayan 0% ? r ?~ 
sutra. It is only in the case of the Apastamba, Hiranyak._, ^ 
Baudhayana Sutracaranas that we have a complete kalpa tra 
with its three components of Srauta, Grihya and Dharma sutras 
Tantravartika of Kumarila contains very interesting observations ie 
this point. It tells us that Gautama ( dharmasutra ) and Gobhita 
( grhyasutra ) were studied by the Chaudogas ( Samavedins )\ 
Vasisfha (dharmasutra) by the Rgvedins, the dharmasutra of 
Sankha-Likhita by the followers of Vajasaneya-samhita and the 
sutras of Apastamba and Baudhayana by the followers of the Tait- 
tiriya Sakha 55 . The Tantravartika ( p. 179 ) establishes it as a sid- 
dhdnta (on Jaimini I. 3. n) that all the dharma and grhya sutras 
are authoritative for all Aryan people. From this it appears that 
although originally all sutracaranas might not have possessed 
dharmasutras composed by the founder of the caratja or ascribed 
to him, yet gradually certain dharmasutras were specially taken over 
or appropriated by certain carauas. As the dharmasutras were 
mostly concerned with rules about the conduct of men as members 
of the Aryan community and did not deal with ritual of any kind, 
all dharmasutras gradually became authoritative in all schools. 

The dharmasutras were closely connected with the grhyasntras 
in subjects and topics. Most of the Grhyasutras treat of the sacred 
domestic fire, the divisions of Grhya sacrifices, the regular morning 
and evening oblations, sacrifices on new and full moon, sacrifices 
of cooked food, annual sacrifices, marriage, pumsavana, jatakarma, 
upanayana and other sasihhlras, rules for students and snatakas and 
holidays, sraddha offerings, madhuparka. In most cases the Grihya- 
sutras confine themselves principally to the various events of 
domestic life ; they rarely give rules about the conduct of men, their 
rights, duties and responsibilities. The dharmasutras also contain 
rules on some of the above topics such as marriage and the samskaras,

in revicVf ,x ' n * ^ l ' s therefore not to be wondered at that in the 
^ em ^Zja-grhyasutra the topics of the duties of the Brahmacarin 
the house-holder, of atithis and of irdddba are meagrely 
ya as compared with the Apastamba-dharmasutra. The dharma- 
dhjiSs very rarely describe the ritual of domestic life ; they merely 
c >uch upon it ; their scope is wider and more ambitious ; their 
Vinci pal purpose is to dilate upon the rules of conduct, law and 
custom. Some sutras are common to both the Apastamba-grhya 
and the dharma siitra ;r \ Sometimes the grhyasutra appears to refer 
to the dharmasiitra* 7 . There are certain points which distinguish 
the dharmasutras ( the more ancient of them at least ) from smrtis. 
( a ) Many dharmasutras are either parts of the Kalpa belonging to 
each sutracarana or are intimately connected with the grhyasiitras. 
( b ) The dharmasQiras sometimes betray some partiality in 
their Yedic quotations for the texts of that Veda to which they 
belong or in the caranas of which they are studied, (c) The 
authors of the (older) dharmasutras do not claim to be inspired seers 
or superhuman beings> s , while the other smritis such as those of 
Mann and Yajnavalkya are ascribed to Gods like Brahma. ( d ) The 
dhanuasulnis are in prose or in mixed prose and verse ; the other 
smrtis are in \erse. (e ) The language of the dharmasutnts is generally 
more archaic than that of the other smrtis. ( f ) The dharmasutras 
do not proceed upon any orderly arrangement of topics, while the 
other smritis (even the oldest of them, viz. Manusmriti ) arrange 
their contents and treat of the subjects under three principal heads 
viz. acara, vyavahara and prayasa'tta. ( g ) Most of the dharmasutras 
are older than most of the other smrtis.

edition with the commentary of Haradatta, and the Mysore Govern- 
ment edition with the bhasya of Maskari ; it was translated by 
Buhler in S. B. E., Vol. II. with an introduction ). The Anandasrama 
edition of 1910 which is incorrect in a few places ( e. g. 21. 7 ) has 
been used in this work. This dharmasutra is, as we shall see, the 
oldest of those we have. The Gautama-dharmasutra was specially 
studied by followers of the Samaveda (see note 55 above). The com- \ 
nientary on the Caranavyuha tells us that Gautama was one of the 
nine subdivisions of the Ranayaniya school of the Samaveda. A 
teacher Gautama is mentioned frequently in the Latyayanasrautasiitra 
( e. g. 1. 3. 3 and I. 4. 17 ) and in the Drahyayanasrauta (c. g. I. 4. 
17, IX. 3. 15 ) of the Samaveda. The Gobhilagrhya (III. 10. 6) 
which belongs to the Samaveda cites Gautama as an authority. 
Therefore it is not improbable that a complete Gautamasutra embody- 
ing Srauta, Grhya and Dharma doctrines once existed. There are 
other indications pointing to the close connection of the Gautama- 
dharmasutra with the Samaveda. Chapter 26 of the dharmasutra 
about Kricchra penance is the same, almost word for word, as the 
Samavidhana* 9 Brahmana (I. 2, BurnelPs ed. ). Among the purifi- 
catory texts ( 21 in number ) mentioned in Gau. Dh. S. ( 19. 12 ) 
there are nine that are Simians. The mention of the five utterances 
( ' Vyalmis ' ) resembles the number in the Vyfihrtisama 60 though 
the order is different. It is however to be noted that Gautama is 
a generic name. In the Kathopanisad, both Naciketas (II. 4. 15, 
11. 5. 6 ) and his father (I. 1. 10) arc styled Gautama. In the 
Chandogyopanisad there is a teacher Haridrumata Gautama 

(IV-4-3)-

14 History of DharmaiUstra 

According to Haradatta the dharmasutra has 28 chapters. The 
Calcutta edition adds one chapter on Karwavipdka after chapter 19. 
In many places Gautama unmistakably refers to his own previous 
dicta ; c. g. Yathoktam va (23. 16 ) refers to 23. 10 ; 23. 26 refers 
to 17. 8-26 ; 17. 18 refers to 15. 18. The following are briefly the 
contents of the Gautaniadharmasutra : — 1. Sources of dharma, rules 
;about interpretation of texts, time of Vpanaymm for the four varyas, 
the appropriate girdle, deer skin, cloth and staff for each Varna, rules 
about iauca and acamana, method of approaching the teacher ; 2 
rules about those not invested with sacred thread, rules for the 
brahmactlrin, control of pupils, period of study ; 3 The four iisramas, 
the duties of brahmacilriu, bhikftt, and vaikhanasa ; 4 rules about 
the house-holder, marriage, age at time of marriage, eight forms of 
marriage, sub-castes ; 5 rules about sexual intercourse on marriage, 
the five great daily sacrifices, the rewards of gifts, nmdhuparka, 
method of honouring guests of the several castes ; 6 rules about 
showing respect to parents, relatives ( male and female) and teachers, 
rules of the road ; 7 rules about the avocations of a brahmana, avoca- 
tions for him in distress, what articles a brahmana could not sell or 
deal in ; 8 the forty saiiiskaras and the eight spiritual qualities ( such 
as daya, forbearance &c. ) ; 9 the observances for a snataka and 
householder ; 10 the peculiar duties of the four castes, the responsi- 
bilities of the king, taxation, sources of ownership, treasure-trove, 
guardianship of minor's wealth ; 1 1 Rajadharma, the qualities of the 
king's purohita ; 12 punishments for libel, abuse, assault, hurt, 
adultery and rape, theft in the case of the several varnas and rules 
about money-lending and usury and adverse possession, special 
privileges of brahmanas as to punishments; payment of debts, 
deposits; 1 3 rules about witnesses, falsehoods when excusable ; 14 
rules of impurity on birth and death; 15 £raddha of five kinds, 
persons not fit to be invited at Sraddha ; 16 Upakarma, period of 
Vedic study in the ycai, holidays and occasions for them ; 17 rules 
about food allowed and forbidden to Brahmanas and other castes ; 
18 the duties of women, niyoga and its conditions, discussion about 
the son born of niyoga ; 19 the causes and occasions of prayascitta, 
five things that remove sin (japa, tapas, honia, fasting, gifts ), purifi- 
catory Vedic prayers, holy food for one who practises jctpa, various 
kinds of tapas and gifts, appropriate times and places for japa &c ; 20 
abandoning a sinner who does not undergo prayascitta and the way 
of doing it j 21 sinners of various grades, mahapatakas, upapatakas 



5. The DharmasiUtra of Gautama 15 

&c. ; 22 prayascittas for various sins such as hrahmahatya, adultery, 
killing a Ksatriya, Vaisya, Sudra, cow and other animals &c. ; 23 
prayascitta for drinking wine, and nasty things, for incest and un- 
natural offences, and for several transgressions by brahmacarin ; 24 
secret priiyakittas for muhapataltas and upapatakas ; 26 the penances 
called Krcchra and Atikrcchra; 27 the penance called Candra- 
yana ; 28 partition, stridhana, reunion, twelve kinds of sons, 
inheritance. 

The Gautama-dharmasutra is written entirely in prose and it 
contains no verses either quoted or composed by the author him- 
self, as is the case with the other dharmasulras. Here and there 
occur sutras that look like portions of Anustubh verses e.g. 23. 27 6 '. 
The language of Gautama agrees far more closely with the standard 
set up by Panini than the dharmasiitras of Baudhayana and Apas- 
tamba. It is not very easy to account for this difference. It is 
obvious that commentators and generations of students that were 
brought up in the tradition of the Panincan grammar tampered with 
the text and improved it in accordance with their notions of correct 
Sanskrit. But why this process should not have been carried out 
to the same extent in the case of Apastamba it is difficult to say. 
A conjecture may be hazarded that the Ap. Dh. S. being a well-knit 
component of the Ap. Kalpa and being studied as such was less 
liable to being tampered with than the Gautama Dh. S., which 
probably did not in its origin belong to any particular kalpa. 
The same commentator, Uaradatta, explained both Gautama and 
Apastamba. Uaradatta, who as will be seen later on, was a great 
grammarian, shows in several ^places that the current reading was 
ungrammatical from the Paninean stand-point and that he preferred 
readings that were in consonance with Panini's rules 62 . There are 
still a few un-Paninean words, e. g. in 1 . 14 ('dvavimsateh' for dvavim- 
sat' ) and 9. 52 ( kulariikula ). The Tantravartika ( p. 99 ) appears

to discuss the various readings in Gautama ( I. 45'* ). A few sutras 
quoted from Gautama in the Mitaksara (e. g. the sutra 'utpatyaiva 
arthsvamitvam labhantc), thcSmrticandrika ( dvyamsam va purvajah 
syat ) and other works are not found in the extant text. This fact 
along with the fact of an interpolation of one chapter makes it clear 
that the present text of Gautama is of somewhat doubtful authority. 

The literature known to the Gautama-dharmasutra was extensive. 
Besides the Vedic samhitas and Brahmanas it mentions the following 
works ; Upanisads (19.13), the Vedangas (8.5 and n. 19), 
Itihasa (8. 6), Purana (8.6 and 11. 19), Upaveda (11. 19), 
dharmsiistra (11. 19 ). That he borrows a chapter from the Sama- 
vidhana-brahmana has been mentioned above. He borrows the first 
six sutras of the 25th chapter from the Taittinya Aranyaka (n. 18). 
The sramanaka ( in Gautama ill. 26 ) is, according to Haradaua, 
the Vaikhanasa-siistra ( either composed by Vikhanas or treating of 
the duties of hermits). Gautama refers to Anviksiki ( XL 3 ). 
The only teacher o( dhantta he quotes by name in Manu ( in 21. 7 ) 
who is cited for the proposition that there is no expiation for the 
three sins of brahwahatyd, drinking wine and violation of the bed of 
the guru. Haradaua says that in the extant Manusmrii the same 
propositions are laid down about brahnmhatya and surapana ( in 
Manu 11. 89 and 146 respectively), but that as to violation of guru* 
talpa a passage from the Manusmriti has to be searched out (i. e. 
such a passage is not found there ). From this Biihler drew the 
conclusion that Gautama refers to the dharmasutra attributed to 
Manu ( and not to any versified Manu-smrti ). But Biihler is not 
right in drawing this inference. In the first place in spite of what 
Haradaua says there arc verses in the extant Manusmriti (XL 104-105) 
which say that death is the expiation for violation of the guru's bed. 
in the second place there is nothing to show, even if Haradatta-wcre 
correct, that Gautama refers only to a dharmasutra of Manu and not 
to a versified work. Besides Manu, Gautama frequently quotes certain 
views ascribed to the ' Acaryas 5 ( e. g. III. 35, IV. 18 ). What 
teachers are meant by the word ' Acaryah ' ( which occurs in the 
Niru kta, in Kautilya and various other works), it is difficult to say. 

63 It follows from the discussion in the ct *»H l ffifr ' that the ancient pUtha in 
its day was « 55<TiT*en<f^ijj ^ffa^^RStfCT ' while tQe Present text has

5. The DharmasUtra of Oautama 1? 

Probably the word means 'the general traditional view of most writers 
in that particular sastra on a particular point/ In numerous places 
Gautama refers to the views of his predecessors in the words ' eke ' 
(2. 15, 40 and 56, 3. 1, 4. 17, 7. 23 &c. ) and ' ekesam ' ( 28. 17 
and 38 ). This proves that Gautama was preceded by great literary 
activity in the sphere of dharmasastra. Gautama 11. 28 seems to be 
a reminiscence of the Nirukta ( II. 3 ) 6 *. 

The earliest reference to Gautama as an author on dharma 
occurs in the Baudhayanadharmasutra. Baudhayana discusses the au- 
thoritativeness of usages peculiar to the north or the south and quotes 
Gautama as saying that it is wrong to hold that certain customs must 
be held authoritative in certain countries ( even though opposed to 
Vedic tradition and smrti ). This refers to G. Dh. S. 11. 20. In 
another place Baudhayana gives it as his view that a Brahmana, if he 
cannot make a living by teaching, officiating as a priest or by gifts, 
should earn his livelihood as a Ksatriya and quotes the views of 
Gautama as opposed to this 6 *. The extant Gautama on the other 
hand teaches the same view as that of Baudhayana 66 . Buhler made 
the plausible suggestion that the sutra in the extant Gautama is an 
interpolation. Govindasvami, the commentator of Baudhayana, 
suggests that another Gautama is referred to by Baudhayana. It is 
possible to suggest that in the Ms. of Gautama used by Baudhayana 
the sutra about living as a KstUriya did not occur and the next stitra 
about living as a Vaisya alone occurred. Chapter 19 of the Gautama- 
dharmasutra which forms an introduction to prayascittns in Gautama 
seems to have been borrowed wholesale by Baudhayana (III. 10) with 
slight changes. That Baudhayana borrows follows from the fact that 
the chapter in Baudhayana occurs in the middle of the discussion 
about prayascittas and not as an introduction, which is the case in 
Gautama. Baudhayana treats of penances in several places ( II. i, 
III. 5. 10 and IV. 1. 4). There are besides many sutras in both 
Gautama and Baudhayana that exhibit a close correspondence, e. g.

quotes ihc views of Gautama in two places ( 4. 34 and 36, impurity 
on death). The first refers to Gautama 4. .|i but the second cannot 
be traced in the extant Gautama. Chapter 22 of Yasistha is bor- 
rowed from the Gauiamadharinasutra, chapter 19. There are besides 
many sutras that are the same or almost the same in Gautama and

smrti (III. 16) as the son of Utathya. Gautama is one of the authors 
i)i ithari}!<L\<islnis enumerated in Yajnavalkya (I. 5). Apararka quotes 
a verse from the Bhavisvapurana which speaks of Gautama's pro- 
hibition about drinking-. Similarly Kulluka ( on Manu XI. 146) 
ijuotcs a verse from the same Purana which refers to Gautama 23.2. 
Kumarila in his Tantraxartika quotes over a dozen sutras from 
Gautama which present the same text as we have 68 . Gautama 11. 
29 and 12. 4 are quoted by Samkara in his hha$ya on Vedantasutra 
II!. 1. (S and I. 5. 38 respectively. Visvarupa in his commentary on 
Yajnavalkya quotes numerous sutras from Gautama. In Medha- 
tithi's bhiifxa on Manu the writer more frequently quoted than any 
other is Gautama ( e. g. on Manu II. 6, VIII. 125 &c). 

The foregoing discussion about the literature known to the 
Gautama Dh. S. and the authors and works that mention Gautama 
or quote the dharmasutra helps us in arriving at the approximate 
age of the dharmasiUra. lie is separated by a long interval from the

nism by Buddha and his followers. Me uses the icrm Bhiksu 
( 3. 10) instead of the term parivrajaka that occurs in Baudha- 
yana, Apastamba and other sutra works and lays down that a bhiksu 
is to stay in one place in the rains, which reminds one of the Bud- 
dhist ' bhikkhu ' and c Vasso \ Gautama cites the opinion of some 
that Yavana is the offspring of a Ksatriya male and a Siidra female 
(4, 17 ). It is supposed by many scholars that the Yavanas became 
known to the Indians only at the time of Alexander's invasion and 
hence every work in which the word Xiivmiti occurs must be later 
than 320 B.C. Biihler ( S. B. H. vol. 11. Intro, i.vi. ) seems to 
suggest that the sutra where the word Yavana occurs in Gautama 
may be an interpolation. This is not a satisfactory explanation. 
One may ask, if Bu'hler believes that the Indians borrowed their 
alphabet centuries before Alexander from the . neighbours of the 
Greeks, why it is improbable that the Indians may not have heard of 
the word Yavana centuries before Alexander and why Yavanas mav 
not have resided in India long before that date. Taking all these 
things into consideration the Gautama-dharmasutra cannot be placed 
later than the period between 600-400 B. C. 

Haradatta wrote a learned commentary on the Gautama-dharma- 
sutra called Mitaksara. For an account vide sec. 87 below. In numer- 
ous places he quotes the explanations of other commentators of 
Gautama (e.g. 9. 52; 10. 12, 56, 66; n. 17; 12. 32; 2i.y&c. ). 
The bhiisya of Maskari, son of Yamana, is also a learned one, but 
may probably be later than Haradatta, since the interpretations which 
he quotes as given by others are found to be those of Haradatta 
(vide on Gaut. 12. 30, 13. 20-22 ). 

Asahaya seems to have written a bhasya on Gautama; vide sec. 59 
below. 

The Mitaksara, the Smrticandrika, Hemadri, Madhava, and 
other writers quote a sloka-Gautama. Vide Parasara-Madhavlya, 
vol. I, part I, p. 7. Apararka, Hemadri and Madhava quote Vrddha- 
Gautama, while the Dattakamimariisa ( p. 72 ) quotes Vrddha-Gaut. 
and Brhad-Gaut. side by side on the same point. These are later 
works. Jivananda publishes a smrti of Yrddha-Gautama in 22 
chapters and about 1700 verses ( part II, pp. -| 97-6} 6 ), where it is 
said that Yudhisthira asked Krsna about the dhuntMs of the feu. 
castes. This smrti seems to have been originally taken from the 
Aivarnedhikaparva of the Mahabharata, as Madhava and others cite

verses occurring in it as from that parva ( vide Parasaramadhaviya 
vol, I, part I, pp. 108-110). 

} 6. The Baudhayana Dharmasutra. 

A * This has been edited several times ( text by Dr. Hultzsch 
at Leipzig in 1884, text in the Anandasrama collection of smitis 
and in the Mysore Government Oriental Series in 1907 with the 
commentary of Govindasvamin ; translated in S. B. E., Vol. 14, 
with an Introduction). The Mysore edition has been- used in 
this work. Baudhayana is a teacher of the Krsnayajurveda. A 
complete set of the Baudhayanasiitras has not yet been recovered and 
has not been as carefully preserved as the sutras of Apastamba and 
Hiranyakesin. Dr. Burncll arranges Baudhayana's sutras into six 
sutras, the Srautasutra in 19 prasnas ( probably ) ; Karmantasutra in 
20 adhyayas ; Dvaidhasutra in four prasnas ; Grhyasutra in four 
prasnas ; Dharmasutra in four prasnas ; Sulvasutra in three adhyayas. 
The commentators offer no indication as to the place originally assign- 
ed to the grbya, dhanna and inlva sutras in the whole collection. Dr. 
Caland in his monograph (A.D. 1903) 'Uber das Rituelle sutra des 
Baudhayana* gives on p. 12 the contents of the Baudhayanasutra as 
follows: Prasnas I-XXI Srama, XXII-XXV Dvaidha, XXVI-XXVIII 
Karmanta ; XX1X-XXXI lViyascitta, XXXII Sulvasutra, XXXIII- 
XXXV Grhvasutra, XXXVI Grhvapnivascitta ; XXXVII Grhya- 
paribhasa, XXXVIII-XLI (; r hyaparisista ; XLII-XIJV Pitmiedha, 
XLV Pravara, XLVI-XLIX Dharma. Dr. Caland edited nine prainas 
of the Srautasutra for the B. I. Series ( A. D. T904 ). Dr. R. Sham- 
sastri published for the Mysore University ( in 1920) the Baudhaya- 
nagrhyasutra with parihhdsa, grhyascsa, Pitrmedhasutra. The 
Grhyasutra cites the view of Baudhayana himself ( I. 7 ). The 
Baudhayana-dharma refers to the Grhva and presupposes it in several 
piaces ( vide note 54 ). In the Baudhayanagrhya ( III. 9. 6 ) we have 
a reference to padakara Atreya, Vmikara Kaundinya, pravacanakara 
Kanva Bodhayana, and Sutrakara Apastamba. 68 ** A similar passage

occurs in the Bharadvaja Grhyasutra. In the Baudhayana-dharma- 
sutra (II. 5. 27 Rsitarpana ) we have Kanva Bodhayana, Apas- 
tamba sutrakara and Satyasadha Iliranyakcsin one after another. 
These references show that Kanva Bodhfiyana. was an ancient sage 
when the Baudhayana-dharmasiitra was written and that he could 
not have been the author of the grhya or the dharma sutras of 
Baudhayana. Baudhfiyana may have been a descendant of this Kanva 
Bodhayana. This surmise is supported by Govindasvamin who 
explains Baudhayana occurring in Baudhayanadharmasutra I. 3. 13, 
as Kanvayana. In the dharmasutra Baudhayana is himself 
cited as an authority several times (e.g. I. 4. 15 and 24, III. 5. 8, 
III. 6. 20). In all these places the Mysore edition reads Bodhayana, 
while the Anandasrama reads Baudhayana. In one or two places he 
is styled c bhagavan ' ( III. 6. 20 ). Several explanations are offered 
by the commentator Govindasvamin (on I. 3. 13 ). He says that 
it is the practice of the Acaryas to refer to themselves in the third 
person ( as Medhatithi says on Manu 69 ) or that the author of the 
dharmasutra is a pupil of Baudhayana as the Manusmrti is promul- 
gated by Bhrgu, the pupil of Manu, or there was some other Baudha- 
yana whose works have not come down to us. 

The following are the contents of the Baudhayana-tlharmasutra: — 
Prahia 1:- -Sources of dharma > who are sis.fas, parisad, different 
pnetices of northern and southern India, countries where sistas 
reside and where mixed castes reside, prayascitta for visiting

time of upanayamt and the girdle, skin, staff appropriate to each caste, 
duties of brabmaciirin, eulogy of brabmacarya ; 3. The duties of the 
snataka who has completed his studies and observances but has not

sion to gel these tilings done through another in certain circum- 
stances. 

The extant Dharmasutra does not appear to have come down in- 
tact. The fourth praina is most probably an interpolation. Most 
of the eight chapters of that prasna are full of verses, the portion in 
prose being very small. The last three chapters (6-8) arc entirely 
in verse. The style is quite different from thai of the first two 
prasnas. The first five chapters of the fourth prasna dealing with 
prayascittas are more or less superfluous, the same subject having 
been dealt with in M. i and III. |-io. Some of the sfitras in the 
earlier prainas are repeated verbatim in the fourth, e. g. TT. 1. 33-M 
and IV. 2. io-n (avaldrm-prayascitta). The third prasna also is 
not free from doubt. The tenth chapter of the third prasna is 
as said above taken from Gautama. The sixth chapter of the third 
prasna agrees very closely in phraseology with the .|<Sih chapter of 
the YivSniKlharmasutra. But it is rather di/Hcuh to say which is the 
borrower. Dr. Jolly (S.B.li. Vol. VII. p. XIX) is inclined to think- 
that both borrowed from a common source. It seems more probable 
that Visnu borrows from Baudhayana, as the Visiuulharmasfura 
uses the form ' pumta ' in place of ' punatha y (in Baud. ) and as the 
Visnu-Dharmasutra omits all reference to Rudra (Baud. 1 1 1. 6. 12.) 
and omits the words " g,anan pasyati, ganadVnpatim pasyati . . . 
bl.agavan Bodhayanah M ( Baud i r 1.6. 20. ). In the Mysore edition 
all the four prasnas of the Dharmasutra are divided into adhxavas, 
but the Mss used by Biihler appear to ha\e divided the first two 
prasnas into kandikas and the last two into adhyayas. There are 
manv repetitions even in the first two prasnas, which therelore make 
one rather doubtful about the authenticity of the first two prasnas 
also in their entiretv. I ; or example JJ. 6. 1 1 and ]\ are indentical ; 
in TL 7, 22 and IT. 10. 53 the same verse ( "astau grasa " &c. ) 
is quoted. Such repetitions are frequent in the two last prasnas e. g. 
III. 2. 16 and lil.3.23 ; HL.|.) and III. 7. 12. Some of the quotations 
ascribed to Baudhayana in the Mitaksara and other works are not 
taken from the tibarntasnlra, but Ironi the Grhyasutr.i or its supple- 
ments (e. g. the words ' ckaiii sakham-adhite srotrivah " quoted in 
the Mit. on Yaj. III. 24, which are cited by I lult/sch (on p. 125) are 
taken from the Grhya (vide note 78 below ). 

The Dharmasutra of Baudhayana is somewhat loose in structure 
and is not concise. Govindasvamin remarks ( on JL 2. 19. ) that 



ii History of Dharmaiaatra 

Baudhayana docs not aim at brevity. ?° Several subjects are treated of 
in two places and often without any logical connection with what 
precedes or follows. Rules of inheritance (daya-bhaga) occur in 
the midst of rules about prayascitta ( in fl. 2. ); rules about holidays 
(anadhyaya ) occur immediately after the eight forms of marriage 
and the condemnation of the sale of a daughter (I. 11). Rules 
about snalahi occur in two places ( I. 3 and 11. 3. 10 il. ). Baudha- 
yana quotes at least 90 verses introduced by the words " athapyuda- 
haranti/' more than 80 being from the fuwt two prasnas alone. There 
are over two hundred oilier verses, about 80 of which occur in the 
first two prasnas and about ten are Vedic. Some of the verses even 
in the first two prasnas do not appear to be quotations e. g. I. 1. 16, 
II. 2. 1, II. 3. 50, II. 3. 52-54 and 56. A verse quoted is in the 
Vaihsastha metre ( IV. 3. 14 ); there are two verses in the Upajati 
metre taken as a quotation (II. 3.18 ). There are some prose quota- 
tions introduced with the words tc athapyudaharanti 51 (e. g. II. 4. 5 
and II. 6. 30 which afcrs to the iisi;ni Kapila, son of Prahlada). 
The language of the Baud. l)h. S. is archaic and often departs from 
the Panincan standard. Baudhayana employs such un-Paninean 
forms as "grhya" (for grlntva in II. 5. 1 ), pujya (II. 9. 5.), 
" adhigacchanah " ( in 11. 9. 9. ),. anayitva ( III. 3. 6 ), " punatha" 
( in 111. 6. 5, probably a quotation ), " tebhih " ( for taih in III. 2. 
16, la quotation ). In several places Baudhayana states opposite 
views and then gives his own opinion on the point, e. g. Baud. I. 5. 
105-109 (about impurity on biith ); II. 1. 19-51. 

As regards the literature known to Baudhayana the following 
points may be noted. All the four Yedas are mentioned by name 
in II. 5. 27 ( turpi! ija ). lie qtiotes very frequently the Taittiriya 
Samhita, Tai. Brahmana and die Tai. Aranyaka (in the Andhra recen- 
sion ). Well-known hymns of the Rgveda such as the Aghamar- 
sana, the Puuisastikta aiu! also simple € rks 9 are frequently referred 
to. In III- 10 ( which is almost the same as Gautama 19 ) there is 
a sutra enumerating the Upanisads, the Saiiihitas of all the Vcdas 
and several st'imaus a-, purificatory texts. There are long quotations 
taken from the Satapatha-brahmana (XT. 3. 3. 1 ffand XI. 5. 6. 3 ) 
in Baud. ( 1.2.52 about brahmacan and II. 6. 7-9 about brabmayajha ). 
It is noteworthy that in the tnrpaitii there is an invocation of the 






0. The Baudhayana Dliarmasutra 25 

Atharvaveda and immediately afterwards of the Atharvarigirasah. The 
same is found in the Baudhayanagrhya also (III. 2. 9 and 22). In the 
Upanisads(Brhadaranyaka II.4.10, IV. 1.2) it is the word Atharvangi- 
rasah that stands for the Atharvaveda. Baudhayana quotes a gathii of 
the Bhallavins (I. 1. 29 ) about the geographical limits of Aryavarta. 
Vasistha adduces the same verse (I. 15 ) and says that it is taken 
from the Nidana work of the Bhallavins. The Nirukta also mentions 
a school of Vedic interpretation called Naidanah. It is difficult to 
say what Nidana works contained. Itihasa and Parana occur in the 
tarpaiia (II. 5.27). The ufigas of the Vedas oecur in I. 1. 8 
and the six afigas in II. 8. 2. Whether the word " rahasya " in 
II. 8. 3 means the Aranyakas ( as Govindasvamin explains ) is 
doubtful. Baudhayana mentions a Vaikhanasa-sastra in II. 6. 16, 
which appears to refer to the work of Vikhanas on hermits and 
speaks of Sramanaka ( the rites prescribed by Vikhanas for initiation 
as hermit ), just as Gautama does. Among the authors on d karma 
mentioned by name are : Aupajanghani (II. 2. ^ for the view that 
only attrasa son was to be recognised and not the other kinds of 
sons'' 1 ), Katya ( I. 2. 47 ), Kasyapa ( or Kasyapa in other editions, 
I. 11. 20 on the point that a woman bought cannot be a patni), 
Gautama (1. 1. 23 and II. 2. 70 ), Prajapati (II. 4. 15 about failure 
in Sandhyopasana, and II. 10. 71 about saimyasa), Manu (IV. 1. 14 
and IV. 2. 16), Maudgalya (II. 2. 61, about observances of a 
widow being restricted only to six months after her husband's death), 
Hanta(II. 1. 50). Baud. I. 2. 7 quotes a verse, which Vasistha 
ascribes to Harita (Vas.ll. 6). As to Gautama, vide p. 17 above. Manu 
is only mentioned in the fourth prasna, the authenticity of which, as 
said above, is very doubtful. Baudhayana II. 2. 16 ( about the 
efficacy of Aghamar$aua ) closely agrees with Manu XL 260. The 
first reference to Manu's teaching cannot be traced in the Manusmrti. 
Prajapati ( in III. 9. 21 ) seems to stand for god Brahma and not for 
any real or mythical writer on dharma. One remarkable piece of 
information contained in Baudhayana (II. 6. 30 ) is that he quotes 
from a work ( of the Brahmana class in language ) a prose passage 
wherein the division into four asramas is ascribed to an asura Kapila, 
son of Pralhada. In II. 2. 79 Baudhayana quotes a galhd from the

dialogue between the daughter of Usanas and the king Vrsaparvan'*, 
which is nearly the same as Mahabharata I. 78. 10 and 34. Baud, 
quotes the view of Acaryas ( II. 6. 29 ) as Gautama does. In several 
places he refers to the views of his predecessors on dharma as 
" others " {eke, apare) e. g. I. 4. 23, I. 5. 16, I. 6. 105-106, II. 5. 2. 
In II. 3. 18 two verses in the Upajati metre are quoted as sung by 
" anna " ( food ). From the numerous quotations in verse cited by 
Baudhayana on topics of dharma, it follows that the Dharmasutra 
was preceded by a considerable number of works on dharma in verse. 
Biihler (SBH vol. XIV, p. XLIII) says that Vijnanesvara was the first 
writer who quoted the Baud. D. S. But there are writers who flourished 
centuries before Vijnanesvara that regarded Baudhayana as a writer 
on dharma and either quoted his words or pointedly referred to 
them. Sahara in his bhasya on Jaimini, I. 3. 3 says that the rule 
in the Smrtis about the period of Vedic study being 48 years is 
opposed to the Vedic injunction " one who has begot sons and 
whose hair are dark should consecrate the sacrificial fires?*." This 
must be regarded as referring to the words of Baudhayana (1.2. 1 ). 
Sahara uses the same word "Vedabrahmacarya" that Baud, employs. 
It is true that Gautama and Apastamba both refer to the rule about 
48 years, but they do not employ the word " veda-brahmctcarya . " 
The Tantravartikc of Kumarila says that the words of Apastan)ba 
(II. 6. 15. 1 ) which seem to accept the validity of local and family 
usages (even though opposed to Smrti tradition) stand refuted by the 
words of Baudhayana (I. 1. 19-24) who cites only such censured usages 
as are opposed to Smrti. Kumarila appears to think that Baudhayana 
attacks the extant work of Apastamba, i. e. the present Baud, is 
later than the present Apastamba. It is not necessary to follow

Kamarila implicitly as regards chronological details, where he is 
speaking of writers that flourished over a thousand years before him. 
But his opinion deserves weight. The Tantravartika quotes a Smiti 
passage which .bears a close resemblance to Baudhayana (II. 3.28)?*. 
In the commentary of Visvarupa ( who as we shall see below 
flourished about 800 A. D. ) on Yajnavalkya, Baudhayana is quoted 
at least nine times in the chapter on dcara alone. Vide Visvarupa on 
Yaj. I. 21, 26, 29, 53, 64, 69, 72, 79, 195 (Trivandrum edition), 
where Baud. L 5. 14, I. 2. 30, L 5. 5, I. 1. 17, IV. 1. 15, IV. 1. 18, 
IV. 1. 22, IV. 1. 20 and I. 5. 47 are respectively quoted. There 
are very few variations from the present text and the only serious 
variation is as regards the last (I. 5. 47 ) which is in prose ( while 
Visvarupa quotes a verse ). It is remarkable that Visvarupa quotes 
several verses from the fourth praina, which shows that even if the 
fourth prasna be an interpolation, it is comparatively an ancient one. 
The Mit. also (on Yaj. III. 306 ) quotes a long passage from the 
fourth prasna (IV. 1. 5-1 1 ). The words of the Sakuntala 76 that the 
first precept is that a girl is to be given away to a meritorious person 
are probably a reminiscence of Baud. IV. 1. 12. Medhatithi on 
Manu. V. 117 quotes Baudhayana L S» 47 and on IV. 36 quotes 
Baud. I. 4. 2 ( which is mutilated as printed). On Manu. V. 114 
he says that all the rules about purification of substances are con- 
tained in Baudhayana-smrti. On Manu. V. 118, he quotes 
Baud. I. 5. 50. 

About the home of Baudhayana it is diflicult to advance any posi- 
tive conclusion. In modern times Baudhayaniyas arc mostly confined 
to the south. We know that Sayana, the great commentator of the 
Vedas, was a Baudhayaniya. A grant of Nandivarma, a Pallava, of 
the 9th century mentions Brahmanas of the pravacana-sutra as reci- 
pients.77 As Baudhayana is called pravacanakara in the Grhya- 
sutras Buhler thinks ( S. B. E. vol. 14 p. xlii ) that the Brahmanas

belonged to the Baudhayanacarana. Buhler is probably right. In the 
grant most of the donees are students of the Apastamba Sutra. First 
the Gotra, then the Sutra and then the name of the donee are intro- 
duced in the grant. Therefore as some of the donees are said to be 
students of " pravacanasutra," it follows thai " pravacan a " stands 
for some sutra school. It appears that sutra and pravacana are two 
different things, whatever the latter term may mean. Baudhayana 
is called pravacanikara and Apastamba is styled sutrakara. We are 
told by the Baudhayana-grhysutra? 8 that a Hrahmana who studied 
sutra and pranr c a tut was styled " bhruna. " Buhler was inclined to 
hold that Baudhayana was a southern teacher for several reasons. 
Baudhayana mentions customs of the south and includes sea-faring 
as a custom peculiar to the north ( I. i. 20 ), while in another place 
he places sea-faring at the head of sins ([wtanlyas} lesser than the 
mortal ones ( II. 1. 41 ). Therefore it is said that he was not a 
northern teacher. But as against this we have to remember that 
Baudhayana ( I. 1 . 29 ) quotes with apparent approval a verse in 
which the countries of Avanti ( Ujjain ), Ariga, Magadha, Surastra 
( Kathiawar ) and Daksinapatha are declared to be the home of 
mixed castes. Daksinapatha was generally supposed to be the whole 
peninsula south of the Narmada. Baudhayana, if he was a native of 
the south, would nor lave spoken of his country as the home of 
mixed castes only, unless he put a restricted meaning on the word 
Daksinapaiha ( which sometimes meant in later days Maharastra ). 
Vide J. B. B. R. A. S. for 1917 p. 620. 

The extant Baiidhavanadharmasuira is certainly later than 
Gautama, as it mentions Gautama twice by name and as one quota- 
tion at least is found in the extant Gautama. Besides Baudhayana 
quotes by name several teachers on dhanna, while Gautama quotes 
only one, Manu. Baudhayana is far removed from the times of the 
Upanisads. Baud. ( II. 7. 1 5 ) quotes a verse which is itself an 
adaptation of a passage from the Clundogya-upanisad. ' 9 He

ft. The Baudhwjana Dharrmtutra 29 

quotes Harita. It is uncertain whether the Haritadharmasutra, a 
manuscript of which was discovered by the late Vaman &astri Islam- 
purkar at Nasik, is the one intended. Biihlcr thought that the work 
of Baudhayana was earlier than that of Apastamba by a century or 
two. His first reason was that Kanva Baudhayana receives homage 
in the larpiiija before Apastamba and Hiranyakesin and that the same 
order is observed in the Baudhayana-grhyasiitra. But this reason is 
far from convincing. It may be conceded that Baudhayana was 
regarded as the oldest (or the most authoritative or respectable) of the 
three schools of the Black Yajurveda. But from this it docs not at 
all follow that the extant dhwma-sfttra of the Baudliayanfyas is earlier 
than that of the Apastambtyas. For aught we know the sutra com- 
piled for the school of Baudhayana may be later than the sutra 
manual of the Apastambiyas. We saw above that orthodox opinion, 
represented by Kumarila, regards Baudhayana's work as later than 
Apastamba "s. All the three founders of the three schools are mentioned 
in the Baudhayanagrhya and dharma sutra. One may equally argue with 
good reason that both these works knew a sutra work of Apastamba 
and that the extant dharmasutra of Apastamba is that work. Another 
reason assigned for the priority of Baudhayana's work over Apastam- 
ba's is that, though both have numerous sutras that agree almost 
word for word, a comparison of the views of the two writers shows 
that Apastamba U\\s down stricter and more puritanic ( and there- 
fore later ) views on certain points than Baudhayana. Gautama, 
Baudhayana and Vasistha mention several secondary sons, while 
Apastamba is silent about them. Gautama, Baudhayana (II. 2. 17, 
62 ), Vasistha and even Visnu approve of the practice of myoga, 
while Apastamba condemns it ( II. 6. 13. 1-9). Gautama and 
Baudhayana (I. 11. 1) speak of eight forms of marriage, while 
Apastamba speaks of only six and omits Prajapatya and Paisaca 
(II. 5. 11. 17-20 and II. 5.12. 1-2 ). Baudhayana ( U. 2. 4-6 ) 
allowed a larger share to the eldest son on a partition, while Apa- 
stamba condemns such a procedure (II. 6. 14. 10-14). The 
Baudhayana-grhyasutra ( H. 4. 6 ) allows upanayana to mthakira, 
while Apastamba (grhya 4. 10. 1-4 ) does not do so ( dharmasutra 
I. 1. 1. 19 ). These points are hardly conclusive on the question of 
date. From very ancient times there was great divergence of opinion 
among the doctors of the law on most, if not on all, of these 
points. There is no hard and fast rule thjit these doctrines were up- 



30 History of Dharmai&tra 

held by early writers and condemned by later ones. Baudhayana 
himself quotes the views of an ancient writer, Aupajanghani, who con- 
demned all secondary sons. The verses that Baudhayana quotes on 
this point (IT. 2. n-36 ) are quoted by Apastamba also but with- 
out the author's name ( Ap. II. 6. 13. 6 ), there being variants only 
in the lirst verse, \i\oga was allowed by Manu (9. 56-63) and then 
condemned (9. 64-68) and Bl'haspati refers to this attitude of Manu 
( vide Kulluka on Manu 9. 68 ). Even so late a writer as Yajiia- 
valkya ( II. 131 ) approves of niyoga. About the rathakara being 
allowed to consecrate the sacred fires there is a discussion in the 
sutras of Jaimini (VI. 1. J4 ff). Vedic passages supported both 
methods vi\. equal division among sons and the bestowal of a larger 
share on the eldest. Even Yajnavalkya ( II. 118) allows a larger 
share to the eldest son. Therefore hardly anyone of the circumst- 
ances relied upon by Buliler as indicating a later age for Apastamba 
is conclusive or convincing. The third ground for placing Baudha- 
yana before Apastamba is that the style of the former is simpler and 
older as compared with the hitter's. That Baudhayana is simpler 
than Apastamba may be admitted. But this may be due to the fact 
that Baudhayana has been tampered with more than Apastamba. 
On the other hand Apastamba contains more un-Paninean forms 
more uncouth constructions, more words in an archaic sense than is the 
case with Baudhayana. All that is almost certain about the age of the 
Baudhayana-dharmasutra is that it is later than the work of Gautama, 
that its style, its doctrines and its general out-look on different sub- 
jects do not compel us to assign it a later date than that of the other 
dharmasutras. We have adduced evidenee to show that long before 
the days of Sahara (whose latest date cannot be later than 500 A.D.) 
the Baudhayana-dharmasutra was an authoritative smrti ; it follows 
that the dharmasutra must be placed somewhere between 500-200 
B. C. Numerous sutras are identical in Baudhayana and Apastamba 
e.g. Ap. I. r. 2. 10 = Baud. I. 2. 40- |i, Ap. I. 2. 6. 8-9 = Baud. 
I. 2. 39, Ap. I. 5. i). 8 = Baud. I. 2. 51, Ap. I. 11. 31. 11 and 16 = 
Baud. II. 5. 39and ^2. There are several verses that occur in both eg. 
Baud. II. 1. .(2 = Ap. I. 9. 27. 1 1, Baud. II. 2. 34-36 = Ap. II. 6. 
13. 6 ( three verses condemning secondary sons ), Baud. II. 10. 63 = 
Ap. 11. 9. 21. 10, Baud. II. 7. 22-23 = Ap. II. 4. 9- *3- (two 
verses), Baud. II. 6. 36.=Ap. II. 9. 24. 8. Besides these there are 
numerous Vedic quotations that are common to both. All this, 



6. The Baudhayana DharmaMtra 31 

however, does not establish anything about their relative position. 
The Vasistha-dharmasutra also has numerous quotations in common 
with Baud. Vide Vas. I. 15. = Baud. I. 1. 28, Vas. III. 5, 6, 
11, 20, 56 = Baud. I. 1. 10, 12, 11, 8 and I. 5. 58 ( respectively); 
Vas. 6. 20-21= Baud. II. 7. 22-23 > Vas - VIII. 17 = Baud. II, 2, r ; 
Vas. XL 27-28 == Baud. II. 8. 21-22 ; Vas. XVI. 34 = Baud. I. 10. 
35, Vas. XVII. 73 = Baud. IV. 1. 17, Vas. XVII. 86 = Baud. I. 5. 
102; Vas. XXII. 10 = Baud. I. 1- 33- It is to be noted that 
some of these quotations (Baud. II. 8. 21-22, I. ro. 35 ) occur 
in the extant Manusmrti also (III. 125-126 and VIII. 98). 
There are a few prose siitras in Vas. that are transformed 
into verse in Baud, and vice versa c. g. Vas. III. 41 (prose) = Baud. 
1. 5. 20 (quoted as a verse), Vas. III. 57 (quoted as a verse) 
= Baud. I. 6. 19-20. It is not likely that one borrows from the 
other. There are two other possible explanations, viz. that both 
Baud, and Vas. (and Manu also) quote from or adapt a common 
source or that the three works have been tampered with and inter- 
polations introduced at every step. The latter alternative is too 
sweeping as the number of verses is very large and makes all the old 
sutras except that of Gautama valueless for all chronological pur- 
poses. One cannot subscribe to the view that such extensive inter- 
polations took place as the latter theory demands. The first alter- 
native appears more reasonable. What thai common source was, 
whether it was a regular work in verse or whether there was a float- 
ing mass of such popular verses as Biihler holds, are questions that 
present very great difficulties. It is not easy to believe that there 
were hundreds of floating verses on dharma no body knew by whom 
composed, on which writers of the centuries preceding the Christian 
era drew for supporting their opinions. That does not sound as a 
very likely procedure. It is more probable that such verses were 
contained in a work or works now lost. lK\*PQ2 

In the tarpdija, Baud. (II. 5.21) mentions several appellations 
of Ganesa, viz. Vighna, Vinayaka, Sthula, Varada, Hastimukha,, 
V.ikratunda, Ekadanta, Lambodara. But this affords no certain clue 
as to date. The worship of Vinayaka is found in the Manavagrhya 
also. In the tarpana (II. 5. 25 ) we have the seven planets 
mentioned in the order of the days of the week and also Rahu and 
Ketu ; besides the twelve names of Visnu occur in 1J. 5. 24. 
In II. 1.44 Baud, speaks of the profession of an actor or of a 
teacher of dramaturgy ( Natyacarya ) as an upapataka, Several 



32 History of Dharmaiatlra 

sutras attributed to Baudhavana on the subject of adoption in the 
Dattakamimamsa and other later works are taken from the Baudhay- 
anagrhyasesasiitra ( IF. 6 ), the sutras agreeing very closely with 
Vasistha ( 15. 1-9 ). 

According to Burned the oldest commentator on the Baudhyana- 
srauta-sutra was Bhavasvamin, whom he placed in the 8th century. 
The commentary of Govindasvamin on ihe Dharmasfitra is a learned 
one and is generally to the point. He appears to he a very late 
writer. 

7. Dharmasulraof Apaslamba. 

This has been edited several times (n;. bvBiihler in the Bombay 
Sanskrit series with large extracts from Haradatta's commentary 
called Ujjvala and also at Kumbhakonam with the complete com- 
mentary of Haradatta and translated by Buhler witli an introduction 
in S. B. li. vol. II ). The Apastambakalpasutra of the Taittirlya 
Sakha of the black Yajurveda is divided into $opntimis. According 
to Buhler, the first 24 prasnas contain the treatment of Srauta sacrifices; 
the 25th contains pttribkixfts, pravarakhanda, and Hautraka prayers 
to be recited by Hotr priests ; 26th and 27th prainas constitute the 
Grhyasiitra, the 28th and 29th Dharmasutra and the 50th prasna 
is the Sulvasutra. Buhler seems to be slightly inaccurate here. 
According to Caundappa, who commented on the Apastambiva 
sutras in the 14th century, the Apastambiyamantrapatha forms the 
25th and 26th prasnas of the Kalpasutra and the G !*h yasutra forms 
27th prasna/ 11 The Srauta-siitra of Apastamba was edited by Dr. Garbe 
in the B.I. series; the Grhya and Mantrapatha were edited by 
Dr. Winternitx. The Grhya with the commentary ofSudarsanarya 
lias been edited in the Mysore Govt. Oriental series by Pandit 
Mahadeva Sastri ( in 1893 ). It is divided into eight pau'as and 
2 j khandas. According to the Caranavyulia, Apastamba (or "bluf 
as written in many southern mss.) is one of the five subdivisions 
of the Khandikiva school of the Taittiriyasakha of the Black Yajur- 
veda. Whether the author of the Apastambiya Srauta, Grhya and 
Dharma sutras is the same is difficult to determine. One sutra in 

so qr=qR?r«j ^w ^pwn: sqww \ m*tv mm ^\^^mmm: \\ 

( Dr. Winteraitz's edition of Ap. Mautrapatha p. IX). The editor further 
states ( p. IX n. 2 ) that Paribh&ra's form part oi the 24th prasna and 
pot of the 25th, as Buhler says. 



7. Dharmasuira of Apastumba 33 

the Apastambadharma (II. 2. 5. 17) is the same as Ap. Srauta 
(III. 17. 8 and VIII. 4. 6 ). OMenbcr- ( S. B. I:, vol. 30, p.XXXIl) 
does not subscribe to Btih!er\ view ( S. B. H. Vol. 1 [, pp. XIII-XIY ) 
that the authors of the Ap. Srauta and Dbarum were identical and 
gives it as his own view that another person of the same school 
might have imitated the style of the author of the Srauta. What- 
ever may be said of the identity of the authorship of the Srauta and 
Dharma sutras, theGrhya and Dharma seem to be very closely related 
and both seem to be the compositions of the same author. The 
Ap. Grhya sutra, as compared with the Asvalayana-^rhya or Gobhi- 
lagrhya, is extremely brief and leaves out main rules that are given 
in other Grhya works. l : or example, about the choice of a girl Ap. 
grhya gives only a single rule ( 1. 3. 19 S! ). While it is the 
Dharmasutra that tells us that the bride must not be sagotra nor 
sapitjtda (Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 1 1. 15-16). The Ap. Grhya issilent about 
the forms of marriage, abotit holidays, about the duties of brahma- 
carins and such other subjects which are generally treated of in 
other Grhyasutras. These subjects are dealt with in the Ap. Dh. S. 
and there are several places where the Dharmasutra presupposes 
the existence of the Gfhya and refers to it. Compare Ap. Dh. S. 
II. I, 1. io-ii * 2 with Ap. Gr. S. III. 7 ( particularly sutras 1, 17, 23 ). 
Vide note 54 above. Some sutras are identical in the Gfhya and 
Dharma, c. g. Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 2. 38 and Grhya IV. 1 1. 1 5-10 ( about 
the staff of Brahmacarin ) ; Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 8. 7 and Grhya V. 
13. 19. In some cases the Grhya-sutra itself seems to refer to the 
teachings of the Dharmasutra, e. g. Grhya 8. 21. 1 and Dharma II. 7. 
16. 6-7. All these facts make it highly probable, if not certain, that 
theGrhya and Dharma sutras were composed by the same author 
and that the details of certain topics were purposely omitted in the

including death sentence according to the gravity of the offences,

Stidra ; punishments for abuse and for homicide; punishments for 
various breaches of conduct ; dispute between cowherd and master ; 
the perpetrator, the abettor and one who approves of the act are 
all guilty ; who are to decide disputes; in case of doubt decision 
by inference and by divine proof ( ordeals); punishment for perjury; 
all other dharmas should be learnt, according to some, from women 
and people of alt castes. 

Each of the two prasnas of the Apastamba-dharma-siitra is divid- 
ed into eleven patalas, there being 32 and 29 khaijdikds in the two 
palalas respectively. The Dharmasutra is written in a more concise 
and compact style than that of Baudhayana and has more archaic 
and un-Paninean forms than any other extant Dharmasiitra. For 
example, the following are against the rules of Panini ; Adhasana 
( for adha asana ) in I. 1. 2. 21, aglariisnu ( I. 2. 3. 22 ), muhunsca 
( 1. 2. 8. 22), agrhyamana (I. 4. 12. 8), ^arvatopeta (for sarvata 
upeta) in I. 6. 19. 9, sakhim ( for sakhini ) in 1. 7. 21. 9. Hara- 
datta points out in many places that the current reading was un- 
Paninean and therefore he read differently ( e. g. in II. 2. 5. 2 he 
reads Siprakramana', while the current reading was 'viprakramina') 8 *. 
This makes it probable that in the original text there must have 
been many more un-Paninean forms than in the one preserved by 
Haradatta. There are many unfamiliar or rare words used by 
Apastamba, i. e. ananiyoga ( I. 6. 19. 12), anaisciirika ( I. 8. 22. 
1 J, Kartapatya ( I. 2. 5. 3 ), vyupatoda and vyupajava (-'pa' ) in 1. 
2. 8. 15, brahmahasamstuta ( I. 1. 1. 32). We meet with strange 
forms of certain words, such as paryanta (I. j. 9. 21 ), prasasta(II. 
8. 19. 3), anatyaya (I. 1. 1. 21 for anatyava ), brahmojjham 
( for -ojjhah ) in I. 7. 21. 8, svavit(i. 5. 17. 37), sthevana (I. n. 
30.19 for sthivana ), acarvadare ( for -daresu ) in I. 2.7.27. 
Though the Ap. Dlhtrmasfitra is mainly in prose, there are verses here 
and there. Some of the verses are expressly stated to be taken from 
other sources by being introduced with the word "udaharanti" or with 
"athapyudaharami" e. g. I. 6. 19. 13 (two slokas from a Purana), 
I. 6. 19. 15 ( compare Manu 8. ;r7 and Vas. 19. 44), I. 11. 3r. 1, 

I. 11. 32. 24, II. 4. 9. 13 (two verses, same as Baud. II. 7. 22-23 ), 

II. 7. 17. 8, II. 6. i}. 6 (three verses almost the same as in Baud. 
II. 2. 34-36), II. 9. 23. 4-5 (two slokas from a Purana ). 
Besides these there are several isolated verses, most of which 



98 History cf DharmaiUstra 

seem to be quotations, though not introduced with words like 
"udaharanti". They are L 4. 14. 25, I. 6. 19. 14 ( the first pada of 
which is Manu 4. 212), I. 9. 27. 10, I. 9. 27. 11 (same as Baud. II. 1. 
42), II. 2. 4. 14 ( compare Manu III. roi). Some of these verses 
are defective in metre, there being nine syllables in one anustubh 
pada as in 1. 9. 27. to, II. 9.23.4-5, II. 2. 4. 14. One of the 
verses is in the classical Upajati metre (IT. 7. 17. 18 ), while 
another closely approaches that metre ( I. 9. 27. n ). Besides these 
there are a few half-verses, II. 5. 1 1. 5-6 (same as latter half of 
Vanaparva 133. 1), IT. 9. 2T. 10 (Manu 6. 43 lias the first pada). 
Thus in all there are about twenty verses, of which at least six occur 
in Baudhayana. Some sutras that are printed as prose are parts ot 
verses, e. g. I. 2. 5. 11. Besides these there are several verses in the 
■ patalas dealing with metaphysics (1.8. 22. 4-8 and r. 9. 23. 1-3 ) 
that are pieced together largely from Upanisad passages. Apastamba in 
several places employs the first person plural about himself 84 , e. g. 
I. 1. 1. 27, I. 8. 22. 3, I. 8. 23- 4. Haradatta points out that hi 
his day there was difference in the text as handed down in Northern 
and in Southern India. * 5 

Apastamba quotes, besides the Stnhhitiis, the Brahmanas very fre- 
quently (c. g., I. 1. t. 10-11, I. i. 3. 9, I. 1. 3. 26, I. 2. 7. 7, I. 2, 
7. 11, I. 3. 10. 8). He quotes the Yajasaneyaka ( I. 5. 17. 31 ) 
and the Yajasaneyi-brahmana (I. 4. 12. 3 on svadhyaya ), he speaks 
of the Upanisads ( II. 2. 5. 1 ), his quotations (IT. 2. 3.16-II. 2. 4, 
1-9 ) from the Tai. Aranyaka agree, according to Triihler, with the 
text current in the Andhra country. He speaks of the six afigas of 
the Veda (II. 4. 8. 10 ) and in the next sutra enumerates Chandas, 
Kalpa, grammar, Jyotisa, Nivukta, Siksa, ( phonetics ) and 
Chandoviciti ( metrics ), which are seven ( Siksa being probably 
intended to be included in grammar). There ..re passages in Apa- 
stamba which agree with theNirukta, e. %. <hr definition of acarya 86 . •

39 7. Dharmastttra of Apastamba 

He quotes the views of ten writers on dhartna by name, viz. Eka 
( I. 6. 19. 7 ) 3 Kanva ( I. 6. 19. 3 and I. 10. 28. 1 ), Kanva ( I. 6. 19. 
7 ), Kunika ( I. 6. 19. 7 ), Kutsa ( I. 6. 19. 7 ), Kautsa ( I. 6. 9. 4 
and 7, 1. ro. 28. 1 ), Puskarasadi (I. 6. 19. 7, L 10. 28. t), 
Varsyayani ( I. 6. 19. 5 and 8, 1. 10. 28. 2 ), Svetaketu ( I. 4. 13. 19 
and I. 2. 5. 6 ), Harita ( l\ 4. 13. 11, I. 6. 18. 2, I. 6. 19. 12, I. 10. 
28. i, 5 and 16, I. 10. 29. 12 and 16). Some of the names 
( viz. Kautsa, Varsyayani, and Puskarasadi ) occur in the Nirukta. 
He quotes the view of Svetaketu in Svetaketu's own words 
(in I. 4. 13. 20 ) that even a married man should ever}' 
year stay with his teacher for two months to refresh his studies 
and gives it as his own opinion that Svetaketu's view is opposed to 
the Sasiras ( the Vcdas ). In another place ( I. 1. 4. 5-6 ) he speaks 
of Svetaketu as an avara ( a person belonging to later ages ) and as 
■>ne who on account of the remnant of his meritorious actions done 
m a iormer life or lives was able to «rasp the four Vedas in a short 
rime. It i* usual to sit in this a reference to Svetaketu in the 
Chandogya Upanisad (VI. «• 1-2% where it is stated that Sveta- 
ketu mastered all the Vcdas in twelve years. But this identification 
is somewhat of doubtful value. Apastamba quotes Svetaketu as a 
teachti ofdlmnna. The quotation from Svetaketu given by Apas- 
tar-iba has nothing corresponding to it in the Upanisad. Besides 
the Chandogya Upanisad appears to make a distinction between 
two Svetaketu's ( in VI. 1 and VI. 8), one being called Aruneyaand 
the other Aruni (son of Aruna). llama, whose views arc cited so 
frequently, is quoted by Baudhayana ( [[. 1. 50 ) and also by 
Vasistha ( II. 6. ) . From the two sutras (I. 6. 19. 3 and 7 ) it 
follows that Kama and Kanva arc two distinct writers. The Kum- 
bhakonam edition reads Kanva in I. 10. 28. 1, while Buhlcr reads 
Kanva there. Kan\a Bodhayana is a teacher, whose, name occurs 
in the rfilttrpttijtf in many works. The view ascribed to Kanva by 
Apastamba in J. (>. 19. 7 stems to be the same as that 
of the Biiudhayaii.i-dharmasutra (I. 2. 19 s *' ). It has been shown 
above that there are close parallels in thought and expression

4A titeory <f Llumotttra 

between Baudhayana and Apastamba. In several places Apastamba 
seems to be controverting the views of Baudhayana or similar views 
held by others. Apastamba condemns the view of giving the 
paternal wealth to the eldest son as opposed to the Vedas and 
explains the Vedic text (Tai. S. II. 5. 2. 7 quoted above) about 
the eldest son being endowed with all wealth as a mere anuvdda and 
and not a vidhi ( vide Ap. Dh, S. II. 6. 14. 6-13 ). Baudhayana 
cites both the texts of the Tai. S. about equal division among sons 
and about the eldest son's larger share and seems to favour the latter 
view by putting it last ( II. 2. 2-7. ). Similarly the discussion in 
Apastamba ( 1. 1. 4. 5-12 ) about a brahmacarin eating the leadings 
( ucchisja ) of his guru, provided the things are not 
directly forbidden by Sruti, seems to be directed against Baudhayana 
(II. 1.25-26). Although Apastamba does not expressly quote 
Gautama, he appears to have had before him the Gautama-dharma- 
sutra. He speaks of a smrti ( II. 6. 13. 25 ) that lays down that 
upanayana confers adhikara on a man for sastric actions and that 
before upanayana one is free to do anything and to eat anything. 
This, as interpreted by Haradatta, refers to Gautama ( II. 1 ) 88 . 
There are striking coincidences between Gautama and Apastamba, 
e. g. Gaut. I. i9.=Ap. I. 1. 1. 41 (about some teachers prescribing 
the yellow robe to a brahmacarin ), Gaut. I. 3 = Ap. 11. 6. 13. 7 
( about the violation of dharma by the great in former ages ), Gaut. 
9. 52=Ap. 1. 11. 31. 13 ), Gaut. 23. 9= Ap. 1. 9. 25. 2; Gaut. 16. 19 
- Ap. I. 31 9. 14-15 ). Apastamba frequently refers to the views 
of his predecessors in the words ' eke ' ( I. 1. 2. 37, 38, 41 : f. 1. 4. 
17 J I- 2. 5. 20; I. 2. 6.4: I. 3.9. 3 : 1. 3. 11. 3&c.)and 'aparam' 
( II. 6. 15. 22 ). It is somewhat remarkable that in many of these 
cases ( where c eke ' occurs ), the views are those either held by 
Gautama or ascribed by him also to others, e. g. Ap. I. 1. 2. 3*8 
about the staff of a brahmacarin refers to Gaut. I. 23; Ap. I. 1. 2. 41 
is almost same as Gaut. 1. 19, Ap. I. 2. 5. 20 seems to refer to Gaut. 
*• S4"59> Ap. 1. 3. 9. 3 (the view of some that Vedic study lasts 
for four months and a half ) seems to refer to Gaut. 16. 2, and Ap. 
I. 3. 11. 3 ( about not studying after dining at a sacrifice for deities 
that are manusya-prakrti ) pointedly refers to Gaut. 16. 34 which 
contain s the word < manusyayajnabhojana \ Apastamba twice

quotes verses from a;Purana\( I. 6. 9. 13, II. 9. 23. 3 ) and in one 
place gives in prose the view of a Purana ( 1. 10. 29. 7. ) 8 *. 
Apastamba (II. 9. 24. 6 ) speaks of the view of a Bhavisyat- 
pur|pa ( about creation of the world after a periodic dissolution )• 
In one place Apastamba (II. 11. 29. 11-12) says that 'the knowledge 
that exists ( traditionally ) among women and sudras is the furthest 
limit of vidya and it is said to be a supplement of the Atharvaveda/ 
Here he probably refers to Arthasastra, which according to the 
carapavyuha, is the Upaveda of the Atharvaveda. Apastamba 
refers ( II. 7. 16. i ) to Manu as founder of tho institution of sraddha. 
But this appears to be a reference to Manu, the mythical progenitor 
of mankind, and not to the Manusmrti. It is noteworthy that 
Apastamba ( II. 7. 17. 8 ) quotes a verse, which is the same as 
Anusasanaparva 90. 46 ( sambhojanl nama &c. ). 

The Apastambadharmasutra stands in a peculiar relation to the 
Pflrvamimamsa. It is the only exunt Dh?rmasutra that contains 
many of the technical terms and doctrines of the Mimamsa. He 
says ( I. 1. 4. 8 ) ' a positive Vedic text is more cogent than an 
usage which merely leads to an inference ( of its being based on a 
Vedic text now lost 9° ).- This refers to Jaimini's rule (I. 3.3) 
" if there is a conflict between an express Vcdic text and Smrti, the 
latter is to be disregarded : but if there be no conflict an inference 
( may be made that the Smrti is based upon some Sruti )". In 
another place Apastamba says ( 1. 4. 12. 11) 'where an action is 
done on account of finding pleasure therefrom ( i. e. from a worldly 
motive ), there is no (inference of its being based on)&astra\ 
This is the same as Jaimini's teaching (IV. 1. 2 ) 9 \ He speaks of the 



nr 1. 10. 29. 7; this seems to be a summary of a verse like the one in 
Baudhffyana ( Dh. S. 1. 10. 12 ) and Vasis^ha ( HI. 18 ) « ^tfajf^f £$

convention ( sawaya ) of those who know Nyaya ( i. e. Mim&ihsa) 
that aftgas ( such as the Kalpasutras are ) cannot be designated the 
Vedas ( which are the principal ), which is clearly a reference to 
Ptirvamlmamsa (I. 3. 11-14)^ and he says that those who know 
Nyaya lay down that a mere anuvdda (affirming or reciting J of 
what is well-known to all is not a positive rule ( a vidbi), which is 
similar to Jaimini's rule?*. The dictum of Apastamba that the word 
" sale " ( kraya ) applied to a bride in some Vedic texts is merely 
figurative closely resembles Jaimini's* 4 remarks on the same point. 
The remark of Apastamba that the rules of anadhy&ya only apply to 
Vedic study and not to the recital of mantras at sacrifices corresponds 
to a rule in jaimini" almost in the same words. These examples 
show that in Apastamba's day Mimamsa doctrines had been far 
advanced and that works existed that dealt with Mimamsa topics 
( Nyayas ). The correspondence in language with the Purva- 
mimamsasutra is so close that one is tempted to advance the view thit 
Apastamba knew the extant Mimaihsa-sutra or an earlier version of 
it that contained almost the same expressions. It cannot be said 
that all these passages are later interpolations. They have all been 
explained by Haradatta and one of the sutras referring to Mimamsa 
topics occurs in so early a work as the commentary of Vifivarupa 
(on Yaj. 1.7) who quotes "Brahmanokta vidhayah". (Ap. 1. 4. 12. 10). 
The last passage is quoted by Medhatithi also ( on Manu II. 6 ). 

The dharmasutra of Apastamba has been quoted from very 
ancient times as authoritative. Sabara in his bha$ya on Jaimini 
VI. 8. 18 quotes one sutra of Apastamba and a paraphrase of another.* 6

family usages,'? about drinking wine and about the conflict between • 
the views of Baudhayana and Apastamba ( vide above page 26 also ). 
SaAkartdtrya in his bbajya on Brahmasutra IV. 2. 14 quotex 
Apastamba I. 7. 20, 3 ( about the planting of trees for fruit as a 
meritorious act and the collateral benefits of shade and fragrance ). 
He also cites (on Brahmasutra II. 1. 1. ) about the supreme soul a 
half verse from Apastamba (I. 8. 23. 2 )* 8 . In his bhasya on 
Bfhadaranyaka, he cites Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1 ( upasane gurunam 
&c. ). The two pafalas of Apastamba (I. 8. 22 and 23) 
dealing with adhyatma (philosophy) were commented upon 
by Saflkaracarya, who, from the general style and method 
of the commentary ( vide Trivandrum edition of the adhyat- 
mapatala ), seems to be the same as the great acarya. 
SureSvara in his Vartika ( I. 1 . 97 ) on Saftkara's hhafya on the Bpha- 
daranyakopanisad quotes the sutra about the planting of mango 
( Apastamba I. 7. 20. 3 " ) trees. Visvarupa, who according to 
Madhava, was the same as Suresvara, 100 quotes (Trivandrum 
edition) in his commentary on Yajiiavalkya (acara and vyavahara only) 
Apastamba's sutras about twenty times. The quotations show that 
the text of Apastamba was identical with the one printed, barring a 
few variations that are no more than mere slips on the part of the 
scribes of Mss. In his commentary on Yaj. Ill 237 Visvarupa 
quotes eighteen sutras of Apastamba (I. 9. 24. 6-23 ) consecutively 
which are the same as those in the printed text. Medhatithi quotes 
Apastamba II. 5. n. 2, II. 4. 7. 16, II. 8. 19. 20, I. 4. 14. 30-31 on 
ManuII. 247, III. 102, III. 273 and VIII 357 respectively and 
appears to refer to Apastamba I. 4. 13.6 (about "om") on Manu 
II. 83. The Mitaksara has several quotations and Apararka contains

about two hundred siitras of Apastamba, though rather in a mutilated 
form. But it is hot necessary to refer to these and other later works in 
detail, since Haradatta's commentary, as will be shown later on, 
was written about the time of Apararka. Thus from the days of 
Sahara ( 500 A. D. at the latest) to 1100 A. D. we have a host of 
writers who vouch for the authenticity of the extant text of 
Apastamba. 

About the home and personal history of Apastamba little is known. 
Apastamba is not an ancient name. It does not occur in the Vedic 
texts. It occurs in the gatjti "Bidadi" in Panini IV. 1. 104. He 
speaks of himself as belonging to later ages (avard*). Vide Apa- 
stamba 101 I. 2. 5. 4. and II. 6. 13. 9. In the tarpaya he is generally 
mentioned after Bodhayana and before Satyasadha HiranyakeSin 
(vide note 68a above). Therefore according to tradition his school was 
elder or more authoritative than that of Hiranyakesin. In one place 
Apastamba refers to a peculiar sraddha usage of the udlcyas (II. 7. 
17. 17 ). 102 Apastamba must be supposed to have embodied in his 
work the usages of his own country. If he specially mentions the 
usages of a particular locality, it would follow that he did not hail 
from that locality. But the exact meaning of " Udicya " is doubtful. 
Haradatta quotes a verse of the grammarians, according to which the 
country north of the Sar«Vati was called "Udicya". According to 
the Maharnava quoted in the commentary on the caranavyuha the 
Apastambiyas were to be found to the south of the Narmada, in the 
south-east, that is, in Andhra and the territory about the mouth of 
the Godavari. Therefore it is natural to suppose that Apastamba's 
school had its origin in the south and probably in Andhra. The 
Pallavas made land grants to Apastambiyas. Vide I. A. vol. V. 
page 155. 

The age of the Apastamba-dharmasutra can be settled within only 
approximate limits. It is probably later than the Gautama Dharma- 
sutra and also the Baudhayayanadharmasutra and before 500 
A. D. it was an authoritative smpi work according to Sahara. Apa- 
stamba is enumerated by Yajnavalkya as a writer on dharma ( I. 5 )

and by Saftkha-Likhita. Its style and grammar ( which is un* 
Paninean in the extreme ) entitle it to great antiquity. There is no 
clear reference to Buddhism and other schisms anywhere. It appears 
to look upon Svetaketu as not far removed from its own epoch. It 
was probably written at a time when Jaimini had founded his school. 
Hence we shall not be far wrong if we assign it to some period 
between 600-300 B. C. On several points his views are opposed 
to those of his predecessors, e. g. he rejects secondary sons, 
condemns tiiyoga y does not admit Paisaca and Prajapatya as valid 
forms of marriage ( vide above page 29 ). There are other points 
also wherein Apastamba differs from Gautama and the other sfitra- 
karas. Gautama ( IV. 14-17 ) and Baudhayana (I. 8. 7-12) give long 
lists of mixed castes and Gautama includes Yavana among them. 
Apastamba is silent on this point. But this has hardly any bearing 
on chronology. Even the Vedic works mention the Nisada and the 
Purvamimamsasutra has a special adhikarana ( VI. 1. 51 ) devoted 
to him ; the Br. Upanisad mentions ( IV. 3. 22 and 37) such castes 
as Candiila, and the Gita mentions the Svapaka. The Ap. Srauta 
speaks of the Nisada ( 9. 14. 12-13 )• The Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 1. 2. 6 ) 
mentions Qndala, Paulkasa and Vaina. Gautama ( 17. 30 ) 
forbids the eating of the flesh of cows and bulls, 
while Ap. (I. 5. 7. 30-31) seems to allow it and cites the 
Vajasaneyaka for support. In this connection it has to be noted that 
Vasisfha also has a similar sutra (14. 46). Ap. (1. 9. 27, 10) prescribes 
a penance for one who practises usury and lays down that one 
should not eat at the usurer's ( I. 6. 18. 22 ), while Gautama appears 
to allow usury to a Brahmana as a calling if done through an agent 
(X. 6). Baudhayana, on the other hand, quotes verses that condemn 
usury in strong language as even worse than brahmahatya, holds 
that a Brahmana who is a usurer should be treated as a Sudra and 
allows the first two castes to practise usury only towards atheists, 
sudras and such like persons (I. 5. 79-81 ). So these differences 
of Ap. from others are hardly conclusive as to his chronological 
position. i|r 

The commentary of Haradatta called Ujjvala-vrtti is the only 
one so far recovered. For an account of Haradatta, vide sec. 86. The 
Smrticandrika (I, page 25) quotes a passage from the bh&$ya of 
Apastamba (II. 6. 15. 19-20) and (II. p. 300) quotes the explanation 
of the bha§yakara on Apastamba II. 6 14. 1. Both these passages 



are not found in the commentary of Haradatta, though in the latter 
case, Haradatta 'holds the same view as that of the Bhasyakara. 
Similarly the Viramitrodaya ( Vyavahara, page 671 ) quotes the 
bha§yakara of Apastamba, but that quotation does not agree with 
Haradatta. Haradatta himself does not call his work bhdsya, but 
Vftti. Besides the Subodhini on the Mitaksara (on Yaj. II. 13a) 
quotes a passage [from the Apastambadharmavrtti which is found 
in Haradatta on Ap. II. 6. 14. 1. Haradatta himself cites sometimes 
two or three other interpretations of the same sutra ( e. g. on Ap. I. 
a. 5. 2 ; I. 3. 10. 6 ; I. 5. 15. 20; II. 2. 3. 16). So the bfjOfyakdra 
was probably one of his predecessors. 

In Apararka, Haradatta, Smrticandrika and other works there are 
numerous quotations in verse ascribed to Apastamba. These 
quotations are concerned with topics of Ahnika, Sraddha, and Praya- 
scitta. The Smrticandrika ( III. pp. 423 and 426 ) quotes a Stotra- 
pastamba. Haradatta on Gautama (22. 18 ) quotes several verses on 
prayascitta from Apastamba. Three of these verses are found in 
the Apastamba-smrti in verse (Jivananda's collection vol. I pp. 
567-584 chap. I verses 16, 19, 31). The Smrti printed by 
Jivananda contains ahout 207 verses in ten chapters on prayascitta 
and purifications. But the quotations from the Smrticandrika and 
Apararkra show that the verse Apastamba was a much larger work 
and since they regarded the versified work as equally authoritative 
with the sutra work, the versified smrti must have been compare* 
tively an ancient work. 

8. Hiranyakesi-dharmasutra. 

• 

The Hiranyakesi-dharmasutra forms the 26th and 27th pralnas 

of the Hiranyakesi-kalpa. The Srauta sQtra has been published by 

the AnandaSrama Press ( Poona ). The Hiranyakesi-grhya-sutra was 

edited with extracts from the commentary of Matrdatta by 

Dr. Kirste (Vienna, 1889 ). The Grhya forms the 19th "and 20th 

prainas of the Kalpa, each prahna being divided into eight patalas. 

The Srauta-sutra is largely based on the Srauta-sutra of Apastamba. 

The Grhya-sntra is indebted to the Grhya-sutra of Bharadvaja. The 

DharniasfltraofHirai.iyakesin can hardly be called an independent 

work. Hundreds of sutras are borrowed word for word from the 

Apastamba Dharmasutra. The Dharmasutra of Hiranyakesin is 

therefore the oldest voucher for the authenticity of Apastamba's text 

and is very valuable for checking the latter, 



8. M trawMi fi hartmmtttra if 

The Hiranyakesins form a sutra-carana of the Khandikeya section 
of the Taittiriya&kha and were formed later than the Apastambiya 
School. In a grant of the Kongu kings dated in 454 A. D. 
Brahmaoas of the HiranyakeSi School are mentioned ( I. A. vol. V. 
page 136 ). According to the Maharnava quoted in the commentary 
of the caraijavytiha, the Hiranyakesins were to be found in the 
south-west between the Sahya mountain and the ocean and near 
ParaSurama ( i. e. in the Konkan ). There are at present many 
Brahmanas in the Ratnagiri District who call themselves Hiranya- 
kesins, The Dattaka-mimamsa of Nanda-pandita twice quotes pass- 
ages from the commentary of Sabarasvamin on the siitra of Satyasadha. 
If he was identical with the great commentator of the Purva-mlmamsa 
( which is almost certain ), then we have unimpeachable evidence 
for the existence of the works of the Hiranyakesins long before the 
fifth century A. D. 

Bflhler in his second edition of the Apastamba-dharmasutra 
( 1893 ) gave ( in appendix 11 ) the various readings of the Hirai.iya- 
kesi-dharmasiitra from two MSS. I secured a modern transcript of the 
Hiranyakesi-dharmasutra from theDeccan College collection ( No 138 
of 1881-82 ), which contains the text and also the commentary of 
Mahadeva thereon. There are 18 folios for the sutra and 101 for 
the commentary. That ins. presents some readings which arc not 
noticed by Biihler as found in the two inss. consulted by him. For 
example, the ms. reads " saptama ayuskamama§tame brahmavarca- 
sakamam (reversing the order of years in Ap. I. 1. 1. 21-22), 
omits the words '* yadi snayat dandavat plavet' (fromAp. I. 1. 
2. 30. ), reads 'vastranyeva vasitobhaya &c. ' ( Ap. I. 1. 3. 9 omits 
vasita ), reads * gurave ' for c acaryaya ' in Ap. I. 1. 3. 31. The 
nis. of the Hiraiiyakesi-dharmasutra contains certain additions to the 
sotras of Apastamba. For example, a sutra c k§aralavaga-madhu- 
mamsani ca varjayet' is added after Ap. II. 9. 22. 14, a stitra 
*te$am puja sreyasyatmanalj karya' occurs after Ap. II. 9. 25. 8, 
and the siitra f sarva-dharmariam svadharmanu§thananiyame§u ca 
yuktafe syat ' occurs after Ap. II. 9. 2$. i}. The manuscript con- 
tains a few verses, that are not found in the Apastambadharmasatra, 
introduced by the words 'athapyudaharanti 103 ,' (except in one case 



105 < q\jqtq ipR(Pn 3WT ^TRW^ (35)^ 1 <^*n^R % q*% cfsg^TFC^Fft- 



48 Bi*m €f Lharmatadra 

viz. ' putrena, &c. ) The manuscript also omits certain sQtras found 
in Ap. e. g. f varnajyayasam cetarair varnaib' (Ap. II. 5.11.8), 
' anyatra rahudarsan.it ' ( Ap. II. 7. 17. 25 ), ' athopanayanam tata 
udakopasparsanam ' ( Ap. I. 1. 1. 36. ). In the case of some sutras 
the readings of Hiranyakesin present a smoother and more classical 
Sanskrit than that of Apastamba and are manifestly attempts to bring 
them in a line with the requirements of the sisfas at the time when 
the Apastambasutras were taken over into the Hiranyakesi school. 
Hiranyakesisutra has 'padonam' and 'ardhonam' for 'padunam' and 
'ardhena' of Apastamba ( 1. 1. 2. 13-14 ), 'asandarsane' for 'asandarse' 
(Ap. I. 1. 2. 29), 'aglanih' for 'aglamsnuh' ( Ap. I. 1. 3. 22 ), 
'praksalayet' for 'praksalaylta' ( Ap. I. 1. 3. 36 ), 'kartrpatyam' for 
'kartapatyam' ( Ap. I. 2. 5.3) 'yathasakti* for 'Saktivisayena' ( Ap. 
II. 5. 12. 1 ). Another noticeable feature is that the arrangement of 
the sutras into subsections is a good deal different in the two works. 
Bflhler notes that from the 13 th khandika (6th patala) of the 
second prasna both the manuscripts consulted by him do not indicate 
the pafalas. The Deccan College manuscript does not number them 
from the second patala in the second prasna. The number of patalas 
in the first praina of Hiranyakesi is eight, while Apastamba has eleven 
patalas in each of the two prainas. The distribution of sutras in the 
khapdikas is therefore different in the two works. Hiranyakesi has 3 1 
khandikas in the ri m prasna and 20 in the second . Besides a few of the 
khandikas are differently placed. The first khandika of Hiranyakesi 
( first praina ) stops after Ap. I. 1. 2. I, the third reaches up to Ap. 
I. 1.4. 6; Ap. I. 8. 22 and 23 (the adhyatmapajala ) come in 
Hiranyakesi immediately after Ap. I. 6. 19 and are Hirartya. 1. 6. 20 ;

Hir. I. 8. 30. In the second praina the variance in distribution of 
stttras into khandikas is still greater. Besides Ap. II. 4. 8-9 are 
placed in Hiranyakesi before Ap. II. 3. 6-7 and Ap. II. 6. 13-15 
before Ap. II. 5. 10-n. Sometimes a single sutra of Apastamba is 
split up into two and placed in two different khandikas, e. g. Ap. 1. 
9. 25. 4 is split into Hir. I. 6. 23. 31 and I. 7. 24. 1 (the portion 
from 'rajanam gatva* being the first sutra of Hiranyakesi's 24th 
Khandika. 

The com. of Mahadeva Diksita called Ujjvala, is almost word for 
word the same as that of Haradatta's Ujjvala. That one has borrowed 
from the other admits of no doubt and Buhler thinks that Mahadeva 
is the borrower. But there is hardly anything to turn the scale in 
favour of Haradatta. Sometimes Mahadeva's commentary contains 
more matter than Haradatta's ( e. g. on thesutras ' Saptame brahma- 
rcasakamam &c, c Upanayanam vidyarthasya srutitah ', ' dvadasa- 
varardhyam ') and sometimes Haradatta contain more explanation 
( e. g. on c tasminsca vidyakarmantam &c. ; on ' napsu slaghamanafct 
snayat', on 'panisamksubdhenodakenaika Sec. 9 ). Mahadeva differs from 
Haradatta's explanation of the word 'atha', which the former takes 
in the sense of ' anantarya or adhikara ', while the latter takes it 
only in the sense of ' anantarya'. That Mahadeva also is an early 
writer follows from the fact ( noted by Buhler p. 1 i7n ) that por- 
tions of his commentary are contained in the Munich Ms. of Hara- 
datta dated Vikrama-Samvat 1668(1611-12 A. D. ). It is to be 
notld that Haradatta after saluting Ganesa at the beginning of his 
Ufivala does obeisance to Mahadeva ( which may mean God Siva or 
the author Mahadeva if he was the guru or father of Haradatta ). 
Mahadeva often comments on the sutras as found in Apastamba and 
not on the readings of them as existing in the Hiranyakesi school ; 
e. g. he comments on ' padunam \ on ( adhasanasayi ' for ardhasana- 
&yl ( the reading of the sQtra ), on ' atmasvastyayanarthena ' ( Ap. 
II. 5. 11. 9) for c svastyayanarthena ' of the ms. of Hir. The 
explanations of the two writers sometimes differ, as for example 
on ' acaryadhinas syad-anyatra pataniyebhyab ' ( Ap. I. 1. a. 19 104 ). 
One more circumstance that is worthy of note is that the Ujjvala of 
Haradatta does not contain many quotations from Smpis as com-

pared with his commentary on the Gautamadharmasiitra. .Although 
one may be inclined to hold that it is Mahadeva who borrows, it must 
be clearly recognized that there is hardly any positive evidence in 
support of such a view. There is a commentary called Vaijayanti 
on the Hiranyakesi-srauta-sutra. This Mahadeva is very likely 
identical with the Mahadeva who commented upon the dharmasutra. 

9. Vasistha-dharmasutra. 

This dharmasutra has been printed several times. The collection 
of Jivananda (part II, pp. 456-496 ) contains only 20 chapters and 
a portion of the 21st and so does the collection of Mr. M. N. Dutt 
(Calcutta 1908 ). The Anandasrama collection of smrtis ( 1905, pp. 
187-231 ) and the edition of Dr. Fuhrer in the B. S. series ( 1916 ) 
contain thirty chapters. According to Dr. Jolly ( R. u S., p. 6 ) 
some mss. give only six or ten chapters. The Vasisthadharmasutra 
with the commentary called Vidvanmodini was printed at Benares. 
In the following Dr. Fuhrer's edition has been used. 

Kumarila ( vide note 55 above ) tells us that the dharmasutra of 
Vasistha was specially studied by the students of the Rgveda, but 
that along with other dharmasutras it is authoritative for all caraitas. 
No srauta and grhya sutras of Vasi§tha, if they ever existed, have 
come down to us. We have therefore to fall back upon one of two 
hypotheses, vi[. either the dharmasutra of Vasistha is the solitary 
remnant of a school that might have once possessed a complete 
kalpa or that it was composed as an independent work on dharma 
and was subsequently seized upon by the students of the Rgveda, 
who had only srauta and grhya sutras of Asvalayana. For reasons 
given elsewhere I incline to the latter view. The dharmasutra of 
Vasi§tha cites quotations from all Vedas and beyond the name 
Vasistha there is hardly anything special in the dharmasQtra to 
connect it with the Rgveda. It is true that in the 17th chap, several 
verses of the Rgveda ( such as I. ai. 5, 1. 124. 7, V. 4. 10 which 
occur in sutras, 3, 16 and 4 respectively ) and several passages from 
the story of Sunahsepa in the Aitareyabrahmapa are quoted by the 
sfltra and that several hymns of the Rgveda, such as the asyavdmfya 
( Rg. '• 164 ), havispantiya ( Rg. X. ' 88 ), Aghamanana ( X. 190 ), 
are referred to in the 26th chap. But there is nothing remarkable 
in this as some of the verses and snktas are mentioned in the Bau- 
dhayana&armastitra also. Besides the Vas. Dh. S. quotes mw\ 



9m rott^M'MonfuulBtn SI 

passages from the Taittiriyasaihhita ( as in Vas. V. 7-9, which quotes 
Tai. S. II. 5. 1. 6 and Vas. XI. 48 which quotes Tai. S. VI. 3. 10. s), 
the Satapatha-brahmaija, the Maitrayniya-sariihita ( in Vas. I, 37 ). 

The contents of the Vas. Dh. S. are :— I Definition of Dhartna,

The Vas. Dh. S. resembles in several respects the other dharma- 
slltras described above. It contains almost the same subjects and is 
s\m\\2ttYy composed in prose interspersed with verses. The Vas. 
D\i. S. is in style like the Gautamadharmasutra and has many sutras 
identical with or closely resembling those of the latter. Vide. p. 18 
above. It has also several sutras closely corresponding with the 
sutras of Baudhayana. Grave doubts have been entertained about 
the authenticity of the whole of the text of the Vas. Dh. S. as the 
mss. contain varying numbers of chapters from 6 to 30, and as 
the text is hopelessly corrupt in several places ( e. g. vide note 108 
below ). The Vas. Dh. S. contains many verses which bear the 
impress of a comparatively late age. Chapters 25-28 are entirely 
in verse, while there are other chapters ( like III. 2-12, VI. 1-13, 
XI. 20-42 ) which contain many verses interposed between prose 
passages. In this respect Vasishfha's work is on a -par with Bau- 



9. Vaaitfho-dhannadttra 5$ 

dhayana's, in the fourth praSna of which there are chapters entirely 
consisting of verses. It has therefore been argued that the text-of 
Vasistha was tampered with freely, particularly as regards the chap- 
ters at the end. But as shown below it will have to be admitted 
that the interpolations, whatever they may be, were made at a very 
early period* The Mitaksara quotes Vas. by name about 80 times 
and the quotations are taken from almost every chapter from the 
first to the last. For example, Mit. quotes Vas. 27. 1 on Yaj. III. 
311, Vas. 27. 21 on Yaj. III. 324, Vas. 28.7 on Yaj. III. 298, 
Vas. 28. 18, 19 and 22 on Yaj. III. 310. Even Medhatithi quotes 
Vasistha over twenty times. The quotations are mostly taken from 
the first chapter to the 21 st. Only one quotation from the last 
few chapters ( viz. 27. 16 ) has been found in Medhatithi ( on 
Manu XI. 211) and that too is not quoted as Vasisfha's, but is 
ascribed to 'others/ Visvarupa, who flourished about the first quarter 
of the 9th century quotes Vas. about thirty times in his commentary 
on the ficara and vyavahdra sections of Yaj. These quotations hardly 
differ in any respect from the text of Dr. Ftihrer's edition and are 
scattered over almost all chapters from the 1st to the 17th, six 
quotations being taken from chapters 3 and 17 each. In the 
prayaScitta section Visvarupa quotes Vas. even more frequently. 
Besides several sutras from the 1st, 4th, 10th and nth chapters, he 
quotes here no less than 22 sutras of the 20th chap, and 9 of the 
2 1 st. Moreover sutras 37 and 39 of the 23rd chap, are quoted 
( on Yaj. Ill 281-282 ). What is more remarkable is that two verses 
( 2-3 ) of the 28th chapter are ascribed to Vasistha and explained in 
detail ( on Yaj. III. 256 ), while Vas. 28. 4 is quoted without the 
author's name. These facts make it certain that the Vas. Dh. S. 
contained in Visvarupa's day all the chapters from the first to the 
23rd and also the 28th. Saiikara in his bhasya in Br. Upanisad 
( III. j. 1 ) quotes Vas. X. 4 and on Br. Up. IV. 5. 15 he quotes 
Vas. VII. 3. The Vas. Dh. S. quotes numerous verses preceded 
by the words € athapyudaharanti ', which is the case with 
Baudhayana also. Several verses occur without these words being 
prefixed, but most of them seem to be quotations ( e. g. Vas. II. 3 
which combines Manu. II-169 and 170, IV. 6 which is Manu 5. 41, 
VI. 6 and 8 which are Manu IV. 157 and 158). Some of these 
verses introduced with the words ' athapi * &c. as well as some of 
those not so introduced are in the regular classical Upajati, Upen- 
dravajra or Indravjra (vide, I. 38, X. 20 for verses with athapi &?, 



JftmO^f fjf MJmEnmKmMmnk 

and VI. 9 and 25, X. 17, XVI. 36 for verses without them ). Sbme 
of the verses are in the ancient Trisfubh form ( e. g. VI. 3 and 30, 
Vm. 17, XVII. 71 ). In one verse (VI. 5 ) there are twelve letters 
in the first pada and 1 1 in the rest. One quotation with the words 
u athapi " 8cc. is in prose ( II. 5 ). There are a few un-Paninean 
forms like 'Vivadanti'inXIV.47 (videPaninil. 3.47 ). It looks as if 
the dharmasutra once ended with the 24th chapter, where we have 
an injunction ( in sutra 6 ) against imparting the dharmasfitra to 
one who is not a son or pupil. The same sutra occurs in Baudha- 
yana Dh. S. IV. 4. 9 and the succeeding sfltra is the same in both. 
But the words ' prayascitta has been described in the rahasyd sections 
for playing false to the husband ' ( in Vas. V. 4 ) apparently refer 
either to chapters 25-28 (which contain rahasya penances) or to 
some prototype of those chapters now lost. 

The Vas. Dh. S. quotes largely ftom the Rgveda and other Vedic 
Sathhitas. Among the Brahmanas, the Aitareya and Satapatha are 
frequently cited. The Vajasaneyaka (Vas. 12. 31 and 23. 13 ) and 
the Kafhaka (Vas. 12. 24 and 30. 5 ) are mentioned by name. The 
Tai. Aranyaka is quoted in Vas. 23. 23. The Upanisads and 
Vedanta occur in 22. 9. Vasisfha quotes a gatha of the Bhallavins 
from their Nidana work about the extent of the home of Brahmanism, 
which is quoted by Baudhayana also ( Dh. S. I. 1 . 27). He speaks 
of the aftgas of the Veda ( 3. 23 and 13.7) and gives their number 
as six (3. 19). Itihasa and Purana are mentioned in 27. 6. The 
science of words ( grammar ), of omens and portents and of astrology 
and astronomy ( Naksatravidya ) are referred to in 10. 20-21. He 
prohibits the learning of the language of the Mlecchas ( in 6. 41 ). 
Vas. quotes a verse that states that the view holding the aprdntfliiya 
of the Vedas leads to perdition ( 12. 41 ). In Vas. II. 8-n occurs 
the Vidyasukta in four verses that we meet with in the Nirukta ( II- 
4 ). Vasisfha calls his own work dharmaSastra ( in 24. 6 ) and 
probably refers to other works on dharina in the words f one who 
studies dharmas' (in 3. 19 ). The study of dharma&stra as a 
penance for even mortal sins is spoken of in 27. 19. Vas. quotes 
several authors on dharma&stra. He quotes a verse from Harita 
( in JL 6 ) which occurs in Baudhayana also with slight variations 
(Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 7 ), though without the author's name. The 
two halves of this verse are almost the same as the latter halves of 
Mittu. 2. 171-172. Btihler is therefore not quite accurate when he 



says without qualification that the verse attributed to H&rita occurs 
in Manu ( p. XX, S. B. E. vol. XIV ). Vas. quotes Gautama twice 
(in 4. 35 and 37 ) about impurity on death, the first corresponding 
to Gautama ( 14. 41 ), while there is nothing in Gautama to 
correspond to the 2nd. Vas. quotes a verse (11. 20) which mentions 
Yamabyname and embodies the fetter's views. Vas. (18. 13-15) 
quotes three Slokas sung by Yama, one of which ( 14 ) is the same 
as Manu 4. 80 and another ( 15 ) is very similar to Manu 4. 81. 
Another 51oka of Yama is quoted by Vas. ( 19. 48 ) which is almost 
the same as Manu 5. 93. From these facts and others Bflhler draws 
the conclusion (S. B. E. vol. XIV, p. XX) that these verses were 
taken from the M&navadharmasutra, which occupied the same 
position in Vasistha's day as the Manusmrti does at present. I demur 
to this conclusion, which will be discussed later on in detail ( under 
Manusmrti )• Vas. ( 14. 30-32 ) quotes slokas of Prajapati, the 
first of which mentions Yama by name. Vas. 14. 16-19 an( l 2 4" 2 7 
are quoted as slokas of Prajapati, three of which (14. 16, 18 and 24) 
are practically the same as Manu. 4. 248, 249 and 5. 127. Vas. 14. 
19 contains zpada which occurs in Manu 4. 212. It is remarkable 
that the Vas. Dh. S. cites Vasistha himself with great reverence (as 
bhagavdn) in 2. 50 ( about the rate of interest), 24. 5 (about 
Krcchra penance), 30.11. In numerous places the Vas. Dh. S. 
either refers to Manu by name or quotes the views of Manu (under the 
form c iti Manavam') or a sloka of Manu (with the words 'Manavam 
slokam ). All these passages have an important bearing on the age 
of the Manusmrti and on the supposed existence of a Manavadharma- 
sOtra. They therefore deserve to be carefully examined. Vas. 1. 17 
is in prose (about local, family or caste usages ) and summarises the 
views of Manu. The absence of the word *iti* before 'abravln* 
Manufr' and the form of the sutra itself clearly establishes that Vas. 
is not directly quoting a sutra of Manu. That sfttra is only a 
summary of our Manu I. 118. Vas. 3. 2 (which is preceded by the 
words 'M&navam slokam') is Manu II. 168. And so are Vas.* 13. 16, 
20. 18, which are Manu 4. 117 and 11.151 (with very slight variations). 
That the latter existed in Vasiftha's text is vouched for by Aparftrka 
(p. 1075). Vas. 4. 5 is in prose and cites the view of Manu that 
animals may be sacrifice4 only for worshipping atid honouring the 



SB IRstori/ qf DhoTrnatfytru 

manes, deities and guests ,0 $. There is hardly anything to show 
that it is a direct quotation from Manu and not a summary of Manu's 
views. The sutra briefly summarises the views that we find 
expressed in our Manu 5. 22, 32, 41 and 42 (the words of 42 
*e§varthesu pasum hirhsan' are interesting and bear a close resem- 
blance to 'pasum himsyad' in Vas.). That sutra is followed by a 
verse which is the same as Manu 5. 41. It is to be noted that the 
same verse occurs in the dharmasutra of Vi§ou ( 51. 64 ) which reads 
c nanyatreti kathamcana * for * nanyathetyabravin Manub \ This 
change appears to have been purposely made to keep up the 
impression that the Vispu-Dh. S. emanated from Vi§^u himself and 
so could not have borrowed from a human author. Vas. 4. 7 is 
very similar to Manu 5. 48. Btihler ( S. B. E. Vol. 25, p. xxxi ) is 
wrong in taking Vas. 4. 8 as a quotation from the Manavadharma- 
sfitra. There is nothing to show that it is so taken. It is more 
probably a quotation from or a summary of a Brahmana passage 
( compare a quotation in Apararka on Yaj. 1. 109, which is similar ). 
Vide note 46. Vas. 23.43 (where Manu is referred to as prescribing an 
easy penance called Sisukrcchra for children and old men) corresponds 
more or less with Manu 11. 211 and 219 and Vas. 26. 8 has evidently 
Manu 11. 260 in view. There are only two places in Vasisjha where 
the name of Manu occurs for which it is not possible to point out a 
corresponding verse in the Manusmrti. They are Vas. 12. 16 and 19 
37. The latter is cited as a Manavasloka and is in the Upajati metre. 106 
Because this is not found in our Manu, Buhler and other Western 
scholars seem to think that the verse is taken from the Manava- 
dharmasutra which once existed in mixed prose and verse and is now 
lost. But as will be shown elsewhere this hypothesis is based, to say 
the least, on very slender foundations. Besides these two that are 
not found in our Manu, there are about forty verses that are 
common to the Vas. Dh. S. and the Manusmrti and about a dozen 
verses which, though not strictly identical, are more or less similar* 
There are several prose sutras of Vas. which correspond to the

verses of Manu almost word for word. 10 ? The hypothesis that 
commends itself to me is that Vas. contains borrowings from the 
Manusmrti or its purer ancient original in verse. 

In the words c £ramanakenagnimadhaya , ( Vas. 9. 10 ), the sutra 
of Vikhanas seems to be referred to. Gautama (Dh. S. 3. 26) 
contains the same words. Vasistha's 22nd chap, is the same as 
Gautama's 19th and Baudhayana's tenth in the ^ripraina and seems 
to have been borrowed from Gautama. Vasistfia refers to the 
views of others in the words 'eke' or 'anye' ( Vas. 1. 12, 13, 25; 4. 
10; 17, 66; 20. 2 ). Dr. Jolly ( S. B. E. vol. VII, p. xvm) thinks that 
Vas. 28. 10-15 and 18-22 are borrowed from the Visnudharma- 
sfctra chap. LVI and LXXXVII [or its original the Kathakadharma- 
sfctra. Dr. Jolly is not right with regard to both the places. 
Blihler has already pointed out his mistake as to the second passage 
(S. B. E. vol. XIV p. XXII ). The verses in Vas. 28. 10-15 occur 
in several smrtis (vide Saftkhasmrti, 10th chap, in Jivananda's 
ed. part II. pp. 356-357 for the same verses). Besides Vas. 28.11 
occurs in Baud. Dh. S. IV. 3. 7. Hence it is hardly proper for any 
scholar to make the dogmatic assertion that one particular smrti 
must have borrowed from any other. The rather very corrupt 
passage in Vasisfha ( 16. 21-23 108 ) very closely resembles a 
passage of Saftkha, which is cited by Visvarupa on Yaj.I. 305 and by 
the Kjtya-kalpataru ( I. O. Cat. Ms. No. 852, folio 8a ). 

Btthler is of opinion that the home of the school to whfcti the 
Vas. Dh. S. belonged lay to the north of the Narmada and the

Vindhya ( S. B. E. vol. XIV p. XVI ). When it is extremely pro- 
blematical whether the Vas. Dh. S. was the product of a school, h 
is idle to speculate as to the home of the Vas. Dh. S. Btthler's is no 
more than a mere conjecture and it is better to a^pait that we know 
nothing positive at present on th^point. 

The earliest work to refer to Vasistha as an authority on dharma 
is our Manu ( 8. 140 ), saying that Vas. allowed i/8oth of the prin- 
cipal as interest per month. This appears to refer to the rule in Vas. 
2. 50. We saw above that Vas. borrows from the Manusmrti, 
which in its turn quotes a rule of Vasistha. The explanation of 
this is twofold. Both the Manusmrti and Vas. have received later 
additions and further it is possible that the present Vas. Dh. S. is 
the work of some one who had received the teachings of Vas. 
through a succession of teachers and disciples. Yaj. mentions (1.4) 
Vasistha as a writer on dharma. The Tantravartika as seen above 
( note 55 ) remarks that the Vas. Dh. S. was studied by Rgvedins. 
The same work when speaking of works on dharma puts 
Manu, Gautama and Vasistha in the forefront. Io8 a Visva- 
rupa, Medhatithi and other early commentators largely quote 
from Vas. The verse ' agnerapatyam * (Vas. 28. 16) occurs in 
the Ragim copperplate of Tivaradeva of the last quarter of the 8th 
century (Fleet's Gupta Inscriptions No. 81). Therefore the existence 
of ajMark of Vasistha on dharma at least in the first centuries of the 
Chflffim era is vouched for with certainty and the authenticity of 
its text is supported by eminent writers from the 7th century down- 
wards. Apararka quotes passages from the Bhavisyapuraga which 
have in view the present text of Vas.w Some of the views held by 
Vasistha are very ancient. For example, he speaks of the twelve 
secondary sons, assigns a very inferior position to the Dattaka son 
(17th chapter ), allows tiiyoga ( 17. 56 ff) and the remarriage of 
child widows (17. 74); like Apastamba he mentions only six

forms of marriage ( i . 28-29 ), brahma, daiva, drfa, gdndharva, 
kfdtra and manuja. In some respects his views are different from 
those of early writers like Gautama and Baudhayana. He prohibits the 
marriage of a Brahmana with a Sodra woman (I. 25-26), 
Vide Baud. Dh. S. I. 8. 2 for the contrary view.' He ela- 
borates rules of adoption ( 15th chapter) which are not found in 
Gaut. or Baud, or Apastamba. He speaks of documents as one of 
the three means of proof (Vas. 16. 10-15), while Gautama, Apa- 
stamba and Baudhayana are silent on the point, though in Gautama 
(13. 4) there appears to be a reference to documents. Taking all 
these things into consideration it may be said that Vasi§tha is later 
than Gautama, Apastamba and Baudhayana, but much earlier than 
the beginnings of the Christian era and may tentatively be assigned 
to the period between 300-100 B. C. It has been asserted by an 
eminent authority ( Cambridge History of India vol. I, p. 249 ) 
that Vasi§tha 18. 4 ( vaisyena brahmanyam-utpanno Ramako 
bhavatltyahuh ) probably contains a reference to the Romans. 
This assumptiou is gratuitous and does not deserve serious consider- 
ation. The reading Romaka ( on which the learned writer relies ) 
is not supported by the best mss. and it is most hazardous to seize 
with avidity on a variant reading and to build an imposing structure 
of chronology thereon. The offspring of a Vaisya male from a 
Brahmana woman is designated Ramaka by Vasistha, while Gautama 
calls him Kpa (4. 15 ) and Baud. Dh. S. ( I. 9. 7 ) calls such 
an offspring Vaidehaka ; so Ramaka has as much to do with the 
Romans as with Rameses. In the nibandhas there are several 
quotations ascribed to Vasiftha which are not fpund in the printed 
Dharmasfitra. For example, Haradatta on Gaut. ( 22. 18 ) quotes a 
verse in the Upajati metre which is not found in the present text uo . 

So early a writer as ViSvarttpa cites ( on Yaj. 1. 19 ) the views of 
a writer called Vrddha-Vasisjha. The Mit. on Yaj. ( II. 91) qitotts 
the definition of a jayapatra ( judgment ) from Vrddha-V*$i$tha 
and on III. 20 quotes him about impurity on miscarriage. The 
Smrticandrika quotes about 20 verses from Vrddha-Vasi§tha oa 
dhnika and Sraddha ; Bhatfoji in his gloss on the Caturviih&tiqAit.

( p. 12 ) seems to quote a prose passage fron Vrddha-Va$i$!ML 
From the above it follows that Vrddha-Vasistha was an Garly 
compilation and dealt with almost all such topics ( including 
Vyavahara ) as are dealt with by Yaj. The Mit. also quotes a Bj-had- 
Vasisfha. The Smrticandrika ( III. p. 300 ) quotes a few verses 
from a Jyotir-Vasistha. The I. O. catalogue ( No. 1339 p. 39 2 ) 
speaks of a Vasisjha-smrti in ten adhyayas about the religious 
observances and duties enjoined on devotees of Visnu. 

That Yajnasvamin wrote a commentary on the Vas. Dh. S, 
follows from Govindasvamin's comment on Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 5 1), 
where he quotes Vas. 21. 13 and Yajnasvamin's comment thereon, 

10. Visnudharmasutra. 

The Visnudharmasutra has been printed several times in India > 
viz. by Jivananda in his DharmasastrasaAgraha ( 1876 part I pp. 70- 
x 7 6 )* by the Bengal Asiatic Society ( 1881, ed. by Dr. Jolly with 
extracts from the commentary Vaijayanti), by M. N. Dutt ( Dharma- 
Sastra texts, vol. II. pp. 541-666, Calcutta, 1909) and translated by 
Dr. Jolly ( in the S. B. E. vol. VII with an Introduction). In the 
present work Dr. Jolly's edition has been used. The sutra contains 
one hundred chapters. Though the number of chapters is so large, 
the sutra is not very extensive. There are several chapters such as 
40, 42 and 76 that contain only one sutra and one verse. The first 
chapter and the last two are entirely in verse; the remaining chapters 
are in mixed prose and verse, the versified portion being generally at 
the end of each chapter. As pointed out by the Vaijayanti the sfitra 
is in close relation to one of the oldest schools of the Yajurveda, viz. 
Katha. It also stands in a peculiar relation to the extant Manusmjti. 
According to the Caranavyuha, Katha and Carayaniya are two of the 
twelve sub-divisions of Caraka-sakha of the Yajurveda. Dr. Jolly 
( S. B. E. vol. VII p. XII ) says that the Visnudharmasutra has four 
chapters (21, 67, 73 and 86) in common with the Kajhak-grhya 
( except the final parts in 21, 67, 86 ) and that both drew from a 
common source. Btthler points out ( West and Btihler's digest, 3rd 
ed. p. 35 ) that the Kafhakagrhya found in Kashmir agrees closely 
with the Dharmasutra of Visnu and the mantras in the latter agree 
with the Kathaka recension of the Yajurveda. But the Visnudharma- 
sutra is not the work of the same author that composed the Kathaka 
Srauta or Grhya sutras, nor does it appear thai it formed part of the 



KSthaka Kalpa. Dr. Jolly ( K. u. S. p. 7 ) says that Govindartja 
( 1 2th century ) in his Smrtimanjari cites a passage in prose from a 
Kafhasutrakrt on the penance for Brahmana murder which is wanting 
in our Vi§nusmjrti ( vide S. B. £. Vol. 25, p. xxi n for the passage ). 

The contents of the Vi§nu-dharma-satra are :-r. The earth being 
lifted out of the surging ocean by the great Boar, went to Kafyapa to

The Vi§riudharma-satra somewhat resembles the Dharma-sQtra 
ofVasi$tha. Like the latter it is full of verses. But one feature 
which is peculiar to the Vispu-dharmasatra is that it professes to be 
a fwelation by the supreme Being. None of the other dharflW 



10. ViwsdharmasfUra eft 

sfltras so far described assumes this role. The style of the Vi$gu- 
dharmasatra is easy and somewhat diffuse. It presents hardly any 
ungrammatical forms. The printed text is corrupt only in a few 
cases ; the verses occur generally at the end of chapters. Sometimes 
the number of verses in a chapter is very large e. g, in chapter 20 
there are 21 sutras and $2 verses, in chapter 23 there are 24 verses, 
in chap. 43 there are 14, in chap. 51 there are are 20 verses. Some 
of the verses are in the classical Indravajra (19. 23-24) and the 
Upajati metres (23.61 and 59. 30) and a few are Tri§tubhs ( 29. 
9-10, 30. 47, 72. 77 ). The three Tri§tubhs ( 29. 9-10, 30. 41 ) are 
three out of the four verses of the Vidya-sflkta occurring in the Nirukta 
( II. 4 ). There is one verse (72. 6) which has eleven letters in the 
first p&da and twelve in the remaining three. 

In determining the age of the Visnudharmasutra one is confronted 
with a difficult problem. Some of the chapters undoubtedly contain 
material which is comparatively old and on a level with the ancient 
Dharmasutras of Gautama and Apastamba. Such are the chapters 
about riijadharma and punishments ( 3 and 5 ), the rules about 
twelve sons and the mixed castes ( 15-16 ), funeral rites and mourn- 
ing ( 21 and 22 ). But there are very large portions of the work 
that bear a clear impress of a later date. The Visnudharmasutra and 
the Manusmrti have at least 160 identical verses. But this is not 
all. There are hundreds of sutras which are merely the prose equi- 
valents of verses from the Manusmrti. For example, Vi§nu 2. 3 and 
Manu 2. 16, Visnu 3. 4 and 6 and Manu 7. 69-70, Visnu 3 . 7-10 and 
Manu 7. 115, Visnu 3. n-15 and Manu 7. 116-117, Visnu4. i-i3and 
Manu 8. 132-137, Visnu 5 . 4-7, and Manu 9. 237, Visnu 20. i-2i,and 
Manu I. 67-73, Visnu 51. 7-10 and Manu 4. 209-212, Vi§nu 59. 
21-25 and Manu 3. 70, Visnu 62. 224 and Manu 2. 59, Visnu 71. 
48-52 and Manu 4. 80, and Visnu 96. 14-17 and Manu 6. 46 agree 
almost word for word. The verses that are identical in both are 
found in all the chapters of the Manusmrti from the second to the 
last, the largest number ( about 47 ) occurring in the 5 th and chap- 
ters eleven, two, and three respectively contributing 25, 24, and 
1 9 verses. Therefore the question whether the extant Visnudharma- 
stttra borrows from Manu or vice versa or whether both borrow from a 
common original assumes very great importance. As the corres- 
pondence extends over several hundred verses of the Manusmrti, 
the last hypothesis of borrowing from, a common origin*! does 



AQt recommend itself to me. No such common source is knowp 
to have existed and to say that there were hundreds of floating 
popular verses whose authorship was unknown and which were 
4rawn upon by both works appears to me to be an extremely gratu- 
itous and unsatisfactory assumption. In my opinion it is the extant 
Vi$fludharmasutra that borrowed the verses ad hoc or adapted them 
frpm the Manusmrti. There are several lines of reasoning that 
Strengthen this hypothesis. There are some verses that are iden- 
tical in both, in which the name of Manu occurs, which the Vi?i>u- 
dharmasutra omits by making slight verbal changes. For example, 
Vi$riu 23.50 substitutes € tat parikirtitam ' for f Manur-abravlt ' in 
Manu 5. 131 and Visnu 51.64 reads 'nanyatreti kathamcana* for 
Manu 5.41 € nanyatretyabravin-Manuh ' ( this last occurs in Vas. 
4. 6 ). The reason for these changes is obvious. The Visriu-dharma- 
satra professes to be a direct revelation from Visnu and it is in keep- 
ing with this assumed role that not one human author is mentioned by 
name in the sutra. Therefore where the name of Manu occurred 
in any verse, it was purposely omitted. Another reason why the 
sfltra must be presumed to be the borrower is the character of the 
extant work itself. It is a kind of hotchpotch and contains verses 
that are identical with those of other works. For example, several 
verses of the Bhagavatgita occur in the Vi§ijudharmasutra, Visiju 20, 
48*49 and 51-52 are the same as Gita 2. 13. 23, 24, 28 ; Visnu 72. 7 
and Gita 13. 14-18 are almost identical. Visnu 96. 97 and the first 
half of 98are the same as Gita 13. 1-2, except that in keeping with 
its character of a revelation to the Earth, the Vi§ijudharmasatra 
substitutes ' vasudhe * for € kaunteya ' and c bhavini * for c bharata. • 
Several verses of the Yajnavalkya-smrti are identical with those of 
the Vi$nudharmasQtra. For example, Visjm 6. 41 and Yaj. 2. 53, 
Vi§flu 8. 38 and Yaj. II. 79, Visiju 9. 33 and Yaj. 2. 97, Visi^u 17. 
17 and Y2l"). 2. 138, Vi§nu 17. 23 ( first half) and Yaj. 2. 210 ( latter 
half), Visiju 62. 9 and Yaj. 1. 21, Vi. 63. 51 and Yaj. 1. 117 are iden- 
tical. Besides these there are hundreds of prose sutras that are 
identical with passages of Yajnavaikya. For example, Vi. 3. 72-745= 
Yaj. II. 1-4 ; Vi. 3. 82 5= Yaj. 1. 318-320 ( rules about land grants ) ; 
Vi. 5. 65-69 as Yaj. II. 217-220, Vi. 5. 73 = Yaj. II. 221 ;Vi. 45.3- 
12 sb Yaj. 3. 209-211 ( about diseases suffered by sinners ) ; Vi. 60. 
24 = Yaj. 1. 17 ; Vi. 96. 55-79 = Yaj, 3. 84-90 (about 360 bonesof 
the body ) ; Vi. 96. 80-88 - Yaj. 3. 100-102 ( about the number of 
arteries, veins, muscles etc.);Vi. 96. 89-92*= Yaj. 3* $3-99. Dr. jolly

thinks that Yljfivalkya borrows from Vi§pu the whole of the anato- 
mical section (vide S. B. E. vol. VII, p. XX ). With great respect 
I differ from this opinion. There is nothing to show that the anato- 
mical details were first given to the world by Vi§pu. They must 
have first been embodied in works on medicine such as those of 
Caraka and Suiruta" 1 and were probably copied by Dharmasfltra 
writers. But if there is any borrowing between Vi§nu and Yajfia- 
valkya I think from the character of the Vi§nudharmasutra that it is 
the sfltra that must be regarded as borrowing from Yajnavalkya. 
There are several matters in the extant Vi§nudharmasutra which are 
wanting in Yajnavalkya and which induce one to place the extant 
sfltra later than Yajnavalkya, viz. the name € Jaiva ' for Thursday 
( Vi. 78. 5 ), the long list of tirthas ( Vi. chap. 85 ) which include 
Sriparvata and the five rivers of the south called southern Paficanada, 
the importance of the conjunction of the moon and Jupiter on a 
full moon day ( Vi. 49. 9-10 ), the vague definition of Aryavarta 11 * 
( Vi. 84. 4). The verse in Vi§pu 54. 33 ( about half prayascitta 
for boys and old men ) is ascribed to Angiras by the Mitak§ara (on 
Yaj. III. 243 ). 

Therefore the most probable conclusion is that the extant Vi$ou- 
dharmasfitra borrows from the Manusmrti, Yajnavalkya and other 
authors. It would be too much to assume that the Manusmrti, the 
Bhagavatglta and Yajnavalkya borrow from such a comparatively 
unimportant work as the Vispudharmasutra. 

The above conclusion is further strengthened by certain other con- 
siderations. The Manusmrti has been quoted with utmost reverence 
by a host of writers from the fifth century downwards, such as Sahara, 
Kumarila and £afikaracarya. Yajnavalkya was commented upon by 
ViSvarQpa in the first half of the 9th century. ViSvarQpa in his commen- 
tary quotes scores of sutras from Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhayana, 
Vasi$tha,$aftkha and Harita. But it is significant that Visvarupa in his 
commentary on Yajnavalkya does not quote even a single sutra of 
Vijiju by name. It is true that ViSvarupa (on Yaj. III. 66) says that

the four forms of asceticism (p&rhrajya ) should be understood from 
other smrtis like those of Vi§nu ,IJ . This probably refers to chap. 
97 of the extant Vi§ijudharmasutra. Medhatithi ( on Manu 3. 248 ) 
quotes Visnu (21. 12 ) and on Manu 9. 76 quotes a sfltra of Vi§$u 
which I could not trace in the printed Vijflu. 11 * The Mitak§ara 
mentions Visnu about thirty times. The quotations are taken from 
chapters 19, 21, 22, 35-42, 50, si, 52, 75 and 79 of the Vi§iju- 
dharmasutra, 18 sQtras of chap. 22 ( on a&raca and kindred topics ) 
being quoted on Yaj. III. 23, 24, 27, 29-30. But it is a remarkable 
fact that not one of the verses in the extant VisrmdharmasGtra is cited 
as Visnus in the Mitaksara. The only exception is a verse cited as 
Visrm's on Yaj. III. 265, which has the same purport as Vi§pu 52. 
14 ( a verse ) and the first pada of which is identical with that 
of the verse in the Visriudharmasutra. 11 * A few verses that are 
quoted as Visnu's in the Mitak$ara could not be traced 
in the extant dharmasatra.' 16 It is not unlikely that the 
sQtra first contained mostly prose sQtras based on Manu 
and the Kathakagrhya and verses were tacked on later. 
Among later writers of nibandhas Apararka quotes Visnu most 
profusely and the Smjticandrika also quotes Vi§pu about 225 times.

10. Vtywdhamarittra 67 

Many of the verses found in Vi. are quoted by Apararka as Visnu's, e. g. 
Vi, 84. 4 on Yaj. z. 2 ; 68. 46-47 on Yaj. z, 106 ; 67. 33 on Yaj. 1. 
107; 5. 183 on Yaj. 2. 60; 10. 9-ZI on Yaj. 2. 101. But there are 
numerous verses quoted as Visiiu's by Apararka which are not found 
in the stttra, e. g. on Yaj. I. 21, 53, 89, 100. Apararka quotes almost 
whole chapters of Vi$pu, e. g. Vi. 68 on Yaj.* 1. 106 and 90 on 
Yaj. I. 208, 70 on Yaj. 1. 114. It is to be noted that Vi. 70. 17 
( a verse ) is quoted by Apararka as a prose sutra (on 1. 114 ) with 
slight verbal changes. All these facts make one feel naturally scep- 
tical about the authenticity of most of the verses in the extant Visnu- 
dharmasQtra. They probably formed no part of the sutra at the 
time when the Mitaksara was composed. At all events it cannot be 
gainsaid that the verses are a very late pan of the satra. 

The Visrmdhamasfitra contains quotations from all the Vedic 
samhitas and from the Aitareya-brahmana ( as in Vi. 15. 45 ). It 
mentions the Vedafigas very frequently (30. 3 and 38, 28. 35, 83. 6), 
it speaks of Vyakarana ( 83. 7 ), of itihasa ( 3. 70, 30. 38, 83. 7 ), 
of Dharma&stras ( 3. 70, 30. 38, 73. 16, 83. 8), of Puraria 
( 3. 70, 30. 38 &c. ). About the close correspondence between 
Baud. III. 6 and Visnu. 48 and between Vas. 28. 10-zs and 
18-22 and Visnu 56 and 87 vide remarks made above 
pp. 23, 57. The sGtra quotes several verses (called gathas) and says 
they were sung by pitrs ; vide 78. 52-53, 80. 14, 83. 21, 85. 65-67. 
They bear close resemblance to the gathas sung by the pitrs quoted 
in the Anusasana-parva 88. 11-15 and a half verse 'esjavya bahavafc 
putra yadyekopi Gayam vrajet* is the same in Vi. 85. 67 and Anu. 88. 
14. The Visnusmrti enumerates twenty one hells (43. 1-22), 
which are almost the same as Yajfiavalkya's (3. 222-224). It 
mentions the names of the seven days of the week (78. 1-7), Thurs- 
day being called Jaiva, while Yajiiavalkya mentions only the seven 
planets ( with Rahu and Ketu ) in the same order ( I. 296 ). It 
recommends the practice oi sail (25. 14), speaks of pustakas Q18. 44, 
23. 56), a word which is not used by the other dharmasutras so 
far described. It gives a long list of good and evil omens at the 
time of starting on a journey ( 63. 33-39 ). Among evil omens it 
includes the sight of yellow-robed ascetics ( i. e. Buddhists probably) 
and Kapalikas ( 63. 36 ). It prohibits speech with Mlecchas, 
Antyajas ( 7Z. 59 ) and journeys to Mleccha countries ( 84. 2 ). It 
contain? special directions about the worship of Vasudeva in chap. 49

and speaks of Svetadvlpa as the reward of devotion to Vasudeva ( 49. 
4). Here and there, there are eulogies of Vasudeva ( u 50-57, 65. 1, 
97. 10, 98 which gives one hundred names of Vi§i>u ). It speaks of 
the four vyuhas of Vasudeva (67. 2 ) and of the Varaha incarnation. 
It gives a vague location of Aryavarta as a country where the four 
varpas exist ( 84. 4 ). It enumerates numerous sacred places ( 85. 
1-52), among which Sriparvata, Saptirsa (modern Satara?), 
Godavari and southern Pancanada deserve to be specially noted. 
Though it does not specifically enumerate the eighteen titles of law 
just as Yajnavalkya does not, yet it contains rules (in chapters $-6) 
on almost all of them. 

As Yajnavalkya enumerates Visnu among the propounders of 
dharmasastras, it follows that a work of Vi§ou existed in comparati- 
vely early times. What matters that work embraced it is difficult to 
say. It probably contained the topics found in the works of Gautama, 
Apastamba and others. It may have included portions borrowed 
from the Kathakagrhya. When Dr. Jolly says that certain chapters 
of Visrm agree closely with the Kathakagrhya, all that is meant is 
that some of the sutras of Visnu are the same or almost the same as 
those of the Kathakagrhya ( e. g. compare Vispu 21, 73 and 86 with 
Kathakagrhya V. 12, V. 9, and V. 3 respectively ). But in all these 
places V^?nu contains more details than the Kathakagrhya. It may 
however be noted that in a few cases the views of the Kathakagrhya 
differ from those of Visnu. For example, Vispu ( 30. 1 ) speaks of 
Vedic studies for 4^ months only in the year when once they are 
started on the full-moon day of Sravana or Bhadrapada, while the 
Kathakagrhya ( I. 9. 10 ) gives three alternatives, viz. 4^, 5 or 
5 J^ months ; Vi§iju prescribes that the proper year for the upanayana 
of a k§atriya is the nth from conception (27. 16), while the Kathaka 
prescribes the 9th, without specifying whether it is from conception 
or birth (IV. 1. 2) ; Visnu enumerates eight forms of marriage ( 24. 
18), while the Kathaka ( II. 3 and 4 ) speaks of only two, Brahma 
and Asura, and is silent about the rest ; Vi§iju (46.19-20) defines 
Santapana and Mahasantapana differently from the Kathaka ( I. 7. 
3-4 ), but agrees with Yajnavalkya ( III, 315-316 ). Here the recent 
Lahore edition of the Kathakagrhya by Dr. Caland has been used. 
As it used Kathaka mantras and borrowed from the Kathakagrhya, 
the dharmasatra may have been a text-book of the Kathaka school 
and probably originated in Kashmir and Punjab which is the Jioip? 



of the Kaphas. The date of the older portion of Visnu may be 
placed between 300 B.C. to 100 B.C. But this is no more than a mere 
conjecture. It is to be noted that Kumarila does not mention the 
yijijudharmasutra among the sQtras studied by particular schools. 
Then several centuries later on the whole of the sutra was recast 
from the Vaisnavite point of view and received large additions both 
in prose and verse. When these additions were made we have no 
exact means of determining. It is probable that they were not 
made very long before ViSvarupa. At all events the additions were 
made long after the Yajnavalkyasmfti and after the 3rd 
century. The mention of the week days makes the sutra compara- 
tively a late work. The earliest epigraphic mention of a week day is 
in the Eran inscription of 484 A. D. (vide Fleet's Gupta inscriptions 
pp. 88-89 ) and Varahamihira ( 6th century ) knew the week days 
well. The Brahmapurana (28. 55) mentions Sunday and the 
Padmapurana mentions Thursday ( Brahmakharida chap. n. 34). 
The Surya-siddhanta (XII. 6 and 78) speaks of the lords of days. 
Thus although the extant Visnu-dharmasutra is a late recast, it 
contains a few doctrines that were held in ancient times. For 
example it allows a Brahmana to marry a girl of anyone of the four 
castes (24. 1 ) and does not inveigh against niyoga as Manu does. 

A few of the sutras agree closely with Narada. Vide Vi. 7. 10- 
11 and Narada (Rnadana verses 136-137). 

The Mitaksara quotes all the prose passages of chapters 35-42 
and ascribes them to Brhadvisnu ( on Yaj. 3. 242). Similarly on 
Yaj. 3. 261 it ascribes Vi. 35. 3-5 to Brhadvisiju. Similarly the 
Smrticandrika(II. p. 298) ascribes Vi. 17. 4 ff to Brhad-Visflu, 
The Mitaksara (on Yaj. 3. 267) quotes a verse of Vrddha-Visnu 
which summarises some sutras of Visnu "7 (50. 6 and 12-14). 

In the Anandasrama collection of smrtis there is a Laghu-Vis^u- 
smrti in five chapters and 114 verses dealing with the duties of the 
vartjas and the four dramas. Apararka in his commentary on Yaj. 
3. 258 quotes four verses from Laghu-Vispu, which are not found 
in the Anandasrama text. So Apararka used some other work or 
perhaps a larger work. The Parasara-Madhaviya often quotes gadya- 

117 The verso of 33^03 U jift g ^3 ^T<TT^T *|fa* *5?PJ I *<M$V- 



Vi$au and padya-Visnu. The former from a quotation in vol. I. 
part 2, p. 234 seems to be the Visrm-dharmasutra itself. In the 
Sarasvativilasa numerous sutras of Vi§nu with the explanations of 
Bharuci thereon are quoted, which are not found in the printed 
Visou." 8 4 

The Visriu-dharmasutra was commented upon by Nandapaiidita, 
author of several works on dharmasastra, who wrote at Benares the 
commentary called Vaijayanti ( according to certain mss. ) in 1679 
(i.e. 1622-23 A. D.) of the Vikrama era. Dr. Jolly publishes 
extracts from this commentary in his edition of the sutra. 

From the fact that the Sarasvativilasa quotes several times the 
sutras of Visnu with Bharuci's explanation, it looks probable that 
Bharuci commented upon the Visnudharmasutra. For further infor- 
mation on Bharuci vide sec. 61. 

So far only the printed and well-known dharmasutras have been 
passed under review. But there were nnmerous other dharma- 
sutras which are either now extant in rare mss. or are not yet 
discovered but are only to be reconstructed from quotations. It is 
now time to discuss them. 

1 1 . The Dharmasutra of Harita 

That Harita was an ancient sutrakara on dharma is quite patent 
from the fact that the dharmasutras of Baudhayana, Apastamba and 
Vasistha quote him as an authority (vide pp. 25, 39, 54). Apastamba 
quotes Harita more frequently than any other author. From this it may

be concluded that they belonged to the same Veda. TheTantravartika 
(vide note 55 above) mentions Harita along with Gautama and 
other sQtrakaras on dharma. From Visvarupa down to the latest 
writers on dharmasastra Harita is most profusely quoted. From the 
quotations it appears that his dharmasutra was perhaps the most 
extensive of all dharmasutras. 

The late Pandit Vamansastri Islampurkar discovered at Nasik a 
nis. of the Harita-dharmasutra. It was not possible for me to make 
use of it for the present work. Dr. Jolly (in R. und S. pp. 8-9) 
gives an account of the ms. from which I give a summary. It is so 
faulty that an edition based on it alone cannot be thought of. The 
ms. contains thirty chapters. So far as the language and contents 
are concerned the work impresses one as ancient, but the material 
citations ascribed to Harita in later digests on court procedure and 
the law of crimes &c. are not found in the ms. The prose is mixed 
up with verses in Anustubh and Trisjubh metres, which are often 
introduced with the characteristic words " athapyudaharanti " as in 
other dharmasutras. The ms. quotes ' bhagavan Maitrayani ' and 
tbe verse " Satadayo viro " which is Maitrayaniya Samhita I. 7. $. 
Dr. Caland points out remarkable correspondence between the cita- 
tions of Harita and the Maitrayaniya Parisista and Manavasraddha- 
kalpa. All this tends to show that he was a sutrakara of the Black 
Yajurveda. The numerous quotations from Harita in Apastamba 
and Baudhayana are not however found in the ms. The ms. was 
found at Nasik, which is also the source of two mss. of the Maitra- 
yaniya Samhita. The Kashmirian word 'kaphella' is cited in Harita 
and so the Harita-dharmasutra probably originated there. Hemadri 
(caturvarga III. i.p. 559) mentions a commentator ( bhasyakara 11 *) 
of Harita. 

From the numerous quotations from Harita in the nibandhas it 
appears that the dharmasutra dealt exhaustively with the same topics 
as are dealt with in other dharmasutras, viz. sources of dharma, 
brahmacarin of two kinds ( upakurvana and naisphika ), sufitaka, the 
householder, the forest hermit, prohibitions about food, impurity 



119 The sUtra of Harita is « <fl?5|j^-5m^-^^^

on birth and death, sraddha, the panktipavana, general rules of con- 
duct, the five yajnas, Vedic study and holidays, duties of kings, 
rules of statecraft, court procedure, the various titles of law, duties 
of husband'-and wife, various kinds of sins, prayakittas, expiatory 
prayers &c. 

According to Kullflka ( on Manu 2. i ) the Harita-dharmasutra 
opened with the words € now then we shall explain dharma ; dharma 
is based upon revealed texts (sruti ) ; revealed texts are of two kinds, 
the Vedic and the Tantric. 120 ' The quotations show that this very 
style was pursued in the body of the work. Apararka ( on Yaj. III. 
322 ) quotes a sutra" 1 in similar style about a penance 'tulapurusa* 
said to have been promulgated by Siva himself. The sutra often 
introduces verses as quotations with the words " an author says 
thus" (evam hyaha;twfe Apararka on Yaj. I. 83,1.154, III. 135, 
Vivada-ratnakara pp. 443, 626 ). Numerous passages quoted as 
Harita's are identical with passages from other dharmasastra works. 
The sutra c Jayapatyorna vibhago vidyate ' is quoted as from Harita 
by the Smrticandrika (II. p. 268), which is the same as Ap. Dh. S. IL 
6. 14, 16. The same work quotes 'pratyaksavidhanad garhasthyasya ' 
as from Harita which is part of Gautama 3. 35. A verse about the 
enormity of usury quoted in the Smrticandrika ( I. p. 177 ) as 
Harita's is almost the same as Baudhayana ( I. 5. 79) and Vasistha 1 *- 
( 2. 42 ). A verse about atipatakins ( quoted by Apararka on Yaj. 
III. 231 ) is the same as Visnu 34. 2. Manu is mentioned by name 
in several verses ( vide Smrticandrika III. p. 426, Vivada-ratnakara 
p. 552-553). Two verses are cited in the Vyavaharatattva ot Raghu- 
nandana as found in Harita, Baudhayana (I. 10. 30) and Manu 
( 8. 18-19 )• A verse quoted by the Smrticandrika (II. p. 21 ) is 
almost the same as Manu 8. 95. Several times we have the words 
1 Prajapativaco yatha*(vide Apararka on Yaj. I. 154 and Smrti- 
candrika I. p. 181 ). Harita seems to have relied upon the views

( eke, apare"* ) and sometimes refutes them."* 

Harita refers to the Vedas, the Aftgas, dharma&stra, metaphy- 
sics, and other branches of knowledge." 6 The quotations do not 
show that he belonged to any particular Veda, as he quotes from 
all the Vedas promiscuously. In this connection it is worthy of 
note that though Kumarila mentions Harita as an ancient dharma- 
sutrakara, he does not assign him to any particular school, while he 
assigns Apastamba and Baudhayina to the Taittiriya school. 

Some of the doctrines of Harita are worth noting. He speaks 
of eight forms of marriage, but two of them are styled Ksatra and 
Manusa, while Ar§a and Prajapatya are omitted ( vide Viramitrodaya, 
Samskaraprakasa, p. 84 ). Vasisfha has the same nomenclature 
( I. 29 ). Harita speaks of two sorts of women ( brahmavadinis

and forbids the employment of a Brsthmaija actor in any sraddha or

a lengthy passage in mixed prose and verse, where the worship 
of Gagesa comes in."'

A very interesting question is the relation of the verse quotations 
from Harita with the prose quotations from Harita. The dharma- 
sfltra was probably interspersed with verses as is the case more or 
less with all dharmasfitras except that of Gautama. But there are 
numerous verses ascribed to Harita in the nibandhas, which are 
manifestly modern. Both the Mitaksara and Apararka ( on Yaj. I. 
86 ) quote Harlta's verses eulogising the sati. The Smrticandrika 
( III. p. 344 ) quotes his verses that refer to the signs of the Zodiac. 
There are numerous verses containing elaborate rules of procedure, 
ascribed to Harita, which are quite foreign to the general atmos- 
phere of the ancient dharmasutras. All such verses must be ascribed 
to a comparatively later date. In the Suddhimayukha it is said 
that certain verses quoted from the Mahabharata by Harita are not 
found in several copies of the Mahabharata. 

Dr. Jolly (in 1889) collected together most of the prose and 
verse citations from Harita on the Vyavahara section. In Jivananda's 
collection, we have a Laghu-Harita smrti ( I. pp. 177-193) and a 
Vfddha-Haritasmrti (I. pp. 194-409). The former contains seven 
adhyayas and about 250 verses, dealing with the duties of the four 
castes and the airamas and with Yoga. The latter is professedly a 
Vai§pavite work, said to have been proclaimed by Harita to Ambarisa; 
it is divided into eight chapters and contains about 2600 verses, 
dealing with the nitya and naimittika rites of the varqas and asramas, 
the nature of the individual and supreme self and the means of 
attaining moksa. In the Anandasrama collection of smrtis, Virddha- 
Harita is divided into eleven chapters, the first two of Jivananda's 
being split up into five. The AnandaSrama collection contains a 
Laghu-Harita-smrti in 117 verses which is different from the Laghu- 
Harita of Jivananda. The former deals with purification from 
pollutions of various kinds, with prayascittas, rules about impurity 
on birth and death, Sraddha and a few rules about inheritance, 
partition &c. 

It is noteworthy that Apararka ( onjYaj. III. 254 ) quotes Vrddha- 
Hirifa and Harita, both in prose, one immediately after another. 

That the Vfddha-Hatfta in verse is comparatively a late work 
follows from the fact that it distinctly recites that the smrtisof Manu> 
Yijnavalkya, Narad* and Kityayana were known to it as authorities

on r&ja-dharma. 1 ' Same of the quotations ascribed to Laghu-Harlta 
in Apar&rka and other works are found in the Laghu-Harita, e. g. 
the verse c vinayajnopav!tena > (Laghu«Harita 9 Anand^rama, verse 25) 
is quoted by AparSrfca on Yaj. III. 289. Some verses that are as* 
cribed to Harita are found in the Laghu-Harita, for example, the verse 
' snanam kjtva tu ye ', cited by the Smrticandrika (I. p. 203), occurs 
in the Laghu-Harita ( AnandaSrama, verse 41 ). It appears that 
several compilations were made at different times, embracing different 
topics of dbarnux and ascribed to Harita, probably because they were 
based more or less on the HaritadharmasQtra. 

That some of the verses ascribed to Harita are very ancient 
follows from several considerations. For example, Visvarflpa quotes 
( on Yaj. III. 246 ) a verse from Harita. The Sarasvativilasa quotes 
from Harita a brief passage which appears to be a portion of a verse 
and Katyayana's explanation thereon. 1 ' 1 It follows that long before 
the sixth century A. D. Harita existed in verse.

12. The Dharmasutra of Sankha- Likhita 

From the Tantravartika we learn (note 5 s above) that the 
Dharmasutra of SaAkha-Likhita was specially studied by the Vaja* 
saneyins ( the followers of the white Yajurveda). The Tantravartika 
also quotes a few words from that dharmasutra which constitute an 
Anustubh pada. 1 * 2 The Mahabharata ( £anti. chap. 23 ) contains 
the story of the two brothers Saftkha and Likhita. In the Santi- 
parva ( 130. 29 and 132. 15-16 ) the word Saftkha -Likhita seems to 
be used in a double sense, Saftkha also meaning the forehead. Ya« 
jiiavalkya ( 1 . 5 ) mentions Saftkha-Likhita among the writers on 
dharma&tra. The ParaSarasmrti says ( 1. 24 ) that in the four ages 
of Krta, Treta, Dvapara and Kali, the ordinances of Manu, Gautama, 
Saftkha-Likhita and Para&ra are respectively of paramount authority

in matters of dharma. Visvarflpa ( on Yaj. III. 248 ) quotes a verse 
from an ancient author which says that £aAkha and Likhita pondered 
deeply over the dharma promulgated to the sages by Manu and drew 
upon the Veda 1 " also. Commentators and nibandhakdras from 
Visvarflpa downwards profusely quote SaAkha-Likhita. A consi- 
derable portion of these quotations is in prose. Hence it is quite clear 
that the dharmasfltra of &aAkha-Likhita is an ancient one, that it was 
largely if not entirely in prose and that it was once easily accessible 
though it has not yet been discovered. In the Annals of the 
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute ( vol. VII-VIII ) I made 
an attempt at a reconstruction of SaAkha-Likhita. 

Jivananda ( collection of smjrtis, part II., pp. 343-374 ) prints in 
18 chapters and about 330 verses a smfti of SaAkha and a smjrti of 
Likhita in about 93 verses (part II., pp. 375-382). The Ananda&ama 
collection also prints the same text of the two smpis. The latter also 
contains a Laghu-SaAkha-smrti in 71 verses and a &aAkha-Likhita- 
smjti in 32 verses. All these, except perhaps the SaAkha-smrti in 18 
chapters, are late compilations. The smrti in 18 chapters seems to 
have been compiled very early. About fifty verses from it are 
quoted by the Mitaksara. In the nth and 12th chapters occur 
a few prose passages, one of which is quoted even by Medha- 

"tithi. The numerous prose quotations ascribed to §aAkha- 
Likhita do not however occur in these smrtis. One point deserves 
special notice. Comparatively early writers sometimes ascribe the 
same text to SaAkha-Likhita or to SaAkha simply. The well-known 
sfltra about succession to a son-less man ( athaputrasya svaryitasya 
bhratrgami dravyam &c. ) is ascribed to SaAkha by Vi£varflpa and 

'the Mitaksara, but to SaAkha-Likhita by Apararka ( on Yaj. II. 135- 
136). Similarly the sutra 'pitaryasakte kutumbavyavaharan jyesthah' 
&c. is asaribed to SaAkha by Apararka and to saAkha-Likhita by 
the Vivada-ratnakara, Dayatattva and Madanaparijata. Quotations 
ascribed to Likhita are few and far between. Some passages are 
ascribed by some writers to §aftkha and by others to Likhita. For 
example, a prose passage 'Uddhrtya pariksitabhih ' &c. is ascribed to 
Likhita by Apararka ( on Yaj. I. 18 ) and to SaAkha by Visvarflpa 
(.on Yaj. I. 20 ) and by the Viramitrodaya ( Ahnikaprakaia p. 68 ), 
Similarly the sfltra 'ubhabhyamapi hastabhyam praAmukho deva- 
tirthena kuryat* is ascribed to SaAkha-Likhita by the Paraiaramadha*

vfya (I. i. p. 352) and to Likhita by Aparirka (on Yaj, I. 101 ), 
The relation of the §aftkha-smrti in verse to the dharmasfltra of 
SaAkha seems to be this. The former is based upon the latter and is 
a versified paraphrase or adaptation of portions of the dharmasutra.'" 

The versified £afikha shows a tendency towards greater strict- 
ness. The dharmasQtra allows a Bnihmana to marry a woman of 
any of the four castes, while the verse Saftkha restricts him to the 
first three castes. 135 It is not unlikely that the dharmasatra con* 
tained a few verses as is the case with Baudhayana, Apastamba and 
Vasisfha. Even so early a writer as Vtevarupa looked upon the 
prose and verse portions as the composition of the same author 
( vide his comment on Yaj. III. 237, and Aparirka pp. 1149, 1154, 
1161 ). 

The dharmasatra of Saflkha-Likhita was commented upon early. 
Laksmidhara in his Kalpataru ( Ghose's Hindu Law vol. II., p. 504 ) 
draws attention to the fact that the bhasyakara of Saftkha read a well- 
known sutra as 'sa yadyekah syat* instead of 'sa yadyekaputrah syat\ 
Laksmidhara flourished between 11 00-1160 A. D. as he was a 
minister of Govindacandra of Kanauj. The Vivadaratnakara ( 13 14 
A. D. ) also cites the bhasyakara of Sarikha-Likhita. The Vivada- 
cintamani (p. 67 ) quotes from the bhasyakara of SaAkha-Likhita. 

The dharmasatra of Saftkha-Likhita would appear, from the 
quotations in the nibandhas, to have closely resembled the other 
extant sutras on dharma in style and contents. It embraced almost 
all the topics treated of in Gautama or Apastamba. It agrees very 
closely with the words of Gautama and Baudhayana in several 
places. " 6 It is curious to note that a quotation from Satikha

containing the names of writers of smrtis cites £afikha-Likhita as 
•udioiity. 1 " 

The dbannasfitra seems to have permitted niyoga, speaks of 
twelve secondary sons, and did not favour ( like Apastamba ) 
the claims of females to succeed to males. On certain points the 
dharmasutra of Sarikha marks a more advanced state of opinion than 
is the case with Gautama or Apastamba. SaAkha speaks of several 
kinds pf ordeals and appears to have contained elaborate prose rules 
sibout them (vide Apararka on Yaj. II, 95 ; Smrticandrika II., p. 1 12, 
Vlramitrodaya, p. 270 ). As regards partition atid inheritance, 
Saftkha-Likhita gives more detailed information than Apastamba or 
Baudhayana. The limits of Aryavarta t,s stretched over wider areas 
according to &arikha ( i. e. to the east of Sindhu-Sauvira and to the 
west of Kampilya ) than is the case with Baudhayana ( 1. 1. 25 ) 
or Vasisfha ( I. 8-9 ). The style of £aftkha reminde one of Kautilya 
rather than of Gautama. The quotations hardly exhibit any ungram- 
matical forms. It is noteworthy that Yajnavalkya is included among 
the authors of smrtis by Safikha ( vide note 137 above). If it is 
the extant Yajnavalkya-smrti that is meant to be referred to, then 
- the dharmastitra of SaAkha will have to be assigned to a late dat$. 
But this does not seem to be likely. From the fact that the Yajna- 
valkya-smrti itself enumerates Saftkha-Likhita among ancient authors 
on dhartna, from the general style of the work, from the develop- 
ment erf the legal conceptions it presents and from its doctrines about 
the rights of women, it appears almost certain that the extant Yajna- 
valkya-smrti is much later than the dharmasfttra of Saftkha. 
There are close correspondences between Saftkha and Yajnavalkya. 1 "

The prose quotations from Safikba-Likhita refer to the Ved&figas, 
S&Akhya, Yoga, dharma&stra. Saftkha recognised eight forms of 
marriage. The views of Saflkha about the status of the offspring 
of mixed marriages differed from those of Baudhayana ( I. 8. 6 ) 
and Manu (X. 6 ) and were intermediate between the latter two. 140 
The tarpwa 1 * 1 (which resembles the one in Baudhayana, though it 
is more elaborate ) refers to the six Vedaftgas, Bharata ( but not 
Maha-bharata ), to twenty writers on dharma and contains nume- 
rous details about geography, mythology, and cosmogony which are 
generally found in the Puranas. The dharmasOtra frequently cites 
the opinions of others. It mentions by name the views ofPraja- 
pati, Afigirasa and Usanas ( Vivadaratnakara p. 537 ), Pracetasa 
(Vividarat. p. 557-560), Vrddha-Gautama(Madana-parijatapp.70i-2), 
The verse quotations ascribed to Saftkha further mention Yama, 
Katyayana, and Saftkha himself. But in drawing chronological con- 
clusions it is better to leave the verse quotations out of account. 
The same verses are ascribed to Manu and Saftkha 143 and a few stttras 
closely resemble the Manusmrti. 1 " Six identical verses occur in 
the Vasisfha-dharmasutra (28. 10-15) an ^ * n ^ e Saflkha-smrti 
( 10th chap. ). 

All these circumstances lead to the conclusion that the dhaftxia- 
sutra of £afikhar is probably later than Gautama and Apastamba but 
earlier than the Yajnavalkya-smrti and so must be assigned to som6 
date between 300 B. C. to 100 A. D, 

i3. Manavadharmasutra— Did it exist ? 

Following the orthodox view of Western Sanskrit scholars that 
most of the dharmasutras are older than almost all, if not all, the 
metrical smnis, I gave the first place of honour to the dharmasutras of 
Gautama and others. But my own views differ to a great extent 
from those of the orthodox school of Sanskritists represented by Max 
Mailer and Bfihler. It is high time to state here my views about

§9 Riztoty 6f bharintfUird 

the existence of a Manava-dharma-sutra supposed to be the original 
of our extant Manu. 

Some western scholars, particularly Max Miiller and Weber, 
started the ingenious theory that the extant Manusmrti was a recast 
or remodelling of an ancient Manavadharmasutra. Max Mailer went 
so far as to enunciate the bold generalisation "There can be no 
doubt, however, that all the genuine dharma-sastras which we 
possess now, are without any exception nothing but more modern texts 
of earlier sutra works on kuladharmas belonging originally to certain 
Vedic cararias" ( H. A. S. L. pp. 134-135). For this sweeping 
generalisation there were very few data when it was made, as is 
admitted by Bilhler. This theory of Max Mttller was as hasty, as 
unfounded and as uncritical as several other theories of his such as 
that about the renaissance of Sanskrit Literature in the early centu- 
ries of the Christian era, about the absence of the art of writing in 
India before Pacini and about the uniform employment of the sloka 
for literary purposes in his so-called sutra period and earlier. 
Western Scholars had to give up such theories before the stern logic 
of facts, but they have tenaciously clung to the theory about the 
Manusmrti being a recast of the Manavadharmasutra. One of the 
main planks of Max Mailer's edifice was the now exploded theory 
about the non-employment of the anutfubh during the sutra period 
(which he tentatively placed between 600 B. C.-200 B. C.) for con- 
tinuous composition. In spite of the fact that one of the main 
planks has totally collapsed Bilhler makes strenuous efforts to 
rehabilitate Max Mailer's theory by additional d priori arguments 
(S. B. E. vol. 25, pp. xviii-xxiii and xxxi-xxxix). The main 
points brought forward by Bahler are:- (I) The Vasiftha Dh. 
S. ( IV. 5-8 ) contains four sutras, the first of which is The Manava 
says that one may kill an animal only in honouring the Manes, gods 
and guests.* There follow two verses and a passage in prose with 
iff at the end. Btthler argues that all the four sutras are quotations 
and as the extant Manusmrti is in verse, they must be regarded as 
taken from the ManavadharmasQtra. ( II ) There are other quota- 
tions in Vasi§tha attributed to Manu which either contradict the 
preset Manusmrti or have no counterpart in the latter. Buhler 
draws |pecial attention to the fact that Vasi§tha ( 19. 37) quotes a 
Manavm Sloka which is not in the anu§tubh metre and which 
has nf thing corresponding to it in the extant Manusmrti* 



13. MZtuxvadharmawtrar-Eid it exist t Si 

(HI) A fragment of UJanas quotes an opinion of Manu about impurity, 
which is in prose. 144 Bflhler himself points out that here one ms. reads 
'Sumantuh' for 'Manuh\ Therefore this argument is of very little 
use in establishing the existence of a Manavadharmasutra. Besides, 
it is possible that the mutilated passage is not a quotation at all, but 
a mere summary of ManuV views. There is no 'iti' at the end to 
show that it is a quotation. (IV) Kamandakiya-nitisara (II. 3) says that 
according to the Manavas the vidyas to be studied by a king are three, 
viz. the three Vedas, Varta, and Dandaniti and that what is called 
Anviksiki is but a branch of trayi; while the Manusmrti ( 7. 43 ) 
appears to regard the four as distinct vidyas. 1 ** Kamandaka ( XI. 67) 
says that Manu prescribed that the council of ministers should consist 
of twelve ; 14 * while Manu (7. 54 ) says that the 'sacivas' should be 
seven or eight. Biihler therefore argues that Kamandaka has in 
mind the Manavadharmasutra and not the Manusmrti and on the word 
'Manavah' makes the following observations * It is a very common 
practice of Indian authors to refer in this manner to the books restrict- 
ed to special schools. But I know of no case where the doctrines 
of the Minavadharmasastra or of any other work, which is destined 
for all Aryans and acknowledged as authoritative by all, are cited in 
the same or similar way' ( S. B. E. vol. 25, p. XXXVIII). In the 
first place it has to be noted that Kamandaka is only paraphrasing' 
the words of Kaufilya in the above two places. 14 ? Further it is note-

** BUfory cf Dharmaifam 

worthy that Kamandaka employs the word 'Manub* while Kautflya 
uses the word 'Manavah' ( about the number of ministers). There- 
fore according to the Kamandakiyanitisara there was no difference 
between the two, viz. the words 'Manub* and 'Manavafc* denoted the 
same thing, a work. What Bflhler me.ans by his emphasis on the 
word 'Manavah' is not quite clear. Early writers like Kumarila and 
Visvarupa employ the word 'Manavam' with reference to the Manu- 
smrti just as they use the word Vasistfiam to denote the Vasisfha- 
dharmasutra ( vide Tantra-vartika pp. 80, 115, 642 and Visvarttpa 
on Yaj. III. 245 and 257 ). &ankara in his bhasya on Br. Upani§ad 
I.4. 17 applies the word 'manava' to the Manusmrti ' minave 
ca sarva pravrttih kamahetukyeveti ' ( referring to Manu II. 4 ). 
Besides, there is hardly any conflict between the views 
of the Manavas and the Manusmrti on the point 
of the number of the vidyas. The Manavas knew that Anvik§iki 
was counted as a fourth vidya but said that it was really comprehend- 
ed in the study of the Vedas. The Manusmrti only lays down 
from whom the vidyas were to be learnt. As regards the number 
of ministers, wc cannot afford to forget that the Manusmrti (7. 60 ) 
allows more ministers than seven or eight. Another explanation 
also is possible. In the final remodelling of the Manusmrti from its 
original in verse it is not unlikely that a few changes were made. 
(V) On the strength of the preservation of the complete set of the 
sutra works of Apastamba on srauta, grhya and dharma (also 
of Baudhayana and Hiranyakesin ), it is urged that the 
Manava caratja had a sutra on dharma. The ManavasrautasGtra 
( parts 1-5 edited by Dr. Knaucr and the chayana by Miss Gelder at 
Leipzig in 1921 ) and the Manava-grhyasutra ( edited by Dr. 
Knauer in 1897 an( * recently in the Gaikwad Oriental Series) 
are extant. Buhler admits (S. B.E. vol.25, p. XXXVIII ) that 
the main pilfers of his arguments are the quotations ascribed to 
Manu in the Vasi§thadharmasutra. 

The four sQtras of Vasiftha ( IV. 5-8 ) which are the sheet anchor 
' of Biihler's argument have been dealt with above under Vasistha 
(PP* 5 3-5 £)• If> as Buhler says, the four sutras are one quotation, since 
f iti* occurs at the end of the 8th sutra, then we have here a quotation 
within a quotation, as € iti ' occurs also in sutra 5. But this would 
be absurd. Besides satra 8 is really summarised fron» some Brihmaga 
passage, as indicated above. The proper construction of the four 



IS. iftnat^ftorma»Bfra--i)td tY exist t 89 

sfltras is as follows : — The fifth sfctra merely summarises the views 
,oif the Manusmrti to be gathered from Manu V. 41 and 48. The 
word ' Manavam ' stands for the Manusmrti just as it does in the 
Tantravartika and in ViSvarupa. Then the two verses of Manu are 
quoted. In the 8th sutra a Brahmana passage is cited in support of 
the position that sacrificing an animal is not ' killing * ( that leads to sin). 

' As regards the few quotations which cannot be found in the extant 
Manusmrti the following points deserve consideration. The Vasi- 
§thadharmasutra contains numerous verses identical with those of the 
Manusmrti. Most of the quotations attributed to Manu are found 
in the Manusmrti. Hence even if a few quotations are not found in 
our Manu, we cannot at once jump to the conclusion that Vasistha 
had before him not the Manusmrti, but the Manavadharmasutra. 
Besides Btlhler is not right in saying that Vasistha 11. 23, 12.16 
and 23. 43 either contradict or find no counterpart in our Manu 
(S. B. E. vol. 25 p. XXXIV ). Vasistha n. 23 corresponds with 
Manu 3. 243-246. «4« None of the three contradict anything contained 
in the Manusmrti. Vasistha 23 . 43 ( about Sisukrcchra ) has nothing 
corresponding to it word for word in our Manu, but it seems to be 
an echo of Manu n. 211. I4 * In Vasistha 12. 16 ( paryagnikaranam

hy-etan-manuraha Prajapatih ) there is nothing that contradicts tpUr 
Manu ; that half and the preceding verses bear a close correspon- 
dence to Baudhayana Dh. S. I. 4. 2. Similarly BilMe^s argum*$t 
about Manava sloka in the Tristubh metre is not quite sound. . The 
text of Vasistha is far from satisfactory. On the non-occurrence of 
that verse or a corresponding sloka in our Manu no superstructure 
can be built. Vasistha quotes ( 4. 37 ) a sutra or opinion of Gau- 
tama which is not found in the extant Gautamadharmasutra. Vwses 
ascribed to Vasistha in the nibandhas are not found in the prime 4 
text of Vasistha ( vide n. 108 above. ) 

The analogy of the works of the schools of Apastamba and others 
can furnish no proof. There are on the other hand weighty 
grounds for discarding that analogy altogether. It is a remafkable 
fact that excepting the three carayas ( of the Black Yajurveda ) 
of Apastamba, Baudhayana and HiranyakeSin that arose and 
flourished in the southern portion of India, no caraya of 
any of the other Vedas has an extant dharmasutra ascribed 
to the founder of the satra-caraya. An explanation is suggested in 
the following lines. The Brahmanas in southern India were in the 
very early days of their colonisation surrounded by an alien culture 
and by alien customs. It was necessary therefore to formulate dis- 
tinctly the rules of general conduct for the Aryan community in 
southern India, that studied the Black Yajurveda. The same neces- 
sity did not exist in northern India, where the members of the 
sntracarayas knew their ordinary every day duties very well, and 
were more or less a homogeneous community with the same ideals 
and culture. Therefore in the beginning when manuals of srauta 
and grhya ceremonies were first composed, it was not thought nece- 
ssary to compose set treatises on dharma for each caraya. Some of 
the rules of conduct were embodied in the grhya sutras because 
they were germane to the subjects treated of in them ( such as 
the duties of Brahmacarins and householders, holidays etc. ). 
Works, however, dealing with the general usages prevalent 
among the Aryan community in various parts of northern India 
must have been composed early enough. When the knowledge of 
'\c existence of the complete set of the sutra works in the Apastamba 
^^tegther carayas of the Yajurveda in southern India permeated to 
n0 h \n and central India ; the leaders of the carayas cast about for 
w0 ^hat would complete the works of their carayas and bring 



them in a line with those of Apastamba and others. Therefore the 
various carayas seized upon several dharmasfitras and adopted them 
in their schools for study. This must have occured at a compara- 
tively early date. For Kumarila, as we saw above, enlightens us 
as to what dharmasutras were specially studied in which Vedic 
schools. The fact that, though Gautama and Vasistha are said to 
have been specially studied by the students of the Samaveda and the 
Rgveda respectively, there is hardly anything in these dharmasutras 
that specially connects them with the two Vedas affords some corro- 
boration of the above hypothesis. This assimilation of independent 
dharmasutras into individual sutracaratjas probably took place before 
or in the first centuries of the Christian era. Sahara (on Jaimini I. 3.4) 
seems to make fun of the dharmasutras when he says that the direc- 
tion to observe brahmacarya for forty-eight years was a device of 
those who wanted to hide their impotence ( Gautama 2. 52, Ap. 
Dh. S. I. 1. 2. 11-12, Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 1. speak of brahmacarya 
for 48 years ). This shows that these dharmasutras could not have 
been regarded as very authoritative by all early writers. Jaimini 1. 3. 11 
( according to Sahara) denies the independent authority of Kalpasutras. 
It appears that the Manava school, which according to the cara- 
navyuha was a subdivision of the Maitrayapiya, dwindled in numbers 
very early. Kumarila, who was a most learned and profound 
student of the various branches of Sanskrit literature, nowhere men- 
tioned the Manavadharmasutra as studied by followers of the Black 
Yajurveda, though he mentions Baudhayana and Apastamba as stu- 
died by them. He places the Manusmrti even higher than the 
Gautamadharmasutra and betrays no knowledge of the existence of 
the Manavadharmasutra. Visvarupa who is generally identified 
with Suresvara, the pupil of Sankara, remarks that the Manavacarapa 
is not existent ( or found ). XJ0 

The foregoing discussion will, it is hoped, induce every impartial 
critic to endorse the conclusion that on the materials so far available 
the theory that the Manavadharmasutra once existed and that the 
extant Manusmrti is a recast of that sutra must be held not proved. 

14. The Arthasastra of Kautilya

in 1909 in the Mysore Sanskrit Series and was also translated by him.

with his own commentary called SrimQla. Dr. Jolly and 

Dr. Schmidt edited the text with a valuable introduction and 

the commentary, called Nayacandrika, of Madhavayajvan on 

portions of the text in the Punjab Sanskrit series at Lahore. 

In this work the edition of 19 19 by Dr. Shamasastri has been 

tised. This work has given rise to frequent and furious controversies 

about its authorship, its authenticity and its age and it cannot be said 

that we have heard the last of this din of controversy. Moreover 

this work has inspired besides numerous articles in journals several 

monographs, some of which have somewhat high sounding 

titles, such as Narendranath Law's ' Studies in Ancient 

Indian Polity, ' Dr. P. Banerji's ' Public Administration in 

Ancient India/ Ghosal's € History of Hindu Political Theories, •

Sarkar's * Political Institutions and Theories of the Hindus/ Jayasval's 

'Hindu Polity/ Prof. S. V. Visvanathan's 'International Law in Ancient 

India (1925)'. It is not possible to discuss at great length all the 

problems about Kautilya here. Only a brief statement can be 

attempted. For fuller study reference may be made to the following

Bandopadhyaya's exposition of the social ideal and political theory 

of Kautilya. The Indian Antiquary for 1925 (pp. 175 and 201) 

•gives an exhaustive bibliography on the date of Kautilya. 

• The Kautiliya is the oldest extant work on Artha&stra. 
Though Arthasastra and Dharmasastra are often contradistinguished 
pn account of the difference of the two &stras in ideals and in the 



14. th* Arthatotfra pf kautilya M 

methods adopted to reach them, Arthasastra is really a branch of 
Dharmasastra as the former deals with the responsibilities of kings 
for whom rules are laid down in many treatises on dharma. 1 * 1 
For this reason and the further reason that the Kaufiliya contains 
two sections ( called dharmasthiya and ka^takasodhana ) on the 
administration of justice, the ArthaSastra of Kautilya deserves careful 
consideration in this work. According to the Caranavyuha of 
Saunaka, Arthasastra is an Upaveda of Atharvaveda. The purpose 
of this Sastra as stated in the Kautiliya itself is f to prescribe means for 
securing and preserving (power over ) the earth V* a Yajnavalkya 
distinctly states (II. 21 ) that in case of conflict between Dharma- 
sastra and Arthasastra, the rule is that the former prevails »m. 
Narada also (I. 39 ) says the same thing. x 54 From comparatively 
ancient times Cariakya alias Kautilya or Visnugupta has been 
credited with the composition of a work on Arthaiastra. The 
Kamandakiyanltisara x 55 pays a glowing tribute of praise to Visnu- 
gupta, who, singlehanded, brought about the downfall of Nanda, 
bestowed the earth on Candragupta and distilled from the ocean of 
Arth&stra the quintessence, his work on politics. Kamandaka 
further tells us that he looked upon Vi§ougupta as his guru. 1 * 
The Tantrakhyayika ( H. O. S. vol. 14 ) which is certainly not later 
than 300 A. D. pays homage to Canakya the Great as one of the 
authors of treatises on Politics. «" Dandin in his Dasakumaracarita

(section VIII, p. 131, 2nd edition B. S. Series) says that the teacher 
VigQugupta compressed Dapdaniti for the sake of the Maurya king 
into six thousand slokas and quotes passages from Cajjakya. 1 * 8 Baga 
associates the work of Kautilya with harsh and cruel expedients. 1 ** 
The Pancatantra identifies Canakya and Visnugupta and speaks of 
Canakya as the author of Arthasastra (vide part I. p. 2 ed. by Kielhorn 
part II. p. 65 and part III. 50 ed. by Btthler). Kautilya figures 
very largely in the Purapas (vide Pargiter's 'dynasties of the Kali 
age ' pp. 69-70 and Visnupurana 4. 24. 26-28 ). He has a 
prominent place in the Brhatkatha of Gunadhya, as appears from the 
works of Ksemendra and Somadeva. The Mfchhakatika ( I. 39 
B. S. series ) refers to Canakya. The Mudraraksasa identified 
Cagakya and Kautilya and suggests the derivation of the latter name 
from 'Kutfla' (crooked). 160 Some of the above items of information 
are supported by the personal references contained in the Arthasastra 
itself. At the end of the first chapter of the first adhikaraya, Kautilya 
is said to be the author of the Sastra and at the end of the 10th chapter 
of the second adhikarana Kautilya is said to have laid down the rules 
for royal edicts for the sake of the king. 161 The last verse 16 * tells 
us that he who impatiently wrested the earth from the Nanda king 
composed the work and after the colophon a verse tell us that seeing 
the differing interpretations of bhasyakaras on the Arthasastra, Visnu- 
gupta himself composed the sutra and the bhasya. 

The first question that arises for consideration is the authenticity 
of the work, that is, the question whether it can be the work of the

famous minister of Candragupta Maurya, who was a contemporary 
of Alexander, and who must therefore have flourished about 320 B.C. 
This question very largely depends upon the age of the work. But 
other considerations, more or less of a-subjective character and de- 
pending upon the absence of certain things from the Kautiliya, must 
be dealt with first. Jolly, Keith and Winternitz hold that the extant 
Kautiliya is not the work of the Maurya minister. One argument, 
viz. that a person like Canakya who had to build a vast empire such 
as that of Candragupta and who was bent down with the cares of 
the empire could not have found time to write such a work, may 
be brushed aside as entirely futile, being a purely subjective argu- 
ment. Some persons may say that he could have found time, 
just as Sayapa and Madhava could find in later days, to 
write such a work in the midst of all cares, while others may deny 
the possibility of such a thing. Similarly most of the arguments 
from the silence of the Kautiliya are also quite unconvincing and 
lead to no certain and universally acceptable conclusion. The non- 
mention of Pataliputra or of the empire of Candragupta is of very little 
use in deciding the question of the authenticity of the work. The 
argument of Stein and Winternitz that in Megasthenes* account of 
India no great person named Cajiakya or Kautilya appears and that 
the former's account of the condition of India does not tally with 
that presented by the Kautiliya is of very little weight. We have no 
means for finding out what proficiency Megasthenes had acquired 
in the languages of India so as to be able to hold conversation with 
all sorts and conditions of men. Besides it is well known that Mega- 
sthenes* writings have been handed down in a fragmentary state and 
that he often spins his own yarns. Megasthenes declares the Indians 
to be unacquainted with writing. But no Western scholar would 
now subsribe to the view that writing was unknown in India about 
320 B. C. Dr. Jolly himself has to remark that the idealising ten- 
dency in Megasthenes greatly impairs the trustworthiness of his 
statements ( p. 40, Introduction to Kautiliya ). This question of 
the authenticity of the work is bound up with the question whether 
it can be the work of an individual author or whether it is the pro- 
duct of a school. Hillebrandt vehemently argues that it is the pro- 
duct of a school and Jacobi as vehemently repudiates that hypothesis* 
The great stumbling block according to many scholars in the way of 
regarding Kautilya as the author of the work is the fact that the 
views of Kautilya ait cited by name about 80 times in the work 



9a History cf Dbarmailistra 

itself almost always in opposition to the views of other teachers. 
But there is nothing specially to be wondered at in this. In order 
to avoid looking too egotistic, ancient authors generally put their 
own views in the third person as said by early writers like Medhi- 
tithiand Visvarupa. 16 * It has to be admitted that the first person 
singular also is used by ancient writers, though rarely. 164 Jacobi 
( I. A. for 1 918 p. 188 ) and Keith are both wrong in thinking that 
the view of Kautilya is criticized by Bharadvaja in V. 6. Kautilya 
states his position first and then mentions the view of his prede- 
cessor. 16 * Dr. Jolly (Intro, to Kautiliya p. 44) is wrong in his expla- 
nation of Apadesa (in XV. 1. 166 ). That word is applied to passages 
which mean c this or that author says this or that ' and 
the Kautiliya cites from his own work a case of the 
statement of various views on a certain point. These 
words do not at all indicate that according to the ArthaSastra Kauti- 
lya was a stranger. Keith thinks (J. R. A. S. 1916 p. 135 ) that 
as Kautilya is derived from Kutila, an author will not cite his own 
views under such an epithet. It is not unlikely that Canakya ac- 
quired the epithet Kautilya on account of his methods in dealing with 
the Nandas and that as he did so from no purely selfish motives but 
for ridding the country of such tyrants as the Nandas are represented 
to have been, he might have come to relish the name given to him 
by the people. It has to be noted in this connection that many of 
the writers quoted in the Kautiliya bear nicknames ( such as Pisuna, 
Vatavyadhi, Kauiiapadanta ). This leads to the question as to whether 
the name is Kautilya or Kautalya. Hillebrandt seems to imply 
that all mss. employ the first form, while Pandit 
T. Ganapatisastri says his mss. support the latter form though in the 
first few pages he prints Kautilya. Mss. of the Kadambari, the 
Pancatantra and other works support the form Kautilya and the 
Mudraraksasa does the same by pointedly hinting at the etymology.

A com. on the Kamandaklyanitisara styles the Kautfllya as Kutala- 
bha§ya and Kutala is said to be a gotta. The form Kautalya is said 
to occur in an inscription at Ganesar in Dholka dated Vikrama 
Saihvat 1291 ( i. e. 1234-35 A. D. ). Vide Indian Historical 
Quarterly vol, I. p. 786. It is very difficult to decide between the 
rival claims of the two forms, but it appears that the form of the 
name, Kautalya, is due to a later attempt to solve the difficulty of an 
author parading his views as those of a man nicknamed " crooked , \ 
Whether Kutala or Kautalya was known as a gotra rsi in ancient 
times -is extremely doubtful. Neither the Asvalayana-srauta-sutra 
( Uttara$atka, 6th chap., 10th Kandika ) nor the Apastamba-srauta- 
sGtra ( 24. 5-10 ) mentions Kutala among the several gotra groups. 
In later works on gotras, we find the name in several forms. In the 
Pravaradarpaija of Kamalakara Kautali is said to be one of the 
Jamadagnya-Vatsa group of the Bhrgus (p. 156, edited by P. Client- 
salrao, Mysore ) and Kautilya is assigned to the Yaska group of the 
Bhrgus (p. 158). The Pravaramanjari enumerates the Kautilyas 
(p. 32, of the edition by P. Chentsalrao, Mysore ) among the Yaska 
group of the Bhrgus, also among the Saradvanta group of the Gautamas, 
a branch of the Aftgirasas, (p. 161) and Kautili as one ot the Bhrgus 
(p. 42). We have to remember that so early a writer as Kamandaka 
(who was well known to Bhavabhuti and Vamana's Kavyalaftkarasatra- 
vrtti ) who is assigned to the third centery A. D., and the 
Tantrakhyayika distinctly assign a work on politics to the minister 
of Candragupta. No weighty arguments have been advanced so far 
why this tradition vouched for so early should be disregarded. 
Keith finds it impossible that in the words 'six thousand slokas' used 
by Dandin the word sloka could mean a unit ( in prose) of 32 
letters. But Dandin is evidently repeating the words that occur in 
the Artha&stra itself at the end of the first chapter. ,6 7 

Before proceeding to discuss the age of the Kautiliya, it is 
advisable to say a few words on the form, style and contents of the 
work. The work is divided into is adhikaranas, 150 chapters, 180 
topics and contains 6000 Slokas ( i. e. units of 32 letters). The 
work is in prose interspersed with a few verses. Each chapter has 

^Wl P fflfl I TheBe V ordi °* the Kaufillya must me»n 6000 upits of 93

at the end at least one verse and sometimes more. A 

few verses occur also in the midst of some chapters as in I: 8, 1. 15, 

II. 10, II. 24, V. 6, VII. 5, VII. 6, VII. 9> VII. 13, X. 3, Xm.,4* 

There are about 340 verses excluding mantras. Almost all these 

verses are in the Anustubh metre, only eight verses being in the 

classical Indravajra or Upajati metres ( in II. 9, II. 10 andX. 3 ). In 

our utter ignorance about the literature on Arthasastra prior to Kau- 

tilya it is impossible to say how many ot these verses are borrowed 

and how many are of his own composition. There can be no doubt 

that some of these verses were composed by him ( e. g. the two 

verses in I. 10, where the views of Acaryas are given, and the words 

* etat Kaufilya-darsanam ' occur ). It appears that some verses are 

clearly quotations. For example, the verse ' nasya guhyam' at the 

end of I. 15, and the verse ' samvatsarena patati ' at the end of IV* 

7 are Manu 7. 105 and 2. 180 respectively. The last occurs in Baud* 

Dh. S. II. 1. 62 and also in Vas. I. 22. The two verses in the Upaj 

jati metre in X. 3 c van yajnasartghaih ' and ' navam Saravam * occur 

respectively in the Parasaradharmasastra (chap. III. p. 12 of Jiya* 

nanda, part II ) and in the Pratijna (IV. 3 l68 ). It is noteworthy 

that they are introduced with the words ' apiha Slaukau bhavatali f 

and follow a quotation from or summary of a Vedic passage* 

iwelve verses in VII. 9 are introduced with the words * tatraitad 

bhavati ' and may be quotations. A few of the verses bear a close 

resemblance to verses of other works ; e. g. the verse € prstah pri- 

yahitam bruyat* ( in V. 4 ) which is very similar to Manu. 4. 138. 

In some cases he connects verses with his own words, e. g. the 

words ' kurvatasca ' with ' nasya guhyam ' ( at the end of I. 15 )and 

the last verse of II. 25. The style of the Kautfliya is simple and 

direct. It is not concise like that of the Vedanta or Vyakarana 

sutras. It resembles the dharmasutras of Gautama, Harita and 

SaAkha-Likhita, but is not as archaic as that of Apastamba. 

According to the commentaries the several headings of the 

prakaranas are sutras and the contents of them the bha§ya ( vide 

^ayacandrika pp.137, 143-44 & c -> edited by Dr. Jolly). It 

^ounds in numerous technical and rare terms. It is generally in

accordance with Panini's grammar, though such un-Pininean words 
as * papisthatama ' ( in VII. 1 1 ) rarely occur. It employs the word 
' avyaya* in the masculine ( II. 10 ), while Panini (I. i. 37 ) em- 
ploys *avyayam\ 

The whole work on account of its careful arrangement of topics 
and unity of design impresses one as the product of a single brilliant 
mind. The Kautfliya sheds such valuable light on the social, eco- 
nomic, political and religious life of ancient India and contains infor- 
mation on so many topics that it is not possible to convey any idea 
of its contents in a brief summary. The subjects of the fifteen 
adlrikarayas are : — I. the discipline of the king, sciences to be learnt 
by him, the place of Anviksiki and politics, qualifications of mini- 
sters and purohita and their temptations, the institution of spies, 
council meetings, ambassadors, protection of princes, duties towards 
harem, king's personal safety ; II. about superintendents of various 
state departments, founding villages, pastures and forests, 
forts, duties of the chamberlain ( sannidhata ), the commissioner for 
revenues from forts, country, mines, forests, roads &c. ; accountant- 
general's office ; embezzlement of public funds ; royal edicts ; exa- 
mination of precious stones for the treasury and mines ; superinten- 
dent of gold ( i. e. of coins issued from the mints ) ; superintendent 
of store-house ( of agricultural produce &c), of commerce, of forests, 
of arms, of weights and measures, of tolls, of weaving, of liquor 
houses, of slaughter houses, of prostitutes, of shipping, of cows and 
horses, of the capital and cities ; III. Administration of justice, 
rules of procedure, forms of marriage, duties of married couples, 
stridhana, twelve kinds of sons ; other titles of law ; IV. removal of 
thorns, protection of artisans, merchants, remedies against national

It would be interesting to say a few words separately on the 
chapter about judicial administration . Dr. Jolly has collected together 
the passages of the Kautfllya on judicial administration that bear a very 
close resemblance to the several works on ancient Indian Law ( vide 
Z. D. M. G. vol.67, pp. 51-90). It will be seen therefrom 
that there is the greatest correspondence between the Kautiliya and 
Yajnavalkya. It is no doubt true that many passages from Manu 
and Narada agree closely with those of the Kaufiliya but not to the 
same extent as those of Yajnavalkya. A few striking examples are 
quoted below. 16 * The question then arises whether there is

borrowing and if so who the borrower is. The agreement in 
phraseology is so close that it must be regarded as a case of 
borrowing and in my opinion it is the Yajiiavalkyasmrti that 
borrows. The reasons are many. Yajnavalkya represents on 
numerous points of law a very great advance upon the doctrines of 
Kautilya. Kautilya does not contain distinct directions upon the 
four stages of a law suit ( plaint, reply, proof and judgment ) nor 
upon the threefold aspects of proof ( documents, witnesses, prescrip- 
tion ). Yajnavalkya goes into all these matters. The Kaufiliya 
does not recognise the widow or mother as heir to a sonless man ; 
Yajnavalkya does so. Kautilya does not mention the bandhus as 
heirs ; he hardly says anything about re-union. l i° The Kautiliya 
divides the stridhana of a woman dying during her husband's lifetime 
among her sons and daughters, while Yaj. prefers the daughters to 
the sons. 1 ? 1 It is not necessary to multiply examples. It goes 
without saying that Yajnavalkya represents a far too advanced stage 
of juristic principles than the Kautiliya and so must be later than 
the latter by several centuries* The Kaufiliya agrees very closely 
with Manu also, but considerations of space prevent me from going 
into the points of agreement. There are however numerous funda- 
mental points on which Manu and the Kautiliya disagree. 

Kautilya allows niyoga even in the case of Brahmanas ( last verse 
of III. 6 and at the end of I. 17 about kings). Manu first speaks of 
hiiyoga and then condemns it ( vide 9. 57-63 and 9. 64-68 ). As 
Brhaspati refers to this fact in Manu's work, 1 ? 2 it appears. that the

passages condemning niyoga were put in probably earlier than the 
fitst centuries of the Christian era. Though Kautilya speaks of 
almost the same 18 titles as those in Manu ( 8. 4-7 ) almost under 
the same names, there is a slight difference. Manu has no such 
title as Prakiryaka. Kautilya speaks of upanidhi and extends the 
same rules to Niksepa, while Manu speaks of the title as Niksepa. 
The ancient dharma-sutras do not give the technical names of the 
eighteen titles of law, though some of them do occur therein. Vak- 
parusya and dandaparusya occur in G. Dh. S. (12. 1) and Vas. 
( 17.61 ). Baud, seems to have known the term c Strisafigrahana , 
( Dh. S. II. 2.54 ). Steya occurs in all. Gautama speaks of nidhi 
( Dh. S. 12. 39 ). Manu positively says (9. 155 ) that the son of 
any member of the first three varyas from a Sudra woman does not 
inherit his father's wealth (though the preceding verses 1 51-154 
seem to lay down different rules), while Kautilya allows such a son a 
share when there are sons born to a Brahmaria from wives of higher 
castes or one third when he has no other sons (III. 6). Manu 
expressly mentions the mother and paternal grandmother as heirs 
( 9. 217), while Kautilya appears to ignore them. Manu prohibits 
the remarriage of widows ( V. 161-165 ), while Kautilya allows not 
only widows to remarry, but also wives whose husbands have not 
been heard of for a year or more according to circumstances (III. 4). 
Kautilya allows a wife to desert her husband, if the latter is of a 
bad character, has become a traitor to the king, endangers her life 
or has become an outcaste or impotent 1 ?* ( last verse of III. 2 ). 
Kautilya further seems to have allowed divorce which is unknown 
to any other known lawgiver, but he bases it only on the ground of 
mutual hatred and says that a marriage in the approved forms cannot 
be dissolved 174 (III. 3). Manu is very harsh upon gamblers and 
asks the king to supress gambling and banish gamblers ( 9. 221-224 ), 
while Kautilya only brings gambling under the control of the king 
for the purpose of detecting thieves &c. ( III. 20). Manu first 
allows a Brahmai?a to marry even a Sudra woman and then con- 
demns such a thing (III. 13-19), while Kautilya does not condemn 
such unions. These divergences and others lead us to conclude 






14. The ArthaiWra of Kautilya VI 

*hat the Eautihya is much older than the extant Manusmrti^ which 
is in many matters carried away by puritanic zeal, while its older 
portion is more in harmony with the spirit of the Kautiliya. Therefore 
the Kautiliya is long anterior to the time when the extant Manusmrti 
took its present form. The Kautiliya refers to the opinion of the 
Manavas in five places. Two of the views ascribed to the Manavas 
by Kautilya are the sama as those which Kamandaka (II. 3 and 
.XI. 67 ) ascribes to Manu. According to the Manavas, the vidyas to 
be studied by a prince were three, viz. trayi, varta and dandaniti, what 
is called anviksiki being but a branch of trayi ; and the council of 
ministers was to consist of twelve. The Manusmrti ( 7. 43 ) appears 
to regard the vidyas as four and lays down (7. 54 ) that the Council 
should consist of seven or eight sacivas. Btihler and others on 
account of this difference in the views of the Manavas and the Manu- 
smrti thought that Kautilya was referring to the Manvadharmasutra. 
In my humble opinion the evidence for the existence of a Manava- 
dharmasutra is practically nil, as detailed above in section 13. From 
the references to Svayambhuva Manu and Pracetasa Manu contained 
in the Mahabharata, particularly in the Santi and Anu&s&na parvans it 
appears that there were two works in verse on dharma and politics 
attributed to these two or there was one work containing both. 
These works were subsequently recast as the Manusmrti. It is 
therefore that some difference is noticed between the views ascribed 
to the Manavas aud the extant Manusmrti. Besides there is no real 
conflict in the matter of vidyas. The Manusmrti does not posi- 
tively say that the vidyas are four and not three ; it simply says from 
' whom trayi and the other three are to be learnt. The Manusmrti 
(in 7. 60) allows more ministers than seven or eight. It is 
possible that in recasting several changes .were made. The third 
opinion of the Manavas quoted by Kautilya is about 
the fine to be imposed upon officers of the state occasioning 
loss of revenue ( II. 7 ). The other two views of the Manavas 
quoted are concerned with the fine to be imposed on false witnesses 
and for forcible seizure of jewels 1 ?* &c. It must be admitted that 
in the extant Manusmrti there is nothing exactly corresponding with 
these views. But from this fact no one conclusion alone can be 
drawn. There may be a mistake in. quoting, or there may be inter- 

** ^MiftyviKqii^HApf *n ^w^fjw^vjut ^*i mgiffi wrk 1 in. m * - 11 * 



potations, it may be that some of the verses in the original lf*to* 
smrti have dropped out or that Kautilya is quoting not the <Manu» 
smrti itself, but the views of works based on or explanatory of Mami. 
It is noteworthy that Brhaspati 1 ? 6 contains a verse very similar #0 
the views on sahasa attributed to the Manavas. We shall *ee Mow 
that Brhaspati's work was more or less a supplement of Mann, life 
only authors or schools, besides the Manavas, cited by name in the 
dharmasthlya section are the Barhaspatyas and the Au&nasas. It 4s 
remarkable that the well-known and ancient DharmasQtrakftras like 
Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhayana, Vasi§tha, Harita are nowhere 
quoted by name. It is noteworthy that in the dharmasthlya section 
Kautilya several times quotes the views of acaryas and of some others 
under the word " apare ". Some of these views correspond closely 
with the discussions in the ancient dharmasutras. One of these is 
the -question as to whom the child belongs, to the begetter or to 
him on whose wife it is begotten. Kautilya first quotes the view 
of the acaryas that it belongs to the husband of the mother of 
the child, then says that some hold that it belongs to the 
begetter, while Kautilya holds that it belongs to both. 1 " It is 
to be noted here that both Baud, and Ap. say that according to 
.theiBriihflKUEias the sons belong to the begetter, while Vasiftha says 
there is a dispute on the point, both views being supported by 
ancient authorities. Gautama speaks of both views and at last ( 18. 13 
Mdvoyorva" ) seems to come to the same conclusion as Kautilya. It 
its not unlikely that Kautilya has in mind this discussion in the 
rBfcarmasatras*nd also in Manu( 9. 48-54 where the view is that 
mbe child 1 bek>ngs to the husband of the woman ). Some nof the 
other views attributed to acaryas are that a woman could visit the 
►houses <rf her husband's relations, of prosperous men, of village head- 
men, of female ascetics &c. (III. 4); that very poor men could 
divide even waterpots ata partition (III. 5); that the master who did 
wok employ: a servant ready to work according to agreement had to 

tooted in «*nCT*iw on mfal. 



|»y~thfe wages agsttd upoa a& if the work had beta finished (compare 
Yift* V.. *$7) ; he who forcibly confined a man or woman or who 
by force released another from imprisonmnent, was to be fined between 
jqo and* iooo ( HI. 17 ) ; that disputes of a remote date shall not be 
Complained of and that he who is the first to complain wins, since 
on* mn$ ( to court ) as one cannot bear the pain ( III. 19 ) ; that in 
a complaint by one gambler against another, the successful party has 
to pay die fine called pftrvasahasa and the defeated party the fine 
called madhyas&hasa ( 1H. ao >. 

Tile foregoing discussion about the dharmasthfya section shows 
that i» the sphere of the administration of justice, Kautilya is far in 
advance of the dharmasutras of Gautama, Apastamba and Baudhayana 
and so is much later than these ( though in certain matters such as 
thft fights of women to succeed to ipales he closely agrees with 
CrSLUtytna and Apastamba), while he is earlier than the extant 
Manusmrti ( though not earlier than the oldest kernel oi the 
Manusmrti ) and very much earlier than Yajnavalkya. 

The question of the date of the Kautillya can be settled only 
4pgroyin??tely and for that we have to rely only on the internal 
evidence. The external evidence does not carry us far ; we can 
only *ay that the Eautiliya is certainly not later than the and century 
A* D., since K&mandaka, the Tantrakhyayika, and Bana, speak 
of k with admiration. No one claims it to be earlier than 300 B. G 
t£vea Keith who assigns it a late date and cannot pl*ce i* earlier than 
iOO B. C at the most has to admit ( J R A S i$z6, p. 1 j$ ) that for 
* Precise date we have no real ground. 

The Eautiliya quotes five schools by name : Manavah ( five 
times ), Barhaspatyah ( 6 times ), Au&masah (7 times ), Par^arth 
( 4 times ), Ambhiyah ( once ) and the following individual authors ; 
Katylyana ( x ), Kinjalka ( 1 ), Kaugapadama ( 4 ), Ghotakamukha 
( 1 ), ( Dirgha ) Carayana ( 1 ), Para&ra ( 2 ), PKuna ( 6 ), 
PUunaputra ( 1 ), Bahudantiputra ( 1 ), Bharadvaja ( 7 , once as 
Kanaka Bharadvaja ), Vatavyadhi ( 5 ), Vi&lak§a ( 6 ). He either 
differs from all these authors or they differ from each other in all 
the pfaces where they are cited. AM the individual authors that are 
cited only once occur on the same page (except Bahudantiputra). 
H: e quotes the views pf 4tfow QYtt f}(ty times «nd in es^h case

collectively. Even the Nirukta quotes certain* views as those of 
icaryas. Kautilya is cited about 80 times. The Kamastttra . of 
"VatsySyana mentions a Ghofakamukha and a Carayana. Whether 
they are identical with the authors cited by Kautilya is extremely 
doubtful. The Mahabharata mentions among writers on Dandanlti 
the following who occur in the Kautiliya also : — Brhaspati, Manu; 
Bharadvaja, Visalaksa, Sukra ( the same as Usanas ) and Indra 
( probably Kautilya's Bahudantiputra ), whose abridgment , of 
Brahma's work is called Bahudantaka in the Santiparva ( chap, 59 ). 

According to the Nayacandrika, PiSuna, Bharadvaja, Kaunapa- 
danta and Vatavyadhi stand for Narada, Dronacarya, Bhisma and 
Uddhava respectively ( pp. 73, 69, 74, 91 ). 

The Mahabharata mentions other writers on politics, viz. 
Gaurasiras, KaSyapa, Utathya, Vamadeva, Vasuhoma, Kamandaka, 
(Santiparva 123. 11) and a few others which are not found in the 
Kautiliya. 

The Kautiliya knows the four Vedas, the charms and incanta- 
tions of the Atharvan, the six atigas y includes under itihasa, Puraijas, 
Dharmasastra and Arthasastra ; it knows the SaAkhya, Yoga and 
Lokayata 1 ? 8 schools of thought. It mentions MauhUrtikas, 
Kartantikas ( astrologers ), Jupiter and Venus. It refers to dhatu- 
&stra ( Metallurgy ). Sanskrit was the official language and in the 
Sasanadhikara it mentions such g u%as of composition as madhurya, 
audarya, spastatva, which show the beginnings of the Alaihkara 
sastra. There is nothing to wonder at in this. In the second century 
A. D. we have the inscription of Rudradaman, which enumerates 
the gugas of Kavya. The Kautiliya does not mention edicts on 
stone or copper. It refers to Vai&kakalajnana ( II. 27 ). The 
Kautiliya closely agrees with the Kamasutra in several respects, and 
the two works contain several identical passages ( such as the list of 
kings that fell victims to intrigues and about trivarga ). Keith 
argues from this that the Kautiliya and the Kamasutra are not 
separated by a long interval and that it is a late work. Dr. Jolly 
also is of the same opinion (p. 24 Intro, to Artha&stra ). If the 
Kamasutra held up the Kautiliya as its model, then the two works 
would certainly look very much alike. . There are points of difference

14. The ArthatlUtra tf KautUya U» 

between the two works, e. g. they differ in their attitude towards 
flesh-eating and the KamasUtra speaks of planetary influence and 
lagna, while the Kautiliya is silent on these points and only condemns 
in general terms the consulting of stars. We must note here that 
the Kautillya ( IX. 4 ) speaks of consulting nakjatras, which were 
known from the earliest Vedic period and some of which were 
looked upon as auspicious for sacrificial purposes even in the 
Satapatha Brahmana (S. B. E. vol. 44, pp. 1-2 ) and the Srauta and 
Grhya sQtras. The Kautfliya follows the Vedafiga Jyoti§a in the 
system of a yuga of five saihvatsaras, in prescribing two inter- 
calary months in a yuga and in saying that at the end of one ayana 
the variation between the length of the day or the night comes to 
six muhurtas ( vide II. 20 ). Keith argues that the £lokas in the 
Kautillya are more classical than even those of the Ramayapa 
and that it contains correct Trisfubh stanzas which are 
wanting in the Bfhaddevata ( a work of the 4th century B. C. ). 
But this argument can produce no impression on those scholars 
who ascribe the Ramayana to the 5th century B. C. or earlier. Nor 
is the date of the Bjrhaddevata beyond the pale of discussion. There 
is no consensus of opinion among scholars as to the exact time 
when classical slokas and correct Tri§tubhs first came into vogue. 
It is to be noted that the Kautillya defines pada as varnasaftghata 
and not as in Pacini ( sup-tiftantarh padam ). 

. Among the countries and peoples frequently mentioned by 
Kauplva, several are interesting. He speaks of silks from the land 
of the Cinas 1 " and blankets from Nepal. Keith says that the name 
Cina being derived from the Thsin dynasty in China ( which began 
its rule in 247 B. C. ) this would show that the Kautillya could not 
have been composed about 300 B. C. No one however knows how 
the word Cina was derived and besides as Keith admits the passage 
may be an interpolation. He speaks of the Saiigha of the Vr$$is 
(1.6) and the Sretfis ( corporations ) of K§atriyas in the countries 
of Kambhoja and Surasfra that lived by varta (agriculture and trade ) 
and by the profession of fighting and the corporations of the Licch- 
civika, Vjrjika, Mallaka, Madraka, Kukura, and the Kurupaficalas 
that livepn the title 'raja' (XI. 1). Some of these tribes such as the 
Licchavis, Vjrjis ( Vajjis in Pali ) and Mallas are well-known from 
ancient Buddhist works. What i s meant by ' rajafobdopajfvffafr * 



it; not quite clear, k probably means thai th« organisation of tfa* 
Eicchavis and others was on democratic lines and that there wa* 
vecyt keen competition for the honour of being elected the chief or 
president of those corporations, the latter being designated ' raja \ ,§ * 
Tfa Nayacandrika* explains that they hear the pcoudr designation of 
c :4j*' bui are penniless (.and so can be easily employed in military 
service as mercenaries ). We are told that the breed of horses from 
Kjkmbhoja, Sindhu, Aratta, and Vanayu wa& the best and that 
Bahlika, Papeya, Sauvira, and Taitala breeds were of middle quality. 
Th* Kautiliya speaks- of Mleccha tribes and tells us that among 
. them one's own children could be sold or pledged without incurring 
punishment (IH. ij ). 

There is hardly any distinctive reference to things Buddhist except 
cine passage ( III. 20 ) where a fine of one hundred ( pavas ) is 
prescribed for him who invited to dinners in honour of gods or Manes 
a Buddhist (Sakya), an Ajivaka, a sudra ascetic. 1 * 1 This shows that 
the work was written at a time when Buddhism was yet not a wide- 
spread religion and had not secured an honourable place among the 
people. The Ajivika was a well-known sect in ancient India, said 
to have been founded by Makkhali Gosala (vide V. A. Smith's A6oka, 
ppr. 134, 198 of edition of 1909, 1. A. I9r2, p. 286, 'Dialogues of 
Bpdtdfta' I, p. 71, n. 1, Journal of Bihar & Orissa Society, 1926, 
pp. 53-62). Asoka bestowed some caves on them. Kautilya says that 
weights should be made of iron or of stones from Magadha and 
Mtfkala ( country near the sources of the Narmada ).** 

It is extremely doubtful whether the Kautiliya knew the extant 
text of the Mahabharata. Most of the stories used as illustrations 
in the Kautiliya occur in the Mahabharata ( e. g. Aila, Duryo- 
dhana, Haihaya Arjuna, Vatapi, Agastya, Ambarisa, Suyitra 
i. e. Nala ). But in some cases there is slight divergence 
between the two works, e. g. Janamejaya is said to 
have perished through having attacked Brahmanas in anger, 
while the Mahabharata (XII. 150 ) gives a different version; 
Kautilya says ( IV. 8 ) that Ma^davya* though not a thief, declared

himself to *be a thief While the MahfibhUata (I. 107. 9) <stys that 
he spoke nothing; Kautilya mentions Jayatsena as the oppo- 
nent of Nala ( VHI. 3 ) in gambling, while die Mahabharata gives 
his name as Pu§kara ; the Mahabharata and the Ramayana do n*t 
know that a J&mdagnya ruled long as a king.* 8 * Kautilya seems to 
have known the Puranas. He says ( III. 7 ) that sata and mggadha 
of the Puranas are quite different 18 * from members of the mixed 
castes called sata and magadha and includes Purana ( I. 5 ) among 
the subjects of royal study grouped under the head of itibasa. 

Kautilya exhibits a wonderful knowledge of herbs and drugs 
and Dr. Jolly thinks that his Materia Medica is more extensive than 
even Su£ruta's. But the dates of Caraka and Susruta are far from 
being settled and no approximately certain conclusion can be drawn 
from the drugs mentioned in the Kautiliya. Kautilya speaks .of 
'rasada' (one who administers mercurial poison) and prescribes 
banishment for those who trade in or administer 'rasa 9 for money in 
order to do away with a person secretly (IV. 4.) In II. 13 he speaks 
of gold that is € rasa-viddha' (amalgamated with mercury) and in 
II. 12 of liquids containing gold (rasah Kincanikab ) and of Hin- 
guluka. Dr. Jolly thinks that this knowledge of metallurgy and 
alchemy is of Graeco-Syriac origin and so the Kautiliya is a work of 
the third century A. D. 

It is of great importance to note that Kautilya lays down (II.4) that 
in the midst of the fort were to be constructed the temples of &V4, 
Vaisravaria, the Asvins, Lak$mi and Madira (Durga ?) and niches were 
to be set apart for Aparajita, Apratihata, Jayanta and Vaijayanta and 
that the tutelary deities of the gates were to be Brahma, Indra, 
Yama and Senapati (i.e. Skanda ). We know from the Mahabha- 
§ya 185 ( Kielhorn Vol. II. p. 429 ) on Panini (V. .3. 99 - c jivikarthe 
capafiye ' ) that the Mauryas set tip images out of greed for money 
and that in its day images of Siva, Skanda and Vi&kha were 
worshipped.

. The foregoing discussion clearly shows that the Kaufiliya has 
certainly an ancient atmosphere about it, and that all that has so far 
been gathered from it agrees with its traditional date of 300 B. C. 
and no cogent arguments have been yet brought forward that would 
compel us to assign it a date later than the above by six centuries. 

Two commentaries on the Kautiliya have been brought to light 
so far, one composed by Bhaftasvamin being called Pratipadapancika 
and. the other the Nayacandrika of Madhavayaj van. Both are frag- 
ments. The first was published in the Journal of the Bihar and 
Orissa Research Society ( 1925-1926, vol. XI and XII ) by Messrs. 
K. P. Jayasval and A. Banerji-sastri. The com. is incomplete and 
begins with the 8th adhyaya of the 2nd adhikarana and reaches up 
to the 36th adhyayaof the adhikarana. The commentary on the 
whole work must have been very extensive, as the portion already 
printed on a part of the 2nd adhikarana alone occupies 214 pages. 
This commentary quotes the explanations of previous commentators 
in the words 'anye', * apare \ It quotes several slokas of Brhaspati 
on the blemishes of diamonds and on prakasa-taskaras. The com- 
mentary Nayacandrika contained in Dr. Jolly's edition (Lahore) also 
is incomplete and begins with the 7th adhyaya of the 7th adhikarana 
and breaks off in the 4th adhyaya of the 12th adhikarana. It also 
refers to the views of its predecessors in the words ( kecit * &c. ( vide 
pp. 35, 61, 62, 104, 115, 131, 191). It discusses various readings 
(pp. 136, 183,188, 193 &c). 

Dr. Shamasastri includes in his edition 571 sutras attributed to 
Capakya. Their relation to the Kautiliya is a subject which 
requires careful investigation. In my own opinion they are later 
than the Kaufiliya. It would be beyond the scope of this work to 
enter into details. ) JVide Dr. Jacobi's article in Indian Historical 
Quarterly, vol. III., pp. 669-676. 

There are several ntti collections attributed to Carjakya and pub-

1 5. Vaikhanasa-dharma-prasna 

This work has beem published in the Trivandrum Sanskrit 
Series by Pandit T. Ganapati Sastri ( 1913 ). 

Mahadeva in his*commentary called VaijayantI (Anandasrama 
ed. ) on the Satyasadha Srautasfitra speaks of six Srauta sQtras of 
the Black Yajurveda, viz. Baudhayana, Bharadvaja, Apastamba, 
Hiraoyakesin, Vadhala and Vaikhanasa, and frequently cites 
passages from the Vaikhanasa-srautasutra. In the Caragavyfiha of 
Saunaka, Vadhula and Vaikhanasa are not mentioned. But that 
Vaikhanasa was a very ancient writer follows from the references 
contained in the ancient dharma works. In Gautama the word 
' Vaikhanasa' occurs ( Dh. S. III. 2 ) as the name for the order of 
forest hermits ( vanaprastha ) and in another stttra ( III. 26 ) he 
lays down that (ire was to be consecrated according to the 
Srama^aka, 186 which latter is explained by Haradatta as Vaikhanasa 
Sastra. Baudhayana ( Dh. S. II. 6. 17 ) has the same sutra 18 * and 
defines a Vaikhanasa as one who follows the rules of conduct laid 
down in Vaikhanasa Sastra ( Dh. S. II. 6. 16 ). The Vasi§tha Dh. 
S. ( 9. 10 ) also has the same sutra as Gautama ( Dh. S. III. 26 )• 
The Manusmrti( VI. 21 ) speaks of the Vanaprastha as one who 
abides by the views of Vaikhanasa ( Vaikhanasamate sthitab )• 

The Vaikhanasadharmaprasna is divided into three prasnas, each 
prasna being subdivided into khagdas. There are in all 41 khaQ<Jtt« 
The work is a small one. The contents of the work are :- 1. the 
four varyas and their privileges, and the four diratnas ; duties of 
brahmacarin ; four kinds of brahmacdrins ; duties of the house- 
holder ; four kinds of grhastha, vdrtdvjtti ( subsisting by agriculture ), 
salina, yayavara and ghoracarika ; forest anchorites ; vanaprasthas 
are either sapatnlka (accompanied by their wives) or apatnflca 
( not so accompanied ) ; Sapatnlka are of four sorts, Audumbara, 
Vairinca, Valakhilya and Phenapa; apatnika Vanaprasthas; of 
four kinds of bhikfus, viz. kutfeaka, bahudaka, hamsa and paramahaihsai 
sakama ( performed with desire of wordly gain) and ni$kama 
(not so performed) karma; pravpti and nivrtti; three kinds of

Yogins and their subdivisions ; II. the details of the Sramanaka rites of 
the vanaprastha ( khaijdas 1-4 ) ; duties of the forest hermit ; details 
of joining the order of saihnyasins ( khandas 6-8 ) ; age for samnyasa 
( above seventy or when childless or widower); every day duties 
and observances of saihnyasins ; about Ocamana and Samdhya ; 
saluting ( abhivadana ) of all relatives, male and female ; holidays 
for study ( anadhyaya ) ; bath and Brahmayajna ; rules about 
taking food ; forbidden and permitted food ; III. rules of conduct for 
grhastha (khandas 1-3 ), rules of the road ; purification of golden 
and other metallic things ; purification of other things ; about 
vanaprastha ; bhikfu ; burial of a samnyasin ; Narayanabali on the 
death of a samnyasin, tarpmja in the case of sarhnyasins with twelve 
names of Visiiu, Kesava &c. and with water ; amtloma and 
pratiloma ; the intermediate castes ; Vrfityas, their origin ; name and 
means of subsistence (khandas n-15 ). 

The Vaikhanasadharmaprasna appears by its style and its 
contents to be a work of comparatively later date than the dharma- 
sdtras of Gautama and Baudhayana. It is probably a recast of older 
materials. It contains the names of more mixed castes than the 
dharmasutras and than even some of the later smrtis. The present 
work seems to have been either written or retouched by a devotee of 
Visriu. * Faith in and devotion to Visnu or Narayana loom very 
large here (I. 5. 5 narayana-parayanah, I. 7. 6 and 9; II. 4-5 
bhaktya Visnum dhyayan, III. 7. 3 Narayanaparam brahmeti 
srutah, III. 9. 3 Visnoralayaparsve ). It speaks of the eight aftgas 
of Yoga (I. 10. 9 ), of the Ayurveda with its eight aiigas and of 
some treatise on evil spirits ( bhutatantra III. 12.7). It refers to 
the views of some in the word c eke* ( I. 7. 4. and II. 9. 10 ). It 
speaks of the Sramanaka fire ( in I. 6. 2 and I. 7. 3-4 ). It does not 
allow sarimyasa to Ksatriyas (I. 1. 11). Vikhanas is cited as an 
authority (II. 5. 9 and III. 15. 14). 

Btihler found a ms. of the Vaikhanasasutra, consisting of a 
grhya in seven prainas, three prasnas of dharma ( the same as 
described above ) and a fourth on pravaras. In the grhya a 
reference to Budhavara occurs ( R. and S. p. 9 ). Dr. Caland in his 
paper on Vaikhanasa-sutra holds that the Manusmrti borrows from 
Vaikhanasagfhya and that the author of the latter was saturated 
with the idiom of Dravidian languages ( vide Prof. Keith's review in 
Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, 1927, p. 623). Dr. Calaijd's 



16. Atri 10? 

view about Manu is entirely wrong as will appear from the section 
on Manu. Vide Th. Bloch in ' uber das Grhya-und Dharmasutra 
der Vaikhanasa * ( Lipzig, 1896 ). 

Other Sutra Works on Dharma. 

It will be proper to say a few words about some other sQtra 
works on dharma thar are only available in mss. or are to be 
reconstructed from quotations in the digests. It is by no means 
to be supposed that these works that will be spoken of here 
were composed as early as those of Gautama, Apastamba and 
others or were composed before the extant Manu and Yajnavalkya. 
But as the chronology of all ancient works on dharma is somewhat 
in a nebulous state, it is best to treat here of all works written in the 
sutra style, even though in individual cases they may really belong 
to a later age than the works composed entirely in vercc. They 
will be taken up in alphabetical order ( Sanskrit ). 

16. Atri 

That Atri was an ancient writer on dharma follows from a refer 
ence to him in Manu ( III. 16 ) as holding the view that a dvijdti 
taking as wife a sudra woman became fallen (patita ). In the Deccan 
College collection there are several mss. ( Nos. 185-187 of A 1881-82) 
of the Atreyadharmasastra in nine adhytyas. They treat of gifts, 
prayers ( japya ) and tapas by which men are freed from all sins. 
Some of the chapters are in mixed prose and verse. The first three 
chapters are entirely in verse and some of the verses ( such as eka- 
ksaram param brahma ) occur in the Manusmrti. The fourth opens 
with a long sutra, which, in style, resembles later bhasyas and com- 
mentaries. 188 The 5 th also is in verse and contains several verses 
found in Vasistha ( Dh. S. 28. 1, 4, 6 ). The sixth speaks of 
the specially holy hymns and verses of the Veda. Some of the 
verses here are the same as Vasistha (28. 10-11). The seventh refers 
to secret prayascitias and the very first sutra after the opening words 
speaks of several non-Aryan tribes such as the Sakas, Yavanas, Kam- 






*¥B8 History (rf Dhcmnatadra 

bhojas, Balhlkas, Khasas, VaAgas and Parasa ( Persians ? ) &c. It is 
to be noted that the same sQtra ( with slight variations ) is quoted 
as Atri's by Aparftrka ( on Yaj. III. 266 p. 1 123 ). The 7th and 8th 
chapters are in mixed prose and verse. The 9th is in verse and speaks 
of Yoga and its afigas. It refers to the fact that &isupala, son of 
Damagho$a, because in his hatred of Govinda he always thought of 
the latter, went to heaven. The same sutra work is noticed in 
I. O. Cat., pp. 380-81, Nos. 1305 and 1306. 

There are several works styled Atri-smjti or samhita in the mss. 
One of them is in six chapters on secret prAyascittas, gifts, pitpuedha 
and acara ( vide I. O. Cat., p. 381, No. 1308 ). There is another 
work styled Atrisamhita printed in Jivananda's collection ( part L 
pp. 13-46 ). It contains about 400 verses and deals with the follow- 
ing topics : — importance of honouring guru, duties of four castes ; 
purifications of several malas ; virtues of Brahmanas such as £auca, 
anasQya ; definition of if (a and parta, ten yamas and niyamas ; im« 
portance of sons ; adopted sons, praya&ittas for taking forbidden food 
or drink and for other transgressions, impurity on birth and death ; 
candrayana, Kjxra, Santapana ; gifts ; purifications from avoidable 
contacts with rajasvala &c; Sraddha and the Brahmanas to be invited 
for it. 

In this work Atri is himself cited as an authority. Other 
authors and works quoted are : Apastamba (p. 30 ), Yama ( p. 41 ), 
Vyasa(p. 24), Saiikha (pp. 22, 35), Satatapa (p. 35). The 
Vedanta, Saftkhya, Yoga, Puranas, Bhagavatah (p. 45 ) are 
mentioned. It contains (on p. 14 ) the verse c sadyah patati 
maftsena ' which is found in Vasistha Dh. S. ( 2. 27 ) with the 
words *athapyudaharanti\ There are other verses also which 
occur elsewhere e. g. 'atha cenmantravid' occurs in Vasisfha 11. 20, 
f tryaharfi sayam tryaham pratah' ( p. 23) is also Manu XI. 21 1. 
On p. 26 occur the words < atrapyudaharanti* and so what follows 
is a quotation. On p. 32 there are three verses in another metre, 

Atri's verse about adoption x '° is quoted as the first authority on 
adoption in the Dattakamlmaftsa. He mentions the seven antyajas 
to be the washerman, the shoemaker, nafa, buruda, kaivarta 



14. Mri 1(A 

( fisherman ), meda, and bhilla ( p. 29 ). He further says x *« 
that there is no question of untouchability in fairs, marriage 
seasons, in Vedic sacrifices and in all festivals. He says that 
Brahmanas from Magadha, Mathura and three other places are not 
honoured ( at a £raddha ) though as learned as Brhaspati.'? 3 

The work mentions the signs of the Zodiac, Kanya and the 
Scorpion ( p. 43 ), and hence was not composed before the first 
centuries of the Christian era. 

In Jivananda there is a Laghu-Atri (part I, pp. 1-12) in 6 chapters 
and about 120 verses, dealing with the means of being freed from sins 
( such as praniyama, sacred formula, gifts &c. ), with purifications 
from impurity on death and birth, with gifts. It mentions Manu. 
In the fourth chapter there are about ten lines in prose, There are 
numerous verses that occur also in the Vasisjha-dharmasutra, e. g. 
Vas. 26. 8-9 and 16-18 occur on p. 3 ; Vas. 28. 11-16 occur on pp. 
4-5. It is difficult to say who the borrower is. 

There is a Vrddhatreyasmrti in Jivananda ( part I. pp. 47-59 ) 
in five chapters and about 140 verses. This closely resembles the 
Laghu-Atri-smrti described above. In the commencement both 
have the same six verses beginning with 'bhagavan kena danena* 
and the works have many verses in common. In the fourth 
chapter of both the same prose passages occur. 

ViSvarGpa on Yaj. (III. 257 ) quotes two verses from Atri on 
praya&itta which are found in none of the three works described 
above. 1 >* 

In the Mahabharata ( Anu&sana 65. 1 ) Atri is credited with the 
view that those who make a gift of gold give (practically) all

objects. This bears a close resemblance to two verses that occur in 
Laghvatri ( Jivananda part I. p. 5 ) and Vrddhatri ( part I. p. 51 ). I9 + 

17. Usanas. 

That USanas wrote a work on politics follows from several circum- 
stances. The Kautiliya quotes the AuSanasah seven times. It is 
almost certainly referring to a work. That work contained direc- 
tions on the administration of justice also, as Kautflya speaks of 
Au&nasa method of partition ( in allowing a tenth additional share 
to the eldest son, III. 6 ), as Ausanasah prescribed fines in cases 
where witnesses proved stupid &c. (HI. 11) and fines for forcible 
seizure of jewels &c. ( III. 17). The Mahabharata, Santiparva 1 * 3 
(chap, 56, 29-30 and 57. 3 ) refers to a work on politics by USanas 
and quotes three verses, the last being found in Sabha 55. 14. In 
other places also we have a Nitisastra ascribed to Bhargava ( Santi 
210. 20 ) and certain verses are ascribed to him ( Santi 57, 40-41 
and 139, 70-71 ). Vide also Anusasana 39, 8-9 and Sabha 62. n -12. 
The Nitiprakasika of Janamejaya refers to a succession of teachers of 
politics from Brahma down to Janamejaya and says that Sukra was

one of those who abridged the enormous extent of raja&stra. 1 ' 6 
The Mudraraksasa (I. p. 71 Telang's ed, ) also speaks of Ausanasi 
Dandaniti. Visvarupa(on Yaj. I. 307) asks the king to appoint 
ministers in accordance with the views propounded in the sastras of 
Brhaspati and Usanas and quotes a long passage in prose from Bjrhas- 
pati in which the sastras of Manu, Brhaspati and Usanas are joined 
together. This work on politics probably contained verses also. 
Medhatithi on Manu (7. 15 ) quotes two verses speaking of eight 
activities of a king. 1 * 6 * So also on Manu 8.50 Medhatithi cites from 
Usanas the words ' prakrtinam balarh raja, ' which are an Anustubh 
pada. This sutra work on politics by Usanas has not yet been dis- 
covered. The Tandya-Mahabrahmana says that Kavya Usanas was 
the purohita of the Asuras ( 7. 5. 20 ). 

In the Deccan College collection there are two mss. of an Ausa- 
nasa-dharmasastra in prose with a few verses, vi\. No. 644 of Visrambag 
( i ) and No. 191 of A 1881-82. The first contains only two folios 
( 2 and 4 ) and the available portion begins in the midst of the 2nd 
chapter. In the second ms. also the first folio is wanting and there 
arc gaps in the fourth chapter. It is noteworthy that the second 
folio of the second ms. begins just at the beginning of the 2nd folio 
of the first. The work is a brief one ( 8 folios ) in seven adhyayas. 
Their contents are:— II. impurity on birth and death ; purification of 
certain things in certain ways such as with water, ashes &c; III. the 
four varnas and the mixed castes such as Rathakara, Ambastha, 
Sflta, Ugra, Magadha &c, the Vratyas ; IV. no bodily injury to be 
done to Brahmana ; prayascittas for killing a Brahmana or a man of 
the other varnas and for other Mahapatakas, prayascitta [or eating

Brhaspati, Sukra, BhSradvSja, Gaurasiras and Veda-Vyasa abridged 
respectively to 25000, 10000, 6000, 3000, 1000, 700, 500 and 300 adhySyas 
and that Janatnejaya abridged even the last. 

These are quoted also by Kgs; on Manu VII. 154.

the flesh of certain animals and for eating certain plants like garlic, 
pjftyascitta for adultery; discussion whether a Brahmapa could marry 
i $udra woman; prayascittas for killing various beasts and birds ; four- 
teen^ vidyas ; V. Sraddhakalpa ; what Brahmanas are pankti-pdvana ; 
details of sraddha, food and flesh at sraddha; who are unfit to 
be invited at iraddha ; VI. what things a Brahmana could not sell ; 
VII. punishments for the Mahapatakas; what are pure things at all 
times. Some of the views of the AuSanasa-dharma&stra are worth 
special notice. The son of a Brahmana, K§atriya or VaiSya from a 
wife of the varpa immediately next to it belonged to the caste of the 
father, w No sin or punishment attached to one if one killed an atatayi 
armed Brahmana. The fourteen vidyas are said to be the six aUgas 
and the four Vedas, Mimamsa, Nyaya, dharmasastra and Purana. 1 * 8 

The work very often quotes the views of others with the words 
f eke' ; for example it says ' the impurity on birth is ten nights for 
the parents of the child, but according to some only for the mother.' 1 ** 
The son of a Brahmana from asudra woman is called paraiava, but 
according to some he is ni$ada. The whole of the portion in the 
ms. about the mixed castes bears a very close resemblance to Baudha- 
yana ( Dh. S. I. 9 ) except in a few particulars. 300 At the end of all 
chapters from the second ( except the third ) there are verses and also 
in the midst. There are verses introduced with the words ' there is a 
sloka on this point ' ( bhavati catra slokah ) or with the words 
c api codaharanti \

There are about 45 verses in the work, the 7th and last chapter 

being almost entirely in verse. As the mss. are corrupt and full of gaps, 

it is often difficult to find out whether a particular passage is prose 

or verse. In several verses the words * Manur abravld ' occur and in 

one place ' tan manor anusasanam \ The latter closely agrees with 

Manu. Several verses are common to Manu and Usanas. The verse 

'gurutalpe bhagah karyah' ( Manu 9. 237 ) occurs in the ms. So 

also the verse 'yena yena cidahgena ' occurs in both. 40 * The 

words of Manu ( V. 78 ) * bale desantarasthe' are expressly quoted 

with the words 'Manur-aha \ There are many other verses which, 

though not cited expressly as from a particular author, are found in 

other ancient works. For example, the verse ' apafr suddha bhumi- 

gatab' is Manu 5. 128 and Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 57. The half verse 

'karuhastah sucir nityam' is Manu 5. 126 and Baud. Dh. S. I. 5.48. 

The verse ' yadekaratreiia karoti papam ' occurs in Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 9. 

27. n ) and Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 42. The verse ' tryaham pratas 

tryaham naktam ' is Manu XI. 2 1 1 . It is a remarkable fact that some 

of the verses in this dharmasutra agree closely with the verses in 

the Usanas-smrti in verse, published by Jivananda, e. g. the verse 

' dattva tu Vedanatyartham ' occurs on p. 525 and.the verse 'niman- 

tritastu yo vipro adhvanam sarhprapadyate'on p. 527. Even the 

prose passages bear a close resemblance to the versified smjti on many 

points, e. g, the prose passages about the duration of the satisfaction 

of the Manes by the otl'eriugs of the flesh of various animals occur 

almost in the same words in the versified smrti of Usanas (Jivananda* 

part I, p. 522 )•

quotes in one place the divergent views of Vasistfia, 20 * Harita, 
Saunaka, and Gautama on the question whether a Brahmana could 
'marry a sudra woman. The view of Vasisj:ha(as quoted in the ms.) 
is that a Brahmana could take to wife girls of all the four castes, 
but in the printed text of Vasisfha (I. 24 ) a Brahmaiia is allowed to 
marry girls of the three higher castes only. It is possible that the 
ancient reading of Vasisfha's text was 'catasrah* ( as quoted in the 
AuSanasa ) which was changed into *tisrah\ The passage reminds 
us of Manu III. 16 ( Sudra vcdi patatyatreh ), but the views 
ascribed to Saunaka and Gautama in the ms. differ from those 
ascribed to them in Manu. In another passage Vasistha's views 
seem to be quoted. 20 * 

From quotations in Haradatta's commentary on Gautama and from 
the Smrticandrika it appears that they had access to a sutra work of 
Uianas dealing with all branches of dharma, viz., acara, vyavahara 
and prayascitta. For example, the Smrticandrika quotes prose 
passages of Usanas on anadhyaya (I. p. 59 ), on dantadhavana (I. p. 
106 ) and Haradatta quotes a prose passage on anadhyaya ( on Ap. 
Dh. S. I. 3. 10. 1 ) and a prose passage on the fine for a ksatriya 
abusing a sudra ( on Gau. Dh. S. 12. 10) and on Niyoga (on 
Gau. Dh. S. 18. 5 ). These passages are not found in the ms. 
But there are others that are found. For example, the Smriti- 
candrika quotes two passages, which occur in the mss. 206 It

appears therefore that the mss. either contain a portion only of the 
complete Au£anasa-dharma-sutra or an independent sutra world > 
The former alternative looks more probable. The foregoing 
discussion has shown that the sutra work is later than the dharma- 
sutras of Gautama and Vasistha and also than the Manusmrti, which 
it probably knew in a very ancient version slightly differing from the 
extant one. 

In Jivananda's collection of smnis there is an Ausanasa-dharma- 
&stra in 5 1 verses (part I. pp. 497-501). It deals with mixed 
castes and their avocations, such as suta, magadha, candala, 
svapaca, pulinda &c. The same work occurs in the Anandasrama 
collection, pp. 46-48. The Mit. (on Yaj. 1. 94) remarks that the 
means of livelihood for the mixed castes should be sought for in the 
works of Usanas and Manu. 207 It is probably this smrti that is 
meant. Kulluka on Manu X. 49 says that the sale of hides and 
working on hides were the means of livelihood for Dhigvanas 
according to the Ausanasa. 

In the same collection ( part. I. pp. 301-554) there is another 
smrti ascribed to Usanas in 9 chapters and about 600 verses. It 
treats of Upanayana, daily observances like dcamana, Vedic study, 
occasions of anadhyaya> the dharmas of sndtaka ; sraddha, proper 
Brahmanas for sraddha, impurity on birth and death, rites after 
death, prayascittas for the mortal sins and lesser sins. 

This smrti quotes Usanas himself, also Manu, Bhrgu ( Bhrgu- 
putra III), Prajapati and speaks of dharmasastras, Puranas, Mimariisa, 
Vedanta, Pancaratras, Kapalikas and Pasupatas. Numerous verses 
from the Manusmrti are found in it (e. g. Manu II. 42, 49, 50, 125 ) 
occur in the first chapter alone. There is a brief prose passage 
towards the end of the 9th chapter. It speaks of Kapalikas, 
Pasupatas and atheists together (p. 525 ). 

None of these smrtis in verse contains the passages in verse on 
vyavahara ascribed to Usanas that occur in the Mitaksara, Smrti- 
candrika and other works. 

The Mit. (on Yaj. III. 260 ) and Apararka (e. g. p. 158, 192, 
255 ) contain prose passages ascribed to Usanas and the same works 
contain numerous verses ascribed to Usanas most of which are not 



tl A History qf DhamaiBstra 

foiind in the two smrtis in Jivananda. Some of the verses in 
. Apararka ascribed to Usanas are found in the Ausanasasrnrti ( e. g, 
Apararka p. 418 'kuryad-aharah sraddham' is Jivananda I. p. 521 ). 

In other cases the verses quoted from Usanas in Apararka, 
though not quite identical, bear a very close resemblance ( e. g. the 
four verses in Apararka p. 450 closely resemble Jivananda I. p. 525 
and have some verses in common ). 

Among the views on Vyavahara quoted from Usanas are some 
interesting ones. It was he who said that a son was not bound to 
pay his father's debt, if it was a fine or unpaid toll or what is not 
vyavaharika. 208 He holds that even blind, deaf or old men, women, 
minors could be witnesses in charges ofsahasa ( Apararka p. 671 ). 
He is quoted also on ordeals, on svamipalavivada and on steya. 

A work styled Sukranitisara was edited by Oppert (Madras 1882) 
and by Jivananda (Cal. 1892) and translated by Benoy Kumar 
Sarkar in S. B. H. Series. That work is a very interesting one, but 
is comparatively of a late date. 

18. Kanva and Kanva 

From the Ap. Dh. S. it appears that Kanva and Kanva were two 
distinct writers on dharma. In I. 6. 19. 2 Apastamba starts the 
question as to the persons, food at whose house was permitted. He 
states various views on that point and says that Kanva was of 
opinion that food may be taken at anybody's house provided the 
latter offered it with a request ( I. 6. 19.3 ) and that the opinion of 
Eka, Kunika, Kanva, Kutsaand Puskarasadi (I. 6. 19. 7 ) was that 
only that food that was offered by a pure and religious man should 
be partaken. In another place (I. 10. 28. 1) Apastamba gives it as the 
opinion of Kautsa, Harita, Kanva and Puskarasadi that a man 
became a thief if in any case whatever he appropriates another's 
belongings. The Kumbhakonam edition of Pandit Halasyanatha 
reads Kanva for Kanva. 

Kanva is quoted a few times in the Smrticandrika on Ahnika 
(daily duties) and ^raddha. One of these quotations is in prose 
(I'P- 97 )- 209 Haradatta in his commentary on Gautama cites 

fact!. »d srq^ on ^ 11.47. 



t9. Rama and KOvm lit 

verses of Kariva in several places (e. g. Gautama Dh; S. li. 3, 23. j 
and 11 ).* to The first verse bears a close resemblance to Manu XI. 
180 and Baud. Dh. S. II. i. 62. Kariva is quoted in the Acir- 
mayttkha and the §r&ddha-maytikha. 

The Mit. (onYaj. III. 58) quotes a verse of Ka^va on the 
length of the stay of a sarhnyasin in a village or town. On Yaj. III. 
260 the Mit. quotes a verse of Ka^va stating the praya&itta for a 
Brahmaija having intercourse with the K;atriya wife of his teacher. 

In the Madras Govt. Oriental Library there is a ms. of Kanva 
( vol. V, p. 1929 No. 2624 ). 

19 Kasyapa and Kasyapa. 

Baudhayana ( Dh. S. I. n. 20 ) cites a verse which contains the 
view of Kasyapa that a woman who is bought cannot be zpatni and 
that she is not authorised to take part in religious ( daiva ) rites or 
rites for the Manes. 211 This verse is ascribed to Katyayana in the 
Smrticandrika (I. p. 87 ). The Vanaparva quotes g&th&s of K&yapa 
on forbearrance ( 29. 3S-40 ). Whether Kafyapa and Kasyapa are 
two different writers of dharmasutras it is rather difficult to say. 
Probably they are identical. It appears that the dharmasutra of 
Kasyapa comprised all the usual topics of dharmasutras, such as daily 
duties, sraddha, asauca, prayateitta. This sfttra has been quoted 
by all eminent writers from ViSvariipa downwards. ViSvarGpa 
quotes Kasyapa ( in prose ) on the praya&itta for contact with 
candalas 2 " and for killing a cow when the sinner is a Brahmana or 
a member of another caste.* 1 * The Mit. ( on Yaj. III. 23 ) quotes 
a prose passage from Kasyapa on freedom from impurity on death.*'*

jThe quotations in the Smjticandrika on ahnika and Sraddha are all 
In verse, Haradatta on Gautama (22. 18 ) quotes a sQtra on the 
pr&yakitta for gwadhaf 1 * which is also quoted by Vtevarflpa. 
Haradatta (on Gaut. 23. 26) quotes a very long stitra on the 
pr&ya£citta for eating several things and doing several forbidden acts. 916 
Haradatta ( on Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 2 ) quotes several verses 
mentioning the seven kinds of punarbhus. The Haralata quotes a 
siltra from Kasyapa on asauca. Apararka quotes several sutras and a 
few verses under both names Kasyapa and Kasyapa ( vide Yaj. I. 64, 
III. 265, 1. 222-25, III. 231, 288, 290, 292 for verses), 

in the Deccan College collection there are two mss. ( No. 200 of 
1884-87 and No. 122 of A. 1881-82) which contain a Kasyapa- 
smjti in prose ( 4 folios having 8 lines on each side ). It begins 
c athatab Kasyapiyan grhasthadharman vyakhyasyamab'. It deals 
with the duties of householders, with prayascittas for doing mischief 
to wells, dikes, ponds, temples and houses of Brahmanas, for killing 
a cow and other beasts and birds, with rules on mourning after death 
and impurity on birth, with prayascittas for eating garlic and other 
similar things, with the five mortal sins, with prayascittas when 
such portents as earthquakes, lightning flashes occur, or for such 
accidental occurrences as the breaking of the milk pot, with purifi- 
cation of vessels of wood, metals, with the visible physical sins of 
sins committed in previous lives, with the seven punarbhus. 

In this work some of the sutras quoted as Kasyapa's in the 
commentaries are found, ( e. g. the quotation No. 216 c lasuna' &c. 
above ). So also the verses about punarbhus of seven kinds quoted 
by Haradatta are found in the mss. In this smrti, Kasyapa is 
frequently cited as an authority. 

It is to be noted that Kasyapa is not mentioned by Yaj. as one of 
the dharmasastraprayojakas, though Parasara ( chap. I ) mentions 
Kasyapa dharmah. The Smrticandrika ( I. p. 1 ) and the Sarasvati- 
vilasa (p. 13) speak of 18 Upasmrtis in which KaSyapa's is included. 



tO. Gdrgua 11$ 

20. Gargya 

Visvarupa ( on Yaj. I. 4-5 ) quotes a verse of Vrddha-Yajnavalkya 
in which Gargya is enumerated among the expounders of Dharma 
(dharmavaktaralj). He quotes two sutras, one from Gargya (on 
Yaj. I. 72"? ) and the other from Vrddha-Gargya" 8 (on Yaj. I. 19s). 
Therefore it seems that a sutra work of Gargya on dharma did exist. 
The Mit. ( e. g. on Yaj. III. 326 ), Apararka and the Smrticandrika 
quote several verses of Gargya on ahnika, iraddha and praya&ritta. 
Parasara also mentions Gargya among writers on dharma. Apararka 
contains (pp. 124, 190, 368, 544 ) verses from Gargya on topics of 
dharma. It seems that the two writers are identical. Apararka 
also quotes several verses from Gargya of astronomical import ( e. g. 
p. 547 on the nomenclature of the months as Caitra in connection 
with the signs of the zodiac ). This was probably an independent 
work. Fragments of a Gargi saihhita on astronomy and astrology 
have been recovered and it contains valuable historical information 
( vide Kern's preface to Brhat-samhita pp. 33-40 and Mr. Jayasval 
in JBORS. vol. 14, p. 397 ff ). A Jyotir-Gargya and a Brhad-Gargya 
are quoted in the Smrticandrika. The Nityacarapradipa ( p. 20, 
BIS ) mentions Garga and Gargya separately as smrtikaras. 

21. Cyavana 

The Mit., Apararka and other works cite several sfltras and 
some verses from Cyavana. Apararka quotes a very long 
prose passage from Cyavana ( on Yaj. I. 207 ) about the procedure 
of making the gift of a cow and about the mantras to be recited in 
that ceremony. The Mit. ( on Yaj. HI. 30 ) and Apararka both cite 
a sutra of Cyavana on the prayascitta for coming in contact with a 
dog, a svapaka, a corpse, smoke from a funeral pyre, wine, wine- 
vessel &c. Apararka cites prose passages of Cyavana on the 
prayascitta for killing a cow ( on Yaj. III. 264-26$ ), for touching, 
carrying or burning the corpse of one who commits suicide (on Yaj. 
HI. 292 ), on the method of the purification of houses, vessels, 
articles of food when touched by cagdalas ( on the same verse ). 

22. Jatukarnya 

VisvarGpa on (Yaj. 1. 4-5) quotes a verse of Vrddha-Yajna- 
valky a in which Jatukarpa is mentioned as an expounder of 

* 18 S^Ffiift qngftcK *jf*tai3 1 



1*6 Bidory cf DhahnaOUbta 

dharma.* 1 ' The name is variously written as Jatukarpi or 

Jitdkarpya or as Jatukama. The Smrticandrika quotes a passage 

from Aftgiras in which Jatukarpya is enumerated among writers of 

Upasmrtis. Visvarflpa quotes prose passages from Jatukamya a 

number of times." On Yaj. I. i, he gives a sutra about 

" pratilomas " ; on Yaj. I. 2 there is a sutra sying that a pupil 

should not all of a sudden put a question to his teacher in an 

assembly of people, on Yaj. I. 29 about a Ksatriya and Vateya 

wearing an Upavita of hemp and wool when initiated for sacrifice, 

on Yaj. I. 37 as to the age when a Brahmana became a vratya, about 

the prohibition of marrying another wife of a different caste when 

one has already married a savanna wife ( on Yaj. I. 79 ), about the 

time for sraddhas ( on Yaj. I. 215). These quotations show that 

Jatukaroya composed a sQtra work on acara and Sraddha, which was 

comparatively ancient. The quotations of Jatukanjya in Mitaksara 

Haradatta, Apararka, and later writers are in verse and so it appears 

that by that time the work had been lost or forgotten. Apararka 

( p. 423 ) quotes a verse of Jatukarnya which refers to the zodiacal 

sign Virgo. This would place the verse Jatukaroya not very much 

earlier than the 3rd or 4th century A. D. 

23. Devala 

In the Mit. there are several prose passages quoted from Devala, 
e. g. on Yaj. I. 120 there is a sutra on the dharmas of the sudra and 
the avocations open to him;"' on Yaj. I. 128 there is a sutra 
dividing householders into Yayavara and Salina and describing each 
of them.'" In Apararka and the Smrticandrika there are several

i8. Devala Mi 

ptose quotations from Devala. On Yaj. III. 58 Apararka quotes a 
long prose passage on the rules of conduct for a yati ; on Yaj. III. 
109 Apararka cites a very long passage, in which Saftkhya and 
Yoga are defined, reference is made to extensive Tantras on the 
two systems and a brief resume is given of the Saflkhya system, 
which greatly resembles the Tattvasamasa. On Yaj. III. 227 Apararka 
has a prose quotation from Devala about patitas. In the Smrti- 
candrika (I. p. 63 ) there is a lengthy passage from Devala on the 
daily duties of the brahmacarin, a sUtra (I. p. 52) is quoted about 
brahmacarya for 48 years and in another place there is a prose 
passage about the wife's duties."* 

In the Mit., in Haradatta, Apararka and the Smnicandrika there 
are numerous quotations in verse from Devala on acara, vyavahara, 
fraddha, prayascitta and other topics. That seems to have been an 
independent work. In the Anandasrama collection of smftis there is a 
Devalasmjrti in 90 verses dealing with purification and prayacittas 
for contact with Mleiicchas. This appears to be a late 
compilation. Some of the verses contained therein are ascribed to 
other authors, e. g. verses 17-22 are ascribed to Apastamba by 
Apararka (on Yaj. HI. p. 1200) and verses 30-31 are ascribed by 
the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 290 ) and Apararka to Vi§iju. 

The Mahabharata ascribes the view to Devala that in man there 
are three jyotis, viz. offspring, karma, and learning."* 

Apararka and the Smrticandrika cite verses from Devala OH 
partition, inheritance, on woman's power over stridhana. These 
show that Devala, the jurist, flourished about the same time as the 
great jurists Brhaspati and Katyayana. 

&4« Paithinasi 

• 

Though not enumerated in Yajnavalkya, Paithinasi seems to have 
been a comparatively ancient satrakara on dharma. On Yaj. III. 26a 
ViSvarflpa quotes a sUtra of Paithinasi on the prayafcitta for killing 
a cow. Dr. Jolly ( R.undS.p. 12) following Dr. Caland( Ahnencult 
&c. pp. 99, 109) thinks that Paithinasi belongs to the Atharva* 
veda as the prose quotations on Sraddha agree with the ritual of 



122 History tf Dhdrmafatrd 

the Atharvans. The Mit. (on Yaj. I. 53) quotes a sfctra of Paitfifr 
*iasi to the effect that a person should marry a girl who is beyond 
the third degree on the mother's side and beyond the fifth on the 
father's side."> On Yaj.III. 17 the Mit. quotes two stitras relating to 
impurity on death." 6 The Smjticandrika, Apararka, Haradatta and 
other writers quote numerous sutras of Paifhinasi. The Smrti- 
candrika has a prose quotation on the duties of woQien."? In another 
place the Smrticandrika ( II. p. 263 ) cites a sutra on partition." 8 
Apararka (p. 1 12) quotes two verses of Paitfiinasi recommending the 
practice of sail to women of all castes except Brahmana women. 
Apararka (p. 239) quotes a sutra saying that the food of astrologers, 
bell-makers and gramakutas is poison."* Apararka quotes (on p. 744) 
a sutra of Sarikha-Likhita and Paithinasi about inheritance to a 
deceased sonless man.* 30 Apararka quotes another important prose 
passage 231 "the wealth of (a heirless ) irotriya goes to the pari$ad 
and not to the king, the king should not appropriate the wealth of 
temples and guilds, deposits and the wealth of minors and women." 
Then the sutra quotes a verse on the same topic, which seems to 
refer to Manu 9. ,194m the word 'of sixfold origin' (sadagama). 
Another sutra quoted by Apararka (p. 754) says 'when an appoint- 
ed daughter dies, her husband does not take her wealth ; if she be 
issueless, her mother or mother-in-law should receive it.' Apararka 
quotes a verse of Paiihlnasi (p. 921 ) c at the time of marriage, 
famines, sacrifices, fairs and pilgrimages there is no impurity due 
to birth or death/

25. Budha 

This sfttrakara is not mentioned by Yaj, nor by Parakra, He is 
Very rarely cited, Apararka on Yaj. i. 4-5, Kalpataru (quoted in 
Vlra-mitrodaya, Paribhasa p. 16 ), Hemadri, 232 Jimuta-vahana's 
Kalaviveka are probably the earliest writers to mention him. In the 
Deccan College Collection there are two mss. of a Budha-dharma- 
sastra in prose ( No. 507 of 1881-82 and No. 145 of 1895-1902, 
2 folios). The work is very brief 2 3 3 and speaks of upanayana % 
marriage, eight forms of marriage, the sarhskaras from garbha4hana 
to Upanayana, the five daily great yajnas, sraddha, pakayajnas, 
haviryajnas, somayaga, the means of subsistence for a Brahmana, the 
duties of Vaigyas and Sudras, the orders of forest hermits and 
sannyOsins, removal of thorns by the king, administration of justice, 
king's duties. 

The work does not produce the impression of being early. It is 
in the nature of a summary of larger works on dharma. All quota- 
tions in Hemadri cited from Budha are not found in the mss. 

26. Brhaspati 

That Brhaspati was an ancient teacher of Arthasastra follows from 
the Kautillya, wherein the Barhaspatyas are cited six times. In the 
Mahabharata (Santi, chap. 59. 80-85) Brhaspati is said to have com- 
pressed into 3000 chapters the work on dharma, artha 
and kama composed by Brahma. The Vanaparva (32. 61 ) 
speaks of Bj-haspati-niti. The Mahabharata . several times 
cites verses ( gdtbds or ilokas ) said to have been sung 
by Brhaspati a 34 ( videSanti. 23. 25, 56. 38-39, 57. 6-7 ). Vide

of the Artha&stra composed by Brhaspati and others. In some of 
these places there are distinct references to a sastra or mata of Brhaspati 
and sections of his work are referred to (as e.g. rajadhikara). The Santi* 
parva (170. 12) describes how a king could, according to Bjrhaspatfs 
views, secure his goal in four ways.*** In the Vanaparva (150.29) 
men are said to be upheld by the nayas proclaimed by Brhaspati and 
tJSanas. Vide also Sabha 50. 9, 55. 6, 73. 7-8, Udyoga 33. 7 x -7 2 * 
55. 66. The Kamasfltra repeats the tradition that Brahma com- 
posed a work in one hundred thousand chapters on dharma, 
artha and kama and that Brhaspati dealt with a portion 
of that work, viz. on artha. 2 * 6 Vide note 196 above. Aivaghoja 
( Buddhacarita I. 46 ) speaks of the raja&stra of Sukta 
and Brhaspati. According to the Artha&stra of Kautflya 
some of the special views of Brfiaspati's school were that there were 
only two vidyas for kings viz. varta and dandanlti and that the 
council of ministers should comprise 16 members. According to 
Kamandakaand the Paiicatantra (II. 41) 'avisvasa* was the sheet- 
anchor of royal policy according to Brhaspati. The YaSastilaka (p. 13) 
says that the nlti of Brhaspati had no place for Godson The com- 
mentary on the Nitivakyamrta gives the first verse of Brhaspati.**? 1 * 
Visvarflpa contains several prose quotations which from their context 
must have been taken from Brhaspati about the qualifications of a sena- 
pati, pratihara, duta, &c. It is somewhat strange that in this quotation 
the mantrin is required to be deeply conversant with the Sastras of 
Manu, Brhaspati and U£anas. For similar prose quotations, vide

ViSvarflpa on Yaj. I. 325, II. 154. That Brhaspati also wrote a 
sfitra work on vyavahara and other topics of dharma follows from 
the quotations contained in ViSvarupa and Haradatta. For example, 
Vi£varflpa cites a prose passage from Brhaspati (on Yaj. II. 38) about 
the duty of the king to restore property stolen from his subjects if 
he could not recover it from the thief, about the rising scale of the 
rates of interest according to the castes, about the debts of a deceased 
man being payable by those who took his wealth, by his wife or by 
his son, about a surety being made to pay when the principal died, 
about the illegitimate son of a £udra getting a share on his father's 
death and about his taking the whole estate with the king's per- 
mission if there were no legitimate issue of the Sudra.** 8 Haradatta 
on Gautama 22. 18 quotes a prose passsage from Brhaspati on the 
prtyascitta for killing a cow. These quotations establish that Brhas- 
pati wrote a sutra work on dharma also ( i. e. at least on vya^hara 
and prayakitta). VisvarQpa also quotes a few verses from Brhaspati 
on vyavahara and prayascitta and in one place at least 
indicates that the verse he attributes to Brhaspati occurred in the 
same work in which a prose passage quoted by him occurred. 1 ** 
From this it follows that the sutra work of Brhaspati on dharma 
contained verses also in Visvarupa's time. Whether the two works 
on artha&stra and dharma were composed by the same Brhaspati 
cannot be determined. It looks probable that they were composed 
by different authors. Yaj. (I. 4-5) mentions Brhaspati among the 
expounders of dharma. He is probably referring to the satra work 
on dharma disclosed by quotations from Visvarapa.

independent work composed between 300 and 500 A. D., which 
will be discussed later on ( vide sec. 37 ). 

In Jivananda's collection ( part I. pp. 644-65 1 ) and in the 
Ananda£rama collection there is a Brhaspatismjti in 80 verses in 
which Brhaspati is represented as instructing Indra about gifts. 
Several mss. in the Deccan College Collection contain this smrti, but 
in an abridged form in 70 and 49 verses (No 130 of 1884-86 and 
No 147 of 1895-1902 ). Vide also I. O. cat. p. 386 No. 1324, 1325- 
1328. Aparirka quotes (p 1225 ) verse 7 of this smrti ( in verse) 
and the Danaratnakara quotes verses 6 and 7 as from Dana-Brhaspati. 

The Barhaspatya Artha&Lstra edited by Dr, F. W. Thomas 
(J*ahOTe, 192 1 ) is a later work and does not deserve more than a 
passing notice. In six chapters it deals with the conduct, duties, 
studies of kings, omens, rules of policy &c. 

27. Bharadvaja and Bharadvaja 

There is a Srauta sutra and a Grhya sutra attributed to 
Bharadvaja. The Ms. of the srauta in the Bombay University 
Library contains nine prasnas and a portion of the 10th and begins 
c dar£apaurnamasau vyakhyasyamah \ It quotes Alekhana and 
Aimarathya frequently. The Grhya has been edited by J. W. 
Salomons. It appears from quotations in ViSvarupa and other 
early commentators that a sutra work on dharma attributed to 
Bharadvaja or Bharadvaja was in existence. The forms Bharadvaja 
and Bharadvaja probably refer to the same work. OnYaj. (I. 15) 
Visvarupa quotes a prose passage from Bharadvaja prohibiting the 
learning of mleccha tongues and calling upon the preceptor to teach his 
pupil pure words, observance of Sarhdhya and the kindling of fire ; a * 9ft 
on Yaj. I. 32 Bharadvaja is quoted as prescribing a penance for even 
thinking of causing harm to beings;**** on Yaj J. 185 a lengthy sfltra of 
Bharadvaja on the purification of certain things is quoted, wherein 
is cited the view of some that boys are purified by a mere bath

when touched by antyajas ; **° on Yaj. I. 236 a prOse passage of 
Bharadvaja forbids in sraddhas the use of certain cereals as food. 341 
Apararka quotes a long prose passage (p. 115 5) from Bharadvaja in 
connection with the priyascitta for cessation of grhya fires for 
various periods.* 

In the Smfticandrika, in Haradatta and in several other works 
verses of Bharadvaja are quoted, which appear to be taken from a 
smjti in verse. 

That Bharadvaja was an ancient writer on arthasastra follows 
from the Kautiliya, wherein the views of Bharadvaja are cited seven 
times and of Kariinka Bharadvaja once. Some of the views of Bha- 
radvaja as described in the Kautiliya are that a king should choose 
his ministers from amongst his fellow-students, that the king should 
consider his line of policy alone in secret, that the princes should 
be punished secretly when they manifest no love for the king their 
father, that the minister should set one prince against another when 
the king is on his death-bed, that when calamities befall the king 
and the minister, the former is the lesser of two evils, that one 
should bow down before the strong. This last view occurs in the 
Mahabharata in the same words. 242 The Santiparva (chap. 140) 
contains a dialogue between Bharadvaja and king Satrunjaya of 
Sauvira in which danda is said to be the most pre-eminent among 
the expedients. The same parva (chap. 58. 3) mentions Bharadvaja 
in a list of writers on rajasastra. The Yasastilaka 2 « (4th Asvasa p. 100, 
Nir^iayasagara ed.) quotes two verses of Bharadvaja from his trea- 
tise on the topic of the six gmjas. This shows that Bharadvaja's 
work on politics was available in the 10th century and contained 
verses (probably intermixed with prose).

The Para&ra-Madhavlya (vol. III. p. 231) quotes a verse of 
BhAradvaja which divides a pledge into four varieties. A few quota- 
tions from Bharadvaja on matters of vyavahara are cited in other 
works. For example, the Sarasvatl-vilasa cites a verse of Bharad- 
vaja that a compromise, an exchange and a partition, if fair and equal, 
could be annulled only for ten days, but could be annulled till the 
9U1 year, if unfair. 2 " It appears that the verses of Bharadvaja on 
vyavahara are taken from a work other than the ancient work on 
politics* 

28. Satatapa 

Satatapa is enumerated among the expounders of dharma by Yaj. 
(I. 4-5 ) and by Parasara. Vis\tirupa, Haradatta and Apararka 
quote several prose passages of Satatapa on prayascitta. ViSvarGpa 
( on Yaj. IJI. 236 ) tells us that Satatapa spoke of only eight 
upapatakas and that without dealing with Sraddha as a principal 
topic he spoke of some of the subsidiary details of sraddha. 24 * The 
latter passage quoted from Satatapa is a half verse. So VtevarGpa 
had a prose work of Satatapa before him, mixed with verses. 
Haradatta on Gaut. ( Dh. S. 22. 18 ) quotes a prose passage of 
Satatapa about the penance for killing a cow. In the 
Mit., the Smrticandrika and other works numerous verses of Satatapa 
are quoted on acara and sraddha. This wotk of Satatapa in verse is 
most probably a different one from the sutra work. It appears that there 
are several smnis ascribed to Satatapa. In Jivananda's collection 
there is a smrti of Satatapa called Karmavipaka in six chapters and 
about 231 verses. Its contents are : certain diseases are concomitants 
of certain sins ; gifts of land, cows &c. ; eulogy of Brahmapas; 
penances for killing a Brahma^a, a cow &c, penances for drinking 
wine, for incest and forbidden sexual intercourse of various sorts, 
for thefts; rites for those who meet with violent ^nd accidental death. 
The last verse declares that the Smrti was promulgated by Satatapa 
to his pupil Sarabhanga. It is a late production. It prescribes the 
reading of the Harivamsa ( II. 30 ) as a penance for infanticide. 



f& tiatatapa 129 

No. 1362 of the I. O. catalogue ( and cat. of Madras Govt. mss. 
vol. V. pp. 1994-96) is a Satatapa-smrti in twelve chapters dealing 
with prayascittas for mahapatakas, prayascittas fot injuries to various 
beings, marriage, vaisvadeva, sraddha, pitrtarpana, rules about 
taking one's dinner, prayascitta for dogbites and similar matters; 
impurity on birth and death, rules of conduct ( acara ). 

No. 1361 of the I.O. catalogue is a treatise in mixed prose and verse 
on prayascittas for the Mahapatakas and Upapatakas. Several verses 
of Manu (such as III. 8, 11, 171 ) occur therein. It contains 139 
verses. In Mitra's Notices (II. p. 4) there is a ms. called Karmavipaka 
in 87 chapters and 2376 verses, of which the work in Jivananda's 
collection seems to be a part or abridgment. 

Apararka in several places quotes the views of Satatapa 
immediately followed by quotations from Vrddha-Satatapa or vice 
versa ( e. g. on Yaj. I. 190, on III. 292 p. 1 195 and p. 1201 ). 

No. 205 of A. 1882-83 of the Deccan College Collection is a 
Vrddha-Satatapa smrti in 64 verses on prayascittas for doing various 
things, on sraddha, on washing the teeth. I. O. Cat. No. 1360 
p. 398 is a Vjrddha-Satatapa-smrti in 97 verses on defilement and 
purifications. The Anandasrama collection contains a Vjrddha- 
Satatapa smrti in 68 verses ( pp. 232-235 ) on prayacittas, purification 
from various defilements and other miscellaneous matters. There 
are two prose passages therein. 

Hemadri mentions a Vrddha-Satatapa along with several other 
smrtikaras ( vide note 232 above). In the Vyavaharamatyka of 
Jimutavahana ( p. 305 ) Vrddha-Satatapa is cited on the six kinds of 
uttara (defendant's reply ). 246 This shows that Vrddha-Satatapa 
wrote on Vyavahara also. 

The Mit. (on Yaj. III. 290 ) cites a Bjrhat-Satatapa. 

Hemadri ( III. 1. 801 ) speaks of a bha§yakara of Vrddha-Satatapa. 

29. Sumantu. 

From Visvarupa, Haradatta and Apararka it follows that Sumantu 
composed a sutra work on dharma, particularly on acara and prayai- 
citta. Viivarupa quotes prose passages from Sumantu on upapatakas/*? 



136 History <tf fiharmaiasto 

on prayascitta for Brahmaria-murder ( on Yaj. III. 237 ), for drink- 
ing wine ( on Yaj. III. 250 ), for theft of gold (on Y&j. Ill 252), for 
incest (on Yaj. HI. 253-54), f° r killing a cow and about atatayin(on 
Yaj. III. 261 ). In one quotation from Sumantu cited by ViSvarflpa 
the views of acaryas and of Afigirasa are mentioned.* 48 The praya£- 
cittas for Brahmana-murder and for killing a cow contained in 
Visvarupa occur in Haradatta ( on Gaut. 22. 13 and 18 ). Most of 
the quotations cited by Visvarupa occur in Apararka also. The 
Haralata ( p. 68 ) quotes sutras of Sumantu on asauca. One well- 
known sutra of Sumantu is c no prayascitta ( or blame ) is incurred 
by killing an atatayin, except cows and brahmanas\ a *9 Apararka 
quotes satras from Sumantu condemning marriage with maternal 
uncle's or paternal aunt's daughter and recommending the jbandon- 
ment of a young wife in certain circumstances.** In the Sarasvatl- 
vilasa a prose passage of Sumantu is cited on the seven constituents 
of rajya.^* 

These quotations from Visvarupa and others establish that a prose 
work on dharma by Sumantu existed early enough. It appears 
however that the work was not a very ancient one. Neither 
Yajiiavalkya nor Parasara mentions Sumantu among the propounders 
of dharma. On the other hand the name of Sumantu is an ancient 
one. In the Bhagavatapuraga ( XII. 6. 75 and 7. 1 ). Sumantu is 
said to have been a pupil of Jaimini and a promulgator of the Atha- 
rvaveda. Vide Santiparva 341. 19 for Sumantu and other pupils of 
Vyasa. In the daily tarpaya the name of Sumantu occurs along 
with Jaimini, Vaisampayana, Paila.

4P« Sumantu iSi 

Numerous verses on dharma are also cited from Sumantu by 
Apararka, the Smrticandrika and other works. This may probably 
be a different work from the sutra work of Sumantu. In one verse 
of Sumantu ( Apararka on Yaj. I. 223 ) occur the words ' Saftkha- 
sya vacanaih yatha ' and in another ( Apararka on Yaj, I. 217-218 ) 
the Kanya sign of the zodiac is referred to. 

It is remarkable that the Mit. and Apararka contain no verses of 
Sumantu on vyavahara. The Sarasvati-vilasa is rich in quotations 
from Sumantu on vyavahara. A compromise, exchange or partition, 
if fair, could be annulled up to the tenth day, but if unfair up to the 
9th year ( vide note 244 above ). ' If even as much as a mdfa 
went from the buyer to the seller, that would support the sale of the 
land (sold) just as a small dose of poison permeates the whole body 
and when no purchase-money is paid or only a portion is paid, 
then the purchase is called avdkraya and is liable to be set aside if 
the price is not paid in ( good time ). ' Sumantu prescribes a fine 
for selling and purchasing land without the consent of the neigh- 
bouring members of the family and says that in case of pre-emption, 
the neighbours on the east are preferred to all and those on the 
south come last. ** 2 Sumantu defines a mortgage by conditional sale 
( called t uktalabhakraya ' ) and a sale for arrears of revenue by the 
king's orders ( called ajfiakraya ). a » 

3o. The Smrtis 

The word smrti is used in two senses. It is applied to all 
ancient orthodox non-Vedic works such as Panini's grammar, to the 
srauta, grhya and dharma sutras, to the Mahabharata, to Manu, 
Yajnavalkya and others. In a narrower sense smrti and dharma-

1S9 History of Dhamaiddra 

&stra are synonyms, as Manu says. 2 ** The word smrti occurs in 
Taittiriya Aranyaka ( I. 2 ). Gautama ( Dh. S. I. 2 ) and Vasistha 
( Dh. S. I. 4 ) speak of smrti as one of the sources of dharma. 
Ap. Dh. S. (II. 6. 15. 25 ) employs the word smrti and has in view 
Gautama's dhariYuisutra according to Haradatta. In the PCirva- 
mimamsa-sutra the word smrti occurs ( vide VI. 8. 23 and XII. 4. 
42 ).**s In the Vedantasutras the word smrti is employed in a wide 
sense, in one place as referring even to the sarikhya system. 2 * 6 In that 
work the word is used according to Sankara with reference to the 
Mahabharata or the Manusmrti ( Vcdantasutra II. 3. 47, III. 1. 14 
and 21, IV. 2. 14). 

In ancient times the number of smrtis (i. e. works on dharma- 
sastra ) must have been very small. Gautama mentions by name 
no smrtikara except Manu, though he speaks of dharmasastras (XI. 
19). Haudhayana names seven (besides himself) authors on 
dharma, viz. Aupajanghani, Katya, Kasyapa, Gautama, Prajapati, 
Maudgalya and Haiita. Vasistha names only five authors, Gautama, 
Prajapati, Manu, Yama, and Harita. Apastamba mentions a large 
number, viz. ten, some of whom like Eka, Kunika and Puskarasadi 
are no more than mere names to us. Manu speaks of only six 
( besides himself) viz. Atri, the son of Utathya, Bhrgu, Vasistha, 
Vaikhanasa ( or rather Vikhanas ) and Saunaka. But in all these 
works the writers arc mentioned only casually and there is no 
regular enumeration or list of writers on dharma in one place. 
Apararka quotes (p. 7 ) a sutra of Gautama (not found in the printed 
G. Dh. S. ) in which sixteen authors of dharmasastras including 
himself are enumerated. 2 " The same sutra with slight variations is 
ascribed to &ankba-Likhita in the Viramitrodaya ( Paribhasa- 
prakasa p. 16). Yajnavalkya is probably the earliest writer who 
enumerated in one place ( T. 4-5 ) twenty expounders of dharma 
( including himself and counting Saflkha and Likhita as two distinct 
persons). It will be noticed that Yaj. omits Baudhayana. 
Paraiara also gives a list of 19 expounders of dharma (excluding

himself), but his list differs slightly frorti that of Yaj. Parasara 6mits 
Prhaspati, Yama, and Vyasa and adds Kasyapa, Gargya and 
JPracetas. The Tantra-vartika ( p. 125 ) of Kumarila speaks of 
eighteen dharmasamhitas. Visvarupa quotes a verse of Vrddha-. 
Yajnavalkya, who adds ten names to the list of Yajfiavalkya ( vide 
note 219 above ), The Caturvimsatimata is a work which professes 
to give the views of 24 sages on dharmasastra, viz. all those listed by 
Y*j. (except Katyayana and Likhita) and six more, viz. Gargya 
Narada, Baudhayana, Vatsa, Visvamitra, Saiikha (Saftkhyayana ? ). 
Aftgiras as quoted in the Smrticandrika ( I. p. 1 ), Hemadri 
(Danakhanda p. 528), the Sarasvativilasa (p. 13) and other 
works mention Upasmrtis. 2 *? There is a smrti called $attrimsan- 
mata quoted by the Mit., Apararka and other works. Paifhinasi as 
quoted in the Smrticandrika, the Sarhskaramayukha and other 
works enumerates 36 smrtis. 260 Apararka says that the Bhavisyat- 
purana speaks of 36 smrtis and his enumeration of them is slightly 
different from that of Paithlnasi. 261 The Vrddhagautamasmrti 
( Jivananda part II. pp. 498-499 ) gives a list of 57 dharma-sastras. 
The Prayoga-parijata as quoted in the Viramitrodaya enumerates 18

principal smjtis, 18 upasmjtis and 21 other smrtikaras.*" If all 
the smrtis cited in the later nibandhas such as the Nirriayasindhu, 
the MayOkhas of Nilakaijtha and the Viramitrodaya be taken into 
account, the number of smrtis will be found to be about 100. 

The smpis thus relied upon are the products of different and 
and widely separated ages. Some of them are entirely in prose or 
in mixed prose and verse, while the large majority are in verse, A few 
of them are very ancient and were composed centuries before the 
Christian era. Such are the dharmasurras of Gautama, Apastamba, 
Baudh&yana, and the Manusmjti. Some were composed in the first 
centuries of the Christian era such as the smrtis of Yajnavalkya, 
Par&£ara, N&rada. Most of the smrtis other than the above fall 
between the period from 400 A. D. to 1000 A. D. The chronology 
of all these smrtis presents perplexing problems. Some of the 
metrical smrtis are remodellings of older siitras as in the case of 
Safikha. There are sometimes as many as two or three different 
smrtis going under the same name, e.g. Satatapa, Harita, Atri. 
Then the confusion is worse confounded by the fabrications of 
sectarian zeal, such as the Haritasmiti which is full of Vaisnavaite 
teachings. There are several works going under the names of well- 
known smrtikaras with the prefixes Vrddha, Brhat, Laghu. In 
many cases the works going under these names are different from 
the smjrtis that are without these prefixes and this differentiation 
took place at a very early date in certain cases, for example, so early 
a writer as Viivarupa distinguishes between Yajnavalkya and 
Vrddha-Yajiiavalkya, Gargya and Vrddha-Gargya. Similarly 
Viivarupa quotes ( on Yaj. I. 69 ) Vrddha-Manu and (on Yaj. I. 19) 
Vrddha-Vasistfia, which latter probably was different from the 
Vasi§thadharmasutra, as the latter does hot contain the details given

fey Viivarfipa.*'* In some cases the works designated Vrddba or 
Brhat are larger and in all cases later than the works without those 
prefixes. For example, Parasara and Brhat-Parasara ( Jivananda 
part II. pp. 55-310), Gautama and Vrddha-Gautama (Jivananda 
part II. pp. 497-638 ). Some of the works with the prefix Vrddha 
are versified compilations of prose works, e. g. Mit. on Yaj. III. 267 
quotes a verse from Vrddha- Visnu which is merely the versified 
equivalent of Visnu-dharmasutra chap. 50. 6, 12-14. ft appears 
that sometimes the same work is cited with the prefix Vrddha or 
Brhat, e. g. the Mit. on Yaj. II. 135 quotes a passage from Brhad- 
vijriu which is the same as the Visnudharmasutra 17. 4-7. 

As most of the writers of digests quote from memory and had 
recourse to mss. and not to standard editions, even well known 
verses are ascribed to different authors in different works. The 
verses 'bhratrpam-aprajab' &c. which are quoted as Narada's ( N&rada 
16.25-26 ) in the Vyavaharamayukha are attributed to Sankha in the 
Madanaparijata (p. 680). The three verses about bandhus are 
ascribed to Baudhayana by Madhava and to Vrddhasitatapa by the 
Madanaparijata ( p. 674 ). 

In spite of all these drawbacks, an attempt will be made in the 
following pages to arrange some of the leading versified smftis in 
chronological order beginning from the Manusmrti. 

All these smrtis are not equal in authority. Most of them are 
obscure and are only rarely cited by ancient commentators. 
Exclusive of the dharmasutras hardly a dozen smrtis have found 
commentators. If we are to judge of the authority of a smrti by 
the commentaries thereon, then the Manusurti stands pre-eminent. 
Next to it is the Yajnavalkyasmrti. 

3i. The Manusmrti 

So many editions of this work have been published in India 
since 181 3 ( when the Manusmrti was first published at Calcutta ), 
that it is not possible to name them. In this work the Nirpaya- 
sAgara edition with the commentary ofKullaka has been used 
throughout. Another edition of Manu well known on this side of 
India is that of the late V. N. Mandlik who published several com- 

the five <f$i on one's Land. 



$W RUtory <tf tfoxrmatiUtra 

itiehtaries snch as those of Medhatithi, Govindaraja and others;. 
The Manusmjrti has been translated into English several times. The 
best known translation is that of Dr. Btihler in the S. B. E. series 
( vol. 25 ). Dr. Biihler also added an exhaustive and very scholar- 
ly introduction to his translation and dealt with numerous problems 
connected with the Manusmrti. 

In the Rgveda Manu is spoken of as the father of mankind 
( Rg. I. 80. 16, L 114. 2, II. 33. 13) and a Vedic poet prays that he 
. may not be led away from the ancestral path of Manu. a6 + Another 
Vedic bafd says that Manu was the first to offer sacrifice ( Rg. 
X. 63. 7). In the Taittiriya Samhita and the Tandya-maha-brah- 
maiia it is said c whatever Manu said is medicine.' 265 Taittiriya-Sarh- 
hita (II. 1.5.6) also says that mankind is Manu's (Manavyo hi pra- 
jab ). In the Taittiriya Samhita ( III. 1.9. 4-5 ) and the Aitareya 
Brahmaoa (V. 14 ) we have the story of Manu dividing his wealth 
among his sons and of the exclusion of his son Nabhanedisfha. 
The Satapatha-brahmana (S. B. E. vol. 12 p. 216) gives us the 
story of Manu and the deluge. In the Nirukta ( chap. Ill ) there 
is a discussion about the rights of sons and daughters. One of the 
views there propounded is that children of both sexes take their 
father's wealth and a fk and sloka are cited in support of that 
position. 266 The sloka refers to the opinion of Manu Svayambhuva. 
It is noteworthy that that sloka is opposed to a rik, which means that 
the Sloka is not Sruti but is Smrti. So before Yaska wrote there 
were smrti texts in verse in which Manu was spoken of as a law- 
giver. We have seen how Gautama and Vasisjha quote the views 
of Manu and how Apastamba connects Manu with the promulgation 
of $raddhas( II. 7. 16. 1 ). The Mahabharata in numerous places 
speaks of Manu, sometimes as Manu simply, sometimes as Svayam- 
bhuva Manu (&anti2i. 12) and also as Pracetasa Manu (Santi 
57. 43 ). In the Mahabharata (Santi. chap. 336. 38-46 ) we are 
told how the supreme being composed a hundred thousand slokas

on dhartna, how Manu Svayambhuva promulgated those dharmas 
and howUsanas and Brhaspati composed iastras based on the work 
of Manu Svayambhuva. 2fi ? In another place the account is slightly 
different and Manu does not figure therein. Santi-parva ( chap. 59. 
80-85 ) describes how the original work of Brahma on the three, 
Dharma, Ariha, and Kama> in 1 00000 chapters was successively re- 
duced to 1 0000, 5000, 3000 and 1000 chap, respectively by Vi&laksa, 
Indra, Bahudantaka, Brhaspati and Kavya ( Usanas ). The prose 
introduction to the Narada-smrti says that Manu composed in 
1000; *) slokas, 1080 chap, and 24 prakaratias a Dharmasastra and 
imparted it to Narada, who abridged it into 12000 verses and taught • 
it to Markarideya, who in his turn compressed it into 8000 Slokas 
and passed it on to Sumati Bhargava, who again reduced it to 4000 
slokas. The Narada-smrti then gives the first verse 268 of that work 
which is a combination of the extant Manu I. 5-6 and says that 
vyavahara was the 9th prakarana out of 24 in the original work of 
Manu. It will be noticed how this version differs from that ot the 
Mahabharata wherein Narada is altogether ignored. The extant 
Manusmrti ( I. 32-33 ) narrates how from Brahma sprang Viraj, 
who produced Manu, from whom were born the sages including 
Bhrgu and Narada, how Brahma taught the sastra to Manu, who in 
his turn imparted it to the ten sages ( I. 58 ), how some great sages 
approached Manu and sought instruction in the dharmas of the 
varyas and the intermediate castes and how Manu told them that 
his pupil Bhrgu would impart to them the sa$tra ( I. 59-60 ). This 
appearance is kept up throughout the work. The sages interrupt 
Bhjrgu's discourse in several places ( as in V. 1-2 and XII. 1-2 )• 
Manu is said to be omniscient ( II. 7 ) and Manu is mentioned by 
name dozens of times in the work with the words " Mamiiaha" 
( IX. 158, X. 78 etc ), or "Manur-abravid" or "Manor-anu&sanam".

(VIII. 139, 279, IX. 239, etc). That the introductory words in 
the Narada-smyti are not spurious or a later addition follows from 
the remark of Medhatithi that, according to the Naradasmrti, Prajapati 
composed a work in 1 00000 Slokas which was abridged by Manu 
and others. a6 9 No one should take very seriously these varying 
accounts even in the Mahabharata and in the Naradasmyti, as they are 
intended to glorify some particular text or texts. According to the 
Bhavisya-purana as quoted in Hemadri, the Samskara-maydkha and 
other works, there were four versions of the Svayambhuva &stra 
composed by Bhrgu, Narada, Brhaspati and Afigiras. 2 ? So early a 
writer as Visvarupa cites verses from Manusmrti as those of Svayam- 
bhu ( vide com. on Yaj. II. 73, 74, 83, 85, where Manu 8. 68, 
70-71, 380 and 105-6 are respectively quoted as Svayambhu's), while 
quotations from Bhrgu cited by Visvarupa (on Yaj. I. 187 and 252 ) 
are not found in the Manusmrti. In the same way most of the 
verses quoted from Bhrgu by Apararka are not found in the Manu- 
smrti. One verse which Apararka quotes from Bhrgu (on Yaj . II. 96) 
speaks of the view contained therein as that of Manu. 2 ? 1 

It is almost impossible to say who composed the Manusmrti. 
It goes without saying that the mythical Manu, progenitor of 
mankind even in the Rgveda, could not have composed it. What 
motives could have induced the unknown author to palm it off in 
the name of the mythical Manu and to suppress his identity it is 
difficult to say. One motive may have been to invest the work 
with a halo of antiquity and authoritativeness. Buhler following 
Max Mailer says ( SEE vol. 25 p. XVIII ) that the Manusmrti 
is based on or is a recast of an ancient dharmasutra, viz. that of the 
Manavacarana. The question whether the Manavadharmasatra 
existed has been discussed above (sec. 13, pp. 79-85). Btthler himself 
candidly admits ( SBE vol. 25, p. XXIII ) that the recovery of the 
writings of the Manavas has not only not furnished any facts in support 
of the alleged relation between the Manavadharmasiitra and the 

fft I fcwSfa on jg I. 58. 



SI. Th*Ma*usmrti ISO 

Manusmrti, but on the contrary has raised difficulties as the 
doctrines of the Manavagrhyasutra (edited by Dr. Knauer) differ 
very considerably from those of the Manusmrti. To take only a 
few examples, Manava Gr. S. II. 12. 1-2 are opposed to Manu 3.1; 
Manava Gr. S. 1. 4. 7 to Manu 4. 95 ; Manava Gr- S. I. 20. 1 to 
Manu 2. 34 ; Manava Gr. S. I. 21. 1 to Manu 2. 33 ; Manava Gr. S. 
1. 22. 1 to Manu 2. 36 ; Manava Gr. S. II. 12. 1-2 to Manu 3. 84-86. 
Besides there is nothing in our Manu corresponding to the 
Vinayaka&nti in the Manavagrhya ( II. 14 ) nor to the tests for 
selecting a bride prescribed in Manava Gr. S. I. 7. 9, which 
corresponds to A^vaUyana Gr. S. I. 5. 5-6. Dr. Caland points out 
( R. und S. p. 17 ) that though single verses of the Manusmrti tally 
with the Sraddhakalpa of the Manava School, yet the descriptions of 
funeral rites widely differ in the two works. There are no doubt some 
parallels as pointed out by Bradke ( in ZDMG, vol. 36, pp. 417-477). 
There is one circumstance about the authorship of the Manusmrti that 
deserves to be noted. The Mahabharata seems to distinguish between 
Svayambhuva Manu and Pracetasa Manu. The former is said to be 
the promulgator of dharmasastra and the latter of arthasastra ( or 
politics). For example Santi 21. 12 speaks of Svaymbhuva Manu 
and Santi 57-43 and 58-2 speak of Pracetasa as an author on 
rajaidstra or rajadharma. In some places Manu alone without any 
epithet is associated with rajadharma or arthavidyA. It is not 
unlikely that originally there were two distinct works, one on 
dharma and the other on arthasastra attributed to Manu. When the 
Kautiliya speaks of the Manavas, he probably refers to the work on 
politics attributed to Pracetasa Manu. It is extremely doubtful 
whether RajaSekhara, when he mentions the several views on the 
number of vidyas ( including that of the Manavas that they were 
three ), had the Arthasastra of the Manavas before him or only 
copied a passage from Kautflya ( vide Kavyamimamsa p. 4 )♦ 
It is not unlikely that the work on dharma attributed 
to Manu may have contained general directions on the 
duties of kings. It is therefore ( i. e. because there were 
two different works on dharma and arthasastra attributed to 
Manu ) that the views ascribed to the Manavas by the Kautiliya are 
not found word for word in the extant Manusmrti. One may 






140 History of Dharmaindra 

hazard the conjecture that the author of the Manusmrti, whoever 
he might have been, combined in his work the information contain- 
ed in the two works on dharma and arthaidstra and supplanted both 
the earlier works and that this result had not been either accompli- 
shed at the time when the Kautiliya was composed or was then quite 
recent. In the extant Manusmrti, the work is ascribed to Svayaih- 
bhuva Manu and then six other Manus of whom Pracetasa is not 
one are enumerated ( I. 62 ). 

The extant Manusmrti is divided into twelve adhydyas and con- 
tains 2694 slokas. Dr. Jolly's edition ( published in 1895 ) prepar- 
ed after collating numerous mss. and printed editions contains only 
one sloka more. The Manusmrti is written in a simple and flowing 
style. It generally agrees with Panini's system, though it con- 
tains some deviations from it as in the verse * saksinafc santi mety- 
uktva ' ( 8. 57 ). The foregoing pages have sufficiently shown how 
it agrees closely with the doctrines contained in the DharmasOtras 
of Gautama, Baudhayana, Apastamba. We have also seen how 
numerous verses are common to the dharmasutras of Vasisfha and 
Visnu and the Manusmrti. The Kautiliya also exhibits remarkable 
agreement with the Manusmrti in phraseology and doctrines. 2 ?* 
What conclusions are to be drawn from this will be discussed later 
on. Some verses are repeated, e. g. V. 164-165 are the same as 
IX. 30 and 29. The contents of the Manusmrti may be briefly 
summarised as follows :-■-( I ) Sages approach Manu for instruction 
in the dharmas of the varnas ; Manu describes the creation of the 
world from the self-existent God more or less in the Sankhya manner ; 
the creation of Viraj, of Manu from Viraj, of ten sages from Manu ; 
creation of various beings, men, beasts, birds etc. ; Brahma imparts 
dharmasastra to Manu, who teaches the sages ; Manu bids Bhrgu to 
instruct the sages in dharma ; six other Manus sprang from Svayam- 
bhuva Manu; units of time from nimesa to year, the four yugas and

The extent of the literature known to Manu was considerable. 
He mentions the three Vedas and the Atharvaveda is spoken of as 
the Atharvarigirasi Sruti (XI. 33). He refers to Aranyaka (IV. 
123). The Vedangas are said to be six (III. 185) and they are 
often referred to without stating the number (II. 141, IV. 98 ). He 
speaks of dharmasastra (II. 10 ) and also knew many dharmasastras 
( III. 232 ). By dharmapathaka ( XII. 1 1 1 ) he probably means one 
who has studied dharmasastras. He mentions several authors on 
dharmasastra, viz. Atri, the son of Utathya ( i. e. Gautama 
according to commentators ), Bhrgu and Saunaka ( all these in III. 
16 ), Vasistha ( on the rate of interest in VIII. 140 which agrees 
with Vasisfhadharmasutra II. 50), Vaikhanasamata (in VI. 21). 
He mentions Akhyanas, Itihasas, Puranas and Khilas (III. 232). 
He speaks of brahma as described in the Vedanta ( in VI. 83 and 94 ) 
and is probably thinking of the Upanisads. That he knew some 
generally accepted works opposed to the teaching of the Vedas is 
quite clear from his reference to 'Vedabahyah smrtayah* ( XII. 95 ). 
He is probably referring to the writing of the Bauddhas, Jainas and 
others. He speaks of heretics and their guilds (IV. 30 and 61). 
He refers to atheism and calumny of the Vedas ( IV. 163 ) and of 
various tongues spoken among men (IV. 332). He frequently 
refers to the views of others in the words "keck", "apare", "anye" 
(as in III. 261, X. 70, IX. 32). 

Numerous interesting and difficult problems are connected with 
the Manusmrti. Biihler in his elaborate introduction ( S B E vol. 
25 ) exhaustively deals with these problems. It is not possible to go 
at great length into those questions here. A separate volume would 
be required to deal with the problems raised by Biihler and to 
examine the arguments of Btthler, Hopkins and others who have 
written on them. Only a brief discussion of some of these problems 
can be attempted. 



1m Biitcry €f DnottmUnln 

Btihler takes considerable pains to refute the claims ot Manu to 
be regarded as the first legislator ( S. B. E. vol. 25 pp. XXIII-XXX )• 
But no serious refutation of the claim is really needed. The very 
extent of the literature known to the Manusmrti and the mention 
of several writers on dharmasastra by name are sufficient to negative 
that claim. 

Btihler devotes a great deal of space to the consideration of the 
question as to what circumstances led to the substitution of a 
universally binding Manava-dharmasastra for the manuals of the 
Vedic schools (S. B. E. vol. 25 pp. XLVI-LVI ) and as to why the 
special law schools selected just the Manavadharmastitra among the 
large number of similar works for the basis of their studies ( ibid, 
pp. LVII-LXV). Btihler then considers the question how the 
Manavadharmastitra was converted into the present Manusmrti. 
Btihler concedes that the last is a problem of great difficulty and 
admits of an approximate solution only. The discussion of all 
these questions by Biihler is extremely thought-provoking and 
brilliant in many places, though it must be said with great respect 
that the arguments are often a priori and savour more or less of 
special pleading. As I question the very foundation of Btihler's 
edifice (viz. the actual existence of a Manava-dharmasutra ), it 
would be futile for me to enter into a discussion of the problems 
referred to above. 

I shall now address myself to the discussion of the age of the 
Manusmrti from external and internal evidence. That question is 
bound up with other problems, viz. whether there are earlier and 
later strata in the extant Manusmrti, whether the Manusmrti was 
recast several times or once only, what relations exists between the . 
Manusmrti and the Mahabharata. 

First the external evidence may be taken up. The bhasya of 
Medhatithi is the earliest extant commentary on the Manusmrti 
and was composed about 900 A. D. as will \>c shown later on (sec. 3 6). 
The text commented upon by Medhatithi was the same ( barring a 
few various readings) as the one we now possess. Therefore long 
before 900 A. D. the Manusmrti was the same as now. Vtevartipa 
in his commentary on Yaj. quotes over two hundred verses of the 
Manusmrti either wholly or in part from all the twelve chapters 
beginning with the very first verse. The text that Visvartipa had 
before him was the same as the present Manusmrti and the verses 



&1. The Manusmrti 145 

were arranged in the same order as at present. Visvarupa quotes 
eight verses ( Manu XI. 108-115 ) from Manu ( on Yaj. III. 262 ). 
Saftkaracarya in his Vedantsutra-bhasya quotes the Manusmrti 
very frequently. For example, he quotes Manu I. 5 and 21 ( on 
V. S. I. 3- 28 ), I. 27 ( on V. S. IV. 2. 6 ), II. 87 ( on V. S. HI. 
4. 38 ), X. 4 and 126 ( on V. S. I. 3. 36 ), XII. 91 and 105-6 ( on 
V. S. II. 1 and n ). In his bhasya on the Br. U. he quotes Manu 
dozens of times and calls the Manuiinrti 2 ^ 'Manavam' ( on Br. U. 
1. 4. 17 ). He looks upon the Manusmrti as one of the 
authorities on which the author of the. Vediintasutra relies. 2 ? s 
The Tantravartika of Kumarila stands in a special relation to the 
Manusmrti. Vide JBBRAS for 1925 pp. 98-100. He places 
Manu at the head of all smrtis, even higher than the dharma- 
sutra oi Gautama. He cites numerous quotations from the first 
chapter of the Manusmrti to the last. He looks upon all parts of 
the extMit Manusmrti as equally authoritative and regards the Manu- 
smrti as the highest authority on matters of dharma. The Mrccha- 
katika 2 ? 6 (9. 39 ) refers to the ordinance of Manu that a Brahmana 
sinner was not to be sentenced to death, but was to be banished. 
An inscription of the Valabhi king Dharasena dated in the year 252 
of the Valabhi era ( i. e. 571 A. D. ) speaks of a king as one who 
obeyed the rules composed by Manu 2 ?7 ( I. A. vol. 8. p. 303 = Gupta 
Inscriptions p. 165 ). Videzteol. A. vol. IV. p. 105 where the 
same words occur in an inscription from Valabhi dated 216 of the 
Valabhi era ( i. e. 535 A. D. ). Sabarasvamin, the bha?yakara of 
Jaimini's sutras, who cannot be placed later than 500 A. D. and may 
be a few centuries earlier still, says " Manu and others have given

instruction'? 8 " and quotes a verse as a smrti passage which is prac- 
tically the same as Manu IX. 416 and similar to Udyoga-parva*™ 
33. 64. Apararka and Kulluka point out how the Bhavi§yapurana 
expounds passages of the Manusmrti ( vide Kulluka on Manu XI. 
72,73, 100 and Apararka pp. 107 1, 1076 ). a8 ° It will be shown 
below that Brhaspati must have composed his work before 500 A. D. 
Brhaspati says that the Manusmrti occupies a pre-eminent position 
because it correctly represents the sense of the Veda and that 
a smrti which is in conflict with Manu is not esteemed.* 81 Brhaspati 
in numerous places pointedly refers to the present text of the Manu- 
smrti* One such quotation about niyoga has been cited above 
( note 172 ). Brhaspati says " Manu has spoken of quantities 
( units of weights ) beginning from the mote in the sun-beam to the 
karsapana. 382 " This is obviously a reference to Manu 8. 132-136. 
Brhaspati says " Manu enumerated thirteen sons and just as in the 
absence of clarified butter, oil is a substitute, so in the absence of an 
aurasa son or a putrika, the eleven kinds of son are a substitute.* 83 " 
This has in view Manu 9. 158-160, 180, 127-130, whe™ Manu 
speaks of the twelve sons, out of whom eleven are substitutes and

advocates that a sonless man should appoint a daughter (putrika, 
who then is the 13th kind of son ). In another place Brhaspati 
declares " Manu forbade gambling as it destroys truth, purity and 
wealth ; but others allowed it provided a share was given to the 
king ( in the gains of gambling 28 * ). ,% This very aptly describes the 
attitude of Manu ( 9. 224 ) and of Yaj. ( II. 201-203 ). Brhaspati 
says u If a man kills a cow with a weapon &c, he should perform 
the penance laid down by Manu, but if he kills a cow by forcible 
restraint, then he should perform the penance laid down by Afigiras 
or Apastamba. ° The reference is to Manu XL 108-115, Apastamba 
Dh. S. I. 9. 26. 1 and Aftgirasa verse 27 ( Jivananda, part I p. 556 ). 
In one place Brhaspati seems to criticise Manu ( 9. 219 ) when he 
says " those who declared clothes and other things to be impartible 
have not considered the position that the wealth of the rich may 
consist of clothes and ornaments. 285 " In another place Brhaspati says 
" Bhrgu spoke of sale without ownership after deposit; listen to it 
attentively, I shall speak of it with more details. 286 "This keeps in 
view Manu 8. 4 and clearly shows that Brhaspati was well aware of 
Bhrgu's connection with the extant Manusmrti. Aiigiras as quoted 
in the Smrticandrika ( I. p. 7 ) speaks of the dharmasastra of Manu. 
In the Vajrasuci of Asvaghosa ( ed. by Weber) several verses are 
quoted as from the ' Manavadharma ' which occur in the extant 
Manusmrti, 28 ? though it must be admitted that there are others that

do not occur. In the Ramayana also there are verses cited as from 
Manu which occur in the extant Manusmrti ; vide Kiskindha 18.30-32 
(Gujarati Press, 191 5-1920) where two verses are quoted as 'sung by 
Manu ' which correspond to Manusmrti VIII. 318 and 316 respectively. 

The foregoing discussion of the external evidence shows that 
writers from the 2nd century onwards (if not earlier) looked upon the 
extant Manusmrti as the most authoritative smrti. This position it 
could not have attained unless several centuries intervened between 
it and these writers. Therefore it must be presumed that the 
Manusmrti had attained its present form at least before the 2nd 
century A. D. Even the Mahabhasya contains a verse which is 
Manu II. 120. 288 But as the verse occurs also in the Anu£a- 
sana ( 104. 64-65 ) no chronological conclusion can be drawn 
therefrom. The Pratimanataka ( after V. 8 ) speaks of "manaviya- 
dharmasastra' and 'Priicetasa sraddhakalpa/ but as it is in controversy 
whether that work, can be ascribed to the ancient Bhasa, this 
reference will serve no useful purpose. 

The next question is whether the Manusmrti contains earlier 
and later strata. There can be no doubt on this point. On nume- 
rous points the Manusmrti contains conflicting doctrines. In Manu 
III. 12-13 a Brahmana is allowed to have a kidra woman as wife, 
while in III. 14-19 it is emphatically asserted that a sudra woman 
cannot be the wife of a Brahmana and heavy disabilities are prescrib- 
ed for him who breaks the injunction. In III. 23-26 there are contra- 
dictory statements about the appropriate forms of marriage for the 
several castes. In one breath Manu seems to permit niyoga (9. 59-63) 
and immediately afterwards he strongly reprobates it (9. 64-69). 
The lengthy discussion on flesh-eating in Manu V. 27-56 discloses 
different mentalities. At several places the work seems even to 
recommend flesh-eating in sacrifice, haddhas and madhuparha 
(V. 31-32, 35, 39,41), while elsewhere it recommends total 
abstinence from meat on all occasions whatever (V. 48-50). In

one Sloka ( Manu II. 145 ) the father is said to be equal to a hundred 
acaryas, while in the next verse the aCarya is said to be superior to 
the father. In V. 1 Bhrgu is said to have sprung from fire, while 
in I. 3 5 he is said to be one of the ten sons of Manu Svayambhuva. 
Vide also IX. 32-56. 

Btthler devotes considerable space to this question ( S B E vol. 
25. pp. LXVI-LXXIII ). He arrives at the conclusion that the 
cosmological and philosophical portions in the first and 12th books, 
the philosophical disquisition in II. 89-100, the classifications of 
pitarah in III. 193-201, the means of subsistence for Brahmana in 
IV. 1-24, verses 1-4 of the fifth book, the rules about mixed castes 
( X. 1-74 ) and the duties of castes that are repeated in X. 101-13 1 
were put in when the work was versified from the Manavadharma- 
sutra. Though one may not agree with all the details of Btihler's 
examination and with his theory about the versification of the 
Manavadharmasutra, it may be admitted that most of the passages 
pointed out by him have rather the flavour of comparative moder- 
nism about them. My own position is that the original Manusmrti 
in verse had certain additions made in order to bring it in a line 
with the change in the general attitude of people on several points 
such as those of flesh-eating, niyoga &c. But all these additions 
must have been made long before the 3rd A. D., as the quotations 
from Brhaspati and others show. 

Another problem is whether the Manusmrti has undergone 
several recasts. This does not seem likely and the evidence adduced 
in support of the theory that the Manusmrti suffered several recasts 
is quite inadequate for the purpose. The occurrence of several con- 
flicting passages can as well be explained on the theory of a single 
recast and it has also to be borne in mind, as BQhler points out, that 
Sanskrit writers down to the most recent times are in the habit of 
placing side by side conflicting opinions without actually preferring a 
particular view to others. The tradition of the Naradasmrti that 
the sastra of Manu was successively abridged by Narada, Markapdeya 
and Sumati Bhargava is, as has been observed above, not worth much, 
since it is merely intended to glorify Narada's work. The other 
traditions given above either ignore Narada altogether or assign him 
a secondary position. The present Manusmtti is put into the 
mouth of Bhrgu. Narada's smrti is clearly based upon Manu, though 
the former diverges from the latter on many points. Brhaspat; 



ISO BUtentf 

generally takes Manu as his text and amplifies the dicta of the Manu- 
smrti (as the verses quoted above in notes 28 1 -86 show) and so his work 
may by analogy be regarded as a Vartika on Manu, as Dr. Jolly puts 
it. Aflgiras also looks upon Manusmrti as most authorirative. It is 
therefore that the Pauranic account ( note 270 above ) regards Bhrgu 
and other works as the redactions of the original Manusmrti* The 
quotations cited from Vrddha-Manu and Brhan-Manu do not establish 
that the original Manusmrti underwent many recasts. Quotations 
cited under these names are later than the Manusmrti. ViSvarupa 
( on Yaj. I. 69 ) quotes the views of Vrddha-Manu on niyoga, who 
allows it only to sudras. The Mitaksara quotes a verse from 
Vrddha-Manu about the widow of a sonless man being entitled to 
all her husband's wealth, while Manu is silent on that point. 28 * 
The Mitaksara quotes a verse from Brhan-Manu also ( on Yaj. 
III. 20 ). Madhave quotes a verse from Brhan-Manu about sapipda 
and samanodaka relationship which are expansions of Manu 390 
( V. 60 ). The fact that many quotations ascribed to Manu in 
several works are not found in the extant Manusmrti is explicable 
in several ways and not only by the theory of several recasts. For 
one thing the authors quoting from memory may be found tripping. 
For example, in an inscription of the Badami Calukyas of the 7th 
century two verses that occur in most grants of lands are ascribed 
to Manu, but are not found in the extant Manusmrti. 291 No one 
can for a moment doubt that the extant Manusmrti was an autho- 
ritative work in the 7th century. Therefore there is hardly any 
reliable evidence to support the theory that the Manusmrti suffered 
several recasts. 

Turning now to the internal evidence, the extant Manusmrti 
seems to be much older than Yajnavalkya, since the rules of judicial 
procedure are incomplete and awkward in Manu as compared with 
Yaj., since there is no reference to documents as evidence in Manu,

as ordeals are not treated of in Manu, as legal definitions are almost 
absent in Manu, while frequent in Yaj. and as Manu is silent about 
the widow's rights, while Yaj. gives her the first place among the 
heirs of a son less man. So the Manusmrti will have to be placed 
some centuries earlier than the third century A. D., the latest date 
to which the Yajnavalkya smrti can be assigned with any show of 
reason. In X. 44 Manu mentions the Yavanas, Kambojas, Sakas, 
Pahlavas and Cinas 3 ? 2 and in X. 48 Medas and Andhras. This shows 
that the extant Manusmrti could not be much earlier than 
the 3rd century B. C. The Yona, Kamboja and Gandhara people 
are mentioned in the 5 th rock edict of Asoka. Manu forbids 
Brahmanas to dwell in the kingdom of a Sudra ( IV. 61 ) and 
condemns the appointment of a sudra as a judge ( VIII. 20-21 ). 
The former is possibly a reference to the Mauryas, 
though one cannot be certain of it. Mr. Jayasval (Calcutta Weekly 
Notes, vol. 15, p. CCC ) goes too far in supposing that in the word 
* senapatya ' occurring in Manu ( XII. 100 ) there is a reference to 
Senapati Pusyamitra. The extant Manusmrti in its arrangement and 
doctrines is much in advance of the ancient dharmasutras, such as 
those of Gautama, Baudhayana and Apastamba. Taking all these 
things into consideration Biihler ( S B E vol. 25 p. CXV1I ) was 
certainly right in saying that the extant Manusmrti was composed 
between the second century B. C and 2nd century A. D. But the 
question of the date when the original Manusmrti to which additions 
were made between the 2nd century B. C. and 2nd century A. D. 
was composed presents very great difficulties. That question is 
largely bound up with the relation of the Mahabharata to the 
Manusmrti. 

This question is an extremely intricate one. The late 
V. N. Mandlik ( Intro, to the Vyavaharamayukha XLVII ) held that 
the Manusmrti borrowed from the Mahabharata. Biihler after an 
elaborate examination of the question ( S B E vol 25, pp. LXXIV- 
XCVIII ) came to the conclusion that it was indisputable that the 
1 2th and 13th parvam of the Mahabharata knew a Manavadharma- 
sastra which was closely connected with but not identical with the 
present Manusmrti. BOhler expresses himself very cautiously and 
it^ seems to me that the great scholar was unduly prepossessed^ 

ttrcu

in favour of the Mahabharata as against the Manusmrti. Bflhler 
somewhat contradicts himself when he says that the author of the 
epic only knew the dharmasutras ( S B E vol. 25, p. XCVIII ). 
Hopkins ( Great Epic of India p. 21-22 ) seems inclined to hold that 
the 13th book which alone, according to him, recognises the sastra 
declared by Manu, knew the present Manusmrti, though the earlier 
books cannot be held to have known a sastra of Manu even when 
they employ such expressions as " Manu said. " He thinks that 
there was a floating mass of verses containing philosophical and other 
lore attributed to the mythical Manu on which the earlier books 
of the Mahabharata and the Manusmrti both drew and that the 
matter that is common to both works was not borrowed from any 
systematic treatise. Btihler accepts this view with the slight modi- 
fication that the floating mass of verses was not all attributed to 
Manu ( S B E vol. 25 p. XC ). Before giving my individual views 
on this vexed question as against the array of such eminent scholars 
as Biihler and Hopkins some facts must be clearly set forth. The 
Mahabharata is nowhere mentioned by name in the Manusmrti 
though the word " itihasa " ( in the plural ) occurs in Manu 
(III. 232). The Manusmrti mentions many historical and legendary 
personages, about most of whom the Mahabharata contains similar 
stories. The following are the persons so mentioned in the Manusmrti. 
Adgirasa(in II. 1 51-152, addressing his elders as c putrakah ' ), 
Agastya ( V 22, in connection with sacrificing animals ), Vena, 
Nahusa, Sudas Paijavana and Nimi ( all in VII. 41*, coming to grief 
through insolence ), Prthu, Manu, Kubera and the son of Gad hi 
( VII. 42, benefiting by their good conduct) , Vasistha (in VIII. no, 
taking an oath before king Paijavana), Vatsa (in VIII. 116, under- 
going fire ordeal ), Aksama and Sarangi ( in IX. 23, though of low 
birth respectively were united to Vasisfha and Mandapala ), Daba 
(in IX. 128-129, g ave his daughters to Dharma, Kasyapa and Soma), 
Ajigarta ( in X, 105, who was ready to sacrifice his own son ), 
Vamadeva ( in X, 106, desired dog's flesh to save his life ), Bharad- 
vaja ( in X. 107. who accepted the gift of many cows ), Visvamitra 
( in X. 108, who took from a candala's hand a dog's leg ). Prthu is 
also mentioned (in IX. 44) as the husband of the earth and in IX. 314 
Brahmanas are credited with having made fire all-devourer, the 
ocean undrinkable and the waning ( pthisical ) moon to wax. 
Most of the names mentioned here go far back into Vedic antiquities. 



$1. Tk& Manusmrti 15S 

For example, Vasisjha's oath occurs in Rgveda (VII. 104. 15*'*) and 
the Brhaddevata ( VI. 32-34 ), Ajigarta figures in the Aitareya- 
brahmapa ( VII. 16 ) and Aftgirasa's story occurs in the Tandya- 
maha-brahmapa ( 13. 3. 24 ). Besides the Manusmrti does not say 
that the stories are taken from the great epic. The Mahabharata 
also was not the first to originate these stories but is only a storehouse 
and encyclopaedia of the numerous popular traditions that were 
current in ancient India. When our Manu ( 9. 227 ) says that 
gambling was seen to have produced in former ages deep-rooted 
enmities, it is unnecessary to suppose that there is a reference to the 
Mahabharata, for from Vedic times the evil effects of gambling 
were known (vide Rgveda X. 34) and even the Mahabharata contains 
the same verse ( Udyoga 37. 19 ), though this fact was not noticed 
by Btihler. On the other hand there are numerous passages in the 
Mahabharata scattered over almost all the parvans 9 where occur such 
expressions as, ' Manur-abravid, ' ' the rajadharmas of Manu, ' € the 
iastra of Manu ' etc. Some of these passages agree with the extant 
Manusmrti, while some do not. Besides there are hundreds of 
verses in the Mahabharata that are identical with the verses of the 
Manusmrti, though they are not expressly attributed to Manu. 
Dr. Biihler says that in the Vana, Santi and Anu&sana parvans 
alone he could identify either wholly or partly 260 verses with 
those of our Manu. What then is the conclusion ? Prima facie it 
should be, on account of all these abovementioned facts, against 
the Mahabharata and in favour of the Manusmrti being the earlier 
of the two. Hopkins at all events holds that the Anu&sana-parva 
knew a Manusmrti essentially the same as we have now. Bfkhler 
expresses himself more cautiously and says that the Santi and 
Anuiasana parvans knew a Manava-dharma&stra closely connected 
with the extant one, though not identical. Both are agreed that 
the earlier books when they speak of Manu are either referring to 
the Manava-dharmasfltra or to the floating mass of popular verses, 
but not to our Manu. 

We must now closely examine the data. The Anu&sana-parva 
distinctly speaks of *a &stra declared by Manu.'*" In the Sintiparva 

** wit $ta ^ m^^pft «#i *°- 

■ ■» .......... .. . — * «»_ 



154 History of DharmatilMra 

are quoted two slokas € sung by Manu in his own dharmas, 9 one of 
which is identical with Manu 2 ** ( 9. 321 ). In another place the 
Santiparva speaks of the ' rajadharmas of PracetasaManu ' and quotes 
two verses therefrom. 2 * 6 In the Dronaparva (7. 1) ' Manavi artha- 
vidya ' is referred to ( vide note 272 above ) and in Vanaparva the 
rajadharmas as proclaimed by Manu are referred to ( vide note 272 
above j. In another places, the words ' Manu Svayarhbhuva said * 
occur ( e. g. Santi 21. 12, Anusasana 114. 12, Vanaparva 180. 34-35, 
Adiparva 73. 9, 120. 32-36, Udyoga 37. 1-6). In most cases the 
words ' Manu said occur ' without the appellation 'Svayarhbhuva' or 
Tracetasa' ( e. g. Santi 78. 31, 88. 14-16, 121. 10-12, 152. 14, 152. 30, 
266. 5 ; Anu&sana 44. 18 and 23, 65. 1 and 3, 67. 19, 68. 31, 88. 
4, 115. 52-53 ; Vanaparva 32. 39, Udyogaparva 40. 9-10, Adiparva 
41. 31, 74. 39 ). The words c Manor-anusasanam ' occur in a few 
cases as in Anusasana 61. 34-35. Hopkins says that the words € the 
sastra of Manu ' occur only «n the Anusasana-parva and so only that 
parvan knew the Manusmrti, while in the other parvans we have the 
expression * Manu said, ' and therefore these other books did not 
know the Manusmrti but are only referring to floating verses attri- 
buted to the mythical Manu. This, however, is not a reasonable 
conclusion. The words € sastra of Manu ' occur only once even in 
the Anusasana, while in about ten places in the sweat parvan we come 
across only the words 'Manu said'. If the words ' Manu said* in 
the Anusasana indicate in the Anusasana a reference to the extant 
Manusmpi, there is no cogent reason why the same words in other 
parvans should not be regarded as referring to the Manusmrti. 
Besides in the Santiparva also we meet with the words c Dharmas 
or rajadharmas of Manu ' and in Adiparva the word 'dhanra-dar£ane' 
(120. 32). That is obviously a reference to some*work of Manu. 
Hopkins further says ( Great Epic of India, p. 21 ) that all the

SI. Ths Mamxmrti 1S& 

express citations of Manu in the Anu&sana, except one, agree very 
closely with our Manu, while in the other parvans the citations 
agree only up to one-third or one-half. In the first place I demur 
to the latter statement. The agreements of the citations in the other 
books are as close and almost as frequent as in the Anusasana, e. g. 
excepting Santi 21. 12 and 57.43-45 all citations of Manu tfiferein, 
referred to above, agree closely with Manu 7. 89, 9. 225-26, 9. 17-19 
and 27, 6. 33 and 81, n. 259-60, 5. 43 and 45 and 48-49. The 
same is the case with the few citations of Manu in the Vanaparva . 
Bflhler says that the Mahabharata knew only of the dharmasQtras. 
But there is positively not one express citation attributed by name to the 
well-known writers of dharmasutras, such as Gautama, Baudhayana, 
'.Apastamba, Vasi§(ha or Sankha-Likhita. That the Mahabharata 
knew several dharma&stras is clear from over a dozen references to 
dharmasastras, often in the plural ( e. g. Santi 167. 4, 298. 40, 341. 
74 ; Anu&sana.i9. 89, 45. 17-20, Vanaparva 207. 83, 293. 35, 313. 
105 ; Adiparva 3. 32 and 77 etc. ). The only place where a sutra- 
kara is cited on matters "of dharma is Anu. 19. 6 ; but no name is 
mentioned.**? Hastisutra, Asvasutra are mentioned in Sabha 5. 20, 
but nojiharmasutra or Nitistitra occurs any where. On the other 
hand Btihler is' not; prepared to admit that the views expressly 
attributed^ Manu in the Mahabharata are taken from a treatise and 
refers them to a floating mass of verses the authorship of which was 
unknown andjwas fathered upon the mythical Manu. Distrust of 
ancient Indian authors could. go no further. Biihler's assumptions 
are, to say the least,, gratuitous and are prompted by his unwilling- 
ness to assign an early date to a versified smrti of Manu. Not only 
are there identical verses in Manu and the Mahabharata, but some 
verses of the latter ( e.g. Udyoga 35. 31 and Santi in. 66) occur 
in the Naradasmrti* ( pp. 103 and 26 respectively). In my 
humble opinion the following seems to be the relation of the Maha- 
bharata and the Manusmrti. I must state frankly that it is a mere 
theory, a conjecture whicfrmay.be taken for what it is worth. Long 
before the 4th century B. C, there was a work on Dharmasastra 
composed, by or attributed to Svayambhuva Manu. This work was 
most probably inverse. There was also another work on Raja- 
dharma attributed to Pracetasa Manu, which also was prior to the 

m «ppu ftfa ^ ^Fltf wjTOlSl 3FJo !•••; compare ng 9.18 



#6 Huim&ty^^ 

4th century B. C. It is not unlikely that instead of there being two, 
works there was one comprehensive work embodying rules o% 
dbarma as well as politics. There is one circumstance that points i$ 
this direction. The Mahabharata quotes a saying (vacana) o£ 
Prtcetasa whicn is almost the same as our Manu a * 8 (3. 54 ). It i$ 
to these works (or work ) that Yaska, Gautama, Baudhayana, aijfl 
Kautilya refer whenever they cite the opinions of Manu or the. 
Manavas. The Mahabharata also ( particularly in the earlier, 
portions ) probably refers to the same. This work was the, 
original kernel of the present Manusmrti. Then between. 2nd 
century B. C. and 2nd century A. D. the Manusmrti was finally, 
recast, probably by Bhrgu. That work must have compressed the 
older works in some cases and expanded it in others. This hypothesis 
would explain why some of the verses and views quoted as Menu's 
occur in the extant Manusmrti and why some do not. 3 ** In my opi? 
nion the extant Mahabharata is later than the extant Manusmrti. When, 
Narada mentions the tradition that Sumati Bhargava compressed th$. 
vast work of Manu into 4000 verses, he is somewhat obscurely 
hinting at the truth. The extant Manusmrti contains only about 
2700 verses. Narada probably arrives at the larger figure by including, 
the verses attributed to Vrddha-Manu and Brhan-fylanu. The in- 
fluence of the Manusmrti spread even beyond the confines of India. 
In A. Bergaigne's c Inscriptions Sanscrites de Campa et du, 
Cambodge ' ( p. 423 ) we have an inscription in which occur 
verses/*** one of which is identical with Manu (II. 136) 
and the other is a summary of Manu ( III. 77-80 ).

The Burmese are governed in modern times by the dhatnm&tbato: 
which are based on Manu. Vide Dr. Forchhammer's essay on the- 
sources and development of Burmese Law ( 1885, Rangoon)* 
Dr. E. C. G. Jonker ( Leyden 1885 ) wrote a dissertation on an 
pld Javanese lawbook compared with Indian sources of law like th* 
Manusmjti ( which is still used as a lawbook in the island of Bali), 

Manu had numerous commentators. As to Medhatithi, 
Govindaraja and Kulluka, vide below sections 63, 76, 8ft; 
Besides these Narayana, Raghavananda, Nandana and Rao&r 
candra also wrote commentaries on Manu. Mr. Mandlik 
published all these commentaries. Dr. Jolly published ( in i88f 
for Bengal Asiatic Society ) extracts from all these commentaries 
(except Kulluka's and Ramacahdra's ) and from an anonymous 
Kashmirian commentary on the first three chapters. Asahaya seems 
to have written a commentary on Manu ( vide below section 58 )* 
The Vivadaratnakara quotes a commentary on Manu by Udayakai*. 
(PP* 455> 560, 583, 590). The same work seems to suggest that 
Bhaguri wrote a commentary on Manu.* 00 For the predecessors of- 
Medhatithi vide sec. 63. Kulluka on Manu 8. 184 tells us that 
Bhojadeva arranged the four verses of Manu 8. 1 81-184 ip a 
particular manner and therefore suggests that Bhojadeva probably, 
commented on Manu. He also names a commentator Dharanidhara 
on Manu 2. 83 and says that he was later than Medhatithi. He is 
also referred to elsewhere by Kulluka ( on Manu 4. 50 ). 

The commentator Narayana is certajfly earlier than 1600. A. D, 
as his commentary is cited by Bhattoji in his commentary on tb* 
Caturvimsatimata ( vide p. 61 of the Benares Sanskrit Series edition, 
1907 ). A ms. of Narayana's commentary was written in 1497 A. D. 
and he appears to have been quoted by Rayamukufa in 1431 A. D.. 
( Jolly in R. und. S. p. 3 1 ). He is later than Govindaraja and 
flourished between 1 100 and 1300 A. D. Raghavananda mentions by. 
name Medhatithi, Govindaraja, Narayana, and Kulluka and so is latc& 
than about 1400 A. D. When Nandana flourished it is difficult to 
say. But he is a late writer. There are several other commentator*.

mentioned in the catalogues of mss. who may be passed over for 
want of space. 

Viivarupa ( on Yaj. I. 69 ), the Mitaksara, the Smrticandrika, 
the Para&ramadhaviya and other works quote dozens of verses from 
Vrddha-Manu on ahnika, vyavahdra, and prdyaicitta. The Mitaksart 
( on Yaj. III. 20) and other works cite a few verses from Brhan~ 
Manu. No independent works going under these names have yet 
been unearthed. Those works, if they ever existed independently, 
appear to have been later than our Manu. For example, our Manu is 
silent about the widow's right to inherit to her husband, but Vrddha- 
Manu recognises the right of a chaste widow to take the entire 
wealth of her husband ( Mit. on Yaj. II. 136); similarly Brhan- 
Manu (according to the Mit. ) seems to refer to Manu's view about 
the meaning of ' samanodaka ' ( Manu 5. 60 ) and modifies it. It is 
not unlikely that those verses which were not recognised as Manu's 
by ancient commentators like Medhatithi and were yet found in 
the mss. of the Manusmrti were regarded as Vrddha- or Brhan- 
Manu. 

3a. The Two Epics 

The two epics, particularly the Mahabharata, contain in 
numerous places passages bearing on dharmasastra and are relied 
upon as authoritative Smrtis in later works. The Mah&bharata is 
styled a dharmasastra in the Adiparva ( 2. 83 ). 

The Ramayana is pre-eminently a kavya ; yet on account of its 
noble ideals it was almost % popular as the Mahabharata and is 
relied upon as a source of dharma in the nibandhas though much less 
frequently than the other great epic. The Ayodhya-kaijda ( canto 
100) and the Aranya-kanda ( 33 ) contain disquisitions on politics 
and state administration. The Smrticandrika ( I. p. 57 ) quotes the 
well-known verse of the Ramayana (Sundara 59. 31) about cessation 
of study on the first day of a month.' 01 The Smrticandrika (I. p. 
193 and III. p. 416) quotes two verses on tarpana and iraddha 
from the Ramayana.' 02 The Haralata (pp. 64 and 152) quotes 



The second verse is almost the same at AyodbyS 103. 30 and Ayodhjrl

$2. TU Two Hpics 159 

verses from the Ramayana. Apararka on Yaj. III. 8-10 quotes four 
verses from the Ramayana on sorrow for the dead. 

For considerations of space it is impossible to enter into any 
discussion as to the age of these two epics, as to the earlier and later 
strata in them and other allied questions. These questions are 
passed over here as more appropriate to separate treatises on the 
epics. The following works will give some idea of the problems 
connected with these two great heirlooms of Indian antiquity : —

Qldenberg ( Gottingen, 1922); Das Mahabharata als Epos und

with the com. of Nilakantha has been used.

33. The Puranas. 

The Puranas as a class of literature existed from very ancient times. 
Tai. Ar.(II. 10) speaks of "Brahmanas, Itihasas, Purapas, and 
Nara&msi gathas,"* * In the Chandogya Upanisad (VII. 1. 2 and 4 ) 
" itihasa-puraoa " is spoken of as the fifth Veda and the Brha- 
daraiiyaka (IV. 1. 2) speaks of " Itihasa and Puraga. " The Gau- 
tama Dh. S. (8. 6 and 11. 19) refers to " itihasa" and " Purana. " 
It is not unlikely that there was originally a single work called 
Puraga. The words of the Matsya that in former ages there was a 
single Purana probably embody a tradition that has a substratum 304 
of truth. The Mahabha?ya of Patafijali (vol. I. page 9.) speaks of 
Purana in the singular. The Ap. Dh. S. quotes the views of a 
Purana, twice cites two verses from a Puraiia, and summarizes the view 
of a Bhavi§yat-puranaJ°* The quotations show that the Purana or

to. ThePurUxtas 161 

Puranas contained verses and were composed in a somewhat archaic 
language. The extant Purapas are recasts made of the ancient 
Puranas during the first centuries of the Christian era, when there 
was a revival and restatement of the ancient Brahmanical religion, 
philosophy and literature after the onslaughts of Buddhism and 
Jainism had abated in their strength and fury. The Mahabharata 
(Vana. 191. 16) speaks of the Purana promulgated by Vayu(i. e. the 
Vayupuraoa). Bana in his Harsacarita refers to the recitation of 
the Vayupurana. Kumarilabhatta in his Tantravartika(vide J. B. B. 
R. A. S. for 1925, p. 122) refers to the subjects dealt with by many 
of the extant puranas and quotes passages that occur in the Visnu 
and Markaiideya puranas. Thus it is clear that at any rate some 
of the extant puranas, if not all, are much earlier than the 6th 
century A. D. 

The orthodox number of the principal puranas is 18 and there 
are 18 Upapuranas also. There is considerable divergence about 
the names of the 18 principal puranas. For example, the Matsya- 
purana (chap. 53 ) enumerates them as follows : — Brahma, Padma, 
Visnu, Vayu, Bhagavata, Naradiya, Markandeya, Agneya, Bhavisya, 
Brahmavaivarta, Linga, Varaha, Skanda, Vamana, Kurma, Matsya, 
Garuda and Brahmanda. The Visnu-purana (3.6) on the other hand 
omits Vayu from the above list and adds Saiva. The Sarasvati- 
vilasa ( p. 14 ) follows the Visnu-purana. Vide Bhagavata-purapa 
XII. 13. 4-8 and commentary thereon for the Purarias and Upa- 
puranas. 

Among comparatively early commentators and writers of digests, 

it is Aparkrka, Ballalasena and Hemadri that quote most profusely from 

the puranas as sources of dharma. We saw above (p. 146) that Kulltika 

describes passages of the Bhavisya-purana as glosses on Manu. The 

Matsya-puraria is pre-eminently a work containing much dharmasastra 

material. For example, chapters 16-22 deal with sraddha, chapters 

55-57 and 59-82 with vratas, chap. 54, 83, 278 with gifts, chap. 93 

with santis, chap. 102 with tirthas. Similarly in chapters 216-243 

the Matsya speaks of rajadharma. The Vi§nupurapa ( in III, chap. 

8-16) contains a good deal of information on the duties of the varnas 

and airamasi nitya and naimittika acts, good manners for a house- 

jlder, the five great yajiias, Jatakarma and other samskaras, impu- 

on death, Sraddha &c. Vispudharmottara (VeAkafesvara Press) 

1 2nd kha$4a contains several chapters dealing with matters of 

a. d. ait 



62 History flf DkahnaHUn 

dharma, e. g. chap. 24 gives the qualifications of state officers, chap. 
65-72 speak of rajadharma, expedients of policy, punishments, 
73-74 deal with prayascittas, 75 with impurity on death and birth, 
79 with purification of dravyas, 80-81 with the four var^as and 
mixed castes, 60 with various purely legal matters. The Agni- 
purana also in chapters 220-225, 227, 233-242 contains a disquisi- 
tion on rajadharma. Almost the whole of the vyavahara section in the 
Yajnavalkyasmrti occurs in chapters 253-258 of the Agnipura^a 
j( Anandasrama edition ) and many verses in chap. 253 are identical 
with verses of the Narada-smrti. The Garudapurana (chap. 93-106) 
contains about 400 verses that are taken from the first and third 
sections of Yajiiavalkya though not in the same order. 

The chronology of the puranas is, like that of the epics, a subject 
full of perplexing problems and is hence passed over here. 

The annexed table will give an idea as to what topics of 
dharmasastra are dealt with in the principal puranas. 

The constitution of the original text of the puranas is a Herculean 
task which has not yet been attempted. Not only is there difference 
of opinion among the puranas about the names of the 18 Maha- 
Puranas, but there is divergence as regards the extent of the several 
puranas. For example, the commentator Vis^ucitta of the Visnu- 
purana says ( on III. 6. 20-22 ) that the extent of the Vi§nupurana 
is variously given at 8000, 9000, 10000, 22000, 24000, but that he 
comments on a text of 6000 slokas only. The Agnipuraiia ( 272, 
10-1 1 ) says that it contains 12000 slokas, while the Bhagavata ( XII. 
13 ), the Brahmavaivarta, the Padma(adi. 62 ) say that it contains 
15400 slokas and the Skanda (V. 3) and the Matsya 53 give the extent 
of the Agni as 16000. The^Kurma, according to the Bhagavata 
contains 17000, according to the Matsya 18000 and only 8000 
according to the Agni ( 272. 19). Though there is a remarkable 
continuity in India as to religious thoughts and practices, yet the 
popular religion oflnodern Hindus is pre-eminently pauranic. The 
puranas contain thousands of slokas on dharmasastra matters, they 
are a rich mine awaiting exploration by careful students of social and 
religious questions and shed a flood of light on the development of 
religious beliefs and practices in medieval and modern India. Thj^pj 
fore the re-constitution of the text of the purapas is a problem ^^. 
wilj have to be tackled in the near future. Besides the several „_. ^f 



8$. totPurOoaB 163 

puranas, eighteen Upapuranas also are enumerated in some of the 
Puranas. Vide Garuda (223. 17 fF), Skanda (V. 3. chap. I. 45-62 
and VII. I. chap. 2 ), Padma ( Patala-khanda chap. in. 95-98 ) and 
Matsya (53. 59 ff) for Upapuranas.* ** Besides the Mahapuranas and 
Upapuragas, there are other works of the purana class such as 
Gapeia, Maudgala, Devi, Kalki &c* The Padmapurana ( Uttara- 
khapda chap. 263 ) divides the 18 puranas into three groups, 
sattvika, rajasa and tawasa, and says that the Visnu, Naradiya, 
Bhagavata, Garuda, Padma, and Varaha are sattvika. The Matsya 
(53) also speaks of this division. The Litigapurana (39. 63-66) speaks 
of the twenty expounders of dharma just as Yajnavalkya does and 
quotes the two verses in the form in which the Mit. presents them 
( and not Visvarupa), while the Padma ( Uttarakhaqda 263. 86-89 ) 
divides the eighteen smrtis into three groups of sattvika, rajasa and 
tatnasa.*°* h It would be quite clear to any reader of the puranas and 
the smrtis that most of the former in their extant form are later 
than the smrtis of Manu, Yajnavalkya, Parasara, Narada &c. 

The following table will give some idea as to how the eighteen 
principal puranas are rich in dharma&stra material. Besides the 
eighteen principal puranas, the Kalika-purana ( Veftkatesvara press 
ed. ) and the Saura-purana ( Anandasrama ed. ) have been drawn 
upon. The Anandasrama edition of the Agni and Padma, the 
Nirnayasagara edition ( 1905 ) of the Bhagavata, the Poona edition 
(1870 Jagaddhitecchu Press) of the Matsya have been referred to 
here and the Vehkatesvara editions of all the other puranas.

34. The Yajnavalkyasmrti 

This Smrti has been published dozens of times. In the 
following the Nirnayasagara edition edited by Sastri Moghe ( 1892 
A- D. ) has been used and the Trivandrum edition when speaking 
ofViSvarapa. 

The name of Yajnavalkya is one of the most illustrious among 
Vedic sages. He is credited with having promulgated the White 
Yajurveda. In the Santiparva ( chap. 312) wc are told that there 
was a rupture between Vaisampayana and his pupil Yajnavalkya 
and that by worshipping the Sun the latter received the revelation 
of the White Yajurveda, the Satapatha &c. The accounts in the 
Vi$ou(3. 5 ), the Bhagavata (XII. 6. 61-74) an< * other pura^as 
differ somewhat from the one in the Mahabharata, but all agree on 
the fact of the strained relations between Yajiiavalkya and his teacher. 
The Satapatha Brahmana in several places alludes to the dialogues oi 
Yajiiavalkya and king Janaka of Videha on agnihotra ( S. B. E. vol. 
44 P* 46 )• Vide Satapatha ( ed. by Weber) XI. 6. 2. At the end of 
die Satapatha we are told that Vajasaneya Yajnavalkya promulgated 
the bright Yajus formulae from the Sun.* 06 In the Brhadarariyaka 
Upanisad Yajnavalkya appears as a great philosopher teaching the 
recondite doctrines of Brahma and immortality to one of his two 
wives, the philosophically minded Maitreyi ( II. 4 and IV. 5 ). In 
the same Upanisad Yajnavalkya is represented as carrying away the 
one thousand cows set apart by Janaka for the most learned 
Brahmana ( III. 1. i-2 ) and Yajnavalkya is said to have imparted to 
Janaka the knowledge of the destiny of the soul after it is released 
from the bonds of flesh and worldly affections. Katyayana in his 
Vartika on Paiiini (IV. 3. 105 )'°7 speaks of the Brahmanas of 
Yajnavalkya and very heated controversies have raged round the 
correct interpretation of the Vartika and the Mahabhasya thereon 
( vide Max Miiller's Ancient Sanskrit Literature p. 360, Goldstficker's 
Panini, p. 132 S and S. B. E. vol. 12 pp. xxxv-xxxvm ). It 
is to be noted that in the Yajnavalkyasmrti itself' 08 ( III. no ) the

34. The 1fcjilaval1<ya8mrti 169 

author, whoever he may be, claims the authorship of the Aranyaka 
that he received from the Sun and the Yogasastra composed by him. 
This is simply put in to glorify the Y.ijnavalkya-smrti as the work 
of a great and ancient sage, philosopher and yogin. From the 
style and the doctrines of the smrti it is impossible to believe that 
it was the work of the same hand that gave to the world the 
Upanisad containing the boldest philosophical speculation couched 
in the simplest yet the most effective language. Even orthodox 
Indian opinion was not prepared to admit the unity of authorship 
in the case of the smrti and the Aranyaka. The Mitaksara says at 
the beginning that a certain pupil of Yaj. abridged the dharmasastra 
in the form of a dialogue. 509 It will be shown later on that, though 
the sage who promulgated the Aranyaka and the author of the 
smrti cannot be identical, yet the Yajnavalkya-smrti is much more 
closely connected with the White Yajurveda and the literature 
particularly belonging to it than with any other Veda. 

The Yajnavalkyasmrti contains ( in the Nirnayasagara ed. of 
1892 ) 1 010 verses, while the Trivandrum edition with the 
commentary of Visvarupa contains 1003 verses and Apararka gives 
1006 (Anandasrama edition). The difference in the number is 
mostly due to the fact that Visvarupa in the first section on &c3ra 
omits five verses that occur in the Mitaksara. J 10 As regards one of 
them (the verse 'rathyakardamatoyani 5 1. 197 according to the Mit.) 
Visvarupa notices it and says that some read it after the verse 
"mukhaja viprusa" and that it adds nothing to what precedes. 
Apararka explains that verse. In the second section on vyavahara 
Visvarupa reads verses*" which do not exist in the Mitaksara nor in 
Apararka. On the other hand Visvarupa seems to doubt the 
authenticity of the well-known verse on re-union and reads it also

differently *' * ( anyodaryasya sarhsrsti ). Not only this but in some 
cases the arrangement of verses is not the same in both Visvarupa 
and the Mit. . For example, verses 14-29 of the prayascitta section 
present very different sequences in both. What is verse 29 in the 
Trivandrum edition is verse 19 in the Mit. Besides the Mit. reads 
one verse ( III. 23 a dantajanmanah &c. ) which is wanting in 
VisvarGpa and is also not commented upon by Apararka. ViSvarfipa 
adds two half verses,* 1 * which do not occur in the Mit. and Apariirka. 
There is further a good deal of variance in the readings adopted by 
Visvarupa and the Mit., though the meaning is not often affected. 
For example, the two verses enumerating the names of writers on 
dharma are differently worded in both.* 1 * But Medhatithi favours 
the reading of Visvarupa.* 1 * Visvarupa reads "asvattam 
lokavidvistam" (I. 155 ) and notices a reading "asvantam", while 
the Mit. reads "asvargyam Ioka-&c". Both the Mit. and Apararka 
read "pita pitamaho bhrata &c." ( I. 63 ), while Visvarupa reads 
"pita miitamaho bhrata", remarks that "matamaha" is put in earlier 
as a guardian for marriage for metrical reasons and then notices 
"pita pitamaho bhrata" as a various reading. Even in the days of 
Visvarupa there were various readings in Yaj. ( Vide com. on I. 1, 2, 
5r,II. 119, 179 etc.). 

The Agnipurana affords an excellent check for the consideration 
of the text of the Yajnavalkyasmrti. A good-sized monograph 
tyill be required to deal exhaustively with the questions raised by 
the comparison of the vyavahara portion of the Agnipurana with 
Yajiiavalkya's vyavahara-kanda. I shall only briefly examine the 
materials and state the conclusions at which I have arrived. We 
know that Visvarlipa, the first extant commentator of Yaj., flourish- 
ed about 800-825 A. D. The author of the Mitaksara flourished 
about 2 jo years later. Interesting results follow by a comparison 
of the text that these two commentators had before them with the

94. The YSjUavalkyasmrli 171 

Agnipurana. I shall select chap. 256 of the Agnipuraiin for a detail- 
ed examination. It contains 36 verses which all occur in Yaj. II. 
(verses 1 18-153 of Tri. ed. and verses 1 14-149 of the Mit. ). It is 
found that the Agnipurana agrees with the text of 12 verses word 
for word as contained in Visvarupa and 19 verses as contained in 
the Mit. Visvarupa puts three verses between the two verses 
'pitrdravyavinafena &c* and 'kramadabhyagataih dravyaih', while the 
Mit. brings the two verses together. Agnipurana agrees with Vis, 
In several cases the readings of the Agnipurana agree with Visva- 
rupa's text and not with that of the Mit- For example, Agni. reads 
€ karyah patnyah samariisikah ' with Vis. (119), reads c bhurya . . . 
dravyam-eva va . . . putrasya cobhayoli * with Vis. (124), reads 
' pitrdravyavinasena ' (and not * O vyavirodhena' as Mit. does )witl) 
Vis. (122), reads * dadyat-capaharec-camsarii ' with Vis. ( 142 b ), 
reads * patitas-tatsutah klibah' with Vis. ( 144 a ), reads * aprajaya- 
matltayam , with Vis. ( 148 ). The Agnipurana however in a far 
larger number of cases agrees with the readings of the Mit. Agni 
(256. g) reads with the Mit. (122) 'vibhaktesu sutojatah savarnayarh 
vibhagabhak,' Agni. (256. 10) reads c matapyamsam samaifi haret 1 
with the Mit. (123), while Vis. (127) reads ' matapyamsam sama-? 
pnuyat/ Visvarupa's reading leaves it undecided as to what the share 
of the mother is to be, while the Mit. makes it definite by stating 
that it is equal ( to that of a son ). Agni (256. 12) reads € catusr 
tri-dvyeka-bhagah syuh ' and ' vidjastu dvyekabhaginah ' with the 
Mit. (125) ; Agni. (256. 21) reads '-rdhabhagikam' with the Mit. 
(134). Agni. ( 256. 27 ) reads ' andho'cikitsyarogadya * with th§ 
Mit. (140), while Vis. (144) reads c rogi ca. ' The reading of 
the Mit. makes provision by the word 'adya' for othei 
persons like deaf-mutes mentioned in other smrtis as not 
entitled to inherit, while Vis. has to put a forced interpretation 
on c ca' as including such persons. The Agni (256.33) reads 
'vyayaift dadyac-ca sodayam' with the Mit. ( 146 ), while Vis. ( 150) 
reads Mapyas-ca sodayam'. Agni ( 256. 36 ) reads 'vibhagabhavanfc 
jneya grha-ksetrais-ca yautakaih' with the Mit. ( 149 ), while Vi£. 
( 153 ) reads *°bhavanadeyagrha-ksetrakayautakaih\ Here the 
former reading is easy and gives a complete sentence. With Vis. 
we have to separate ' bhavana' and c adeya &c.\ Besides no predicate 
(like jneya or karya ) is expressly mentioned in the verse if we take 
the reading of Vis. and the *ka' in 'ksetraka* is a redundancy. We 
find that the tendency of the readings of the Mit. js to smooth down 



178 History of DharmaiUttra 

harsh or involved constructions and that the Agnipurana presents 
most of the changes in the text found in the Mit. but not found in 
Vi£. In the same direction points the fact that Agni (256. 35) reads 
c na dattam stridhanam yasyai' with the Mit. ( 148 ) and not 'yasya* 
as Vis. (152 ) docs, as 'yasyai* is grammatically more regular than 
'yasyah' with the form 'dattam'. But as against this we may note 
that both Vis. and Agni read 'aprajayamatltayam', while the Mit. 
reads ' atltayamaprajasi \ The reading c aprajasi * is correct 
according to Panini ( V. 4. 122) and not 'aprajayam'. Therefore the 
conclusion that follows is that the text of Yaj. preserved in the Agni- 
purana is intermediate between the text of Visvarupa and that of the 
Mitaksara. As Visvarupa flourished about 800-825 A. D., the Agni- 
purana represents a text of Yajnavalkya current somewhat later i. e. 
about 900 A. D. In my 'History of Sanskrit Poetics' ( pp. III-V ) 
I established, from the fact that the extant Agnipurana quotes 
Dandin and Bhamaha and knew the theory of dbvani, that it was 
composed about 900 A. D. That date is strikingly corroborated by 
the evidence derived from the chapters on vyavahara discussed above. 
It is no doubt true that the Agni presents some readings that are found 
neither in Vis. nor in the Mit. For example, it reads (256.4) 
c tabhya rte 'rpayet ', while both Vis. and Mit. read c tabhya rte'nv- 
yah \ It is probable that this is an error of the copyists or the 
reading may be due to the difficulty of understanding the meaning 
of 'anvayah* there. Agni reads ( 256. 5) ' svayam - arjayet ' for 
'svayam - arjitam ' ( of Vis. and Mit.), and 'jatopi dasyarh sudrasya* 
(256.20) for ' sudrena' (of Vis. and Mit.). A detailed exa- 
mination of the other chapters on vyavahara will yield the same 
results. But it cannot be undertaken here. A few examples may 
however be cited. Vis. (II. 167) reads ' palo yesam ca te 
mocya daiva- rajapariplutah \ Agni (257. 14) € palo yesam 
tu te mocya daivarajapariplutah ', while Mit. ( 163 ) reads 
'palo yesam na te . . . tah \ Similarly Vis. (II. 179) and 
Agni ( 257. 26 ) read c svakutumbavirodhena deyam ' while the 
Mit. ( 175 ) reads ' svam kutumbavirodhena '. Vis. ( II. 203 ) reads 
'galat-sabhikavrddhistu', while both Agni (257. 49) and Mit. 
( 199) read 'glahe satikavrddhestu ', which certainly is an easier 
reading. Agni 258. 45 occurs in Mit. ( 255 ), but is wanting in 
VisvarCpa. Yaj. II. 228 in Vis. becomes in the Mit, verse 263, 
Agni. following the order of Visvarupa, 



84. The YcLjnavalkyaamrH 17$ 

The total number of verses on vyavahara in Agnipurana, chap. 
253-258, is 315. Out of this the first 31 are not taken from Yaj. 
All of them except the first half verse and verse 31 (chap. 253) 
occur in Narada. Of the remaining 284 verses, only 4^ (Agni 253. 
35, 255. 43a, 255. 49b and 50, 258. 83 ) do not occur in Yaj. ( in 
both Vis. and Mit. ). There are also a few verses that occur in the 
Agnipurana and in Visvanipa, but not in the Mit. and also a few 
verses that are common to the Mit. and Agni but are not found in 
Vis. The first three verses of Yaj. Hare compressed by the Agni- 
purana into 1^4 verses. 

The Garudapurana affords, like the Agnipurana, material help 
towards examining the authoritativeness of the text of the first and 
third sections of Yaj. The Agnipurana does not expressly say that 
it drew upon Yaj., but the Garudapurana is explicit on the point. 
In chap. 93. 1. it is expressly said that the dharma formerly pro- 
mulgated by Yajnavalkya is being narrated ' Yajnavalkyena yat 
( yah ? ) purvam dharmam (dharmah ?) proktam ( °tah ?) katham 
Hare \ tan me kathaya kesighna yatha tattvena Madhava if. Chapters 
93-106 contain dharmasastra material more or less taken from the 
Yajnavalkysmrti. There are 376 verses in these chapters. Considera- 
tions of space forbid any detailed examination of this material. 
A few salient facts only are brought out here. Chapters 93-102 
deal with the several topics ( prakaranas ) of the first kanda in the 
same order, the only exception being the topic of rajadharma 
(I. 309-368), which is omitted in the Garudapurana. Chapters 
102-106 treat of topics that occur in the third kanda of Yaj. and 
contain 121 verses only. In these chapters the order of the 
prakaranas in Yaj. is*not observed at all, but Garuda speaks of them 
in the following order, vanaprastha-prakarana, yati, karmavipaka, 
prayascitta, asauca and apaddharma (the last two being the first 
two prakaranas in Yaj.). A feature which strikes one as regards 
the Garudapurarta (particularly chap. 102-106) is that a few verses 
only of Yaj. are repeated word for word, that very often the Garuda- 
purana gives only a summary by omitting and transposing the 
words and phrases of the original and that sometimes it adds verses 
of its own. This may be illustrated by what the Garuda says on 
vanaprastha and yati (chap. 102-103, 12 verses in all). Chap. 102 
begins € vanaprasthaSramam vak§ye tac-chrnvantu maharsayah 1

b-5a ; III. 48 = 3b-4a ; III. 49-50 = Garuda 5b ( c pakse masetha va- 
Smyad-dantolukhaliko bhavet, which summarises and retains some 
words of the original ), HI. 71 = Garuda 102. 6a (candrayanisvaped* 
bhumau karma kuryat phaladina, which includes a few words of 
III. 49b also), III. 52 = Garuda 6b~7a (the last pada in Garuda is 
'yogabhyasat dinam nayet ', while in Yaj. it is '£akty& 
v3pi tapas caret ' ), III. 53 = Garuda 102. 7. Chap. 203 
contains only five verses. III. 56, 58-59 = Garuda 103. ib-4a 
(with variants) and then Garuda adds \\fa verses which are not found 
in Yaj. ( viz. 'bhavet-paramahamso va ekadaridi yamaditah \\ siddha- 
yogas-tyajan deham-amrtatvam-ihapnuyat I datatithipriyo jfiani 
grhi sraddhepi mucyate u' ). The mere fact that a prakarana is 
omitted in the Garudapurana should cast no doubt on the existence 
of that prakarana in the original Yaj. We do not know on what 
principles the borrowing took place. Besides we find that such 
prakaranas as Vinayaka&inti and grahasanti are included in the 
Garuda (chap. 1 00-101 ), while rajadharma-prakarana is omitted. 
We know that 'rajadharma' figures in the sutras and Manu, but none 
of the ancient dharmasutras, nor the Manusmpii speaks of Vinayaka. 
Hence conclusions must be drawn only from what positively occurs 
in the Garudapurana and not from the absence of any topic in it. 
The Garudapurana sometimes follows the arrangement and form of 
the verses presented in Vi£., sometimes it agrees with the Mit. and 
sometimes it is independent. For example, the two verses enume- 
rating the authors of dharmasastras (Yaj. 1. 4-5 = Garuda 93. 4-5) 
follow the readings of Vis., but not those of the Mit. In the 3rd 
kanda, verses 14-19 of the Mit. are differently arranged by Vi£., 
and Vis. omits (as does Apararka also) one verse found in the Mit. 
(III. 23) as said above, while the Mit. omits two half verses that 
are found in Vis. ( vide note 313 ). The verse 'a danta &c.' occurs 
in the Garudapurana and the two half verses in Vis. omitted by the 
Mit. are also omitted in Garuda. So far the Garudapurana agrees 
with the arrangement preserved in the Mit. But it does not agree 
entirely with the Mit. The verse 'adahta &c* is III. 23 in the Mit. 
and occurs before 'ahastvadatta ' but in the Garuda it occurs before 
( triratram dasaratram va' (which is III. 18 in the Mit.). Besides verse 
%% of the Mit. is read differently in the Garuda ( dasa dvadaSa varty}- 



84: The ¥8jftavaltcya*mrti 175 

nam tatha pancadasaiva ca i trimSad dinani ca tatha bhavati preta- 
sQtakam ). It must therefore be said that the Garudapurana 
represents an intermediate stage of readings between Vis, and the 
Mit. As the Garudapurana was a popular work read by and recited 
for the benefit of slightly educated or illiterate people, it often 
introduces changes to suit their understanding. For example, the 
Mit. ( I. 296 ) reads ( as also Vis. ) 'sfiryah somo mahiputrah soma- 
putro brhaspatib ', while Garuda reads ( chap. 101. 2 ) 'suryah somo 
maftgalai ca budhai caiva bjrhaspatih/ thus substituting the well- 
known words Mangala and Budha for mahiputra and somaputra. 
The verse ' krtagnikaryo bhuiijita' ( I. 31 in the Mit. ) is placed by 
Vis. after ' ekadesam - upadhyaya,' while the Mit. places it three 
verses earlier. The Garudapurana here agrees with the Mit. In some 
cases Garuda strikes an independent path. For example, in Yaj. 
I. 1 1 Vis. reads ' mase'to jatakarma ca, ' the Mit. reads * masyete 
jatakarma ca* while Garuda ( chap. 93. 11 ) gives the easy reading 
c prasave jatakarma ca\ Mit. reads ( Yaj. I. 76 b ) € tyajan dapyas- 
tniyamsam-adravyo bharanam striyah '; Vis. omits the whole verse, 
while Garuda omits I. 76a ( of Mit. ) and reads the other half as 
'suddham tyajamstrtiyamfem dadyadabharanam striyah ' ( 95. 23b). 
Verses I. 91-92 of the Mit. on the offspring of mixed marriages are 
differently read by Vis. ( I. 90-91 ), while the Garuda ( 96. ib ) has 
the same half verse as the Mit. I. 91a and the same half verse 
( 96. 3 a ) as Vis. ( 91b ) and reads the two half verses between them 
as ' jato'mbasthastu sudrayarii nisadah parvatopi va II mahisyab 
ksatriyajjato vaisyayam mlecchasamjnitah \ 

The foregoing makes it clear that the text that the Garudapurana 
had before it could not have been older than that commented upon 
by Visvarilpa and that it represents a stage intermediate between 
ViL and the Mit. 

The above gives rise to an important question whether one can 
detect several strata in the Yajnavalkyasmrti. From the fact that 
the sQtra of Sankha-Likhita cites Yajfiavalkya among the promul- 
gators of dharma&stras (vide note 137), while Yaj. himself includes 
Saftkha-Likhita among the propounders of dharma (note 258), it 
may be plausibly said that Sarikha-Likhita refer to an earlier 
Yajnavalkyasmrti than the extant one. Beyond this there is no 
evidence to establish that there was an earlier version of the present 
smrti. A comparison of the readings of ViSvarupa and the Mit. 



if 6 History of DhatmaiUstra 

with those in the Agni and Garuda puranas has established that 
the text of the smrti no doubt underwent slight verbal changes 
between 800 and 1100 a. d. and that a few verses were added and also 
omitted during these centuries. But the text remained in the 
main the same from 700 a. d. What the original smrti contain- 
ed, whether it was in prose or verse or both and whether it dealt 
with only acara and prayascitta sections are questions on which 
conjectures may be advanced, but there are no substantial materials 
for arriving at even tolerably certain conclusions. 

Yajnavalkya's work is more systematic than that of Manu. He 
divides the work into three sections and relegates all topics to their 
proper positions and avoids repetition. He treats of almost all 
subjects that we find in Manu, but his treatment is always concise 
and he makes very great and successful efforts at brevity. The 
result is that for the 2700 verses of Manu, he requires only a little 
over a thousand. He often compresses two verses of Manu into one, 
e. g. Manu II. 243, 247T248 are equal to Yaj. I. 49, Manu III, 
46-48 and 50 are concisely put in one verse by Yaj. (I. 79); vide also 
Manu IV. 7-8 and Yaj. 1. 128 (contain almost same words also), Manu 
IV. 84-85 and Yaj. I. 141. In a few cases Manu and Yaj. convey 
the same meaning in one verse without compression, e. g. 
Manu III. 70 and Yaj. I. 102, Manu III. 119 and Yaj. I. no, Manu 
VII. 171 and Yaj. I. 348, Manu VII. 205 and Yaj. I. 349. The 
correspondence of Yajnavalkya's words with the text of Manu is in 
most cases very close, so much so that one cannot help feeling that 
Yaj. had the Manusnirti before him and purposely made an attempt 
to abridge the somewhat loose expressions of Manu. The passages 
set forth above- as examples of compression will also serve as 
illustrations of this fact. The word Kaya (from Ka) is used by both 
in the sense of c prajapatya form of marriage ' ( Manu III. 38 and 
Yaj. I. 60); vide also Manu II. 109 and Yaj. I. 28, Manu III. 
43-44 and Yaj. I. 62, Manu V. 26-27 an d Yaj. I. 178-179, Manu 
VII. 56 and Yaj. I. 312 for further close agreement in phraseology. 
Yaj. adds some subjects which have either no counterpart in our 
Manu or which are only noticed in passing by Manu. The Manu- 
smrti contains nothing corresponding to the Vinayakasanti and 
Graha&nti of Yaj. ( I. 271-308 ). Yaj. gives a detailed treatment of 
five kinds of ordeals (II. 95-113 ), while Manu makes only a 
cursory reference to the ordeals of fire and water ( VIII. 1 14 ). Yaj. 



$4. Th$ YHjnavatbjdsmrii lflf 

contains considerable anatomical and medical matter (III. 75-108 ), 
which is wanting in Manu. On the other hand there are some 
subjects on which Yaj. is silent though they are dealt with in detail 
by Manu. This is the case with the account of the origin of the 
world. 

The whole of the Yajnavalkya-smrti is written in the classical 
Anustubh metre. Though the author's great aim has been to be 
concise, his verses are hardly ever obscure. The style is flowing and 
direct. There are not many un-Paginian expressions, though he 
employs * pujya ' in I. 293 and ' dusya ' in II. 296. In the latter 
case both Visvarupa and Apararka avoid the fault by reading 
differently. The verse c kulani jatayah srenyo ' is ungrammatical 
( Tri. ed. II. 34 ), as 'jari', and 'sreni' must be in the accusative 
case. According to the Mit. Yajnavalkya addressed his words 
to Sama£ravas and other sages ( vide com. on I. 1. 178 and 330-333). 
In this the Mit. is probably drawing upon the Bj\ Up. ( III. 1. 2 ) 
where Yaj. asks Samasravas to take away the 1000 cows. 
The sages interpose (vide III. 118, 129) as in Manu, while 
the great teacher is passing in review one topic after another. The 
teacher himself addresses his auditors ( as in I. 178 'srufludhvam'). 

It is said that the sages approached Yajnavalkya in Mithila and 
requested him to impart to them the dharmas of the varnas, 
asramas and others. The contents of the work may be briefly 
summarised as follows :— Ka^da I. fourteen vidyas ; twenty 
expounders of dharma, sources of dharma ; constitution of zparif ad, 
the sathskaras from Garbhadhana to marriage, upanayana, its time 
and other details, every day duties of brahmacari, persons fit to be

Besides the four vedas, Yaj. refers to the Vedartgas as six and 
enumerates fourteen vidyas ( four Vedas, six aflgas, purana, nyaya, 
Mimaihsa, dharmasastra ). He refers to the Aranyaka and Yoga- 
fiastra composed by himself. Aranyakas in general are spoken of in 
I. 145 and Sukriya Aranyaka in III. 309. The Upanisads are 
mentioned in HI. 189, where puranas are mentioned in the plural. 
Itihasas, Purana, Vakovakya, and Narasamsi gathas are mentioned 
in I. 45 ( also I. 101 for purana and itihasa ). He enumerates at 
the commencement nineteen authors on dharma besides himself. 
But it is remarkable that in the body of the work not one individual 
author of a dharma-sastra is mentioned by name. He speaks of 
Anviksiki ( Metaphysics ) and Dandanlti ( I. 3 1 1 ). He lays down 
the dictum that where dharmasastra and artha&stra conflict, the 
former shall prevail ( II. 21 ). He speaks of smjtis in general 
( II. 5 and I. 154 ). In III. 189 he speaks of satras and bhasyas. 
What works are intended it is most difficult to say ; the only extant 
bha§ya which can be said with certainty to be older than the extant 
Yaj. smjti is that of Patanjali. He refers to other writers on dharma 
in the word € eke ' ( I. 36 ). The view referred to there occurs 
in&md.Dh.S. 1. 2. 4.

Yajnavalkya agrees very closely with the VisnudharmasOtra. 
What conclusions are to be drawn therefrom has been discussed 
above (see sec. 10). Similarly there is close correspondence between 
the Kaufiliya and Yaj. If there is any borrowing at all, it must 
follow from the date above assigned to the Kautiliya that it is Yaj, 
who borrows. There are numerous passages in Yaj. that show 
remarkable agreement with the text of Manu. But there are several 
points on which Yaj. differs from Manu and shows in general a 
more advanced state of thought and feeling than the Manusmph 
The following are the principal points wherein Yaj. differs from 
Manu. Manu seems to allow a Brahmana to marry a sudra girl 
(III. 13), while Yaj. emphatically states it as his opinion that this 
is wrong (I. 59) ; Manu first describes the practice of niyoga and 
then severely condemns it (9. 59-68), while Yaj. does not condemn 
it (I. 68-69). Manu enumerates eighteen vyavaharapadas ; Yaj. 
does not expressly enumerate them in one place, though he defines 
vyavaharapada and adds verses of a miscellaneous character 
(prakirnaka) in his section on vyavahara. Manu is silent about the 
rights of inheritance of the widow of a sonless man and gives 
only a vaguely expressed order of succession, while Yaj. places the 
widow at the head of all heirs and enumerates several classes of 
heirs in a regular order. Manu condemns gambling outright 
(9. 224-226), while Yaj. brought it under state control and made it 
a source of revenue to the king (II. 200-203). There are several 
other matters which Yaj. treats at much greater length and more 
systematically than Manu, e. g. ordeals (as indicated above), means 
of proof in courts (Manu altogether ignoring documentary evidence, 
though he knew documents 8. 5 1-52 ), rules of procedure in courts 
(compare Manu 8. 53-56 with Yaj. II. 5-1 1 and 16-21), the 
doctrine of possession and prescription ( Yaj. II. 24-29 and Manu 
9. 44 and 54 ). All these points tend to show that the Yajiiavalkya 
smrti is much later than the extant Manusmrti. 

The Yajnavalkya-smrti seems to have taken the section on 

Vinayaka&nti from the Manavagrhya-sutra ( II. 14 ) ; verses 281- 

283 of Yaj. (I) occur in the Manavagrhya II. 14, but in a different 

order. ' ,6 The Mknavagrhya takes the Vinayakas to be four, while Yaj. 

says that there is a single Vinayaka, whose appellations are Mita. &c.

The details of information about Vinayaka in Yaj. ( I. 272-276 ) 
appear to be versified from the prose* 1 ? of the M. Gr. S. The details of 
worship also and the mantra ( Yaj. I. 291 ) arc taken from the same 
work {vide M. Gr. S. II. 14. 30 for the mantra ). At one time the 
section on Vinayakasanti was thought to be a sure indication of the 
late date of Yaj. But since the discovery of the Manavagrhya that 
position had to be given up. In the Baudhayana-dharmasutra ( II. 
5. 21) we have Vinayaka and his several appellations (in the tarpatja). 
Aparirka on Yaj. I. 275 quotes a long passage from the Baijavapa 
gfhya which bears a very close correspondence in phraseology to the 
passage from the M. Gr. S. quoted above and which gives the names 
of the four Vinayakas as Mita, Sammita, Salakatafikata and Kusmartda* 
rajaputra. 

The Yajnavalkya-smpti stands in a very intimate relation to the 
white Yajurveda and the literature that clusters round it. Most of 
the mantras quoted ( in part ) or referred to by Yaj. occur in the 
Rgveda as well as in the Vajasaneya-samhita ( e. g. in Yaj. I. 22, 24, 
229, 230, 238, 239, 247 ). But there are a few mantras that do not 
occur in the Rgveda, but only in the Vajasaneya-samhita or other 
samhitas ( e. g. 'yavosi' in Yaj. I. 230, which is Vaj. S. 5. 26, 'ye 
samana in Yaj. I. 254 which is Vaj. S. 19. 45, c imam deva' and 
'udbudhyasva* in Yaj. I. 300 which are Vaj. S. 9. 40 and 15. 54, 
'annat parisrutah* and 'kandat' in Yaj. I. 301 which are Vaj. S. 
19* 75 and 13. 20). Verses (Yaj. III. 191-197) are a paraphrase 
of certain passages of the Bj-hadaraiiyaka Upanisad, so much so that 
the very words of the latter are used throughout in the former, as the

quotations given below will show. 518 Then again Yaj. very closely 
agrees with the Paraskaragrhyasutra as was pointed out by Dr. 
Stenzler in his introduction to the edition of Yaj. (1849, Berlin) 
and in the journal of the German Oriental Society (VII. 527). 
ViSvarupa points out that Yaj. I. 142-143 are based upon PSraskara. 
The mantra 'ayarh me vajrah' in Yaj. I. 135 (Trivandrum ed. ) is 
given in Paraskara-grhya II. 7. 7. In the following also there is 
close verbal correspondence 520 between Yaj. and the P. Gr. S ; Yaj. 
III. 1-2 and P.Gr. S. III. 10. 1, 5, 8-9 and 12 ; Yaj. III. 3 and P. Gr. 
S. III. Io. 16 and 19-20 ; Yaj. HI. 4 and P. Gr. S. III. 10. 46-47 ; 
Yaj. III. 16 and P. Gr. S. III. 10. 26-27. Similarly the verses of 
Yaj. on sraddha ( I. 217-270 ) offer many points of contact with the 
Sraddha-kalpa of Katyayana edited by Dr. Caland (pp. 127-130 of 
his work 'Ahnencult &c.' From these facts Dr. Jolly concludes that 
Yajnavalkya's work goes back to a dharmasutra of the White 
Yajurveda ( R. u. S. p. 21). In another place Dr. Jolly hazards 
another conjecture based on the close correspondence 
between Yaj. and the Visnudharmasutra that he pro- 
bably belonged to the Kaihaka sohool of the Black Yajurveda 
(Journal of Indian History, 1924, p. 7). Yaj. also shows great 
similarity to the Kautiliya and borrows the Vinayaka-santi from

the Manavagrhyastitra. From these facts one may argue at least 
with as much logic and force as underlies Dr. Jolly's guess-work 
that Yaj. probably belonged to the Manava school of the Black 
Yajurveda or to the school of Kautilya. If Yaj. knew his business 
as a writer on Dharmasastra, he must have consulted the works of 
his predecessors and his work is bound to show traces of that fact. 
One may conclude at the most that the author of the Yajnavalkya- 
smrti may have possibly been a student of the White Yajurveda and 
so the mantras of the White Yajurveda and the Grhyasutra of 
Paraskara were far more familiar to him than the other Vedas, 
sutras, smjtis, and other works. No such conclusions that there was 
adharmasutra of the White Yajurveda and that the Yajiiavalkyasmrti 
was based thereon are warranted by the facts so far discovered. 

For settling the date of Yaj. we need not consider the evidence 
after the 9th century. For in the first quarter of that century (as we 
shall see later on ) Visvarupa wrote his extensive commentary on 
Yaj. That he was separated from Yaj. by many centuries follows 
from several considerations. Not only had numerous various 
readings arisen in the text of Yaj. when he wrote, but 
various interpretations of the same words and verses of Yaj. had 
arisen. For example, he gives several meanings of the words 
'putronanyasritadravyah' ( in Yaj. II. 47 ), 'samudrah' (II. 41 ) ; he 
gives different interpretations of I. 265, II. 160, II. 173 &c. He 
refers to the interpretations of his predecessors in several places by 
thefword 'anye' (I. 3, 25, 155, 169; II. 21, 119, 121; III. 201,209, 
246 &c). In several places he appears to be referring to two other 
interpretations than his own (vide on III. 250, the words 'kecittu* 
and 'anye tu* and the same words on III. 261 and 264), That 
Visvarupa had before him actual commentaries on Yaj. and was not 
merely giving scholastic interpretations started by himself is made 
very clear in several cases by. his actually citing certain portions from 
those works. On I. 252 Visvarupa says 'others take from somewhere 
the following sloka ( then the sloka is quoted ), but this sloka is of 
no help, as its origin is not known \J" Similar words occur in the 

321 *A 3 ^*f? w** m$ TOfcT-'qr: sfaqfppr W j^r^t wfa[ »

comment'" on Yaj. III. 222. On II. 193 he styles some predecessor 
as 'panditammanya' and on III. 257 he ridicules a predecessor who 
regards the verse of Manu IV. 222 as an arthavada by saying that 
that commentator wanted to show off that he knew the technical 
term arthavada. **' It is not unlikely that Visvarupa in this last 
passage refers to some ancient commentator of Manu such as 
Asahaya. In the Prayascittamayukha,*** Nilakanfha ( Benares edition 
of 1879 ) says that Saiikara in his Bhasya on Brahmasutra (III. 4. 
43 ) explained the application of Yaj. III. 226. Unfortunately in the 
printed editions of Sankara I could not find this. But from the 
Bhamati where Yaj. III. 226 is explained, it is clear that the passage 
must have occurred in the text of Saftkara used by the Bhamati. Dr. 
Jolly lays great emphasis in assigning a late date to Yaj. on the fact 
that Kumarila, who cites Manu, Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhayana 
frequently, ignores the Yajnavalkya-smrti altogether. But this 
silence of the great mimamsaka can only mean that he did not assign 
the same pre-eminent and venerable position to Yaj. that he assigned 
to Manu, Gautama and others. Dr. Jolly himself is prepared to 
place Yaj. three or four centuries earlier than Kumarila. It will 
be shown hereafter that Narada and Brhaspati cannot be placed later 
than 500 A. D. and may have flourished two or three centuries 
earlier still. On a comparison of their doctrines with those of Yaj. 
it will have to be conceded that they represent a far greater advance 
in juristic principles and exactitude than Yaj. So the latter cannot 
be placed later than the 3rd century A. D. As Yaj. is shown 
above to have followed the Manusmrti and the Kaufiliya his smfti 
cannot be placed earlier than the first century B. C. We shall not 
be therefore far from the truth if we place his smrti somewhere 
between the first century B. C. and the third century of the 
Christian era. In the Lafikavatarasfttra ( ed. by B. Nanjio, 1923,

context it appears that the author of the smrti is referred to as 
Yajnavalka. 

Dr. Jolly ( R. u. S. p. 21 ) following Dr. Jacobi ( Z D M G 30, 
p. 306) thinks that Yaj. shows an acquaintance with Greek astro- 
logy. Dr. Jacobi's position amounts to this that the naming of the 
week days after the planets was established among the Greeks 
towards the end of the 2nd century A. D. and as the names of the 
week days and the arrangement of the planets in correspondence 
with them was borrowed by the Indians from the Greeks, no Indian 
work which enumerates the week days or arranges the planets in 
the well-known sequence ( of Sun, Moon, Mars &c. ) could have 
been composed before the third century after the Christ. As is very 
often the case with Western Sanskrit scholars in matters of Indian 
chronology, this grand generalisation is based upon very slender 
data. The premises are mere assumptions without hardly any 
evidence worth the name to support them. No one knows exactly 
when the week-days were named and who were the people that 
first employed the current names of the week-days. It is well- 
known that as far back as the days of Herodotus the Egyptians had 
a presiding deity for each day and that in the times of Julius 
Caesar there were days of Saturn (jjuide I. A. vol. 14, p. 1, General 
Cunningham's article for the Indian origin of week-days ). At least 
from the third century B. C, as vouched for by the 13th edict of 
A£oka, India was in close touch with Syria and Egypt, where 
Buddhist missionaries had been sent by Asoka while Amiochus and 
Ptolemy ruled in the twol. countries respectively. Therefore, if 
Indians at all borrowed the week-days and the arrangement of 
planets from foreigners, . there is nothing to prevent us from 
holding that they borrowed i hem from the Egyptians. The earliest 
dated Indian record wherein a week-day is mentioned is the Erao 
Inscription of 484 A. D. (Gupta Inscriptions p. 89) where we have 
" Suraguror divase. " It is to be noticed that Yaj. does not mention 
the week-days. In I. 296 he mentions the nine grahas in order as 
the Sun, the Moon, Mars ( the son of the earth ), Mercury ( the 
son of Soma ), Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu, Ketu. No one can 
gainsay that at least the Sun, the Moon, Brhaspati and Venus were 
known to the Rgvedic India. Brhaspati in the highest heaven is

spoken of in the Rgveda ,a5 and the conjunction of Jupiter and 
Tisya ( constellation of Pusya ) is spoken of in the Tai. 
Brahmana.** 6 We know so very little of the ancient astronomical 
science in ancient India that one must think twice before dogmatis- 
ing. Yaj. nowhere mentions the zodiacal signs ( rasis ) and pro- 
bably did not know them. Not only so, in his day the naksatras 
were still arranged from Krttika to Bharani as was the case in the 
Tai. S. IV. 4. 10. Vide Yaj. I. 268 ( Kfttikadi bharanyantam ). 
We know from Varahamihira that in the 5th century A. D. 
the signs of the zodiac and the arrangement of Naksatras from Asvini 
to Revati were established facts in all parts of India. Therefore Yaj. 
who uses the ancient arrangement of Naksatras cannot be placed so 
late as the 4th century A. D. When Yaj. ( I. 80 ) speaks of 
" susthe indau " we should not, following such commentaries as the 
Mit., connect the words with the signs of the zodiac or the houses 
of the horoscope. Visvarupa does not speak of raits in this 
connection, but of Naksatras only. From very ancient times certain* 
Nak§atras had come to be regarded as auspicious or suitable for par- 
ticular acts. The Tai. >* 7 Br. directs that one should not finish a 
thing or begin to sacrifice on a naksatra with an evil name. The 
same Brahmapa says that ploughing was to be begun on the Maitra 
asterism (Anuradha) and consecration of;fire on the Aditya naksatra. 
Even the Rgveda speaks of auspicious days* 2 * and the Tai. Br. speaks 
of Deva-nakjatras and Punyahas, and says that a daughter should be 
given away in marriage on the Svati naksatra if she was desired to 
be her husband's favourite. 350 Vide Baudhayana Grhya (I. 1) for 
the marriage nak§atras; also Ap. Gr. S. II. 15. 12-14, Gobhila Grhya 
4. 4. 28 and 2. 1. 1. Therefore, when Yaj. speaks of planets being 
badly placed (I. 307), or of Vyatlpata, Gajacchaya and the passing

(sarhkrama) of the Sun (I. 218), we have no right to connect this 
with the raits. In III. 171 and 172 he speaks of only the conjunc- 
tion of planets and of the passage (of them) through tar&s and 
nakfatras. The Baud. Dh. S. II. 5. 23 speaks of the nine grahas in 
the same order as that of Yaj. Therefore there is hardly any 
evidence to show that Yaj. knew more astrology than was current in 
the days of the Brahmanas and the Grhyasfltras. Yaj, ( in II. 
240-241) speaks of the fine to be imposed on those who counter- 
feited " naiiakas " (coins) and on those examiners of "nanakas" 
who falsely declared a good coin to be counterfeited and vice versa. 
Mr. Jayasval ( Calcutta Weekly Notes, vol. 17, p. cnx ) says that 
nanaka is the gold coin of the Kushans bearing the picture of the 
Goddess Nanaia and that the Kushans did not rise to importance 
before 78 A. D. This would place Yaj. after 100 A, D. But it 
must be remembered that this connection between the Goddess 
Nanaia and the word " nanaka " is quite conjectural and that the 
chronology of the Kushans is far from being settled. 

Yaj. speaks of the sight of yellow-robed people as an evil omen 
( I. 273 ), which is probably a reference to the Buddhists ; though 
it has to be remembered that he prescribes old yellow ( ka§aya ) 
robes for his seeker after mokfa (III. 157). He speaks of the 
founding of monasteries of Brahmapas learned in the Vedas (II. 185), 
The philosophical doctrines contained in the third section ( verses 
64-205 ) approach that phase of the Vedanta that was taught by 
Saftkara. Vide particularly III. 67, 69, 109, 119, 125, 140. He 
employs in elucidating the philosophy of atman the well known 
examples of ghatakafo and of the reflection of the Sun in water ( III. 
144 ), of the various ornaments made from gold, of the spider 
spinning webs out of his own body ( both in III. 147 ), of the actor 
representing various parts ( III. 162 ). All these illustrations 
frequently occur in Sankara's- Sarirakabhasya ( e. g. ghatakasa on II. 
1. 14, spider on II. 1. 25 ). All these points, however, are of very 
little use in arriving at a definite age for the smjti of Yaj. The 
foregoing discussion has established that Dr. Jolly's date ( viz. 4th 
century A. D. in R. u. S., p. 21) is much later than the data warrant. 
There is nothing to prevent us from holding that the extant smrti was 
composed during the first two centuries of the Christian era or 
even a little earlier, 



189 Hitionfof Dhatmatottra 

Besides the Yajfiavalkyasmjrti we have to reckon with three 
other works connected with the name of Yajnavalkya, viz. Vrddha 
Yaj., Yoga-Yaj., and Brhad-Yaj. All these three works are 
comparatively ancient. VisvarOpa quotes (vide note 219 above) 
two verses of Vrddha-Yajnavalkya saying that many writers on 
dharma have been born and will be born and enumerating ten such 
writers. The Mit. and Apararka quote Vrddha-Yajnavalkya 
frequently. One quotation cited from Vrddha- Yaj. by Madhava 
refers to the means of proof in case of doubt whether there was a 
partition." 1 So Vrddha-Yaj. wrote also on Vyavahara. Most of 
the quotations occur in the prayascitta section. It is interesting to 
note that one of these quotations in Apararka 332 regards the touch of 
Parasikas as on the same level with that of Capdalas, Mlecchas and 
Bhillas. The Dayabhaga 333 says that Jitendriya cited the words of 
Brhad-Yaj navalkya ( viz. " sodaro nanyamatrjab " ). The Mit. 
cites Brhad- Yajnavalkya on prayascitta. So this also is a work that 
must be held to be earlier than 1000 A. D. Yaj. himself is styled 
Yogisvara by the Mit. and other works, but Yoga-Yajnavalkya is a 
different work from the Yaj. smrti and existed probably prior to the 
latter work. Yaj. (in III. 1 10 ) claims the Yogaiastra to be his own 
work. So either Yaj. the author of the smrti composed such a work 
or the author of the smrti in order to glorify it claimed that he was 
the same as the author of a well-known Yogasastra ascribed to a 
Yajnavalkya. At all events Yoga-Yajnavalkya existed certainly 
much earlier than 800 A. D. Vacaspatimi&a in his commentary 
on the YogasQtrabhasya quotes a half verse from Yogi- Yajnavalkya. "* 
Vacaspati wrote his Nyayasucinibandha in 898 ( of the Vikram era ) 
i. e. 841-42 A. D. Apararka quotes profusely from Yoga- 
Yajnavalkya. One of the quotations ( on III. 198-201 ) is an Arya

(on the duration of a matift"*). The quotations refer to prapayima, 
Gayatri, bathing, tarpaga and jnana. His position is that even a 
householder becomes mukta by performing his duties, by contem- 
plating on atman and by knowledge of the Vedanta, that the highest 
goal is reached by a combination of jnana and karma and that the view 
that mohfa results from knowledge alone is a sign of indolence."' 
The Para&ram&dhaviya quotes a verse from Yogi-Yaj. saying that 
only the Brithmarias can pass through the four aSramas, the Ksatriya 
through three (excluding the last ), the Vaisya through two* and the 
Sudra only through one ( viz. that of householder )."? Kulluka on 
Manu (3. 1) quotes the view of Yogi-Yaj. that Brahmacarya 
extended to twelve years or five for each of the four Vedas." 8 

In the Deccan College Collection there are two mss. of Yogi- 
Yaj iiavalkya (Nos. 91 and 388 of 1899-1915) in twelve chapters 
and about 495 verses. The colophon at the end of the first chapter 
in the latter ms. describes it in the style of the Bhagavadgita."' 
Yajnavalkya is said to have learnt Yogasastra from Brahma and 
expounds it to his wife Gargi. The whole work deals with the 
eight aftgas of yoga, their divisions and subdivisions. Out of the 
several quotations cited above from Yoga-Yaj. only one was 
found in this work. It contains a verse ( I. 68 asfau grasa munch 
proktah &c ) which is practically the same as Baud. Dh. S. II. 7.

22 and another verse (X. 19) which is a quotation from the 
Bhagavatgita.340 There is another ms. (No. 354 of 1875-76) 
in the same collection called Brhad-Yogi-Yajnavalkya-smrti in twelve 
chapters and about 930 verses. Yajnavalkya in Mithila is asked by 
Janaka and the sages and then expounds the following subjects :— 
how mantras are to be studied in connection with metre, deity, sage 
and viniyoga, about oihkara or pranava ; seven Vyahrtis ; Gayatri ; 
nyasa of Gayatri ; sandhyopasana ; snana ; Japa ; pranayama ; 
dhyana ; suryopasthana ; eulogy of yoga ; eulogy of Veda&stra. 

From the above it is clear that Yoga- Yajnavalkya and Bj-had- 
yogi-Yfijnavalkya are entirely different works and that the latter is 
comparatively an early work, as quotations from it are cited by 
Vacaspatimisra (9th century) and Apararka. The latter work con- 
tains numerous quotations from the Bhagavadgita and the Manu- 
smrti and a few from the Yajnavalkyasmrti ( the verse about the 
14 vidyasthanas is the same in both ). So it .must have been 
composed between 200 and 700 A. D. 

There are many commentaries on the Yaj. smrti. Out of these 
those of Visvarupa, Vijnanesvara, Apararka and Sulapani are the 
most famous. For these see sections 60, 70, 79 and 95 below. On ac- 
count of the paramount importance of the Mit. in modern Hindu Law 
as administered by British Courts in the whole of India, the smrti of 
Yaj. has indirectly become the guiding work for the whole of India 
and this position it richly deserves by its concise but clear state- 
ment of principles, its breadth of vision and its comparative impar- 
tiality towards the claims of both sexes and the different varnas. 

35. The Parasara Smrti 

• 

This work has been published several times, but the edition of 
Jivananda ( part 11. pp. 1-52) and that in the Bombay Sanskrit 
Series with the voluminous gloss of the great Madhava are the best 
known. In the following pages Jivananda's edition has been used. 

The smrti of Parasara must have been an ancient one as Yaj. 
(I. 4) mentions him among the ancient writers on dharma. But it 
is doubtful whether we possess the ancient smrti of Para&ra. The 
extant smrti is probably a recast of it as it mentions Yaj. in the first 



it. Th* ParOiarasmrU 1M 

chap. ( p. 2 )• The Garudapurana in chap. 107 gives a summary 
in 39 verses of the Parasara-smrtL In doing so it takes parts of the 
latter and pieces them together. For example, verses 2-.j in the 
Garudapurana ( chap. 107 ) are ' srutih smrtih sadacaro yah kascid 
vedakartrkah I vedah fmrtah brahmanadau dharma Manvadibhih

chap. I. verses 20-21, 23, 25, 27 and vide 39 for verse 4 of the 
Garuda-purana. This establishes that the Garuda regarded the Para- 
sara-smrti authoritative and ancient. There is another problem to be 
considered. Kaufilya mentions six times the views of Parasara or 
the Parasaras on various aspects of politics and state admi- 
nistration. Therefore it appears that there was a work of Parasara 
on politics, in which it is possible that vyavahara also was 
dealt with. 

The extant Parasarasmrti is divided into twelve chapters and 
contains according to the last verse but one 592 verses. It deals 
only with acara and prayascitta. Madhava introduced his dis- 
quisition on vyavahara, which forms about a fourth of his extensive 
gloss, in an indirect way by regarding vyavahara as a part of the 
duties of Ksatriyas on which the Parasarasmrti has something to 
say.** 1 

The name Parasara is an ancient one. In the Tai. Aranyaka 
(I. 1.3. 57) we have a Vyasa Parasarya. In the Vamsa that 
occurs in the Brhadaranyaka we have a Parasarya. The Nirukta

The introductory verses of the snirti say that sages went to 
Vyasaand requested 'him to instruct them in the dharmas and 
conduct beneficial to mankind in the Kali age and that the great 
/Vyasatook them to his father Parasara, son of Sakti, in the 
Badarikasrama, who then propounded the dharmas of the four 
varyas. The first chaptar recites the smrtis then known ( 19 in all ) 
and lays down that in the four ages of Kjta, Trcta, Dvapara, and 
Kali, the dharmas proclaimed by Manu, Gautama, Saftkha-Likhita 
and Parasara were respectively to be the guiding ones. The 
following are briefly the contents of the Parasara smrti :— 

I. Introductory verses ; Parasara imparts to the sages knowledge 
ofdharma; the dharmas of the four yugas; differentiation of the 
four yugas from various points of view; six daily duties, viz. sandhya, 
bath, japa, homa, Vedic study, worship of gods, Vaisvadeva and 
honouring guests, eulogy of honouring guests, the proper means 
of livelihood for Ksatriya, Vaisya and Sudra ; II. duties of house- 
holder ; agriculture ; the five unconscious acts of injury to animal 
life; III. purification from impurity due to birth and death; IV. 
concerning suicide; punishment for wife deserting her husband 
though poor, foolish or diseased; definition and rules about Kunda, 
Golaka, Parivitti, and Parivitta ; remarriage of women ; rewards for 
chaste widows; V. expiation for minor things (such as dog-bite ) ; 
about a Brahmana who has consecrated fires dying on a journey 
or committing suicide ; VI. Expiation for killing various beasts and 
birds, for killing Sudras, artisans, women, VaiSyas, K§atriyas, sinful 
Brahmanas; eulogy of Brahmanas; VII. purifications of various 
articles (such as vessels of wood, metal &c); about a woman in her 
menses ; VIII. Expiations for killing cows and oxen unwittingly in 
various ways; approaching a parisad for expiation, constitution of a 
pari$ad ; praise of learned Brahmanas ; IX. proper thickness of sticks 
for beating cows'and bulls ; expiations for^using thicker sticks and 
injuries to them ; X. other expiations such as candrayapa for inter- 
course with women with whom intercourse is forbidden; the 
expiation called Santapana ; XI. expiation for partaking food from 






S3. The Parasarasmrfi 195 

Opdalas &c. ; rules as to whose food may be taken and whose not ; 
purification of wells &c. when animals fall in them ; XII. bath 
prescribed after evil dreams, vomitting, shaving &c; expiations for 
drinking wine and nasty things through ignorance ; five kinds of 
bath ; when bath at night allowed ; what things should always be kept 
in the house or seen; definition of the unit of ground called 
gocarma ; expiations for the deadly sins of Brahmahatya, drinking 
liquor, theft of gold &c. 

Parasara contains several peculiar views. He speaks of only four 
sons (aurasa, ksetraja, datta and krtrima) though he does not expressly 
oegative a larger number ( chap. ,j p. 14 ). He eulogises the 
practice of Sati ( last two verses of chap. 4 ). The well-known 
verse of Narada (Stripurhsa-yoga 97) "naste mrte &c.'' is read at the 
end as € * patir-anyo na vidyate " (p. 1 5). There are a few verses 
in the Indravajra metre ( c. g. on pp. 11-12 and 36). The Para- 
Sarasmrti quotes the views of several writers on dharma. Manu is 
frequently cited in the words " Manur-abravld. " In the 7th 
chapter alone those words occur four times. *«« None of them 
corresponds exactly with any verse of the Manusmrti. Yet Manu 
V. 133 may be compared with the first two. Besides these, in the 
9th chapter Manu's view is quoted that on killing an animal the 
guilty party should restore a similar one to the owner or its price.* 4 * 
In the 10th he says that according to Manu uncooked food, milk or 
oil brought from a sudra's house and used in cooking in a 
Brahmin's house could be eaten by a Brahmana. This is similar to 
Manu IV. 223. 346 In the 12th chapter Parasara cites the view of 
Manu that a Brahmana fed on food (cooked) from sudras would 
become a vulture for twelve births, a pig for ten and a dog for seven.

There is nothing corresponding to this in Manu. In the 9th Manii 
is spoken of as one who knows all sastras. 54 ? The first verse of 
the 6th chapter says that Manu deals at length with expiation for 
killing animals. ** 8 This is probably a reference to Manu XI. 
I $ i-i^j 1 . Numerous verses in the Para&ra-smjrti are word for word 
the same as those of the Manusmrti. For example, Manu I. 85-86 
occur in the first chapter of Parasara, Manu V. 160 (about a widow 
remaining chaste ) occurs with slight variations in the 4th ; Manu 
XII. 114-115 (about parisad) occur in the 8th chap. (p. 29); 
Manu XI. 212 (about the definition of Santapana) is the same as 
Parasara ( 10th chap. p. 40 ). Several verses are common to 
Baudhayana and Parasara, e. g. Baud. Dh. S. I. 1. 8, 11, 14 occur in 
the eighth chapter of Parts ara (pp. 29, 30 ). The verse " na nari- 
kelair na ca sanabalair " occurring in Parasara (9th chap. p. 35) 
is quoted as Vasisfha's by Haradatta on Gautama (22, 18). 
Parasara is mentioned by name several times (chap. III. 2, p. 8, 
chap. VI. 1. p. 18 and p. 23, chap. VII. i". p. 24, chap. X. 12. p. 38). 
Uianas is cited on p. 49 (chap. 12), Prajapati (in IV. 3. p. 13), 
Saftkha (chap. 4 p. 15 ). Veda, Vedarigas,dharmasastras and smjtis 
are spoken of on p. 23 (6th chap.). In the nth chap. Para&ira 
refers to several Vcdic mantras, most of which occur in the Rgveda, 
but two of them, "tejosi sukram" and "devasya tva" are not found 
in the Rgveda, but in the Vaj. S. ( 22. 1 and 1. 24 respectively). 
Parasara appears to have been a practical man. He exhorts his 
readers to save their bodies first in invasions, journeys, diseases, 
calj^mities and then care for dharma. He recommends the non- 
observance of rules of purity in times of difficulty and adherence to 
the strict rules of dharma when one is at ease. 54 * 

The Mit., Apararka, Sm.rticandrika, Hcmadri and other later 
works quote Parasara very frequently. Most of these are found in 
the extant Parasarasmrti. For example, vide pp. 1169, 1 177, 1180, 
1 191 &c. of Apararka, all of which are traced in Parasara pp. 42, 43, 
42 and 16 respectively. Visvarupa quotes Parasara several times

SB. The ParBiara*mrti 195 

and these quotations can be verified ; e. g. on Yaj. III. 16 the verse 
" anatham " ascribed to Parasara is found in Parasara chap. Ill p. 10 ; 
on Yaj. III. 257 ten verses are cited by Visvarupa from Parasara 
which occur in Parasara with considerable variations (chap. VII. 
pp. 20-21); on Yaj, III. 262 the verse "gavam bandhana" is cited 
from Parasara, which is the first verse of the 8th chapter. There- 
fore it is quite clear that in the first half of the 9th century the 
Parisarasmrti that we have now was considered to be authoritative 
and the work of an ancient sage. It seems to have known a work of 
Manu, as seen above. Therefore it must be assignad to some 
period between the first and the 5th century of our era. In the 
same direction points the fact that the Garudapurana ( chap. 107 ) 
seems to have known the introductory verses of Para&ra and as 
shown above (p. 191 ) combines passages of Parasara in a summary 
of its teachings." The Visnu-dharmottara which is frequently 
quoted by Apararka and other later works cites verses that are 
borrowed from Parasara. For example, chap. 75. 1 of the former 
is the same as a verse of ParaSara. 3 ' 1 

There is an extensive work called Brhat-Parasara-sarhhiti 
(published by Jivananda, part II. pp. 53-309). '* * s divided into 12 
chapters and the last verse says that it contains 3300 verses and that 
Suvrata proclaimed the Sastra imparted by Parasara. The introduc- 
tory verses contain the same story as that in the Para&ira-smrti and 
many of the verses in the first chapter of the two works ( such as 
those about the 19 writers on dharma &c. ) are almost the same in 
both. The total of verses in the printed work comes to about 
3000 and not 3300. It appears that the work is a recast of the 
ParaSarasmjrti made by Suvrata. The subjects of the twelve chapters 
are : — I. Introductory, the proper sphere of Aryas ; summary of

This Bfhat-Parasara contains a considerable number of vtrscs 
mostly in the Indravajra metre and a few in tha Vasantatilaka 
(e.g. p. 134). 

The Bjrhat-Parasara appears to be a late work. It is a recast of 
the Parasara-smrti. It contains the Vinayakaianti as elaborated by 
Yajnavalkya, since it speaks of only one Vinayaka (9th chap. p. 247) 
and not of four as in M. Gr. S. On p. 249 it quotes Yaj. I. 285 
( about the names of Vinayaka ) with the readings found in the Mit. 
It speaks of the rasis ( p. 244 ). It is not quoted by Visvarupa, 
the Mit. or Apararka. ,It is mentioned in Bhattoji's comment on 
the Caturvirhsatimata ( p. 138) and by Nandapandita in the Dattaka- 
mimarhsa, which quotes a verse ( Brhat-ParaSara p. 153 ).' 52 

A Vrddha-Parasara is quoted by Apararka (on Yaj. II. 318) 
immediately after Parasara and as holding a different view. 
Madhava also quotes a Vrddha-Parasara ( Parasara-Madhavlya vol. 1, 
part 1, p. 230 ). This seems to be a different work from the 
Parasara-smrti and the Brhat-Parasara. Hemadri ( Carturvargfc. 
vol. Ill, part 2, p. 48) and Bhatfoji in his gloss on CaturviriiJa* 
timata (p. 138) quote a Jyotih-Parasara. 

36. The Narada-smrti 

There are two versions of Narada on Vyavahara, a smaller and 
a larger one. The smaller version was translated by Dr. Jolly in 
1876 ( Triibner & Cd* London). The text of the longer version 
was published by the same scholar in the Bibliotheca Indica series 
(1885) and was translated by him in the Sacred Books of the East 
Series ( vol. 33 ), The edition of the text is accompanied up to 
verse 21 of the 5 th title ' abhyupetyaSusrusa ' by extracts from the 
commentary of Asahaya as revised bf Kalyanabhatta, who was 
encouraged in the task of revision by Ke&vabhatta. 



86. The N&radasmrti 197 

From verse 22 of the same title the printed text is the same as 
the smaller version. A verse quoted as Narada's by Ksirasvamin is 
not found in the larger version but is found in the smaller version. 353 
An ancient Ms. of Narada from Nepal dated 1407 A. D. contains 
two additional chapters on theft and ordeals. Dr. Jolly includes 
the first as an appendix and omits that on ordeals on the ground 
that it is not authentic. One of the colophons of the Nepalese Ms. 
describes it as c iti Manava-dharmasastre Naradaproktayam saihhi- 
tayam &c ' This corroborates what was said above ( pp. 149, 156) 
as to the close connection between Manu and Narada. 

Narada is not mentioned by Yajnavalkya in the list of ancient 
writers on dharma, nor does Parasara mention him. Visvarfcpa 
however quotes a verse of Vrddha- Yajnavalkya (on Yaj. I. 4-5 ), 
where Narada is the first among ten expounders of dharma enume- 
rated therein ( vide note 219 ). 

The printed Narada contains three introductory chapters on the 
principles of judicial procedure ( Vyavahara-matrka ) and on the 
judicial assembly ( sabha ). Then the following titles of law are 
dealt with one after another : — rnadana ( recovery of debts ), upa- 
nidhi ( deposit, lending, bailment ), sambhuya-samutthana ( part- 
nership ), dattapradanika ( gifts and resumption thereof ), abhyupe- 
tya-asusrusa ( breach of contract of service ), vetanasya-anapa- 
karma ( non-payment of wages ), asvamivikraya ( sale without 
ownership ), vikriyasampradana ( non-delivery after sale ), krita- 
nusaya ( rescission of purchase ), samayasyanapakarma ( violation of 
conventions of corporations, guilds &c. ), slmabandha ( settlement 
of boundaries ) ; stripumsayoga ( marital relation ) ; dayabhaga 
( partition and inheritance ) ; sahasa ( offences in which force is the 
principal element ) such as homicide, robbery, rape &c. ; vakpa- 
rusya ( defamation and abuse ) and dandaparusya ( hurt of various 
kinds ) ; prakirnaka ( miscellaneous wrongs ). The appendix deals 
with theft, though a few remarks are made on that topic under the 
title of c sahasa. ' 

It will be noticed that Narada follows the Manusmrti to a con- 
siderable extent in the nomenclature and the arrangement of the

eighteen titles. Some of the titles are differently named by Narada, 
e. g, he speaks of upanidhi, while Manu employs the word nik§epa. 
Narada seems to have included the svamipalavivada of Manu in 
veianasya-anapakarma. He makes one title of dyuta and sama- 
hyaya. Narada includes strisarhgrahana under sahasa and adds three 
pities, viz. abhyupetya-asusriisa, vikrlyasampradana and prakirnaka. 
The smrticandrika expressly' 5 * says that it follows the work of 
Narada in preference to that of Manu as regards the nomenclature 
and sequence of the titles of law. Narada follows Manu in speaking 
of witnesses in :he section on rnadana and in treating of theft after 
the eighteen titles have been dealt with ( vide Manu IX. 256 ff. ). 

The printed Narada contains 1028 verses ( including 61 on 
theft in the appendix ). About seven hundred of these verses 
occur in various nibamihas as quotations. Up to the 21st verse of 
the section ' abhyupetyasusrusa ' the commentary of Asahaya 
furnishes a valuable check for the authenticity of the text. For the 
remaining portion, there are important data as to its authenticity, 
sequence and readings. Visvariipa, who belongs to the first half of 
the 9th century, quotes about fifty verses of Narada ( generally by 
name ). The text that he had before him was essentially the same 
as that of the printed edition, except in a very few cases. Out of 
the seven verses of Narada on 'samayasya-anapakarma* Visvartipa 
quotes five (on Yaj. II. 190 and 196) and expressly states that 
Narada wound up his chapter on that topic with the verse 'dosavat 
karanam &c\ as the printed text does. On Yaj. II. 226 Visvarupa 
distinctly says that the verse 'yameva hyativarteran' &c. is followed 
immediately by € mala hyete manusyesu \ This is the case with 
the printed text also ( dyutasamahvaya verses 13-14). On Yaj. III. 
252 Visvarupa quotes a verse af Narada about the three kinds of 
wealth, .sukla, sabala and kfsna, which does not occur in that 
form in Narada, though the latter contains similar dicta. 35 5 VisvarQpa 
contains no quotation from Narada on the topics of acara or 
prfiyascitta. The same is the case with Medhatithi and the 
Mitaksara. Medhatithi somewhat inaccurately summarises the

the introductory words ( in prose) of Narada ( vide note 269 above). 
Medhatithi frequently quotes Narada particularly from the sections 
on piadana ( vide on Manu 8. 47, 155, 149) and dayabhaga (on 
Manu 8, 28, 29, and 207, 209, and 143 ). On Manu 8, 349 he 
quotes Narada on partnership (verse 10), on 8. 216 he quotes 
Narada ( vetanasya-anapakarma verse 5 ). In some cases Mcdhatitlri 
cites Narada's verses without naming him c. g. on Manu 9. 76 he\ 
quotes the well-known verse 'nashte mjte pravrajite flee* ( Narada 
on marital relation, verse 97 ) as 'smrtyantara'. It was shown 
above (p. 172) that the vyavahara section of the Agnipurana dates 
from about 900 A, D. Chap. 253 of the Agnipurana contains 
thirty verses of the extant Naradasmrti, viz. Agni 253. ib~9a = 
Narada ( vyavahara-matrka chap. I. 8-15 ); Agni 253. 9b— 12 
= Narada (vyavahara-matrka chap. I. 26-29a ) ; Agni 253. 13-30 
are the verses defining the eighteen titles from rnadana to 
praklrnaha contained in Narada and occur in the same order in both. 
The readings preserved in the Agnipurana deserve some discussion. 
Agni (253. 3-4 ) reads 'dharmas ca vyavaharas ca ... uttzrah purva- 
sadhakah', while Narada has *purvabadhakah\ Agni reads 'caritram 
sariigrahe pflmsam rajajnayarii tu sadhanam' (253. 5), while Xiirada 
has 'caritram pustakarane rajajnayaih tu sasanam 1 . Agni (253. is ) 
reads 'dattvadravyam ca samyag-yaiy, while Narada (dattapradanika 
1 ) reads 'dattva dravyamasamyag-yah\ The Agni (253. 11) reads 
*£aiika sadbhistu samsargat tattvam sodhabhidarsanat' and avoids the 
rare word 'hodhabhi-' in Narada 'Sankiisatam tu sariisargat tattvam 
hodhabhidarsanat' ( Vyavaharamatfka I. 27 ). For N'Arada's 
'aksabradhnaSalakadyair &c.' ( dyutasamahvaya 1 ) Agni reads 
c A^savajra &c.' (253. 29). The Mit. (on Yaj. II. 199 ) and 
Vlr. (p. 718 ) follow printed Narada in the last case 
and also in the other cases. In the Smrti-candrika, 
Hemadri, Parasaramadhaviya and other later nibandhas numerous 
verses of Narada are quoted on topics of acara, sraddha, 
prayakitta. For example, Hemadri ( caturvarga vol. III. part 2, pp. 
*59> J 83, 185, 223, 235) quotes several verses of Narada on 
EkadaSi and a verse of Narada about the astrological yoga called 
padmaka. The Smrticandrika ( I. pp. 198-199) quotes 26 verses 
on the worship of Narayana, the last of which is the well known 
verse 'dhyeyah sada savitrmandala-madhyavarti &c.' and the same 
work (on irftddha p. 354) quotes a verse of Narada in which 
Sunday and Samkrami are mentioned. The question arises whether 



£60 History tf DharmaiUstra 

these!" quotations of Narada on acara and praya&itta and allied topics 
are the work of the same Narada that wrote on Vyayahara. From 
the fact that early writers like VisvarQpa, Medhatithi and 
Yijnanesvara do not contain a single quotation of Narada on topics 
(Sther than that of vyavahara, it appears probable that the quotations 
/ on acara and prayascitta belong to a later date than the Naradasmrti 
on vyavahara and either did not exist in the days of Vtevarupa and 
Medhatithi or had not attained canonical authority in those days. 
There is in the India Office Library a ms. of Naradasmrti in three 
chapters and 322 verses dealing exclusively with acara and 
prayascitta ( vide Jolly's Introduction p. 5 to edition of text ). 

The Naradasmrti, excluding the introductory passage in prose about 
the successive abridgments of the original work of Manu by Narada, 
Markandeya and Sumati Bhargava, is written, in the Sloka metre 
except in the case of two verses ( verse 38 of the 2nd chap, of 
vyavahara-matrka and the last verse of the chapter on sabha). 
Narada himself is mentioned by name in connection with the 
ordeals ( rnadana verse 253 ).*5sa The first person also occurs in 
'atali param pravaksyami' (rnadana 343 ). Acaryas are cited in 
'dattapradanika' ( verse 5 ). Dharmasastra and arthasastra are 
mentioned (vyavaharamatrka, chap. I, 37 and 39 ) and Narada lays 
down the rule as in Yaj. (II. 21 ) that in a conflict between the 
two the former should furnish the rule of conduct.** 6 Narada 
refers to Vasistha's rule about interest ( rnadana 99 ). Two 
verses are quoted from a Purana.*" Manu is named in several places 
( rnadana verses 250, 251, 326 ).*'>* The first passage about Manu 
is quoted by Visvarupa on Yaj. (II. 98) and corresponds closely 
with the teaching of Manu (8. 113). But the other passages

crediting Manu with dividing ordeals into five kinds and giving his 
view about poison ordeal have no corresponding passage in the 
extant Manu. Therefore Narada had a version of Manu before him 
that was somewhat different in certain respects from our Manu or 
Narada may be referring to Vrddha or Brhat Manu. Besides this 
there is one remarkable fact to be noted about the relation of Manu 
and Narada. There are about 50 verses that are common to Manu 
and Narada. Manu 8. 12-14 and 18-19 are Narada (sabha, verses 
8-10 and 12-13 * n a different order), Manu 8. 140-141= N. (pjadana 
99-100 ), Manu 8. 148-149 =N. (rnadana 80-81 ), M. 8. i43=N.(r. 
129, M. 8. 64=N. (r. 177), M. 8. 72=N. (r. 189), M. 8. 93 and 113 
s=N.(r. 199, 20i),M.*;98-99=N. (r. 208, 209andUdyogaparva 35.33- 
34 ), M. 8. 89=N. (r. 225), M. 8. 186-187, 189, 191= N.(upanidhi 
10-13), M. 8. 232-233, 235 = N. ( vetanasya-anapakarma 14-16 
in a different order ), M. 9. 47 =N. (marital relation, verse 28), 
M. 8, 224-225= N. (marital relation, 33-34), M. 9. 357-358=^ 
( marital relation, 65-66 in reverse order), M. 9. 3 =N. ( dayabhaga 
31), M. 9. 216 = N. (dayabhaga 44), M. 8. 267-269 = N. 
(vakparu§ya 15-17), M. 9. 270-272= N. (vakparusya 22-24), 
M. 8. 281-284 aa N. ( daijda-parusya 26-29), M. 4. 87 =N. 
( prakirnaka 44 ). 

Narada ( rnadana 158 ) 'srotriyas-tapasa vrddha ye ca pravrajita 
narab I asaksinas-te vacanan natra heturudalmah' has probably Manu 
8. C$ in view where we read 'na saksi . . . na srotriyo na liAgastho 
na saftgebhyo vinirgataV- 

Besides these there are several cases where Narada closely agrees 
with Manu though the verses are not identical, e. g. Narada 
( sahasa 19 ) may be compared with Manu 9. 271 and Narada 
(appendix on theft, verses 1-4) may be compared with Manu 
( 9. 256-260 ). These facts establish that Narada is based on a 
version of Manu that was essentially the same as the extant text of 
Manu, though there was some difference here and there. Narada 
contains several verses that occur in the Mahabharata. For example, 
Santi in. 66 = N. ( vyavahara-matrka 72 ),»* Udyoga 35. 
58 = N. ( sabha, verse 18 ), Udyoga 35. 31-32 = N. ( r- 202-203). 
There are several cases where the text of Kautflya agrees with 

m. d. 26. 



262 History of Dharmaittitm 

Narada.* 60 In some of these cases the agreement is almost word 
for f word.' 61 

Though Narada is based on Manu, he differs in several essential 
matters from Manu. We have seen the difference between them 
in the nomenclature of the titles of law. Manu only casually 
mentions the ordeals of fire and water (8. 114), while Narada 
enumerates five kinds of ordeals, describes them at length and adds 
two more viz. taydula-bhakfatja and taptamdja ( r^adana, verses 
259-348 ). He allows Niyoga ( marital relation, verses 80-88 ), 
while Manu strongly condemns it. He allows remarriage of women 
( Narada, marital relation, 97 ), while Manu is against it. Manu 
mentions seven kinds of slaves ( 8. 415 ), while Narada raises their 
number to fifteen ( abhupetyasusrusa, verses 26-28 ) ; Manu con- 
demns gambling outright (9. 221-228), while Narada allows it 
under state control and as a source of revenue ; Narada is further 
far more systematic than Manu and is full of divisions and subdivi- 
sions. For example, he divides property into three kinds, each of 
which is again subdivided into seven varieties ( rnadana 44-47 ) ; 
Narada divides the law of gift into four sections, which are further 
subdivided into 32; he subdivides the eighteen titles into 132 
( vyavahara-matrka I. 25 ). 

There are a few points which are almost peculiar to Narada, 
such as the fourteen kinds of impotent persons (stripumsayoga 11-13), 
the three kinds of punarbhns and four kinds of svairipis ( ibid. 
verses 45-52 ). 

Narada is probably later than Yajnavalkya. Yaj. knows only 
five kinds of ordeals, while Narada knows seven and the former's 
treatment of them is not so exhaustive as Narada's. The rules of 
judicial procedure in Narada are more systematic and exhaustive 
than those of Yaj. Narada contains more definitions than Yaj. In 
some respects however Narada is more conservative than Yaj. For 
example, Narada nowhere recognises the rights of the widow to

succeed to her deceased husband as Yaj. does; Narada gives no rules 
about the succession of gotrajas and bandhus as Yaj. does. In a few 
respects Narada agrees with the views of Manu instead of with Yaj., 
such as allowing a Brahmana to marry a £udra woman. Narada 
regards sexual intercourse with a pravrajita ( female ascetic ) as k, 
mortal sin ( stripumsayoga 74-75 ), while both Manu ( 8. 363 ) 
and Yaj. ( II. 293 ) treat it lightly. Taking ail these things into 
consideration it may be said that Narada flourished nearly at the 
same time as or somewhat later than Yaj. 

Narada contains several rare words such as " hodha " ( in 
vyavaharamatrka 1. 27, meaning 'one's property when lost or stolen'). 
He gives expression to certain principles of law and politics, such 
as that a man is master of his own house, in other words, a man's 
house is his castle ;* 6a he highly eulogises the office of king, almost 
assigning it a divine origin and exhorts the people to obey and 
honour even a weak and undeserving king.* 6 * Mr. Jayasval sees in 
this and in the fact that Narada speaks of dinara while the Mrccha- 
katika speaks of nanaka indications that Narada belongs to the fourth 
century, is later than the drama, is propping up the authority of a 
new dynasty and flourished under the Imperial Guptas ( C. W. N. 
vol. 17, p. cclxxxv ). He regards a person as minor till the 
sixteenth year.* 6 * This limit was probably first fixed by Narada. 
Narada further boldly says that in case of conflict between dharmu- 
idftra and usages, the latter have to be followed, as they are directly 
observed.* 6 * 

As Narada's is regarded as an authoritative smrti by Visvarupa, 
Medhatithi and other later writers and as Asahaya, who is mentioned 
by name in the commentary of VisvarOpa, wrote a comment on

t04 History oj Dkarmaifolra 

Narada, the Naradasmrti must be older by some centuries than the 
8th ; century, the latest date to which Asahaya can be assigned. 
Baha in his Kadambari compares the royal palace to Naradiya.* 6 * 
Ordinarily Naradiya standing by itself would denote the Narada- 
purana (compare Visnu-purana 3. 6. 21 where we have the form 
Naradiya for the purana ). The Narada-purana ( Venkatesvara 
Press edition, Bombay ) contains, however, no treatment of raja- 
dharma. Bana may have intended a violent pun, meaning 'the palace 
where the duties of kings were being expounded ( avarnyamana ), 
like the Naradiya in which rajadharma has not been set forth 
(avarnyamana).' European scholars like Dr. Jolly and BQhler hold that 
Bana refers to the extant Naradasmrti- But on this explanation also 
the difficulty is not entirely got over. The extant Narada can 
hardly be described as a treatise on rajadharma. It deals only in an 
indirect way with one aspect of the king's duties and is rather con- 
cerned with vyavahara and the duties of the subjects towards each 
other from the strictly legal point of view. If we turn to the Maha- 
bharata and other works, we shall find that rajadharma meant some- 
thing different from what is treated of in the Naradasmrti. There- 
fore Bana's reference to the Naradiya is of a doubtful character. 
The Rajaniti-ratnakara of Candesvara frequently quotes Narada on 
politics ( pp. 3, 13, 79). These quotations are not traced in the 
printed Narada. Therefore it is highly probable that Bana refers 
to a distinct work of Narada on politics which has not yet been 
recovered. 

The Vyavaharamatrka of Jimfltavahana and the ParaSara-Madha- 
viya ( vol. Ill, part I, p. 203 ) quote a verse from Narada, the 
latter half of which is the same as the latter half of a verse in the 
Vikramorvasiya.* 6 ? The doctrine attributed to Narada is found in 
Yaj. (II. 20 ) and the Visnudharmasutra, ( 6. 22 ) but not in the 
same words. Unfortunately the date of Kalidasa is far from being 
universally accepted, but the fourth or first half of the 5th century 
is often accepted as the probable date. There is further diffi-

culty in the fact that the text of the Vikramorva&ya has been largely 
tampered with. If the verse is a genuine part of the drama, it seems 
natural to suppose that Kalidasa turns a well-known legal maxim 
to a somewhat humerous use. It is hard to suppose that Narad* 
would borrow the words of a dramatist for setting forth a Iegal'\ 
maxim. This would pushJNback the date of Narada far beyond the 
5th century. Narada in two places uses the word " dinara ", once 
in the sense of a golden ornament and again as a coin or unit of 
value also called " suvarna. " In this last case he says that " dinara 
is equal to 48 Karsapanas or twelve dhanakas. " Jolly ( R. u, S. 
p. 23 ) thinks that Indian din&ras can scarcely be older than the 2nd 
century A. D., although in the times of the Indo-Scythian kings 
coins of the weight of dinara occur. Therefore Jolly is of opinion 
that Narada is later than 300 A. D. Winternitz ( History of Indian 
Literature, vol. II. p. 216 n. 4 ) follows him in this assumption 
that all Sanskrit works in which the word dln&ra occurs must be 
later than the 2nd or 3rd century A. D. It may be that the golden 
dfnaras most numerously found in India belong to the 2nd and 3rd 
centuries A. D. But as Keith points out ( J. R. A. S. 1915 p. 504) 
Jolly's assumption is wrong and the introduction of din&ras into 
India need not be later than the beginning of the Christian era. 
Golden din&ras were first coined in Rome in 207 B.C. and the oldest 
Indian pieces corresponding in weight to the Roman Denarius were 
struck by Indo-Scythian kings who reigned from the first century 
B. C. ( W. B. p. 44 ). Therefore there is nothing to prevent us 
from holding that Narada flourished in the first centuries of the 
Christian era, i. e. between 100 and 300 A. D. Mr. Jayasval assigns 
him to the 4th century A. D. and after the Mjrcchakatika. Most 
scholars would not be prepared to assign to the Mrcchakatika so 
early a date as the 3rd century A. D. Besides Mr. Jayasval builds his 
theory on very slender foundations. Because the drama employs 
the word nanaka and Narada speaks of dinara only, no chronological 
conclusion as to the priority of the one to the other can be drawn. 
After both words became current in the language, one author, though 
later, may employ one word, while another, though earlier, may 
employ the other.

It is difficult to say anything as to the home of Narada. In the 
appendix on theft Narada in one place says that in the south a 
silver karsapana is current, that in the east it is equal to twenty 
papas and that he does not follow the standard of karsapana current 
jm the land of the five rivers.* 6 * From these data and from the fact 
that the oldest mss. of Narada come fr^n Nepal and that an old 
commentary on Narada in Newari was composed in Nepal, Dr. Jolly 
conjectures that Narada's home was to be sought in Nepal. This is 
all pure guess-work. There is no reason why Narada could not 
have hailed from central India. The places where the oldest and 
best mss. of a work are found can hardly ever be indications of the 
original home of an ancient author. Bhamaha is by common 
consent a Kashmirian writer on Poetics, but the only mss. of- his 
work so far found come from southern India. 

Prof. Dr. Bhandarkar (Carmichael Lectures 1918, p. 90), probably 
following the Najacandrika, hazards the conjecture that the writer 
called Pisuna cited in the Kaufiliya is another name of Narada. 
Beyond the bare fact that Narada is often credited in the puraoas 
with the role of instigating feuds and quarrels and that the word 
pisuna means "wicked, back-biter", there is nothing to support this 
identification. 

A Jyotir-Narada is quoted by Bhattoji in his commentary on the 
Caturviriisatimata ( p. 11 ). A Brhan-Narada is quoted by 
Raghunandana and a Laghu-Narada in the Nirnayasindhu and the 
Saihskara-Kaustubha. 

In the Mahabharata several opinions are attributed to Narada. 
One of them condemns the eating of flesh. 570 The first half of the 
last verse is the same as Manu 5. 52. Narada is credited with having 
divided utpatas (portents) into three varieties." 1 Narada is said to 
have held the view that one must always be active." 2 It appears that 
all these views are taken from some work or works of a Narada.

The first is probably taken from Narada's version of the Manusmjti 
of which the puragas speak as stated above ( note 270 ). 

For Asahaya the commentator of Narada vide section 58 below. 

37. Brhaspati 

Brhaspati as a sQtra writer on politics has been dealt with above 
(section 26). In this section Brhaspati the jurist will be spoken of. 
The complete smrti of Bfhaspati on law has not yet been discovered. 
It will be, when discovered, a very precious monument of ancient 
India, exhibiting the high-water mark of Indian acumen in strictly 
legal principles and definitions. Dr. Fiihrer collected together 84 
verses ascribed to Brhaspati in the legal treatises of Apararka and 
others with German translation and notes (Leipzig, 1879) and 
Dr. Jolly collected about 711 verses of Brhaspati on law and 
translated them in the Sacred Books of the East ( vol. 33 ). 

Yaj. (I. 4-5) enumerates Brhaspati among the writers on 
dharma, but he is probably referring to Brhaspati's work on politics. 
The com. on the Nitivakjamrta ( p. 7 ) quotes the first verse of 
Brhaspati's Nitisastra. 

We saw above how Brhaspati closely follows the extant Manu- 
smrti, how he pointedly refers to the text of Manu (notes 282-286) 
and therefore might by analogy be styled a vartikakara of Manu. In 
many places Brhaspati explains and illustrates the laconic treatment of 
Manu. Manu (8. 153) speaks of four varities of interest ( Cakra, 
Kala, Karita, and Kayika), but does not explain these terms. 
Brhaspati explains them clearly."* Manu ( 8. 49 ) enumerates five 
modes of recovering a debt (dharma, vyavahara, chala, acarita, 
bala ) but leaves them unexplained ; Brhaspati devotes several verses 
to the explanation of these terms ( vide Kulluka on Manu 8. 49 ). 
Brhaspati gives elaborate rules regarding partnership. Brhaspati 
enumerates nine ordeals (of fire, water, poison, balance, kosa, 
taptamasa, taodulas, dharmadhafma, phala); while Manu barely 
alludes to two. Manu devotes only three verses to sariividvyatikrama 
( 8. 219-221 ), but Brhaspati must have devoted at least a score of 
verses to this topic, as Apararka alone quotes 17 verses of Brhaspati 
on this title.

*08 History tt Dharmafatra 

The order in which the topics of law appeared in Brhaspati can 
be settled with tolerable certainty from the quotations in Apararka, 
Vivadaratnakara, Viramitrodaya and others works. It was as 
follows :— the four stages of a law-suit, proof (kriya, human of three 
sorts and divine), witnesses (of 12 kinds), documents (ten kinds), 
bhukti ( possession ), ordeals ( nine ), 18 titles, r^adana, nik§epa, 
asvamivikraya, sariibhuya-samutthana, dattapradanika, abhyupetya- 
Susrusa, vetanasya-anapakarma, svamipalavivada, samvid-vyatikrama, 
vikriyasariipradana, simavivada, parusya ( of two kinds ), sahasa ( of 
three kinds ), strisamgrahana, stripuriidharma, vibhaga, dyuta, 
samahvaya, prakirpaka ( otherwise called c nrpaSraya vyavahara, ' 
wrongs for which proceedings are set on foot by the king ). 

Brhaspati was probably the first jurist to make a clear distinction 
between civil and criminal justice. "4 He divided the eighteen 
titles into two groups, those springing from wealth ( 14 titles ) and 
those springing from injury to beings ( 4 titles ). This distinction 
was probably dimly perceived by even Gautama, when he says 
that in disputes based on injury there is no hard and fast rule about 
witnesses (i.e. about their interest in the subject of dispute)."* 
Brhaspati like Narada lays down the rule that a legal decision should 
not be arrived at merely on the basis of iastra and that when a 
decision is devoid of reasoning, there is loss of dharma, for even 
a good man may be held to be a bad one or what is good may be 
held to be sinful in a judicial proceeding, just as Mandavya was 
held to be a thief on a decision without thoughtful reasoning." 6 
Brhaspati gives such elaborate definitions and rules about procedure 
from the filing of the plaint to the passing of the decree that he 
can very well stand comparison with modern legislators on the 
same subjects.

&7. JBfhaspati $0$ 

Narada and Brhaspati agree very closely in several respects. 
For example, both speak of three kinds of proof, four parts of a 
judicial proceeding, almost the same defects of plaints, four kinds 
of answer, four divisions of the law of gift and their subdivisions, 
five modes of recovering debts, four kinds of sahasa. 

We have seen that Narada departs from Manu in several essen- 
tial matters. On the other hand Brhaspati follows Manu very closely. 
But he too differs on some points from Manu,. for example, we saw 
above how Brhaspati dissents from Manu on the question of the divi- 
sibility of clothes &c. (note 285). He appears to differ from Manu 
as to the maximum interest allowed on corn, fruit, wool and beasts 
of burden. "7 Manu and Narada are both silent as to the widow's 
right to succeed to her deceased husband's estate. But Brhaspati 
agreeing with Yajnavalkya makes her the first heir of her sonless 
husband." 8 

These considerations make it clear that Brhaspati is certainly 
later than Manu and Yaj. It is difficult to state his exact relation- 
ship to Narada. He agrees more closely with Manu than Narada 
does, but in some respects such as definitions and the rights of 
women he shows great advance over Narada. So he is probably 
a contemporary of or not much later than Narada. He employs 
the word napaka.*™ He defines a dinara, also called " suvarpa ", as 
equal to twelve dhanakas and says that a dhanaka was equal to four 
aodikas, an aodika being a copper pana weighing a kar$a and bear- 
ing a stamp.* 80 This agrees with what Narada says about dinara.

ilO History qf Dharmafastra 

Dr. Jolly ( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 276) assigns Brhaspati to the 6th or 
7th century A. D. But this is much later by several centuries than 
yhe evidence warrants. Katyayana was looked upon as an authori- 
tative writer along with Narada and Brhaspati by Visvarttpa and 
Medhatithi. This position he could not have attained in a century 
or two. So he cannot be placed later than the 6th century . 
Katyayana in several places quotes Bjrhaspati as an authority. 
Apararka quotes Katyayana as saying that according to Brhaspati 
pastures, ways, clothes that are worn on the body, debts ( or books 
for use according to others ) and what is set apart for religious 
purposes should not be partitioned. 381 Katyayana says that accord- 
ing to Brhaspati, that wealth which a man acquires by means of his 
learning after refuting an opponent in a contest with a stake for the 
winner is styled " vidyadhana " and is not liable to partition 382 ; 
and what is acquired through valour &c. by persons that were 
taught in the family or learnt under their father should be parti- 
tioned among the brothers, according to Brhaspati. If a man falsely 
denies his liability and if only a part of the claim is brought home 
to him, then he should be made to pay the whole. 383 That the 
statement of a witness may be relied upon on a matter under his 
direct perception owing to his being near the plaintiff and the defen- 
dant and not otherwise; so says Brhaspati. 38 * The foregoing 
examples show that Katyayana looked upon Bjrhaspati as an autho- 
rity who must therefore have flourished several centuries before. 
Therefore B rhaspa ti cannot b e placed later than the 4th centu ry a. d^ 
As he knew the extant Manusmrti, was later than Yaj. and probably 
than Narada, Brhasp ati must have flourished between 200 and 400 a . d. 
This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that Visvarupa quotes, 
without making any difference, prose and verse passages of 
Brhaspati and thereby shows that in his opinion the jurist Brhaspati

( in verse ) was identical with the political writer Brhaspati and 
was a very ancient writer in his day. Medhatithi (on Manu 9. 153) 
quotes the verse " na pratigrahabhur " ( ascribed to Brhaspati by 
others) as Smrtyantara. Brhaspati is cited in a few cases as 
referring to his own views in the third person* 8 * ; some- 
times he uses the first person also.* 86 Nothing can be said 
about his country at present. In a well-known passage Brhaspati 
refers to the usages of the southern people, of the people in the 
Madhyadela, of the eastern and northern people. & In a striking 
and beautiful passage Brhaspati compares vyavahara with yajna,* 88 
the king with Visou, the successful party with the sacrificer and 
the defeated party with the victim, the plaint and the reply 
to food and the pratijna to the sacrificial offering ( prepared 
from food ), the sastras to the three Vedas and the sabhyas to the 
priests in a sacrifice. Brhaspati seems to have been\ery fond of 
such long-drawn metaphors. *** 

The Smrticandrika quotes about seventy verses of Brhaspati in 
the Ahnika portion and about forty on Sraddha. In the later works 
like the Parasara-Madhaviya^ the Nirnayasindhu and Samskara- 
Kaustubha, the number of verses quoted from Brhaspati is much 
larger than even those quoted by the Smrticandrika. Those verses 
are quoted on such samskaras as puriisavana, namakarana, caula, 
upanayana, vivaha and also on asauca and purification of dravyas. 
Even the Mitaksara quotes several verses of Brhaspati on matters

other than vyavahara. For example the Mit. on Yaj. I. aio quot<* 
a verse of Brhaspati that a nivartana ( of land ) is equal to 30 
dandas in area ( danda being seven cubits in length ) and tea 
nivartanas are equal to a gocarma.* 90 On Yaj. III. 17 the Mit. 
quotes two verses of Brhaspati about impurity on birth or death &c. 
On Yaj. III. 21 the Mit, cites the definition of de&ntara given by 
Brhaspati."* On Yaj. HI. 24 the Mit. quotes Brhaspati's opinion that 
the period of mourning on the death of one's maternal grandfather, 
acarya or srotriya is three days. On Yaj. IIL 253 the Mit. quotes 
Brhaspati's rule as to prftyascitta for consciously drinking wihe.'jjj 
Vide also Mit. on Yaj. III. 30, 250, 254, 260, 290 for othex 
quotations from Brhaspati. 

The foregoing therefore establishes that Brhaspati was known at 
least to the Miwand later writers as an expounder in verse not only 
of vyavahara but also of other topics of dharma as well. As over 
a thousand verses of Brhaspati ( including about 800 on vyavahara ) 
are quoted it appears that his work must have been an extensive one 
comprising several thousand verses. Su ch a w ork of Brhaspati has 
yet to be re covere d. 

The Mit, on Yaj. III. 261 quotes a Vrddha-Brtiaspati on the nine 
varieties of samkara. 39 j Kulluka on Manu ( 9. 181) cites a verse 
of Vrddha-Brhaspati about the eleven subsidiary sons (vide note 
283 above, where the verse is ascribed to Brhaspati ). Hemadri 
( Caturvarga vol. Ill, part 2, p. 472 ) quotes a Jyotir-Brhaspati on 
the prohibition of a £raddha on the thirteenth tithi of the dark half. 
Apararka on Yaj. II. 3-4 quotes three verses from Vrddha-Brhaspati

about the derivation of the word "pr&4-viv&ka" and one on the 
punishment for sabhyas who take bribes. Three of these verses 
are ascribed to Brhaspati in the Para&tra-Madhavlya and other works 
and one of them to Katyayana in the Vyavahara-matrka. 

38, Katyayana 

Narada, Brhaspati and Katyayana form a triumvirate in the 
realm of the ancient Hindu Law and procedure. The work of 
Katyayana on vyavahara, like that of Brhaspati, has yet to be 
recovered* The following account is based on the quotations from 
Katyayana contained in about a dozen works from Viivarflpa to the 
Viramitrodaya. 

Katyayana is enumerated as one of the expounders of dharma by 
Sartkha-Likhita, Yajnavalkya ( I. 4-5 ) and Parafer* . A Katya. is 
quoted as an authority in the Baudhayanadharmasutra ( I. 2. 47 ). 
A Srautasutra and Sraddhakalpa of the white Yajurveda are ascribed 
to Katyayana. 

Katyayana appears to have taken Narada and Brhaspati as his 
models in the order and treatment of the subjects to be dealt with 
in vyavahara. He closely follows both the writers in terminology 
and technique. On several points he presupposes Narada and 
expounds and elucidates the latter's dicta. For example, Narada 
( Intro, chap. I. 10-11 ) lays down that vyavahara has four padas, 
each later one prevailing over the preceding, viz. dharma, vyavahara, 
caritra, rajaiasana (note 361 ) and then Narada very briefly in one 
verse explains these four terms. Katyayana on the other hand 
devotes at least nine verses to the elucidation of the rule as to each 
succeeding one prevailing over its predecessor.*** Narada contains 
very little on the topic of stridhana ( dayabhaga chap, verses 8-9 )• 
He merely enumerates the six lunds of stridhana and then lays down 
the rule of succession. Katyayana's treatment of stridhana has 
attained classical rank. It appears that he was probably the first to 
carefully define the several kinds of stridhana ( such as adhyagni, 
adhyavahanika, pritidatta, iulka, anvadheya, saudayika), to lay 
down woman's power of disposal over the several varieties of stri- 
dhana and to prescribe lines of devolution a$ to stridhana. The 
verses on this topic occurring in the nibandhas number about thirty. 

9H Vidt ^ m B vol III, pari I f pp. M-17, and ^0 p. WO. 1KMI*. 



814 History qf Dharmatbtra 

The leading nibandhas contain only a few quotations from 
Brhaspati on stridhana. Hence it may be surmised that Katyayana 
probably was the first smrti writer to give elaborate rules on this 
fbpic. 

' It has been already shown (notes 381-384) how Katyayana often 
quotes the views of Brhaspati. A few more examples may be added 
here. According to Brhaspati, says Katyayana, when a man who 
stands surety with others on a joint liability goes abroad, his son 
would have to pay the whole debt, but if the man dies then the 
son would be liable for his father's share only."* When cattle stray 
into fields, gardens, houses or cowpens, they may be, according to 
Brhaspati, caught hold of (by the ear &c. ) or beaten.*** 
According to Brhaspati, a man of the ksatriya, vai£ya or sudra caste 
may employ one of his own caste to do the work of a dasa ( slave or 
serif ), but even a Brahmana could never employ another Brahmaga 
in the same way.^7 

About a dozen nibandhas on vyavahara quote about 900 verses 
of Katyayana on vyavahara, the Smrticandrika alone citing about 
600 of them. In these verses Katyayana refers at least a score of 
times to the views of Bhrgu. It is remarkable that only a few of 
the views ascribed to Bhrgu are found in the extant Manusmrti. 
Katyayana says, according to Bhrgu, whatever ( ancestral ) wealth 
was concealed by one coparcener from others, whatever was badly 
divided should be divided in equal shares when afterwards 
discovered ( Parasara-Madhaviya III, p. 566 ). This may 
well be compared with Manu 9. 215. Katyayana says 
according to Bhrgu, it is not Brahniana-murder to kill an atatayin 
who is foremost by his austerities, learning and caste. This has in 
view Manu 8. 360. Kulluka distinctly says that Katyayana simply 
explains the verse of Manu by referring to it as Bhrgu's. On the 
other hand there are several places where the views ascribed to 
Bhrgu find no counterpart in the extant Manu. According to 

395 ^ffraniqSr ^ 5W§ ^^ 5 H: ' ?* ^^ ^W *w «r f|*ifa: 11 
ft.T.p- 241 - "• 



&8. tbttyllyam 215 

Bhrgu in all sabasas of the worst type the truth should be found 
out by means of divine proof ( ordeals &c. ) even though there may 
be witnesses." 8 There is nothing in the Manusmrti corresponding 
with this. According to Bhrgu the ordeals of balance &c. are pres- 
cribed for those who are suspected to be in league with marauders\ 
and who have incurred popular censure, but in such cases there is 
no undertaking ( by the complainant to pay fine ). w The Manu- 
smrti has not a word on this point. Household paraphernalia, 
beasts of burden, cattle, ornaments, slaves should be divided when 
discovered ; if they are ( alleged to be ) concealed, the ordeal of 
kosa should be resorted to ; so says Bhrgu .4°° Another important 
circumstance deserves to be noted. Katyayana several times refers 
to the views of Manu. Katyayana says that the view of Manu was 
that in certain charges (such as the commission of mahapatakas) the 
ordeals for the accused were to be performed by good men. 401 
According to Manu if a woman deserted her son, though he may be 
able ( to pay ), her stridhana should be seized and the paternal debt 
should be paid thereout. 402 Manu declared, says Katyayana, that 
if animals be killed, the offender should offer ( to the owner ) 
another similar animal or its proper price (note 345 above 
where Parasara also quotes it as Manu's view ). All these 
views attributed to Manu by Katyayana are not found in the extant 
Manusmrti. In certain places Katyayana refers to the views of the 
Manavas ; e. g. according to the Gargiyas and Manavas if a bribe 
had already been paid, the person receiving it should be made to 
repay it and should be fined eleven times as much ; 4 °* according to

the Manavas thieves caught red-handed with their booty should be 
at once banished. 404 As regards both these references, the teaching 
6f the Manusmrti seems to be different ; vide Manu 9. 231 and 270 
Respectively. These facts about Katytyana's references to Bhrgu and 
Manu raise several difficult questions, whether Bhrgu and Manu 
stand for two entirely different works or for the same work 
and jwhether he refers to some other version of the Manusmrti 
ascribed to Bhrgu. In my opinion he is not referring to two 
separate works, and that he had before him a version of the Manu- 
smrti promulgated by Bhrgu but somewhat different from and 
probably larger than the present Manusmrti. 

In the nibandhas several verses are ascribed to Katyayana along 
with Manu, Yajnavalkya and Brhaspati. For example, the well- 
known verse about the sixfold division of stridhana ( adhyagnya- 
dhyavahanikam &c. ) is ascribed by the Dayabhaga to Manu and 
Katyayana. The half-verse "vanpanamanulomyena dasyam na 
pratilomatafr" is the same in both Yajnavalkya (II. 183) and 
Katyayana. The Viramitrodaya ( p. 140 ) ascribes a verse to 
Brhaspati and Katyayana, in which the opinion of Brhaspati is cited. 
There is very close agreement between the definitions proposed by 
the two last writers of dharma, vyavahara, caritra, and raja&sana. 
Besides Manu (or Manavas), Brhaspati and Bhrgu, Katyayana cites the 
views of several other writers on dharma. For Gargyas and 
Gautama vide notes 403 and 404 above. He says, according to Kausika, 
powerful robbers were to be guarded by chains of iron, were to be 
low-fed and were to undergo hard labour for the state till death 
( Apararka p. 849 ). He quotes the view of Likhita that where a 
woman is deprived of food, raiment and dwelling (\>y Viet husband's 
coparceners') she would be entitled to demand her own ( stridhana 4 ) 
and a share from the coparceners. In one case (Apararka p. 755 ). 
a verse is cited as Katyayana's in which Katyayana himself is named 
( Para&tramadhaviya III. p. 235 ). 

Katyayana contains the same advanced views about law and rules 
of procedure as are found in Narada and Brhaspati. He is even in

advance of these two writers in certain matters, such as definitions 
in general and the elaboration of rules about stridhana. He gives 
numerous definitions, such as those of vyavahara, pradvivaka, 
stobhaka, dharmadhikarana, tirita and. anusi§ta, samanta &c. He\ 
seems to have been the first to invent some new terms. For 
example, he defines pascatkara as a judgment given in favour of the 
plaintiff after a hot contest between the plaintiff and the defendant, 
while the term jayapatra is restricted by him to the judgment given 
on admission by the defendant or a judgment dismissing the suit on 
various grounds. 405 He lays down a stringent rule that if a man 
abandons a ground of defence or attack and puts forward a less 
cogent one, he would not be allowed to put forward again the 
stronger ground after a decisive judgment of the court.* 06 This 
resembles the 4th explanation to section 1 1 of the Indian Civil 
Procedure Code ( 1908 ) about res judicata. The verses about 
kar§apapa and dinara quoted above (note 368) from Narada (parisi§ta 
verses 58-60) are ascribed to Katyayana by the Smjticandrika. 

The date of Katyayana can be settled only approximately. He 
is certainly much later than Manu and Yajnavalkya. As shown 
above he presupposes Narada and regarded Bjhaspati as a very 
leading authority on vyavahara. Hence his upper limit is the 3rd 
or 4th century A. D. Visvarfipa quotes eight verses as Katyayana's 
by name (vide on Yaj. II. 5, 6, 47, 63, 281 ) on such topics of 
Vyavahara as the defects of the plaint, the contents of the plaint, the 
liability for the debts of a deceased person, payments of debts ot 
honour (satyamkara), punishment for abortion, grievous hurt and 
homicide of a Brahmana woman. Medhatithi (on Manu 7. 1 ) 
ascribes to Katyayana the rule that in case of conflict between the 
dictates of dharma&stra and artha&stra the king should prefer the 
former. Medhatithi on Manu (VIII. 216) speaks of Katyayana-sQtra, 
appears to quote a portion of it in prose and explains it. 40 ? Medhatithi

says that Katyayana extended the maxim of the trader carrying 
merchandise ( bhandavaha-varjik maxim ) to all similar transactions. 
All known quotations of Katyayana are in verse. When 
Medhatithi speaks of a sutra and quotes a portion of it ( as "va" and 
"iti" after "nivarteta" indicate ) in prose, we must either suppose 
that he is referring to some other work of Katyayana than the one 
in verse from which hundreds of verses are cited by other writers or 
that Katyayana's work on vyavahara also contains some prose 
passages. As hardly any other writer quotes a prose passage of 
Katyayana on vyavahara, the second alternative appears somewhat 
unlikely. Visvarupa and Medhatithi regarded Katyayana as an 
authoritative smrtikara along with Narada and Bjhaspati. This 
position he could not have attained in less than a few hundred 
years. Therefore the lowest limit to which Katyayana can be 
assigned is the 6th century. Hence it may be said that Katyayana 
flourished between the 4th and 6th century A. D. 

The Vyavaharamatrka ( p. 307 ) quotes a Bfhat -Katyayana on 
the question of proof. The Dayabhaga mentions a Vrddha-Katyil- 
yana. The Sarasvativilasa also quotes verses of Vrddha-Katyayana 
on rescission of purchase and other topics (p^32o). In the 
present state of our knowledge it is very difficult to say whether 
these two are different works. The Caturvarga-cintamani ( vol. Ill, 
part 2, p. 657 ) speaks of Upakatyayana. Apararka quotes a verse 
from sloka-Katyayana which is not found in the Karmapradlpa 
( Jivananda's ed. ), but appears to be a summary of a prose passage 
quoted as Katyayana's immediately before by Apararka. 

In Jivananda's collection of smrtis ( part I, pp. 603-644 ) there 
is one of Katyayana in three prapathakas and 29 khapdas and about 
five hundred verses. The same work is printed as Gobhilasmrti 
in the Anandasrama collection ( pp. 49-71 ). It contains also a 
few prose passages in the 12th, 13 th and 14th khandas. The pre- 
vailing metre is Anustubh, a few verses being in the lndravajra 
and other metres. The work is styled the Karmapradlpa of Katya- 
yana. The opening verse justifies this name when it states that like 
a lamp the work will clearly show the mode of performing certain 
rites treated by Gobhila and other rites which are not clearly eluci- 
dated. 408 The contents of this work are briefly as follows : — how 



**. ROtyftyana 21f 

to wear the sacred thread ; sipping water and touching various 
limbs with water ; the worship of Ganesa and fourteen matrs in 
every rite ; kusas ; Sraddha details ; consecration of sacred fires}* 
details about aranis, sruc, sruva ; rules about cleansing the teeth 
and bathing ; sarhdhya ; pranayama, muttering of Vedic mantras ; 
tarpana of gods and manes ; the great daily yajnas ; who is to offer 
Sraddha ; rules about periods of impurity due to death ; duties of 
wife ; iraddhas of various kinds. 

The Karmapradipa mentions by name several authors. It very 
frequently cites the views of Gobhila ( pp. 603, 626, 638 ) and 
Gautama ( pp. 619, 620, 626, 630, 636, 639 ). The Karmapradipa 
as the opening verse says is intimately related to the Gobhila Grhya- 
sfttra. It distinctly says that as Gobhila did not dilate upon the 
details as to time and procedure of goyajna and vajiyajfia, Katyayana 
dilates upon them. This is borne out by the Gobhila grhya-stitra.«°* 
Another 410 passage of Katyayana about the Asfakas is based upon 
the very words of the Gobhila grhya. Frequent reference is made 
to the views of Vasisfha on the worship of Matrs ( p. 605 ), on 
Sraddha (pp. 608, 62$ ). Vide also p. 642 (28. 16). Among 
the other authors named are Narada on the sticks for dantadhavana 
( p. 615 ), Bhargava ( probably Usanas ) on p. 640, Sandilya and 
Saiidilyayana on p. 626. Katyayana is named in several places 
(pp.624, 627, 638) and once the first person is used (as in 
" mamapyetad hrdi sthitam " p. 643 ). The Katyayanasmrti quotes 
the verse of Manu ( III. 70 ) on the five great yajnas. On p. 633 
four verses forming the consolation to be offered to the relatives 
of a person departed are the same as Yaj. (III. 8-1 1) and one 
verse in the same context occurs in the Mahabharata ( Santiparva

37. 31 and other places ).*" On p. 631 Katyayana speaks of Rama 
having performed yajfias taking as his spouse the golden image 
dfSlta. 

The question is: — what is the date of this Katyayanasmrti 
( Karmapradipa ) and whether it is the work of Katyayana the 
great jurist. The Mit. (on Yaj. I. 254 ) quotes a verse as Katyi- 
yana's which occurs in Jivananda's text (p. 624 verse 20); 
similarly the Mit. quotes two verses as Katyayana's ( on Yaj. III. 
247 ) which have a place in the Karmapradipa ( Jivananda p. 634 
verses 4-5 ). Scores of verses cited as Katyayana's by Apararka ( on 
icara and prayascitta ) are found in the Karmapradipa. For example, 
vide Apararka p. 43 ( three verses ) and Karmapradipa ( p. 605, 
1 1 10-12), Apararka p. 51 (three verses about samidh ) and 
Karmapr. ( p. 613, 8. 17-19 ), Apararka p. 135 ( four verses about 
bathing in rivers ) and Karma. ( p. 615, 10. 5-7 and 14 ), Apararka 
p. 532 ( four verses on sraddha in which Katyayana himself is 
cited as an authority ) and Karma. ( p. 624, 16, 16-19 ), Apararka 
p. 872 ( six verses ) and Karma. ( 21. 2-7 p. 632 ), Apararka p. 1066 
( three verses about an agnihotrin being guilty of mahapataka ) and 
Karma. ( 23. 4-6 p. 634 ). The Smrticandrika also quotes profuse- 
ly from Katyayana on Ocdra, Sraddha etc. and cites from the Karma- 
pradipa by name passages which occur in Jivananda's edition. The 
above references show that in the eyes of the Mitaksara and Apararka 
the Karmapradipa was an authoritative work. Therefore it follows 
that it must have been composed centuries before the nth century 
A. D. It is however remarkable that several quotations ascribed to 
Katyayana in the Mitaksara, Apararka and other works are not 
found in the Karmapradipa. For example, the Mitaksara ( on Yaj. 
III. 242 ) cites Katyayana's verse about five varieties of lapses in 
conduct viz. mahapataka, atipataka, pataka, prasafigika, upapataka and 
on Yaj. III. 260 quotes a verse of Katyayana about what are 
atipatakas. These are not to be traced in the Karmapradipa printed 
by Jivananda. Similarly Apararka ( pp. 94-95 ) quotes three verses 
of Katyayana that are very interesting but are not found in 

411 *R STON faTO: Md-H*H: fl^qpri' I WlNl Rm^WIM I iRW^f <f 



88. KSttflyana &1 

Jfivananda's edition.*" Later works like the Nirnayasindhu, the 
Samskaramayakha, the Madanaparijata quote numerous verses of 
Katyayana on upanayana, marriage and other samskaras which we 
vainly seek to find in the Karmapradipa. Hence it follows that^ 
there was some large work of Katyayana of which the Karmapradipa 
is either an abridgment or only a portion. 

The next question is whether Katyayana the jurist and the 
author of the Karmapradipa are identical. There are not sufficient 
data to identify the two. The only fact that points to the identity 
is that such eminent and early writers as Vijiianesvara and Apararka 
appear to make no distinction between the two. Besides the 
Karmapradipa is also an early work. Against this it has to be re- 
membered that Visvarapa, probably the most ancient of all extant 
commentators, nowhere quotes Katyayana on acara and praya&itta. 
This absence of quotations is not a very cogent argument; still it 
raises a doubt in one's mind whether a work of Katyayana on acara 
and other non-jural topics was known to Visvarupa. 

The other principal versified smrtis will now be described in 
( Sanskrit ) alphabetical order. 

» 
39. Angiras 

From Visvarupa downwards Artgiras is quoted very frequently 
on all topics except that of civil law ( vyavahara ). Afigiras is one 
of the writers on dharma enumerated by Yaj. Visvarupa" ( on Yaj. 
I. 9 ) states that according to Artgiras a parifad may comprise 121 
Brahmapas. On Yaj. I. 50 Visvarupa quotes a verse of Afigiras 
that what is done according to one's own will without following 
the dictates of &stra is fruitless.* 1 * On Yaj. III. 248 ViSvarfcpa 
says that the vrata called Vajra was prescribed by Aflgiras for 
Brahmanas guilty of deadly sins. Visvarupa ( on Yaj. III. 265 ) 
quotes two verses of AAgiris on the prayascitta for killing the wife 
of a Brahmapa who has kindled the sacred fires, for killing wives of

other Brahmapas and Ksatriyas and Vaifyas. On Yaj. III. 266 he 
quotes two verses of Arigiras laying down prSya&itta for killing 
certain beasts and birds, wherein Angiras himself is mentioned with 
honour ( bhagavan ). Apararka ( pp. 22-23 ) quotes thirteen verses 
/from Afigiras on the constitution of parifad, wherein such terms as 
chaturvidya, vitarki, artgavid, dharmapathaka are explained and the 
last of which says that uparfead sitting in judgment over those who 
are guilty of mahapatakas may consist of hundreds. The Mitaksara 
(on Yaj. I. 86) quotes several verses on the practice of sail and 
ascribes them to both Saftkha and Afigiras. 414 Apararka ( pp. 109, 
112) quotes four other verses on the same practice, one of which is 
in the Indravajra metre and another prohibits a Brahmana wife from 
following that practice. Medhatithi (on Manu. V. 157) quotes 
the view of Artgiras on sati and disapproves of it. The Mitaksara, 
Haradatta and others quote numerous verses of Artgiras on asauca 
and prayascitta. Haradatta on Gautama (20. 1 ) quotes a verse of 
Angiras about the seven antyajass 1 * Visvarupa ( on Yaj. III. 237 ) 
quotes a sutra of Sumantu in which Afigirasa is cited as an authority. 
The Suddhi-mayukha quotes a verse of Angiras which relies upon 
Satatapa. 416 The Sirnticandrika quotes AAgiras on the enumeration 
of Upasmrtis (vide note 260 above). The Smrticandrika also contains 
a few prose quotations from Angiras ; the same work cites a verse 
of Angiras holding the dharmasastra of Manu as the supreme 
guide. 417 

The Angiras-smrti ( in Jivananda part I, pp. 554-5*5°) in 72 
verses is probably an abridgment. It lays down prayascittas for 
various occasions, such as taking food and drink from antyajas, for 
cruelly beating or causing various injuries to cows. It also lays 
down various rules for the wearing of the dark cloth ( nilivastra ) 
by women. It cites Angiras and Apastamba by name. The 
penultimate verse condemns those who rob women^ of their wealth.

89m JLngirw 

There are several mss. in the Deccan College Collection whihe- 
contain a varying number of verses on prayascitta agreeing more rs. 
less with Jivananda's text. For example, No. 53 of 1879-8*. 
contains about one hundred verses, No. 205 of 1882-83 contains 54 
verses, while No. 65 of Visrambag collection and No. 83 of 1895- 
1902 contain only 32 ; No. 81 of 1884-86 is styled Brhad-Angiras 
and contains 151 verses, many of which are identical with those in 
the Calcutta text. 

The Mitaksara (on Yaj. III. 277) and the Smrtiratnavali of 
Vedacarya ( I. O. cat. No. 1552 p. 475 ) quote a Brhad-Arigiras and 
the Mitaksara also quotes a Madhyama-Angiras several times (on Yaj. 
III. 243, 241, 258, and 260). 

40. Rsyasrnga 

This is a writer who is frequently quoted on acara, asauca, sraddha, 
and prayascitta by the Mit., Apararka, Smrticandrika and other works. 
Apararka ( p. 724 ) quotes as Rsyasrriga's a verse ascribed to Saiikha 
in the Mitaksara (on Yaj. II. 119) and other works, which states 
that when one coparcener recovers with his own efforts family 
property that was lost to the family, he gets a fourth share of it and 
the others become sharers : in the rest/ 18 The Smrticandrika (I. 
p. 32) quotes * api vasasa yajnopavitarthan kuryat tadabhave trivjta 
sutrena ', which is in prose. 

41. Karsnajini 

This writer is quoted by the Mit. ( Yaj. III. 265 three verses), 
Apararka, Smrticandrika and other works mostly on sraddha. 
Apararka (p. 138) quotes a verse from him which enumerates the 
seven sons of Brahma, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, Kapila, Asuri, 
Vodha (?) and Pancasikha. Apararka ( p. 424 ) quotes a verse which 
refers to the two signs of the Zodiac, Kanya, and Vrscika. 

42. Carurvimsatimata 

There are two Mss. of this work in the Deccan College Collection 
(No 244 of A- 1881-1882 and in of 1895-1902). It contains 
525 verses. The work is so called because it embodies the essence 
of the teachings of 24 sages, Manu, Yajnavalkya, Atri, Vi§ou, 



/ 



ottyasistha, Vyasa, U£anas, Apastamba, Vatsa, Harita, Guru 
qitfBjrhaspati), Narada, Para£ara, Gargya, Gautama, Yama, Baudhayana, 
ce<Dak$a, Saftkha, Afigiras, Satatapa, Safikhya (SaAkhyayana? ), 
h Samvarta. The subjects treated of are :-The usages of the var^as and 
&ramas, Sauca, acamana, cleansing the teeth, bath, pranayama, 
repeating the Gayatri, study of the Vedas, marriage, agnihotra, five 
great daily yajfias, means of livelihood, forest hermits, samnyasins, 
duties of Ksatriyas and the other two varnas, prayascittas for the 
deadly sins and other lesser misdeeds, means of livelihood, sraddha, 
aSauca (on birth and death ). 

The work often quotes the views of Usanas, Manu, Parasarya, 
AAgiras, Yama, Harita. It quotes Manu III. 5 ( asapinda ca ya etc. ) 
andManui2. 95 (ya vedabahyah smrtayah. ). Two other verses 
which it contains are indicated as interpolated in several editions ot 
Manu.* 1 ? It says that the teachings of Arhat, Carvaka and 
Buddhas delude people.* 10 Its position is that whatever is not 
found in the Veda or the Puranas, the Ramayana, or Mahabharata 
or in the &stras of Manu and others is as good as non-existent.* 21 

The Caturvimiatimata is frequently quoted by the Mit., 
Apararka and later works, but not by Visvarupa and Mcdhatithi. It 
was probably compiled about the time when the latter two writers 
flourished. Apararka (p. 11 21 ) quotes a prose passage from the 
work on the prayascitta for a dvijati procreating children on a Sudra 
wife. This passage could not be traced in the two mss. referred to 
above.

with the commentary of Bhaftoji, son of Laksmidhara, have been

published in the Benares Sanskrit|Series (Nos. 137 and 139). The 
commentary is a very learned one and refers to a host of writers. 
This commentary is in some mss. ascribed to Ramacandra (vide I. 
O. cat. No. 1554, p. 475). 

43. Daksa 

Daksa is one of the writers on dharma enumerated by Yaj. 
Visvarupa quotes verses of Daksa several times, viz. on Yaj. 1. 17 
( on clods of earth for purifying the body), on Yaj. III. 30 (two 
verses on asauca ), on Yaj. III. 66 (about a parivrajaka ), on Yaj, 
III. 191 ( about padmasana ). The Mit. (on Yaj. I. 89) quotes a 
half verse of Daksa to the effect that a dvija should not remain 
unattached to an asrama ( i. e. without a wife in the context ) even 
for a moment; on Yaj. III. 58 two verses about bhiksus; on Yaj. 
III. 243 (one verse). Apararka cites numerous verses of Dak?a 
on acara, asauca, sraddha and similar topics. In one case ( p. 368 ) 
he attributes a prose passage to Daksa about the gift of gold.*" 
Two of Daksa's verses most frequently quoted by writers on 
vyavahara are those that lay down what nine things cannot be the 
subjects of gift. 4*1 

In Jivananda's collection there is a Daksasmrti [( part II, pp. 383- 
402 ) in seven chapters and 220 verses ( vide also Anandasrama 
collection pp. 72-84 ). The principal subjects treated of are:— 
Four asramas, two kinds of brahmacarins ; the daily round of duties 
for dvijas ; various subdivisions of actions, nine karmans, nine 
vikarmans, nine actions that should be concealed, nine acts that 
should be made public, nine things that should not be gifted ; gifts ; 
eulogy of a good housewife ; sauca of two kinds ; impurity due to 
birth and death ; Yoga and its six angas viz. prai?ayama, dhyana, 
pratyahara, dharana, tarka and samadhi, maithuna of eight kinds 
to be avoided by ascetics, duties of bhiksu, dvaita, and advaita. 

This smjti is certainly a very old one. All the quotations from 
Dak§a cited by Visvarupa occur in the printed Daksa ( vide pp. 395,

'396*384,397 which reads 'na pathyasanad yogo'). Similarly all 
the quotations in the Mit. from Daksa are found in the Calcutta text. 
Apararka contains over forty verses from the printed Daksa, though 
, there are a few verses cited by him as Daksa's which are not found 
< therein. The Smrticandrika quotes about ten verses of Daksa on 
woman which are all found in the 4th chap, of the Calcutta text. 

In the Deccan College collection there is a ms. of Daksa ( No. 
120 of 1895-1902 ) which contains 197 verses on the same topics 
as above, many of which are identical with the Calcutta text. The 
Bombay University has also a similar ms. Vide I. O. cat. No. 1320 
p. 385 for a similar ms. in 197 verses. 

44. Pitamaha 

Pitamaha is enumerated among writers on dharma in a verse of 
Vfddha-Yajnvalkya quoted by Visvarupa. The Smrti of Pitamaha 
is drawn upon mostly on vyavahara. Visvarupa cites ( on Yaj. I. 
17 ) a verse from him on sauca.*** Mit. and Apararka quote verses 
from Pitamaha only on vyavahara and specially on ordeals. The 
Smrticandrika quotes about ten verses on ahnika, 130 on 
vyavahara and only a few on sraddha. Pitamaha regards the Vedas 
with the arigas, Mimariisa, the smrtis, Purana and Nyaya system as 
dharmasastras. 425 Pitamaha like Brhaspati enumerates nine kinds of 
ordeals, 426 while Yaj. and Narada name only five, though the latter 
seems to have known two more, viz. tandula and taptamasa. The 
Smrticandrika quotes a dozen verses about 50 chalas on which a 
king took action without any complaint. 42 ? Pitamaha seems to 
have followed Vyasa in defining documents called krayapatra, 
sthitipatra, sarhdhipatra, visuddhipatra. 4 * 8 The Smrticandrika cites

44. Piffimaha £27 

Pitamaha for an enumeration of the 18 prakrtis viz. washerman, 
leather worker, etc 4 ** The same work states that according to 
Pitamaha the titles of law to be taken cognisance by the king himself 
were twenty-two. In the hall of justice, he says, there should be 
eight constituents viz. the scribe, the accountant, sastra, the 
sadhyapala, the assessors, gold, fire and water.** Some of the 
other note worthy dicta of Pitamaha are : — a suit should be*' 1 first 
tried before the village (pancayat), then before the town (court of 
appeal), then before the king; between litigants of the same country, 
town, societies, cities and villages, the decision should be arrived at 
according to their own peculiar conventions and usages, but when 
there is a dispute between these and strangers, the decision must be 
according to the sastra; possession** 2 in order to be recognised by 
the courts as decisive must have five characteristics, it must have 
title, long duration, it must be uninterrupted, it must not have been 
impeached and it must be before the eyes of the opponent ; a private 
document 4 " under one's own hand is inferior to a jclnapada (a 
publicly written and attested) deed, the latter is inferior to a royal 
edict, this last is inferior to possession continued for three 
generations. 

Pitamaha is later than Brharpati, 4 ' 4 as he cites the latter's view 
that a litigation between members of the same village, society, town, 
guild, caravan or army must be decided according to their peculiar 
usages. Therefore Pitamaha must be assigned to some date between 
the 4th and 7th century A. D.

45. Pulastya 

Pulastya is one of the expounders of dharma enumerated by 

Zrddha-Yajnavalkya. ViSvarQpa quotes a verse from him on sarira- 
uca.«s The Mit. ( on Yaj. I. 261 ) cites a verse from Pulastya 
that a Brahmana should principally use ascetic's food ( i. e. vegetable 
food ) in Sriddha, that ksatriyas and vaisyas should use meat and 
Sfidras honey .« 6 The Mit. ( Yaj. Ill 253 ) quotes two verses of 
Pulastya who enumerates eleven intoxicating drinks together with 
sura as the twelfth/" Apararka quotes several verses from Pulastya 
on samdhya, Sraddha, Ssauca, duties of yatis, prayascitta. Apararka 
quotes two verses from Pulastya propounding the view that a com- 
bination of j nana and karma is the correct view.*'* The first of 
these verses is ascribed by him to Yoga-Yajnav.ilkya elsewhere 
( note 336 ). The Smrticandrika quotes about forty verses from 
Pulastya on ahnika and sraddha. In one place it quotes Pulastya 
on the efficacy of bathing on Sunday, Tuesday, and Saturday.*** 
In another place it refers to thejapa of Rama, Parasurama, Nrsirhha, 
Trivikrama. 

The Danaratnakara of Cande^vara cites a prose text from Pulastya 
on the gift of deer-skin/ 40

46. Pracetas 

Pracetas finds a place among the sages enumerated by Para£ara 
though not in Yajnavalkya. In both Mit. and Apararka there are 
passages in prose and verse ascribed to Pracetas on daily duties, 
iraddha, a£auca, praya&itta. The Mit. ( on Yaj. III. 27 ) quotes 
a verse from Pracetas saying that workmen, artisans, physicians, 
male and female slaves, kings, royal officers have not to observe 
periods of impurity 44 ' ( on death ), This verse is cited as a smjrti 
by Medhatithi on Manu V. 60 without ascribing it to Pracetas. 
So Medhatithi looked upon Pracetas as equally authoritative with 
Manu, Visnu and others. 

The Mit. (on Yaj. Ill 20, 263-64), Haradatta (on Gautama 22. 18) 
and Apararka frequently cite verses from Brhat-Pracetas on akuca and 
prayascitta. The Mit. and Apararka also quote verses on the same 
topics from Vrddha-Pracetas. 

A few prose quotations from Pracetas are noted in the Smrti- 
candrika and by Haradatta ( on Gautama 23. 1 ). 

47. Prajapati 

Prajapati is cited as an authority by the Baudhayanadharmasutra 
( II. 4. 15 and II. 10. 71 ). Vasistha several times quotes Prajapatya 
slokas ( viz. III. 47, XIV 16-19, 24-27, 30-32 ). It has been shown 
above that most of these verses are found in the Manusmrti or have 
close correspondence with verses of Manu. So it is not unlikely 
that both the writers of dharmasutras mean Manu by Prajapati. 

In the Anandasrama collection ( p. 90-98 ) there is a smrti of 
Prajapati in 198 verses on the various details of sraddha, such as 
the time, place, the persons authorised to perform, proper food, 
Brahma^as to be invited etc. The prevailing metre is Anustubh, 
but there are nine verses in the Indravajra, Upajati, Vasantatilaka 
( verse 137 ) and Sragdhara ( verse 96 ). It speaks of Kalpa&stra, 
smrtis, dharmasastra, purapas. It contains a verse referring to the 
Kanya and Vr&ika ( scorpion ) signs of the zodiac, which is almost 
the same as a verse of Kar§najini. 



MO HUtory of DharmaiUstra 

The Mit. ( on Yaj. III. 25 and 260 ) quotes verses of Prajapati on 
iSauca and prayascitta. Apararka cites verses of Prajapati on purifi- 
cation of various substances, sraddha, witnesses, ordeals and aiauca. 
None of these is traced to the printed text of Prajapati. Apararka 
( P* 95 2 ) g* ves a ' on £ P rose text °f Prajapati on the four orders of 
parivrajakas, viz. kuficaka, bahudaka, hamsa, paramahaihsa. 
Apararka ( p. 542 ) cites a verse of Laugaksi which refers to the 
view of Prajapati that the son of a putrika was to offer pindas to 
his mother by the gotra of his maternal grand-father."* Apararka, 
Smrticandrika, Parasara-Madhaviya and other works quote several 
verses of Prajapati on vyavahara. Witnesses are of two kinds, krta 
and akrta. In this he seems to have followed Narada ( rnadana, 
verse 149 ). Prajapati lays down the characteristics of valid reply 
( uttara ) of the defendant and defines"* the four varieties of uttara. 
The Parasara-Madhaviya cites several verses of Prajapati on ordeals. 
Prajapati recognised the right of the sonlcss widow to succeed to her 
husband's wealth"* and enjoined on her the duty of offering sraddha 
every month and year to her husband's manes and to honour his 
relatives/* 6 

48. Marici 

This sage is relied upon as an authority by the Mit., Apararka, Smrti- 
candrika on Ahnika, Asauca, Sraddha, Prayascitta and Vyavahara. 
Apararka quotes several verses on tarpaya one of which speaks of Sun- 
day. 447 Marici disallows bathing in the rivers in the months of Sravana

and Bhadrapada." 8 Marici made a very near approach to the modern 
conceptions underlying the Transfer of Property Act. 'Completeness 
is not attained without writing in the transactions of sale, mortgage, 
partition and gift of immoveable property'. 44 * If a buyer purchases 
a chattel before a row of merchants and to the knowledge of the 
king's officers and in broad daylight, he is free from blame and gets 
back his money ( if the thing turns out to be another's property ), 
while if the price (paid by a buyer for a chattel) cannot be recovered 
( from the vendor who sells without title ) owing to the vendor's 
address being not known, the loss should be apportioned between 
the buyer and the original owner of the chattel. 4 * Marlci divides 
adhi into four varieties, bhogya, gopya, pratyaya, ajnadhi. 

It is to be noted that Apararka ( p. 908 ) quotes a prose passage 
of Marici on asauca. 

49. Yama 

The Vasistfia-dharmasutra ( 18. 13-15 and 19.48) cites four 
slokas of Yama and quotes (11. 20) one verse in which Yama is 
spoken of as an authority. All the slokas except one are found in 
Manu. 4 *' Vasisfha quotes a sloka of Prajapati wherein Yama's view

is set forth. Yama is one of the sages enumerated in the list of 
Yajnavalkya. Govindanija ( on Manu 5. 16 ) and Aparirka quote 
a verse of Sartkha wherein Yamas' view that the flesh of certain birds 
could be eaten is referred to. 4 ** Apartrka (p, 1231) also cites 
a verse of Sankha in which the view of Bhagavan Yama that one 
should save one's life in all ways ( even by incurring sin ) is relied 
upon. 

In Jivananda's collection ( part I. pp. 360-568) there is a smrti 
of Yama in seventyeight verses on prayascitta and purification 
( suddhi ). In this smrti Yama himself is cited in the third person 
( verse 65 ). One verse ( 33 ) refers to the view of Bhasvati (son of 
the sun, by which may be meant either Manu or Yama himself).*" 
Some of the verses are identical with those of Manu (e. g. verses 
26, 28 are the same as Manu 11. 178 and 3. 19 ). Verse 44 is 
in the Upajati metre. In the Anandasrama collection there is a 
Yamasmrti in 99 verses on prayafcitta, sraddha, and purification. 
Most of the topics of this smrti are the same as those of the Calcutta 
text, but most of the verses are not identical. A few verses are 
found in both, e. g. the verses about the seven lowesi castes 4 5 < 
( antyajas ). Verse 1 1 quotes the view of Satitapa. This smrti 
contains the well-known text that a woman passes on marriage into 
the gotra of her husband, which is cited by the Mit. (on Yaj. I. 
254 ).»>'* In the same collection there is a smrti of Brhad-Yama 
(pp. 99-107). It is divided into five chapters and contains 182 
verses. It deals with prayascittas for various lapses, purification 
from various kinds of contacts ( suddhi ), Sraddha, partition and a 
few matters of medical procedure. In this smrti Yama is frequently 
cited by name. §atatapa is cited on partition ( V. 20 ). Many of 
the verses of this text are identical with those of Yama in Jivananda's 
text. For example, Jivananda (p. 561 ) verses 15-17 are the same

as Bphad- Yama III. 1-3, Jivananda p. 563 verses ; 29-33 are the same 
as Brhad-Yama III. 34-38, Jivananda verses 35-36 are the same as 
Brhad-Yama III. 16-17. The verse in the Upajati metre (Jivananda 
44 ) is Brhad-Yama III. 61. Two of the verses at the end of chap. 
V. are the same as Yaj. II. 17 and 23. 

The numerous mss. of Yama contain either one or other of the 
above three texts or different texts bearing on the same topics. For 
example, Deccan College collection Nos. 209-211 of A 1881-82 
and No. 153 of 1893-1902 are the same as the Yamasmrti in the 
Anandasrama collection, No. 401 of 1891-95 seems to be the same as 
Brhad-Yama in the Anandasrama collection. But the I. O. Cat. No. 
1334 p. 390 contains 57 Slokas, the last 20 of which are in the 
Indravajra metre. 

Visvarupa, Vijfianesvara, Apararka, the Smrticandrika and 
other later works quote over three hundred verses of Yama on all 
topics of dharmasastra including vyavahara. This establishes that 
they had an extensive work of Yama before them from which it is 
probable various abridgments corresponding with the printed works 
were made. Visvarupa quotes about ten verses of Yama on water 
as purifier ( on Yaj. I. 187 ), on sraddha (on Yaj. I. 225 and 252) 
and on prayascitta for killing a cow (on Yaj. III. 262 ). The identi- 
cal verses are not found in the printed texts. Some of the verses 
quoted from Yama in Apararka and the Smrticandrika can be 
traced in the printed text. For example, Apararka (p. 42 ) quotes 
a verse of Yama in which Yama himself is referred to as an 
authority." 6 It occurs in Jivananda's text ( verse 65 ). The two 
verses in Jivananda's text ( verses 26, 28 ) that are identical with 
Manu are cited in the Smrticandrika as Yama's. Two verses of 
Brhad-Yama ( III. 20-21) about the proper age of marriage in the 
case of girls are quoted as Yama's in the Smrticandrika.*" In 
some of the verses quoted by Apararka from Yama, the opinions of 
. Manu are cited which can be identified with the views of the Manu-

smrti. For example, according to Yama food polluted by the touch 
of hair, moths and insects, or seen by sinners and women in their 
courses is purified by water, holy ashes etc.** 8 This refers to Manu 
V. 125. Similarly the Smrticandrika quotes a verse of Yama which 
says that according to Manu those who administer poison, who are 
incendiaries and robbers and those guilty of homicide and abetment 
thereof should pay the extreme penalty of death. *" Apararka ( p. 
988 on Yaj. III. 109) quotes five verses of Yama which refer to the 
26th tattvas well known in the Sahkhya system, regard Purusottama 
as a 26 tattva and propound that he who correctly understands the 25 
tattvas, in whatever asrama he may be, reaches the highest abode of 
Visnu. Apararka quotes a few prose passages from Yama on the 
garments to be worn by brahmacarins,* 60 on prayascitta for killing 
various kinds of birds and insects, for cutting trees and bushes, for 
drinking wine, for stealing gold and for the other deadly sins etc.* 61 

The Mahabharata (Anusasana 104. 72-74) quotes gdtbdsof Yama. 

The Smrticandrika quotes a verse of Yama which speaks of the 
sun being in the zodiacal sign Virgo. 462 

Yama required the king to look into the disputes of litigants 
carefully and impartially. 46 * Yama cites the authority of Manu for 
the proposition that everything brought about by coercion such as 
a gift or a deed was liable to be set aside. This is almost identical 
with Manu 8. 168. Yama lays down that a Brahmana was never 
to be awarded corporal punishment, but that a Brahmana guilty of

crimes was to be imprisoned and made* 6 * to work. Yama, like Yaj. 
^ II. 145 ), prescribed that the stridhana of a woman married in the 
Asura form went to her father/ 66 if she died childless. Apararka (p. 
822 ) quotes two verses of Yama that prescribed the first ammerce- 
ment for him who, though forbidden, wrongfully takes the water 
of a lake or disturbs a water-course and the highest ammercement 
for him who breaks a lake. Apararka ( p. 860 ) also cites Yama 
for the fine of five krsnalas in the case of adultery with another's 
wife of the same caste as that of the paramour and twelve panas in case 
the wife is of a lower caste. The Smrticandrika and the Vyavahara- 
mayukha on the other hand direct that the king should punish the 
Brahmana woman guilty of adultery with a Sudra by throwing her 
to dogs and by forcible tonsure and riding on an ass in case of adul- 
tery with a Ksatriya or Vaisya. The Smrticandrikara, Parasara- 
Madhaviya and Vyavaharamayukha quote a verse of Yama about a 
debtor, who, being able to pay, does not wantonly pay, being 
punished by taking twice the amount. Yama remarks that the order 
of samnyasa is not allowed to women in the Vedas or in the s&stra 4 * 7 
( dharmasastra ) and that her real dharma is to be the mother of 
children from one of her own caste. A Brhad-Yama is cited by the 
Mit. ( on Yaj. III. 255 and 290 ), Haradatta and by Apararka on 
prayascitta. Similarly a Laghu-Yama is cited by Haradatta and 
Apararka and a Svalpa-Yama ( probably same as Laghu-Yama ) by 
the Smrtiratnakara of Vedacarya. 

5o. Laugaksi 

The Mit. (on Yaj III. 1-2,260, 289) quotes verses of Laugaksi 
on asauca and prayascitta. Apararka quotes prose passages and verses 
of Laugaksi on the samskaras, vaisvadeva, caturmasya, purification

of substances, sraddha, a£auca and prayascitta. Apararka cites 
( p. 5 12 ) a verse of Laugaksi which regards Prajapati as an authority. 
The Mit. and almost all works on vyavahara cite a verse of Laugaksi 
defining yoga and ksema and prescribing that they are impartible. 

5i. Visvamitra 

Visvamitra is one of the writers on dharma enumerated by 
Vrddha-Yajnavalkya as quoted by Visvariipa. Apararka, the Smrti- 
candrika, the Kalaviveka of Jimutavahanaand other works quote verses 
of Visvamitra on almost all topics of dharma except vyavahara, such 
as on the five deadly sins, on sraddhas, prayascitta etc. Visvamitra 
defines dharma as that which is esteemed by Aryas (respectable 
people ) who know the Vcdas.^ 68 His verses on the mahapatakas 
are frequently quoted. 46 * The Madras ( Govt. ) Mss. cat. ( p. 1985 
No. 2717 ) notices a smrti of Visvamitra in verse in nine chapters. 

52. Vyasa 

In Jivananda ( part II pp. 321-342) and in the Anandasrama 
collection of smrtis there is a smrti ascribed to Vyasa. The two 
texts are the same with a few variations. It is in four chapters and 
contains about 250 verses. Vyasa is said to have declared the smrti 
in Benares. The contents briefly are : — the dharmas herein laid 
down prevail only in that region where the black deer roam about ; 
the authoritativeness of suit?, smrti and puranas; mixed castes; 
sixteen sariiskaras ; duties of Brahmacari ; marriage ; Brahmana may 
rharry Ksatriya or Vaisya girl but not Sudra ; duties of a wife ; the 
hitya, naimittika and kamya acts of householders, eulogy of the house- 
holder stage and of gifts. 

Visvariipa quotes a few verses of Vyasa. They are mostly taken 
from the Mahabharata and are concerned with topics of marriage, 
daily duties ( such as washing the teeth and bathing ), Sraddha and 
prayascitta. Similarly Medhatithi quotes several verses from the

Mahabharata as Vy&sa's. In Apararka, the Smjticandrika and other 
works about two hundred verses of Vyasa are cited on vyavahara. 
From these it appears that Vyasa dealt with rules of procedure and 
the several titles of law ( vyavahara-padas ) and that his doctrines 
closely agreed in most respects with those of Narada, Katyayana and 
Brhaspati. He gives rules on the four kinds of uttara ( mithya, 
sarhpratipatti, karana and praft-nyaya ), divides documents in three 
varieties ( svahasta, janapada, raja&sana ), divides laukika documents 
into eight sub-varieties ( just as Katyayana seems to have done ) ; 
he closely follows Brhaspati in his requirements about royal grants 
and two of his verses about grants ( sastim varsa &c. and sama- 
nyoyam dharmasetur nrpanam) occur very frequently in inscriptions 
(vide Apararka on Yaj. I. 318 ). Vyasa lays down that if a stranger 
enjoy a person's land for twenty years when the king is there ( i. e. 
when there is no revolution or anarchy ) and when the owner is 
able (to resist) the latter loses his property. 4 ? He speaks of adverse 
possession as having five characteristics. 4 ? 1 He mentions seven 
kinds of sureties, while Harita and Katyayana speak of only five 
and Brhaspati of four. He speaks of only five kinds of ordeals. 
He defines a nifka as equal to 14 suvarnas, a suvarna being equal 
to eight palas. 4 ? 2 Vyasa seems to represent a middle stage in the 
evolution of the rights of the widow to succeed to her deceased 
husband. He says that a woman was to get a maximum of two 
thousand ( karsapanas ) from the estate of her deceased husband 4 ?* 
( besides what he gave her when living ). Vyasa gave to the father 
and sons equal shares in ancestral property and allowed partition 
even against the wish of the father. 4 ? 4 From these important charac-

WB History cf DharmaiMra 

teristics of Vyasa it may safely be concluded that Vyasa flourished 
about the same time as Yajnavalkya and Brhaspati, i. e. between the 
second and the fifth century. 

In Apararka and other works there are numerous verses attribut- 
ed to Vyasa which are certainly not taken from the Mahabharata or 
from the Vyasasmpiin the Anandasrama collection (pp. 3S7-371). For 
example, on Yaj. I. 12 he cites a verse of Vyasa in the Vasantatilaka 
metre about the auspicious asterism for catila and another verse laying 
down Saturday, Sunday and Friday as unsuitable for caula. Similar- 
ly Vyasa's verses dealing with the merit of bathing on Sunday, 
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in conjunction with certain 
tithis are cited by Apararka ( p. 213 ). Vyasa speaks of sraddhas 
when the Sun is in the sign of Virgo ( Apararka p. 424 ). These 
indications are sufficient to assign Vyasa to a comparatively later 
date. But as Apararka evidently makes no distinction between 
Vyasa the jurist, Vyasa the reputed compiler of the Mahabharata 
( e. g. he quotes on p. 961 six verses of the Bhagavatgita as Vyasa's) 
and Vyasa who wrote on the samskaras, sraddha and other topias, it 
appears that the jurist and the writer on other topics of dharma were 
separated from him by several centuries. Whether the jurist and 
the writer on other topics of dharma are identical is a difficult pro- 
blem. All that can be said is that the two may probably be identical. 
The Smrticandrika quotes a Gadya- Vyasa and about 450 verses of 
Vyasa on ahnika, vyavahara and prayascitta. 

Apararka quotes a verse of Vrddha-Vyasa on Saudayika, a kind of 
stridhana. The Mit., the Prayascitta-mayukha and other works 
cite verses of a Brhad-Vyasa. Ballalasena in his Danasagara quotes 
Maha- Vyasa and Laghu-Vyasa as authorities and also Dana-Vyasa, 
which probably means the dana-dharma portions of the Mahabharata. 

53. Sat-trimsan-mata 

This appears to have been a work like the Caturvimsatimata 
described above. Quotations from it are cited in the Kalpataru, the 
Mitaksara, the Smrticandrika, Apararka, Haradatta and a host of 
writers and works. Mitramisra^> says that though the $at-trimfen- 






68. Sat-triManrmata 239 

niata has been accepted as an authority by the above-mentioned 
writers, yet certain other writers did not hold the work authoritative. 
The fact that Vi^varupa and Medhatithi do not mention this work, 
taken along with the above statement of Mitramisra, may be relied 
upon for holding that this compilation must have been among the 
latest products of the age of smrtis and was probably compiled some 
time between 700-900 A. D. Almost all the quotations from this 
compilatiou are concerned with the topics of purification of sub- 
stances (£uddhi), sraddha and pfayascittas for sins and pollutions of 
various sorts. No verse of this compilation dealing with vyavahara 
could he discovered. One verse quoted from it prescribes a bath 
on touching Bauddhas, Pasupatas, Jainas, atheists and followers 
of Kapila. 4 ? 6 Another verse quoted by Apararka cites the view of 
Brhaspati. 477 In another verse the view of Vaivasvata is referred 
to. 178 Apararka quotes a prose passage from this compilation 
prescribing the prayascittas for touching the corpse of a candala etc. 
As no ms. was available, it is difficult to say what 36 sages arc 
relied upon as authorities. 

54. Samgraha or Smrtisamgraha 

This work is frequently cited by the Mitaksara, Apararka, the 
Smrticandrika and other works on all topics of dharma. The 
quotations on vyavahara are copious and are very important for the 
history of Hindu Law. A few of the important views of the Saihgraha- 
kara are set out below. He gives the requisite characteristics of a 
plaint in five verses.*™ According to him documents are of two kinds, 
rajakiya and janapada. The ordeals from dhata ( balance ) to poison

ordeals ( in all three ) are prescribed in disputes for lesser sums/ 80 
This is slightly opposed to Nirada ( rnadana verse 336) according 
to whom the five ordeals from tula to kosa were prescribed in 
substantial disputes/ 81 The Samgrahakara has in view the seven 
ordeals spoken of by Narada (rnadana verses 252, 337, 343 ), while 
Brhaspati and Pitamaha enumerate nine. He defines daya as the 
wealth that is handed down through father and mother/ 8 * He held 
that ownership arose from the dictates of sastra and was not an 
affair of the world (laukika) and puts forward two reasons in 
support of his theory, viz. if ownership were laukika, then it would 
not be possible to make such assertions as 'his wealth has been wrong- 
fully seized by another' and the texts (vide Gautama X. 39) laying 
down the means of acquisition of wealth for the several varnas 
would be meaningless/ 8 * Dharesvara held the same view. These 
views were elaborately criticized by the Mit. According to the 
Samgrahakara/ 84 partition creates ownership in the son as regards 
paternal wealth ( in which he has no rights by birth ). Dharesvara 
entertained the same opinion, which was vehemently controverted 
by the Mit., holding that partition takes place of that in which one 
has already ownership. Accordingt o the Samgraha/ 8 * ownership does 
not consist in being able to dispose of a thing at one's sweet will, 
since it is the sastra that prescribes the proper disposal or application 
of all things. The Samgraha 486 laid down that the special share given 
to the eldest son, the practice of niyoga and the offering of a cow 
are all forbidden in the present age. Dharesvara also held the same

view about the eldest son's rights and the Mit. also approves of it 
and quotes anonymously the same verse (onYaj.II. 117). The 
Samgraha in two verses, apparently following Manu 9. 182-183, 
lays down that, if of several full brothers one has a son, all thereby 
have issue and that, if one out of the several wives of a person has a 
son, all the co-wives may be regarded as putravati. The Smrti- 
candrika says that Devasvami explained this dictum of the Samgraha- 
kara. The Samgraha says that the widow of a separated coparcener 
dying childless would inherit his whole estate if she submitted to 
Niyoga at the behests of her elders.* 8 ? This was also the opinion of 
Dhare£vara and was refuted according to the Smrticandrika by 
Visvarupa. The Mir. also criticizes this view. He names Manu in 
connection with the succession of a person dying without leaving 
any one out of the twelve kinds of sons.* 88 He has in view Manu 9. 
185. According to the Samgrahakara the order of succession to a 
sonless man is : — widow, the daughter who is a putrika, 
mother, paternal grandmother, father, full brothers, half- 
brothers, the line of the father ( pitrsantati ), the grand- 
father's line, the great-grand-father's line, other sapindas, sakulyas, 
the preceptor, the pupil, a fellow-student, a learned Brahmaga. 
The Mit. notes that relying on Manu (9. 217) DhareSvara placed 
the paternal grandmother after the mother and before the father (thus 
agreeing with the Saihgraha ). (The Samgraha says that homicide 
and other offences when commited with force are called sdhasa.*** 

It will be seen from the above that the views of the Samgraha- 
kara closely agreed with those of Dharesvara in many respects and 
were not approved of by the Mit. and other later writers. In 
vyavahara the Samgraha certainly marks a far more advanced 
stage than Yajfiavalkya and Narada, whose works do not contain the 
controvertial questions about ownership, partition etc. As Dhare- 
svara agrees very closely with the Smftisaihgraha it may be argued 
that they were not separated by a long interval of time. It has to be

also noted that ViSvarfipa and Medhatithi do not refer to the 
Samgraha. It is not unlikely that the Sarhgraha was in vogue in the 
territory ruled over by Bhoja of Dhara and was therefore followed by 
Bhoja Dharesvara. Taking all things into consideration the Samgraha 
was probably compiled between the 8th and ioth centuries of the 
Christian era. The Smrticandrika no doubt says in one place that 
the Samgrahakara follows the views of DhareSvara.** But this 
statement should not be emphasized and interpreted too literally. 
All that it means is that both held the same opinion. There is no 
intention to state that DhareSvara preceded the Samgrahakara. 
Chronology was never the strong point of Indian commentators, 
particularly when the writers whose opinions were referred to flourish- 
ed several centuries earlier. We know that Bharuci and Dharesvara 
preceded the Mitaksara which names both; but the Sarasvativilasa in 
several places (e. g. pp. 347, 361, 383 ) says that Bharuci cannot 
tolerate the view of Vijnanesvara and also says that Dharesvara and 
Devasvami follow the view of Vijnanayogin ( p. 395 ). 

The Smrticandrika quotes several verses from the Samgraha on 
topics of sraddha in which Gautama, Katyayana, Parafora, Manu, 
Yajiiavalkya, Yama and Saunaka are cited by name. 4 * 1 

55. Samvarta 

Samvarta occurs as a Smrtikara in the list of Yajiiavalkya. He is 

cited on all topics of dharma by Visvarupa, Medhatithi, the Mit., 

Haradatta, Apararka, the Smrticandrika and a host of other writers. 

Visvarupa quotes either wholly or in part about twenty verses of 

Samvarta on evening sandhya-vandana, on the duties of a yati and 

on the prayascittas for theft, adultery of various kinds, deadly 

sins. Medhatithi quotes verses of Samvarta on Manu V. 88 and XI. 

116. The Mit. quotes him on prayascitta and a£auca ( Yaj. III. 6, 

17, 19 etc.). Apararka had a large work before him and quotes about 

200 verses.

A few of the views of Saihvarta on topics of vyavahara may be 
noted here. According to him oral testimony when in opposition 
to writing was to be discarded. 4 ** This is in striking agreement with 
section 92 of the Indian Evidence Act. He says that if houses and 
fields are being enjoyed ( by one person as against another ) when the 
king is there ( i. e. when the central government is strong and there 
is no anarchy), then it is possession that counts and not mere writ- 
ing ( i. e. possession will be protected and not mere paper 
title without possession). 4 ** He lays down that no interest was to be 
allowed if not stipulated for in certain cases, viz., on strldhana 
( when used by the husband ), on interest, on deposit ( as long as 
it is not lost or deteriorated) and in suretyship. 494 He enumerates ten 
wrongs (aparadhas ) of which the king was to take cognisance suo 
motu without any private person's complaint, viz., restraint of the 
defendant (before judgment), obstruction of the public road, 
women conceiving in adultery, becoming rich without any ostensible 
means, destruction of a meeting-hal 1 and of trees and crops, kidnapping 
of maidens, sinning Brahmanas, champerty and maintenance, 
destruction of the roads where tolls are to be paid, the danger of 
robbers, rape, injury to cows and Brahmanas. 495 He prescribed that 
disputes were not be investigated on the full moon and new moon 
day, and on the 14th and 8th tithis.

844 History qf Dharmatastro 

In Jivananda's collection (part I, pp. 584-603) and in the 
AnandaSrama collection ( pp. 41 1-424 ) there is a smrti of Samvarta 
in 227 and 230 verses respectively. It purports to have been declared 
to Vamadeva and other sages by Samvarta. Its main contents are : — 
that is the religious country where the black deer roam about, rules 
of conduct for a Brahmacarin, praya&ittas for various lapses on the 
part of a student, duties of householder, eulogy of liberality, duties of 
forest hermit and samnyasin, prayascittas for various sins and actions. 
Samvarta is sometimes cited as an authority ( verses 38, 123 ). He 
recommends the marriages of girls at the age of eight (verse 67) 
and condemns marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter (verse 157). 

InafewMss. (e.g. I. O. cat. No. 1367) the Samvartasmjti 
comprised is different from the printed Samvarta. 

The printed smrti appears to be an epitome of a portion of the 
original smrti of samvarta. Many of the verses in the primed texts 
are found in Apararka. For example Apararka p. 49= Samvarta 
verse 6 ; Apararka p. 693*=Sariivarta verses 107-108; Apararka p. 
1053 = Samvarta verses 111-113 ; Apararka p. 1094 (eight verses 
out of which five )= Samvarta verses 130-134. The pada of 
Samvarta which ViSvarupa quotes ( ardhastamitabhaskaram ) on 
Yaj. I. 25 occurs in verse 6 of the printed text. This shows that 
the printed smrti preserves very ancient material, the authenticity 
of which is vouched for by so early a writer as ViSvarupa. 

The Mit. quotes a Brhat-Samvarta ( on Yaj. III. 265, 288 ). 

A Svalpa-Saihvarta is quoted in Harinatha's Smrtisara, 

56. Hanla 

The verse quotations from Harita on topics of vyavahara deserve 
some treatment. He defines vyavahara as that whereby the recovery 
of one's own wealth and the avoidance of (doing) the duties peculiar 
to another ( caste or class ) are effected in due course of law. 496 He 
further says that that judicial proceeding is proper which is based 
on the dictates of dharma&stra and arthasastra, which is in conform- 
ity with the usages of respectable people and which is free from

fraud. 497 Harlta calls upon the king to know the Sastras, the duties 
of the varnas and of the lowest castes.*** He like Narada said that 
vyavahara had four aspects, each succeeding one prevailing against 
the preceding one 499 , viz., dharma, vyavahara, caritra, nrpajfia. 
He attached the greatest importance tp writing and said that a 
transaction consigned to writing is effective even after great lapse of 
time and that he who has a writing in his hands is entitled to 
possession ( probably in cases of mortgages and pledges).* 00 He lays 
down very elaborate rules about the requisites and defects of plaints, 
about summoning the defendant, about the contents, faults and kinds 
of the defendant's reply, and about the burden of proof.* 01 He 
protects long possession of property even if it originated without 
title provided it had lasted for three generations. 501 He says that title 
is the decisive factor as to various kinds gf possession, viz., when 
possession is forcibly taken by soldiers and freebooters, when a thing 
is stolen or kept concealed, when it was delivered through affection 
and friendship or when it was lent on hire, or when it was handed over 
for wearing or safe custody or was borrowed through friendship. *°* 
To illustrate the relation of title and possession he uses a very apt 
figure, viz. just as a branch cannot be seen expanding in the sky 
unless it is supported by the roots, so title is the root and possession

is its offshoot. According to him sureties are of five kinds, w abhaya 
(for keeping the peace), pratyaya (for confidence), dana 
( return of money or carrying out one's obligations ), upasth&na 
( return of money lent on pledge ) and darsana (for appearance). 
He prescribed an absolute tutelage for women as regards the giving 
away of the husband's wealth and allowed only maintenance to a 
young widow of improper conduct, s°s But Harita was humane in his 
treatment of even erring wives. He does not allow a husband to cast 
adrift an adulterous wife and prescribes that she should be given 
food to keep body and soul together and bare clothes. *° 6 

It appears from the above that Harita the jurist must have 
flourished nearly at the same time as Brhaspati and Katyayana, i. e, 
between 400 and 700 A. D. 

57. Commentaries and Nibandhas (digests) 

The literature on Dharmasastra falls into three well-marked but 
somewhat over-lapping periods. The first period is that of the ancient 
dharmasutras and of the Manusmrti. It is a period dating from at 
least the 6th century B. C. to the beginnings of the Christian era. 
Next comes the period when most of the versified smrtis were 
composed and it ranges from the first centuries of the Christain era 
to about 800 A. D. The third period is that of the commentators and 
the writers of digests. This covers over a thousand years from 
about the 7th century to 1800 A. D. The first part of this last 
period was the golden era of famous commentators. Commentaries 
on smrti works continued to be written almost to the end erf this 
period, e . g. Nandapandita wrote the commentary called Vaijayanti 
on the Visnudharmasutra in the 17th century. But the general 
tendency from the 12th century onwards was to write works not 
professing to be commentaries on a particular smrti, but works that 
were in the nature of digests containing a synthesis of all the 
dicta of smrti writers on topics of dharma. Examples of this class

of works are the Kalpataru, the Smrticandrika, the Caturvarga- 
cintamagi, the Ratnakaras of Caii4e£vara. Even when in the 
earlier part of this period writers professed to compose only 
commentaries on particular works, they adopted the style of digests 
trying to introduce order out of a chaotic mass of Smjti dicta and 
explaining away apparent contradictions. For example, Visvarupa's 
commentary (in the acara and prayascitta sections), the Mitaksara 
and Apararka's work, though professing to be commentaries on 
Yajnavalkya, are really in the nature of digests. In fact there is no 
hard and fast line of demarcation between a tika and a nibandha 
( digest ). Vijnanesvara is described by the Dvaitanirnaya of Sankara- 
bhafta as the most eminent of all writers of nibandhas. Therefore, 
though it is usual to speak of the third period as one of commentators 
and nibandhakaras, there is no necessity in this work to observe any 
sharp line of distinction between the two. In the following pages 
a few prominent and typical commentators and nibandhakaras who 
have written on all or most of the branches of dharmasastra and 
whose works have attained classical rank will be dealt with in 
chronological order as far as that can be done with any accuracy. 

58. Asahaya 

Dr. Jolly in his edition of the Naradasmrti (B. I. series) has 
incorporated a portion of the bhasya of Asahaya as revised by 
Kalyanabhatta. Even this revised version comes up to only verse 21 
of the fifth title abhynpetya-aiu$rfif&. The exact relation of Kalyana- 
bhatta's labours to the original hha$ya cannot be accurately gauged 
from the opening* ? words 'finding that the Ndradabhdsya composed 
by Asahaya was spoilt ( bhrajta ) by bad scribes, Kalyana composes 
this after revising the ancient one'. The colophon at the end of the 
first chapter of the Vyavaharamatrka says that Kalyanabhatta revised 
the bhasya of Asahaya at the encouragement of KeSavabhatta.* 08 
Kalyanabhafta seems to have taken great liberties with the text of the 
original bhasya. On p. 9 verse 1 5 ( raja satpuru§ah sabhyab 
sastram ga^akalekhakau ), the comment on &stra is 'Manu-Narada-

ViSvarupatmakam\ If Visvarupa named here be identical with the 
the ViivarQpa who commented on Yaj. (as is almost certain ), this 
passage could not have occurred in Asahaya's bha$ya. Visvarflpa, in 
commenting on Yaj. III. 263-64,[mentions; Asahaya by name and 
cites his explanation of a sQtra of Gautama (22. 13). The name 
Kalyanabhafta frequently occurs in the printed commentary itself 
(p. 81, 86, 89)."" 

In the I. O. ms. there is a salutation to Siva and Gai.iesa at the 
beginning. There is a ms. of the Naradiyabhasya as printed by Dr. 
Jolly in the Deccan College collection (No. 27 of 1874-75). It 
does not contain the first folio and curiously enough it ends just 
where the printed text stops. Dr. Jolly omits a few lengthy 
passages occurring in the ms. and generally indicates such omissions 
by dots. In a few cases Dr. Jolly omits only a word or two for no 
apparent reason, e. g. on p. 8 (folio 7b of No. 27 of 1 874-7 5 ) he 
omits the wotd 'paramasamrddhya' after 'vyavaharah' and before 
c catur^am-api varrianam\ 

The Haralata of Aniruddha who was the guru of king Ballala- 
sena of Bengal the author of Adbhutasagara (about 1168A. D. ) 
tells us that Asahaya composed a bhasya on the Gautamadharma- 
stttra.* 10 Visvarupa also cites, as said above, Asahaya's explanation 
of a satra of Gautama. 

It appears that Asahaya probably wrote a commentary on the 
Manusmrti also. A passage of the Sarasvativilasa 51 ' says that 
partition of dharma was approved of by smjtikaras like Manu,

Yajnavalkya, by their commentators, viz. Asahaya, Medhatithi, 
Vijfianesvara and Apararka and by writers of nibandhas, viz. the 
author of the Candrika and others. Here the order in which the com- 
mentators are named requires that Asahaya like Medhatithi was known 
to be a commentator of Manu. This conclusion is to some extent 
corroborated by the fact that the Vivadaratnakara> 12 quotes with 
reference to Manu 9. 182 the w r ords of Asahaya thereon. On Manu 
8. 156 Medhatithi quotes the opinion of Asahaya. 513 

The foregoing establishes that Asahaya composed bhasyas 
on the Gautamadharmasutra, on the Manusmrti and on Narada. 
When the Smrticandrika* 1 * refers to a bhasya of Narada it is 
most probably referring to Asahaya. In the Mit. ( on Yaj. II. 124) 
the opinion of Asahaya and Medhatithi on the right of an unmarried 
sister to receive one-fourth as provision for her marriage from her 
brothers is preferred to that of Bharuci.* 1 * This seems to be rather 
a reference to Asahaya's commentary on Manu (9. 118 ) which 
contains a rule similar to Yaj. ( II. 124 ), while Narada contains no 
such rule about a fourth share. It is a strange irony of fate that the

very name of Asahaya who is profusely quoted by the Sarasvati- 
vilasa in the first half of the sixteenth century was forgotten by 
later writers, so much so that the Balarhbhaui understands the word 
Asahaya ( in note 515 above) as an attribute of Medhatithi in the 
sense of ( peerless \ 

As Visvarupa and Medhatithi both name Asahaya, his lowest limit 
is about 750 A. D. How much earlier he flourished it is difficult 
to say. He can hardly be earlier than the 6th century. In the com. 
on Narada ( p. 48 ) there is a story from Pataliputra about the 
repayment of a debt by sons, grandsons and great-grandsons. It 
has been argued ( Calcutta Law Journal, vol. 17 p. 59 ) that, as 
Pataliputra was a deserted city in the middle of the 7th century 
and as the reference shows that Pataliputra was a living and flourish- 
ing city, Asahaya must have lived long before the 7th century. 
But as the very authenticity of the text of the bhasya is doubtful 
owing to the drastic 'revision' of Kalyanabhatta, such a conclusion 
is extremely hazardous. In the ms. of the bhasya other places such 
as Vafapadraka (probably modern Baroda), Avavadu and Samvaduka 
are mentioned. There is nothing to show that the author was 
either a native of or had a first-hand knowledge of Pataliputra. 
He might have been relying on traditions when he gave the story. 
Dr. Jolly not being aware of the express mention of Asahaya by 
Medhatithi argued that he flourished earlier than Medhatithi (Tagore 
Law Lectures p. 5 ; S. B. E. vol. 25 p. VII) on the ground that the 
Mit. and the Sarasvativilasa always place Asahaya before Medhatithi 
whenever authorities on vyavahara are enumerated. Dr. Jolly's 
conclusion is right as shown above, but his reasoning is faulty. 
There is hardly anything of chronology in the order in which 
authors are named, since we find that the Sarasvativilasa* 16 names 
Vijnane^vara even before Asahaya, though the former flourished 
centuries after the latter. 

Some of the views attributed to Asahaya may be quoted here. 
The definition of d&ya ( heritage ) given by the Mit. was identical 
with Asahaya's.* 1 ? Asahaya explained the dictum of U&nas that

fields were impartible by taking it to refer to the son of a Brahmana 
from a Ksatriya wife, who does not participate in land gifted to a 
Brahmaga.* 18 The Mit. on Yaj. II. 119 takes the same view. 
AsahSya held that as regards succession to the Sulka of a woman 
even step-brothers should be given something, though the major 
portion would go to the full brothers, w According to Asahaya, the 
wealth of a childless Brahmana went to the teacher, then to the 
teacher's son, then to the teacher's widow, the pupil, pupil's son, 
pupil's widow (one after another ) and then to the fellow-student. J 20 
The Vivadaratnakara* 21 (p. 578) quotes the PrakaSaas referring to the 
views ot Asahaya and Medhatithi on Manu IX. 1 98 that the special rule 
of Manu applies to all the stndhana belonging to a Ksatriya woman 
who has a brahman! co-wife. The Vivadaratnakara*" quotes a verse 
of Narada about m&fa and a verse of the bhasyakara thereon. It 
probably refers to Asahaya's bhasya. 

59. Bhartryajna 

This seems to have been a very ancient commentator. 
Medhatithi 523 in his bhasya on Manu 8. 3 says 'other explanations 
have been well brought out by Bhartryajna and they should be 
understood from his work'. Trikanda-Mandana (who flourished 
before xzoo A.|D.)in hisApastambasutradhvanitartha-karikas 2 *(1. 41)

memory the text of the Veda had the privilege (the adhikara) of 
consecrating the sacred fires, though he may be innocent of the 
meaning of the Vedic texts. From Ananta's bhasya it appears that 
Bhartryajna composed a bhasya on the Katyayanasrautasutra which 
had been lost ( utsanna ) in the former's day. From Gad&dhara's 
comments on the Paraskara grhyasutra it appears that Bhartryajna 
commented on Paraskara. 525 The Grhastharatnakara of Cande- 
Svara quotes Bhartryajna's explanation of the word sathvihhaga 
occurring in Gautamadharmasutra ( 10. 39 'svaml riktha-kraya-sam- 
vibhaga-parigrahadhigamesu)'. 526 The NityScarapradipa (B. I. series) 
after quoting Gautamadharmasutra ( 11. 29 varnasramah svadhar- 
manisthah &c. ) cites the comment of Bhartryajna 52 ? on the word 
tac-chefeya occurring in that sutra. Therefore it appears probable that 
Bhartryajna like Asahaya was an ancient commentator of the 
Gautamadharmasutra. The Grhastharatnakara, after quoting from 
Vasistha ( 17. 1 ) and Visnu the well-known verse of the Aitareya- 
brahmana (rnam-asmin sam-nayati) cites the explanation of Bhartr- 
yajna as to the word ' jatasya ' occurring therein. 528 

Since Bhartryajna is quoted by Medhatithi who also mentions 
Asahaya but not Visvarupa, it follows that Bhartryajna must have 
flourished before 800 A. D. and was probably a contemporary of 
or slightly later than Asahaya. 

60. Visvarupa 

The commentary of Visvarfipa called Balakiida on the Yajna- 
valkya-smrti has been recently published in two parts by M.M.T. 
Ganapati Sastri in the Trivandrnm Sanskrit Series. The Mit. states 
in the introductory verses that the dicta of Yaj. were expanded by

the voluminous or ample ( vikatA ) explanations of VisvarGpa. In 
commenting on Yaj. I. 81 the Mit. tells us that VisvarQpa looked 
upon the words of Yaj. I. 79 ( tasmin yugmasu samviset) as a 
niyatna. In Visvarupa's commentary on Yaj. I. 80 ( evarh gacchan 
&c. ) we do find that the verse of Yaj. and similar passages of 
Manu ( 3. 45 ), Vasisfhaand Gautama ( 5. 1 ) are understood to 
contain a niyama and not a parisathkhya.* 2 * On Yaj. III. 24 the Mit. 
informs us that Visvarupa, Medhatithi and Dharesvara looked upon 
certain texts of RsyasrAga on aiatica as in conflict with well-known 
smytisand discarded them. Mr. S. Sitaram &astri published ( in 
1900 at Madras) the text and translation of Visvarupa's comment 
on inheritance and Mr. Setlur also published the vyavahara section. 
In the following pages the Trivandrum edition is relied on. 

The printed com. of Visvarupa on the vyavahara section is 
extremely meagre and scarcely merits the epithet vikata applied to 
it by the Mit. But the comment of Visvarupa on the Ocara and 
pr&yaicitta sections is truly voluminous and compares favourably 
with the Mit. The style of Visvarupa is simple and forcible and 
resembles that of the great &ankaracarya. He quotes profusely from 
Vedic works, mentions the Carakas and Vajasaneyins(on Yaj 1. 32), 
the Kathaka ( on Yaj. III. 237 and 243 ) and very often supports his 
position by quotations from the Rgveda( e. g. on Yaj. II. 121 and 
206 ), the Brahmanas ( e. g. the Satapatha on Yaj. 1. 53 and III. 
257 ) and from the Upanisads ( e. g. on Yaj. II. 117, the well-known 
Chandogya passage about the ordeal for theft and on Yaj. I. 50 
Chandogya II. 23. 10 about the three branches of dharma ). He 
speaks of the pada-pdtha and the kramapalba as due to human agency 
( on Yaj. III. 242 ). He frequently quotes the Grhyasutras of 
Paraskara and less frequently those of Bharadvaja and Asvalayana. 
He cites a host of smrtikaras. 5 * Most of the quotations attributed to

154 History cf Dkarmottetra 

Svayarhbhu are found in the extant Manusmrti, but this is not the 
case with the quotations ascribed to Bhrgu ( vide p. 138 above). 
Most of the quotations from Brhaspati ( even on such topics as 
repayment of debts, sureties, the rights of Sudraputra ) are in prose, 
only a few being in verse ( e. g. a verse about ordeals on Yaj. II. 
117, a verse about the method of partition on Yaj. II. 153). It 
appears therefore that Visvarftpa either knew a work of Brhaspati 
in prose on artha&stra in which occurred a few verses or he had 
before him a prose work of Brhaspati and a versified smrti of Brhas- 
pati, both of which he regarded as the compositions of the same 
author. He quotes a verse ( on Yaj. I. 328 ) from Vi&laksa, a well* 
known writer on politics quoted even by Kautilya. He refers to 
the artha&stra of Usanas along with that of Brhaspati. Kautilya is 
nowhere quoted by name. The learned editor of Visvarupa 
thinks ( Intro, p. V ) that Visvarupa took Brhaspati and Vi&laksa 
as ar$a writers long anterior to Yaj. and therefore used their dicta to 
elucidate and support Yaj., while he omits Kautilya because he 
thought Kautilya to be posterior to Yaj. This argument contains 
several fallacies. In the first place it is wrong because Visvarupa 
quotes verses from Narada and Katyayana to supplement Yaj. 
There is nothing to show that Visvarupa regarded Narada and Katya- 
yana also as anterior to Yaj. and we have seen above that they are 
several centuries later than the smrti of Yaj. Moreover Kautilya 
himself looked upon both Brhaspati and Visalaksa as high autho- 
rities and so Visvarupa might have quoted them rather than 
Kautilya. Even taking the latest date assigned to Kautilya ( about 
3rd century A. D. ), he flourished several centuries before Viivarupa. 
It is impossible to believe that Visvarupa was in possession of the 
exact chronological relation of Yaj. and Kautilya. Many scholars, 
besides, place Kautilya's work centuries before Yaj. It appears, 
however, that Visvarupa had the work of Kautilya before him. On 
Yaj. I. 307 he speaks of ministers tested by the four allurements 
( upadha ) of dhartna, artha, katna and bhay a. This is an echo of 
Kautilya ( I- 10 ). On Yaj I. 343 V& refers to the view of some 
that a march should be made when neighbouring chiefs are over- 
whelmed in calamities." 1 This is the view of Kautilya almost in

the same words. On Yaj. I. 341 Vis. speaks of the manifold aspects 
of the work of a minister, some words of his comment being almost 
identical with Kaufilya's. 

ViSvarupa's work is thoroughly saturated with the lore of the 
Paramimamsa. He quotes Jaimini by name ( on Yaj. I. 225 
where Jaimini VI. 8. 15 is quoted ). Curiously enough he applies 
the term nyaya to Mimamsa. He takes ' nyaya-mimamsa ' in Yaj. 
I. 3 as one vidya, while he notes that others explain nyaya as the 
system of logic propounded by Aksapada. He quotes the sutras 
of Jaimini as those of Yaj nikas who know nyaya ( e. g. on Yaj. I. 
53 he quotes Jaimini I. 3. 16 and on Yaj I. 87 he quotes Jaimini 
VI. 8. 17 ). He applies the epithet naiyayika to a mimamsaka like 
Sahara and speaks of the mimamsakas as nyayavidah.™* He mentions 
the Sabarbhasya by name ( on Yaj. III. 243 ) and in several places 
quotes the very words of Sahara ( e. g. on Yaj. III. 181 ).*33 He 
quotes the slokavartika of Kumarila( I. 12 the verse 'sarvasyaiva 
hi &c. ) in his introductory remarks. In his comment on Yaj. I. 7 
he cites over fifty verses in the nature of karikas dealing with the 
relation of sruti and smrti and kindred topics. These verses are 
his own composition, as in one of them he assures us that a certain 
point will be dealt with by him in detail in the section onsraddha.sn 
In interspersing his commentary with karikas of his own and in 
their style and pithiness he greatly resembles Kumarila. Through- 
out his work he relies upon mimamsa maxims and methods of

discussion. For example, on Yaj. I. 4-5 he discusses the rule oi 
Jaimini II. 4. 8 ff ( about c sarvasakhapratyayam ekarh karma ' ) in 
its application tosmrtis ; on Yaj. I. 225 he relies upon the position 
that words like yava and varclha are to be taken as employed in the 
Vedas in the same sense in which ii^las use them ( vide Jaimini 
I- 3- 9 ) l on Yaj. II. 144 he speaks of wealth ( dravya ) being 
purusartba, where he alludes to the well-known distinction between 
kratvartha and purufdrtha, the subject of Jai mini's 4th chap. His 
commentary on Yaj. Ill 212, 237, 262 are fine examples of hisg 
superb skill in the interpretation and reconciliation of apparently! 
conflicting texts. , 

Though Visvarupa was a past master in Purvamimariisa lore, 
his philosophical, views seem to have been identical with those of 
the great Sankara. According to him, mokfa results from correct 
knowledge alone and the whole samsara is due to avidy&.w He 
quotes anonymously one of Gaudapada's karikas** 6 (HI. 5 ) on Yaj. 
III. 134. 

He speaks on Yaj. III. 103 of Narada who knew the Veda of 
music ( gitivedavid ), of purana ( on III. 175 ), and quotes verses 
( on Yaj. III. 85 ) from an abhidhanakosa ( lexicon ) and from a 
Namaratnamala ( on III. 266 ). He speaks of the sloka of Bhiksa- 
jana (on III. 66). He is in this probably referring to the Bhiksa- 
tanakavya, *" which is mentioned by the Sahityadarpana. Among 
commentators he mentions Asahaya's bhasya on Gautama by name 
( on Yaj. III. 263 ). On Yaj. III. 256 he explains Mleccha as 
pulindas and Tdjikas ( i. e. Arabs ).

It has been shown above (834 pp. 169-170) how ViSvarupa's text 
of Yaj. varied in some respects from that of the Mit. ; how he fre- 
quently refers to the views of commentators of Yaj. earlier than 
himself ( in the words ' apare, ' ' anye ' ), how he proposes several 
explanations of the same words in several cases. 

Dr. Jolly (Journal of Indian History 1924, pp. 7-8) says that the 
citations of Vi£. in the Smrticandrika about his having refuted the 
views of DhareSvara cannot be traced in the printed Balakrida, as 
also the reference to Vi5. in the Mit. on Yaj. I. 81 and II. 135. It has 
been shown above (note 529) that the printed Vis on Yaj. I. 80 does 
contain the view attributed to it by the Mit. As regards the Mit. 
on Yaj. II. 135 it has to be noted that the Mit. does not mention 
ViS. by name there, but only speaks of c bhagavan acarya," 8 * which 
words are interpreted by the Subodhini and the Balambhattias referr- 
ing to ViSvarGpa. It is true that the printed Vis. does not contain 
in so many words the explanation attributed by the Mit. to 
' bhagavan acarya. ' But it is worth considering that in the printed 
Vis. the two quotations from Manu and Sarikha do occur and are 
put in the mouth of an objector and are explained away in a way 
somewhat similar to* that put forth in the Mit."' As regards the 
passages of the Smrticandrika, the matter requires careful examina- 
tion. The Smrticandrika ( II. p. 294 Gharpure's ed. ) says that 
according to the Samgrahakara a widow was allowed to succeed to 
her sonless husband's wealth if she submitted to niyoga, that the

same was the view of Dharesvara and that VisvarOpa refuted the 
view of Dharesvara. In no place does the printed Vis. name 
Dharesvara. The words of the Smrticandrika are not to be 
taken literally. It will be shown below that the author, Devai?na- 
bhatfa, flourished about 1200 A. D., while Dharesvara flourished 
between 1000-1050 A. D. Devagiia had no correct idea 
of their relative chronological position. It has been shown above 
(p. 249) how though Asahaya is named by the Mit., the Sarasvati- 
vilasa very often says that Asahaya does not like ( or tolerate ) the 
views of Vijiianesvara. Similarly the same work ( para 392 ) says 
that Dharesvara and Devasvamin do not tolerate the view of Vijiia- 
nesvara, but Dharesvara is one of the predecessors of Vij. actually 
named by him. So all that the Smrticandrika means is that 
Dharesvara and Visvarupa differed in their views on the particular 
points mentioned by it. The word patni is taken by Vis. to mean 
a widow who is pregnant at the* time of her husband's death and 
quotes the sutras of Vasistha and Gautama in support of his view 
as jhapaka$. So this view entirely differs from the view of Dhare- 
svara that the widow of a sonless person succeeds if she submits to 
niyoga. The Smrticandrika ( II. p. 300 ) says that the Samgraha- 
kara placed the father's mother immediately after the mother and 
before the father, that the Saihgrahakara relied on the same argu- 
ments that were employed by Dharesvara and that Visvarupa and 
others refuted those arguments. The passage in the printed Vi£. 
is somewhat corrupt in this place. Vis. does place the mother before 
the father on the ground of the word mata occurring first when the 
word € pitarau ' or the compound ' tn&tapitarau 9 is expanded. The 
comment does mention the verse of Manu (9.217) about the 
grandmother, but it makes no clear sense, as it stands. 540 For the 
reason given above Rai Bahadur M. M. Chakravarti ( JASB for 
1912, p. 345 and for 1915, p. 322) is not right when he places 
Visvarupa later than Bhojadeva because of the remarks of the Smrti- 
candrika. 

In the works of Jimutavahana ( viz. the Dayabhaga and the 
Vyavaharamatrka ), in the Smrticandrika, the Haralata, and other 
later works like the Sarasvativilasa, the views of Visvarupa are 
frequently cited and discussed. Several such citations have been

already examined by me ( JBBRAS for 1926, pp. 200-204 )• From 
considerations of space I do not repeat here the discussion of those 
passages. In the Grhastharatnakara^ 1 of Candesvara (D.C. No. 44 of 
1883-4, f° lio J 33 a ) the explanation of Visvarupacarya on Yaj. I. 135 
is cited, which does not exactly tally with the printed Vi$. 
Hemadri" 2 refers to Visvarupa's explanation given in his section 
on partition which does not occur in the printed text. The result 
of the examination of these citations is that the printed text of Vis. 
is in the main genuine, but that in a few cases ( particularly in the 
vyavahara section ) it is corrupt or deficient. 

Though Vis. holds the same view as the Mit. that ownership 
does not for the first time arise on partition but that partition takes 
place of what is already ( jointly ) owned, yet on numerous points 
the two disagree. A few of them may be set out here. 

( 1 ) Vi$. allows (on Yaj. II. 118) the father unrestricted 
freedom of distribution of property among his sons during his life- 
time, while the Mit. expressly says that this power of unequal dis- 
tribution is restricted to self-acquired property. 

( 2 ) Vi£. ( on Yaj. II. 119 ) allows a share of property to the 
widows of predeceased sons and grandsons of a man when a parti- 
tion takes place during his lifetime. The Mit. restricts the words 
1 patnyafet ' to the father's own wives when he effects a partition 
during his lifetime. 

( 3 ) Vi£. connects the words r without detriment to the paternal 
estate* (in Yaj. II. 122) with the words 'whatever else is 
acquired by himself ' and not with ' maitra' ( gifts from a friend ) 
and € audvahika * ( gifts on marriage ), while the Mit. connects the 
half verse 'whatever else is acquired by the man himself without

detriment to the paternal estate ' as a qualifying clause to the next 
half verse and to another verse ' kramad abhyagatam &c. ' In the 
Mit. the two verses * pitfdravyavirodhena &c. ' and € kramad &c. ' occur 
consecutively, while in Vi£. they are separated by three verses and 
V& takes the verse € kramad * &c. as referring to the re-opening of 
a partition for a son born after partition. 

( 4 ) Vis. allows niyoga only to ttidras in general and to ksatriya 
kings in case of danger of extinction of line ( vide com. on Yaj. I. 
69 and II. 131 ), while Mit. forbids niyoga in general and holds the 
texts speaking of it as applicable to a girl who is only betrothed and 
not married. 

( 5 ) Vi£. appears to allow one share out of ten to the son of 
a sfidra wife from a brahmana without restriction of any kind, while 
Mit. restricts the share to estates other than land acquired by gift. 

( 6 ) ViS. interprets the expression € half share ' ( in Yaj. II. 
138) with reference to the illegitimate son of a iadra as meaning 
'some portion, not necessarily exactly half/ while Mit. interprets 
it literally. 

( 7 ) Vi£. allows a widow to succeed to her husband if she is 
pregnant at his death, while Mit. allows a widow to succeed without 
any restriction except that of chastity. 

( 8 ) Vii. restricts the word € duhitarah 'in € patni duhitaras- 
caiva* (Yaj. II. 138 )to/wfn'fo only and so does not allow all 
daughters whatever to succeed, while Mit. does not introduce any 
such qualification. 

( 9 ) Vii. reads ' anyodaryasya samsrsfi ' for anyodaryastu &c. 9 
and 'sodaro ' for ' sarhsrsfo ' in Yaj. II. 143 and his interpretation of 
the verse is entirely different from that of the Mit. 

( 10 ) ViS. reads ' adhivedanikam caiva ' for ' adhivedanikadyaih 
ca ' of Mit. and holds thaxbandbudatta, iulka and anvOdhcydkastridbana 
of a childless woman goes on her death to her full brother ; while 
Mit. connects these three with the preceding verse and takes the 
half verse € atitayam ' as laying down a general rule of succession 
to stridbana of all kinds and interprets ' bapdhavafr 9 as meaning 
' husband and the rest \ 

( xx ) V& takes the vexse € adhivinna-striyai f &c. ( on Yaj. H-

supersession allowed by the texts ; while Mit. does not introduce 
any such qualification. 

As Vi&varttpa quotes Rumania's Slokavartika and is mentioned 
by the Mit. as an authoritative commentator it follows that he 
flourished between 750 A. D. and 1000 A. D. A greater approxi- 
mation as to the date of Vi£varupa can be made, if the identity of 
ViSvarGpa with Suresvara be held established. Suresvara, as he 
himself tells us in theNaiskarmyasiddhi, theTaittiriyopanisadbhasya- 
vartika and other works, was a pupil of the great Saftkaracarya 
whose generally accepted period is 788-820 A. D. Madhavacarya 
in several works of his quotes as Visvarupa's passages from the well- 
known works of Suresvara. For example, the ParaSara-Madhaviya 
( vol. I, part I, p. 57 ) quotes a karika of Suresvara as that of Vi£va- 
rupacarya.54j I n the Vivaranaprameyasarhgraha (Vizianagaram series 
p. 92 ) also Madhava quotes a verse from the Brhadaranyakopanisad- 
bhasya-vartika as Visvarupa's.*** In the Purusarthaprabodha^s f 
Brahmananda-bharatI ( ms. in Bhau Daji collection, Bombay ) 
composed in 1476 ( probably of the Saka era ) the author speaks of 
the Naiskarmyasiddhi as a work of ViSvarupa. In the Sariik§epa- 
Saftkara-jaya VisvarQpa is said to be the author of the two vartikas 
on Satikara's bhasya.** 6 According to tradition embodied in the 
various lives of SaAkaia, the latter had four pupils, Suresvara, Padma- 
pada, Totaka and Hastamalaka. Several works mention Viivarupa 
as one of the four pupils and omit the name Suresvara. For 
example, in the Dvadasa-vakya-vivarana of Gopala ( Aufrecht's Oxf. 
cat, No.'S57, p. 227 b ) the four pupils of SaAkara are named as 
Visvarftpa, Padmanabha, Totaka and Hastamalaka. In the Mana- 
sollasa-vrttanta-vilasa of Ramatirtha we are expressly told that Sure-

p. 257). 



iMt Bbtory qf bharmailUlra 

Svara is another name of ViSvarOpa, a pupil of Saftkara ( vide Mitta's 
Notices vol. V, No. 1763, p. 82). In the Saptasutra-sarhnyasapaddhati 
( Mitra's Notices, vol. VI, p. 296 ) the four pupils are said to eb 
SvarupScarya, Padmacarya, Tbfaka and Pjthvidhara. The Guru- 
vamsakavya(Vanivilas ed.) identifies Suresvara and Vi£varupa(II.59) 
and makes him a pupil of Kumarila and &afikara. It may therefore be 
held as fairly established that Visvarupa and Suresvara are identical. 
Some corroboration is afforded by the fact that ViSvarupa quotes 
Gaudapada the ' paramaguru ' of Satikara and holds the same philo- 
sophical views as those of Sankara. Just as Visvarupa quotes 
Rumania's Slokavartika, Suresvara also in his Taittiriyopanisad- 
bha$ya-vartika quotes a karika of Kumarila and styles the latter 
Mimamsakam-manya. 54 ? This shows that Suresvara treated Kumarila 
with scant respect, which seems unlikely if he was at any time 
Rumania's pupil, Vifivarupa in his introduction** 8 performs an 
obeisance to the Sun, the great serpent ( Sesa ), Tilaksvamin and 
Vinayaka. The Bhamati of Vacaspati-misra has a similar salutation. 
Vacaspati-misra wrote his Nyayasuci-nibandha in 841-42 A. D. i. e. 
he was almost a contemporary of Satikara and his pupils. The 
learned editor of ViS. tells us that in a commentary on Vis. called 
Vacanamala Suresvara is bracketed with Manu and Yogiivara 
( Yajnavalkya ) as an expounder of Sastra (i.e. dharmasastra)."* 
Therefore that commentator looked upon Vis. and Suresvara as 
identical. From all these several considerations it follows that

Vi£varfipa flourished about 800-825 A. D. But this problem presents 
further difficulties. The mutual relations of Suresvara, Bhavabhuti, 
Umbeka and Mapdana are a great puzzle. I have dealt with this 
question in JBBRAS for 1928, pp. 289-293. The conclusions arrived 
at there are that Mandana's literary activity lies between 690-710, 
that of Umbeka between 700-730 and Suresvara's between 810-840 
A. D. and that Umbeka and Bhavabhuti are identical, but that 
Mandana and Suresvara are separated by about 100 years. 

Dr. Jolly has brought together in the Journal of Indian History 
(vol. III. pp. 1-27) some valuable information about ViSvarupa. 

In several later works a digest called Visvarupa-nibandha is 
frequently cited. That appears to be the composition of another 
Visvarupa altogether. For example, the san-ijavati-$raddha-nirnaya 
of§ivabhatta( which is later than 1650 A. D. ) tells us that Visva- 
rupacarya composed a vivarapa ( commentary ) on the £raddha- 
kalika.ss° The Krtyacintamanl of Sivarama (D. C. No. 221 of 1879 ) 
quotes several" 1 verses from Visvarupanibandha on Sapirida relation- 
ship in marriage, which are not found in the Balakrida, but which 
agree remarkably with the words of the Mit. onYaj. I. 53. The 
Varsakriyakaumudi (pp. 378, 380) mentions Visvarupa-nibandha 
and quotes two verses cited therein. The Tithi-niriiaya-sarva- 
samuccaya ( later than 1450 A. D. ) quotes certain ktirikds of Visva- 
r0paonthei8 varieties of Ekadasi. J > 2 The Kalanirnayasiddhanta- 
vyakhya (composed in 1653 A. D. ) quotes certain verses of 
Visvarupa on the question of the disposal of food prepared for a 
marriage when a period of impurity on death supervenes."* The

Nirnayasindhu also quotes verses of ViSvarupa. From these data 
it follows that a Vi&rarfipa composed a commentary on Sraddha- 
kalika and also wrote a digest on matters of acara and other topics 
ofdharma in prose and verse. Raghunandana in his Udvahatattva 
( ed. by Jivananda, p. 116 ) names a Visvarfipa-samuccaya. It is 
likely that it is the same as ViSvarupa-nibandha. 

61. Bharuci. 

The Mit. on Yaj. ( I. 81 ) says that Bharuci like Viivarapa held 
the view that the rule ' jtau bharyam gacchet * was a niyama and 
not a parisathkbya. On Yaj. II 124 the Mit. says that the explana- 
tion of ' the fourth share ' to be given to unmarried sisters offered 
by Asahaya and Medhatithi was the proper one and not that of 
Bharuci. The Parasaramadhaviya" 4 and the Sarasvativilasa ( para 
133 ) inform us that Bharuci was of opinion that unmarried sisters 
were only entitled to a provision for their marriage and were not 
entitled to a fourth share. 

Bharuci, being mentioned by the Mit., is certainly older than 
1050 A. D. Ramanujacarya in his Vedarthasamgraha (reprint from 
the Pandit, ed. of 1924, p. 154 ) mentions six Ocdryas that preceded 
him as expounders of the Visisfadvaita system, viz. Bodhayana, 
Taftka, Dramida, Guhadeva, Kapardin and Bharuci. Similarly 
the Yatindramatadipika 555 of Srinivasadasa (Anandasrama ed. ) 
enumerates ( p. 2 ) a host of teachers as the predecessors of Rama- 
nujacarya in propounding the Visistadvaita system. Vyasa is the 
reputed author of the Vedamasutras, Bodhayana is said to have com* 
posed a vftti on the Vedanta-sutras, called Kjtakoti according to the 
Prapanca-hrdaya (p. 39, Trivandrum ed.). Taftkaand Brahmanandin 
are identical. Dramida is credited with the authorship of a bb&tya on 
the Vedanta-sutras ( which is quoted by Ramanuja in his bhasya on 
II. 2. 3 ). Nathamuni is said to have been the grand-father of 
Yamunamuni, who was born about 916 A. D. Ramanuja refers 
to him with great reverence as his teacher's teacher ( paranta-gurn, 
vide Vedartha-sarbgraha, p. 149 ) and is said to have been young

when Yamuna died ( vide J R A S for 191 5, p. 147 and I. A. for 
1 9°9f P* I2 9 )• It is therefore obvious that the teachers are arranged 
by the Yatindramatadipika in chronological order. Hence Bharuci, 
being placed earlier than even Dramida and Nathamuni, was com- 
paratively an ancient author and could not have flourished later 
than the , first half of the 9th century. Bharuci the jurist also 
flourished before 1050. It is difficult to believe that there were 
two famous writers of the same name nearly about the same time. 
Hence it may provisionally be held that Bharuci the writer on 
dharma&stra and Bharuci the Visistadvaita philosopher are identical. 
If this identity be accepted, then Bharuci the writer on dharmasastra 
becomes comparatively an early writer, being at least as old as 
Visvarupa. His views agree on several points with those of Visva- 
riipa, which is a circumstance that lends some corroboration to the 
date proposed for him. 

One interesting point about Bharuci deserves mention here. 
From numerous notices contained in the Sarasvatlvilasa it appears 
that Bharuci either commented upon the Visnudharmasutra or wrote 
some work in which he took great pains to incorporate explanations 
of several sutras of Visnu. For example, para 637 tells us that 
Bharuci explained the word ' bija ' occurring in a sutra of Visnu as 
*pinda\ ss6 In para 674 we are told that Bharuci explained the 
word c niskarana ' in a sutra of Visnu and that he held that a 
daughter's son has not to perform the sraddha of his maternal grand- 
father if the latter has a son. Sudarsanacarya in his comment upon 
Apastambagrhya ( 8. 21. 2 ) ascribes the same view to Bharuci and 
quotes the very words of Bharuci. 5 $7 Vide J B B R A S for 1925 
pp. 210-21 1 for further examples. There is nothing unnatural in 
Bharuci, the Visi§tadvaita philosopher, having composed a commen-

tary on the Visgudharfnastttra. The extant Viwudharmasmra 
contains doctrines peculiar to the Vi$i§tadvaita system such as the 
worship of Narayapa or Vasudeva, the four VyOhas of Vasudeva &c. 
If Bharuci was a Vi£i§tadvaitin he would naturally turn to the sfltra 
of Visgu as having the greatest claim on his attention. Many of 
the sutras of Vispu quoted in the Sarasvativilasa with the explana- 
tions of Bharuci are not found in the printed text of Vi§iju,on which 
Nandapandita commented in the first half of the 17th century. It 
appears that the Sarasvativilasa had before it a larger version of Vi?pu 
current in the south ( vide note 118, p. 70 above ). 

On scores of points there is divergence between the views of 
Bharuci and those of the Mit. Bharuci differed from the Mit. as to 
the definition of ddya and vibhaga, he allowed niyoga to childless 
widows, while the Mit. condemned it in the case of all widows ; 
Bharuci, like Visvarupa, did not mention sapratibandha and aprati- 
bandha daya ; Bharuci, like ViSvarupa, held that a coparcener who 
concealed some joint property was not guilty of theft, while the 
Mit. held that he was. Vide J B B R A S for 1925 pp. 21 1-13 for 
more examples and details. 

62. Srikara 

The Mit. on Yaj. II. 135 alludes to the ♦iew of Srikara and 
Others that the widow succeeded as heir to her deceased 
husband's estate if it was small. s* 8 The Smrtisara"? of Harinatha 
attributes the same view to Srikara and disapproves of it. On Yaj. 
II. 169 the Mit.* 6 ° cites the view of Srikara about that topic and dis- 
approves of it. Visvarupa also gives two explanations of that verse 
of Yaj., the first of which agrees with that of the Mit. and the 
second is akin to Srikara's.

0*. irtkara ttf 

The works of Jlmfltavihana ( viz. the Dayabhaga and the Vyava- 
hiramitrka ), the Smrticandriki and the Sarasvativilasa contain very 
interesting notices of §rlkara's views. Many of them were brought 
together by me inJBBRASfor 1925, pp. 213-215. Srikara like 
ViSvarfipa held the view that 'duhitarah* in Yaj. refers to the 
puttika, he allowed the parents of a childless person to succeed 
together at the same time. The Dayabhaga very severely criticizes 
the views of Ankara on the succession to re-united members, on 
vidyddham and on Yaj. II. 24 ( about enjoyment for 20 years ).**' 
Most of the views attributed to Ankara were also entertained by 
Visvarupa or are more antiquated than Visvarupa's. 

Srikara was probably a writer from Mithila and seems to have 
propounded the view of spiritual benefit as the criterion for judging 
superior rights of succession. The Smrtisara* 63 of Harinatha 
ascribes such a view to a Srikara-nibandha. 

Whether Snkara wrote a commentary on a smrti or a general 
digest ( nibandha ) it is difficult to say. The Smrticandrika* 6 * says 
that Sambhu, Srikara and Devasvamin compiled digests of smrtis 
and added their own explanations of them. The Smrtyarthasara* 6 * 
of &ridhara asserts in the introductory verses that Srikantha and 
Srikaracarya filled up the gaps in the smrtis that were scattered 
about ( by introducing order out of chaos ). Ankara's explanations 
of Yajnavalkya are frequently cited by the Mit., the Dayabhaga and 

561 Vide wjq^raf p. 47 where s$fj^ is the first of a host of writers who

others. But the Mit. does not connect Ankara's name with 
Yajnavalkya as a commentator, though Visvarupa is expressly so 
connected. It appears therefore more likely that Srikara wrote a 
digest of smrtis in which he paid particular attention to the expla- 
nation of the words of Yajnavalkya. The Rajanitiratnakara* 6 * of 
Candesvara quotes the views of Srikara on rajaniti, one of which is 
that the poor and helpless are entitled to a share of the royal wealth. 

Hemadri* 66 quotes the view of Srikara on Visnu and disapproves 
of the faults found therein by the author of the Pandita-paritosa. 

As Ankara is quoted by the Mit., he is certainly earlier than 1050 
A. D. As his views agree largely with ViSvarupa's, he may provi- 
sionally be regarded as nearly of the same period as ViSvarupa's. 
He cannot be earlier than Asahaya who is named both by Visvarflpa 
and Medhatithi, though both of them are silent about Ankara. 
Hence Srikara must be placed somewhere between 800 and 1050 
A. D. and probably flourished in the 9th century. 

This Srikara must be distinguished from another Srikara, the 
father of Srinatha. 

63. Medhatithi. 

Medhatithi is the author of an extensive and erudite commentary 
( bhasya ) on the Manusmrti. It is the oldest extant commentary 
on that smiti. The bhasya of Medhatithi was first published about 
forty years ago by Rao Saheb V. N. Mandlik in Bombay and recent- 
ly Mr. J. R. Gharpure of Bombay brought out an edition of 
Medhatithi which closely follows Mandlik's edition. A critical 
edition of the bhasya based upon all the available Mss. is a great 
desideratum. An English translation of the bhasya by M. M. Dr. Gan- 
ganath Jha is in progress and several parts have been published so far. 
In the following Mr. Gharpure's edition has been used. The bhasya 
as printed is corrupt in many places, particularly in the 8th, 9th and

1 2th adhydyas In Mr. Gharpure's edition there is no bhasya on 
verses 182-202 of the 9th chapter. 

Btthler in his learned and exhaustive Introduction to the Manu- 
smrti ( S. B. E. vol. 25 ) brings together a good deal of information 
about Medhatithi ( pp. cxviii-cxxvi .). In J B B R A S for 
1925 pp. 217-221 1 have offered criticisms on some of Bflhler's views 
and have given certain additional information. 

In several Mss. of the bhasya at the end of several adhy&yas occurs 
a verse s6 7 which says that a king named Madana, son of Saharana, 
brought copies of Medhatithi's commentary from another country 
and effected a restoration (jiryoddhdra ). This does not refer to the 
restoration of the text of Medhatithi, but to the completion of the 
library of the king, who was Madanapala, son of Sadharapa and 
flourished, as we shall see later on, in the latter half of the 14th 
century. 

Dr. Jolly ( Tagore Law Lectures p. 6 ) holds Medhatithi to be a 
southerner on account of the fact that his father's name was Vira- 
svaminandon account of the atteniion paid to his bh&sya by southern 
writers. It cannot be said that names ending in • svamin * were a 
monopoly of the south. The RajataraAgini gives several literary 
celebrities whose names ended in c svamin ' ( e. g. V. 34 mentions 
a &vasvami ). Ksirasvamin was a Kashmirian. The south has 
always been famed for preserving Mss. of valuable works from the 
north. Mss. of the Kavyalarhkara of Bhamaha, a Kashmirian, are 
very rare and have been found only in the south. Btihler 
( p. cxxin ) seems to be right in holding that Medhatithi was a 
Kashmirian ( or at least an inhabitant of Northern India ). In 
explaining such words as ' svarastre ' and < janapadah ' ( Manu VII. 
32 and VIII. 42 ) Medhatithi introduces Kashmir. He gives ( on 
Manu VIII. 400 ) the monopoly of the sale of elephants as a pri- 
vilege of the kings of Kashmir where saffron abounds. * 68 He says

that the rainbow is called ' vijiiana-chaya ' in Kashmir ( on Manu 
IV. 59 ). He very frequently refers to northerners e. g. on 
Manu III. 234 he says ' kutapa ' is the word for what is well-known 
as 'kambala' among northern people and on III. 238 he says 
c northern people wrap their heads with iatakas ' ( garments ) v 
He says on Manu II. 24 that in the Himalayas in Kashmir it is not 
possible to perform the daily sarhdhya in the open nor is it possible 
to bathe every day in a river in ' Hemanta ' and *&sira\ On 
Manu II. 18 he says f in other countries, some say, people marry 
one's maternal uncle's daughter ; but that is opposed to the words 
of Gautama ' ( 4. 3 ) and proceeds ' even in that country taking 
food in the same plate with ( or in the company of ) one whose 
thread ceremony is not performed is not at all regarded as dharma 
( but as improper conduct )\ This is clearly a reference 10 Baudha- 
yana Dh. S. ( I. 1. 19 ) according to which ' matulasuta-paririayana ' 
and taking food in the same plate with one whose upanayana is not 
performed are two of the five usages peculiar to the south. It is 
fair to add that later writers like Kamalakarabhatta (Nirnayasindhu, 
3rd pariccheda on sapindya ) regard Medhatithi as a southerner. 

Medhatithi quotes from or names numerous smjti writers, such 
as Gautama, Baudhayana, Apastamba, Vasisfha, Visnu, Safikha, 
Manu, Yaj., Narada, Parasara, Brhaspati, Katyayana and others. He 
refers to Brhaspati as a writer on i varta ' ( Manu VII. 43 and IX. 
326 ) and to Brhaspati and Usanas as writers on politics and govern- 
ment ( Manu VIII 285, VII. 2 and 155 ). On Manu VII. 43 he 
refers to Catiakya as a writer on € dandaniti \ In numerous places 
he seems to have drawn upon Kautilya's work. For example, on 
Manu VII. 155 in interpreting ' pancavarga ' as ' kapatika, udasthita, 
gjrhapatika, vaidehika and rtpasavyanjana ' he explains them almost 
in the words of Kautilya ( I. 2 ). On VII. 148 he quotes the five 
arigas of mantra in the very words of Kautilya. 5 ** Vide also his 
remarks on Manu VII. 54 ( testing of ministers by upadhas ). He 
names Asahaya (on 8. 156 )and certain writers as Smrtivivarana- 
karah (on II. 25 ). Biihler is not quite accurate ( p. cxx, n. 1 ) 
when he states that c Medhatithi gives only once the name of an

early commentator \ On VIIL 3 he refers to the interpretations 
of Bhartjyajna. He refers to the interpretations of Yajvan ( on VIIL 
1 5 1 and 156). Yajvan is only the last part of a name ( as in Deva- 
rajayajvan ). He quotes the interpretation of Manu by Upadhyaya 
( on II. 109, IV. 162, V. 43, IX. 141 and 147). Bflhler holds 
that Medhatithi refers to his own teacher. It is more likely that 
Upadhyaya , like Yajvan, is the name or part of the name of a 
previous commentator of Manu. On VIIL 152 the explanations 
of Rju are twice cited. On IX. 253 Medhatithi cites the view of one 
Visnusvamin.570 From the tenor of the quotation it appears that 
Visiiusvamin was a writer on Mtmaiiisa and not a commentator of 
Manu as Btiher thought ( p. cxx, n. 1 ). Some Mss. read the 
word preceding Visnusvami as ' kovara ', others as ' kavara\ It is 
probably ' kavera ' ( residing on the Kaveri river ). 

He quotes ( on Manu I. 19 ) a verse from the Saflkhyakarika 
( 'prakrter mahan &c ). He speaks of Vindhyavasa" 1 as a Sankhya 
and says that he dpes notldmit a subtle interim body (antarabhava- 
deha ). This is probably taken from Rumania's words."* He 
repeatedly refers to the purayas, tells us ( on III. 232 ) that they 
were composed by Vyasa and contained accounts of creation. He 
quotes (on XII. 118 ) a verse from the Vakyapradipa.* 73 

He tells us( on II. 6 ) that the Paiicaratras, Nirgranthas (Jains) 
and Pasupatas were outside the pale of Vedic orthodoxy."* 

Medhatithi had drunk deep at the fountain of the Purva- 
mimamsa. His bhasya is full of the terms vidhi and artluwdda. 
He quotes Jaimini's sutras frequently and applies them to the inter- 
pretation of smrti texts at every step. Vide J B B R A S for 192$ 
p. 219 for examples. He cites passages from Sahara's bh&sya ( e. g. 
on III. 1 ). He mentions Kumarila by name ( on I. 3 ) and as 
Bhaffapada ( on Manu IL 18 ).

Biihler at first took the remark (onManu XII. 19) about 
'Sariraka'as"* referring to Saiikara's bhasya on the VedantasQtra, 
but later on changed his opinion ( S B E vol. 25, p. cxxn ) and 
held that it probably implies a reference to the Sariraka sutras, 
Bahler's considered opinion does not seem to be right. The words 
€ yatheha raja . . . apaiti ' are a summary of SaAkara's bha§ya on 
Vedantasutra II. 1. 34 and II. 3. 42. and I. 2. n-12. On Manu 
II. 83 he refers to the Upanisad-bhasya*? 6 on Chandogya II. 23. 4 
and says that that passage has been differently explained in the 
bhasya. Sankara does explain that passage of the Chandogya differ- 
ently. But this is not all. In various other places Medhatithi 
seems to have in view the Sarirakbhasya of Sankara. For example, 
on I. 80 he has m before him Sankara's bhasya on the sutra Mokavat 
tu lilakaivalyam ' ( Vedantasutra II. 1.33). He, however, seems 
to have favoured the position that the attainment of mokfa is due 5 " 8 
not to mere correct knowledge but to the combination (sawuccaya) 
of knowledge and karma ( vide remarks on Manu VI. 32, 74-7 5 ,

( on I. 3 ), to his being a profound student of Mimamsa. 

From MedhatithPs bhSsya it is perfectly clear that the text of 
Manu on which he commented was practically the same that we 
have now. He refers to ancient ( ciramtana ) expositors of Manu 
( on V. 127 ) and to former (parva ) expositors ( IV. 176, II. 134, 
X. 21 ). He discusses various readings in several places ( vide III. 
119, IV. 99, 185, 229, VIII. 53 ). On VIII. 182-183 he notes* 80 
that the order of the verses was traditionally different. Kulltika 
also notices that those two verses and the next two were read in 
one order by Medhatithi and Bhojadeva and in another by Govinda- 
raja. On 9. 93 he notes that according to some that verse is not 
Manu's.* 81 

Medhatithi's bhasya is full of very interesting information. But 
for want of space it cannot be analysed in detail. The Mit. (on Yaj. 
II. 124) refers to the view of Asaluiya and Medhatithi (on Manu 9. 
118 ) about the fourth share to be given to an unmarried sister at a 
partition between brothers and follows it in preference to Bharuci's. 
On Yaj. III. 24 the Mit. tells us that certain texts of Rsyasjrriga 
about varying periods of impurity for Brahmanas and others were 
not accepted as authoritative by Dharesvara, Visvarupa and Medhatithi. 
According to him> 82 sauuiyasa does not mean the giving up of all the

taking the word c pati* in its etymological sense and says* 8 * that the 
verse suggests that in order to maintain herself in such calamities 
the woman may take service with another person as her protector. 

Medhatithi quotes several verses from his own work called 

Smrtiviveka on Manu II. 6 ( in all 24 verses ) and on X. 5. he says 

that he has dealt with the topic of mixed castes in Smrtiviveka. 

That work therefore was either entirely in verse or contained 

numerous verses. The Parasara-Madhaviya (vol. I, part 2, pp. 183- 

186 ) has a long quotation in verse on the duties of yatis from a 

work called Smrtiviveka and the same work several times quotes 

verses attributed to Medhatithi (vol. I. part I p. 276 and part 2 

p. 172 ). Hence the Smrtiviveka cited by the Para&ra-Madhaviya 

most probably is Medhatithi's work. Lollata* 8 * an early writer 

quotes several verses of Medhatithi in his work on sraddha. In the 

Tithinirriaya-sarvasamuccaya ( Bhadkamkar collection ) several 

verses of Medhatithi on obstacles to marriage such as death are 

quoted. 586 In the Yatidharmasamgraha of Visvesvara-sarasvati 

( AnandaSrama ed. p. 27 ) two well-known verses about c aftdflga- 

tnaitktna ' ( viz. snmranarh kirtanath kelib &c. ) are ascribed to 

Medhatithi and another verse' 8 ? is cited ( on the same page ) about 

the six duties of yatis. These quotations show that Medhatithi

wrote an extensive work in verse on several topics of dharma. It is 
to be fervently hoped that this work of Medhatithi would be 
brought to light some day or other. Coming as it does from such 
an erudite and ancient writer, it would throw a flood of light on 
the development of dharma&stra. 

As Medhatithi names Asahaya and Kumarila and most probably 
quotes the views of Saftkaracarya, he is later than 820 A. D. As 
the Mit. looked upon him as an authoritative writer, he must be 
earlier than 1050 A. D. Most probably he flourished between 825 
and 900 A. D. Kulluka* 88 on Manu HI. 127 says that Medhatithi 
is much earlier than Govindaraja ( 1050-1100 A. D. ). Ldllata 
is mentioned as a predecessor in the Smrtyartha-sara of Sridhara, 
which was composed between 11 50-1200 A. D. So Lollata is 
much earlier than 11 50 A. D. He looked upon Medhatithi as a 
writer whose work was as authoritative as a smrti. A work called 
PrakaSa* 8 * which is quoted in the Kalpataru appears to have 
mentioned Medhatjthi. Hemadri quotes at great length Medhatithi's 
comments in several places.*** Hence the above date is amply 
corroborated. This conclusion is further strengthened by the fact 
that, though he names Asahaya, he does not mention Visvarupa, 
Bharuci or Ankara. If by Mifra 5 * 1 in his comment on Manu XII. 
118 he refers to Vacaspati-misra, the author of the Bhamatiand 
other works, then he will have to be placed after 850 A. D. 

64. Dharesvara Bhojadeva. 

The Mit. ( on Yaj. II. 135 ) says that Dharesvara tries to recon- 
cile the conflicting texts about the right of the widow to succeed to 
her husband's estate by saying that she succeeded if her husband 
was separate and if she was willing to submit to niyoga. On the 
same verse the Mit. says that following Manu 9. 217 Dharesvara 
placed the paternal grand-mother immediately after the mother as 
an heir and even before the father. On Yaj. III. 24 the Mit. says 
that certain texts of R§ya£rAga about impurity on death were not

accepted as authoritative by DhareSvara, Visvarupa and Medhatithi. 
Vide (sec. 60 on ViSvarupa) about the remarks of the Smrticandrika on 
Dharesvara and Visvarupa. The Haralata^ 2 (p. 117) remarks (as 
does the Mit. on Yaj. III. 24) that Bhojadeva, Visvarupa, Govindaraja, 
and the Kamadhenu did not cite certain texts as Jatiikarna's and that 
therefore they were not authoritative. 

That Dharesvara is to be identified with Bhojadeva of Dhara, 
* perhaps the most famous Indian prince as a patron of learned men, 
follows from several considerations. TheDayabhaga^ cites Bhoja- 
deva and Dharesvara without making any distinction between the 
two. Some views that are ascribed to Dharesvara in one work are 
ascribed to Bhojadeva in another. The Vivadatandava of Kamalakara 
ascribes to Bhojadeva the same views as to the widow's rights as are 
ascribed to Dharesvara by the Mit. Mss. of the Rajamartanda 
(commentary on the Yogasutras) have colophons saying that the 
work was composed by Dharesvara Bhojaraja. Dharesvara is styled 
Ocarya by the Mit. ( on Yaj. III. 24 ) and suri by the Smrticandrika (II 
p. 257). Works on numerous branches of knowledge were 
composed by (or in the name of) Bhoja of Dhara. On poetics we 
have twe extensive works o[ his, viz. the Sarasvatikanthabharana and 
the SrAgaraprakasa. A verse at the^ beginning of the Rajamartanda 
tells us that Bhoja composed a work on grammar, a commentary on 
the Yogasutra and a work on medicine called Rajamrganka just as 
Patanjali wrote on these three subjects ( vide Mitra's Notices of Mss, 
vol. I, p. 115 for the medical work of Bhoja called Rajamartanda 
alias Yogasara). He composed a work on astronomy called 
Rajamrgaiika. A work of his on the Saiva agama called Tattva- 
prakasa has been published in the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series. 
There are several other works ascribed to him, which need not be

set out here. That he composed an extensive work on the principal 
subjects of dharma&stra follows from the numerous references to 
him contained in the Mit., the Dayabhaga, the Haralata and other 
works. The Suddhi-kaumudi*** ( B. I. edition ) of Govindinanda 
frequently speaks of a work called Rljamartanda of Bhoja on sraddha. 
The Jayasirfiha-kalpadruma ( p. 26 ) quotes Rajmartaijda and Bhoja- 
rajiya on the same page. Whether Bhoja composed on Dharma- 
sastra one work or two ( as he composed two on poetics ), and 
whether his work was a commentary or an independent digest it is 
difficult to say. M. M. Haraprasada&stri in one of his reports 
threw out the suggestion that the Kamadhenu' was the work of 
Bhoja, but this is entirely wrong, as the words ofSridatta in his 
Pitrbhakti"* will show. 

Besides the two points noted above (about widow's rights and 
about the grandmother ), there are others on which the Mit. and 
Dharesvara disagreed : viz. Dharesvara held ownership to be known 
only from sastra, while the Mit. held it to be laukika ( vide Viramitro- 
daya pp. 528, 536); Dharesvara held that the word Muhitarak 1 iiv 
in Yaj. stands for ptttrikd in the order of succession ( Smjti-candrika 
II. p. 295-96). On other points the views of Dharesvara coincide 
with those of the Mit., viz. on the usage of giving a special share to 
the eldest son having fallen into desuetude, on the daughter's son's 
right to succession, on the father's inability to give a greater or 
smaller share to his sons in ancestral property on a partition during 
his life-time. Vide my article on Bhojadeva in JBBRAS for 1925 
pp. 223-224 for details of these and other views ascribed to Bhoja- 
deva. A few other references may be noted here. The Niroay*- 
mrtaw ( p. 68 ) quotes a Bhojarajiya text. In the Kalaviveka of

878 Btotom <f Dkormattdra 

Jlmtttavahana two verses about taking food at the time of eclipses 
are cited from Bhojadeva ( p. 539). In several works certain views 
are stated 10 be those of a Bhflpalapaddhati or of Bhflpala or of Raja. 
The reference seems to be to a work of king Bhoja. For example, 
in the Danaratnakara a Bhupala-paddhati and Bhflpala are frequently 
quoted. " 8 The Samayapradlpa"* and Acaradar&t of Sridatta speak 
of both Bhflpala and Raja. In other works also the views of Bhoja 
are often referred to as those of Raja ( the king par excellence ). For 
example, the Ekavali 600 ( a work on Poetics) says that in the 
SrAgara-prakaSa the king accepted only one rasa. The Varsakau- 
mudi ( p. 107 ) says that a certain verse is cited by the Gaftgavakya- 
vali without naming the author, but as it is not cited by the Raja and 
the rest, it is unauthoritative. 

< The several tattvas of Raghunandana mention two works of 
Bhojadeva or Bhojaraja. For example, the Tithitattva ( Jivananda 
vol. I, p. 17 ) cites a text as quoted in the Bhujabalabhima by 
Bhojaraja; similarly in the Sraddhatattva, (Jivananda vol. I, p. 266) 
j^two texts are cited as quoted qy Bhojadeva in Bhujabalabhima. 
Raghunandana also mentions Rajamartarida of Bhojaraja ( vide 
Ahnikatattva, vol. I, p. 451 )• He often cites the Rajamartanda and 
the Bhujabalabhima on the same page without the author's name 
( e. g. vide Udvahatattva, vol. II, p. 124 ). Raghunandana often 
speaks of a Brhad-Rajamartarida along with the Rajamartap^a on 
the same or the next page (vide Tithitattva, vol. I, pp. 25-26 and 
Jyotistattva pp. 605 and p. 655 ). That the Bhujabalabhima and 
the Rajamartanda are two different works appears to be clear. 
Whether the Bfhad-Rajamartanda and the Rajamartaijda are distinct 
works is not quite clear. ( Vide Tri. Cat. of Madras Govt. mss. for

1919-22, p. 4562, No. 3079 for Bhujabalanibandha of Bhojaraja in 
18 adhyayas on astrological matters in relation to dharmasastra 
such.as strijataka, karoadivedha, vrata, vivahamelaka-dakka, grha- 
karmapraveSa, saihkrantisnana, dvada&masakrtya ). The Bhuja- 
balabhima is also mentioned by Sfllapa^i and by Rudradhara in his 
Sraddhaviveka. 

Bhoja of Dhara, according to the Bhojaprabandha, had a long 
reign of 55 years. There are three certain dates of his. A grant 
of Bhoja is dated sathvat 1078 (i. e. 1021-22 A. D.). Vide I. A. 
vol. VI, p. 53 ; vide also I. A. vol. 41, p. 201 for Bhoja's grant dated 
sathvat 1076 Magha (Jan. 1020 ) and E. I. vol. XVIII, p. 320 for 
Betma plate of Bhoja dated 1076 Bhadrapada (September 1020A.D.). 
His astronomical work, the RajamrgaAka, takes iake 964 ( 1042-43 
A. D. ) as its initial date. 601 Bhoja's uncle Munja was slain by 
Tailapa between 994-997 A. D. and Munja was succeeded by Sindhu- 
raja or Sindhula also styled Navasahasaftka. An inscription of 
Jayasimha, the successor of Bhoja, is dated sathvat 11 12, i. e. 1055- 
56 A. D. (vide E. I. vol. Ill, pp. 46-50). Therefore Bhoja must 
have reigned between 1000 and 1055 A. D. 

There is a work named Dharma-pradipa by Bhoja ( Deccan 
College No. 26 of 1874-75). It is a work by another Bhoja later 
than 1400 A. D., as it quotes Vijfianesvara and the Madanaparijata. 
It was composed by an assembly of pandits at the bidding of king 
Bhoja of Asapura, son of Bharamalla. The ms. was copied in 
sathvat 1695 (i. e. 1638-39 A. D. ). 

65. Devasvamin 

The Smrticandrika tells us that Devasvamin composed like An- 
kara and £ambhu a work in the nature of a digest of smftis (sntfti- 
samuccaya). Vide note 563 above. The commentary of Narayana 
of the Naidhruva gotra, son of Divakara, on the A£valayana- 
grhyasatra 60 * says that it relies upon the bhasya of Devasvamin 
on the same work. Gargya Narayana, son of Narasimha, 
in his commentary on the Asvalayana-srautasfitra, tells us that 
he follows the bha$ya of Devasvamin thereon. It is hardly 

{WJiTlf ( D - 0. ms. No. 105 of 1873-74 ). 



*60 MbtavtfJHkmmtoim 

likely that two writers of the same name flourished about the same 
time. Hence it may be assumed that Devasvamin wrote bha§yas on 
the ASvaUyana &rauta and Grhya sutras and a digest of smrtis, where 
he discussed all topics of dharma, such as acara, vyavahara, a£auca&c. 
The commentrry of Bhattoji 60 * on the Caturviriisatimata refers to the 
view of Devasvamin on sraddha and aiauca. Hemadri 60 * (vol. Ill, 
part 2, p. 324 ) and Madhava (on ParaSara, vol. I, part 2, p. 328 ) 
also quote Devasvamin. The Smrticandrika quotes the views of 
Devasvamin on vyavahara and a£auca several times. For example, 
Devasvamin 60 * explained the word Yautaka differently from the 
Nighantu ( which explained it as the wealth that was given to a 
woman when she was seated on the same seat with her husband at 
the time of marriage ). Devasvamin explained that the words of 
the Samgraha 606 that, when a son was born to one of several full 
brothers, he stood as a son to all and that the same rule applied to 
several co-wives when one of them had a son, meant that in both 
cases another son should not be adopted. Devasvamin held the 
view (like Bhojadeva) that the word 'duhitr' in Yajiiavalkya's 
verses on succession meant putrtka. 60 ^ Devasvamin explained

Manu 608 9. 141 as saying that the adopted son ( in the particular case 
mentioned by Manu) took all the wealth and the gotra of his adoptive 
father. Vide Smrticandrika (Mysore ed.) on a&uca p. 22. The 
Vaijayanti ot Nandapagdita(on Visnu 22. 32) quotes the view of 
Devasvamin that on the death of unmarried daughters mourning was 
to be observed for ten days. 60 * The Smrticandrika quotes a verse 
from Devasvamin 610 on sraddha also. 

In the Prapancahrdaya ( Tri. S. series, p. 39) we are told that 
Devasvamin composed a brief gloss on the 12 adhyayas of the 
Pflrvamimamsasutra and the four adhyayas of the Samkarsakaijda, 
seeing that the bhasyas of Bodhayana and Upavarsa were vast. The 
Govt, collection of Mss. at Madras has Devasvamin's bhasya on the 
Sarhkarsakanda (vide Tri. Cat. vol. Ill, part I, Sanskrit C, p. 3841). 
There are not sufficient data available to establish the identity of this 
writer with Devasvamin, the writer on dharmasastra. 

As the Smrticandrika quotes Devasvamin so profusely, he cannot 
be later than 11 50 A. D. His earlier limit can be determined in 
several ways. Gargya Narayana's comment on Asvalayanasrauta ( II. 
1. 14) is quoted by Trikandamandana, who is himself quoted by 
Hemadri. Therefore Gargya Narayana could not have flourished 
later than 1 100 A. D. ( vide Bhandarkar's Report on search for mss., 
1883-84, pp. 30-31). Therefore Devasvamin probably flourished 
about 1000-1050 A. D., if not earlier. The fact that Devasvamin 
held certain views similar to Bhojadeva's also corroborates the 
chronological position thus assigned to him. 

66. Jitendriya 

Jitendriya is one of those writers who at one time held an 
eminent position but in course of time sank into unmerited oblivion. 
The works of Jimfltavahana bear abundant testimony to the fact that 
Jitendriya wrote an extensive work on dharmasastra. In his Kala- 
viveka ( p . 380) Jimfctavahana says that Jit endriya 6 " wrote on the

topic of kala (i. e. on determining doubtful points about the 
months, the tithis, samkrtntis, &c. and the religious rites to be 
performed on them ). In several passages of the Kalaviveka the very 
words of Jitendriya are quoted. Jitendriya said that a rite that 
occupies in performance only a short time musj be performed at the 
principal time indicated for it 6 '* ( and not at a gaupa time ). From 
another quotation it appears that Jitendriya controverted the views 
of a predecessor Sambhramabhafta. 61 ' Jitendriya is said to have 
enumerated the names of the fifteen tnuhartas of the day from the 
Matsyapurina 61 * ; vide pp. 257, 367 of the Kalaviveka for other 
places where the views of Jitendriya on kala occur. In the 
Diyabhaga of Jimutavihana also Jitendriya is frequently mentioned. 
The Dayabhaga says that, if a man takes another's gold believing 
it to be iron or takes what is another's believing ( in good faith ) that 
it is his own, Jitendriya held in his remarks on the section of 
prayaicitta that he is not guilty of theft. 6 ' 5 The peculiar doctrine of 
the Dayabhaga that the widow of a person, whether he was separate 
or a member of a joint family, succeeded to her deceased husband's 
estate had been already expounded by Jitendriya. 6 ' 6 The view of 
Jitendriya was that whatever is acquired by a person without using 
means or materials jointly owned by all members of a family is his 
exclusive property and that maitra (gifts of a friend) and audvahikaire

only cited ( by Yaj. ) as examples of this proposition/ 1 ? Jitendriya 
held the daughter's son entitled to succeed after the daughter, just as 
Vi£varfipa, Bhoja and Govindaraja did. In the Vyavaharamatrka 
of JimQtavahana also Jitendriya's views are cited ( on pp. 302, 334 ). 
This shows that he wrote also on procedure in law courts, 
jitendriya is also referred to in the Dayatattva of Raghnnandana. 61 * 
But no other early writer quotes Jitendriya. Therefore it appears 
that Jitendriya was probably a Bengal writer and flourished about 
1 000-1050 A. D. and that he was completely eclipsed by the brilliant 
JimQtavahana. 

67. Balaka. 

Balaka like Jitendriya is no more than a name to us. JimQtavahana's 
works make frequent reference to him. He held the view that the 
daughter's son, not being expressly mentioned as an heir by Yaj., 
came in after those expressly mentioned from the widow to the 
brother. 6 '* The Dayabhaga notices that Balaka read a text of 
Apastamba in a wrong way. 630 Balaka said that the words of Sartkha 
' svaryatasya-aputrasya bhratrgami dravyam. • . jyestha va patni' 
apply either to a widow belonging to a caste other than her husband's 
or to a very young widow or in case her husband was undivided or 
re-united. 621 Balaka says that when some property is acquired by 
one brother by means of learning, other brothers are not entitled

to that wealth. 6 " The Dayabhaga refers to a passage from Balaka 
in which the latter relies on the Purvamlmariisa example of mudgt 
and tnOfa. 6 ** In the Vyavaharamatrka of Jimfltavahana ( p. 346 ) 
it is stated that Bala held the same views as those of &rikara-mi£ra 
on a certain point. In the Praya&itta-nirfipafla of Bhavadeva a 
writer named Valoka is mentioned ( vide JASB 1912 at p. 336 ). 
This seems to be a Bengali scribe's way of pronouncing the name 
Balaka. Balaka is mentioned in Raghunandana's Vyavaharatattva 
(p. 47) also as holding the view with Srikara and others that 
adverse possession for twenty years conferred ownership in the case 
of immovable property. 6 '* Sulapani in his Durgotsaviveka twice 
quotes the views of Balaka and once refutes the latter. 6a * Hence it 
appears that Balaka was an eastern or Bengal writer, composed a 
work on several branches of dharmasastra ( such as vyavahara and 
prayascitta ) and flourished before 1 100 A. D. 

68. Balarupa. 

In the Smrtisara of Harinatha( I. O. cat. No. 301, folio 128a ff ) 
there is a long passage setting out the views of Balarupa on the 
question of the succession to a childless man. In the Vivada-

that the words of Yaj. (II. 117 tabhyajte'nvayah) mean the off- 
spring of the mother and on the succession to reunited coparceners 
are cited. In the Vivadacintamapi of Vacaspati*'? the views of Bala- 
rupa are frequently cited* Relying on the words of Para&ra, 
BalarQpa held that an unmarried daughter was entitled to preference 
over a married one as an heir to a sonless man. As regards the 
verse of Harita that if a young widow was karkaid ( quarrelsome, 
( suspected of unchastity ' according to others ), then she was to be 
given maintenance alone ( out of her husband's estate ), Balarupa's 
view was that it refers to the widow of a re-united coparcener.* 28 
BalarQpa was of opinion that dtmabandhus, pitrbandhus and mMf- 
bandhus succeeded in the order stated. 62 ' The Kaladarfa of Aditya- 
bhafta names Balarupa among the authorities on which it relies. 
This shows that BalarQpa wrote not only on vyavahara but also on 
kiln. 

As Harinatha and the Vivadacandra mention BalarQpa he is 
certainly earlier than about 1250 A. D. The important question 
is whether Balaka and Balarupa are identical. I think, though with 
some hesitation, that they are identical. The difficulty is caused 
by the fact that Harinatha speaks of 'the author of BalarQpa/ which 
implies that Balarupa is a work and not an author, while the 
others speak of Balarupa as an autfor. The Dayabhaga always 
speaks of Balaka and never of BalarQpa, while the Mithila writers, 
Misaru-miSra, Vacaspati and Harinatha, speak of Balarupa and not 
of Balaka. Balaka is not mentioned by any writer belonging to a 
province other than Bengal. It is not likely that there were two 
early authors belonging to the same locality on vyavahara bearing 
two names so nearly the same as Balaka ( or Bala ) and Balarupa. 
Moreover if we read one quotation from the Dayabhaga between 
the lines ( vide note 621 ) where Jimutavahana makes fun of Balaka 
by charging him with having exposed his Bdlarupatva ( being Bala- 
rupa, being childish ) it appears that the Dayabhaga looked upon 
Balaka and BalarQpa as identical. If so Balaka or BalarQpa 



IN IKitoy if BkurmatiUtrQ 

becomes an ancient writer, who flourished certainly before nop 
A. D. As he held the same views as Srtkara and an antiquated 
view about the rights of the daughter's son he must not be later than 
1050 A. D. 

60. Yogloka 

Yogloka like Jitendriya and Balaka is a writer about whom we 
know only from the works of Jimtttavahana and Raghunandana. 
He is the last of the series of writers enumerated in one place by the 
Kalaviveka as having dealt with the subject f of tola (vide note 611 
above ). The Vyavahara-matrka of JimQtavahana very frequently 6 * 
cites the views of Yogloka and generally twits him with thinking 
himself as being a logician or a new-fangled ( nava-tarkikath-manya) 
logician. Both in the Kalaviveka and the VyavaharamStrka Yogloka 
is generally cited for being refuted ( e. g. pp. 457-58, 465, 483 of the 
Kalaviveka ). It is only very rarefy that Jimutavahana agrees with 
Yogloka ( as on p. 369 of the Kalaviveka ). From certain passages 
of the Kalaviveka it follows that Yogloka composed two works, one 
called Brhad- Yogloka ( larger work ) and the other styled Svalpa- 
Yogloka(a smaller-work ).**' It appears that Yogloka was later 
than Srikara and accepted certain illustrations given by the latter. 6 ' 3 
The Vyavahatatattva of Raghunandana informs us that like Ankara 
and Balaka, Yogloka held the view that twenty years' adverse 
possession of immoveables conferred ownership ( vide note 624 
above). The same work tells us that the Maithilas followed 
the view of Ypgloka that the verse of Katyayana (yadyekade£a- 
vyaptapi... nrpam) was intended to apply to a case where a 
litigant threw down the challenge that if even one out of several

items of property charged were brought home to him as having 
been stolen by him, he would restore all the items claimed. 6 " 

The foregoing establishes that Yogloka wrote at least on k&la 
and vyavahdra and composed two treatises on k&la. 

jimfitavahana 6 " says that a predecessor of his styled Dik§ita 
criticized a certain reading of Yogloka's, i. e. Yogloka preceded 
Dik§ita, who was a predecessor of Jimutavahana. Jimutavahana 
further refers to ancient ( pur&tana ) mss. of Yogloka's work. Hence 
Yogloka must have preceded Jimtttavahana by at least a hundred 
years. He is later than Srikara ( note 632 above). Therefore he 
must have flourished between 950-1050 A. D. 

70. Vijnanesvara 

The Mitaksara of Vijnanesvara occupies a unique place in the 
Dharma&stra literature. Its position is analogous to that of the 
Mahabhasya of Patanjali in grammar or to that of the Kavyapraka£a 
of Mammata in Poetics. It represents the essence of dharma&stra 
speculation that preceded it for about two thousand years and it 
became the fountain head from which flowed fresh streams of 
exegesis and developments. Under the decisions of the Courts in 
British India, the Mitaksara is of paramount authority in several 
matters of Hindu Law (such as adoption, inheritance, partition etc* ) 
throughout India except where, as in Bengal, theDayabhaga prevails. 

The Mit. professes to be a commentary on the Yajnavalkya- 
smjti. In the colophons of several mss. it is described as Rju- 
mitak§ara, Pramitak§ara or simply Mitak§art. These names are 
probably due to some of the verses appended at the end of the 
commentary. 6 ** The Mit. is not only a commentary explanatory

of the verses of Yajnavalkya, but it is in the nature of a digest ot 
smrti material. It brings together numerous smrti passages, explains 
away contradictions among them by following the rules of inter- 
pretation laid down in the Pfirvamlmariisa system, brings about 
order by assigning to various dicta their proper scope and province 
( vifayavyavastba ) and effects a synthesis of apparently disconnected 
smrti injunctions. 

The Mit. quotes a host of smrti writers 6 * 6 and six predecessors, 
who were commentators and authors of digests on dharmasastra, viz. 
Asahaya, Vi£varfipa, Medhatithi, &rikara, Bharuci and Bhojadeva. 
Besides it quotes Vedic works ( like the Kathaka ), the Brhadaranya- 
kopani§ad, the Garbhopanisad, the Jabalopanisad, the Nirukta, 
Bharata ( author of Natya&stra ), Yogasutra, Pacini, Susruta, the 
SkandapQrana, the Vi§iiupurana, Amara, Guru ( i.e. Prabhakara ). 

The author styles himself Vijnanayogin in the concluding verses 
of his commentary and later writers frequently refer to him in that 
way. He belonged to the Bharadvaja go Ira and was son of Padma- 
nabhabhafta. He was a parantahathsa ( i. e. an ascetic ) and was the 
pupil of Uttama. He tells us that when he wrote the Mitak§ara, 
king Vikramarka or Vikramadityadeva was ruling in the city called 
Kalyapa 6 " ( now in the Nizam's dominion ). The verses at the

end containing the personal history appear to be genuine. They 
occur in the oldest Mss. of the Mit. such as the Government of 
Bombay Ms. dated iakasathvat 1389. 

The author of the Mit. was a profound student of the Purva- 
mimamsa system. Throughout the Mit. discussion of Purva- 
nnmariisa nydyas and their application to dharma&stra are sown 
broadcast. For example, the Mit. on Yaj. I. 81 (whether it is a 
niyama or parisattikhya\ I. 86, II. 114, II. 126, II. 265 &c, may 
be consulted. The Mit., as the very name implies, is generally 
concise and to the point. But in his desire to make his work a 
repository and synthesis of varied smrti dicta the author does not 
mind if he has occasionally to expand his commentary to enormous 
lengths. For example, the Mit. on Yaj. III. 265 and 290 occupies 
several pages of closely printed text. 

As the Mitaksara names Visvarupa, Medhatithi and Dharesvara, 
it must have been composed after 1050 A. D. The Smrticandrika 6 * 8 
of Devaijnabhatta ( which as will be seen later on was composed 
about 1200 A. D. ) several times criticizes the views of the Mit., 
viz. the latter's remarks that the giving of an additional share to the 
eldest son is disapproved of by the people, the reasons given for 
preferring the mother to the father and the definition of d&ya. 
Vijiianesvara is named in the Kalpataru of Laksmidhara 6 " ( compos- 
ed in the 2nd quarter of the 12th century ). This shows that the 
Mit. was composed before 1120 A. D. A greater approximation 
can be arrived at in several ways. The Kalpataru mentions

190 history cffiharmafatrtt 

Vadibhayamkara* 40 who, the Viramitrodaya 6 * 1 tells us, was an 
admirer and follower of Vijiiane£vara and yet found fault with his 
explanation of Yaj. II. 51 ( rikthagraha rpam &c. ). Therefore the 
Mit. must have been composed at the latest before 1100 A. D. 
Among the Calukyas of Kalyana, the only king named Vikramirka 
or Vikramaditya during whose reign VijiianeSvara could have 
flourished is Vikramaditya VI who reigned for over fifty years from 
about 1076 to 1 1 27 A. D. Vide Bombay Gazetteer vol. I, part 2, 
pp. 446-453, 1. A. vol. 48 p. 6 ( for pedigree of the Calukyas of 
Kalyaga with dates ), I. A. vol. 12 p. 212 (for an inscription of 
Vikramaditya Tribhuvanamalla dated lake 1047 ) and I. A. vol. 22, 
pp. 296-298. From all these considerations it follows that the Mit. 
was composed between 1070-1100 A. D. 

Out of the numerous commentaries on the Mit. those of Visve- 
£vara, Nandapandita and Balambhafta are the most famous. Vide sec- 
tions 93, 105, 1 1 1 . Considerations of space preclude any detailed state- 
ment of the doctrines peculiarly associated with the name of Vijiia- 
neSvara. There are however some which must be mentioned. He 
laid down ( on Yaj. I. 52 ) that wherever the word sapiyda occur- 
red, it denoted either directly or mediately connection with particles 
of one body (i. e. blood-relationship with an ancestor ). He also 
strictly adheres to the principle that propinquity is the guiding 
principle in matters of inheritance and succession. He divides d&ya 
into apratibandha&ni sapratibandha and affirmed that sons, grandsons 
and great-grandsons acquired by birth ownership in ancestral 
property. On all these matters he is diametrically opposed to 
JimQtavahana. 

Aufrechtin his great catalogue makes conflicting statements 
about a work called Asaucadasaka. On I. p. 55 he notes that A&u- 
cadasaka is a work of Harihara with a commentary by Vijiianesvara 
and again on I. p. 571 he ascribes Asaucadasaka-tfka to Vijfianeivara. 
On I. p. 762 he ascribes the A&ucada&ka and Da&£lokivivaraga to 
Harihara and appears to distinguish him from that Harihara who 



70. VijiaiMham Hi 

composed a bha§ya on Paraskaragrhyasfltra. On I. p. 795 he corrects 
himself by saying that Harihara wrote only the commentary on the 
A&ucada£aka and that the latter is identical with the Daiaslokl- 
vivarana. On III. p. 121 he is doubtful whether the A£aucada$aka 
is a work of Vijnanesvara. In the Deccan College collection there 
is an ancient Ms. ( No. 196 of 1884-1887 ) of the A&mcada&ka. 6 " 
It was copied in sathvat 1 578 Margasirsa ( i. e. December 1 522 A. D. ). 
It distinctly says that Vijiiane£varayogin composed in ten &ardftla- 
vikridita stanzas a work on aiauca and that Harihara composed a 
commentary on it. In the Bhadkamkar collection there is an old 
Ms. of the ASaucadasaka, the colophon of which ascribes the work 
to VijnaneSvara. Vide I. O. cat. p. 565, No. 1749 for a ms. of 
A£aucada£aka with Harihara's commentary dated sathvat 1589 
( I S3 2 "33 A- D. ) That the Asaucadasaka was a very popular work 
follows from the several commentaries thereon that are available 
even now. Raglmn&tha'", son of Madhava and nephew of the 
famous Narayanabhafta, composed a commentary on the Da£a£loki in 
Sake 1500 (D.CNo. 82 of A. 1882-83). There is another 
commentary on the same work by Bhaftoji ( D. C. No. 99 of 
1582-83 ). Harihara quotes in his bha§ya, besides several well- 
known smrtikaras, a work called Visvadarsa ( folio 4b )/«♦ Harihara, 
the commentator of the Paraskaragrhyasutra, is described as the 
pupil of Vijnanesvara in several mss. Harihara in his bhasya 
on Paraskaragrhya quotes Vijnanesvara and Kalpataru. The ViSva- 
darsa praises Vijnanesvara very highly.* 4 * Therefore it appears that

Vijnine^vara composed the A$aucada£aka alias Da£asloki and that 
Harihara, who was either VijnaneSvara's pupil or not very far 
removed from him ( as he is quoted by Hemadri ) composed a com- 
mentary thereon. The first verse of the Da£a£loki is cited below as 
a specimen of the concise style attempted by the author. 6 * 6 

Aufrecht(II. p, 50 and I, p. 236 ) credits Vijfianeivara with a 
bha?ya on Triihsat-Sloki, a work in thirty Sragdhara stanzas on 
aiauca. This work together with the commentary was printed in 
pothi size at Benares in sathvat 19 18 (1861-62 A. D.). The 
printed text contains 64 ? the same colophon at the end and date as 
-the D. C. ms. No. 217 of 1879-80, which was copied in sathvat 
171 1 Caitra(i. e. April 1655 A. D. )• It is extremely doubtful, 
however, whether VijiianeSvara wrote a bhasya on the Trim£at-$lokl. 
In the bhasya Vijnane£vara and the Mitaksara are cited by name. 6 * 8 
The manner of referring to them rather suggests that the commentary 
on the Triihsat-iloki was composed by some person other than 
Vijiiane£vara, who, however, drew largely on the Mit. There is a 
ms. of the Trimiat-iloki with a commentary in the Bbau Daji 
collection which is ascribed to Hemadri on the cover ( vide BBRAS. 
cat, vol. II. p. 209, No. 667 ). 

In the Madras Govt. mss. library there is a ms. of the Vyavahara- 
£iromani of Narayana, who says that he learnt dharmasastras under 
Vijfianesvara ( adhitya dharmasastrani Vijnane£vara-sadgurob ). 
The work deals with the vyavahara portion and was composed for 
the benefit of the un-initiated (balabodhartham). The ms. contains 
the portion dealing with the king's duty to look into the disputes of 
people, the time for doing that, sabha, definition of prad-vivaka 
(judge), the plaint and its defects, asedha ( restraint of the

verse ' patni duhitara&aiva \ He closely follows the Mitik§ari in 
all that he says ; but in one place he expressly differs from his 
teacher, viz. whereas the Mitaksara mentions four different times for 
partition, Narayaga says that there are really two times of partition, 
when the father desires partition and when the son or sons desire 
it.Ma On satiibhayasamutthana he quotes a passage from Kautalya 
( the ms. uses this form ), which agrees closely with the printed 
text ( vide Artha&stra III. 14, p. 186, ed. by ShamaSastri ). 6 * 8 b 

71. Kamadhenu 

This was an ancient digest on the various branches of Dharma- 
sastra. Unfortunately no ms. of this work has yet come to light. 
The Kalpataru of Laksmidhara refers to the view of Kamadhenu and 
others that what was bestowed upon a slave ( ddsa ) by his master 
through favour was also under the control of the master. 6 ** The 
Haralata which was composed in the third quarter of the 12th 
century several times mentions the views of Kamadhenu. 650

Srldharacarya, in his Smrtyarthasara/* 1 enumerates the Kamadhenu 
among the works and writers who dwelt upon the teachings of the 
Smrtis. The Vivadratnakara 6 * 2 of CandeSvara speaks of the 
Kamadhenu several times. In the Sraddhakriya-kaumudi certain 
verses from the Kamadhenu are cited in connection with the rites 
on certain titbis of the month of Aivina ( p. 261 )• Sulapani in his 
Sraddhaviveka names as his authorities the Kamadhenu and other 
digests after the smrtis. 6 " The Samayapradipa 6 " of Sridatta notices 
that the Kamadhenu read ' dvitiya caitramasasya, ' while the 
Kalpataru read € trtiya. ' The same reading of the Kamadhenu is 
noticed in the Smrtisaraof Harinatha ( I. O. cat., No. 634, folio 79b )• 
In the Rajanitiratnakara the Kamadhenu is quoted on the definition 
of 'raja* and on the two varieties of rulers ( pp. 2 and 5 ). In 
Hemadri there is a quotation from Smjtikamadhenu ( vol. IV, 
p. 992 ) about the freedom in kali from incurring sin on account 
of contact with great sinners. 

The question arises who is the author of the Kamadhenu. If 
we rely upon a highly paronomastic passage of the Vyavahararatna- 
kara 6 " of.Candelvara, Gopala was the author of the Kamadhenu. 
In the Rajanitiratnakara (p. 81) Gopala is said to have held, with

Lak?midhara and Srikara, 6 * 6 the view that on the state wealth poor 
and helpless people have a claim and that the state perishes if the 
supreme authority is wielded by many (and not by one). The 
same work ( p. 84 ) cites the opinion of Gopala that the coronation 
rites mentioned in works on rd/aniti are merely illustrative and 
that according to the particular usages of countries and families a 
king may be proclaimed without those rites by merely being seated 
on a throne. 6 " The Pitfbhakti of Sridatta expressly mentions that 
it is based on the works of Gopala and others. The Viramitrodaya 
cites the view of Gopala that vyavahara comes under what is called 
jalpa in the technique of the Nyaya system and that the view of 
Misra that Vyavahara is comprised under the term vada of the same 
system is wrong. Whether the Gopala mentioned by Mitramisra is 
the same as the author named by Candesvara it is difficult to say. 
But it seems to me that they are identical. Aufrecht in his great 
catalogue ( I. 93 ) ascribes the authorship of the Kamadhenu to 
Sambhu. Whence he derived this information is not clear. The 
authors and works cited by him do not, so tar as I know, ascribe 
the Kamadhenu to Sambhu. It is true that Sambhu is credited by the 
Smjticandrika with a digest on dbarmaidstra ( vide note 563 above ) 
and the Smrtyarthasara also names him as one of the authorities on 
which it relies. Hemadri 6 ** also tells us that Sambhu was a nibandha- 
kara and refuted the views of Medhatithi on Manu III. 125. The 
Smj-ticandrika frequently cites the views of Sambhu on vyavahara 
and generally refutes them. For example, on the word 'pitarau* 
occurring in Yaj. II. 135 Sambhu remarked that no difference should 
be made between the parents (father and mother) as heirs, since 
whoever out of the two took the wealth of their son it would come

to both.** Vide also Smpicandrika n, pp. 205, 216. Therefore 
Sambhu also, being mentioned by the Smjticandrika and the 
Smjtyarthasara, is certainly earlier than 11 50 A. D. In this state 
of the authorities I am doubtful whether Sambhu was the author of 
the Kamadhenu. I am inclined to hold that he was not the author 
of that work and that Gopala was the author. This conclusion is 
somewhat strengthened by the fact that the Smrtyarthasara mentions 
both Kamadhenu and Sambhu as authorities on which it relies. If 
Sambbu had been, in the opinion of the Smjtyarthsara the author 
of the Kamadhenu, the mention of both would have been super- 
fluous. Mr. Jayasval (in JBORSfor 1927, vol. XIII, parts 3-4, 
p. VII ) ascribes the Kamadhenu to Bhoja, but this is wrong ( vide 
p. 277, note 576). 

As the Kamadhenu is named as an authority by the Kalpataru 
and the Haralata it is certainly not later than 1 100 A. D. It cannot 
be very much earlier since it is not mentioned by Medhatithi and 
the Mitak§ara. It may therefore be assigned to the period between 
1000 and 1 100 A. D. 

72. Halayudha 

The Kalpataru 661 of Lak§midhara in its vyavahara section quotes 
the views of a jurist Halayudha several times. The Vivadaratnakara 
of Candesvara mentions Halayudha dozens of times. In the Smjti- 
sara of Harinatha 662 Halayudha-nibandha on possession is quoted. 
The Smjtisara also says ( folio 140 a ) that Halayudha favoured 
niyoga by the widow of a son-less deceased person and deprived tlic 
widow of succession to her deceased husband if she did not submit: 
to niyoga . This was the view of Dhare£vara also. According to 
Halayudha 66 * parents succeeded before brothers to a deceased person

if the property in the hands of the deceased was ancestral, but that 
if it was acquired without detriment to ancestral property then 
brothers succeeded even before parents. Halayudha is cited in the 
Vivadacintamani also, e. g. Halayudha 66 * held the view that the 
verse of Yaj. (II. 126 ) was intended to convey that where joint 
property was concealed by a member and was discovered after 
partition, he did not incur the guilt of theft. This same view was 
held by Jitendriya and others. Raghunandana quotes Halayudha 
in his Divyatattva, Dayatattva and Vyavaharatattva. The Vira- 
mitrodaya 66 * also quotes Halayudha. 

The foregoing shows that the work of Halayudha, the jurist, was 
a very valuable one. This Halayudha must have flourished before 
1100 A. D., since the Kalpataru ( 1125-1150 A. D.) looked upon 
him as an authority. As Halayudha is not mentioned by any of the 
early commentators like Medhatithi and by the Mit. and as he held 
opinions similar to those of Dharesvara, Jitendriya and others, he 
cannot well be placed earlier than 1000 A. D. Therefore he 
flourished between 1000 and 1100 A. D. He was probably a 
Maithila or Bengali writer, as, among the comparatively early writers 
on dharma, it is the writers of the north, particularly of Mithila and 
Bengal, that rely upon him as a great authority. 

The name Halayudha ( an epithet of Balarama, the brother of 
Krsna ) was a common one in India. It seems to have been borne 
by several eminent writers and this fact has created a great deal of 
contusion. There is one Halayudha who was the author of the 
Abhidhanaratnamala ( edited by Aufrecht ), the Kavirahasya( edited 
by Sourindra Mohan Tagore in 1879 and by Heller in 1900 ) and 
probably the Mrtasanjivani, a commentary on the Chandah-sutra of 
Pingala. In the Kavirahasya he gives the various forms of roots 
in the several conjugations and connects all verses with Krsoa, the

emperor of the Deccan ( Daksigapatha ). 666 This Kjspaiaja was 
most probably the Ra§trak&ta emperor Kr§oa whose dates range from 
940 A. D. to 959 A. D. ( vide JBBRAS, vol. 18, page 239 ; Bom. 
Gazetteer I., part 2, p. 210 ; I. A. vol. n, p. 109 and BhandarkaVs 
Report, 1883-84, pp. 8-9. )• In the colophon to the Mpasanjlvani 
the author is described simply as bhatta-Halayudha. In that com- 
mentary verses are quoted as illustrations wherein Munja alias 
Vakpatiraja is highly extolled. 66 ? Munja was slain by Tailapa 
between 994-997 A. D. Hence Halayudha, the author of the com- 
mentary on Piftgala, must not have flourished much earlier than 
the latter half of the 10 century. It is not unlikely that Halayudha 
after being at the court of the Ra§trakutas migrated to Avanti when 
the star of Munja, who was himself a scholar, rose on the horizon 
of central India and when the fortunes of the Rastrakfttas waned. 
But this Halayudha who hailed from the Deccan cannot be the first 
Halayudha who appears to have flourished in Mithila or Bengal. 

There is another Halayudha, author of a famous work called 
Brahmana-sarvasva printed at Benares in samvat 1935. But this 
was not available to me and hence I used a Ms. of it in the Deccan 
College collection ( No. 9 of A 1883-84 ). He gives some account 
of himself and his family in the introductory verses. He belonged 
to the Vatsya gotra and was a son of Dhananjaya who is described 
as dharmadbyakfa ( judge ). Laksmanasena, the king of Bengal, 
gave him dharmadhikara ( i. e. made him judge ). 668 He had two 
elder brothers 66 * Pasupati and teana of whom the former composed 
Sraddha-krtya-paddhati and Pakayajfia-paddhati and the latter the

composed Mimariisasarvasva, Vai$riavasarvasva, £aivasarvasva, Pao- 
ditasarvasva. 6 ? Unfortunately no Ms. of any of these works has so 
far been discovered. The chief object 6 ? 1 of the Brahmaiiasarvasva 
is to explain the meaning of the mantras used by Brahmanas in 
daily observances from the brushing of the teeth to going to sleep 
and in the sathsk&ras on birth, marriage, death etc. He wrote for 
the Vajasaneya Kanva Sakha and acknowledges 6 ? 2 his debt to Uvafa 
who wrote a bhasya on the Vajasaneya Saihhita in Avanti while 
Bhoja ruled the earth ( mahiih Bhoje pra&asati ). In some intro- 
ductory verses and the several colophons of the sections of the 
Brahmana-sarvasva Halayudha styles himself avasathika, tnabadhar- 
madhyakfa or simply dhartnodhyakfa, dharm&dhikdrin and his brother 
Pasupati also is styled dvasatbika. It is very difficult to say what is 
the exact meaning of this last word. It probably means one who 
regularly performs all the grhya rites. 6 " Vide Tri. cat. of Madras 
Govt. Mss. for 1919-1922, pp. 5165 for a ms. of Pandita-sarvasva 
which deals with the usages of varnas and a&ramas, tithi, &uddhi, the 
time for fraddha, jyotih&stra, marriage, gifts, prayakitta, pratisfha 
&c. But whether it is Halayudha's work it is difficult to say from 
the extracts given. 

The time when Halayudha the author of the Brahmanasarvasva 
flourished can be easily settled as he was the dharmadhyak§aof Lak§- 
mariasena of Bengal. The Adbhutasagara was begun in lake 1090*7*

by his son Laksmaiiasena. That these verses are not spurious 
follows from a reference in the Todarananda-samhita-saukhya about 
the position of the constellation of the Great Bear according to the 
Adbhuta&gara in the iake year 1082 (1 160-61 A. D. ) while 
Ballalasena was ruling. 6 ? s The Saduktikarpamrta of Sridharadasa 6 ? 6 , 
who was a contemporary of Laksamanasena, furnishes us with the 
exact year of the accession of Laksamanasena viz: that safe 1127 
corresponded with the 27th year of Laksama^asena's reign, i. e. he 
began to reign in 1178-79 A. D. Therefore the literary activity 
of Halayudha, the author of the Brahmanasarvasva, lies between 
1 175-1200 A. D. There is, I am aware, a very heated controversy 
about the dates of Ballalasena and his son Laksamanasena, but I am 
inclined to hold, particularly on account of the explicit reference 
contained in the body of the Adbhutasagara 6 ?? itself and in the 
Todarananda, that Laksamanasena came to the throne about 1178-79 
A. D. The Brahmanasarvasva and the Panditsarvasva of Hala- 
yudha are quoted by Raghunandana in the Ahnika ( pp. 389, Jiva- 
nanda, vol. I ), Prayascitta ( pp. 531, vol. I for Panditasarvasva ) and 
other Tattvas. Sourindra Mohan Tagore ( introduction to Kavi- 
rahasya p. HI ) says that Adisura brought to Bengal five Brahmanas 
from Kanoj of whom Bhatta Narayana was the most famous and 
was the author of the Prayogaratna and also of the Venlsaihhara and 
that Halayudha was 16th in descent from that Narayana. These 
traditions of the matchmakers of Bengal and panegyrists of big 
families are entirely worthless for literary and chronological purposes,

particularly for events of comparatively early times. In their zeal 
to extol their patrons 9 families to the skies they were most unscru- 
pulous and threw to the winds all chronology. The Prayogaratna 
was composed at Benares by Bhatta N&r&yana whose family migrat- 
ed from Paithan in the 16th century, while the Ve&Isamhara was 
composed about a thousand years earlier. Yet both works are 
fathered upon Narayana, the ancestor of the rich and influential 
Tagore family. 

There is yet another Halayudha. On the SraddhakalpasCitra of 
Katyayana a commentary called Praka&i was composed by Hala- 
yudha, son of Saftkarsaiia (vide BBRAS cat. No. 518, p. 170). 
In this commentary he refers to Karka, Kamadhenu, Kalpataru, 
Govindaraja, Laksmanopadhyaya, Mitaksara, Saftkhadhara and 
PaSupati. He is therefore later than 1150 A. D. He cannot be 
identified with the author of the Kavirahasya, as the latter flourished 
much earlier under the Rastrakutas. Nor can be the same as the 
jurist Halayudha, since the latter is named in the Kalpataru, which 
in its turn is quoted in the PrakaSa. The dharmadhyaksa of Laksa- 
manasena was a son of Dhananjaya, while the author of the Prakasa 
was a son of Saftkarsana. The SraddhakaSika of Kjrsna ( Gujarati 
Pressed, p. 430) on the Navakandika or Sraddhakalpasutra of Katyi- 
yana says that first Karka 6 ? 8 explained the sutra in pregnant words 
and then Halayudha explained it and yet it remained as difficult as 
before. Kr?na is mentioned in the Nirgayasindhu and the Sraddha- 
mayukha of Nilakaijtha. Therefore Halayudha, the author of the 
Prakasa on Katyayana must have flourished before 1509 A. D. and 
later than 11 50 A. D. 

Vide J. A. S. B. 1915 pp. 327-336 where M. M. Chakravarti 
brought together interesting information about Halayudha. 

73. Bhavadevabhatta 

The Vyavaharatattva of Raghunandana and the Viramitrodaya tell 
us that Bhavadevabhatta composed a work called Vyavaharatilaka on 
judicial procedure. The Vyavaharatattva*?* tells us that Bhavadeva 

<m (P.«07 t vol.II f Jivananda); ip^fa g SW WW^I'flfl 11$ 



SOS JBMory <f BharmaiU*tm 

read 'astavyastapadavyapi* instead of 'yadvyastapadamavy&pi' in 
Katyftyana's verses enumerating the blemishes of uttora ( defendant's 
reply). The Vyavaharatattva 680 mentions Bhavadevabhafla's 
discussion and illustration of a reply (uttara) with a weak plea 
(kirana ). The same work informs us that Bhavadeva held the same 
views on adverse possession as Srikara, Balaka and others did ( vide 
note 624 above). The Vivadacandra of Misarumi£ra* Sl several 
times refers to the views of Bhavadeva. The Vlramitrodaya 68 * gives 
in great detail the remarks of Bhavadeva on the well-known text of 
Sumantu about killing an atatayin. The Sarasvativil&sa 68 ' and the 
Vaijayanti of Nandapancjita quote the very same views of Bhavadeva- 
bhatta on Sumantu's text. 

The foregoing brief discussion shows that Bhavadeva's Vyavahara- 
tiiaka must have been a valuable work on judicial procedure. 
Unfortunately that work has not yet come to light. 

Bhavadeva also wrote several other works. 

In the Deccan College collection there are two Mss. ( No. 9 of 
1895-98 and No. 263 of 1887-91 )of a work of Bhavadeva variously 
named Karmanustfianapaddhati or Dafokarma-paddhati orDa&karma- 
dipika. M. M. Chakravarti in his informing article on Bhavadeva 
( J. A. S. B. 1912, pp. 333-348) says that the work has often been 
printed. I was not able to secure a copy. That work 684 deals with

the ten principal rites and ceremonies to be performed by Brahmaiias 
who study the Samaveda. The principal subjects are : — The Homa 
to the nine planets (Navagraba-boma*), matrpaja, payigrahaw and 
other essential rites of marriage, homa on the fourth day after marriage, 
garbhadhana, pumsavana, simantonnayana, sosyantihoma ( homa 
when a woman is on the point of delivery), jatakarma, ni§kramapa, 
namakararia, annaprasana, cudakararia, upanayana, samavartana 
(the student's returning from the teacher's house after finishing his 
studies), Salakarma ( first entrance in a new house ). 

Another work of Bhavadeva, who is styled Balavalabhi-bhujanga 
therein, is the Prayascittanirupana (I. O. cat. No. 1725 p. 554, 
Mitra's notices, vol. IX, No. 3138, pp. 214-15). In that work he 
mentions over 25 smrtikaras, the Matsya and Bhavisya puranas, 
ViivarQpa, Srikara and Baloka ( ? Balaka ). This work was held in 
high esteem, as the Smrtiratnakara 68 * of Vedacarya places Bhavadeva 
after Manu among the authorities on prayakitta that he follows. 
The Var§a-kriya-kaumudi of Govindananda (B/I. series) quotes a 
text from Bhavadevabhatta on the prayascitta for eating in a solar 
or lunar eclipse (p. 106 ). 

There is yet another work of Bhavadevabhatta called Tautatita- 
matatilak, a ms. of which exists in the India Office ( cat. No. 1591)* 
It is doubtful whether that ms. contains the whole of the work. 
That work is concerned with elucidating the doctrines of the Purva- 
mimamsa system from the standpoint of Kumarilabhatta (who is also 
called Tautatita). From the colophons at the end and elsewhere 
it appears that the work was intended to explain Jaimini I. 4 and II. 
1, but in the body of the work contained in the Ms. only sutras 
from the first pada of the 2nd adhyaya are dwelt upon. Bhavadeva 
is styled Balavalabhibhujanga here also and invokes a terrific curse 686 
upon those who would borrow from his work without acknowledg-

ing their debt. The work opens with the well-known sQtra 
c bh4varthak karmasabdah &c. (Jaimini II. i. i ). It goes on 
explaining the principal topics of Jaimini's 2nd adhyaya, first pada. 
ThesGtras explained are II. i. i, 5, 9, 10, 13, 24, 30-35, 38, 4046- 
49. It mentions the bhasyakara (Sahara), Vartika (folio 12 a), 
Gurumata (17b), Prabhakara (21b), Vartikakarapada (22 b, in 
the plural ). It frequently quotes karikas from the Tantravartika 
with the words 'taduktam.' Hemadri 68 ? quotes Bhavadeva's expla- 
nation of the words of Kumarila allowing an option between jdghanya 
and ajya and disapproves of it. Vide Tri. cat. of Madras Govt. Mss. 
for 1919-1922 p. 5527 for the same work. 

Unexpected light is thrown on the personal history of Bhavadeva- 
bhatta by an inscription found in the temple of Ananta Vasudeva at 
Bhuvanesvara in the Puri District of Orissa edited by Kielhorn in E. I. 
vol. VI, p. 203, which eulogises Bhavadevabhafta, the identity of 
the author Bhavadeva with the person eulogised being established 
by the unique epithet, Balavalabhibhujanga applied to the latter. 688 
The eulogy is composed by a person called Vacaspatikavi. 
Bhavadeva belonged to the Savarna gotra of the Kautkumi school of 
the Samaveda. The family belonged to Siddhalagrama in Radha 
(west of the Hugli and south of the Ganges). Bhavadeva's remote 
ancestor Bhavadeva obtained in gift the agratora of Hastinibhitfa 
from the Gauda king. The father of Bhavadeva was Govardhana, a 
"warrior and a scholar. His mother was Saflgoka, daughter of a 
Vandhyaghatiya Brahmapa. With the advice of Bhavadeva king 
Harivarmadeva is said to have reigned long in prosperity. Bhavadeva 
is stated in the above mentioned inscription to have composed works 
on hord (astrology), smfti, and nnmdthsd. Bhavadeva is eulogised 
as a great builder. He constructed a reservoir of water in Radha, 
he set up a stone image of Narayaija and founded a temple in which 
he placed images of Narayaria, Ananta, ann Nrsimha. He also gave

to Harimedhas female attendants, dug a tank and laid : out a garden. 
Neither Kielhorn nor Chakravarti has attempted any explanation of 
the epithet Balavalabhibhujanga. I hazard an explanation. 
Bhavadeva probably made some innovation in the structure of the 
roofs or balconies of the temples he built and he was therefore 
styled a lover (a gallant or paramour ) of little ( bala-smzW sized or 
girlish) valabhis. From the nature of che character Kielhorn 
conjectured that the inscription belonged to the 12th century A. D. 

The date of Bhavadeva can be approximately settled to be about 
1 100 A. D. as he is quoted by Hemadri, the Vivadacandra of Misaru 
and the Smjtisara of Harinatha. He is certainly earlier than 1200 
A. D. A period of at least half a century must have elapsed before 
a Bengal writer like Bhavadeva came to be looked upon as an autho- 
rity on mimamsa by Hemadri who wrote in distant Berar. It 
appears that he was quoted in the Karmopadesini of Aniruddha 
(I. O. cat. No. 1853, p. 474 ). But that Ms. is bound up with 
another work by a later author and the reference in the cat. is not 
quite clear. If we rely on the Vlramitrodaya, a work called Pradlpa 
criticised the views of Bhavadeva on the verse of Yaj. II. 24 ( about 
adverse possession for 20 and 10 years). Bhavadeva held that twenty 
years' enjoyment of immovable property by a stranger implied that 
the real owner meant to abandon it for the benefit of the stranger 
enjoying it, that such abandonment for the enjoyment of another 
leads to the inference of the extinction of previous ownership and 
that the property being abandoned by the owner in favour of the 
stranger who takes hold of it, ownership also ( of the stranger ) 
arises. The Pradipa 68 ' points out that it does not invariably follow

that, because a srranger is allowed to enjoy land, the owner intends 
to abandon the land for the stranger., nor is it an invariable rule that 
what is abandoned for another becomes the property of that other. 
It will be shown later on that the Pradipa must have been composed 
before 1150 A. D. Hence it follows that Bhavadeva flourished 
about 1 100. He cannot be very much earlier than that, as he is 
not mentioned by any writer of the nth century and as he not 
only mentions Kumarila and Prabhakara, but also writers who 
criticised Prabhakara's views. 

There were several other later persons named Bhavadeva who 
wrote on topics of Dharmasastra such as Bhavadeva, author of 
Danadharmaprakriya ( middle of 17th century ), and Bhavadeva, the 
author of Smrticandrika, who flourished in the first half of the 18th 
century. 

On Bhavadeva's Karmanusfhana-paddhati there is a commentary 
called Sarhsarapaddhatirahasya. 

74. Prakasa. 
A work called Prakasa has been quoted by very early nibandha- 
karas. The Kalpataru quotes the interpretation of Prakasa, Hala- 
yudha and Kamadhenu on a verse of Katyayana. 6 * The Vivada-

( e. g. P- 13 l > x 45> 45^ 4 6o > 4 62 > 474> 4^5* 5<>4 etc ). Frequently 
Prakasa is coupled with Parijata ( e. g. p. 497 ). On page 518 of

Medhatithi are named is cited. 6 * 1 The Danaramakara of Ca?4e-

of the word € Yinevata ' occurring in a passage of Saftkha about the 
fruits allowed in sraddha is quoted. 6 * 3 

These quotations establish that Prakasa was a work that nftt 
only dealt with vyavahara, but also with such topics as dana, 
sraddha etc. 

Whether the Prakasa was an independent work or a commentary 
is somewhat doubtful. But from a passage of the Vivadaratnakara 
it seems to follow that it was a commentary on the Yajnavalkya- 
smjti. There we are told that the Kalpataru 6 ** read 'abhijanata' for 
'avijanata' in Yaj. II. 258, but that since that reading is opposed to 
Yajnavalkya-prakasa, Halayudha and Parijata it must be, regarded as 
a wrong reading. As it is a reading of Yaj. himself that- was being 
discussed, it would be somewhat strange if it were said that it was 
opposed to Yaj. and Prakasa and therefore it is necessary to suppose 
that Yajnavalkyaprakasa is one work. 

The Vivadacintamani in several places gives the explanation of 
PrakaSa.* 9 * The Smrtisara 69 * gives at great length the explanation 
of Prakasa on the controversial verses of Yaj. (II. 138-139). 
The Viramitrodaya 6 *? quotes at length Prakasa's explanation of 
Manu ( 9. 207 ) and disapproves of it on the ground ( among 
others ) that the verse can more clearly be explained so as to convey

a meaning similar to that of Yaj. II. 1 16. The PrakaSa is mentioned 
in the Dayatattva ( vol. II, p. 173 ) and in the Suddhitattva (vol. II, 
p. 288 ). 

As the Prakasa is quoted in the Kalpataru it is certainly earlier 
than 1 125. It mentions Medhatithi. Besides the Mit. does not 
refer to it. There is room for thinking that it follows the Mit. 
Yaj. II. 116 is, according to the Vivadaratnakara/* 8 explained by the 
Prakasa in almost the same words as the Mit. It is possible that 
both borrow from the same original. At all events the Praka£a 
must have been composed between 1000 and 1100 A. D. 

Hemadri frequently cites a work called Maharnavaprakafe/w 
According to the latter the sandal unguents, flowers, incense, lamp 
presented in sraddha are to be offered to the Brahmaoas invited and 
not to the pitrs. In another place Hemadri quotes the explanation 
of the word * nimantra\ia * ?°° given by the Maharnavapraka&u In 
some places Hemadri refers to a work called Smrtimaharnava or 
simply Maharnava.? 01 It appears to me that all these three are the 
names of the same work. The question then arises whether the 
Smrtimaharnavaprakasa is the same as the PrakaSa mentioned by the 
Kalpataru and Candesvara. In the present state of our knowledge 
it appears that they are identical. The Madanaparijata (p. 93) 
quotes a verse from the Smrtimaharnava about upakarma. 

75. Parijata. 

Several works bear the appellation Parijata such as the Vidhana- 
parijata (composed in 1625 A. D. ), the Madanaparijata (about 
1375 A. D. ) and the Prayogaparijata (between 1400-1500 ). But

there was an ancient work called Parijata quoted by even some , of 
the earliest nibatidhakdras. The Kalpataru several times quotes 
the views of a work called Parijata. The Praka£a and Parijata are 
frequently mentioned? 02 together in the Kalpataru and the Vivada- 
ratnakara. The latteJ regarded the Kalpataru, Parijata, Halayudha 
andPrakasaasits most eminent predecessors.' * The Dinaratna- 
kara 704 quotes several times the views, of Parijata on gifts. The 
Smrtisara of Harinatha sets out at length the order of succession to 
a sonless man according to the Parijata ( vide I. O. Ms. No. 301, 
folio 134 a ). One of the striking opinions of the Parijata was that 
the widow of a sonless man should raise offspring by niyoga and 
give the wealth of the deceased to the son so born. 

From the above it appears that the Parijata was an independent 
work on vyavahdra, dana and other topics. Being quoted by the 
Kalpataru it was earlier than 1125 A. D. and as it held views 
similar to those of Bhojadeva and Halayudha on the widow's rights 
and as it is not quoted by the Mit. or other earlier works it must be 
assigned to a date between 1000-1 125 A. D. In I. L. R. 12 Cal. 348 
at p. 356 the learned judges hold that the Parijata frequently cited as 
an authority by the Vivadaratnakara is the Madanaparijata. But 
this is entirely wrong. The latter work, it will be shown ( vide 
sec - 93 )> was composed about 1375, while the Vivadaratnakara 
was composed about 1320 A. D. Hence the Parijata of the Vivada- 
ratnakara is the ancient work mentioned in the Kalpataru.

Dr., Jolly in the Manutfkasaihgraha. In his commentary? * on 
Manu III. 247 and 248 he tells us that he has treated at greater 
length the subject of those verses in his own work called Smrti- 
manjari. Kulluka? * in his comment on Manu IV. 212 twits 
Govindaraja with having explained € ugra' in one way in his com- 
mentary on Manu and in a different way in his Manjari. A Ms. 
of a portion of the Smrtimanjarl exists in the India Office ( cat. 
p. 471 )• 

From these two works a brief account of the personal history 
of Govindaraja can be extracted. The colophons at the end of the 
Manutfka describe Govindaraja as the son of bhafta Madhava. The 
first verse? ? of the Smrtimanjari and one at the end ( though some- 
what corrupt ) give the information that he was the son of Madhava 
and grand-son of Narayana and appears to have lived on the holy 
banks of the Ganges.? 08 Those who like Sarvadhikari identify 
Govindaraja with Govindacandra, prince of Benares, are therefore 
entirely wrong since he was a Brahmaga and not a Ksatriya. The 
first verse7°? of his Manutfka contains an obeisance to god ( or Siva ) 
and states that he had received the Sastra of Manu in an unbroken 
tradition of teacher and pupil and that he had examined previous 
commentaries of Manu.

The Smrtis mentioned by him in the two works of his are given 
below* 710 Besides he mentions the Vayupurana (on Manu III. 232) 
and Puraija in general ( on Manu I. 74 and 80 ). He frequently 
quotes the Grhyasfitras, also the Bahvrcagrhyapari£i§ta, the Yoga- 
sfetra. He says ( on Manu 2. 23 ) that Mleccha countries like 
Andhra and others were not fit for performing sacrifices. He 
appears to have held like Medhatithi the view that tnokfa was to be 
attained by a combination of jhana and karma J 11 As compared 
with the bhasya of Medhatithi his commentary is very concise. 
Kullflka largely drew upon Medhatithi and Govindaraja, mentions 
them hundreds of times, criticizes?" both of them and particularly 
holds up Govindaraja to ridicule often enough. ?'* Kulluka notes 
that Govindaraja in opposition to Medhatithi and Bhojadeva 
arranged Manu 8. 181- 184 differently ( putting 8. 182 as the last of 
those four verses ). In the printed edition there is no comment of 
Govindaraja on the verses of the 9th chapter from verse 72. But it 
appears that the Dayabhaga had that part of the commentary, as 
it quotes the views of Govindaraja on the rights of the daughter's 
son which could have appeared only on Manu IX. 130-136. 

A few words may now be said about tbe Smrtimanjari, Mss. of 
which are rare. At the end of the India office Ms. a summary of 
the contents of the whole work is given ( for which see footnote

topics of dharmasastra such as the samskaras, the daily duties viz :

the forest hermit, and the sathnydsin, the duties of the] four varyas, 
gifts, the purifications of various materials, fcods forbidden and 
allowed, impurity on birth and death, sapindas and santaticdakas, 
funeral rites, iraddha and its various details, prayaScitta. The ms. 
in the India office deals with the adhikdrl for prayascitta, the parsat 
( i. e. the assembly of learned men who are to determine what 
prayascitta is to be prescribed ), the means of atoning for sins and 
violations of religious duties, the prayakittas for the mah&patakas 
(viz. the murder of a Brahmana, drinking wine, theft of 
gold, incest ) and for other lesser and similar sins, meaning 
of the word prayascitta, praya&ittas for killing men of Ksatriya, 
Vaiiya and &udra classes and for killing women, prayascittas 
for the killing of a cow and of various beasts and birds, prayas- 
cittas for eating forbidden or polluted food and for selling articles 
forbidden to be sold, secret prayascittas. The India Office Ms. 
which deals only with prayakittas contains 152 folios. This gives 
us an idea as to how extensive the whole work must have been

The Vyavaharamatrki as its very name implies deals with the 
elements of vyavahara ( i. e. judicial procedure )• It speaks of the 
eighteen titles of law, the derivation of the word pradvivaka( judge), 
the persons fit to be appointed judges, different grades of courts, 
duties of sabhyas, four stages of vyavahara, pfcrvapak§a ( plaint ), 
pratibhu ( surety ), blemishes in a plaint, tittara ( reply of the 
defendent ), four kinds of uttara, blemishes in uttara, kriya ( proof 
or burden of proof), divine ( daivi ) and human ( mdnufi ) proof 
(viz : (frdeals, inference, witnesses, documents, possession), persons 
incompetent to be witnesses. Ordeals have not been dealt with by 
the author. The first verse of the work?* 1 styles it Vyavahara- 
matrka. The last verse™ 2 but one suggests the name Nyayamatrka 
which practically is a synonym of Vyavahara-matrka and the 
colophon at the end of a ms. in the Deccan College collection calls 
it Nyayaratnamalika. 

About twenty smrtikaras?*' are mentioned in the Vyavahara- 
matrka. Katyayana, Brhaspati and Narada are the three smrtikaras 
most frequently quoted, nearly two-thirds of the quotations in the 
entire work being derived from them. Among the nibandhakaras 
the following are named :— Jitendriya, Dik§ita, ( p. 302 ), Bala 
( p. 346, the same as Balaka ), Bhojadeva ( pp. 284, 305 ), Manjari- 
kara ( i. e. Govindaraja ), Yogloka, Visvarupa, Ankara ( pp. 292, 
334 or Srikaramisra p. 342 ). About Visvarupa he says*** ' I have

refuted the objections of ViSvarfipa an4 others and dealt with them 

at length. ' Yogloka and Srikara are generally quoted for being 

refuted and the former is frequently jeered at as ( tarkikaxh-manya * 

or ' nava-tarkikam-manya \ In this work Jimutavahana displays 

, great familiarity with the ancient dialectics. In some cases what 

the printed text exhibits?** as prose really constitutes verses. Sir 

Asutosh Mukerji is not accurate when he says in the preface that 

' Jimutavahana refers to a number of jurists not mentioned by any 

other author, e. g. Jitendriya, Yogloka, Balaka, Visvarupa, Srikara 

and Manjarlkara.' It has been shown above that both ViSvarupa 

and Srikara have been mentioned by the Mit. which i* certainly 

earlier than Jimutavahana and by a host of other writers who were 

either earlier than or contemporaries of Jimutavahana. The 

Vyavaharamatrka is quoted in, the Vyavahartattva 746 ( pp. 199, 214, 

vol. II ) and the Dayatattva of Raghunandana. 

The Dayabhaga is the most famous of Jimutavahana's works. 
In matters of Hindu law such as inheritance, partition, stridhana, 
re-union, it is of paramount authority in modern British Indian 
courts in Bengal, except in those cases where the Mitaksara is 
applicable. The names of more than a dozen commentators of it 
are known and Pandit Bharatacandra Siromani published it with 
seven commentaries ( 1863-1866 ). It was translated into English 
by Colebrooke. In many editions ( such as that of Jivananda ) it 
is divided into sections though there were no divisions in the 
original work. The contents of the Dayabhaga are : — Definition 
of <iaya ; father's power over ancestral property ; partition of father's 
and grand-father's property ; division among brothers after their 
father's death ; definition, classification and devolution of stridhana ; 
persons excluded from inheritance and partition on the ground of 
disabilities ; property which is impartible (in its very nature or 
because it is self-acquired ) ; order of succession to one dying sonless; 
re-union, partition of coparcenery property concealed but discover- 
ed afterwards, indicia of partition.

Some of the peculiar doctrines of the Dayabh&ga which are of 
fundamental importance and which sharply distinguish it from the 
Mit. are : sons have no interest in ancestral property by birth, 
sons can claim partition only after extinction of theit father's 
ownership ( i. e. after his death or on his becoming patita or a 
sathny&sin ) or partition can take place between father and sons if 
the father so desires, a widow succeeds to her husband's interest 
on his death even if he be joint with his brother, the right to take 
a deceased person's estate is regulated by the spiritual benefit con- 
ferred by the person claiming as heir ( by means of the offering of 
pilrfas )and not by the principle of consanguinity (asintheMit.).747 

Besides the smrtikaras," 8 the Mahabharata and the Markapdeya- 
purapa the following authors are referred to by name in the Daya- 
bhaga :— Udgrahamalla, Govindaraja (as author of Manutika), Jiten- 
driya, Diksita, Balaka, Bhojadeva or Dharesvara, ViSvarupa and 
Srikara. Udgrahamalla is referred to on the distribution of 
stridhana and it is said that Udgrahamalla ( i. e. his view ) is 
throttled?** by the text of Devala. It appears therefore that Udgra- 
hamalla was not a smjti writer, but a nibandhakdra. Diksita?* is 
credited with the view that, among daughters, those who have 
sons or are likely to have sons are preferred to those who are either 
barren, widowed or who give birth to daughters alone and the 
Dayabhaga approves of this yiew. There is one more writer who 
is referred to twice with great respect as Niravadyavidyoddyota.

Whether this is a mere description or title ('the refulgence of whose 
learning is spotless ') or whether the author's name was Uddyota and 
niravadyvidya ( f whose learning is spotless ' ) is an epithet, it is 
difficult to say. For a correct knowledge of the origin and develop- 
ment of the theory of spiritual benefit propounded in the Dayabhaga, 
it would be extremely desirable to know who this writer was, as 
JimGtavahana tells us that that view was brilliantly set forth by Nirava- 
dyavidyoddyota. The same writer is also quoted on the well known 
verse of Yajnavalkya € bhurya pitamahopatta &c, ' which is the 
sheet-anchor of Vijiianesvara's theory about the son's rights by 
birth in ancestral family property.?* l 

Jlmtitavahana gives very little information about himself. In 
the colophons of his works he is described as Paribhadriya Maha- 
mahopadhyaya and at the end of the Vyavaharamatjka ( vide note 
742 above ) he tells us that he was born of the Paribhadra family 
( kula ).*** It is said that this name of the family still survives in 
the Parihal or Pari Gai, a section of Radhlya Brahmanas ( Ghose's 
Hindu Law, 3rd edition, pp. xvi-xviii and JASB 191 5 p. 320). 
It is also said that Edumisra in his Kulakarika tells us that Jimuta- 
vahana was chief judge in the reign of Visvak-sena of Bengal and 
that he was 9th in descent from Narayanabhatta, one of the five 
Brahmanas brought by Adisura. The information supplied by the 
match-makers of Bengal is, as shown above, not worth reliance, 
unless corroborated by independent evidence. It is also said that 
for fourteen generations the Brahmanas of Parigrama have been 
degraded and so Jimutavahana would not have paraded the fact 
that he was Paribhadriya if at the time when he wrote his subcaste 
had been degraded ( Intro, to Kalaviveka p. vm ). The fact that 
Jimutavahana was a native of Radha is testified by his statement 
in the Kalaviveka that Agastya ( Canopus ) rose in Ujjayini 

752 In eome editions of the ^TOFTm, the last verte !■ MlRHM^&rft «faHI 



78. JlmWavabona SW 

when four days of the month of Bhadrapada remained, but that in 
Radha Agastya rose when seven days of the month were yet to 
run.™ 

Extremely divergent views have been held as to the date of 
Jimutavahana. He has been assigned to various dates from the nth 
to the 1 6th century. In L. R. 41 I. A. at p. 298 it is said by their 
Lordships of the Privy Council that the Mit. was earlier by five 
centuries than Jimutavahana. Dr. Jolly ( R. u. S. p. 37 ) assigns 
him to the 15th century. For a statement of the various dates 
and their examination the article of M. M. Chakravarti in 
JASB. for 191 5, pp. 3217327 and Mr. Panchanan Ghosh's 
learned article in 26 Calcutta Law Journal ( journal portion 
p. 17 ff. ) may be consulted. Since Jimfitavahana mentions Dhare- 
svara Bhojadeva and Govindaraja, he cannot be placed earlier than 
the last quarter of the 1 ith century. Since he is quoted by Sula- 
pani, Vacaspati-mi&ra and Raghunandana, he cannot be later than 
the middle of the 15th century. The Kalaviveka furnishes impor- 
tant data. On a ms. of the Kalviveka there is a note made about 
the birth-date of the son of a certain Ghafakasimha with the horo- 
scope of the child. The year specified therein is iake 14 17, i. e. 
149 j A. D. It follows from this that the Ms. itself must have been 
copied .ometime before this and the original work must be much 
earlier still. So the Kalaviveka cannot be placed at any rate later 
than about 1400 A. D. 

In the Kalaviveka Jimfltavahana tells us that his predecessor 
Andhuka" 4 exhibited a certain astronomical matter in lake 952 (i. e. 
1030 A. D. ) and that he declared an intercalary month in iake 955, 

Similarly Jimutavahana expatiates upon several?" minute astro-

nomical and astrological details which were observed in the iahe 
years 1013 and 1014 ( i. e. 109 1 and 1092 A. D. ). It is impossible 
to supposse that an author would enter into such minute details 
about a time which was anterior to his own by centuries. Generally 
astronomical works take for their calculations starting points or 
years which were within their own experience or very nearly so. 
Therefore it appears to be a sound conclusion to hold that the 
K&laviveka was composed soon after iahe 1013 or 1014 ( i. e. 1091 
and 1092 A. D. ). Hence it follows that the literary activity of 
Jimfltavahana lay between 1090 and 11 30 A. D. The Kalaviveka 
seems to be his first work. The Vyavaharamatrka would- naturally 
come before the Dayabhaga. He seems to have contemplated 
writing 756 on ro&dana also, as he says in the Dayabhaga that a certain 
matter would be expounded by him in njadana. 

The most cogent argument that can be advanced against the 
above early date assigned to Jimutavahana is that neither Jimuta- 
vahana nor any of his compositions is mentioned by Bengal writers 
and works on DharmasSstra belonging to the 12th, 13th and 14th 
centuries such as the Haralata, the commentary of Kulluka etc. 
No satisfactory explanation can be offered of this silence. But is is 
a very precarious thing to conclude from this silence that Jimflta- 
vahana's works did not exist during those centuries. It is safer to 
base conclusions about his date on the positive evidence contained 
in his works rather than rely upon the negative argument from 
silence in later works. When some of his commentators say that 
he criticises the views of Candesvara, Misra and others we should 
not take them seriously. The commentators had no idea of the 
exact chronological position of writers long anterior to them. All 
they mean is that Jimutavahana criticises views that were shared 
also by Capdesvara and others. Another important question is 
whether Jimutavahana who is certainly a little later than the Mit.

78. JimQtavOhatta &7 

criticizes it. The Vivada-tlndava of?" Kamalakara says that Jimfita- 
vahana held that the view about the equal ownership of father and 
son in ancestral property was put forward for precluding the possi- 
bility #f the uncle taking the whole estate of a man dying (in union) 
leaving a son or a predeceased son's son or for precluding the possi- 
bility of an unequal distribution of ancestral property by a father 
among his sons and that Jimutavahana took up this position, being 
blinded by his hatred of the Mit. The Viramitrodaya 7 * 8 also says 
that Jimutavahana criticizes the Mitaksara definition of vibhdga and 
the view of the Mit. about the times for partition. The Vyavahara- 
mitrka 7 * 9 also appears to criticizes several times views which were 
held by the Mit. and the correspondence is very striking. On this 
point this much may be said that the points selected for attack by 
Jimutavahana do occur almost in the same words in the Mit. but, 
since the Mit. is not expressly mentioned and since it is likely that 
other writers like Asahaya and Bharuci whose works have not yet 
been discovered might have contained the very same words that are 
found in the Mit., it is somewhat hazardous to assert that Jimuta- 
vahana criticizes the Mit. alone and no other work. All that one 
can advance is that it is quite within the bounds of possibility that 
Jimutavahana criticizes the Mit.

79. Apararka 

On the smrti of Yajnavalkya Aparaditya wrote a voluminous com- 
mentary styled Apararka-Yajnavalkiya-dharmasastra-nibandha ( pub- 
lished in two volumes by the Anandasrama Press, Poona, 1903 and 
1904 ). In a verse? 60 at the end and in the colophons the author 
is called Aparaditya, a Silahdra king, born in the family of Jimttta- 
vahana of the Vidyadhara race. In the introductory?* 1 fifth verse 
also the author is styled 'an ornament of the family of Jimuta' 
and is highly eulogised for his devotion to Siva and his brilliant 
intellect. 

Apararka's work, like the Mitaksara, though professedly a com- 
mentary on Yaj., is really in the nature of a digest. It is far more 
voluminous than the Mit. It quotes profusely from the Grhya and 
Dharma sutras and the metrical smrtis. Several features distinguish 
it from the Mit. The Mit. is generally very chary of quoting from 
the puranas, while Apararka contains long extracts sometimes 
extending over pages from several purapas, viz, the Adipurapa, the 
Adityapuraria, the Kurma, the Kalikapura^a, Devi, Nandi, Nrsimha, 
Padma, Brahma, Brahmaqda, Bhavi§yat, Bhavisyottara, Matsya, 
Markagdeya, Liftga, Varaha, Vamana, Viyu, Vi§pu, Visijudhar- 
mottara, Sivadharmottara, Skanda. The index at the end of the 
printed Apararka gives the names of the various smjrtikaras quoted 
in the work. Another feature not found in the Mit* is thai 
Apararka quotes long passages of the dharmasfitras and explains 
them at length, e. g. on Yaj. Ill 294 ( p. 1205 ) he quotes Gautama 
( Dh. S. 20. 2-9 ) and then offers a lengthy explanation ; on Yaj. 
III. 294-295, he quotes long passages of Vasistha (Dh. S.15. u-i4and 
17-21) and gives detailed explanations of them. It is probable he had 
not before him commentaries on these dharmastitras. On p. 11, he

gives brief summaries in the style of the SaAkarabbasya of the tenets 
of th? Saiva, Pasupata, Pancaratra, Samkhya and Yoga systems. He 
does iot appear to'have been an ardent admirer of the Advaita Vedanta 
though he refers to the Sarirakamimamsa.? 62 In one place he sets 
out the arguments of those who hold that correct knowledge alone 
leads to tnokfa and of those who hold that a combination of correct 
knowledge and works is essential for mokja and leaves his readers to 
choose for themselves whatever view they take.? 6 * It is remarkable 
that, while ever the Mit. names at least six nibandhakaras on 
dharmasastra viz. Asahaya, Visvarupa, Bharuci, Ankara, Medhatithi 
and Dharesvara, Apararka observes a studied silence in the matter 
of citing the names of his predecessors. He employs such vague 
expressions as kecit, anye, apare, though he cites views that were 
ascribed by the Mit. and others to Dharesvara and others, e. g. on 
pp. 741-42 he says 764 that the text of Yaj. 'patnl duhitarab' according 
to some refers to the widow who submits to niyoga (this is the view of 
Dharesvara); on p. 744 he refers to the view of some that the word 
duhitr in Yaj. means only the appointed daughter (putrikd). 
This last was the view of Visvarupa and Srikara. On p. 761 he 
refers to the reading of some in Yaj. II. 150 as 'samantasthaviraganafr' 
which is found in Visvarupa (II. 154) and not in the Mit. Apararka 
names ( p. 926 ) a Vagbhata-smytisarhgraha and a Smrtimimamsa of 
Jaimini ( p. 206 ) from which two verses are quoted, variant 
readings therein are noticed and detailed explanations thereof are 
offered. He refers to several works and authors on astronomy and 
astrology such as Garga, Kriyasraya ( p. 872 ), Saravali. On 
pp. 570 and 572 of the printed text occur two references to a 
pustaka of rajanaka Sitikantha.' 6 * That was probably a marginal

note in a ms., the copyist or owner of which found on comparison 
with another ms. belonging to rajanaka Sitikafltha additional matter. 
Apararka quotes from Bha«a ( i. e. Kumarilabhatta ).? 66 Apararka 
does not appeal as frequently to the doctrines of the Purvamimathsa 
as the Mit. does and he does not generally enter into acute dis- 
cussions of Purvamimamsa in its application to Dharma&stra as the 
Mit. does. It must be said that Apararka is much inferior to the 
Mit. in lucid exposition, in dialectic skill, in subtelty of argument 
and in the ordered presentation of heterogenous material. 

Some of the views that are usually associated with Jlmutavahana 
were propounded by Apararka also. Apararka bases the right to 
take a deceased person's property on the superior spiritual benefit 
conferred by the claimant on the person deceased. ? 6 7 In several 
other respects also Apararka differs from the Mit., though in general 
the two closely agree. For example, Apararka prefers the father 
over the mother as an heir ( p. 745 ) ; Apararka explains the word 
' apratisthita ' in Gautama's text ( 18. 22 ) as ' one who is issue- 
less or is indigent or a widow, ' while the Mit. explains it to mean 
only c indigent. ' 

Whether Apararka knew the Mit. is a vexed question. Som§ 
scholars while holding that Apararka does criticize the Mit. explain 
away the non-mention of the Mit. by saying that Indian etiquette 
required a royal author not to mention the name of the servant of 
another king, while the existence of the master himself was ignored 
( Dr. Jolly in Journal of Indian History vol. Ill p. 17 ). It is doubt- 
ful whether any such etiquette ever existed and further Apararta. 
studiously avoids the express mention of every ancient commentator. 
Works of royal authors, such as the Madanparijata or the 
Sarasvativilasa, do not appear to have followed the etiquette. In

first word as a karmadharaya compound, gives the explanation of 
this verse offered by others, disapproves of it and then says that 
others read * Sruticodanat ' for 'sruticoditah'.? 68 Visvarupa reads 
'vaitanikasrayah. . . srutidarsanat' and offers no comment on this 
verse beyond the word 'spastarthametat' ( it is III. 15. in the 
Trivandrum ed. ). The Mit. does contain the reading referred to 
by Apararka and the stuti passage ' yavaj-jivam ' etc. Apararka 
refers on Yaj. III. 254 to the reading 'samam'7 6 9 adopted by some, 
says that the latter explain the verse as prescribing the penance for 
three years and observes that the verse of Manu ( IX. 92 ) does not 
apply, as the latter say, to him alone whose palate has merely come 
in contact with liquor ( without his having actually swallowed it ).

years* penance nor does he refer to the contact of wine with the 
palate. The Mit. however contains both these particulars. On 
p. 1084 also?? Apararka seems to be referring to the view of theMit. 

The date of Apararka can be settled within very narrow limits. 
The Smrticandrika?? 1 in several places quotes the views of Apararka 
and sometimes contrasts them with those of the Mit. The Smrti- 
candrika refutes the view of Apararka that the words of Yaj. 
' jyestharii va sresthabhagena ' are meant to comprehend all various 
modes of giving an additional share ( uddharavibhaga ) to the eldest 
son on partition mentioned by Manu and others and it follows 
Apararka's explanation of c apratisthita ' in Gautama's text. It will 
be shown later on that the Smrticandrika must have been composed 
about 1200 A. D. If the above conclusion that Apararka knew the 
Mit. and criticizes it be correct, Apararka must have flourished after 
1 100 A. D. and before 1200 A. D. Here epigraphical research 
comes to our help. We know from the commentary that the 
author Aparaditya was a Silahara prince of Jimutavahana's family. 
Inscriptions of the Silaharas show that there were three branches 
of that family, one ruling in the northern Konkan at Thana, the 
second in the southern Konkan and the third at Kolhapur ( vide 
JBBRAS, vol. XIII p. 10-17 for the three branches). All the 
branches traced their descent from Jlmutavahana. There is only a 
single inscription of the second branch which had ten kings reigning 
from about 808 to 1008 A. D. (JBBRAS vol. I, p. 209, E. I. vol. III. 
p. 292 ). There is no Aparaditya in this line. Vide E. I. Ill p. 207.

79. AparSrln 335 

of the northern Silaharas speak of two kings who are named Apara- 
dityadeva. In JBBRAS vol. XXI, pp. 505-516 there is a grant 
dated iake 1049 ( expired ) of Aparadityadeva who donated a village 
named Vadavali in the Thana District to a brahmana studying the 
Madhyandina recension of the Vajasaneya-samhita. The king is 
there styled once as Aparajita and several times as Aparadityadeva. 
He was son of Anantadeva and grand-son of Nagarjuna and traced 
his descent to Jimutavahana, son of Jimutaketu, far famed in legend 
and literature as an exemplar of self-sacrifice?? 2 , e. g. in the drama 
Nagananda. In this inscription Aparadityadeva is styled Sil&h&rana- 
rcndra and Jlmatavdhandnvayaprasuta as in the colophon of the com- 
mentary on Yaj. ( vide note 760 above ) and also Mabamnndale- 
ivara and Tagarapuraparameivara. In the Annals of the Bhandarkar 
Institute, vol. V, part 2, p. 169 there is a grant made at Somnath- 
Papm in Kathiawar of Vikramsarhvat 1176 ( 11 19-20 A. D. ) while 
Aparadityadeva of the &lahara family was reigning, almost in the 
same words as in the grant in JBBRAS vol. XXI p. 505. In I. A, 
vol. IX, p. 33 there is a grant of Anantadeva father of Aparadityadeva 
dated in iake 1016 (i. e. 1094-5 A. D. ). Vide Bombay Gazetteer 
vol. I. part 2, p. 15 for a list of 20 kings of the northern Konkan 
branch from 810 to 1260 A. D. Vide also an inscription of Apara- 
dityadeva dated sake 105 1 (i. e. 11 29 A. D. ) in Festgabe 
Dr. Jacobi pp. 189-193 ( 1926 ). Therefore it appears that the dates 
of Aparadityadeva I referred to in these grants fall between 11 15 and 
1 1 30 A. D. It was most probably this king who composed the 
commentary on Yaj. We know from the Srikanthacarita of MaAkha 
that king Aparaditya 773 of Konkan sent Tejakaptha on an embassy 
to an assembly of learned men in Kashmir during the reign of 
Jayasimha of Kashmir ( 1129 to 1150A. D. ). Apararka's com- 
mentary continues to be the standard law-book used by the pandits 
of Kashmir ( Jolly's Tagore Law lectures p. 24 ). Apararka's work

betrays familiarity with Kashmir. I have already noticed the 
reference to rajanaka Sitikantha above. On a passage from Brahma- 
purana speaking of a sraddha at Martandapadamula, Apararka notes 
( P- 9°3 ) that?? 4 the latter is well known in Kashmir. It is there- 
fore most probable that the work was composed about 1125 an d 
was introduced into Kashmir when an embassy was sent from the 
Konkan king to Kashmir in the reign of Jayasimha. The dates of 
the second Aparaditya range from n 84 to 1187 A. D. ( Vide 
Bombay Gazetteer vol. XIII, part 2, p. 427 ; JBBRAS vol. XII, 
pp. 333-335 for an inscription of Aparaditya dated 1109 iake i. e. 
1 1 87 A. D. (wherein he is styled KoAkana-cakravarti ). It is 
difficult to hold that this was the author of the commentary on Yaj. 
The Smrticandrika is mentioned by Hemadri and hence could not 
be later than the first quarter of the thirteenth century. Therefore 
if Apararka who is frequently cited by the Smrticandrika were to 
be regarded as having flourished about 1187 A. D., very little 
distance is left between him and the Smrticandrika in order that 
the former should come to be looked upon as an authority by the 
latter. Therefore it appears probable that Apararka wrote the com- 
mentary on Yaj. in the first half of the 12th century ( about 
1 125 A. D. ). Vide Tri. cat. Mad. Govt. Mss. for 1919-22, 
pp. 4853-54, for the Nyayamuktavali of Aparadityadeva, which is a 
com. on the Nyayasara of Bhasarvajiia. 

80. Pradipa 

The Smrtyarthasara of Sridhara enumerates the Pradipa among 
its authorities after the Kamadhenu.™* The Smrticandrika in 
a highly paronomastic verse appears to refer to a work called 
Pradipa." 6 The Sarasvativilasa"? quotes the view of the Pradipa

that even the suretyship debt of a person must be paid by his grand- 
son. The Jivatpitrkanirriaya?? 8 of Ramakrsna ( about 1600 A. D. ) 
quotes the Pradipa on the question that when brothers are separat- 
ed they should perform separately the annual sraddha of their father 
and other ancestors. Nandapandita in his commentary on the"? 
Sada£lti cites the view of the Pradipa that the sutra of Paithinasi 
( a woman delivered of a son bathing after twenty nights from 
delivery is entitled to perform all religious rites, while one who is 
delivered of a female child is so entitled after a month ) applies to 
the wife of one who is not a dikfita ( one who has consecrated the 
Vcdic fires ). It has been shown above ( note 689 ) how the 
Pradipa criticizes Bhavadeva,- according to the Viramitrodaya, 
which in several places cites the views of the Pradipa ( vide pp. 78, 
89, 215 &etc. ). 

The foregoing discussion shows that the Pradipa was probably 
an independent work on vyavahara, sraddha, suddhi and other topics. 
Being mentioned by the Smrtyarthasara and Smyticandrika, it 
cannot be later than about 1150 A. D. As it criticizes Bhavadeva 
it cannot be earlier than 11 00 A. D. 

Hemadri? 80 refers to the explanation of the word kald occurring 
in a text of Gargya offered by a Smripradipa. It is not unlikely 
that he means the same work as is referred to by others as Pradipa. 

81. The Smrtyarthasara of Sridhara 

This well-known work was published by the Anandasrama Press, 
Poona, in 19 12 A. D. The principal topics discussed by it are : 
the acts allowed in former ages but forbidden in the kali age ; the 
number of sathstoras, the detailed treatment of Upanayatia, the

duties of Brahmacarin, holidays, marriage, its various forms, pro- 
hibitions on the ground of sapipda relation, discussion about gotra 
and pravara, daily duties such as iauca, acamana, brushing the teeth, 
bathing, the five yajnas, daily samdhya, daily worship ; detailed 
treatment of irdddba, proper time, articles, and brahmanas to be 
invited at it, various kinds of irdddba, discussion about various 
tithis ; intercalary month ; forbidden and allowed food ; purification 
of various substances and of one's own body; impurity on birth 
and death ; rites after death ; rules about sathnydsa ; prayascittas for 
various grades of sins and lapses. 

From the colophon it appears that Sridhara was himself a per- 
former of Vedic sacrifices and was the son of Nagabhartr Vi§nu- 
bhatta of the ViSvamitra gotra. This colophon does not however 
occur in the ancient ms. of the work in the Deccan College collection 
( No. 44 of 1870-71 ) dated sathvat 1495 (1438-39 A. D. ). In the 
2nd introductory verse ( vide note 564 above ) the author tells 
us that Srikantha and Srikaracarya filled the gaps in the smrtis that 
were scattered about ( i. e. they composed digests thereof with 
their own remarks ). He also says (vide note 651 above ) that 
he relies on the Kamadhenu, the Pradipa, the Abdhi, the Kalpa- 
vrksa ( i. e. Kalpataru ), Kalpalata, Sambhu, Dravida, Kedara and 
Lollata and the various commentators of Manu and other smrti- 
karas. In dealing with sathnydsa he says that he would treat of the 
procedure of sathnydsa following the opinion of Govindai&ja and 
of Baudhayana.? 81 At the beginning of some sections ( p. 48 and 
p. 49 on irdddba and prdyaicitta respectively ) he again repeats 
the verse about Kamadhenu and the other authorities. The 
Abdhi named therein seems to be the s*jirtimaharnava quoted in 
Hemadri, in the Vivadaratnakara and other works. He refers to 
Mitaksara also ( p. 56). For Lollata see above ( under Medha- 
tithi ). It appears that Sridhara also composed another and a 
larger work on dharmasastra. For example, Hemadri who? 8 * knew

81. The Smttyarthaeara of &ridhara 387 

the Smpyarthasara quotes certain views as Sridhara's which do not 
occur in the Smjrtyarthasara. The Prayogaparijata, the Nirnaya- 
sindhu, and the Samskarakaustubha quote the views of a work 
called Sridhariya which are not found in the Smjrtyarthasara. 
Sridhara seems to have been a writer from southern India. 

The date of the Smrtyarthasfira can be fixed within approximate 
limits. As it names the Mit., the Kamadhenu, the Kalpataru and 
Govindaraja, it is later than 1150 A. D. The Smrticandrika and 
Hemadri 78 * both quote it as an authority. For example, the Smrti- 
candrika says that the Smjrtyarthasara holds that the Tulasi is 
among the things the use of which is to be avoided in sraddha* 
Therefore the Smjrtyarthasara must have been composed between 
1 1 50 and 1200 A. D. 

82. Aniruddha 

Aniruddhabhatta is one of the early and eminent Bengal writers 
on Dharmasastra. His Haralata was published in the Bibliothcca 
Indica series ( 1909 ) and his Pitrdayita alias Karmopadesimpaddhati 
was recently published by the Sanskrit Sahitya Parishad at Calcutta 
(No 6). 

The Haralata deals with impurity on birth and death, with the 
acts allowed to be done or forbidden during impurity, with periods

The Pitrdayita is a work intended for the followers of the 
Samaveda. Its contents are : — the duties on rising from bed, 
brushing the teeth, bath, sariidhya, tarpaya, vaisvadeva, parvaya- 
irdddba, eulogy of gifts, sapindikarana and other sraddhas, antyesti 
and rites during the days of mourning after death, the letting loose 
of a bull. The printed work appears to be the same that is described 
in the I. O. cat. at p. 474 as Karmopadesini. But the India Office 
Ms. appears to have certain various readings e. g. a reference to 
Kamadhenu and Kalpataru at the end of the section on antyesti 
does not occur in the printed text. 78 *. 

The first verse of the Haralata states that the author consulted 
the commentaries on Manu and other smrtis. 78 * Besides the well- 
known smrtikaras such as Manu, Yajnavalkya, Narada etc., the 
authors and works named in the Haralata are : — Asahaya as the 
Bhasyakdra of Gautama, Kamadhenu, Govindaraja, Bhojadeva, 
Visvarupa and Sankhadhara. The Pitrdayita? 8 * says that it was 
composed after consulting the Gobhilagrhyasutra, the Chandogyapari- 
sista, the smrtis, puranas, the sastras of Gautama and Vasistha and 
various samgraha. works. In the work itself, besides the above. 
Katyayana, Varahapurana and the smaller (svalpa) Matsyapurapa are 
quoted. 

From the last verse 787 of the Haralata wc know that Aniruddha 
^yas a resident of Viharapataka on the bank of the Ganges and was

8B. Aniruddha 339 

t student of the doctrines of Bhatfa (Kumarila). From the colophons? 88 
at the end of the Haralata and the Pitrdayita it appears that he was a 
Dharmadhyak§a and a Campahattlya ( a section among Varendras ) 
Brahmaiia of Bengal. The ms. in the India Office has a colophon 
in which Aniruddha is styled Dharmadhikarariika ( Judge ). From 
the D&nasagara of Ballalasena we learn ( verses 6 and 7 ) that 
Aniruddha was a guru of that king of Bengal and rendered assistance 
in the composition of that work. The Dinasagara? 8 * was composed 
in iake 1091 ( i. e. 1169 A. D. ). From this it appears that 
Aniruddha was at the height of his fame in n 68, i. e. his literary 
activity may be placed in the third quarter of the 12th century A. D. 
This conclusion is corroborated by the fact that the Haralata names 
Bhojadeva, Govindaraja, and the Kamadhenu as authorities and is 
therefore later than 1100 A. D, The Haralata is named as an autho- 
rity in the Suddhiviveka of Rudradhara?* . The Sraddhakriya- 
kaumudi of Govindananda (about 15 10-1545 A. D. ) frequently 
quotes Aniruddha and includes him among ancient authors.?' 1 
The Pitrdayita is named in the Sraddhakriyakaumudi ( p. 503 ). 
In the Ahnikatattva (vol.1, p. 421) and Suddhitattva (vol.11, p. 314) 
of Raghunandana the views of Pitrdayita are quoted. There is a 
commentary on the Haralata called Sandarbhasucika composed by 
Acyuta Cakravartin, son of Haridasa Tarkacarya ( vide I. O. cat. 
p. 567, No. 1753).

In the proceedings of the ASB ( for 1869 p. 137 ) a Caturmasya- 
paddhati of Aniruddha is noted. Mitra notices a work called Bhaga- 
vattattvamaiijarl on Vaisnava philosophy written by Aniruddha 
( Mitra's Notices vol. III. p. 135, No. 2700 ). 

83. Ballalasena 

This famous king of Bengal compiled at least four works. His 
Acarasagara is mentioned in the Smrtiratnakara of Vedacarya and in 
the Madanaparijata ( p. 58 ). He also wrote the Pratisthasagara. 
Both these works are referred to as already composed in the Dana- 
sagara.?* 2 The Danasagara deals with the sixteen great danas and 
other lesser gifts. The subjects dealt with by the Danasagara are as 
follows : eulogy of brahmanas, eulogy of the merit arising from 
gifts, proper objects of gifts, exceptions, the nature of gift, the 
donor, faith as to the utility of gifts, proper times and places for 
gifts, things proper to be donated, what cannot be gifted away, bad 
donations, religious rites and procedure followed in making gifts and 
in accepting them, the technical terms of the subject of gifts, the 
sixteen mah&d&nas, lesser danas of various kinds ( the author him- 
self says at the end that he has described 1375 kinds of gifts ), the 
names of various puranas and their extent. The Danasagara con- 
tains extremely valuable information about the Mahabharata and the 
puranas. As it quotes extensively from the puranas, it serves as an 
excellent check for the textual restoration of puranas. For example 
it says that the Bhagavata, Brahmanda and Naradiya puranas do 
not contain danavidhis and hence they are not drawn upon in the 
work. In another verse he says that it is well-known that the 
Visnurahasya and Sivarahasya are of the nature of mere compilations 
and so have not been relied on in the work. The Devipuraria, he 
says, is approved of by the heterodox systems and is not included 
in various lists of puranas and upapuranas and hence it is not 
included in the Danasagara. He says that the subject of the dedi- 
cation of reservoirs of water and of temples has been dealt with 
at length in ihe PratisthasSgara, so it is omitted in the Danasagara 
and that the gifts made in accordance with the divisions of the year 
( into ayana, season, month, paksa &c. ) are not spoken of 
in their entirety in the Danasagara, as they are described 
in the Acarasagara. The work is mentioned in the Danaratnakara 

792 Verse* 55 and 56 of his mfffjifl; ( If °- "**• M * N °* M**-*)-

of CandeSvara and in the Nirnayasindhu. His Adbhutasagara has 
been printed by Messrs. Prabhakari and Co. ( 1905 ). The autho- 
rities on which he relies therein are noted below. 793 The Adbhu- 
tasagara is mentioned in Todaranandasamhita-saukjiya and Nirnaya- 
sindhu. This was his last work which he left unfinished and which 
was completed by his son Laksmanasena. It deals with the rites 
and observances appropriate on certain celestial and terrestrial 
portents for removing the evil foreboded by them. 

Ballalasena began the work in 1090 lake and the Danasagara 
was composed in 1091 iake. Therefore Ballalasena's literary activity 
ttiust be placed in the third quarter of the 12th century ( vide 
notes 674, 676 above ). Vide also IHQ vol. V, p. 133 for the date 
of Ballalasena. 

It appears that Raghunandana believed that the Danasagara was 
really the work of Aniruddhabhatta though published in the name 
of Ballalasena. ? 94 In the Danasagara itself it is distinctly stated 
that Ballalasena composed it under the directions of his guru 
( Aniruddha ). 7 *s In the colophon he is styled maharajadhiraja and 
and nihsanka-sankara. 

84. Harihara 

From quotations in the Vivadaratnakara it appears that Harihara 
wrote on vyavahara. For example, the Vivadaratnakara first 
quotes (on p. 220 ) the definition of € samsarana * given by Bjrhaspati 
and then cites three verses of Katyayana defining a cattifpatha and a 
rajamarga and prescribing punishments for causing obstruction and

committing nuisance thereon. Then it notices that the verse 
€ yas-tatra ' cited by it from Katyayana is cited by Harihara as from 
Praj&pati when the topic immediately preceding is * samsarana ' .^ 6 
The Vivadaratnakara quotes a sfitra of Safikha-Likhita prescribing 
the punishment for sexual intercourse with a virgin against her 
will and Harihara's explanation of the word ' dvyaftgulaccheda '. w 
From these it is clear that Harihara wrote some work on vyavahira, 
which has not yet been recovered. He must have flourished earlier 
than 1300 A. D. 

There is a commentary on the Paraskargjrhyasutra composed by 
Harihara who is styled agnihotrin in the colophons. In one ms. 
copied in Sake 1707 ( 1785-86 A. D. ) he is described as the pupil 
of VijiianeSvara. In the introductory second verse he says he relies 
on Vasudeva. In the body of the; work he refers ( Gujarati Press 
edition ) to Karkopadhyaya ( p. 200 ), Kalpatarukara, Renudiksita, 
and Vijnanesvaracarya ( p. 370 ). Therefore he is later than 11 50 
A. D. Harihara's views are mentioned by Hemadri,798 t he Samaya- 
pradipa and Acaradarsa of Sridatta and in the Smrtisara of Hari- 
natha. Therefore this Harihara must be earlier than 1250 A. D. 
Whether he was really the pupil of Vijfianeivara is doubtful. In 
his bhasya Harihara refers to words current in Kanoj. 800 Hemadri 
mentions Harihara's explanation of nepalakambala wherein the latter 
says that it is well known among the northerners. 801 Harihara -

paddhati is mentioned in the Sraddhatattva ( vol. I, p. 281 ) and 
Harihara in the YajurvediSraddhatattva ( vol. II, p. 488 ). We have 
seen- above that a Harihara commented upon the Asaucadasaka of 
VijiianeSvara. This fact together with his being not far from 
VijnaneSvara's time may have led to the belief that he was a pupil 
of Vijnanesvara. It appears probable that the jurist Harihara who 
flourished before 1300 and Harihara the bhasyakara of Paraskara 
who flourished between 1150 and 1250 A. D. are identical. The 
views ascribed to Harihara by Hemadri in his section on sraddha 
are not found in the bhasya on Paraskara. Therefore Hemadri 
is referring to some other work of Harihara. From a passage of 
Hemadri it appears that Harihara wrote after the Maharnava 802 
( Prakasa ). Hemadri also tells us that Harihara refuted the views 
of Jayantasvami on a certain verse. 8o * The same Harihara who 
commented on Paraskara also wrote a commentary on Katyayana's 
Snanavidhisutra wherein he mentions the Kalpatarukara ( vide 
D. C. ms. No. 101 of 1891-95). Several Hariharas are known. 
There is Hariharabhattacarya, the father of the great Bengal writer 
Raghunandana. A Hariharacarya composed an astrological work 
Samayapradipa in lake 1481 ( 15 59-1 560 A. D. ). 

85. The Smrticandrika of Devannabhatta 

This is a well-known digest on Dharmasastra. An English trans- 
lation of the portion of it which is concerned with dayabhdga was 
published in 1867 by T. Kristnasvami Iyer at Madras. The text 
has been published by Mr. J. R. Gharpure ( up to sraddha ) in 
Bombay and also in the Mysore Government Oriental series ( up 
to asauca ). In the following Mr. Gharpure's edition has been 
used and the Mysore edition for asauca section. The Smrticandrika 
is a very extensive digest. It is almost the earliest ( except the 
Kalpataru ) among digests on dharma&stra of which mss. have yet 
been discovered. The printed text deals with the topics ( kai^as ) 
of Saihskara, Ahnika > Vyavah&ra, Sraddha, Alauca. It appears that

he wrote on prayascitta also. In the colophons of mss. of the work 
the name of the author is variously written as Devanpa, Devaria, 
Devananda or Devagana ( vide I. O. cat. pp. 405-406 ). He is 
also described therein as the son of Ke&vadityabhafta and as a 
Somayaji. 

The Smrticandrika quotes most profusely from numerous smpi- 
karas and affords valuable assistance in reconstructing some of the 
smrtis and checking mss. and editions thereof. For example, it 
quotes about 600 verses from Katyayana on vyavahara and about 
the same number from Brhaspati. Among works, commentators 
and authors of digests named by it the following may be noted : 
AparSrkap, Trikandi, Devarata, Devasyami, Apastambakalpabhasyar- 
thakara ( A&mca p. 84 ), Dhareivara, Dharmabhasya, DhQrtasvami, 
Pradipa, Bhavanatha, Bhasya on Apastamba Dharmastitra, Dharma- 
dipa or Pradipa ( ASauca p. 63 ), Bhasyarthasamgrahakara, Manu- 
vrtti, Medhatithi, Mitaksara, Vaijayanti ( a lexicon ), Visvarupa, 
Viivadarsa ( Asauca p. 164), Sambhu, Srikara, Sivasvami, Smrti- 
bhaskara, Smrtyarthasara, He mentions a Bhatfacarya on Asauca 
(p. 1,2), probably Srinivasa, the author of Suddhidipika who 
wrote about 1159-60 A. D. (JASB 19 15 p. 334 ). He quotes a 
passage from the work of an author, whom he styles Guru ( proba- 
Iy his own teacher or father ). 8 ° 4 The Smrticandrika often criti- 
sizes these works and authors and advances its own views after 
considering the positions of others. Devangabhatfa was a southern 
writer and his work is according to judicial decisions of great 
authority in southern India. 80 * But it has been held, that in spite 
of its high authority it cannot override the Mitak§ara even in the 
Madras Presidency. 806 

The contents of the Smrticandrika are : various Dharmas, such 
as those of var#as> airamas; usages of countries; samskaras, garbha- 

( an^n p. 63 ).

'deposit, partnership, dayabhdga ; detailed rules about sraddha, its 
various kinds, persons entitled to perform sraddhas, the brahmanas 
proper to be invited at Sraddha etc. 

The Smrticandrika refers to Vijnanesvara with great respect. 807 
Yet there are several interesting points on which the Smrticandrika 
differs from the Mitaksara. , The Smrticandrika questkjps ( vide 
note 638 above ) the statement of the Mit. that unequal distribu- 
tion by the father of ancestral property among his sons should not 
be resorted to, as it has come to be abhorred by the^ people.. The 
Smrticandrika does not approve of the definition of daya given by 
the Mit. 8 ° 8 The Smrticandrika does not accept Vijnanesvara's 
explanation of the word c apratisthita ' occurring in the sutra of 
Gautama, but upholds Apararka's explanation of it ( vide note 771 
above ). The Smrticandrika favours the theory of spiritual benefit 
in matters of succession and therefore among daughters prefers one 
that has sons over another daughter who is . sonless. 80 ? It criticizes 
the reasons advanced by the Mit. for preferring the mother over 
the father as an heir to their deceased son and says that both parents 
succeed together. 810 Though the Smrticandrika in this way in some 

SSRfa* ( 3TnfN P- 64 ). This Is a quotation from fa^tf on q^

cases criticizes the Mit., it generally follows its lead. It holds, just 
as the Mit. does, that sons acquire by birth ownership in ancestral 
property. The author asserts that he puts forward no imaginary 
views but only such views as are based on ( authoritative ) texts. 8 " 

As the Smrticandrika names the Mit., Apararka and Smftyar- 
thasara, its upper limit cannot be placed earlier than 1150A. D # 
Their Lordships of the Privy Council say in Buddhasingh vs Laltu~ 
singh* 12 that Devanandabhatta is supposed to have been a contem- 
porary of Apararka. But this supposition is not quite correct. 
Since Apararka is quoted several times as an authority to be pre- 
ferred even to the Mit., it looks more probable that there is some 
distance «jf time between Apararka and Devanflabhatfa. Hemadri 
quotes the views of the Smrticandrika probably oftener than those 
of any other nibandhakdra. In one place 81 * he does not approve 
of the explanation given by the Smrticandrika of a verse occurring 
in the Mahabharata about a man with male issue performing 
sraddha on the thirteenth tithi. In another 81 * place Hemadri refers to 
the view of the Smrticandrika on the question whether the Ir&ddha on 
amdvdsyd is optional with sraddha in dark half. Therefore it 
follows that the Smrticandrika must have been composed at least a 
generation earlier than Hemadri, i. e. before 1225 A. D. The 
Smyticandrika is frequently quoted by the Sarasvativilasa, the 
Viramitrodaya and other digests.

Several authors composed works styled Siurticandrika, e. g. there 
is a Smrticandrika of Sukadeva-miSra ( I. O- cat. p. 471 No. 1549 ), 
another by Apadeva ( Mitra's Notices, vol. VI, p. 301 ), another by 
Vamadevabhattacarya ( Mitra's Notices, vol. IX, p. 137 ). 

86. Haradatta 

Haradatta's fame stands very high as a commentator. He wrote 
a commentary called Anakula on the Apastamba-grhya-sutra 
( D. C. Ms. No. a of 1866-68 ), a commentary on the Apastambiya- 
mantra-patha ( vide Dr. Winternitz's ed. of 1897, p. XIII ), a com- 
mentary called Anavila on the ASvalayana-grhya-sutra ( published 
in the Trivandrum series ), a commentary called Mitaksara on the 
Gautamadharmasutra and a commentary named Ujjvala on the 
dharmasutra of Apastamba. His commentaries are very good 
models of ideal commentaries. His commentary on the dharma- 
sutra of Gautama ( printed by the Anandasrama Press, Pooona ) is 
more concise than that on the Dharmasutra of Apastamba ( large 
extracts of which were published by Bllhler in his edition in the 
B. S. series, the whole being printed by Halasyanath Sastri at 
Kumbhakonam and in the Mysore Government Oriental Library 
series ). In his commentary on the Dharmasutras he quotes verses 
from numerous smrtis and from the puranas but hardly ever 
mentions by name any commentator or nibandhahara. In his 
Anavila ( page 9 ) he quotes the views of a Bhasyakara who is 
probably Devasvamin and mentions also a Candogagrhyabhasya- 
kara ( on I. 2. 3 ). In his commentaries on both the Dharmasutras 
he frequently quotes the opinions of previous commentators with 
the words c anye, ' ' aparah, * ' kecit ; ' vide G. Dh. S. II. 28, VII. 4 
and 14, IX. 52, XI. 17, XII. 32 and 33., XXIV. 5, XXVI. 9,

I0 - 4> I- 3. 11. 20, 1. 5. 15. 20. etc. From the fact that he mentions 
two interpretations on Ap, Dh. S. I. a. 5- a. with the words 
* aparaaha* and c ityanye ' and several interpretations on II. 7, 17. 
22 it follows that he had before him two or three commentaries on 
A P. Dh. S. In Buhler's edition Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. a. 38 
appears to refer to a grhya-vrtti, but in the Kumbhakonam edition 
&e reading is different ( viz. gfbye gatam ). He is very careful to 



348 History of Dhanmillstra 

point out the un-Paninean forms in the sfltras of Gautama* 1 * and 
Apastamba, explains at great length all grammatical matters and 
generally prefers readings that are in consonance with the rules of 
Panini. He very often says that the text of the sQtras, particularly 
of Apastamba, as handed down by oral tradition was either wrong 
or followed Vedic usage as regards grammar. 816 

From various references Haradatta seems to have been an in- 
habitant of Southern India or was at least very familiar with its 
usages. On Gautama XI. 20 he instances several usages of the 
Colas. On Gautama XV. 18 he gives a synonym in the Dravida 
language for 81 ? a skin disease called c Kilasa. * On Ap. Gr. S. VI. 6 
( the surra ' nadlnirdesasca etc. ) he gives Kaveri and Vegavati as 
instances. On Ap. Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 15 (last sutra ) he refers to 
certain practices of the Dravidas observed when the Sun is in 
Aries or Virgo. 818 The Viramitrodaya classes Haradatta and the 
Smrticandrikakara among southern nibandhakaras* 1 * From his 
remark on Ap. Dh. S- II. 7. 17. 25 (the sutra 'anyatra rahudar- 
sanat ) ' that the northerners do not recite that sutra it appears that 
he affirms that he was a southerner. 

Haradatta seems to have been a great devotee of Siva. He 
begins his commentary on Gautama, on ASvalayana-grhya and Ap. 
Gr. with an obeisance to Rudra and his commentaries on Ap, Dh. S. 
and on the Apastambiya-mantra-pafha (otherwise called Ekagni-

kaoda, 2 S t ' 1 an< l 2 *>th P^ainas of Apastamba-kalpa ) with an obei- 
sance to Mahadeva. Burnell ( Tanjore mss. cat. p. 170 ) tells us 
that according to tradition in Southern India, Rudradatta, the com- 
mentator of the Ap. Srauta-sutra, is the same as Haradatta. In his 
commentary on Ap. Gr. S- 1- 13. S ( ghosavad caturaksaram va) 
he gives as instances of the names of males Hara, Rudra, Deva, 
Haradatta and Bhavanaga. In the colophons the Anivila is describ- 
ed as the work of Haradattacarya-misra. 

Ghose in his Hindu Law (3rd ed. Intro, p. XV ) says that, like 
Medhatithi, Haradatta denies the heritable rights of widows and 
must have come before Vijnanesvara and not after. But Ghose 
appears to be wrong. Haradatta first says that according to the 
ficarya( i. e. Apastamba ) the sapindas of the deceased who took the 
property were obliged to maintain the widow of the deceased, 
while the view of Gautama was that the widow took, on failure of 
male issue, an equal share along with the sapindas, and then 
Haradatta says that he himself liked the latter view. 8 * He often 
gives interesting information. On Gautama XVII. 33 he tells us 
that asafoetida is eaten by all, even though it is a matter for consi- 
deration whether being the exudation of a tree, it is to be regarded 
as due to cutting (and so forbidden ). 8ax On Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 5. 
14 he cites as an example of reviling ( a-kroia ) the following : * the 
Taittiriya is a Sakha that is ucchi^a ( the leavings of food eaten ), 
the Yajnavalkya and other Brahmana works are modern \ 8aa On 
Gautama IV. 5. he says that what distinguishes the Prajapatya form 
of marriage from the Brahma and others is that there is in the 
former a stipulation that the husband is not to enter into another 
order of life ( airama ) nor is he to marry another woman. 8 ** On 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 12. 15 he says that whereas in the case of marriage 
with a paternal aunt's or maternal uncle's daughter, the act springs

from the fact that one is pleased thereby, there is no necessity to 
infer a sastra ( a Vedic passage ) once existing but now lost ( in 
support of such usage ). 8 * 4 

The date of Haradatta is a rather difficult problem. Btthler 
( S. B. E. vol. II. p. xliii ) at first thought that Haradatta probably 
wrote in the 16th century, but in his 2nd edition of the Ap. Dh. S. 
he says ( p. vm ) that the Munich ms of the Ujjvala written in 
Poona about 1600 A. D. shows the interpolated text found in all 
Devan&gari copies and that therefore Haradatta is older than at. 
least 14 50-1 500 A. D. The Viramitrodaya 82 * frequently cites the 
Mitak?ara of Haradatta on Gautama. Narayanabhajta ( born in 
15 13 A. D. ) in his Prayoga-ratna quotes Haradatta's comment on 
Gautama VIII. 14-22 about samskaras and his son Saftkarabhatfa 
names both the Mkak§ara and the Ujjvala of Haradatta in his 
Dvaitanirnaya. The Prayogaparijata of Nrsimha, which is quoted 
in the Prayogaratha of Narayanabhafta and is therefore not later 
than the first quarter of the 1 6th century, cites Haradatta's expla- 
nation of Ap. Gr. S. ( on c pravasad-etya putrasya sirah parigrhya 
japati ' etc. ) and contrasts it with Narayana's view. The Subo- 
dhini of Visvesvarabhatfa ( about 1375 A. D. ) on Mit. ( Yaj II. 
132 ) quotes certain smjti passages as found in the vrtti of Apas- 
tamba which are found in Haradatta's gloss. 8 * 6 Hence it follows 
that Haradatta cannot be later than about 1300 A. D. The fact 
that Haradatta hardly ever names any commentator except perhaps 
Devasvamin, the Bhasyakara of Apastambe-grhya, and that he holds 
antiquated views about the widow's right to succeed to her deceased 
husband's estate are strong arguments in favour of the view that 
Haradatta is comparatively an early writer. Hardly any writer 
after Vijnanesvara assigns the same position to the widow as Hara-

datta does. Hence it appears that Haradatta could not have 
flourished much later than noo A. D. So he must be placed 
between 1 100-1300 A. D., very probably near the earlier limit 
than the later one. 

One important question is as to the identity of Haradatta, the 
commentator of the Dharma and Grhya sutras and Haradatta, the 
author of the Padamanjari, a commentary on the Kasika of Vamana 
and Jayaditya. Btihler felt uncertain about the identity. Safikara- 
bhatta in his Dvaita-nirnaya speaks of" Haradatta as expounding 8 * 7 
a hdrika of Hari ( Vakyapadiya III. p. 260, Benares ed. ) and also 
speaks of Haradatta as the author of the Ujjvala and the Mitak§ara 
without making any distinction between the two. This shows 
that he regarded the two as identical, Haradatta in his commen- 
taries on the Dharmasutras gives far more attention to grammar 
than almost any other commentator of Dharmasastra. 8 * 8 His 
grammatical disquisition on Ap. Dh. S. 1.2. 5. 18 ('plavanamca 
namno ' etc. ) is almost identical with the Padamanjari on Panini 
VIII. 2. 83 ( ' pratyabhivadesQdre *). On Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17. 17 
he quotes a verse as from the grammarians for defining the location 
of the udicyas*** T!k Madhaviya Dhatu-vrtti mentions the Pada- 
manjari. From this it follows that the Padamanjari was composed 
before 1500 A. D. Dr. Belvalkar places Haradatta, the author of the 
Padamanjari, about 1100 A. D. 8 * The learned editor of the 
Anavila in the Trivandrum series points out that, as Haradatta is

quoted ih the Puru§akara which in its turn is mentioned in the 
Dhfttu-vrtti of Midhava and as &araijadeva, the author of the 
Dutghata-vjsti, who wrote in Sake 1095, c * tes the Jainendra and 
Kaiyafa but not Haradatta nor the Padamanjari, Haradatta wrote 
about the close of the 12th century A. D. These circumstances 
render it highly probable ( if not certain ) that Haradatta the com- 
mentator of the Dharmasutras is the same as the author of the Pada- 
manjari and that he flourished between 1100 and 1300 A. D. and 
probably about 1200 A. D. The Smrticandrika twice refers to the 
bha§ya of the Apastamba-dharma-sutra. 8 * 1 Haradatta's commentary 
is styled vftti and not bhasya and the citations do not occur in his 
work. Hence it appears that the Smpicandrika did not know 
Haradatta's works and the latter could not have flourished much 
earlier than the Smrti-candrika. 

In the Padamanjari Haradatta is said to have been the son of 
Padma ( Rudra )-kumara, younger brother of Agnikumara and a 
pupil of Aparajita. 8 * 2 In his Padamanjari Haradatta employs the 
word € kucimanci , which is a Telugu word. 8 " The Bhavisyottara- 
purana printed in Grantha characters contains 12 chapters ( 5410 
65th ) and the Sivarahasya printed in the said characters has one 
chapter ( 17th ) which set out the life (carita) of a Haradatta- 
carya. It is there stated that Haradattacarya's original name was 
Sudarsana, that he was the son of Vasudeva and that he died 3979 
years after Kaiiyuga began 8 " ( i. e. 878 A. D. ). This Haradatta- 
carya, being the son of Vasudeva, was not the same as the author

of the Padamanjari, who was the son of Padmakumara. This 
earlier Haradatta may probably be the same as the Haradattacarya 
cited as an authority in the Sarvadarsana-samgraha on the Nakulisa- 
pasupatadarsana. 8 " Dr. Jolly ( R. u. S. p. 33 ) identifies without 
sufficient foundation the Haradattztcarya of the Sarvadarsana-sam- 
graha with Haradatta, the commentator of Apastamba and Gautama. 

A work called Hari-hara-taratamya and another called Caturveda- 
tatparya-samgraha are ascribed to a Haradatta. Of the latter there 
is a ms. in the Deccan College collection (No. 109 of 1871-72 ), 
which contains 154 verses of fine penmanship. The first and last 
are given below. 836 Whether these two works were composed by 
Haradatta, the commentator of the Dharmasatras, it is difficult to say. 
In the latter wo^k the author sings a hymn of praise to Siva as the 
supreme deity, points out how the Vedic mantras refer to him, how 
the various rites are meant for him, refers to the mythological re- 
presentations of Siva as Kirata, or as wearing skin etc. All the 
verses upto 143 are in the Vasantatilaka metre, while towards the 
end there are a few verses in other metres such as Sikharini and 
Rathoddhata. He was a staunch Saivite, 8 *? though the hymn 
breathes a spirit of tolerance and sympathy for different religious and 
philosophical systems. He refers to the Maitrayapa Sruti, Talava- 
kara firahmana, Katyayana-grhya, Bhagvadgita, the Puranas as 
supplementing the Vedas ( vedopabfihhaka ), the Simkhya and 
Yoga.

87. Hemadri 

Hemadri and Madhava are the Castor and Pollux in the galaxy 
oidakfiyatya writers on Dharma&stra. Hemadri is a very volumi- 
nous writer. He is the author of the Caturvarga-cintama^i, an 
encyclopaedia of ancient religious rites and observances. According 
to the statements contained in the work itself the author intended 
to treat Dharmasastra in five sections, called vrata, dana, tirtha, 
moksa and parisesa. 8 * 8 The Parisesa-khanda was divided into four 
parts, viz,, Devata, Kalanirnaya, Karmavipaka, Laksanasamuccaya. 8 ** 
The Caturvarga-cintamani has been published in the Bibliotheca 
Indica series. Four volumes containing 6 parts and covering about 
6000 pages have been so far printed. The second and third 
volumes have two parts each. The fourth volume which deals 
with prdyaicitta does not appear to be the work of Hemadri. 8 * 
The work so far published is concerned with vrata , dana, iraddha 
and kdla ( the latter two being parts of the parisesa-khanda ). That 
portion of the Caturvarga-cintamani which was intended to treat of 
tirtha and mokfa has not yet come to light. It is extremely doubt- 
ful whether the author was able to carry out his gigantic scheme. 
Mss. of portions of the great work are described in the catalogues 
under various names, e. g. I. O. cat. No. 1379, p. 407 on i&ntika- 
pautfikani is the same subject that is treated in vratakhayda pp. 
I003ff., though there are considerable variations between the Ms. 
and the printed text. 

Hemadri's is a standard work on the subjects with which be 
deals. He quotes most profusely fromsmjtis and puripas and 
names a host of writers. He appears to have been a profound 
student of the Purvamimamsa. The discussions in his work, parti- 
cularly on sraddha and kala, cannot be well understood without 
thorough acquaintance with the numerous nydyas of the mimamsa

which he employs at every step. To illustrate this a few instances 
may be cited at random. On pp. 137,143,156, 159, of his kala- 
nirnaya ( vol. Ill part 2 ) he makes use of four different nyayas of 
the tnimatHsa. 8 * 1 The eminent commentators and nibandhakdras on 
dharma&stra and other works named by him are given below. 8 * 2 
It is somewhat remarkable that though he quotes Apararka and the 
Smrti-candrika scores of times he hardly ever mentions by name 
the Mitik§ara of Vijiianesvara. Though he does not promise a 
treatment of vyavahara, here and there he makes sallies into the 
domain of vyavahara. For example, he quotes the well-known 
sQtra of Gautama ( 10. 39 ) on the sources of ownership and holds 
a lengthy discussion thereon. 8 ** In another place he digresses 
into the question of the various kinds ofstridhana and their devolu- 
tion ( vol. Ill, part 1, pp. 530-531 ). He was of opinion that every- 
one, to whatever iakha he may belong, should perform sraddha in 
accordance with the directions thereon in all Sakhas, kalpa and grhya 
sfltras, smrtis, puranas and usages. 8 ** He makes the important

Hemadri gives some account of himself in his work. The Mss. 
present great variations from the printed text. He belonged to the 
Vatsagotra. 8 * 6 He was the grandson of Vasudeva and the son of 
Kamadeva. The introductions to the khandas contains fulsome 
praise of Hemadri. One verse says that Hemadri scored out by 
showering wealth on poor people the lines that Brahma had drawn 
on their forehead at the time of their birth ( foredooming them to 
eternal poverty ) and that Brahma acquiesces in such conduct of 
Hemadri. *v Another verse says that none existed, exists or will 
exist surpassing Hemadri. 848 He describes himself as in charge of 
the imperial records of Mahadeva, the Yadava king of Devagiri 
( modern Daulatabad ). 849 In the colophon^ and the body of the 
work also he is described as the karayadhiivara of Mahadeva, as 
highly honoured by the king and as a minister ( mantrin ) of the 
king. 850 He gives in the introduction to the Vratakhapda a detailed 
pedigree of the Yadavas of Devagiri. In the section on kala 
(vol. Ill, part 2) he starts with Saiighana ( i. e. Siiighana

of the inscriptions ), then speaks of his son Jaitrapala ( i. e. 
Jaitugi ), his son Krsna ( or Kanhara ) and lastly of Maha- 
deva, son of the younger brother of Krsna. This is not the 
place to go into the genealogy of the Yadavas. There are some 
discrepancies between the genealogy as presented by Hemadri and 
as gathered from the inscriptions and numerous copperplate grants 
of the Yadavas. Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. I, part 2, pp. 248-249 
for Hemadri and pp. 268-275 for extracts from the Vratakharida, 
pp. 252 and 519 for two pedigrees of the Devagiri Yadavas and 
pp. 511-534 for history. The following may be consulted for the 
principal grants of the Yadavas :— Ind. Ant. vol. 17, p. 117 ( Kalas- 
budruk plate of Bhillama dated iake 948 or 1025 A. D. ), E. I. vol.

Kanhara dated 1249-50 A. D. ), Ind. Ant. vol. 14, p. 314 (Paithan 
plate of Ramacandra dated iake 1193 ), E. I. vol. XIII, p. 198 
(Thana plate of Ramacandra dated iake 1194L e. 1272 A. D. ), 
E. I. vol. XIX, p. 20 ( Mamdapur inscription of Kanhara dated 
iake 1 172 i. e. 1250 A. D. wherein his younger brother Mahadeva 
is described asyuvard/a). Mahadeva reigned from 1260 to 127 1 and 
Ramacandra, the son of Krsna, from 1271 to 1309 A, D. Since in the 
Caturvarga-cintamani Hemadri is said to be the keeper of the state 
records of Mahadeva, that work must have been composed at some time 
between 1260 and 1270 A. D. There are contemporary records 
available showing that Hemadri was in high favour not only with 
Mahadeva but also with his successor Ramacandra. The Thana plate 
of Ramacandra ( dated iake n 94, i. e. 1272 A. D. ) records the 
the grant of a village called Vaul in Sasati (modern Sastf in the 
Thana District ) to thirty-two brahmanas by Acyuta Nayaka of the 
Gautama gotra and descendant of Jalhana, who was the governor of 
Konkan, and describes 8 * 1 Hemadri as one who had attained a pre- 
eminent position in the government through the favour of Rama- 
candra and as one who was in charge of all ( state ) records and was 
^h e foremost minister.

. Hemadri is credited with a commentary on &aunaka's Praijava- 
kalpa. 8 * 2 He appears to have written a fraddha-kalpa according to 
the rules of Katyayana which is distinct from his Sraddhakhaptfa 
(vide Calcutta Sanskrit College mss. cat,, vol. II, p. 163, No. 217 
and Stein's cat. p. 103 ). Hemadri also wrote a commentary 8 " 
called Kaivalyadipika on the Muktaphala of Vopadeva, the famous 
author of the Mugdhabodha grammar. The Muktaphala embodies 
the philosophy of the Bhagavata purana in 19 adhyayas and 784 
verses (and a few lines in prose in 5th and 6th chapters). Vopadeva 
was a friend and protegee of Hemadri, who wrote several works at 
the encouragement of the latter. He says that he wrote the Hari- 
liia ( published in the Calcutta Oriental Series No. 3 ), an index 
of the Bhagavata for pleasing the minister Hemadri. 81 * There is a 
commentary on this work called Viveka with which both Hemadri 
and Madhusudana-Sarasvati had something to do. 8 ** Hemadri 
also wrote a commentary called Ayurvedarasayajia on the 
Asjaflgahrdaya of Vagbhata.

Altogether Hemadri was a towering personality. His name is 
associated throughout the Maratha Country with the construction 
of numerous temples having a peculiar style of architecture. He is 
also credited with having invented the Modi script. Within a few 
decades his Caturvarga-cintamani, particularly its dana and vrata 
sections, came to be looked upon as the standard work in the whole 
of the Deccan and southern India. Madhava in his Kalanirpaya 
(p. 67) expressly mentions the Vratakhanda of Hemadri as an 
authority. This work was composed about 1340 A. D. In an 
inscription of Bhaskara alias Bhavadura, son of Bukka I, dated iake 
1291 (i. e. 1369 A. D. ) the king is described as making various 
gifts following the composition of Hemadri. 8 * 6 This is obviously 
a reference to his danakhayda and establishes that long before 1369 
A. D. Hemadri had become a standard author in the Telugu 
country. The Vanapalli plate of Anna-Vema dated iake 1300 
(about 1380 A. D.) describes Vema as giving the various gifts in 
Hemadri and his son as one who observed the vratas and danas*n 
described by Hemadri. Pedda-Komati-Vema is described in a 
grant of sake 1344 as eager in bestowing gifts described in the rules 
of Hemadri. 8 ** Hemadri is quoted in the Madanaparijata, 85 * the 
Dvaitanirnaya of &ankarabhatta, the Nirnayasindhu and other 
works. 

88. Kullukabhatta

Kulluka's commentary on the Manusmpi styled the 
Manvarthamuktavali is the most famous of all commentaries on 
Manu. It has been printed several times. In the following the 
Nirnayasagara edition of 1909 has been relied upon. Kulluka's 
commentary is concise and lucid and his remarks are always to the 
point. He avoids all unnecessary discussions and is never prolix. 
He was not however original. He drew upon the commentaries of 
Medhatithi and Govindaraja and incorporated a great deal from them

into his own work without acknowledgment. For example, on 
Manu XL 95 he simply summarises the remarks 860 of Govindaraja 
and cites only one out of the several quotations that are found in 
Govindaraja's Manu-tfka. He severely criticizes both Medhatithi 
and Govindaraja, particularly the latter. He frequently pours 
ridicule on the latter (vide note 713 above ). At the end of his 
commentary he says 861 that Medhatithi's skill lay in expounding 
what texts were authoritative and of substance and what were not so, 
Govindaraja in concise words explained the hidden meaning of the 
brief text (of Manu), while Dhararudhara had his own method of 
explanation which was independent of previous tradition ; and there- 
fore he undertook to write a commentary that would clearly set forth 
the real meaning of Manu. He was very proud of his achievement 
and says that neither Medhatithi nor Govindaraja nor other 
commentators explained in the way he did and that explanatory 
material like his would be difficult to find elsewhere. 86 * He notices 
the explanations of Medhatithi and Govindaraja hundreds of times, 
discusses various readings and his commentary deserves to a consider- 
able extent the eulog} pronounced by Sir William Jones 86 * " At

study and the collation of numerous manuscripts, produced a work 
of which it may perhaps be said very truly that it is the shortest 
yet the most luminous, the least ostentatious yet the most learned, 
the deepest yet the most agreeable, commentary ever composed on 
any author, ancient or modern. " 

Among the authors and works quoted by him ( besides the 
usual smitis ) are the following : — Garga ( on II. 6 ), Govindaraja, 
Dharanidhara, Bhaskara ( bhasyakara of the Vedantasutras, on I. 8 
and 15 ), Bhojadeva ( on VIII. 184 ), Medhatithi, Vamana ( author 
of the Ka&ka ), Bhauavartika-krt ( on XII. 106 ), Visvartipa ( the 
commentator of Yajnavalkya, on II. 189 and V. 68 ). The Visva- 
rupa that he quotes on Manu V. 215 is the lexicographer and not 
the jurist as Aufrecht ( in his great catalogue ) appears to hold. 

He gives us a little information about himself in the introduc- 
tory verse. 864 He came of a Varendra Brahmaga family of Bengal 
( Gauda ) residing in Nandana and was the son of Bhatta Divakara. 
He wrote his commentary in Kasi in the company of Pandits. On 
Manu VI. 14 he mentions the names of certain vegetables that were 
current in Malwa and among the Vahikas. 86 * 

It appears that Kulluka also composed a digest called Smrti- 
sagara. A Ms. of a portion of it called Sraddhasagara exists in the 
Calcutta Sanskrit College ( cat. vol. II. p. 405, No. 446 ). In this 
his Asaucasagara and Vivadasagara are referred to. 

I secured a transcript of the ms. of the Sraddhasagara in the 
Calcutta Sanskrit College through the kindness of the Principal. 
The Sraddhasagara deals with the following subjects : — definition of 
of sradha ; whether it is of the nature of yAga, dana and homa ; 
various kinds of sraddhas such as nitya, naimittika &c. ; the proper 
and improper places for sraddha ; the proper times for sraddha ; 
Asfaka-Sraddha ; Madras can perform asfaka aud other sraddhas ; inter- 
calary month ; who are paAkti-pavana brahmanas ; meaning of

nimantrana and amantraija ; the number of brthmaijas to be 
invited ; the darbhas ; £raddhadevatas ; the sacred thread etc. 

The £raddhasagara is full of PGrvamimariisa discussions. The 
author says that he wrote it and the other two works ( Vivadasagara 
and A&ucasagara ) at the order of his father. He quotes profusely 
from the Mahabharata, the Mahapuranas and Upapuranas and from 
the dharmasutras and metrical smjtis. He names the Kalpataru 
oftener than any other nibandbakara. The other authors and works 
named are : Bhojadeva, Halayudha ( probably the author of . 
Prakasa on the Sraddhakalpasutra of Katyayana ), Jikana, Kama- 
dhenu, Medhatithi, SaGkhadhara. In one place we have a reference 
to Prabhakara and Kamalakarabhafta ( on Kala and Kama being 
devatas ) and in another place to Gauda-Maithila-MayGkhabhaftah 
( which are probably marginal notes creeping into the ms. or refer 
to authors other than the well-known ones ). He refers to the 
opinion of his own guru in opposition to that of the Kalpataru. 

The date of KullGka cannot be settled with certainty. Btthler 
held that he lived probably in the 15th century ( S. B. E. vol. 
xxv. p. cxxxi ). Ghose ( Hindu Law, 3rd edition p. XVI ) and 
M. M. Chakravarti ( JASB 191 5, p. 345 ) are of the same opinion. 
In I. L. R. 48 Cal. 643 Sir Asutosh Mukerji places KullGka in the 
15th century (at p. 688). As Kulluka mentions Bhojadeva, Govinda- 
r&ja, Kalpataru and Halayudha he is certainly later than 11 50 A. D. 
Raghunandana 8 " in his Dayatattva and Vyavaharatattva, and Vardha- 
mana in his Dandaviveka frequently mention his views. SrinathaV 
com. on the Dayabhaga refutes the view of KullGka. The Srtddha- 
kriya-kaumudi of Govindananda refers to Kulluka's explanation of 
the word € akaftksan ' as * Viksamapab ' in Manu III. 258. The 
Rajaniti-ratnakara of Capdesvara quotes the explanation of 
KullGka. 867 Therefore KullGka must have flourished before 1300

88. KuUUkabhatfa S69 

A. D. Kuilttka in his by no means small work nowhere refers to 
the Dayabhaga, though he himself came of a Bengal family. This 
silence is explicable in two ways. As we have seen, Kulluka wrote 
in Kasi and not in Bengal. Therefore if he flourished not long 
after Jimfitavahana, it is quite natural that writing in Benares he 
had not heard of the Dayabhaga or read it. It has been shown 
above that JimQtavahana probably wrote about 1100-1150 A. D. 
Therefore Kulinka flourished between 11 50 and 1300 A. D. and 
probably wrote about 1250 A. D. M. M. Chakravarti is not sure 
as to how early Kullttka flourished but opines that he could not 
have flourished later than the first quarter of the 15 th century

89. Sridatta Upadhyaya 

Mithila has made extremely valuable and substantial contribu- 
tions to Dharma&stra Literature. From the days of the Yajnavalkya 
smrti down to modern times the land of Mithila has produced 
writers whose names are illustrious. Sridatta Upadhyaya is one 
of the earliest afmong the mediaeval Maithila nibandhakdras. He is 
the author of several works which will be briefly noticed. 

The Acaradaria of Sridatta was printed in Benaras at the Divakara 
Press and by the VenkateSvara Press in Bombay in sathvat 1961. 
It is a manual of the daily religious duties of the followers of the 
white Yajurveda(Vajasaneyins), 868 such as Ocamana, brushing the 
teeth, morning bath, sathdhya, japa, brahrr.ayajna, tarpava, daily 
worship of gods, vaiivadeva, feeding guests etc. Among the works 
and writers named are the following 86 *: — Acara-cintamani, Kalpa- 
taru, Kamadhenu, Kalikapuraria, Gane&misra, Raja ( probably 
Bhojadeva), Smrtimaharpava, Harihara and Halayudha-nibandha. 
There is a commentary on this work called Acaradarsabodhini

composed by Gauripati or GauriSa, son of Damodara Maithila, at 
Benaras in 1640 A. D ( Dr. Bhandarkar's report, 1883-84, p. 347 )• 
In this work he uses several vernacular words ; e. g. he says that 
c §ala' tree is known as Sagavana 8 ? ( in the vernacular ). 

Another work of his is the Chandogahnika on the daily duties for 
Samavedins. He refers to it in his Samayapradipa 872 and Pitrbhakti. 
A supplement to it named Chandogahnikoddhara was written by 
Saftkaramisra, son of Bhavanathami&ra ( Mitra's Notices, vol. VI 
p. 10, No. 1989 )• 

The Pitrbhakti is a manual on the sraddha rites for students of 
the Yajurveda. It was based 87 * on the Katiyakalpa with Karka's 
bhasya thereon and on the works of Gopala and BhQpala ( i. e. 
Bhojadeva). It is frequently quoted in the Sraddhaviveka of 
Rudradhara. Among the writers named are ( besides those that 
occur in the Acaradarsa also ) : Pitrhitakaranikara, Narayanavrtti ( on 
Asvalayana Gr. S. ), Mitaksara, Ratnakarandika, Vidhipuspamala 
(26 a ), Subhakara, Smrtimanjari, Smjrtimanjasa, Halayudha's 
Sraddhadhyaya. This work first treats of the details; of the 
Pdrvayairaddha, then of ekoddisfa, of the monthly sraddhas, the 
fraddha on the nth day after death, of Sapiridikarana, of abhyudayika 
sraddha. It then proceeds to consider the definition of sraddha. 

The Sraddhakalpa was composed by him for the Samavedins. 
It is referred to in his Samayapradipa 87 ' and Pitrbhakti ( folio 33b ) 

The Samayapradipa treats of the proper times for various 
vratas. s ^ It is divided into three chapters ( paricchedas). The

first is called Samayapariccheda and dilates upon the definition of 
vrata, on the procedure about fasts, ndkta and the vratas of Gane£a 
and other deities, the second is called Samvatsara-kjtya-pariccheda 
and treats of vratas from the pratipada to the amdvasya in the 
several months and the third is called prakirnaka ( mis- 
cellaneous ) dealing with the vratas on safikr&nti ( the 
Sun's passage into another Zodiacal sign ) etc. In this work Sridatta 
often refers to the views of the Gaudas and contrasts them with his 
own. He also refers to Gaudanibandha. No other writers or 
works except those that are already enumerated under Ac£radarit 
and Pitrbhakti are named in this work. On folio 7a there is a 
name which is somewhat indistinct and appears to be 'Mitamitradi- 
bhih\ The Samayapradipa is mentioned in the Krtya-ratpakara 
( pp. 400, 479, 503 ) of Candesvara and in Salapani's Durgotsava- 
viveka.* 75 £ridatta is more frequently quoted in the Sraddhakriya- 
kaumud! of Govindananda than almost any other author or work. 

As Sridatta names the Kalpataru, Harihara and Halayudha's 
work on Sraddha he must have flourished later than 1200 A. D, 
As Candesvara mention his Samayapradipa, Sridatta must have 
flourished before the first quarter of the 14th century. If GaAesa- 
miSra mentioned in the Acaradarsa be the same as GanesvaramiSra, 
the author of Sugatisopana and uncle of Candesvara ( which 
appears extremely probable ), then Sridatta flourished a short time 
before Candesvara and must have composed his works between 
1275 and 1 3 10 A. D. 

It appears that there was another Maithila writer called Sridatta* 
misra, son of Nagesvaramiira, who composed the Ekagnidana- 
paddhati and one or two other works ( Hp. Nepal cat. p. 129). 
The Nepal Ms. of the Ekagnidana-paddhati was copied in La-Sam 
299 ( Lak§amapasena era 299, i. e. 1418 A. D. ). Vide Hp. 
Nepal cat. XII, 45 and 129. So this Sridatta flourished towards 
the end of the 14th century in the reign of Devasiiiiha son of 
Bhavesa. Vide JASB for 1915 pp. 379-381 and 388-390 for 
Sridatu.

go. Candesvara 



Catjde£vara is the most prominent figure among Maithila 
nibandhdkdras on Dharmasastra. He compiled an extensive digest 
called Smrtiratnakara or simply Ratnakara. This digest was divided 
into seven sections viz., on kjtya, dana, vyavahara, Suddhi, pQja,viv£da 
and gjrhastha. 8 ? 6 Out of these the Vivadaratnakara dealing with 
d&yabhaga and the other titles of law ( vyavah&rapadas ) has been 
printed in the B. I. series and has been translated into English 
by Mr. G. C. Sarkar and by Mr. Justice Digambara Chatterjee. 
The Vivadaratnakara of Candesvara and the Vivadacintamapi of 
Vacaspati are of paramount authority in matters of Hindu Law in 
Mithila ( modern Tirhut ) so far as British Indian Courts are 
concerned. 8 ?* 

The Krtya-ratnakara deals in 22 tarafigas with the discussion of 
Dharma ( its real nature, its rewards, means of knowing it and the 
occasions for it ), the various vratas and observances in the several 
months from Caitra, the observances in the intercalary month, various 
vratas on the several days of the week, the Sun's passage into a new 
sign, eclipse on the new-moon day etc. This work is referred to in 
his Danaratnakara, which in its turn is quoted in the Grhastha- 
ratnakara. 8 ? 8 The work has recently been printed in the B. I. 
series (192$). 

The Grhastharatnakara is a very extensive work in 68 tarafigas 
on the duties of householders. The Deccan College Ms. that T 
could consult is incomplete, has only folios 30, 72-133 and contains 
the last 23 tarafigas only. Some of the subjects dealt with are :—

actions proper for Ksatriyas, Vateyas and Sodras ; the observances 
of a sndtaka ; yama and niyama ; iauca ; the observances of brahtna- 
carya ; what ruins families ; proper abode for a grhastha ; what a 
grhastha should or should not speak or should or should not see ; 
things not to be given to tndras ; the avoidance of anger, adultery 
and intermixture of castes ( sathkara) ; requiting of debts etc. 

The D&naratnakara contains 29 tarangds and deals with the 
following subjects : — meaning of dana ; what may or may not be 
gifted ; fit objects of charity ; the gifts called mahdd&nas ; gifts of a 
thousand cows and heaps of corn ; various gifts, such as those of 
food, books ; gifts appropriate to certain months, nakfatras and tithis; 
miscellaneous gifts; dedication of wells and tanks for public 
use ; planting of trees. 

The Vivadaratnakara is an extensive work (671 pages in print ) 
in 100 tarangas on civil and criminal law and deals with the 18 
titles of law such as dayabhaga (on partition and inheritance), 
jriadana ( recovery of debts) and others. It formed the basis of 
the Vivadacandra of Misarumisra, the Vivada-cintamani of Vacaspati 
and the Dapdaviveka of Vardhamana. It is mentioned in his own 
Grhastharatnakara. 8 ™ 

The Vyavahararatnakara deals with judicial procedure, such as 
the plaint, the reply, the burden of proof, means of proof, judg- 
ment etc. Vide Mitra's notices, vol. VI. p. 66, No. 2036. 

The £udhiratnakara is in 34 tarafigas and deals with impurity 
on birth and death, persons who have to observe no asauca, mean- 
ing of sapiyda, rites on death up to the end of the period of mourn- 
ing, purifications of food and various substances. Vide Mitra*s 
Notices, vol. VII. p. 149, No. 2384 and I. O. cat. p. 412, No. 1389. 

For the Pfijaratnikara, vide Mitra's Notices, vol. Ill, p. 162, 
No. 2398. That work is mentioned :by Raghunandana in the 
Suddhi-tattva ( vol. II, p. 299 on Salagrama stone ). 

Besides this digest Capdeivara compiled several other works. 
Kftyacintamapi is one of such works. It is a question when it 
was composed. In his Grhastharatnakara he says that certain

architectural and decorative constructions called 5>rivfk§a, Vardhamana 
and Nandyavarta have been spoken of by him in the Kjrtyacinta- 
magi 880 But the Krtyacintamatji says that he has already compos- 
ed the seven ratnakaras. 881 

The Kftyacintamagi is divided into sections called praka&s. 
It deals with astronomical matters in relation to the performance of 
several religious ceremonies and samskaras, such as t&rdiuddhi, the 
intercalary month, garbhadhana, simantonnayana, birth of a child 
on the Mala nak§atra, the rites on the 6th day after birth, namaka- 
raija, the movements of Saturn, Sun's passage from one sign into 
another, the results of eclipses etc. 

Another work of Capdesvara, the Rajanitiratnakara, has been 
recently edited at Patna ( 1924 ) by Mr. K. P. Jayasval with a learned 
introduction dealing with the personal history of CandeSvara, his 
relations with the Maithila kings and the mediaeval Indian literature 
on politics. It appears that CandeSvara did not complete the writing 
of a work on politics when he compiled his great digest. He wrote 
the work at the command of the king Bhave£a ( or Bhavesvara ) 
of Mithila. 88 * The work contains 16* tarattgas ( waves, i. e. 
chapters ) on the following subjects : — definition of a king, different 
grades of kings, the eighteen vices or calamities for kings, duties of 
kings ; the characteristics and duties of amatyas { councillors ) ; 
the characteristics of purohita ; the characteristics and duties of a 
pradvivaka ( Judge ); the members of the hall of justice (sabhyas), 
their number and qualifications ; concerning forts ; the time and 
place and accessories of the settlement of royal policy ; concerning 
the state treasury; the army; the commander-in-chief and the 
discipline of the army ; ambassadors, allies, and spies ; the general 
obligations of kings, conflict of Dharma&stra and Arthasastra, the 
six guyas — samdhi etc., the mapdala of kings ; the king's 
power of punishment ; abdication by king, the heir-apparent, im- 
partibility of the kingdom ; the eldest son's right to succeed, the

seven constituent elements of the state ; the state's obligation 
towards the poor, the helpless etc.; the coronation of the heir- 
apparent or his investiture. 

There are two more works composed by Ca^desvara viz., the 
Danavakyavali and the Sivavakyavali ( vide I. O. cat. p. 1409, No. 
3724 for the latter). 

Candesvara names in his works, particularly in the Kjrtyaratnakara 
and the Vivadaratnakara, a host of writers and works. In his great 
digest he drew largely upon five predecessors and incorporated often 
without acknowledgment much or almost all that was valuable in 
them. These five predecessors were the Kamadhenu, the Kalpataru, 
the Parijata, the Prakasa (i. e. Smrtimaharnava) and Halayudha, 
all of which he quotes scores of times. At the end of the Vivada- 
ratnakara he boasts that whatever is of the essence in the above five 
works and even more is comprehended in his single work the Ratna- 
kara. 883 Among the authors and works mentioned in his seven 
ratnakaras, those mentioned below deserve to be noted. 88 * 
In I. L. R. 12 Cal. 348 (at p. 356) the learned judges appear to 
hold that the Parijata mentioned in the Vivadacintamani is the 
Madanaparijata. But this is obviously a mistake ( vide p. 309 above 
on Parijata). Besides these in his Rajanitiratnakara he names 
Kamandaka, Kullukabhatta, Pallava and Pallavakara, Srikara. What

vernacular words ( e. g. Krityaratnakara pp.109, in > 3°^* 338, 
443)- 

We learn a great deal about the family and personal history of 
Candesvara from his works. The Vivadaratnakara in the introduc- 
tion and in the colophon tells us that Candesvera was a mantrin 
(a minister), was entrusted with the office of minister for peace 
and war, that he conquered Nepal and weighed himself against gold 
on the banks of the Vagvati in iake 1236 ( 13 14 A. D. ). 88 * There 
are more or less similar colophons at the end of the Rajanitiratnakara 
and the other ratnakaras. The grand-father of Candesvara was 
Devaditya, 886 who was minister of Harasimhadeva of Tirhut and who 
belonged to the Karpata family. One of the sons of Devaditya was 
Viresvara who was also a minister for peace and war of the same 
king and is said to have made grants to learned Brahmapas in 
Ramapura ( i. e. Simraon in Champaran District ) and other cities 
( verse 10 of Kjrtyaratnakara ). Mr. Jayasval points out in his 
introduction to the Rajaniti-ratnakara ( j ) that the correct name of 
the king was Harisimhadeva. Another son of Devaditya was Gape- 
svara who was younger than VireSvara and who was also a great 
minister and author of Sugatisopana. A copy of • this work bears 
the date La-sam ( Lak§magasena era ) 224 ( i. e. 1343-44 A. D.). 887 
In the colophon of this work Devaditya is called 'mahamatta' 
( mahamatra ) and Ganeivara is styled maharajadhirija. In the

Srtddhaviveka of Rudradhara the Sugatisopana is said to be the 
work of one who was pratihastaka ( deputy ) of Bhava&trma. 818 
Cao4 c ^ vara was t * ie son °f VireSvara and like his father and grand- 
father became minister of Harisirhhadeva. This must have happen- 
ed about 1 3 10 A. D., as he weighed himself in 13 14 A. D. The 
Krtyaratnakara (verse 15) says that he touched the very idol of 
Pa&ipati in Nepal and worshipped it after conquering the country. 

From the Vyavahararatnakara it appears that Can4e£vara was 
Chief Judge as well as Minister for peace and war. 88 * Cai?de£vara 
and his ancestors are highly praised for their liberality. 8 * In the 
Danaratnakara ( verse 2 at the end ) he is said to have rescued the 
earth submerged in the flood of Mlecchas. 8 * 1 This probably refers 
to the defeat of some Mahomedan generals. Harisirhhadeva was 
routed by Ghiasuddin Tughlak in 1324 and retired from Tirhut

into Nepal. 892 Hence it follows that the seven Ratnakaras some 
of which ( like vivada and dana ) refer to his weighing himself 
against gold in 13 14 A. D. and his high position at the court of 
Harisimhadeva were composed between 13 14 and 1324 A. D. His 
Rajanltiratnakara was composed at the command of Bhavesa. This 
last belonged to the line of the Kamesvara dynasty which began to 
rule Tirhut in the third quarter of the 13th century, in 1370 A. D. 
according to Mr. Jayasval ( introduction to Rajanltiratnakara, r ). 
Therefore the literary activities of Candesvara extended over about 
50 years from 13 14 and the Rajaniti-ratnakara was probably his last 
work composed at a very advanced age. For the somewhat con- 
troversial and confused chronology of the Tirhut kings of the 
Karnata and Kamesvara dynasties, vide Hp. cat. ( Introduction p. 31); 
Grierson in Ind. Ant. vol. 14, p. 182-196 and Ind. Ant. vol. 28, p. 57; 
JASB 191 5 pp. 407-433 (M.M.Chakravarti); JBORS vol. IX, 
p. 300 and X, p. 37 (Jayasval). 

Candesvara exercised very great influence over Maithila and 
Bengal writers. Misarumisra, Vardhamana, Vacaspati-miSra and 
Raghunandana 8 * 3 very frequently quote him. The Viramitrodaya 
(p. 181 ) calls the Ratnakara c Paurastya-nibandha' (eastern digest). 

91. Harinatha 

Harinatha is the author of a digest called Smjtisara on several 

topics of dharmasastra. No part of this work has been yet printed. 

In the India Office there are two mss. of the Smrtisara ( I. O. cat. 

p. 448, No. 1488 and p. 449, No. 1489 ). The first cites 67 autho- 

. rities (pram&pak&h )on Dharmasastra, out of which the Karma- 

pradipa, the Kalpataru, the Kamadhenu, Kumara, GaneSvaramisra, 

VijiianeSvara, Vilamba (?), Smrtimanju§a and Harihara deserve 

special mention. This ms. contains the portion of the Smrtisara 

on the samskaras, rites on death, sraddha and prayascitta. The other 

ms. deals with the principal topics of vivada ( various titles of law) 

and vyavahara ( judicial procedure ), viz. partition, father's share 
■ ' ■ - ■ ■ ■ — 1 ■ ■ -

on partition, larger share to eldest son, persons excluded from 
partition and inheritance, impartible property; stridhana; the 
several kinds of sons ; succession to the property of the sonless ; 
re-union ; gambling and prize-fighting and other titles of law ; 
various methods of dayda (punishment); the various units of 
measure etc.; judicial procedure i. e. the plaint, the reply, the means 
of proof, viz, documents, witnesses, possession, reasoning, oaths, 
and ordeals ; review of judgment ; minority and dependence ; rules 
about succession according to various authors. This last portion 
appears to be a sort of supplement, wherein the views of Balarupa, 
Parijata, Halayudha, Kalpataru and of the Smrtisara itself on the 
order of succession to a man dying sonless are set forth. ViSvarupa 
and Srikara are named in the summary of Balarupa's views and the 
Prakasa at a later stage ( folio 148 b ). Bhavadeva-nibandha is 
also expressly named on possession. 

No information is given in the mss. about Harinatha himself. 
He is styled in the colophons ' mahamahopadhyaya. ' In several 
places he refers to the views of the Gaudas on fc&ra ; e. g. he 
cites the view of the Gaudas that on a fasting day or sraddha day 
one should not employ the twig used in dantadhavana and that 
when there is Ekadasi on two days a house-holder should observe 
a fast on the first and a yati on the second. It appears that he was 
not a Gauda but rather a Maithila. 

The India Office ms. of the vivdda portion of the Smrtisara is 
dated saihvat 1614 ( i. e. 1558 A. D. ). Another ms. of the same 
portion (vide Mitra's Notices, vol. V, p. 232, No. 191 3) was copied 
in Laksmana Jflrfwaf 363 i. e. 1469-1470 A. D. Sulapani quotes 
the Smrtisara in his Durgotsavaviveka. Misarumisra in his Vivada- 
candra several times refers to the opinions of the Smrtisara. 8 ** 
Hence it follows that the Smrtisara was composed before the last 
quarter of the 14th century. Candesvara in his voluminous work

nowhere refers to Harinatha nor does the latter refer to him. 
Hence they were probably contemporaries or not separated by any 
appreciable interval of time. As Harinatha mentions the Kalpataru 
and Harihara, he must be later than about 1250 A. D. If Gane£- 
varamisra 8 ** mentioned by Harinatha be the author of the Sugati- 
sopana ( which is extremely probable ) who was an uncle of Cagde- 
£vara, then Harinatha cannot be earlier than about 1300 A. D. 
and flourished at about the same time as Candesvara, viz, the first 
half of the 14th century A. D. Harinatha is quoted by Vacaspati- 
mi£ra in his Dvaitanirnaya, by Raghunandana ( in Udvahatattva 
vol. I, pp. 108, 119, Ahnikatattva vol.1, p. 240, Suddhitattva vol. 
II, p. 240), Kamalakara, Nilakapfha and a host of other later writers. 
In the Ekadasitattva p. 45 Harinatha is spoken of as upajivya by 
Vardbamana and Vacaspati. 

There are several works styled Smrtisara e. g. of Kesava&rma 
( Mitra's Notices, vol. II. p. 76 ), of Yadavabhflsapa-bhattacarya 
( Mitra's Notices, vol. IV p. 213 No. 1642 ), of Devayajiiika ( D. C. 
Ms. No. 266 of 1884-87 and 344 of 1886-92, the latter being called 
Smrtisarasariigraha ). Hence it often becomes difficult to say in the 
case of later works, what particular Smftisara is being quoted. 

92. Madhavacarya 

Madhavacarya is the brightest star in the galaxy of d&km&tya 
authors on dharma&stra. His fame stands only second to that of 
the great Safikaracarya. He had a most versatile genius and either 
himself wrote or inspired his brother Sayana and others to write 
voluminous works on almost all branches of Sanskrit literature. 
As an erudite scholar, as a far-sighted statesman, as the bulwark 
of the Vijayanagara kingdom in the first days of its foundation, as a 
sathny&sin given to peaceful contemplation and renunciation in old 
age, he led such a varied and useful life that even to this day his 
is a name to conjure with. Among his numerous works two 
deserve special mention here, viz : the ParaSara-madhavIya, his com- 
mentary on the Para£arasm?ti and the Kalanirnaya.

The Para&ra-midhaviya has been published several times, the 
edition in the B. I. series and in the Bombay Sanskrit series being 
the best known. In the following the Bombay edition has been 
used. This wprk is very extensive and occupies about 2300 print- 
ed pages in the Bombay edition. It is not a mere commentary on 
Parasara's text, but is in the nature of a digest of civil and religious 
law. The original smpi of Parasara contains no verses on vyavahara, 
but Madhavacarya hangs, on the slender peg of a single verse of 
Para£ara calling upon the king to rule his subjects with righteous- 
ness, his treatise on vyavahara that covers a little over a fourth part 
of the whole commentary (vide note 341 above an ParaSara ). 
The Para&ra-madhaviya is a work of authority on modern Hindu 
Law in southern India. 8 * 6 His style is lucid and he generally 
avoids lengthy and abstruse discussions. Besides numerous smpti- 
karas and puraijas he names the following authors and works — 
Apararka, Devasvamin, Purariasara, Prapancasara, Medhatithi, Viva- 
ranakara ( on the VedantasQtra ), Visvarupacarya, Sambhu, Sivas- 
vamin, Smpicandrika. The Parasara-madhaviya was amongst his 
earliest works. He tells us that there was no commentary on 
Parasara before him. 8 *7 

The Kalanirnaya of Madhavacarya has been published several 
times. In the following the B. I. edition has been used. He 
states that he wrote this work after he composed his commentary 
on the Parasarasmpi. 898 The work is divided into five prakaranas. 
The first ( Upodghata ) deals with a scholastic disquisition on 
Ma ( time ) and its real nature ; the 2nd ( called vatsara ) speaks 
of the year, its various lengths according as it is c&ndra, sdvana or 
sanra, of the two ay anas, of the seasons and their number, 
of the months ( cdndra and saura ), of the intercalary months, 
and the religious acts allowed and forbidden in intercalary months, 
of the two pakfas (fortnights); the third prakaratja ( pratipat- 
prakarapa ) deals with the meaning of the word titbi, duration of a

tithi, the fifteen tithis of a pakfa, two kinds of tithis, viz. Buddha ( i. e. 
not intermixed with another tithi on the same day ) and viddha 
( intermixed with another tithi on same day ), rules about the 
preference of the first tithi for particular religious rites and obser- 
vances ( for Gods and Manes ) when intermixed with the preceding 
and following titlris, the fifteen muhurtas of the day and of the night; 
the fourth ( dvitiyadi-tithi-prakararia ) extends the application of 
the rules about pratipad to the tithis from the second to the 
fifteenth and decides on what tithi ( whether intermixed with the 
preceding or the following ) certain vratas, such as Gaurivrata on 
the third, JanmastamI on the 8th, were to be performed ; the fifth 
( prakirijaka i. e. miscellaneous ) deals with rules about the deter- 
mination of nakfatras for various acts, the yogas and karaijas and 
rules about samkranti and eclipses and the actions proper for them. 

The Kalanirnaya besides the names of numerous sages, puranas, 
astronomical and astrological writers mentions the following works 
and authors : — Kaladarsa ( p. 83 ), Bhoja ( as having composed in 
Aryi metre a work on the &aiva agama ), Muhurta-vidhana-sara 
(p. 341 ), Vatesvarasiddhanta, Vasistha Ramayana, the Siddhanta- 
siromani ( of Bhaskaracarya ), Hemadri( p. 67 his vratakbayda and 
qvupphayda ). 

A good deal about the family and personal history of Madhava- 
carya can be gleaned from the above-mentioned two works and 
other treatises of Madhavacarya. From the Parasara-madha- 
viya we 8 ** learn that he was the son of Mayana and Srimati, :hat 
Sayaria and Bhoganatha were his younger brothers, that he was a 
student of the black Yajurveda and of the Baudhayana-sutra-carana 
and belonged to the Bharadvaja-gotra. The introductory verses 
and the colophon of the PrayaScitta-sudhanidhi* 00 of Sayaija corro- 
borate most of these particulars. A verse at the beginning of the

W. MUdhavacarya 37? 

Kalanir^aya tells us that Vidyatirtha, Bharatitlrtha and Srikantha 
were his teachers.* 01 The Para£ara-Madhaviya highly eulogises* 02 
Madhava, compares him to divine and semi-divine councillors like 
Atigirasa of Indra and says that he was the hereditary teacher 
( kulaguru ) and mantrin of king Bukkana ( or Bukka ). The colo- 
phons to the several works of Sayaria, the younger brother of 
Madhavacarya, show that these brothers were closely connected 
with four rulers of the Vijayanagar dynasty, viz. Bukka and his son 
Harihara, Kampa and his son Sangama. In the Yajnatantra-su- 
dhanidhi* * ( ms. in the Bhau Daji collection ) Sayana, the author 
of the bhasyas on the vedas, is said to be the kulaguru of Harihara, 
son of Sangama. In the Guruvamsa-kavya ( Vanivilasa Press ed. ) 
it is said that Vidyaranya was the pupil of Vidyatirtha, that he com- 
posed Vedabhasyas and published them in the names of Sayana and 
Madhava, that Harihara and Bukka were the most valiant of the five 
sons of Sangama ( v. 48 ), that • Vira Rudra was the sovereign of 
Harihara and Bukka and was defeated by the suratraya i. c. sultan. 
The same work says that Vidyaranya founded Vijayanagarl in 
sake 1258, vaisakha suddha 7 Sunday ( i. e. 30th April 1335 A. D. ) 
and crowned Harihara king.* ** 

Burnell in his introduction to the VamSabrahmana started the 
theory that Sayana and Madhava were identical and put forward an 
esoteric meaning on the verse that states that Sayana and Bhoganatha

were the younger brothers of Madhava. But the facts as culled 
from the works of these two great men and the inscriptions of 
contemporary Vijayanagara kings are too strong for the hypothesis 
of Burnell and make it look absurd. The whole subject about the 
relationship of Madhava, Sayana and Bhoganatha has been carefully 
examined by Rao Bahadur R. Narsimhachar in Ind. Ant. vol. 45 
pp. 1-6 and 17 ff and the theory of Burnell has been thoroughly 
refuted. Sayana and Bhoganatha were as real personages as Madha- 
vicarya himself. Madhavacarya in his later years became a sathny&sin 
and was named Vidyaranya. To the items of evidence adduced 
by R. B. R. Narsimhachar for establishing the identity of Madhava 
and Vidyaranya ( Ind. Ant. vol. 45 p. 18 ) I may add one more. 
The Viramitrodaya ascribes the commentary on Parasara composed 
by Madhava to Vidyaranya.^ It has however to be noted that 
the Guruvamsakavya ( Va^ivilasa Press ed. ) says ( V, 41-44 ) that 
Vidyaranya was different from both Sayana and Madhava. 

The chronology of the kings of Vijayanagara has been a fruitful 
source of controversy. It is not necessary to go into that chrono- 
logy in great detail here. It may be studied in such works as 
SeweU's c Forgotten empire ' and in E. I. vol. III. p. 36, E. I. vol. 
XIV p. 68, E. I. vol. XV p. 8. The following pedigree* * will be 
sufficient for thq purpose of connecting Madhava and his brothers 
with the kings of Vijayanagara. The earliest inscription is that of

is said to be a MahamandaleSvara and is spoken of as ' Sri-Vira- 
Hariyappa-Vodeya/ *° 6 The colophon of the Madhaviya Dhatu- 
vrtti describes Madhava as the great minister of Saftgamaraja, the son 
of Kamparaja.9°7 The Bitragunta grant in iake 1278 ( 1356 A. D. ) 
by Safigama II at the request of his teacher Srikanthanatha shows 
that Bhoganatha* 08 who composed the contents of the grant was a 
nartnasaciva ( gay or humorous companion ) of Saftgama II. We 
saw above that Srikantha was a teacher of Madhavacarya ana that 
Bhoganatha was the youngest brother of Madhavacarya. Bhoga- 
natha in order to be a poet and a nartnasaciva of a reigning sovereign 
must have been a grown-up man in 1356 A. D. and so Madhava- 
carya must have been quite an elderly person about that time. 
The Kalanirnaya tells us that in the cyclic year Isvara following 
immediately after iake 1258 iravaya was an intercalary month and 
that in the cyclic year Bhava that preceded iake 1258 ( i. e. in iake 
1256 ) Falguna was an intercalary month and then examines the 
intercalary months that occurred iu the cyclic years up to Vikari 
thereafter ( i. e. up to iake 128 1 ).* o8 a As the Kalanirnaya examines 
the intercalary months from iake 1256 ( i. e. 1334 A. D. ) to iake 
1281 (i.e. 1359 A. D. ), it follows that it was either composed 
during these years or immediately after this period. The ParaSara- 
madhaviya was composed before the Kalanirnaya. Rao Bahadur 
Narsimhachar states that in a copperplate grant dated 1386 A. D. 
it is said that Harihara( II) gave in the presence of Vidyaranya- 
sripada certain donations to three scholars who were the promoters

( pravartaka ) of the commentaries on the four Vedas ( Ind. Am, 
vol. 45 p. 19). Another inscription speaks of Vidyaraoyain 
1378 A. D.9°9 This shows that Madhavacarya had become a 
sathnydsin at least in 1377 A. D. Tradition says that Vidyiranya 
died in 1386 A. D. at the ripe old age of 90. Therefore we shall 
not be far wrong if we place the literary activity of Madhava-Vidya- 
ranya between 13 30-1385 A. D. From the remarks about inter- 
calary months it appears that the Parasaramadhavlya and Kalanir- 
naya were composed between 1335-1360 A. D. There was a 
tradition among pandits that it was Madhavacarya who composed 
bhasyas on the Vedas and ascribed them to his brother Sayaija. 
Kaslnatha, in his Vitthala-rnmantra-sara-bhasya says so.* 10 

Great confusion has been caused by identifying Madhava-Vidya- 
ranya with another scholar named Madhava who was also a mantrin 
of Bukka, who was a great warrior and was governor of Banavase and 
the country round Goa on the western coast. In a grant'" of the 
village Kucara, also called Madhavapura, dated iahe 1313(1 391 
A. D.), it is said that he routed the armies of the Turuskas, wrested 
Goa the capital of Konkana from them and re-established f he temple 
of Saptanatha ( i. e. Sapta-kotisvara ). There is another inscription 
dated lake 1290 ( i. e. 1368 A. D. ) where the great minister ( Maha- 
pradhdna ) Madhavaftka is stated to have ruled over Banavase 12000 
under king Bukkaraya ( Ind. Ant. vol. IV, p. 206 ). Fleet is 
wrong in identifying the minister Madhavaftka with Madhav&carya- 
Vidyaranya. Another grant from Goa (found by Dr. Bhau Daji ) 
says that Madhava-mantrin, son of Caundibhatta, established the 
Kfiga of Saptanatha ( JBBRAS vol. 9, p. 228 ). Vide E. C. vol. VIII, 
Sorab No. 375 dated sake 1268 ( Sunday Madhava 30, i.e. nth 
Feb. 1347 ), where we are told that Madhavamantrin was governor 
of Candragutti, capital of Banavase 12000, that he was minister of 
Marapa, younger brother of Harihara I and that he was a disciple of

Kriyafokti, a Saiva teacher. In E. C. vol. VII, Shikarpur 281 dated 
fake 1290 Kartika bahula 8 ( i. e. 13th November 1368 ) Madhava 
is said to have been a son of Giuoda of the Afigirasa gotra and a 
minister of Bukka I and his guru is said to have been Kaiivilasa 
Kriyasakti. 

From this it follows that the Madhava mantrin who was a 
governor of Banavase and Goa and was living in 1391 A. D. was 
the son of Caundibhafta and cannot be identified with Madhava- 
clrya who was the son of Mayana. 

There is a ms. in the Bombay University Library of a work 
called Kalanirnayakarika in 1 30 verses, which contains the introduc- 
tory verses of the Kalanirnaya dealing with the contents, though in 
a somewhat different order. There are several commentaries on 
the Kalanirnaya, viz. Kalanirnayadipika by Ramacandracarya com- 
posed about 1450 A. D., a commentary called Laksmi by Laksmidevi, 
wife of Vaidyanatha Payagunda. There is a Vivarana of the Kala- 
nirnayadipika, by Nrsiihha, son of Ramacandracarya ( vide D. C. 
Ms. No. 99 of 1871-72 ). 

93. Madanapala and Visvesvarabhatta 

The Madanaparijata compiled under the patronage of king 
Madanapala by Visvesvarabhatta is a famous work. Like Bhoja, 
Madanapala seems to have been a great patron of learning and 
several works are attributed to him. At least four works on 
dharmasastra are ascribed to him ( i. e. were written under his 
patronage ) viz the Madanaparijata, Smrtimaharijva or Madana- 
maharnava, Tithinirnayasara and Smrtikaumudi. 

The Madanaparijata is an extensive work printed in the B. I. 
series. There are 23 introductory verses, the first 13 of which give 
the genealogy of Madanapala. In the printed edition these 13 
verses are stated to have been added by Purobita &ri-Ramadeva. 
The last of the introductory verses states that the work was com- 
posed after a careful study of Hemadri, Kalpavrksa ( i. e. Kalpataru ), 
Apararka, Smjticandrika, Smrtyarthasara and Mitaksara.*" That 
Mada napala was only the patron and not the real author of the 



380 HMorytf BkarmntiUtra 

( pravartaka ) of the commentaries on the four Vedas ( Ind. Ant, 
vol. 45 p. 19). Another inscription speaks of Vidyaragya in 
1378 A. D.9° q This shows that Madhavacarya had become a 
satfinydsin at least in 1377 A. D. Tradition says that Vidyiranya 
died in 1386 A. D. at the ripe old age of 90. Therefore we shall 
not be far wrong if we place the literary activity of Madhava-Vidyi- 
ranya between 13 30-1 3 85 A. D. From the remarks about inter- 
calary months it appears that the Parasaramadhavlya and Kalanir- 
naya were composed between 1335-1360 A. D. There was a 
tradition among pandits that it was Madhavacarya who composed 
bhasyas on the Vedas and ascribed them to his brother Sayana. 
Kasinatha, in his Viuhala-rnmantra-sara-bhasya says so,* 10 

Great confusion has been caused by identifying Madhava-Vidya- 
ranya with another scholar named Madhava who was also a mantrin 
of Bukka, who was a great warrior and was governor of Banavase and 
the country round Goa on the western coast. In a grant* 11 of the 
village Kucara, also called Madhavapura, dated iake 1313 ( 1391 
A. D.), it is said that he routed the armies of the Turuskas, wrested 
Goa the capital of Konkana from them and re-established the temple 
of Saptanatha ( i. e. Sapta-kotisvara ). There is another inscription 
dated lake 1290 ( i. e. 1368 A. D. ) where the great minister ( Mahd- 
pradbdna ) Madhavaftka is stated to have ruled over Banavase 12000 
under king Bukkaraya ( Ind. Ant. vol. IV, p. 206 ). Fleet is 
wrong in identifying the minister Madhavaftka with Madhavacarya- 
Vidyaranya. Another grant from Goa (found by Dr. Bhau Daji ) 
says that Madhava-mantrin, son of Caundibhatta, established the 
Hflga of Saptanatha ( JBBRAS vol. 9, p. 228 ). Vide E. C. vol. VIII, 
Sorab No. 375 dated sake 1268 (Sunday Madhava 30, i. e. nth 
Feb. 1347 ), where we are told that Madhavamantrin was governor 
of Candragutti, capital of Banavase 12000, that he was minister of 
Marapa, younger brother of Harihara I and that he was a disciple of

ML MUdhaauarya S81 

Kriyaiakti, aSaiva teacher. In E. C. vol. VII, Shikarpur 281 dated 
lake i29oKartika bahula 8 (i. e. 15th November 1368 ) Madhava 
is said to have been a son of Caurida of the Aftgirasa gotra and a 
minister of Bukka I and his guru is said to have been Ka&vilasa 
Kriyasakti. 

From this it follows that the Madhava manirin who was a 
governor of Banavase and Goa and was living in 1391 A. D. was 
the son of Caundibhatta and cannot be identified with Madhava- 
carya who was the son of Mayana. 

There is a ms. in the Bombay University Library of a work 
called Kalanirnayakarika in 130 verses, which contains the introduc- 
tory verses of the Kalanirnaya dealing with the contents, though in 
a somewhat different order. There are several commentaries on 
the Kalanirnaya, viz. Kalanirnayadipika by Ramacandracarya com- 
posed about 1450 A. D., a commentary called Laksmi by LaksmldevI, 
wife of Vaidyanatha Payagunda. There is a Vivarana of the Kala- 
nirnayadipika, by Nrsiriiha, son of Ramacandracarya ( vide D. C. 
Ms. No. 99 of 1871-72 ). 

93. Madanapala and Visvesvarabhatta 

The Madanaparijata compiled under the patronage of king 
Madanapala by Visvesvarabhatta is a famous work. Like Bhoja, 
Madanapala seems to have been a great patron of learning and 
several works are attributed to him. At least four works on 
dharmasastraare ascribed to him (i.e. were written under his 
patronage ) viz the Madanaparijata, Smrtimaharpva or Madana- 
maharnava, Tithinirnayasara and Smftikaumudi. 

The Madanaparijata is an extensive work printed in the B. I. 
series. There are 23 introductory verses, the first 1 3 of which give 
the genealogy of Madanapala. In the printed edition these 13 
verses are stated to have been added by Purohita Sri-Ramadeva. 
The last of the introductory verses states that the work was com- 
posed after a careful study of Hemadri, Kalpavfksa (i. e. Kalpataru ), 
Apararka, Smrticandrika, Smjrtyarthasara and Mitaksara.*" That 
Madanapala was only the patron and not the real author of the 

912 ^ w^yM§H^w<i»W^ ^yro^ mCNfiwl ^ 1 faicrcnfNrafrn ^rr- 



882 Hiitorv <tf Dhcmnatastra 

work is made clear in several places. In the introductory verse 20 
it is stated that the work was compiled through ( lit. by the mouth 
of ) learned men.* 1 * In two places in the body of the work* 1 * it 
is said that the author has explained the matter under discussion in 
his work called Subodhini, a commentary on the Mitaksara. There- 
fore the Madanaparijata was really composed by Visvesvarabhafta, 
the author of the Subodhini. The Madanaparijata contains nine 
stabakas ( bunches i. e. chapters ) on brahmacarya, the dharmas 
of householders, the daily duties ( dhnika-krtya ), the sathskdras 
from garbhddhdna onwards ; impurity on birth and death, the puri- 
fication of various substances ( dravyaiuddhi ), irdddba, ddyabhdga 
( partition and inheritance ) and prdyaicitta. In the portion on the 
Dayabhaga it very closely follows the Mitaksara. Its style is simple 
and lucid. Besides the authors and works mentioned above it 
cites those noted below. 915 

There is a work called Maharnava ascribed to Mandhata, a son 
of Madanapala. In several mss. of this work deposited in the 
Deccan* 16 College there are introductory verses giving the genealogy 
of Madanapala that agree almost word for word with the introduc- 
tory verses of the Madanaparijata. Moreover two verses that speak 
of Visvesvarabhatta occur here also as well as in the Madanaparijata 
and Subodhini. This work also is said to have been compiled by

Mindhata through the learned.' 1 ? It is said to have been based on 
a study of the iruti, the smrtis and the purdyas. The work is 
divided into 40 tarafigas ( waves ). The principal subject* 18 of 
the work is to describe how the various diseases which human 
bodies are heir to are the result of evil deeds done in past lives 
( this subject being called Karmavipaka in dharmasastra works ) 
and to prescribe various rites and penances for the eradication of 
the evil results of evil deeds. Among the various rites and penances 
that are set forth in great detail may be mentioned the Kusmagda- 
homa, Rudraikadasini, Maharudrabhiseka, Vinayakasanti, the Nava- 
grahayajna &c. The Maharnava mentions the Karmavipaka of 
Satatapa, the Caturyarga-cintamani ( folio 234 a of D. C. no. 259 of 
1 886-1 892 ), the Mitaksara, the Karmavipaka-samuccaya &c. It 
is worthy of note that in the Smrti-kaumudi the authorship of 
the Maharnava is claimed by the author himself and is not ascribed 
to Madanapala's son.* 1 * 

The Tithinirnayasara is another work compiled under Madana- 
pala. Stein in his cat. of mss. at Jammu ( p. 306 ) gives extracts 
from this work. The first fourteen verses are the same as those in 
the Madanaparijata. It appears to have been composed by 
Visvanatha, which is most probably a paraphrase of the name 
Visvesvara. 920 

The Smrtikaumudi contains an introduction of 17 verses, 13 of 
which set forth the genealogy of Madanapala. The fourteenth 
verse tells us that Madanapala composed works called Yantraprakasa, 
Maharnava, Parijata, Siddhantagarbha and Tithinirnayasara.* 22 
The 1 5th verse says that he composes the Smrtikaumudi through

the learned.* 2 * The 17 verse says that his predecessors have 
generally dilated upon the dharmas of the three higher varyas and 
the dharmas of the iudra have not been dealt with by them as a 
principal topic, therefore he would clearly expound the dharmas 
of the last varpa. At the end of the ms. in the I. O. cat. it is 
described as the younger sister of the Madanaparijata and of the 
Maharpava.*** This is not found in the D. C. ms. which was 
copied in sarhvat 161 5. This work is divided into four kalol- 
lasas, each kalolldsa being subdivided into kiranas ( rays ). The 
first kalollasa has two kiranas, the second has four, the third and 
fourth five kiranas each. The subjects dealt with are : I two kinds 
of iftdras, viz : the kevalaiudra ( simple sfidra ) and one who is of 
mixed descent, being born of a sudra woman from a man of the 
higher castes ; the mixed castes ; II. general discourses on the £udra's 
adhikdra for engaging in various acts and performing various rites, 
such as the study of the vedas and smrtis, the performance of 
garbhadhana and other samskaras and the consecration of sacred fires ; 
samdhyavandana; thesudra's capacity for attaining the knowledge 
of brahman ; III. marriage ; different forms of marriage, prohibited 
degrees of blood relationship ( sapindya ), the various rites of 
marriage such as kanyadana; such samskaras as nama-karana 
( naming the child ), the duties of sudras in ordinary and difficult 
times ; asauca for sudras ; the various sraddhas for them ; the letting 
loose of a bull in honour of the dead ; IV. sudra's daily duties such 
as iauca, brushing the teeth, baths in the morning and at other 
times, brabmayajna, tarpaya, vaiivadeva, daily iraddha, dinner, &c 

The Smjtikaumudi mentions among others Apararka, Kftya- 
kalpataru, Mitak§ara, Medhatithi, Yajiiaparsva and Smrtimanjari. It 
also quotes from the Vedanta-kalpataru* 2 * and the author claims 
the Madanaparijata as his own work. 

It has been seen how all the four works set out above were 
composed under the patronage of Madanapala and how they were

probably from the pen of Visvesvarabhafta. There is one more 
work on Dharmasastra which Visvesvarabhatfa composed in his 
own name without the shelter of a patron's name. It is the 
Subodhini, a commentary on the Mitaksant of Vijnanesvara. The 
vyavahara portion of it has been published in Bombay by Mr. S. S. 
Setlur and also by Mr. J. R. Gharpure. Mr. Govind Das had seen 
portions of the Subodhini on the prayakitta section also. The 
Subodhini does not comment on each word of the Mitaksara but 
explains only important passages. It is a learned work. This was 
the earliest composition of Visvesvarabhatta, since it is mentioned 
even in the Madanaparijata. The first verse of the Subodhini is 
also the opening verse of the Maharriavaand of the Smrtikaumudi.^ 26 

From the verses* 2 ? 21 and 22 in the introduction to the Madana- 
parijata it appears that VisveSvara was the son of Pedibhatta and 
Ambika, that he was of the Kausikagotra and was the pupil of 
Vyasaranya-muni. In the Subodhini also the verse 'mata &c. ' 
occurs at the end with slight suitable variations and the verse 
* matiryesam ' in the beginning. The second introductory verse in 
Mr. Gharpure's edition makes Vifivesvara the son of Appabhatta, 9 * 8 
while Mr. Setlur reads c Peftibhatta ' which is probably a misreading 
for Pedibhatta. From his father's name it appears that Visvcsvara 
was a native of the Dravida country* 2 * and migrated to Northern India 
in search of patronage after he wrote the Subodhini. Visvesvara 
is regarded as one of the leading authorities of the Benares School

In the Sflryasiddhintaviveka of Madanapala the father of Mada*. • 
napala is said to be Saharana*" which is a Prakrit equivalent of; 
Sadharapa. Madanapala appears to have been a very great patron > 
of learned men and is said to have emulated the fame of Bhoja.^^ 
Besides the four works described above he compiled several other . 
works, the most famous of which is his dictionary of drugs called , 
Madanavinodanighantu; That work is very extensive, contains , 
about 2250 verses and is divided into fourteen vargas, the last ofi 
which contains a praiasti of his family. ** * This work contains tl^

of Bhoja and to Bhaskara's works. The ms. was copied in sathvai 
1459, i. e. 1402-3 A. D. In the colophon of this 7/ork his birudas 
( titles ) are Panditaparijata and Abhinava-Bhoja, and he is also 
styled Maharajadhiraja.^ In the Madanaparijata and the Mahar- 
nava the birudas are Panditaparijata and Katafamalla or Katfaramalla. 
A work called Anandasanjivana on singing, dancing, musical 
instruments and ragas is ascribed to Madanapala.* 41 The king 
Madana, son of Saharana, who is connected with the restoration of 
Medhatithi's bhasya, must be this Madana. 

A great deal has been written concerning the date of Madanapala. 
The introductory verses giving the genealogy of Madanapala must 
be held to be genuine, as they occur in the ancient ms. (D. C. 
No. 131 of A 1882-83 ) of Maharnava copied in samvat 1645 
( 1588-89 A. D. ) and in the still older ms. ( dated sathvat 1459 ) 
of the Surya-siddhanta-viveka. As the Madanaparijata mentions 
the Smrticandrika and Hemadri's Caturvarga-cintamani not only 
in the introductory verses of the Madanaparijata but in the body of 
the Madanaparijata and the Maharnava, Madanapala must be certain- 
ly later than 1300 A. D. As the Smrtikaumudi mentions the 
Vedamakalpataru that was composed in the time of the Yadava 
princes Kfsna and Mahadeva, it follows that the work was compos- 
ed after the third quarter of the 13th century. The Madanapari- 
jata is quoted in the Nrsimhaprasada, the Antyestfpaddhati of Nara- 
yanabhatfa, the Ahnikatattava ( pp.326, 397, 479, vol. I) of Raghu- 
nandana, the Sraddhakriyakaumudi (pp. 327, 489) of Govtndananda. 
Therefore it is certainly earlier than 1500 A. D. And if we rely 
on the date when the ms. of the Suryasiddhantaviveka was copied 
(viz. 1402-3 A. D.), it follows that Madanapala flourished before 
1400 A. D. The Madanavinodanighantu 94 * gives the date of its

composition as ' Brahmajagad-yugendu ' of the Vikrama era, 
ntdgha 6 of the bright half and Monday ( i.e. 8-1-1 375 A. D. ). 
This was interpreted by Sarvadhikari ( Tagore Law Lectures 
pp. 297-298, ed. of 1922 ) as equal to 123 1 of the Vikrama era 
( i. e. 1 175 A. D. ). He held that 'yuga' meant two. But 
herein he was entirely wrong. Besides, the date proposed by him is 
impossible, since it would lead us to hold that Madanapala wrote in 
1175 A. D. and since, as we saw above, he could not have flourished 
before 1300 A. D. It has been already shown (pp. 309, 369) that the 
view of Sarvadhikari and others that the Parijata mentioned by Cande- 
svara is the same as Madanaparijata is quite wrong. Astronomical usage 
as found in Bhaskara and other writers always interprets yugaw as 
meaning four ( and not two ) and hence the date of the compo- 
sition of the Madanavinodanighantu is 143 1 of the Vikrama era 
( i. e. 1375 A. D. ). Vide Jolly's Tagore Law lectures pp. 14-15,

is one of the last ( if not the last ) works of Madanapala is dated in 
1402-3 A. D. Hence the-literary activity of Madanapala and of his 
protegee, Vi£vesvarabhafta, must be placed between 13 60- 13 90 A.D. 

94. Madanaratna 

The Madanaratna is an extensive digest on Dharmasastra no 
part of which has yet been printed. In the colophons of mss. it is 
also called Madanaratnapradlpa or simply Madanapradipa. The 
work was divided into seven** 4 sections called uddyotas on samaya 
(or kala), Oc&ra, vyavahara, prayaicitta, dana, iuddbijanti. The order 
of the various sections was the one indicated, the samayoddyota 
being the first part. I have not been able to examine the mss. 
of all the uddyotas.

The Samayoddyota deals with the subjects usually treated of in 
works on kala, vix discussions about the year, the seasons, the 
months, the intercalary months, the rules about tithis, the rules about 
the proper times for various religious observances, gifts, hotna 9 
the rules about kalivarjya. 

There is a ms. of the Danoddyota in the AnandaSrama collection 
at Poona ( No. 2378 ). The following are the subjects treated of > 
eulogy of ddna ; the nature of d&na, various kinds of ddnas ; the 
constituent elements ( Mgdni ) of ddna ; the donor, proper persons 
for gifts, persons undeserving of gifts, what things cannot be given 
away, proper and improper times and places for dana, measures of 
corn and other substances and weights and units of length &c, 
finding out the east and other directions, characteristics of a torana, 
pataka and matjdapa, tuld-purusa ( weighing oneself against gold or 
silver ), gift of a thousand cows and other magnificent gifts, dedi- 
cation of a tank or well and planting of a garden &c. In this 
work the author refers to Kalpataru and to Hemadri as a daksina- 
tyanibandhakara. 

Deccan College ms. No. 392 of 1891-95 deals with the ianti > 
section. It treats of rites for propitiating gods and planets and 
averting the evil consequences of great or small portentous pheno- 
mena, such as Vinayaka-snana, surya-santi, navagraha-santi, santis 
for birth on certain evil nakfutras like mula, aileja and evil astro- 
logical conjunctions like vyattpata, vaidhrti, sathkranti ; rites for the . 
safety of the foetus and of the newly born infant ; ayutahoma ; la k$a- 
boma, kotibotna &c. In this section sages like Uttara-Garga, Katyayana, . 
Natada, Baijavapa ( on grhya ), Manava-samhita, Yajiiavalkya, , 
Saunaka and puranas like the Skanda, Bhavisyottara, Visrtudhar- 
mottara are very frequently cited. Besides the following are among . 
the authors and works referred to : — ApeksitarthadyotinI, a com- 
mentary of Narayana, Karmavipakasaihgraha, Karmavipakasamuccaya, 
Kumaratantra promulgated by the son of Ravapa, Prayogasara, 
VijnaneSvaracarya ( in the plural). 

A ms. of the Acaroddyota is noticed by Burneil in. his Tanjore ■ 
cat. ( p. 137 b ). Stein (an his cat. of Jammu mss. ) notices an in- 
complete ms. of the Vyavaharoddyota ( p. 98 No. 2437 ). 
M. M. Haraprasad Sastri notices a ms. of the PrayaScittoddyota • 
( Nepal Palmleaf and Paper mss. cat. XVIII and p. 223 ). 



W. Madanaraina 391 

From the colophons at the end of the several mss.of the Madana- 
ratna it appears that the work was composed under the patronage 
of king Madanasirfiha-deva, son of £aktisimha."* The king is 
styled maharajadhiraja and one of his titles is kodanda-parasurama 
( meaning ' who was a veritable ParaSurama in wielding the bow ). 
The introductory verses** 6 to the Samayoddyota in the Vi$ram-bag 
collection and the Ulwar ms. refer to Delhi-de£a and its king named 
Mahipaladeva. Then verse 9 speaks of Damodara whose exact 
relationship with Mahipaladeva is not clear. Damodara is said to 
have made the yavanas of Malasthdna ( modern Multan in the 
Punjab ) give up the slaughtering of cows. The whole pedigree 
is given below.w Saktisimha is said to have eclipsed even Bhoja.

It is further said that Madanasirhha called** 8 together four learned 
men, viz., Ratnakara, Goplnatha, Vi£vanatha and GaAgadhara- 
bhafta and entrusted the composition of the digest to them. The 
colophons?** at the end of the Santyuddyota in the Deccan College 
says that it was composed by Visvanatha, a resident of Benares 
and son of Bhattapujya, aSrlmall Gurjara ( Brahmana). There is 
a similar colophon at the end of the Prayascittoddyota noticed by 
M. M. Haraprasad Sastri. 

Since the Madanaratna mentions the Mit., the Kalpataru and 
Hemadri, it must be certainly later than about 1300 A. D. It is 
quoted as a great authority by the writers of the 16th and 17th 
centuries, such as Narayanabhafta, Kamalakarabhafta, Nilakanjha 
and MitramiSra. In the Vyavahara-mayukha Nilakantha relies upon 
the Madanaratna as often as ( if not oftener than ) the Mitaksara. 
The Viramitrodaya** says that the author of the Madanaratna refers 
to the views of the Mitaksara, Kalpataru, and Halayudha. From 
this it follows that the Madanaratna was composed at some time 
between 13 50-1 500. Madanasirhha and his ancestors are spoken 
of as ruling the country about Delhi. Though Madanasirhha bears 
the high-sounding title of maharajadhiraja it is highly probable 
that he was some feudatory chief under the Mahomedan rulers of 
Delhi. It is difficult to conceive of a period between 1300 and 
1500 A. D. when a Hindu ruler was king of Delhi. It may be 
that during the troublous times of Muhammad Tughlak (i3 2 5* 
1351 A. D. ), when the capital was transferred from Delhi to 
Doulatabad, or during the weak rule of the last kings of the Tughlal:

have usurped some territory about Delhi and ruled over it. 
At all events it would not be far from correct if the Madanaratna 
be placed about 1425-1450 A. D. Dr. Jolly ( R. u. S. p. 37 ) 
says that the Madanaratna names the Ratnakara and the Madhaviya. 
M. M. Haraprasad Sastri ( Report on palm-leaf and paper mss. from 
Nepal, Intro, pp. 31-32 ) tells us that the dynasty to which Madana- 
simhadeva belonged ruled over Gorakhpur-Champaran ( Western 
Tirhut ), that Madanasimhadeva was preceded by Saktisimhadeva, 
whose predecessor was Prthvisirhhadeva. The learned Sastri 
further says that a ms. of the Madanaratnapradlpa-prayascittoddyota 
applies the title s kodaridaparasurama * to Madana ( p. 223 ), that a 
ms. of the Amarakosa was copied in samvat 151 1 ( 1454-55 A. D. ) 
when Madanasimha ruled over Campakaranyanagara ( p. 5 1 of the 
body of the Report ) and that a ms. of the Narasimhapuraga was 
copied in La-sam 339 ( 1457-58 A. D. ) when maharajadhiraja 
Madanasimhadeva ruled over Gorak§apura i. e. modern Gorakhpur 
( p. 29 of the Report ). The great similarity of the names Madana- 
pala and Madanasimha misled J. C. Ghose ( Hindu Law, vol. II, 
p. XIV, ed. of 19 17 ) into holding that the Madanaparijata and the 
Madanaratna were written under Madanapala. But it is clear from 
the ancestry of the two kings, Madanapala and Madanasimha, and 
the names of the real authors of the digests (Madanaparijata 
and Madanaratna) that they have no connection with each other. 

95. Sulapani 

Next to Jimutavahana, Salaparji is the most authoritative Bengal 
writer on dharma&stra. Rai Bahadur M. M. Chakravarti gave a 
very interesting account of his works and time in JASB for 191 5, 
pp. 336-343- 

The earliest work of Salapani appears to have been his Dipa- 
kalika, a commentary on the smrti of Yajnavalkya. It is a very brief 
commentary. The portion on the dayabhaga section ( Yajnavalkya 
H, verses 1 14-149 ) is contained in five printed pages ( vide Ghose's 
Hindu Law, edition of 1917, vol. II. pp. 550-554 ). In this com- 
mentary, besides the sages he names only a few writers and works 
on dharma, e. g. the Kalpataru, Govindarftja, the Mitaksara, Medha- 
tithi and ViSvarUpa.. He entertained somewhat archaic views on 
batters of inheritance. For example, he holds that the text speak- 
l &g of the right of the parents to succeed before the brothers of the 



394 History of DhdrmaiUstrn 

deceased has reference to property acquired by the deceased 
from his father or grand-father. He explained the word 
' apratisfhita ' in the sutra of Gautama ' stridhanam duhitn&m- 
aprattanam-apratisthitanarii ca ' in the same way as Apararka, 
Jimutavahana and the Smrticandrika.** 1 He says that a full brother 
though not re-united succeeded before a half-brother though 
re-united.*** This explanation of the much canvassed verse of Yaj. 
offered by Sfllapaiji is refered to by the Viramitrodaya.**' The 
Vyavaharatattva of Raghunandana several times refers to Sulapigi's 
explanations of Yaj.*** 

Solapani wrote several small treatises on topics of dharma&stra 
and intended them to form part of a huge digest called Smjtiviveka. 
Fourteen such works are known to have been so written with titles 
ending in the word 'viveka, ' viz. Ekadasi-viveka, Tithi-viveka, 
Dattaka-v^veka, Durgotsavaprayoga-viveka, Durgotsava-viveka, Dola- 
yatra-viveka, Pratistha-viveka, Prayascitta-viveka, Rasayatra-viveka, 
Vratakala-viveka, £uddhi-viveka, Sraddha-viveka, Samkranti-viveka, 
Sambandha-viveka ( on marriage ). Of these the Durgotsavaviveka 
seems to have been amongst his latest works, since he names 
therein five of his vivekas on dufgotsava-prayoga, pratistha, prayas- 
citta, suddhi and sraddha. The Sraddha-viveka is the most famous 
of his works and has been printed. His Prayascittaviveka and 
Durgotsava-viveka have also been published, the former by Jivananda 
( 1893 ) and the latter by the Sanskrit Sahitya Parisad at Calcutta in 
Bengali characters. In the Durgotsava-viveka he deals with the 
worship of Durga in Asvina and also in spring ( hence the deity is 
called Vasanti ). In the Durgotsava-viveka, besides such puranas 
as the Kalika, Bhavisyottara, Bhagavata, Devi, he names a host of 
writers and works as noted below.** * In spite of Aufrecht's view

the Sathvatsara-pradipa is not his own work. A Sarasamuccaya 
is also mentioned in Hemadri ( Dana-khanda page 135). The 
Smjtisagara is probably the same as the Govindarnava of Sesa 
Nrsiihha or the work of the same name which Kulluka appears to 
have composed. Srikaramisra is probably the ancient author 
referred to even by the Mitaksara. 

The Sraddha-viveka has several commentaries by eminent writers 
such as Srinatha Acaryacudamani and Govindananda. So there are 
commentaries on the Prayascittaviveka. Besides the above, the 
works and authors mentioned in the other vivekas are noted below.** 6 
The Sraddha-viveka of Sulapani is referred to ( as Gaudiya-sCaddha- 
vivcka) by Rudradhara,**? by Vacaspati in his Sraddha-cintamani, by 
Govindananda in his Sraddhakriyakaumudi and by Raghunandana 
in several of his tattvas. 

We know very little about the personal history of Sttlapani. In 
the colophons of his works** 8 he is styled Sahudiyala (or-na) Maha- 
mahopadhyaya and Raghunandana also calls him Mahamahopadhyaya. 
The Sahudiyala was a degraded section of the Radhiya Brahmanas 
in Bengal from the days of Ballalasena. As Rudradhara calls him 
Gaudiya, it follows that Sulapani was a Bengal Brahmana. There 
is a tradition that he was the Judge of king Laksamanasena of 
Bengal. But this is impossible as the following discussion about 
his date will show. 

There is some uncertainty about the exact age of Sfclapani. As 
Sulapagi names the Ratnakara of Candesvara and the Kalamadhavlya, 
he must be later than about 1375 A. D., since some time 
must have elapsed before a work from Vijayanagar came to be 
regarded as an authority in Bengal. As Sulaparii's works are 
mentioned by Rudradhara, Govindananda and Vacaspati, the former 
must be earlier than about 1460. In this connection it has to be 
noted that Govindananda not only comments upon £ftlapani's

works but probably looks upon Sulaparu as an old writer along with 
Aniruddha.9s* 

A ms. of the Prayascittaviveka was copied at Benares intake 1410 
( i. e. 1488 A, D. ).* 6 ° From all these data it follows that Solapa^i 
flourished between 1375 and 1460 A. D. 

From the Suddhittatva it appears that Sulaparii wrote Parifisfc- 
dipakalika ( probably a commentary on a Grhyaparisisja )* 6f . 

96* Rudradhara 

This is a well-known Maithila writer on Dharmasastra, who com- 
posed several works. His Suddhi-viveka has been published several 
times (at Benares in 1866, in 1878 and by the VeftkateSvara Press 
in Bombay, sathvat 1978 ). That work is divided into three 
par icchedafi and deals with purification from impurity on birth and 
death, the persons liable to undergo purifications, the meaning of 
the word putra, purification of the body and of various substances 
when polluted, purification of cooked food and water and women 
in their menses. He tells us that after* 62 having examined seven 
works ( nibandhas ) on suddhi and being encouraged by his father 
and brother he composed the Suddhiviveka. He further says that 
he made the effort for the benefit of those who were not disposed 
to go through such works as the Ratnakara, Parijata, Mitaksara and 
the Haralata.**3 Besides these he mentions the Acaradar£a, Suddhi- 
pradipa, &uddhi-bimba, Sridattopadhyaya, Smjtisara and Harihara. 

The Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara is the most famous of his 
works. It was printed at Benares in sathvAt 1920. The work is

divided into four paricchedas. He first defines £rtddha, and then 
treats of several topics, viz. the varieties of Sraddha, the procedure 
at fraddhas, the mantras that are recited, the proper time and place 
for sraddhas, the Brihmanas worthy to be invited at grztddha and 
the proper food etc. Among the numerous works and authors 
referred to in the work the undermentioned ones deserve notice.' 6 * 
He refers to his own &uddhiviveka as already written. 

In several places he tells us that he follows a different tradition 
on certain matters from that of th6 Pitrbhakti or of the Sugatisopana. 
He points out that the prasatika is a kind of grain known in 
Madhyadek as &athlla.*s 

For his Vratapaddhati, vide Mitra's Notices, vol. VI, p. 15, 
No. 1995. He says that he was urged by his brother's advice to write 
the work and that he follows the Samayapradipa.* 66 

Another work of his is the Varsakrtya which deals with festivals 
and fasts. 

He was the son of Mahamahopadhyaya Lak§midhara and young- 
est brother of Haladhara. His works are quoted by Vacaspati in 
bis Dvaitanirnaya, by Govindananda in the &raddhakriyakaumudi, 
by Raghunandana in several of his tattvas, by Kamalakara and 
Nilakaotha. 

As Rudradhara mentions the Ratnakara, the Smrti&ra, §ridatto- 
padhyaya and the Sraddhaviveka of Sftlapani, he is certainly later 
than 1425 A. D. A ms. of his Vratapaddhati is dated in Laksmana 
satiivat 344 i. e. 1463 A. D.* 6 * Besides he is quoted by Vacaspati 
and Govindananda. Therefore he must have flourished between 
1425 and 1460 A. D.

Hi HUtomcf 

The Rudradhara who was a pupil of Can4e$vara and author of 
the Kftyacandrika, the Vivadacandrika and the Sraddhacandrika 
appears to be a different author. 

i 
97. Misarumisra 

MisarumiSra is famous for his works called Vivadacandra and 
Padartha-candrika ( on the Nyiya-VaiSesika system ). There is a 
ms. of the Vivadacandra in the Deccan College (No. 57 of 1883-84). 
That work deals with the titles of Law ( vyavaharapadas ) such as 
roadana ( recovery of debt ), nyasa ( deposit ), asvamivikraya, 
sambhuya-samutthana ( partnership ), dayavibhAga, stridhana ; and 
then with procedure, viz. the plaint, reply, pramanas, witnesses, 
possession etc. It frequently quotes the Ratnakara ( on vivada and 
vyavahara ) of Caiide£vara and several times criticizes him* 
Besides numerous smrti writers the other authors and works named 
are : Parijata, PrakaSa, BalarQpa ( often ), Bhavadeva and Smjtisara 
( frequently ). 

In the mss. and colophons the name of the author seems to be 
MisarumiSra.* 68 He tells us that he wrote the work under the orders 
of princess Lachimadevi, wife of prince Candrasixhha who appears 
to have been the younger brother of Bhairavasimhadeva of the 
Kamesvara dynasty of Mithila. The work was probably called Vivada- 
candra to connect it with the prince Candrasimha. The Vivada- 
candra first? 6 * speaks of king BhaveSa of the Kame£vara dynasty, then 
of his son Harasimhadeva, then of his son Darpanartyaija and the 
hitter's queen Hira or Dhira and then of Candrasimha and his queen 
Lakhima or Lachima. We saw above that Cande^vara who had 
weighed himself against gold in 1314 A. D. wrote in his old age

under Bhave&t his work on Rajanlti. Lachimadevi was queen of the 
great-grandson of this BhaveSa, who became king of Tirhut in the 
third quarter of the 14th century. Therefore Candrasimha must 
have flourished about the middle of the 15th century and Misaru- 
misra's work must be assigned to that period. M. M. Chakravarti 
points out ( JASB for 19 15, p. 425 ) that for Dhirasimha, a son of 
Darpanarayapa, there is an authentic date, viz. 321 of the Lak§mana- 
sena era in Tirhut ( i. e. 1438 A. D. ), when a ms. of £rinivasa's 
Setudarpaoi ( com. on Setubandha ) was copied during Dhirasithha's 
reign. 

That the Vivadacandra is a work of authority on Hindu Law in 
Mithila has been recognised from very early days in the British 
courts." The Vivadacandra held that the word stridhana was to be 
applied to such woman's property as was technically so called ( by 
the sages ) and not to all property that comes to a woman." 1 

98. Vacaspatimisra 

Vacaspatimisra is the foremost nibandha writer of Mithila. His 
Vivadacintamani has been recognised by the High Courts in India 
and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as a work of 
paramount authority on matters of Hindu Law in Mithila.' 7 * 
Vacaspati was an extremely voluminous writer and appears to have 
composed dozens of works. In the Sraddhakalpa alias Pitjrbhakti- 
tarangini, almost his latest work, he says that he wrote in his youth 
ten works on sastra and thirty nibandlms on smrti and composed 
the work in question in his declining years.'™ At least eleven 
works of his bearing the title c cintamani ' are known. They are 
briefly noticed below. 

The Aciracimamaiji deals with the daily rites of Vajasaneyins.*™

Krtyacintamani was published in Bengali characters at Benares in 
iake 1814 (vide JASB. for 1915, p. 395) and deals with the 
festivals that are celebrated on different days in the year. The 
Tirthacintamani has been published in the B. I. series. It is 
divided into five prakaias, viz. Prayaga, Purusottama (Puri), 
Gafiga, Gaya and Varanasi and deals with such topics as the purpose 
of pilgrimages, the preliminaries of pilgrimage, the various rites 
to be performed at the several tlrtbas, the subsidiary sacred places 
at the principal Hrthas etc. He mentions the Kalpataru, Ganesvara- 
mi£ra, Jayasarma, the Mitaksara, Smrtisamuccaya and Hemadri. 
In the introduction he explicitly states that he composed the work 
after carefully examining the Krtyakalpadruma and Parijata, the 
Ratnakara and other works. 9 " The Dvaitacintamani is mentioned 
in his Krtyacintamani. The Niticintamani is mentioned in the 
Vivadacintamani ( p. 72 ). The Vivadacintamaiii ( text ) was 
published at Calcutta in 1837 ( which edition is used in this 
work ) and was translated into English by Prasannakumar 
Tagore (in 1863 ) with a learned preface. It explicitly states 
that the author carefully studied the Krtyakalpadruma, Parijata 
and Ratnakara. n* The work deals exhaustively with the 
eighteen titles of law ( vyavahdrapadas ). The principal authors 
and works, besides the usual smrtis and puranas, mentioned in the 
work are noted below.*" In this work he mentions several vernacular 
equivalents for Sanskrit terms. The Vyavaharacintamagi' 78 deals 
with judicial procedure, viz. the four principal topics thereof, viz. 
. bhasa ( the plaint ), uttara ( reply of defendant ), kriyi ( evidence ),

The Sudracaracintamani deals with the duties of Sudras ( Mitra's

Besides these there is a group of Vacaspati's works with the title 
i nirgaya \ The Tithinirnaya* 80 starts with an invocation of the 
highest Being ( paramdtman ) while most of his works are begun 
with an obeisance to Hari or Kjrsna. It first divides tithis into 
suddha and viddha ( commingled with another tithi ) and then 
discusses all the tithis from the first to the fifteenth and also amdvdsyd; 
it deals with the questions as to the rites of that tithi which is kjaya, 
with sivaratrivrata, naktavrata, holidays, fasts, jayantivrata, holika 
festival etc. The Dvaitanirnaya,' 81 as its name implies, is concern-

ed with the settlement of some doubtful points of DhArmasastra 
such as the names to be given to brahmanas and the other varyas, 
doubts on gifts and consecration of tanks and wells, doubts about 
daily bath, sarndhyd, devapaja, vaisvadeva, daily offerings to manes, 
about judicial proceedings and the taking of interest, about various 
vratas like ekadasi and janmastami, about intercalary months, about 
the proper time for marriage and upamyana. The Mahadana- 
nirnaya* 82 expatiates on the sixteen munificent gifts such as weigh- 
ing against gold and silver. In the introductory verses Vacaspati 
gives the genealogy of his patron's family from Bhavesa, whose son 
was Harasimhadeva, whose son was Narasiriiha, whose son Bhaira- 
vendra bore the biruda ( appellation ) Hari-narayana. A versed 
at the beginning and one at the end attribute the work to Bhaira- 
vendra and to Rupanarayana respectively. Rupa-narayana was 
the biruda of Ramabhadra, a son of Bhairavendra. Therefore it 
looks probable that the work was commenced in the reign of 
Bhairava and was completed in the reign of his son Ramabhadra. 
M. M. Chakravarti says that Bhairava himself bore at one time the 
biruda Rupanarayana. M. M. Haraprasad Sastri ( Nepal cat. p. 90 ) 
mentions a Vivadanirnaya of Vacaspati. The Suddhinirnaya of 
Vacaspati deals with impurity on birth and death, the religious acts 
that must be performed even in times of impurity, saphjda relation- 
ship, periods of impurity for the principal varnas and mixed castes; 
periods of impurity on abortion, the deaths of infants and women, 
accidental deaths etc., over-lapping of several periods of aiawa; 
impurity arising from carrying a corpse ; rites after the death of a 
sathnyfisin ; impurity from contact of lower castes, such as washer- 
men and candalas, freedom from impurity at tirthasand marriages etc.

Besides these, Vacaspati appears to have either composed or 
contemplated writing seven works called Maharnava on krtya, acara, 
vivada, vyavahara, dana, suddhi and pitryajna. Of these the Krtya- 
maharnava is found and deals with festivals and fasts and the proper 
times therefor ( vide JASB for 191 5, p. 398). He also wrote the 
GayaSraddhapaddhati, the Candana-dhenupramana and the Dattaka- 
vidhi. Probably his last work, as stated above, was the Sraddhakalpa 
alias Pitrbhaktitarafigini. 

Apart from the works on dharmasastra, Vacaspati wrote also on 
the systems of philosophy. But it is not necessary for our purpose 
to go into that question. 

Most of his works styled € cintamani ' are mentioned by Raghu- 
nandana in the tattvas (e. g. Krtyacintamani in Ekadasltattva, Vivada- 
and Vyavahara-cintamani in Dayatattva ). The Suddhicintamapi is 
quoted in the Suddhitattvarnava of Srinatha-acarya-cudamani, the 
Sraddha-cintamani is quoted in the Sradhha-kriya-kaumudl (pp.265, 
475 ) and in the Suddhikaumudl ( pp. 89, 93 ) of Govindananda, 
the Vivada-cinfamani is quoted in the Viramitrodaya ( p. 697 ) and 
the Vyavaharacintamani is criticized in the same work ( p. 288 ). 
His Pitrbhakti-tarangini is mentioned in the Suddhitattva and 
Sraddhatattva. Vacaspati vouchsafes very little information about 
himself or his family. In the colophons of his works he . is 
generally styled mahamahopadhyaya and miira or sanmiira. 
In the colophon of the Sudracara-cintamani^ he is described 
as the parifad ( the adviser of the king in finally deciding 
difficult points of Dharmasastra ) of MahardjadhirAja Hari- 
narayana. We saw above that his Mahadananiqjaya connects 
itself with two kings Bhairava and his son Rupanarayana. 
At the end of the &raddhakalpa we are told that Vacaspati who was 
the parifad of Ramabhadradeva alias RGpanarayana, son of Hari-

niriyaoa, composed the work at the bidding of his patron.* 8 * 
Vardhamana in his Dapdaviveka says that one of his gurus was 
Vacaspati. 8 * 6 It is probable that it is this Vacaspati that is meant. 
But as against this we must remember that Vacaspati in his &raddha~ 
kalpa quotes Vardhamana Upadhyaya on sraddha. Vardhamana 
wrote his Daridaviveka while king Bhairava was reigning and his 
Gaftgakrtyaviveka for Ramabhadradeva. So Vacaspati was an elder 
contemporary of Vardhamana. 

Prasannakumar Tagore assigned 1423 A. D. as the time of the 
Vivadacintamani ( vide preface p. xxvm ). Ghose in his Hindu 
Law ( vol. II p. xiv ) says that Vacaspati wrote the Sraddhacinta- 
mani by order of queen Jaya, widow of king Bhairavadeva and

mother of Purusottamadeva,* 8 ? that Harinarayana ( i. e. Bhairava ) 
ruled from 15 13 to 1527 and that the latter was killed by Nasrat- 
shah, the Pathan king of Bengal. M. M. Chakravarti holds that 
the literary activity of Vacaspati lay between 1450 to 1480 A. D. 
Since Vacaspati mentions the Ratnakara ( of Candesvara ) and 
Rudradhara as his authorities he must be later than about 1425 A. D. 
Vacaspati's works arc quoted by Govindananda and Raghunandana. 
Therefore Vacaspati is certainly earlier than 1540 A. D. The ms. 
of the Mihadananirnaya found in Nepal is dated in 392 of the 
Laksmanasena era ( Monday of Vaisfikha, dark half, 12th tilhi i.e. 
22nd April 15 1 1 A.D.) The ms. of the Suddhinirnaya (Mitra's Notices 
vol. X, p. 58, No. 3308) was copied in sctmvat 1416, which must in 
this particular case be taken as equivalent to lake 1416 i. e. 1494-95 
A. D.., since Vacaspati could not have flourished about 1360 A. D. 
( which corresponds to Vikrama saihval 141 6 ). Hence the period 
assigned by Chakravarti for the literary activity of Vacaspati appears 
to be correct. That date is further corroborated by the fact that 
Vacaspati wrote under Bhairavendra and his son Ramabhadradeva, 
that were 4th and 5th in descent from king Bhavesa of Mithila, 
who as we saw above began to rule over Mithila in the third 
quarter of the 14th century. 

This Vacaspati who flourished in Mithila in the latter half of the 
fifteenth century is very often confounded with other authors 
bearing the same name. The great philosopher Vacaspati who was 
author of the BhamatI on the &arirakabhasya of Sankara and of several 
other commentaries on other systems of philosophy flourished in 
the first half of the 9th century as he wrote his Nyayasucinibandha 
in 898 ( most probably of the Vikrama era ).* 88 There was another 
( Candrasekhara ) Vacaspati who wrote the Smrtisarasamgraha 
( cat. of Calcutta San. College mss. vol. II, p. 181, No. 203 ) and 
flourished in the first half of the 18th century.

99. Nrsimhaprasada 

This is an encyclopaedic work on dharma&stra, no part of 
which has been yet printed. The Benares Sanskrit College has a 
complete ms. of this vast work, I could examine the whole of it. 
Besides, the Deccan College collection has two mss. of portions of 
it, viz. of the Danasara ( No. 3 5 3 of 1875-76 ) and of the Tirtha- 
sara ( No. 352 of 1875-76 ). The Danasara and Santisara are also 
noticed in Mitra's cat. of Bikaner mss. ( pp. 429-430 ) and six 
sections out of twelve are noticed in the 1. O. cat. p. 434 No. 1467. 
Unless otherwise stated the references here are to the Benares 
Sanskrit College ms. 

The Nrsirhhaprasada is divided into twelve 98 - 1 sections called 
'sura 9 onsamskara, ahnika, sraddha, kala, vyavahara, prayascitta, 
karmavipaka, vrata, dana, santi ( the averting of evil foreboded by 
natural portents and other strange occurrences ), tirtha and pratistha 
(consecration of temples, idols etc.). Each section** begins with an 
invocation of Nrsimha( the man-lion incarnation of Visnu ) after 
whom the work is named Nrsithhaprasada ( the fruit of the grace 
of Nrsiiiiha ). In the Samskarasara, after invoking Nrsimha, the 
introduction tells us that** 1 when king Rama ruled in Devagiri 
( modern Daulatabad ), Ssmavit was ruler of Delhi and that after the 
latter Nijamasaha wielded power over the world. Then after pro- 
nouncing an eulogy on Nijamasaha ( verses 10-13 ) ^ e author

speaks of himself. We^ a are told that the author was Dalapati ( or 
Daladhisa ), son of Vallabha, of the Bharadvaja-gotra and of the 
Yajnavalkiya &kha (i.e. Suklayajurveda ) and that he was the 
keeper of the imperial records of Nebajana ( ? ). There are elaborate 
colophons* 93 at the end of almost each section ( called sfira ) in 
which we are told that Dalapati was the pupil of Suryapandita, 
that he was a great exponent of the Vaisnavadharma, that he was 
the chief minister and keeper of the records of Nijamasaha, who 
was the overlord of all Yavanas ( Mahomedans ) and ruler of 
Devagiri. In some colophons he is styled Maharajadhiraja. It is 
doubtful whether Dalapati or Daladhisa was the real name of the 
author or was merely a title. It is not unlikely that Suryapandita 
said to be the guru of the author is the same as Surya, the father of 
the great Maratha saint Ekanatha, who wrote his Bhagavata at 
Benares in iake 1495 (i. e. 1573 A. D. ) and who states that he 
was born in a family of devout Vaisnavas. 

The Nrsirhhaprasada names numerous authors and works. In 
the beginning of the Samskarasara, he mentions a host of writers 
and works that he consulted. 9 ?* Besides these he mentions Some-

408 History cf LharmatiUtra 

Svara ( commentator of the Tantravartika ) and Kaladipa in the 
Samskarasara ; the Puranasara in the Ahnikasara ; Parijata and 
Vadibhayaiikara in the Vyavaharasara ; Kamika, Jnanaratnavali, 
Balarkodaya in the Danasara. 

The contents of some of the sections of the Npsimhaprasada may 
be set out here. In the Samskarasara the author treats of the 
meaning of dharma, sruti, smrti, the authoritativeness of purajjas, 
kalivarjya ( usages prohibited in the kali age ), punyahavacana, 
madhuparka, vrddhisraddha, garbhadhana, pumsavana, jatakarma, 
namakarana, upanayana, marriage and other sathskdras, the duties 
of brahmacarins, snatakas, householders, vanaprasthas and samnya- 
sins. In the Ahnikasara the author after dividing the day into 
eight parts speaks of the actions appropriate to each viz : in the first 
getting up from bed at the brahma-muhurta, sauca, brushing the 
teeth, decoration of the hair, bath etc ; in the second study ; in the 
third, looking after dependents and pursuit of one's livelihood ; in 
the fourth midday bath, brahnuiyajna, tarpana, vaisvadeva, daily 
sraddha ; in the fifth dinner and foods prescribed and forbidden; 
in the sixth and seventh reflecting over itihasa and purana ; in the 
8th decision about worldly affairs, evening samdhya etc. In the 
Kalasara ( which is incomplete in the Benares ms. ) he defines the 
nature of ktila and gives rules and decisions about months, tithis 
and such festivals as Navaratra, Janmiistami etc. In the Vyavahara- 
sara the author deals with the meaning of vyavabiira, the eighteen 
titles of law, the four-fold method of deciding dharma, the pramanas 
( means of proof ), dayavibhaga etc. In the Vratasara he speaks 
of the several principal vratas in each month, some of which are for 
both men and women, some for men only and some for women 
only. In the Danasara he dilates upon the nature of dana, its 
varieties, the various results of danas, the proper time and place for 
danas, proper recipients of dana, what things can be the subjects 
of gifts, units of gold, silver etc., the description of kunda, mandapa 
and vedi, the sixteen great danas such as tula, hiraijyagarbha, 
brahmanda, kalpapadapa etc. and three atidanas, viz. land, cows and 
learning ; gifts of images, food, ornaments, bed-stead etc. ; gifts on 
sarhkranti and eclipses etc. The Tirthasara is interesting for this 
that as the author hailed from Devagiri he speaks principally of 
tlrtbas-ti the Deccan and Southern India. In this work he speaks 



99. Nfmfhhapra^da 409 

of Setubandha, Puiidarika*** or Paundarika ( modern Pandharpur 
in the Sholapur District, it seems), Gayatirtha, eulogies of Godavari, 
Krsiia-Veoya, Narmada, Malapraharini etc. 

The Nrsimhaprasada being a work from the Deccan held the 
view that marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter was sanctioned 
by the Veda and was not to be censured." 6 It says that where 
there is ( irreconcileable ) conflict between the smrtis and puraijas 
there is an option.**? 

As the Nrsimhaprasada relies upon the Madhavlya and the 
iMadanaparijata, it is certainly later than 1400 A. D. As it is 
mentioned as an authority in the Dvaitanirnaya of Saiikarabhatta 
and in the Mayukhas of Nilakantha it must be earlier than about 
1575 A. D. If by the Dipikavivarana which it enumerates among 
its principal authorities is meant the com. of Nrsimha, son of 
Ramacandracarya, on his father's commentary of the Kalanirriaya 
( which is most probable ), then the Nrsimhaprasada must be later 
than about 1 500 A. D. Dr. Bhandarkar^ 8 says that Ramacandracarya 
lived about 1450 A. D. A ms. of the Dipikavivarana was copied in 
samvat 1604 (1548 A. D.)."9 The Benares Sanskrit College ms. ap- 
pears to have been copied for RamapanditaDharmadhikariat Benares, 
who ib said to have been the father of Nandapandita 1000 (see sec. 105 
below ). At the end of several saras either sarhvat 1568 ( 1511-12 
A. D. ) or 1569 occurs as the date. 1001 This may be said to be the

date of the actual composition of the work or of the copying of the 
ms. for Ramapandita. It seems difficult to believe that Ramapandita 
for whom the ms. was copied in 1511-12 A. D. was the father of 
the famous Nandapandita. We know that Nandapandita composed 
his Vaijayami in 1623 A. D. Ramapandita must have been a man 
of middle age before he could order the copying of a huge ms. like 
the Nrsimhaprasada. If he did this in 1511-12 A. D. his son 
could hardly have been alive 120 years later. Therefore it looks 
probable that the dates ( sathvat 1568 and 1569 ) are not the dates 
when the ms. was copied for Ramapandita, but rather the dates 
of the composition of the original work or of the copying of the ms. 
from which Ramapandita got his own ms. copied. At all events it 
is clear that the Nrsimhaprasada could not have been composed 
later than 15 12 A. D. As the author was a minister of Nijamasaha 
who ruled over Devagiri, it appears that he is referring to Ahmad 
Nizam Shah who ruled from 1490-1508 A. D. or to his son Burhan 
Nizam Shah ( 1508-1533 A. D. ), most probably the former. 1002 
It may be taken as certain that the work was composed between 
1490 and 1 5 12 A. D. 

100. Prataparudradeva 

The Sarasvativilasa was compiled by Prataparudradeva, a king 
of the Gajapati dynasty who ruled at Cuttack ( Katakanagari ) in 
Orissa. The Dayabhaga portion of this work was published with 
an English translation by Rev. Thomas Foulkes in 1881. An 
edition of the whole of the vyavahara section of the Sarasvativilasa 
has recently been published in the Mysore Government publication 
Series. Through the kindness of the Editor, Dr. Shamasastri, I was 
able to secure the printed sheets of 352 pages before publication. In 
the following reference is made to the paragraphs of Foulkes* edition 
and the pages of the Mysore edition. 

After invoking deities the work starts with the praiasti of the 
king and his family (pp. 2-1 1 ). Descent is traced to the Sun 
himself thorough Dasaratha, Rama and his sons. Kapilendra was 
the founder of the Gajapati family whose son was Puru§ottama. 
His queen was Rupambika. Prataparudradeva or Vira-Rudra-deva

was the son of Purusottama. He is spoken of as having given 
protection to Sultan (Suratrana) Husanshah who threw himself 
on his mercy. ,00 ' In the colophons 100 * the king is styled Gajapati, 
Gaudeivara ( king of Gauda ), lord of Kalubariga (modern Gulbarga) 
in the Karnataka country of nine crores (probably of revenue) 
and as the protector of Sultan Husanshah of Jamunapura. It is 
significant that the same titles are applied to Purusottama 100 * 
in hisPofavaram grant of iake 1412 ( 1490 A. D. ) and in other 
inscriptions. Prataparudradeva, while ruling his capital 1006 Kafaka- 
nagari, called together an assembly of Pandits and compiled an 
extensive digest of civil and religious law. The royal author feels 
qualms of conscience on the question of eulogising himself and his 
family but stifles them easily by saying that a poet can also be an 
appreciative critic of his own productions. I0 °7 He boasts that he 
composed the work for saving scholars the trouble of bringing 
harmony among the conflicting dicta of Vijnanayogl, Apararka, 
Bharuci and others, that there was no work that could equal his 
own and that his literary effort would make his predecessors' works 
afford illustrations of the maxim that when a certain purpose is 
served by one the existence of others is superfluous. 1008 Then it

is said that the vyavaharakanda was first taken in hand even before 
the acarakanda following the special desire of the king Vintrudra 
Gajapati. 100 * But it appears from references in the vyavaharakanda 
itself that before that part was finished the acarakarida had been 
completed. 1010 The Sarasvativilasa, being a work composed under 
the express orders of a king for the benefit of his subjects, makes the 
nearest approach to the Austinian conception of law as a command 
addressed by political superiors to political inferiors and enforced 
by a sanction. 

The principal topics dealt with in the Vyavaharakarida are : 
the hall of justice, the method of judicial procedure, the plaint, the 
reply, documents, possession, rnadana, dayavibhaga, sahasa and 
other titles of law. In the beginning of the work he sets out at 
great length the views of ancient writers on politics about the 
constitution of the manda1a 9 such as those of Parasara, Uianas, 
Visnu, Brhaspati, Visalaksa, Manu etc. He generally follows the 
views of Vijfianesvara on dayavibhaga, but here and there strongly 
criticizes him, e. g. he says that Vijfianesvara gave a very far-fetched 
interpretation 1011 of Yajfiavalkya's verse € rikthagraha rnam dapyah.' 
The Sarasvativilasa is a work of authority in Southern India on 
matters of Hindu Law, though inferior to the Mitaksara. 101 * It 
informs us that, though the Smrticandrika passed over the ordeals 
of water and poison on the ground that they had gone out of 
vogue, in Utkala the ordeal of water alone was resorted to and in 
Surasena ( Mathura ) and Magadha ( Bihar ) the ordeal of poison 
alone was administered. 1015

Besides the usual dharmasfitras and other smrtis, the principal 
authors and works named in the Sarasvativilasa are noted below. xo, 4 
The Sarasvativilasa presents in the casq of the dharmasutras, parti- 
cularly of Visiiu and Gautama, great variations from the printed 
texts of these works (vide sec. 10, p. 70 above). The Sarasvativilasa in 
scores of places gives the conflicting views of Bharuci and the 
Mitaksari (for which see under Bharuci, sec. 61). The Sarasvativilasa 
also contains valuable information about the views of such authors 
as Asahaya, Bhavadeva and Srikara whose works have not yet come 
to light. 

Burnell ( introduction to Vamsa Brahmana p. vu ) took Prata- 
parudradeva to be the king of that name who belonged to the 
Kakatiya-Ganapati dynasty of Warangal and who was carried captive 
to Delhi in 1322 A. D. But in this he was wrong. It has been 
shown above that the king connected with the composition of the 
Sarasvativilasa belonged to the Gajapati dynasty that ruled at 
Cuttack and not at Warangal. Prataparudradeva ruled from 
1497 to 1539 A. D. Therefore the Sarasvativilasa must have been 
composed in the first quarter of the 16th century. Foulkes 
thinks ( Intro, p.xx ) that the work was composed about 15 15 A.D. 
His argument is that though the commentary of MadhavlcsLrya 
was written about two hundred years before the Sarasvativilasa, the 
latter is entirely silent about it in his work and that the reason of 
this is to be sought for in the rivalry of the two dynasties of Prata- 
panulra and Krsnaraya of Vijayanagara which was set at rest by a 
marriage alliance about 1 516 A. D. Vide Prof. S. Krishnaswami 
Aiyangar's 'sources of Vijayanagar History' ( p. 116), where we are 
told that the daughter of the Orissa king married to Krsnadevaraja 
was named Jaganmohini ( according to some ) or Tukka ( according 
toothers ) and Sewell's C A forgotten empire* p. 320. Another argu- 
ment advanced by Foulkes for 1515 A. D. as the date of the work is 
that during the latter part of his reign Prataparudradeva had come

under the influence of the great Vaisnavite saint Caitanya, who made 
Purl his residence during the last years of his life and that 
the Sarasvatlvilasa has in the beginning an invocation of Siva. 
Caitanya was born in sake 1407 Falguna Full-moon ( i. e. in i486 
A. D. ) ; vide Bhandarkar's € Vaisriavism and Saivism ' (p. 83 ) 
and Caitanya is said to have gone to Puri about 15 10 A. D. 
and died in 1533 A. D. (Beames in Ind. Ant. vol. II, p. iff). 
Both these arguments are not of much weight. As a matter of 
fact in some mss. there is ah invocation of both Visnu ( Hayagrlva ) 
and Siva ; vide Descriptive Cat. of Government S. mss. at Madras 
vol. VI, p. 2426 No. 3221. The latest work of certain date that 
the Sarasvatlvilasa names is the Smrticandrika and it is rather matter 
for surprise that no work belonging to the 14th and 15th centuries 
is quoted or named by the Sarasvatlvilasa. But this circumstance 
alone is hardly of any worth in face of the positive statement in 
the work itself that it was composed by Prataparudradeva Gajapati. 
Vide JBORS. vol. V, pp. 147-148 and Ind. Ant. for 1929, pp. 28-33 
for information about the Empire of Orissa and its emperors, 
Kapilendra ( who died in 1470 A. D. ), Purusottamadeva ( 1470- 
1497 ) and Prataparudra-deva. 

There is a ms. of a work called Pratapamartartda or Praudha- 
pratapamartanda ( D. C. ms. No. 48 of 1872-73 ) which is ascribed 
to Prataparudra, ruler of Utkala, whose capital was Kataka on the 
banks of the Citrotpala. It mentions Kapilesvara Gajapati, his son 
Purusottama, father of Prataparudra. In the colophon the king is 
described as c Gajapati-Gaudesvara-navakoti-karnata-kalabaragesvara- 
rupa-narayaoa ' &c. The work is divided into five Praka&ts on 
Padarthanir^aya, Vatsaradinirupapa, Tithiniruparja, Vrataniriiaya 
(such as Navaratra &c. ), Visnubhakti. He expressly mentions as 
his authorities Hemadri, Kalpataru, Ratnakara, Mitaksara, Madhaviya, 
Anantabhatta, Smrticandrika, Apararka, Parijata, Kaladarfa, Deva- 
dasa. Here there is an express mention of Madhava which refutes 
Foulkes* theory set out above. 

ioz. Govindananda 

Govindananda wrote several works out of which four have been 
printed in the Bibliotheca Indica series, viz : the Danakaumudi, 
Suddhikaumudi, Sraddhakaumudi, Varsakriya-kaumudi. The last 
work deals with tithininpaya, vrataf on several tifbif jtll the year 



idl. QovindBtonda 415 

round, festivals like Durgotsava, Kojagara etc. All these works 
appear to have formed part of a general digest called Kriyakaumudl. 
Besides these he wrote a commentary called Arthakaumudi on the 
Suddhidipika of Srinivasa which was printed in Bengali characters, 
and also a commentary called Tattvartha-kaumudi on Sulapani's 
Prayascittaviveka ( published by Jivananda at Calcutta ). His 
works are of great utility on account of the numerous authors and 
works quoted therein. The following deserve special mention. 101 * 
He was the son of Ganapatibhatja and was styled Kavikaftkanacarya. 
From the introductory and final verses of his works it appears that 
he was a Vaisnava. His father was a resident of Bagri in the 
Midnapur District of Bengal. 

Since he quotes the Madanaparijata, the Ganga-vakyavali, Rudra- 
dhara and Vacaspati, he must be later than about 1500 A. D. He 
is quoted by Raghunandana in his Malamasatattva and Ahnika- 
tattva. So he cannot be later than 1560 A. D. His Suddhi-kau- 
mudi eiamines intercalary months 1016 from iake 1414 to iake 1457 
( i. e. from 1492 A. D. to 1535 A. D ). Therefore it appears that 
he wrote his Suddhikaumudi immediately after iake 1457 ( i. e. 
1535 A. D. ). He wrote the Sraddha-kaumudi and Varsa-kiiya- 
kaumudi after the Suddhi-kaumudi. Therefore we shall be very 
near the truth if his literary activity be placed between 1500 and 
1540 A. D.

102. Raghunandana 

Raghunandana is the last great writer of Bengal on dharmasastra. 
He compiled an encyclopedic work on the different branches of 
dharmasastra styled Smrtitattva, divided into 28 sections called 
tattvas. He cites the names of over 300 authors and works in his 
encyclopaedia, which have been collected together by M. M. 
Chakravarti ( JASB for 1915 pp. 363-375 ). His^wonderful mastery 
over smrti material and his erudition displayed in the Smfti-tattva 
earned for him the appellation smdrtabhattacarya or simply € smarta ' 
from later writers. For example, the Viramitrodaya refers to him 
in that way and so does Nilakantha in his Vyavaharamayukha. 101 ? 
His Smrtitattva was printed at Serampore in Bengali characters so 
far back as 1834-35 A. D. and it has also been published by 
Jivananda ( in two volumes ). Some tattvas have been separately 
published as e. g. the Vyavahara-tattva and the Dayatattva ( publish- 
ed at Calcutta in 1828 by the Department of Public Instruction). 
His Dayatattva was translated into English by Golapcandra Sarkar. 
In his Malamasatattva the names of his tattvas are given. 1018 Vide 
Mitra's Notices, vol. III. p. 50 No. 1081 and 1. 0. cat. p. 420 No. 1405 
for an enumeration of the tattvas and for reference to the volumes 
and pages in the Serampore edition. The tattvas are not arranged 
in the verses quoted below according to their chronological order, 
but according to the exigencies of the metre. In this work I have 
used Jivananda's edition.

lot. Raghunandana 4i7 

It is not feasible to give even brief summaries of Raghunandana's 
lattvas. Their vary names indicate the subject matter. But one of 
them, the Dayatattva, deserves special mention. It treats of partition 
made by father, partition among brothers after their father's death, 
persons not entitled to a share, property not liable to partition, 
evidence of separation, strldhana and its devolution, inheritance to 
one dying sonless etc. His Tithi-tattva contains a description in 
Sanskrit of the game called Caturafiga played on the full moon of 
Asvina by four players. 

Besides the 28 tattvas Raghunandana is said to have composed 
several other works. There is a commentary on the Dayabhaga 
attributed to him. Colebrooke suspected its genuineness, but the 
colophon of the commentary 101 * gives the same details about Raghu- 
nandana as are found in his admitted works. It is to be noticed 
that the Dayatattva of Raghunandana sets forth the same principles 
of Hindu law that are peculiar to Jimutavahana, though in matters 
of detail they disagree in a few cases. The Viramitrodaya styles the 
author of the Dayatattva a follower of Jimutavahana. loao It has 
been held by the Calcutta High Court that Raghunandana's is the 
best commentary on the Dayabhaga and that the authority of 
Raghunandana is acknowledged and respected universally in the 
Bengal School. 10 " 

Besides the above, Raghunandana wrote also Tirthatattva or 
Tuthayatravidhitattva, the Dvadasayatratattva ( on the principal festi- 
vals at Jagannathapuri, one in each month ), Tripu§karasanti-tattva, 
Gayasraddhapaddhati and Rasayatrapaddhati. His works however 
are not very much in vogue elsewhere than in Bengal. 

Raghunandana was the son of Hariharabhaftacarya and was a 
Bengal Vandyaghatfya Brahma^a. He was a pupil of Srinatha- 
acarya-cudamani, whose works are frequently quoted in the several 
tattvas ( vide Chakravarti in JASB for 1915 p. 351 n. 2 ). According 
to tradition Raghunandana and the great Vaisgavite saint Caitanya 
were pupils of the same teacher, Vasudeva Sarvabhauma, who was

were residents of that place ( Sarvadhikari's Tagore Law Lectures, 
first edition p. 403 ff.). 

Among the authors and works quoted in his encyclopaedia by 
Raghunandana those noted below deserve mention. I0 " 

Aufrecht placed Raghunandana between 1430-1612 A., D. 
Dr. Jolly ( Tagore Law Lectures p. 10 ) places him early in the 16th 
century. In I. L. R. 48 Cal. 643 ( F. B. ) at p. 695 it is said that 
Raghunandana belongs to the latter half of the 15th century. 
As Raghunandana's works are quoted and criticised by the Virami- 
trodaya(pp. 79, 531, 683, 697,703 etc.,) and by Nilakantha, 
Raghunandana is certainly earlier than 1600 A. D. As he names 
Madhavacarya, Sulapani, Rayamukuta, Rudradhara and Vacaspati, 
he is later than about 1500 A. D. If tradition is to be believed 
that he was a fellow-student of Caitanya he must have been born 
about 1490 A. D. Caitanya is said to have been born in 1485 
or i486 A. D. soz > In his Jyotistattva he mentions iake I42i io2 < 
in connection with the position of Visuva. That shows that the 
work was not composed probably very much long after that date 
( i. e. 1499-1500 A. D. ) In the same Tattva (vol. L p. 568 )

for calculating ravi-samkranti he takes Sake 1489 as the basis 
( i. e. 1567 A. D. ). So that Tattva was composed just 
about that year, A ms. of the Chandoga-sraddha-tattva was 
copied in iake 1497 ( 1575-76 A. D. ) xoa * and a ms. of the Matha- 
pratisfha-tattva was copied in iake 1498 ( i. e. 1576-77 A, D. ). ,oa6 
Therefore he must have flourished before 1575. Thus he flourished 
between 1490 and 1570 and his literary activity, which must have 
been spread over a long period if we consider the number of his 
works, lies between 1520- 1570. Vide an interesting discussion 
about his date in JASB for 191 5, pp. 354-357 by M M. Chakravarti 
who places Raghunandana between 15 10-1565 A. D. 

io3. Narayanabhatta 
• • • 

Narayanabhatta was the most famous of the celebrated family of 
the Bhaftas of Benares. For a detailed account of the family and the 
contribution of the several members thereof to dharmasastra, vide 
my Introduction to the Vyavaharamayukha (v-xvi). M. M. 
Haraprasad Sastri has brought to light a biography of this family 
written by Saftkarabhafta, ason of Narayanabhatta (Ind. Ant. for 1912 
vol. 41, pp. 7-13 )". Narayariabhatta's father Ramesvarabhatta whose 
gotra was ViSvamitra migrated from Pratisth&na ( Paithan ) in the 
Dcccan to Benares. Ramesvarabhatta was a very learned man and 
his learning drew to him students from the whole of India. Nara- 
yanabhatta was born according to Saiikarabhatta's biography in iake 
143S in the month of Caitra (i.e. about March 15 13 A. D. ). 
Narayanabhatta was the eldest of three sons, the other two being 
Sridhara and Madhava. Narayanabhatta learnt all the sastras at the 
feet of his father. Pandits all over India looked up to him as their 
leader and patron and he was an assiduous collector of Sanskrit mss. 
It is said that Narayanabhatta brought down by his holiness rain in 
a season of drought and thereby induced the Mahomedan ruler 
that had razed the temple of ViSvesvara at Benares to the ground to 
allow him to rebuild it. For his erudition and piety Narayanabhatta 
was honoured with the title ' Jagadguru ' and his family was given 
the first place of honour in the assembly of learned Brahmanas and 
at the recitations of the Vedas. It was Narayanabhatta and his 
equally worthy descendants that raised daksinatya pandits to the

position of high eminence at Benares which they still hold. Nara- 
yagabhatta wrote numerous works on dharma&stra among which 
may be mentioned the Antyesfipaddhati ( printed by Nirriayasagara 
Press ), the Tristhalisetu ( dealing with the ceremonies to be per- 
formed generally at all sacred places and particularly at Prayaga, 
,JKpLiinflXaya) and the Prayogaratna ( printed at the Nirnayasagara 
Press, 1915 A. D. ). This last contains detailed descriptions and 
rituals of the samskaras from garbhadhana to vivaha. His are 
standard works on the subjects they deal with and are used even 
now almost throughout the whole of India. He composed a com- 
mentary on the introductory verses contained in the Kalamadhava 
( vide Madras Triennial cat. vol. III. Sanskrit C. p. 41 14 No. 2852 ) 
and a commentary on portions of the Sastradipika of Parthasarathi- 
misra. He composed a work on ordeals which is referred to in the 
Vyavaharatattva of Nilakantha ( vide p. 457 of my edition and 
Bikaner cat. p. 387 No. 832 for a Divyanusthana-paddhati of Nara- 
yanabhafta ) and also paddhatis on the dedication of gardens, tanks 
etc. He exercised a profound influence over later writers directly and 
indirectly through his sons and grand-sons. 

As he was born in 1 513 A. D. and composed the commentary 
on the Vrttaratnakara in 1545 A. D., his literary activity must be 
placed between 1540 and 1570 A. D. This is further corroborated 
by the fact that his grandson Kamalakarabhatta composed the 
Nirnayasindhu, one of his earliest works, in 1612 A. D. 

There is a work on dharmasastra called Dharmapravrtti composed 
by a Narayana. Mr. K. P. Jayasval holds that this was composed 
by jagadguru Narayanabhatta ( JBORS for 1927, vol. XIII, parts 
IIMV, p. IX ). The same view is held by M. M. Haraprasad Sastri 
(Ind. Ant. for 1912 p. 7 ). But this identity is extremely doubtful. 
The benedictory verses 102 ? in the Dharmapravrtti are different from 
those of the Prayogaratna and Tristhalisetu, the method of treat- 
ment and the style are different and the colophons are also different. 
The author of the Dharmapravrtti does not mention his ancestors 
as Narayanabhatta does. Nilakantha in his Vyavaharamayukha

finds 1028 fault with the Dharmapravrtti by saying that certain 
quotations therein are unauthoritative. 

104. Todarananda 

Raja Todaramalla, the celebrated finance minister of Akbar, 
compiled an extensive encyclopaedia of civil and religious law, 
astronomy and medicine. The several parts of that encyclopaedia 
dealing with Ocara, ddna, vyavahara, iraddha, viveka, prayaicitta, 
samaya were called saukhyas. An account of some of the saukhyas 
that were available to me may be concisely given here. The Vyava- 
harasaukhya ( D. C. ms. No. 366 of 1875-76 ) begins with an invo- 
cation of &va, speaks of the paraslka emperor 1029 ( Akbar ) of Hind 
( India ) and then deals with the several topics of judicial pro- 
cedure such as the king's duty to look into disputes, ihesabhd, judge, 
meaning of the word vyavahdra, enumeration of 18 vyavaharapadas, 
time and place of vyavahara, the plaint, the reply, the agent of the 
parties ( pratinidhi ), pratyokalita, the superiority of one mode of 
proof over another, witnesses, documents, possession, inference, 
ordeals and oaths/grades of punishments and fines. The Vyavahara- 
saukhya does not dwell on the exposition of the several titles of 
law. Besides the smrti writers, it principally relies on the Kalpataru, 
the Parijata, Bhavadeva, the Mitaksara, the Ratnakara, Harihara and 
Halfiyudha. The several sections are styled harfas. 

The Vivahasaukhya ( D. C. ms. No. 868 of 1884-87) is concern- 
ed with the astrological aspects of marriage ( e. g. the proper year, 
month, day, sign, naksatra &c.,for marriage ). It names numerous 
authors and works, some of which are noted below. I0 *°

The Sriddhasaukhya ( D. C. ms. No. 257 of 1884-87 ) is an 
extensive work and deals with the usual topics such as the different 
kinds of sraddhas, the time and place for sraddha, the proper 
brahmartas, sapindikarana &c. The sections of this work also are 
divided into harjas. Besides those enumerated above the authors 
and works mentioned are noted below. I0 *' 

The Jyotihsaukhya ( D. C. ms. No. 915 of 1886-92 ) constitutes 
the Samhita branch of Indian astronomy and deals with such topics 
as the results of eclipses, the appearance of comets, the rise of Aga- 
stya, Ursa major, the signs of the Zodiac &c. It frequently refers 
to Kasyapa, Garga ( or Vrddhagarga ), Parasara, Mayuracitra, 
Varaha. The colophons state that Todaramalla was a scion of the 
Tandala ( or - na ) family and that the work was compiled by 
Nllakantha at the order of Todaramalla. 1032 This Nilakantha appears 
to be the author of the Sanjnatantra on which a commentary was 
written by his son Govinda in 1622 A. D., in which it is stated 
that Nilakanfha was honoured by Akbar and had composed the T°- 
darananda. 10 " In the Tajika-Nilakanthi of Nilakantha it is stated 
that the author composed works on the three branches of Jyotisa 
which gave delight toTodara. 1034

mann's translation of the Ain-i-Akbari, vol. I. pp. 351-35^* It is 
there stated that he was Khetri by caste, that, though it is generally 
stated that he was born at Lahore, he was really born at Laharpur 
in Oudh ( p. 620 ) and that he died at Lahore on the nth day of 
998 of the Mussulman era l0 " (i. e. 1589 A. D. ). The Marathi 
magazine c Itihasasamgraha , publishes an inscription on a stone 
found in the Draupadikugda at Benares wherein it is said that 
Todara of the Tandana family constructed thar beautiful reservoir 
in 1646 of the Vikrama era 10 ' 8 ( i.e. 1589 A. D. ). Therefore it 
follows that literary works were compiled under the patronage of 
Todarmal between 1 565-1 589 A. D. 

io5. Nandapandita 
• • 

Nandapandita was a voluminous writer on dharmasastra. An 
account of his principal works on dharmasastra is given below, parti- 
cularly because most of them are yet unpublished. 

He composed a commentary called Vidvanmanohara on the Para- 
sarasmrti. He expressly mentions therein that he follows the com- 
mentary of Madhavacarya. I0 39 This commentary is referred to in 
his Vaijayanti. I0 4° 

He also appears to have written a commentary called Pramitaksara 
Oi Pratitaksara on the Mitaksarii of Vijnanesvara. 10 ** 1 This com-

mentary was probably not completed, as only fragments are found 
with his descendants. 

Nandapandita also composed a work called Sraddhakalpalata, 
which is referred to in his Suddhicandrika 10 ** and in the Vaijayanti. 
In this work 10 *' he refers to a city called Sadharana ( probably 
modern Saharanpur ) where the Sahagila family ruled. He speaks 
of Simhamalla, Vasavana, Rupacandra, Bhupacandra and Parama- 
nanda as successive members of the dynasty and says that he was 
urged to write the work by the last of them and that he relies upon 
the Sraddhadipika of Govindapandita. 10 " At the end of the ms. 
of the Vaijayanti in the Deccan College Collection it is said that the 
Vidvanmanohara, the Smrtisindhu and the &raddhakalpalata were 
the commentaries composed by Nandapandita. 1045 But from the 
contents given in the India Office Catalogue it does not appear that 
the work was a commentary. It is divided into five stabakas and 
deals with the usual topics, viz. what is sraddha, the proper time 
and place for it, the proper brahmanas, various kinds of sraddhas 
&c. The principal authors and works named therein are given 
below. IO < 6 The suddhicandrika, a commentary on the §adaslti or 
ASaucanirnaya of Kausikaditya, is also one of the works of Nanda- 
pandita. It is referred to in his Vaijayanti 1047 . The Bhadkamkar 
collection made by Prof. Velankar contains a ms. of this work 
and it has recently been published in the Chowkhamba S. series.

loo. Nandapawfcta 425 

Another work of Nandapapdita is the Smrtisindhu, which seems 
to have been an extensive digest of smpti material. Portions of it 
have been recovered. In the Deccan College Collection 
there is a ms. of the Sarhskara-nirnayataraAga of the Smrtisindhu, 
which, according to a verse at the end, was composed by Nanda- 
pandita at the command of king Harivamsa-varman of the Mahendra 
family and son of king MaAgo. l0 ** 

It appears that he compiled a summary of the doctrines of his 
work Smrtisindhu. That summary was called Tattvamuktavali. 10 * 
It is almost certain that the fragment of the Tattvamuktavali noticed 
in the BBRAS cat. at p. 217 is part of this work. That fragment 
contains 8 verses on upakarma and three on holika with commentary 
and the verses are numbered from 557 to 564 and then 607-609. 
If the above surmise be correct, the work was a large one and con- 
tained over 610 verses. Two of the verses name Hemadri and 
Parijata. 10 * 1 

The VaijayantI or Ke&va-Vaijayanti is a famous work of his. 
It is a commentary on the Visnudharma-sQtra. Extracts from it 
have been published by Dr. Jolly in his edition of Visrui, This is 
an extensive work. The following account is taken from the ms. 
in the India Office Library ( vide cat. p. 393 No. 1342 for a 
brief description ). In this work he refers to a Brahmana dynasty 
of the Vasisfha gotra at Vijayapura ( Vijayanagara ? ) in Karnafa 
country, in which was born Kogdapanayaka, whose son was Kesa- 
vanayaljtt, whose son was Ananta alias Vavarasa, whose sons were 
Kesava and Rudra. Kesava, son of Koiidapa, seems to have gone

to Benares with his sons and grand-sons and made extensive 
gifts of all kinds. 1052 There is a hyperbolical description of his great 
gifts (mahadanas including tula, i. e. weighing against gold or silver). 
Kesavanayaka enjoined upon Nandapandita the task of composing a 
commentary on the Visnusmrti. 1 " 5 * In the colophons at the end 
of the chapters of Visnu, Koijdapanayaka is styled Maharajadhiraja 
and it is said that Nandapandita was encouraged in the task by 
Kesavanayaka alias Tammasanayaka. At the end of chapter 101, 
we are told that Kesavanayaka, Nandapandita's patron, secured mokfa 
by breathing his last on the Manikarnika in Benares. I0 s* There 
are six verses at the end one of which says that in the Kali age 
there is no one more liberal than Vavarasa (a son of Kesavanayaka) 
and no one more learned than Nandapandita. I0 *> As he wrote on 
the encouragement of Kesava, the commentary is also styled 
Kesava-Vaijayanti. Among the authors and works mentioned in 
this commentary are Devasvaml, Budhasmrti, Bhavadeva, Madha- 
vacarya, Vacaspati, Sarvajiia, Subodhini ( com. on the Mit. ), Hara- 
datta, Hemadri. In the Vaijayanti he refers to no less than six of 
his works viz : the Vidvan-manohara, the Pramitaksara, the Sraddha- 
kalpalata, the Suddhicandrika, the Dattaka-mlmariisa ( vide note 
1040 above ). But in the Dattaka-mimariisa itself he refers to his 
Kesava-Vaijayanti as already composed. I0 * 6 Therefore it follows 
that both works were probably being composed at the same time. 
The Vaijayanti is one of the leading authorities of the Benares 
School of modern Hindu Law. 10 "

106. Nandajxwpta 4S7 

NandapaijdKta, though he generally follows the Mitaksari, was 
not a slavish admirer of VijfianeSvara. He does not accept the 
explanation the Mitaksara gives of Yaj II. 17 ( saksisubhayatah etc.). 
Similarly on Vi§nu 8. 12, 22. 41, 23. 11, 27. 2 he emphatically 
says that the Mitaksara is wrong. x °s 8 He prefers the father to the 
mother as an heir( on Visnu 17. 6-7 ) and seems to have placed 
the paternal grandmother as an heir after the mother but before the 
brother (folio 10 1 b ). He explains sapinda relationship in the 
same way as the Mit. 10 " does. He says that the word € bhratarah J 
in Yaj. should be explained as standing for € brothers and sisters ' 
and that in the father's line, after the brother and brother's son, the 
brothers grandson succeeds and, on failure of the brother's grandson, 
the paternal grandfather, his son and grandson are heirs one after 
another, i. e. in each line three generations succeed and then there 
is a devolution in favour of the next higher line. This view is 
opposed to that of the Subodhini and the Smrticandrika, which 
take only the son and grandson of each paternal ancestor. Vide my 
notes to the Vyavaharamayukha for fuller details ( pp. 253-254 ). 
Nandapandita stands alone among modern nibandhakaras in having 
recognised a uterine brother 1060 ( i. e. the son of the same mother 
but of a different father ) as an heir. It is remarkable that Nanda-

pafldita preferred a person's predeceased son's widow (i. e. widowed 
daughter-in-law ) as an heir to that man's own daughter. 1061 

The Dattaka-mimarhsa is the most famous work of Nandapaodita. 
It was translated very early by Sutherland ( comprised in Stoke's 
Hindu Law Books), In the following the edition of Bharatacandra 
&iromaiii ( published in 1885 with his own commentary ) has been 
used. In this work he lays down rules as to the person who may 
adopt, when he may adopt, who can give in adoption, who may be 
adopted, the motives of adoption, the necessary ceremonies of 
adoption, the results of adoption. Among the authors and works 
quoted or referred to those mentioned below may be noted. lo6z 

From very early days of the British rule in India the Dattaka- 
mimamsa came to be regarded as the standard work on adoption. 
In Collector of Madura z/. Mootoo Ramalinga 106 * the Privy Council 
says "Again of the Dattaka-mimaihsa of Nandapandita and the Dattaka- 
candrika of Devannabhafta, two treatises on the particular subject 
of adoption, Sir William Macnaghten says that they are respected 
all over India ; but that, when they differ, the doctrine of the latter 
is adhered to in Bengal and by the southern "jurists, while the 
former is held to be the infallible guide in the provinces of Mithila 
and Benares." That this estimate is somewhat too strongly put has 
been said by the Privy Council itself in Bhagwansingh v. Bhagwan- 
singh 10 ** l to call it infallible is too strong an expression and the 
estimates of Sutherland and of West and Biihler seem nearer the 
true mark ; but it is clear that both works must be accepted as 
bearing high authority for so long a time that they have become 
embedded in the general law. ' The Privy Council further lays 
down c their Lordships cannot concur with Knox J. in saying that

their (of the Dattaka-mimarhsa and Dattaka-candrika) authority is open 
to examination, explanation, criticism, adoption or rejection like any 
scientific trfcatiseson European jurisprudence*. 106 * Even in those pans 
of the Bombay Presidency where the Vyavaharamayukha is a work 
of paramount authority, the Dattakamimariisa has on the subject of 
adoption been preferred in certain matters to the Vyavaharamayukha. 
For example, the Bombay High Court, following the Dattaka- 
mimariisa, has laid down that among the three higher castes a man 
cannot adopt his own daughter's, sister's, or mother's sister's son. 
The view of the Vyavaharamayukha, on the contrary, is that he 
can take these in adoption. The limits to which Nandapandita 
will be followed by the courts are laid down in Ramachandra v. 
Gopal i ' The authority of Nandapandita must be accepted except 
where it can be shown that he deviates from or adds to the stnrtis 
or where his version of the law is opposed to such established 
custom as the Courts recognise'. 1066 

Several views expressed in the Dattakamimariisa have been set at 
naught in the various provinces by the British Indian Courts. 
Nandapandita held that a widow could not adopt at alL Io6 7 Except 
in Mithila this view has nowhere been entertained in India and 
the Courts have held that the Law of Benares, Bengal, Madras and 
Bombay is different. Nandapandita put forward the position that 
the brother's son must be preferred for adoption over any other 
sagotra or sapiytfa. 106 * This has, however, been treated in all 
provinces as no more than a mere recommendation and that failure 
to observe it entails no legal or religious consequences whatever. 
The expression 'putracchaya ' in € putracchayavaham' occurring in 
the text of Saunaka was explained by Nandapandita to mean 
' similarity to a son born ' and he said that the similarity consist- 
ed in the possibility of being begotten by means of niyoga and the 
like. 106 ? Sutherland wrongly introduced the word € marriage * after

niyoga in his translation and some of the High Courts in India, 
following this wrong translation, evolved the rule that no one 
could be adopted whose mother the adopting father could not have 
legally married in her maiden state. I0 ?° But the Bombay High 
Court has laid down that the rule is restricted to the three specified 
cases of the daughter's son, the sister's son, and the mother's sister's 
son. 1071 From the text ( brahmanaditraye nasti bhagineyah sutalj 
kvacit ), Nandapandita evolved the curious rule that a widow 
cannot adopt to her deceased husband her own brother's son. 
But the Privy Council has refused to follow this dictum on the 
ground that the gloss of Nandapandita is an extension not based on 
the authority of any smrti and has upheld such an adoption. 10 ? 2 

About the personal history of Nandapandita we do not know 
much. •Mandlik in his Hindu Law ( lxxii, n. 3 ) gives what 
information he could gather from descendants of Nandapandita 
living in Benares. According to him the founder of the family was 
Laksmldhara who was a resident of Bidar ( now in the Nizam's 
dominions ) and who went to Benares. Nandapandita was the 
sixth in descent from him. Dr. Jolly visited at Benares Pandit 
Dhundir&ja Dharmadhikari who was 9th in descent from Nanda- 
pandita ( Tagore Law Lectures, p. 15 ) and Mandlik's information 
also was gathered from persons who were 9th in descent from 
Nandapandita. Mandlik also gives a detailed genealogical tree. We 
learn from several works of Nandapandita and their colophons that 
he was also named Vinayakapandita and was the son of Ramapandita 
of Benares who is styled Dharmadhikari. Nandapandita also i° 
described as Dharmadhikari in the Samskaranirnaya-taraftga of the 
Smrtisindhu (vide note 1049 above). It appears that Nandapandita 
was at different times patronised by rich patrons from different parts 
of India. He composed the Sraddhakalpalata for Paramananda of the 
Sahagila family of Sadharana, the Smrtisindhu for Harivamsavarman 
of the Mahendra family and the Vaijayanti for Kesavanayaka of 
Madhura.

Mandlik notes that Nandapandita is credited with the authorship 
of 13 works. Eight works of Nandaparidita have been named and 
described above. Mandlik names six of these. Besides these he is said 
to have written Navaratra-pradipa, three sections of a work named 
Harivamsavilasa (viz. danakautuka, ahnikakautuka and samskara- 
kautuka ), Balabhusa, Tirthakalpalata, Kalanirnayakautuka, Kasipra- 
kasa, Madhavananda. But we saw above (note 1050) that the Bala- 
bhusa is only a commentary on the Tattvamuktavali ( probably com- 
posed by another writer). The Kasiprakasa was certainly composed by 
Nandapandita as he is described in the India Office ms. to have been 
the son of Ramaparujita. 10 ? 3 That work was composed at the order 
of one Sarvabhatfa, who was the guru of Kfsnanayaka of Madhura. 
In Mitra's Notices two works, Jyotihsastrasamuccaya and Smarta- 
samuccaya, are described as composed by Nandapandita, son of 
Devasarman and Vrnda. ,0 74 The latter seems to have been an 
extensive work and dealt with tithinirvaya, intercalary month, 
marriage, sapipda relationship, the samskaras, daily observances, 
anlyetfi ( funeral rites ), aiauca, hiddhi, irdddha, prdyaicitta, 
dayabhdga and vyavahdra. Though the name of the father, 
Devasarman, creates suspicion in one's mind, both these works must 
be regarded as the works of Nandapandita, son of Ramapandita, as in 
the Smartasamuccaya the author refers his readers to his Dattaka- 
mimamsa for the subject of adoption. It is not unlikely that just 
as Nandapandita had the alias Vinayaka, his father Ramaparidita was 
also called Devasarman. 

Mandlik ( Hindu Law lxxii, n. 3 ) notes that on a copy of 
the Madhavananda-kavya composed by Nanda the year sathvat 1653 
(1599A. D. ) is given, probably in Nandaparidita's own hand- 
writing. The VaijayantI was one of Nandapa^dita's latest works. 
That work, we are told, was composed at KasI in Vikrama sathvat 
1679 ( Nov. 1623 ) on the Full moon of Kartika when the sun was 
in Scorpion and the moon in Taurus. xo 7* Therefore the literary

activity of Nandapandita must be placed between 1595 and 16*30 
A. D. Mandlik in his Hindu Law (p. 281) says that the 
Vaijayanti of Nandapandita is referred to in the Vyavaharamayukha 
of Nilakaitfha. I have not been able to find the reference in the 
latter work. 

106. Kamalakarabhatta 

Kamalakarabhatta was one of the foremost scions of the Bhafta 
family. He was a grandson of the famous Narayanabhatta and 
a son of Ramakj-snabhafta. He was one of three brothers, the eldest 
being Dinakara alias Divakara 10 ? 6 and the youngest was Laksmana- 
bhatta, 10 ? 7 who studied under Kamalakarabhatta. Kamalakarabhatta's 
father Ramakrsna also was a very 10 ? 8 learned man and a profound 
tnltn&rhsaka and his mother Uma immolated herself as a sail. 
Kamalakara was a man of profound erudition and composed works 
on almost every sastra. In some of his own works there are high 
eulogies of his learning and proficiency in Tarka, Nyaya, grammar, 
mimamsa (in both the schools of Kumarila and Prabhakara), Vedanta, 
Poetics, dharmasastra and Vedic sacrifices. l °w He composed more 
than twenty-two works. At the end of his Vivadatandava, it is said 
that he composed the Nirnayasindhu, a commentary on the 
Vartika( of Kumarila), a work on the mimdthsa ( sastratattva ) and 
a series of 20 other works. 1080 At the end of a ms. of the

his out of which the Nirgayasindhu is said to have been the first. 1081 
More than half of these works are concerned with topics of Dharma- 
sistra, viz. the Nirgayasindhu, the Danakamalakara, Santiratna, 
Purtakamalakara, Vratakamalakara, Prayascittaratna, Vivadataridava, 
Bahvrcahnika, Gotrapravaradarpana, Karmavipakaratna, Sudrakamala- 
kara, Sarvatirthavidhi. The &iidrakamalakara, the Vivadata^dava 
and the Nirnayasindhu are the most famous of his works on dharma- 
sastra. Brief references may be made here to some of the works 
of Kamalakara-bhatta other than the three mentioned above. It 
appears from the introductory verses of the Vratakamalakara that 
Kamalakara intended to compose a digest on dharma called 
Dharmatattva in ten paricchedas 1082 and not only carried it out 
but added some more works on dharma. It will be noticed that 
nine out of these 10 sections are enumerated under the same % names 
at the end of the Santiratna quoted above, the one not named being 
the section on Ocdra. Burnell mentions a work called Acaradipa by 
Kamalakara on daily duties and on the same page notices another work 
on ahnika by Kamalakara. 108 * It is difficult to say whether both are 
names of the same work. It is not unlikely that the acara section of 
the digest Dharmatattva is the same as the Bahvjxahnika enumerated 
at the end of the Santiratna. There is a ms. of the Bavrcahnika 
at Bikaner. 1084 It deals with daily duties commencing with rising

from one's bed at the brdhma muhurta. In this work Kamalakara- 
bhatfa refers to his own Prayascittaratna, and to the Madanaplrijata, 
Madanaratna, Madhava and Sulapani. The PGrtakamalakara' 08 * 
was an extensive work and dealt with the dedication of tanks, wells, 
trees and gardens to the public, the dedication of Asvattha tree and 
five sacred trees, dedication and laying the foundation of public 
buildings, consecration of sacred images, of Salagrama, of temples 
and flags, repairing of images, accidental breaking of temples, 
consecration of Vinayaka, pacification of planets, coronation of 
kings and emperors. In this work he mentions his own Dana- 
kamalakara. 

The Santiratna or Santikamalakara is a huge work. 1086 

It deals with various rites for propitiating Viniyaka, the nine 
planets, and for averting the consequences of portentous occurrences 
and evil omens, birth on such constellations as nmla, the observances 
known as EkadasinI, Laghurudra, Maharudra, Satacandi &c. He 
refers to his own Nirnayasindhu in this work. 

For his Gotrapravaradarpaija or Gotrapravaranirnaya, vide I. O.

This work is referred to in his Nirnayasindhu. 

In the Bombay Asiatic Society's Library there is a ms. of his 
Samskara-prayogakamalakara which appears to be over and above 
the 22 works enumerated above. 108 ' He starts with an enumeration 
of the 48 sarhskaras mentioned by Gautama, deals with the several 
samskaras of pumsavana, jatakarma, marriage &c, and with 
utsarjana and upakarma, propitiatory rites on the first appearance of 
menses, the A§taka sraddha &c. 

His Sastratattva-kautuhala or Tattva-kamalakara appears to have 
been a work of considerable interest dealing with the bearing of the 
doctrines and maxims of the Mimamsa system on ritual and dharma- 
Sastra. 1088 A ms. of it is dated sarhvat 1695 ca * tra ^ukla 4 Friday

For the Priyafcittaratna, vide Butter's report, 3, p. 108. 

I was able to secure a ms. of the Vivadatapdava from the 
Mandlik collection in the Fergusson College at Poona. That 
work closely resembles in method and matter the Vyavaharamayukha 
of Kamalakara's cousin Nilakantfia, the section on ordeals being 
almost the same in both. It treats of the following subjects: 
the sabha ; members of the sabha ; Judge, amatya ; the scribe and 
the accountant ; conflict of smrtis ; the plaint, the reply, the modes of 
proof, viz., documents, witnesses, possession; modes of punishment ; 
the principal and secondary sons ; the enumeration of the eighteen 
titles of law ; partition of heritage and detailed description of the 
other titles. Like the Vyavaharamayukha, the Vivadatandava 
quotes the Madanaratna as frequently as ( or perhaps more frequently 
than ) the Mitaksara. The other writers and works quoted are noted 
below. 108 * As it mentions several works of his own, viz. Nirnaya- 
sindhu, the Danakamalakara, the PrayaScittaratna and the Sudra- 
dharma ( i. e. Sudrakamalakara ), the Vivadatandava was one of his 
latest works. On several points he differs from his own cousin 
Nilakantha. For example, he prefers the mother to the father as an 
heir and does not give the sister a high place among the gotraja heirs 
as Nilakanfha does. The Vivadatandava has been frequently 
noticed in judicial decisions. 10 * 

The Sttdrakamalakara ( also called Sudra-dharmatattva or Sudra- 
dharmatattvaprakaSa ) has been printed in Bombay several times 
( with Marathi translation ). I used the Nirnayasagara edition of 
1895. In this work he refers to his own Danakamalakara, 
Purtakamalakara, Prayascittaratna and Nirnayasindhu. Out of 
about two hundred authors and works quoted therein, prominent 
ones are noted below. 10 * 1 This work is a standard treatise on the 
duties and religious observances of Sudras.

He first starts with the discussion that the Sadra is not authoris- 
ed to study the Vedas, but that he can listen to the recitation by 
Brahmanas of smytis and purinas and religious rites are to be 
performed for Sfldras with Puranic mantras. Then the following 
subjects are dealt with :— worship of Vi§nu and other 
deities by Sudras and the observances of vratas and fasts 
by them ; Sfldra can make gifts of works of public utility 
( puna ) ; Sfldra can adopt a son ; the conflicting views as 
to the number of sariiskaras for a Stidra, most authors holding that 
he is entitled to ten sariiskaras (without Vedic mantras), viz. 
garbhadhana, purhsavana, simanta, jatakarma, nimakarana, 
SiSuniskramaga, annapra&na, cudakarma, karnavedha and vivaha ; 
the five great daily yajiias were to be performed for the Stidra 
according to the VajasaneyaSakha; 10 * 2 SrSddhas for Sadra (to be 
performed with uncooked food ) ; actions prescribed and forbidden 
in the case of Sudras ; the details of various rites and sariiskaras of 
Sudras ; the daily duties of Sudras ; impurity on birth and death ; 
rites after death ; duties of wives and widows ; persons of mixed 
castes who have to follow the rules laid down for Sudras ; rules for 
those who are born of pratiloma connections ; about Kdyasthas. 

The Nirnayasindhu or Nirgayakamalakara is the most famous 
of Kamalakara's works. It is a monument of erudition, industry 
and lucidity. It has been judicially referred to as a work of 
authority. t0 " I have used the Nirnayasagara edition of 1905 (with 
Marathi translation ). In the whole range of nibandhakSras there is 
hardly any other writer, except perhapas Nilakantha and Mitra- 
mi£ra, who lays under contribution as many works as Kamalakara 
does. In the Nirnayasindhu about one hundred smrtis and over 
three hundred nibandhakaras are mentioned by name. In the 
introductory verses he expressly says that he pondered over the 
views of Hemadri, Madhava and other learned writers. The work 
is divided into three paricchedas. The following is a very concise

statement of the contents of this voluminous work. The principal 
subject is to give decisive opinions as to the proper times for various 
eligious acts; the various views about the year being solar, lunar, 
idereal etc., months of four kinds, lunar, solar etc., sariikranti rites 
md gifts ; intercalary month ; kfayamfisa ; about tithis, iuddha and 
)idhha{ combined with another///*/ on same day); vratas; the 
/arious vratas and festivals during the twelve months of the year ; the 
athsk&ras from garbhadhana onwards ; sapinda relationship ; consec- 
ution of images ; auspicious times (muhdrtas) for various actions 
such as sowing operations, buying horses and cattle &c. ; sraddha ; 
mpurities on birth and death; rites after death, rites for satl\ 
>aihnySsa. 

The time when Kamalakara flourished can be determined with 
gjreat accuracy. We saw above that the Ninjayasindhu was one of 
his earliest works and that it is referred to in several 
works of his. According to a verse at the end of the 
Nirnayasindhu the work was composed in 1668 of the Vikrama era 
Dn the 14th day of the dark half of the month of Magha when cyclic 
year was Raudra ( i. e. on the aoth February 1612 A. D. ). In a 
ms. noticed by M. M. Haraprasada &astri the same verse is read 
differently, so as to refer the composition to Vikrama sathvat 1678 ; 
but it is clearly a copyist's error or misreading, since the cyclic year 
Raudra cannot tally with Vikrama 1678.'°^ We saw above that 
1 ms. of the Tattvakamalakara is dated 1638 A. D. Kamalakara was 
1 voluminous writer and therefore we shall be not far wrong if his 
literary activity be assigned to the period between 1610 A. D. and 
1640 A. D. This date is corroborated in several ways. His grand- 
father Narayatjbhatta was born in 15 13 A. D. and he quotes in his 
Mirnayasindhu the Todarananda compiled in the last quarter of the 
1 6th century. Gagabhatta alias Vi$ve$varabhatta, who officiated at 
the coronation of the great Shivaji in 1674 A. D., was Kamalakara- 
bhana's nephew.

107. Nilakanthabhatta 
• • • • 

In my introduction to the Vyavaharamayfckha ( Poona, 1926 ) I 
have dealt exhaustively with the personal history of Nilakaijtha, his 
works, their contents, their position in dharmakstra literature, the 
period of Nilakanfha's literary activity and his position in modern 
Hindu Law. In the following a brief resum6 of the conclusions 
there arrived at is given. 

Nilakantha was a grandson of Narayanabhatta and a son of Saft- 
karabhatta. Saftkarabhatta was a profound rnim&thsaka and com- 
posed several works on mimariisa, viz. a com. on the Sastradipika, 
the Vidhirasayariadusana, the Mimariisabalaprakasa. He also wrote 
Dvaitanirnaya ( vide Annals of the Bhandarkar Institute, vol, III 
part 2. pp. 67-72 for an account of it ) and the Dharmaprakasa or 
Sarvadharmaprakasa. Nilakantha composed an encyclopaedia of reli- 
gious and civil law, styled Bhagavantabhaskara, in honour of his 
patron Bhagavantadeva, a Bundella chieftain of the Sefigara clan, 
that ruled at Bhareha near the confluence of the Jumna and the 
Chambal. This work is divided into 12 sections ( called vtaytikbas 
' rays ' ) on sarhskara, acara, kala ( or samaya ), sraddha, niti, vya- 
vahara, dana, utsarga, pratistha, prayascitta, suddhi, santi. These 
have been printed at Benares and some of them have been printed 
in Bombay at the Gujarati Press and by Mr. Gharpure. Besides 
this encyclopaedia he composed also a work called Vyavaharatattva, 
which is a summary of the Vyavaharamayukha, and probably a 
work styled Dattakanirnaya. The Vyavaharatattva has been for the 
first time published by me as appendix I to my edition of the 
Vyavaharamayukha. 

Nilakantha is one of the foremost nibandhakdras. Being brought 
up in a family that had made the study of mimaihsa its own for 
several generations, he is very acute in applying the maxims and 
rules of mimarhsa to dharma&stra. He stands unsurpassed by any 
mediaeval Sanskrit writer on dharmasastra in mastery over the vast 
smjti lore, in lucidity of exposition, in conciseness and ease of style, 
in clarity of vision and sobriety of judgment. Though he admired 
the learning and labours of such predecessors as Vijfiane£vara, 
Hemadri and others, he does not slavishly follow their dicta and 
expresses his dissent from them most frankly. 



107. miat<anthabhatia 4St 

His Vyavaharamayflkha is a work of paramount authority on 
matters of Hindu law according to the decisions of the Bombay High 
Court in Gujerat, the island of Bombay and northern Konkan. 10 ** 
Even in the other parts of the Bombay Presidency such as the 
Maratha country and the Ratnagiri District the Vyavaharamayukha 
occupies a very important place though it is subordinate to the 
Mitaksara. 10 * 6 The general principle on which the Bombay High 
Court acts in construing the rules laid down in the Mitaksara and 
the Vyavaharamayfikha is that the two works are to be harmonized 
with one another wherever and so far as that is reasonably pos- 
sible. 10 * 7 Though the Mitaksara is a paramount authority in the 
Maratha country and the Ratnagiri District and though it is silent 
about the sister's right as a gotrafa heir, the courts, in deference 
to the authority of the Vyavaharamayukha, have assigned to the 
sister a high place as an heir even in the Maratha country and in 
Ratnagiri. Among the other Mayukhas, the Samskaramayukha has 
been frequently relied upon by the courts. 10 * 8 The Prayascitta- 
mayukha and the Pratisthamayukha 10 ** have also been relied upon 
in the High Court. 

The period of Nilakantha's literary activity can be settled within 
very narrow limits. He was the youngest son of Sankarabhatfa. 
In the Dvaitanirnaya, Sankarabhatta quotes the views of the Todara- 
nanda which, as we saw above, must have been composed between 
1570 and 1589 A. D. So the Dvaitanirnaya could not have been 
composed before 1590 A. D. Nilakanfha, the youngest son of $an- 
karabhatta, could hardly have commenced his literary career earlier 
than Kamalakarabhatta who was the second son of &ankarabhafta's 
elder brother. Kamalakara composed his Nirnayasindhu in 1612

446 /ffftory «sf MttmmaMta 

A. D. So Nilakajithas literary activity must have commenced a 
good deal after 1610. One ms. of the Vyavaharatattva bears th« date 
sothvat 1700 ( 1644 A. D. ). This shows that the Vyavaharatattva 
was composed not later than 1644 A. D. The Vyavaharatattva 
refers to the Vyavaharamayukha as already composed. Hence we 
may say, without being far from the truth, that NilakaQtha's literary 
career falls between 16 10 and 1645 A. D. This date is confirmed 
by the fact that Nilakantha's son Saftkara wrote the Kuodabhiskara 
in 1 6 j 1 A. D. and Divakarabhatfa, the son of Nilakantha's daughter, 
composed his Acararka in 1686 A. D. It appears that there was 
probably a rivalry between the two great cousins Kamalakarabhatta 
and Nflakantha. On many matters their views diverged. Though 
the Ninjayasindhu is said to have been composed in 1668 of the 
Vikrama era, yet from the references to several works of his own 
in the Nirnayasindhu it looks as if Kamal&kara revised it from time 
to time by adding on references to his own other works and to 
those of others. The Nirnayasindhu ( HI pariccfoda, section on 
Dattakagrahana ) emphatically says that he who asserts the absence 
of ownership in one's son in spite of Vedic indications is a fool. 1100 
It is not unreasonable to suppose that this is a hit at Nilakantha who 
must have been younger than Kamalakara and who tries hard in his 
Vyavaharamayukha to establish that there is no ownership in one's 
wife and children. 

108. The Viramitrodajra of Mitramisra 

The Viramitrodaya is a vast digest composed by Mitramisra 
embracing almost all branches of dharma&stra. Excepting the Catur- 
varga-cintamajti of Hemadri, this work is probably the largest known 
on dharma&stra. But it surpasses in interest and usefulness even 
Hemadri's work since it deals with vyavaharaalso. It was divided into 
sections called prdkaias. So far the prakaias on vyavat&ra, paribhasa, 
samskara, rajaniti, ahnika, puja, tirtha and laksapa have been pub- 
lished, the first by Jivananda ( Calcutta 1875 ) and the rest in the 
Chowkhamba Sanskrit series. The text of the dayabhaga portion 
of the Vyavaharapraka&t was also published by Golapchandra Sarkar 
Sastri with an English translation ( Calcutta 1879 ). It appears that 






103. Th* Vhxmitrcdaya qf Mitrami&ra 441 

Mitrami&a wrote on praya&itta also." 01 But that work has not yet 
been met with. The very names of the sections of the Viramitrodaya 
convey an idea of the subjects dealt with in them. The Laksaria- 
praka£a deals with the auspicious signs of men, women, the several 
parts of human body, elephants, horses, thrones, swords, bows and 
with the characteristics and qualities of the queen, the ministers, 
the astrologer, physician, doorkeeper, description of salagrama, Siva- 
lifiga, rudraksa beads etc. In the ahnikaprakaia he dilates upon 
the daily duties beginning with one's rising from bed on brahma- 
muhurta, £auca, acamana and ending with going to bed. The Vya- 
vaharapraka£a is probably the largest nibandha on vyavahara. This 
is divided into four parts. The first part deals with the meaning 
of vyavahara, the constitution of the sabba ( court of justice ), the 
appointment of judges, conflict of dharmasastra and arthasastra, 
assessors, the various grades of courts, the procedure about plaints 
and defendant's replies and their faults; the burden of proof and the 
means of proof. The second gives a detailed exposition of the 
means of proof, viz. witnesses, documents, possession and ordeals. 
The third treats of the eighteen titles of law including dayavibhaga 
and the fourth very briefly speaks of those matters which were to be 
started suo tnotu by the king and not by a private individual. The 
dayavibhaga portion of the Vyavaharaprakasa occupies a little more 
than one-fourtth of the whole of the work. 

In the Tirthaprakaia he deals with the nature of ttrthas, the utility 
thereof for men, the persons entitled to undertake pilgrimage, the 
proper times for pilgrimage, the ceremonial acts to be performed at 
ttrthas such as shaving, fasts, bathing, gifts, the description of the several 
var$as and dvipas and of sacred rivers like the Ganges, Narmada, 
sacred places like Gaya, Prabhasa, Badri, Pu§kara and Purl. 

In the Pujapraka£a he speaks of the definition of paja, persons 
entitled to perform paja (worship of gods), the rewards of paja, proper 
times and places for paja^ Salagrama, the proper articles and clothes 
for the worship of idols, proper flowers, fragrant substances, naivedya, 
the detailed method of worshiping Vis^u, Siva, the Sun, Durga, 
Brahma etc. In the printed edition there are no introductory 
verses here.

In the Samskara-prakasa the author enumerates the samskiras 
and describes in detail garbhadhana, pumsavana, anavalobhana, 
simantonnayana, jatakarma, namakarapa, sisuniskramaija, annapra- 
fcma, cfida, upanayana, vivaha etc, the duties of brahmacarins, gotras, 
pravaras and sdpiydya, all astrological matters in connection with 
marriage, pindapitryajna, sarpabali, asjakasraddha, sulagava. 

The Rajanitiprakasa treats of the definition of rdjan, the proper 
time and procedure of coronation, the daily routine for kings, the 
qualifications of ministers, commander-in-chief and the dependents 
of the king, forts, capital, palaces, the four expedients of sdtna etc., 
the six gmjas, auspicious and evil signs, marching for battle, 
Kaumudi and Indradhvaja festivals etc. 

In all his works Mitramisra mentions hundreds of authors and 
works. The portion on vyavahara is full of long-drawn controver- 
sies in which he refutes the views of numerous predecessors. The 
Viramitrodaya enters into polemics far more frequently than Nila- 
kanfha. He generally upholds the Mitaksara of Vijnanesvara against 
all its critics, particularly the writers of the Bengal school. But he 
does not slavishly admire the Mitaksara in every thing. Now and 
then he rebukes even Vijnanesvara. For example, he does not 
approve of what the Mitaksara says about the son called Kdnina. 1101 
He finds fault with Vijnanesvara's explanation of the verse * anyoda- 
ryastu ' as extremely forced and far-fetched and as simply exhibit- 
ing the author's pedantry. 110 * Out of the host of works and writers 
that he names in the vyavahara section the important ones are 
noted below." 04

i0lft Tie Viramitrodaya cf MUramitra 448 

The Viramitrodaya is a work of high authority in the Benares 
School of Hindu Law. The Privy Council has laid down that € the 
Viramitrodaya is properly receivable as an exposition of what may 
have been left doubtful by the Mitaksara and declaratory of the law 
of the Benares school. ' "°* Similarly it has been said by the same 
high tribunal that the Viramitrodaya may be referred to even in 
Bengal where the Dayabhaga is silent." 06 But where the text of 
the Mitak§ara on any point is quite clear, the gloss of the Virami- 
trodaya on the text of any sage which is in conflict with the rule 
laid down in the former cannot be referred to for the purpose of 
casting a doubt on the clear rule of the Mitaksara. 110 ? The Viramitro- 
daya is inferior to the Vyavaharamayukha in Western India 1108 and 
its doctrines are not followed in those provinces when in conflict 
with those of the other two works. Their Lordships of the Privy 
Council say in Vedachala v. Subramania 110 * 'although the Smrti- 
candrika in the Southern Presidency is regarded as the most autho- 
ritative commentary on Vijfianesvara's work, the Viramitrodaya 
holds, as in Western India, a high position. It supplements many 
gaps and omissions in the earlier commentaries and illustrates and 
elucidates with logical preciseness the meaning of doubtful pres- 
criptions. ' 

There is a ms. of the Danaprakasa in the Deccan College 
(No. 305 of 1 884-1 887 ). It is an extensive work and contains 
the usual topics about gifts. 

Besides the digest called Viramitrodaya Mitramisra composed a 
commentary on the smrti of Yajiiavalkya. There is a ms. in the 
Deccan College ( No. 58 of A 1883-84) which contains portions 
( with gaps ) of the commentary on the three kandas ( acara, vya- 
vahara, prayakitta ). From the portion available it appears that

the commentary was of considerable extent, though not as volu- 
minous and as full of polemics as his digest. The acara portion had 
at least 446 folios ( with 6 lines on each side and 30 letters in each 
line ), the vyavahara at least 257 and prayascitta a great many more 
than 153. Besides the works noted above he quotes the Karma- 
pradipa and the Smjtisara. In this work he does not quite approve 
of the reasons for the preference shown to the mother over the father 
as an heir by the Mitaksara, viz. the occurrence of the word c mata* 
as the first word when the word ' pitarau ' is dissolved and the 
greater propinquity of the mother as compared with the father, 
since the latter can beget sons from another wife. 1110 The com- 
mentary gives three varieties ofddsf. lltl Vide I. O. cat. p. 371

In the introductions to the several sections of his digest and also 
in the colophons therein MitramiSra furnishes considerable infor- 
mation about himself, his family and the family of his patron. 
Mitramisra was the son of Para£uramapandita and grandson of 
Haihsapantjita. Hamsapandita seems to have been a native of 
Gopacala ( Gwalior ) and was endowed with the rare combination 
of wealth and learning. One CarideSvara of Ka& was the guru

tions of his own learning and naively tells his readers that they 
need study only his work and may neglect all other nibandhas. 
Mitramisra was commanded by Virasimha to compose his great 
digest. 1 "* The introduction to the Ahnikaprakasa starts with king 
Medinimalla who was a scion of the Kasiraja family. His son was 
Arjunadeva who became ruler of Bundelkhand. His son was Mala- 
khana, whose son was Prataparudra ( founder of the capital Orccha). 
His son was Madhukarasaha, whose son was Virasimha. Virasimha's 
son was 1 "* Jujhara who is described as € young '(yuva in verse 23). 
His son was Vikramarka whose son was Narasimhadeva. There is 
no such introduction to the printed Pujaprakasa and Narasimhadeva 
is not mentioned in the introductions to the other prakasas. From 
the article of Mr. Lala Sitaram in the Calcutta Review ( May and 
July 1924 ) further information can be gathered about Birsinghdeo 
( i. e. Virasimhadeva ). In the article it is shown how and under 
what circumstances Virasimha killed Abul Fazal, the friend of 
Emperor Akbar and a great literary genius. We are told there that 
there is a work called Virasirhhadeva-carita composed in Vikrama 
year 1664 ( 1607-8 A. D. ) by Kesavadasa, author of Kavipriya and 
Rasikapriya. Virasimha was 7th out of the eight sons of Madhu-

karasaha. Not only was he a soldier, but he was a great builder. 
He built the palace forts of Orcchha and Datia, the temple of Kesa- 
vadeva at Mathura, several lakes called Birasagara, Simhasagara and 
Deosagara ( after the three parts of his own name ). He is said to 
have ruled at Orchha from 1605 to 1627 A. D. From the intro- 
duction to IIIS the commentary on Yajnavalkya it appears that Vira- 
simha commanded Mitramisra to write it and that a learned man 
Sadananda, the ornament of Tirabhukti ( Tirhoot ), was also con- 
nected with its composition. It will be seen that the title Virami- 
trodaya very cleverly suggests that Mitramisra wrote it under the 
patronage of Virasimhadeva. The title may mean ' the rise of 
Vira and Mitra ' or c the rise of the friend of Vira ' or ( the rise of 
the sun, viz. Vira \ 

The time when Mitramisra flourished can be easily settled on 
account of his relations with Virasimhadeva. In his Ahnikaprakasa 
he mentions the great-grand-son of Vlrasimha. Therefore that sec- 
tion must have been written when Vlrasimha was advanced in age. 
Vlrasimha ruled at Orchha from 1605 to 1627. Hence the literary 
activity of Mitramisra must be placed in the first quarter of the 17th 
century. This date agrees with the fact that he names Vacaspati 
and Raghunandana. We thus see that Mitramisra was almost a 
contemporary of Kamalakarabhatta and Nilakantfia. The two latter 
do not refer to him nor does Mitramisra name them. 

In the Vyafigyartha-kaumudi of Anania^'ama" 16 of Punya- 
stambha ( Puntambe ) on the Godavarl, a commentary on the Rasa- 
man jari of Bhanudatta, the author gives a pedigree of his pairon. 
He describes the Kasiraja family at Benares, in which was born 
Prataparudra whose son was Madhukarasaha, whose son was Vira- 
simhadeva. Ananta wrote the commentary for Candrabhanu, a son 
of Virasimhadeva, in 1635 A. D. This corroborates the dates above 
given by Mr. Lala Sitaram. Therefore it is almost beyond doubt 
that the literary activity of Mitra-misra lies between 16 10 and 
1640 A. D.

109. Anantadeva 

Anantadeva compiled a vast digest called Smrtikaustubha divid- 
ed into several sections on samskara, acara, rajadharma, dana, ut- 
sarga, prati$tha, tithi and samvatsara. The section on samskaras and 
that on rajadharma are also called Samskara-kaustubha and Raja- 
dharma-kaustubha. Each Kaustubha is subdivided into parts called 
didhiti. The Samskara-kaustubha is the most popular and most 
well-known work of his. It has been printed several times, the 
best editions being that of the Nirnayasagara Press ( 19 13 ) and that 
issued at Baroda ( 19 14 ) under the patronage of H. H. the Maha- 
raja Gaikwad ( with a Marathi translation by Sastri Venkatacarya 
Upadhyaya ). I have used the latter. The Samskara-kaustubha is 
recognised as an authoritative work by the highest court for 
India. 1 "7 The following is a very brief summary of the contents :- 

The sixteen samskaras, the first being garbhadhana, the astro- 
logical aspects of the first appearance of menses and the various 
propitiatory rites therefor ; the proper times for garbhadhana and 
the several rites connected therewith ; punyahavacana, nSndisraddha, 
matrkapujana ; narayanabali and nagabali ; pancagavya, krechra and 
other prayascittas ; candrayanavrata ; adoption, who is entitled to 
adopt, who can be adopted, rites of adoption, gotra and sapindya 
of the adopted son, mourning to be observed by the adopted, 
succession of the adopted ; putrakamesfi ; pumsavana ; anavalo- 
bhana ; simantonnayana ; rites on the birth of a child or son ; impu- 
rity on birth ; propitiatory rites for evil aspects at birth; namakaraiia; 
niskramaija ; annaprasana ; piercing the ear ; celebration of birth 
day ; caula ; upanayana, proper times for it, the necessary materials 
for it, the gdyatri, the vows of abrahmacarin; samavartana; marriage, 
sapiridya for it, gotras and pravaras, proper times for marriage, 
forms of marriage, vag-niscaya, simantapujana, madhuparka, kanya- 
dana, vivahahoma, saptapadi, homa on the entrance of the married 
couple etc. 

The portion of the Samskara-kaustubha on the subject of adop- 
tion is frequently cited separately as Dattakadidhiti and is so entered 
in the catalogues of mss. It is a treatise of great importance and 
deserves to be studied along with the Dattakamimamsa, the Vyava-

448 Hilary cf DharmatiUra 

haramayukha and other similar works. The more important of 
his views are set out below. Like the Dattakamimariisa he recom- 
mends that the nephew is the most suitable for adoption, then one 
may select any sagotra, sapinda, then an asagotra saphjda, then 
a sdgotra but asapinda, then any one of the same caste though 
not sagotra, but a daughter's or sister's son cannot be adopted 
nor can a brother, a paternal or maternal uncle be adopted. A 
Sudra may adopt a daughter's or sister's son. The person to be 
adopted must not be an only son or the eldest. A wife can adopt 
with the consent of her husband and a widow does not require the 
express permission of her husband. The boy to be adopted may 
be below five or above five and may be taken before or after the 
cofa ceremony is performed in the natural family. Anantadeva 
refers to the 1118 view of some that the verses of the Kalikapurina 
on this subject are not found in several mss. and so are unauthori- 
tative and tells us that others hold that the whole passage refers to 
the adoption of an asagotra boy. Anantadeva himself holds, like 
the Vyavaharamayukha, that even an asagotra boy may be adopted 
after his upanayana is performed in the natural family. When the 
ceremony of caula and the rest are performed in the family of the 
adopter, the adopted boy belongs to the gotra of the adopter, but 
where the upanayana alone is performed in the adoptive family or 
the adoption is made after upanayana the boy belongs to both gotras. 
But this holds good only as regards obeisance, Sraddha etc. while 
for maniage every adopted boy has to avoid the gotra and pravara 
of both families. If a natural son be born to the adopter after he 
takes a boy in adoption, the adopted boy becomes an equal sharer 
with the aurasa, if all the samskaras up to upanayana are performed 
by the adoptive father for the adopted boy, or he takes only a

fourth share if only some of the sa±skaras ending with npanayana 
aie performed by the adopter and he gets no inheritance but only 
provision for marriage if he was adopted after upanayana is perform- 
ed in the natural family. Anantadeva, disagreeing with Nilakantha, 
liolds that a girl may be adopted." 1 * 

Like the Nirpayasindhu and the Mayukhas of Nilakantha, Anan- 
tadeva in the Saihskarakaustubha and elsewhere names several 
hundred authors and works. It is not necessary to set out the 
whole lot. His authorities are practically the same as those of the 
former. He principally relies among nibandhas upon the Mitaksara, 
Apararka, Hemadri, Madhava, Madanaratna, Madanaparijata. The 
Smrtikaustubha was divided into several dldhitis ( rays, parts ). In 
the Smrtikaustubha published by the Nirnayasagara Press it is 
expressly stated that the tithidldhiti has been already 1110 expounded. 
At the end also it is said that the work is only the com- 
plete abdadldhiti ( i. e. portion dealing with saihvatsaras of five 
kinds ). The year is said to be of five kinds, candra, saura, savana, 
barhaspatya and nak§atra. The printed work treats of the several 
rites, observances, festivals and vratas on the important tithis of the 
twelve months of the candra year with the intercalary month and 
observances thereof, the rites proper to saura year and samkrantis 
( the sun's passage from one sign into another ), the rites of the 
savana year, the rules about rites when Jupiter is in the sign of Leo, 
the rites of the naksatra year, the actions forbidden and allowed in 
Kali age according to Anantadeva and discussion of the views of 
Hemadri, Madhava and the Madanaparijata thereon. 

The Rajadharmakaustubha 1121 was divided into several parts 
( didhitis ). The first deals with the characteristics and defects of

kings, the qualities and characteristics of queens, ministers, purohita, 
astrologer, the rites to be performed at coronation, duties to be 
observed after coronation. Another portion of the same work 
deals with vyavahara viz., the sabha, the judge, the plaint, the reply, 
means of proof, ordeals etc. 

It is unnecessary to go into details about the other treatises on 
prayascitta, pratistha" 22 &c. Anantadeva also wrote several 
prayogas such as the Agnihotraprayoga, Caturm&syaprayoga. In 
the Bhadkamkar collection there is a ms. of a drama called Kr§na- 
bhakti-candrika composed by Anantadeva in which the characters 
are a Saiva, Vaisriava, Mimariisaka, Tarijika &c. 

In the Smrtikaustubha ( Nirpayasagara edition of 1909 ) 
Anantadeva gives a pedigree 1 12 * of his patron's family. The family 
claimed descent from the moon. Whether the first three kings 
mentioned in the Smrtikaustubha were related as father and son is 
doubtful. Laksmanacandra is said to have been the son of Rudra- 
candra and it was he who conquered several chiefs wielding sway 
over the Himalayan territories. 112 * Trimallacandra, the successor

(and probably the son ) of Laksmanacandra, is praised for his con*

command of Baz Bahadurcandra and for pleasing him that Ananta- 
deva compiled his Smrtikaustubha. 1 " 6 At the end Anantadeva tells 
us that Baz Bahadurcandra conquered several mountain forts in the 
Himalayas. 11 *? After giving a pedigree of his patrons' family 
Anantadeva gives some information about himself. He was a. 
descendant of the great Maratha saint Ekanatha whom he 
describes as endowed with Vedic sacrifices and as a devotee 
of Krsria. 1128 That this Ekanatha is the same as the great 
Maratha saint is vouchsafed by Kasinatha, author of Dharma- 
sindhu, in another work of his, 112 * Anantadeva was the great-great-' 
grand-son of Ekanatha and he was the grandson of Ananta and son- 
of Apadeva, the author of the Mlmaihsanyayaprakasa alias Apadevi-.

SHimiihsa lore seems to have been a hereditary . endowment in the 
family as in the case of the Bhaftas of Benares. In all his works, 
particularly in the Samskarakaustubha, Anantadeva applies at every 
step the maxims and doctrines of the Ptirvamimamsa for the decision 
of doubtful points of Dharmasastra. Anantadeva had a. younger 
brother Jivadeva whose Gotrapravaranirnaya he draws upon in the 
Samskarakaustubha while dealing with sapindya for marriage."* 
Bhandarkar notices an Asaucaninjaya of Jivadeva in which the 
Nirgayasindhu is cited as an authority. 1 **« 

- West and Biihler in their digest 11 * 3 thought that Anantadeva 
flourished about the same time as the author of the Nirgayasindhu. 
But this requires some correction. Baz Bahadur, the patron ot 
Anantadeva, seems to have been a scion of the Candra ( or Chand ) 
family and ruled over Almora and Nainital from 1638 to 1678 A. D. 
It is said in the Imperial Gazetteer 11 ** that the first of the Chandra- 
rajas was Somachand who hailed from Jhusi near Allahabad and 
came to the Himalayan regions in the 10th century and that in 1563 
the capital was transferred to Almora by Kalyancand, whose son 
Rudracandra was a contemporary of Akbar and made his obeisance 
to the latter in 1587 A. D. at Lahore. The Smrtikaustubha does 
mention the ancestors Kalyanacandra and Rudracandra of Baz 
Bahadur. Between Baz Bahadur and Rudracandra there are three 
names. Supposing that they are the three direct ascendants of Baz 
Bahadur and allowing a period of 25 years for each after Rudra- 
candra's known date of 1587 A. D., we get the year 1662 A. D. 
for Baz Bahadur. We are told in the Gazetteer that in 1672 Baz 
Bahadur introduced a poll tax, the proceeds of which he remitted 
to Delhi as tribute. Therefore Anantadeva must have been patro- 
nised by Baz Bahadur between 1645 and 1675 A. D. A greater 
approximation can be made in another way. The saint Ekanatha 
finished his Marathi Bhflgavata at Benares in sake 1495 and 1630 
of the Vikrama era on Kartika full-moon day ( i. e. 9th November

1573 ) as he himself tells us.* 1 " Anantadeva was the fourth in 
descent from him ( exclusive of Ekanatha). Counting 25 years for 
each of the four generations, Anantadeva should have been a 
grown up man in 1673 A. D. There are controversies about the 
dates of the birth and death of Ekanatha, the commonly accepted dates 
being Sake 1450-1521 (b. 1528-d. 1600 A. D.)." 3$ The date of his 
death is iake 1521 Falguna dark half 6th day (25th February 1600 ). 
Others give 1 548-1 599 A.D. as the dates. Whichever date is correct, 
the literary activity of Anantadeva must be assigned to the third 
quarter of the 17th century. This date is confirmed by the fact 
that in the Asaucanirnaya of Jivadeva, younger brother of Ananta- 
deva, the Nirnayasindhu composed in 1611--12 A. D. is cited as an 
authority.

The learning of Nagojibhatta was of an encyclopaedic character. 
Though his special forte was Vyakarana ( grammar ) lie wrote 
standard works also on poetics, dharmaiastra, yoga and other sastras.

he composed several works, viz. Acarendusekhara, Asaucanirriaya,

Nagojibhatta was the son of Sivabhatta and Sati and was a 
Maharasjra Brahmana surnamed Kala ( Kale ). At the beginning 
and end of several works of his ( such as the Rasagartgadhara-mar- 
maprakaia, the Maiijusa) he tells us that he was patronised by Rama 
of the Bisena family, 11 * 6 the ruler of a city named Sr^gavera ( which 
seems to be on the Ganges above Allahabad ). He was the pupil of 
Haridiksita,"" son of Viresvara and pupil of Ramasrama and grand- 
son of the great grammarian Bhattoji-diksita. 11 * 8 Tradition says 
that he composed the grammatical work Sabdaratna and ascribed it 
to his teacher Haridiksita ingratitude. In the 11 ** commentary on 
the Praudhamanorama Haridiksita refers to the Sabdaratna as his 
own work and to the Sabdendufekhara as that of his pupil. 

Bhattojidiksita was a pupil of the Mimariisaka Saftkarabhatta and 
of Sesa £rikr§ga and almost a contemporary of Jagnnathapapdita. 
Bhattoji's pupil Nilakantha Sukla wrote a work in sarhvat 1663 
( Dr. Belvalkar in € Systems of Sanskrit Grammar ', p. 47 ). There- 
fore he flourished in the first half of the 17th century. Nagojibhatta 
was a pupil of Bhattoji's grandson. Therefore Nagojibhatta must 
have flourished towards the end of the 17th century and the first

Svimi makes Bhattoji a pupil of &esa VlreSvara and not of &esa Kr§oa. 
But the passage of the Manoramakucamardana, if properly interpret- 
ed, makes it clear that Bhattoji was the pupil of §e§a Kr§pa and not 
of VireSvara. 1141 A ms. of Nagojibhafta's commentary on the Rasa- 
maiijari is dated sathvat 1769, Magha 7th bright half, Wednesday, 
i. e. 21st January 1713 A. D. ( vide I. O. cat- vol. Ill p. 365 ). It 
is not unlikely that Nagojibhafta first composed his commentaries 
on the comparatively easy sastra of poetics and that he then worked 
upon Dharma&stra and Vyakarana. The edition of the Rasaganga- 
dharain the Kavyamala series says that there is a tradition that Nagoji 
was invited by king Savai Jaising of Jaipur to a horse-sacrifice in 17 14 
A. D., but that Nagoji declined on the ground of Kfetra-sathnydsa* 
Therefore his literary activity must be placed between 1700 and 
1750 A. D. Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Sistri says ( Ind. Ant. 
vol.41 p. 12 ) that Nagoji died about 1775. But r ^ s appears 
rather improbable. If one of his works was copied in 17 13 A. D. 
he could hardly have lived up to 1775, unless he was about 100 
years old at that time.

independent work. The acira portion has been published by 
Mr. J. R. Gharpure. The vyavahara portion of the Balambhattl 
was published by Mr. S. S. Setlur, Advocate, Bombay in 1911 and 
by Mr. J. R. Gharpure ( 19 14 ). This portion of the commentary 
explains the Mitak§ari word by word and also engages in lengthy 
discussions on important topics. The portion of the commentary 
on the prayascitta section has not yet been published ; but Mr. 
Govinda Das who examined it ( vide Mr. Gharpure's edition of the 
icara portion, p. 27 at end ) reports that it is meagre as compared 
with the preceding sections. In the following Mr. Gharpure's 
edition has been used. 

In the Balambhatti the author quotes by name a host of writers 
and works. As the Balambhatti is almost the latest work on Dharma- 
sastra worth special mention in this work, no useful chronological 
purpose will be served by giving the names of all such writers and 
works. It may however be stated that he names the Nin.iayasindhu, 
the Viramitrodaya, the Mayukhas of Nilakaptha, the Samskara- 
kaustubha, Siddhesvarabhafta the nephew of Nilakanfha, Khapdadcva 
the author of Bhaftadipika on the Mimamsasutra, the Kayastha- 
dharmapradipa of Gagabhatta and the author's father's commentary 
thereon. 

Of the Balambhatti ascribed to Laksmidevi/ West and Buhler 
say * she generally advocates latitudinarian views and gives the 
widest interpretation possible to every term ol Yajnavalkya. Her 
opinions are held in comparatively small esteem and are hardly ever 
brought forward by the sdstris, if unsupported by other autho- 
rities \"4* For example, in the Balambhattf the word c bhraiarah ', 
occurring in Yajiiavalkya's verses laying down the order of 
succession to a man dying without male issue, is 
interpreted as including sisters and the author says that sisters 
succeed immediately after brothers." 4 ' This dictum of Balambhatta 
taken along with the words of the Vyavaharamayukha seems to 
have influenced their Lordships of the Privy Council in Vinayak 
v. Laksbniibai on the question of the rights of the sister as an

heir. "44 In Sakharam v. Sitabai 11 " Sir Michael Westropp C. J, 
went so far as to say on the construction of the term € brethren ' in 
the Mitaksara as including sisters, which construction was adopted 
in that case (in Vinayak v. Lakshmibai) both by the Supreme Court 
and the Privy Council, "we must treat the Mitaksara also as pre- 
ferring sisters to half brothers, whom it brings in after brothers. " 
But this was a mere obiter dictum, since the case in which these 
observations were made was governed by the law of the Vyavahara- 
mayukha which expressly prefers full sisters to half brothers. It 
has been laid down in several cases in Bombay "4* that Balambhatta's 
doctrine that the word c brothers ' includes c sisters ' has not been 
accepted in that Presidency and that Sir Michael Westropp was 
under a misapprehension as to the exact drift of the Balambhattl 
which nowhere says that the term c brothers ' excludes half brothers 
and which does not bring in the full sister before the half brother, 
but expressly says that the full brother inherits first, then the half 
brother and then comes the sister. The Balambhattl not only 
brings in the sisters after full and half brothers, but places the sons 
and daughters of sisters after the sons and daughters of brother's, 
full or half. This is in direct conflict with the order of succession 
expressly mentioned by the Mitaksara and the Bombay High Court 
has refused to give -the sister's son the place which the Balambhattl 
assigns to him and treats him as a mere bandhu. 11 ^ The Balam- 
bhattl is regarded as of little authority in the interpretation of the 
Mitaksara in the Bombay Presidency and its interpretations cannot 
be accepted without due caution and examination. 11 * 8 Even in the 
Benares ,x 49 School where the Balambhattl has been accepted as one 
of the leading authorities, the authority of Balambhafta has been 
held to be inferior to that of Nandapandita in matters of adoption, it 
being held that a widow cannot adopt in the Benares School 
without express authority from her husband ( while Balambhafta 
holds that she can adopt without such authority ). Similarly it has

been held that the Balambhafti cannot prevail over the views of the 
. Viramitrodaya and that a daughter-in-law is not in the line of heirs 
at all though the Balambhatti says that she is so."? 

The author of the Balambhatti is somewhat of an enigma. 
Such women as Sila, Vijja, Avanti-sundari have been worshippers 
at the shrine of the Muse of Poetry. A lady has been associated 
with the composition of a work on Mathematics, viz. the Lilavatl. 
Inspiration for several works on Dharmasasjra was, we know, deriv- 
ed from queens and princesses, as in the case of the Vivadacandra 
compiled by Queen Laksmldevi through Misarumisra, the Danava- 
kyavali compiled by MahadevI Dhiramati of Mithila through Vidya- 
pati, the Dvaitanirnaya composed by Vacaspati at the bidding of 
queen Jaya, wife of king Bhairavendra. It gives one great pleasure 
to contemplate that at least one work on Dharmasastra, the Balam- 
bhatti, is claimed by a lady as her own. But this pleasure receives 
a rude shock if the question of the authorship of the Balambhatti is 
dispassionately considered. The introductory verses no doubt 
start by saying that Laksmi, the wife of Vaidyanatha Payagunda, 
and the daughter of Mahadeva of the Mudgala gotra and surnamed 
Kherada, composed the work, her maiden name being Uma."^ 
The colophon at the end of the acara portion says that the work 
was composed by Laksmi, the daughter of Mahadeva and Uma, the 
wife of Vaidyanatha Payagunda and the mother of Balakrsria. 115 * 
At the end of the vyavahara section in the printed editions we 
have the words f mother of Lalakrsna ' but this is obviously a mis- 
reading of the mss. or a mistake of the copyists. The pretence that 
the work was composed by a lady is made extremely plausible by

the frantic efforts made in it for the rights of women in matters of 
inheritance. But this pretence is not kept up in the body of the 
work at all. In several places the author of the Balambhafti refers 
to the Manjusa and other works of his guru and to works of his 
father. "» We know that Vaidyanatha Payagunda was a pupil of 
Nftgojibhatta," 54 who composed several Manjtisas (on grammar ) 
and a work on prayascitta. Therefore it follows either that the 
Balambhafti was composed by Vaidyanatha himself and ascribed to 
his wife or that the work was composed by Balakrsna alias Balam- 
bhatta, son of Vaidyanatha, and was ascribed to his mother. Nago- 
jibhatta who certainly attained a very advanced age was the guru of 
Vaidyanatha as well as of the latter's son Balakrsna. That Balakrsna 
or Balambhatta Payagunda was a learned man like his father 
Vaidyanatha follows from several circumstances. He wrote a work 
called Upakrtitattva. 11 * 5 Gopala alias Manudeva, in his commen- 
tary called Laghubhusanakanti on the VaiyakaranabhGsanasara, 
styles Balambhatta Payagunda his guru. 11 * 6 Looking to the colo- 
phons where Laksmi is referred to as the mother of Balakrsna and 
to the fact that the work is known as Balambhatp, we must con- 
clude that it was composed by Balambhatta and not by his father 
Vaidyanatha. What motive impelled Balambhatta to publish the 
work in the name of his mother it is difficult to say. Tradition

says that he did so to console LaksmldevI in her bereavement on 
the death of a child. Vaidyanatha composed several commentaries 
on grammatical works such as on the Mahabhasyapradipoddyota of 
Nagojibhatta, on the Paribhasendusekhara ( com. called KaSika and 
Gada ), on the Vaiyakarana-siddhantamanjusa ( com. called Kali ), 
on the Laghusabdendusekhara ( com. Cidasthimala ), on the Laghu- 
sabdaratna ( com. Bliavaprakasa ). Mr. Govinda Das ( p. 27 in 
Mr. Gharpurc's edition of acara portion ) says that these works were 
really composed by Balambhatta and ascribed to his father. In 
these grammatical works the names of Vaidyanatha's parents are 
given as MahaJeva and Veni. 

The I. O. cat. ( pp. 438-59, No. 1507 ) notices an incomplete 
work called Dharmasastrasarhgraha compiled by Balasarman Paya- 
gmida, son of Vaidyanatha and Laksmi and patronised 11 " by Cole- 
brooke. The work dealt with topics of civil law, viz. definition 
of vyavahara, sabha, the judge, the sabhyas, the relative strength of 
smrtis etc., return of debts etc. It breaks off at folio 79. On the 
ms. there is a note in Colebrooke's own hand ( which is not com- 
plimentary to the honesty of Balasarman ) dated 1st may 1800 
Ci fresh sheets were received from Balasarma Payagurida on this 
date. This is little else but the Viramitrodaya revised. As it is a 
scarce book and very little known Balasarma and his pupil Manu- 
deva did not suspect I could detect the plagiarism." 

The foregoing shows that Balakrsna Payagunda was a Deccani 
Brahmaija, that his father and mother were Vaidyanatha and Laksmi, 
that his maternal grandfather was Mahadeva, also a Deccani Brahmana 
surnamed Kherada, that he was the pupil of Nagojibhatta and that 
he was a pandit of Colebrooke. Mr. Govinda Das is not right when 
he identifies ( p. 27 ) Vaidyanatha the commentator of several 
grammatical works of Nagojibhatta with Vaidyanatha the author of 
several commentaries on Alaftkara works ( such as the Udaharana- 
candrika on the Kavya-prakasa and the Prabha on the Kavyapradipa). 
The reasons are two. Vaidyanatha, author of the Udaharanacandrika, 

1157 *Whufi f^tf jfrmpfro u * *fai *wt «flftTOft ^rf^m^ ISpRppq; 1 



46S History <f DkarmatlUtra 

was the son of Ramabhatta, son of Vitthala Tatsat, while Vaidya- 
natha the grammarian was a son of Mahadeva and Venl. Besides 
the Udaharapacandrika was composed 11 * 8 in sathvat 1740 Kartika 
suddha 8, Wednesday ( i. e. 17th October 1683 ). We saw above 
that Vaidyanatha Payagunda was a pupil of Nagoji, who flourished 
towards the end of 17th and the first half of the 18th century. 
If Vaidyanatha, the writer on poetics, were the same as the com- 
mentator of Nagoji, he could not have composed a .work on 
poetics so early as 1683 A. D. Dr. Belvalkar ( Systems of Sanskrit 
Grammar p. 60 ) says c Laksmidevi, the wife of king Candrasimha 
of Mithila, was probably his patroness in whose honour he is report- 
ed to have composed a commentary on the Vyavaharakanda of the 
Mitaksara. ' This throws to the winds all chronology. We saw 
above ( pp. 399 and 404 ) that the Mithila princess LaksmI or 
Lachimadevi flourished in the first half of the 15 th century, while 
the Balambhatti quoting as it does writers and works like Gagabhatta 
and the Kaustubha could not have been composed before 1700 A.D. 

Mr. Govinda Das says that a ms. of the acarakanda of the 
Balambhatti in the Benares palace library is dated sathvat 183 1 ( i. e. 
1774-75 A. D. ). The I. O. cat. (pp. 458-459 ) notices that Balam- 
bhatta was about 80 years old when Colebrooke entrusted the 
Dharmasastrasamgraha to him about 1800 A. D. Besides both 
Balambhatta and his father Vaidyanatha were the pupils of Nagoji- 
bhatta. The ms. of the Upakrtitattva ( Stein's Jammu cat. p. 302 ) 
is dated sarhvat 1848 i. c. 1791-92 A. D. and the ms. of the Laghu- 
bhusanakanti of Balambhatta's pupil is dated sathvat 1856 (i.e. 
1799-1800 A. D. ). Hence it follows that Balambhatta must have 
flourished between 1730 and 1820 A. D. Mr. Govinda Das says 
that Balambhatta died at the age of 90 and gives his dates as 1740 
to 1830 A. D. ( p. 29 of Mr. Gharpure's acara section of Balam- 
bhatti at the end ).

112. Knilnatha-Vpadhyaya 46* 

112. Kasinatha-Upadhyaya 

Kasinatha Upadhyaya or Baba Padhye composed an extensive 
work called Dharmasindhusara or Dharmabdhisara, which is popular- 
ly known as Dharmasindhu. It is now the leading work in matters 
of religious observances in the Deccan and has been referred to even 
in judicial decisions. IXJ * It has been published several times. In 
the following the Nirnayasagara edition of 1926 with Marathi trans- 
lation has been used. He says that he consulted former nibandhas 
and, following the order of the subject matters in the Nirnayasindhu, 
composed the work which sets forth only the established conclusions 
after eliminating the original smj*ti texts. xx6 ° At the end he says 
that the work is not meant for learned men conversant with 
munfiriisd and Dharmasastra, but for men whose intellect is not 
sharp and yet who want to know the established conclusions on 
matters of dharma. The work is- divided into three paricchedas, the 
third being the longest and split into two parts. The first deals 
with kala in general, viz. the kinds of year, month, the samkrantis, 
intercalary months and ksayamasa, what tithis are proper for what 
rites, conclusions about tithis from the first to the 15 th and about 
amavasya, eclipses ; the second deals with the festivals, fasts 
and observances of particular months from Caitra to Phalguna ; the 
third in the first part speaks in detail about the samskaras from 
garbhadhana to marriage, sapindya, gotras and pravaras, duties of 
brahmacarin, the daily duties from rising to going to bed, the five 
daily mahayajiias, consecration of sacred fires, idols and dedication 
of tanks and works of public utility, kali varjya; the latter part of 
the third pariccheda dilates upon the details of sraddha, impurity on 
birth and death, the rites after death, the duties of widows, sathny&sa. 

Kasinatha was a very learned man and a great devotee of God 
Vitfioba at Pandharpur in the Sholapur District. He wrote several 
other works, such as the PrayascittenduSekhara (Buhler3. no), 
an exposition of the Vedastuti in the Bhagavatapuraija ( X. 87 )

and a work called Vitthala-rfimantrasarabhasya. 1161 In the latter 
he takes several Rk verses (such as Rgveda 1.95,1-11 and I. 1 64. 3 1) 
and explains them as applying to God Vifthala. 

We know a good deal about the family of Kasinatba Padhye 
from his own works and from the biography of the great Marathi 
poet Moropant published by Mr. L. R. Pangarkar (ed.of 1908, chap. 
16 pp. 107-119). His family hailed from Golavali, a village in 
the Ratnagiri District. They were Karhada Brahmanas and had 
the Joshi and Upadhye vrtti of seventy-two villages in the Sangame- 
svara taluka of the Ratnagiri District. At the end of the Dharnia- 
sindhu he says that his grandfather was Kasyupadhyaya who had 
two sons Yajnesvara and Ananta. Ananta was a very pious man 
and a great devotee and left his native land Kofikana, and resided 
at Pandharpur on the banks of the Bhima. The Dharmasindhu 
does not give the reason for Ananta's migration from Kofikana. 
But it is said that the Padhyes had a dispute with another family 
about the upadhye vrtti, took it for decision 10 the Peshwa's Court 
at Poona and were defeated, on which they cursed the Peshwa, 
vowed not to stay in the territories under the Peshwa's rule and 
migrated to Pandharpur. The Dharmasindhu was composed 116 * 
in Jake 17121. e. 1790-1 A. D. Kasinatha was related to the great 
Marathi poet Moropant, as his daughter Avadi was married to Rama- 
kpsija, the second son of the poet. He had great veneration for 
Moropant and refers to the Mantrabhagavata of the latter. il6j

After the British took over the administration of Bengal from 
the Nabobs, attempts were made to compile easily accessible digests 
of the personal law of the Hindus. The Vivadarnavasetu"** com- 
piled in 1773 for Warren Hastings by several pandits was translated 
into English from a Persian rendering and was published in 1774 
A. D. as Halhed's Gentoo Code. But this was a very unsatisfactory 
work. Another attempt was made at the instance of Sir William 
Jones by Trivedi Sarvorusarman who compiled in 1789 A. D. a 
digest of civil law called Vivadasararpava" 66 in nine tarangas. But 
the most famous of such digests that owed their inspiration to the 
British is the Vivadabhangarnava compiled by Jagannatha Tarkapan- 
canana of Triveni on the Ganges, son of Rudra Tarkavagisa. 
This digest was suggested by Sir William Jones and two parts 
of it on contracts and succession were translated by Cole-

A. D. and is known to the legal profession as Colebrooke's Digest. 
This work exercised great influence over the courts in their admi- 
nistration of Hindu Law in the early days. The work is divided 
into dvipas y each dvipa being subdivided into ratnas. The principal 
topics dealt with are : recovery of debts, deposits, sale without 
ownership, partnership, rescission of gifts, non-payment of wages, 
rescission of sale and purchase, emancipation from slavery, disputes 
between master and servant, duties of man and wife, inheritance 
and partition. Jagann&ha is said to have died at the venerable age 
of in in i8o6. ,,6 7 Though Jagannatha exercised great influence 
in moulding Hindu Law in Bengal, his work has been held from 
very early times not to have any binding authority in Western 
India. 1168 

114. Conclusion 

In the foregoing pages most of the classical works and the most 
prominent writers on Dharmasastra during a period of about twenty 
five centuries have been passed in review. The number of authors, 
and works on dharmasastra is legion. All these numberless authors 
and works were actuated by the most laudable motives of regulat- 
ing the Aryan society in all matters, civil, religious and moral, and 
of securing for the members of that society happiness in this world 
and the next. They laid the greatest emphasis on the duties of 
every man as a member of the whole Aryan society, as a member 
of the particular class to which he belonged and very little emphasis 
on the privileges of men. They created great solidarity and cohesion 
among the several classes of the Aryan society in India in spite of 
their conflicting interests and inclinations and enabled Hindu society 
to hold its own against successive aggressions of foreign invaders. 
They preserved Hindu culture and literature in the midst of alien 
cultures and in spite of bigoted foreign domination. There is no 
doubt that the authors on dharmasastra in their desire to evolve 
order out of chaos and to adjust and harmonise the varying 
practices of people with the dicta of ancient sages were guilty 
of the faults of raising hair-splitting arguments, divisions and.

sub-divisions and also of thinking that religious rites and 
formularies were the be-all and end-all of human existence. 
But living as most of the later writers did in the midst 
of aggressive and violently unsympathetic cultures and rulers and 
possessing no powerful central government that sympathised with 
their ideals, they were driven more and more to revolve within 
their own narrow grooves and could not see far in order to regulate 
society in a free and buoyant spirit. In spite of these defects, the 
work done by the writers on dharma&stra should excite our admira- 
tion and entitles them to the regard of all those that are interested in 
the study of the vicissitudes of Hindu society for thousands of years.

APPENDIX A. 



List of Works on Dharmasastra 

It is necessary to say. a few words about the methods followed in 
preparing this list of the works on dharmasastra. Purely srauta 
works have generally been excluded, except where they have been 
profusely quoted or relied upon by dharmasastra writers. Works 
of the Tantra class and the Puranas have been passed over, inas- 
much as they form in themselves independent and extensive 
branches of Sanskrit literature requiring an exhaustive and detailed 
treatment, which from considerations of space had to be abandoned 
here. All individual prayogas, mahatmyas, vidhis, vratas, santis, 
stotrashave been omitted, except where the names of the authors are 
well-known or there is some importance or peculiarity attaching to 
them. Purely astrological works on jataka, and tajika have not 
been included, but works of the muhurta class that are closely con- 
nected with everyday religious practices have been included. 
Though the grhyasutras and their commentaries were not dwelt 
upon in the body of the present work, they have been included 
in this list as their subject-matter is closely allied to dharma- 
sastra. Only works up to about 1820 A. D. have been entered 
here. Works on politics ( arthasastra ) have also been in- 
cluded. I am afraid that all the restrictions set out above have 
not been rigorously observed in the following and crave the 
indulgence of scholars in this respect. I must gratefully acknow- 
ledge, as everyone engaged in preparing a similar list on any 
branch of post-Vedic literature must do, my indebtedness to the 
monumental Catalogus Catalogorum of Dr. Aufrecht. But even that 
catalogue leaves many things doubtful and necessarily gives meagre 
information. For removing such doubts I was compelled to read 
and compare the original catalogues of Sanskrit mss. such as that 
of the India Office, the Notices of Sanskrit mss. by Dr. Mitra and 
and M. M. Hnraprasada. Besides the third part of Aufrecht's 
Catalogue was published in 1903. Since then several other 
catalogues, such as the Descriptive Catalogues and Triennial 
Catalogues of the Madras Govt. mss. Library, Notices of mss. ( new 



104 tliticry qf JbharmailUtra 

scries, part III) by M. M. Haraprasad §astri, Catalogue of Palmleaf and 
Paper mss. of Nepal Durbar Library by M. M. Haraprasad Sastri, 
Hultzsch's Report ( part III ), Catalogue of Central Provinces 
Sanskrit mss. by Rai Bahadur Hiralal and Catalogue of the mss. 
collected by the Bihar and Orissa Govt. ( vol. I ), have been 
published. Moreover I have consulted hundreds of mss. from 
collections like those at the Deccan College (now in the Bhandarkar 
O. R. Institute at Poona), at the Anandasrama Institution (Poona), 
the Bhadkamkar memorial collection started by Prof. H. D. Velankar 
in Bombay at the Wilson College and the vast collection of the Baroda 
Oriental Institute. In preparing this list I give wherever possible and 
desirable the names of the authors and of their ancestors, 
the names of the works quoted by them or of the works 
that quote them, the age of the work ( or of the mss. ) 
their contents &c. In most cases the very name of the 
work indicates its subject-matter. In spite of all this many doubt- 
ful points are still left. Various circumstances tend to create confusion 
in preparing such lists as are offered here. The same work appears 
under two, three or even more names in the mss. and the cata- 
logues. Sometimes the names of the authors and even their fathers' 
names are the same as in the case of Divakara, son of Mahadeva and 
Sankara, son of Nilakantha. Very often portions of a large work 
appear separately as distinct works in the Catalogues. The same 
author appears under several forms, as Narasimha and Nrsimha, 
Nagesa and Nagoji. I have made great efforts to remove such 
doubts as far as I could and hope that I have been able to make 
my own humble contributions to the work so ably done by 
Aufrecht and others. I do not give references to catalogues in the 
case of each work, nor do I give all possible references to catalogues 
against each entry. Only in imporant cases have I given references 
to catalogues. It has been my endeavour to give earlier references 
to works and authors wherever I could than those given by 
Aufrecht and to find out the age of a work or author by resort to 
various devices. Only a detailed comparison with Aufrecht can 
show this, which task I must in all humility leave to the readers 
who will use this list. One more feature of this list to which I 
wish to draw the attention of the reader is that I have pointed out 
what works have been printed. In doing this I generally refer only 
to well-known series and editions like the Bombay Sanskrit series, 



tdst qf Works an Dharmaitisfra 505 

the Benares Sanskrit series and have not set out editions to which 
very few can have access. For those who want exhaustive informa- 
tion on this point, the catalogues of printed works in the British 
Museum Library which have now been brought up to 1928 will be 
found helpful.

APPENDIX B 
LIST OF AUTHORS ON DHARMASASTRA 

While preparing this list, great difficulties were experienced in 
stating all the works composed by an author. In the case of such 
names as Ananta, Krsna, Gatigadhara, Narayaga, Ramalcrsqa, SaA- 
kara, which are extremely common, the only method that could be 
followed, in the absence of materials to identify the authors bearing 
these names, was to place the same name several times in the list 
against the work composed by that author. Since the authors 
themselves very often convey no more information than their own 
names and since some of the reports on the search for mss. do not 
give even what little information about the author can be gathered 
from the ms. of his work, Aufrecht also was compelled to follow 
this method. In order to avoid repetition and save space, I have 
not repeated in this list the information that was given under the 
works contained in the list A. Dates are given principally under 
the names of authors and sometimes under works also. For further 
information readers will have in many cases to refer to the works 
put down as composed by an author. In the case of authors who 
have written on several fostras, their works on dharma&stra alone 
have been mentioned. Wherever possible parentage has been noted 
and dates assigned. In a few cases information which became 
available after list A was prepared has been incorporated here.
