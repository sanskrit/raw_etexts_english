## XLIII

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

BALTIMORE, \[MARYLAND\]

*3 November 1894*

DEAR MOTHER,

I do not know what to say about this phonograph business. It takes six
months to go to India!! and the company cannot get an inquiry in another
six months!!! American express, indeed!! Well — however, they are bound
to make good my money. Mother, do not lose the receipt of the express
company.

I am going to New York as soon as possible.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA
