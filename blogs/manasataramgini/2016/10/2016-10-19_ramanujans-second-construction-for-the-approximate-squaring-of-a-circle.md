title = "Ramanujan’s second construction for the approximate squaring of a circle"

+++
To experience the greatness of great men one has to relive or redo some
acts of theirs to the best of ones ability. In ones youth such
enactments might inspire one to make a bid for greatness. Whether this
happens or not is mostly up to your genetics. Nevertheless, through the
enactments one can at least savor the experience of what it takes to get
there. If there was one man in our midst who could have lived up to be a
Gauss or an Euler it was Srinivasa Ramanujan.

By redoing some of his acts that are within the grasp of our limited
intellect we experienced the monument that he was. He gave two
constructions for the approximate squaring of a circle using a compass
and a straight-edge. [We had earlier described the first and more widely
known of
those](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/squaring-of-the-circle-by-srinivasa-ramanujan/).
The second appears in his paper titled “*Modular equations and
approximations to*
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi")“. In this paper in addition to remarkable approximations for the
perimeter of the ellipse, [which we had also alluded to
before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/a-personal-discursion-on-conic-sections/),
he gives several series for
![\\pi=3.141592653589793...](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%3D3.141592653589793...&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi=3.141592653589793..."). One of these series with just the first
term leads to the below approximation:  
![\\pi \\approx \\dfrac{99^2}{2\*\\sqrt{2}\*1103} =
3.141592730013305](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+%5Cdfrac%7B99%5E2%7D%7B2%2A%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%2A1103%7D+%3D+3.141592730013305&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi \\approx \\dfrac{99^2}{2*\\sqrt{2}*1103} = 3.141592730013305")
which is correct down to 6 decimal places. It is this kind of accuracy
he captures in his first construction for the quadrature of the circle.
In the midst of the dizzying series he conjures in a very Hindu style of
mathematics, he says that he came up with an empirical approximation
which leads to the below construction for the approximate squaring of
the circle:

![ramanujan\_squaring\_circle2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/ramanujan_squaring_circle2.png?w=640)

1\) Draw circle to be squared with center O.  
2\) Draw its diameter
![\\overline{AB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}").  
3\) Trisect its radius
![\\overline{AO}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAO%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AO}") to get a third of it as
![\\overline{AF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AF}").  
4\) Bisect the semicircle AB to get point C.  
5\) Draw
![\\overline{BC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BC}").  
6\) On
![\\overline{BC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BC}") mark ![\\overline{CG}=
\\overline{GH}=\\overline{AF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BCG%7D%3D+%5Coverline%7BGH%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BAF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{CG}= \\overline{GH}=\\overline{AF}").  
7\) Join point A to point H to get
![\\overline{AH}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAH%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AH}") and to point G to get
![\\overline{AG}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAG%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AG}")  
8\) With radius as
![\\overline{AG}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAG%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AG}") cut
![\\overline{AH}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAH%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AH}") to get point I.  
9\) Draw a line parallel to
![\\overline{GH}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BGH%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{GH}") through point I to cut
![\\overline{AG}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAG%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AG}") at point J.  
10\) Join points O and J to get
![\\overline{OJ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOJ%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OJ}").  
11\) Draw a line parallel to
![\\overline{OJ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOJ%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OJ}") through point F to cut
![\\overline{AG}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAG%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AG}") at point K.  
12\) Draw the tangent to the circle at point A and cut it with radius as
![\\overline{AK}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAK%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AK}") to get point L.  
13\) Draw
![\\overrightarrow{OL}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverrightarrow%7BOL%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overrightarrow{OL}") to cut circle at point M.  
14\) Draw semicircle LM and perpendicular from point O to cut this
semicircle at point N.  
15\) Triplicate
![\\overline{ON}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BON%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{ON}") to get ![\\overline{OQ}=3 \\times
\\overline{ON}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOQ%7D%3D3+%5Ctimes+%5Coverline%7BON%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OQ}=3 \\times \\overline{ON}").  
16\) Produce
![\\overline{OQ}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOQ%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OQ}") in the opposite direction to cut circle at point R.  
17\) Draw semicircle RQ and a perpendicular from point O to cut it at
point S.  
18\) Thus, we have
![\\overline{OS}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOS%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OS}") as the side of the square OSTU which has approximately
the same area the starting circle.

Ramanujan tells us that his earlier construction gave an “ordinary”
value ![\\pi \\approx
\\dfrac{355}{113}=3.141592920353982](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+%5Cdfrac%7B355%7D%7B113%7D%3D3.141592920353982&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi \\approx \\dfrac{355}{113}=3.141592920353982"), which is correct
to six decimal places. This one, however, gives us the value:  
![\\pi \\approx \\left (9^2+\\dfrac{19^2}{22}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}}=
3.141592652582646](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi+%5Capprox+%5Cleft+%289%5E2%2B%5Cdfrac%7B19%5E2%7D%7B22%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D%7D%3D+3.141592652582646&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi \\approx \\left (9^2+\\dfrac{19^2}{22}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}}= 3.141592652582646")  
This is correct to a whopping eight decimal places keeping with the
Hindu love for big numbers.
