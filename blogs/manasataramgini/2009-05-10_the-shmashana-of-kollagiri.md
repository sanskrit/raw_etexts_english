title = "The shmashAna ofxa0kollagiri"

+++
Beating our Damaru we advanced to the great ground of kollagiri;  
We recited the face mantra-s of the archer ranging on the high adri;  
In our Aj\~na chakra stood the bright pinAkin, famed as para-shiva;  
In his embrace was clasped chit-parA, the fair queen of bhairava.

To transcend pain and pleasure and to rest in the of ocean of bliss;  
We translocated to ambikAâ€™s site, the melApaka, in the manner of
vIra-s;  
We raised our arm and displayed the Chomma of the two horns;  
We waited for her, who makes one a siddha, to come in our arms.
