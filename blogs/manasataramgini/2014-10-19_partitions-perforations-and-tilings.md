title = "Partitions, perforations and tilings"

+++
We are “geometric” in our thinking – perhaps, we are hence a little more
Greek or the old type Arya than the later Hindu (who is more algebraic)
in mentality. Long back in college we were fascinated by implicit
trigonometric relations but were utterly defeated by the difficulty in
visualizing. Without visualization, of what use are these relations to
one who is inclined towards visible geometry? Then we wrote a bit of
code that allowed us to visualize the same. Today far more efficient
programs exist to do the same and we tend to revisit these relations,
perhaps as a reenactment of our childish fancies.

During those explorations of ours we realized that certain class of
trigonometric relations exist which produce the following:  
1\) Partitions: These might be defined as divisions of the x-y plane
into continuous zones of 2 colors.  
2\) Perforations: These can be defined as completely bounded zones which
can be visualized as perforations of the x-y plane.  
Now, there might be relations which generate both partitions and
perforations at the same time.  
3\) Depressions and bosses: They might be visualized as incomplete
precursors of perforations in the x-y plane with the plane being
deformed in either direction by vectors perpendicular to it.  
4\) Tilings: These completely tile the x-y plane by means of bounded
tiles that share edges. There might be tiles which bear perforations or
depressions and bosses on them.  
5\) Loopings: These might be defined as adjacent perforations that
become contiguous via intersections involving a single point.

To illustrate these let us consider the below relationship:  
![cot(cos^{3} (x-y)+sin^{2} (x+y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)|
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cot%28cos%5E%7B3%7D+%28x-y%29%2Bsin%5E%7B2%7D+%28x%2By%29%29%3E%7Csin%28x%2By%29-cos%28x-y%29%7C+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=1
"cot(cos^{3} (x-y)+sin^{2} (x+y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)| ")  
It produces the below figure below which includes both partitions and
perforations (the rhombuses with concave sides).

Some of these can have highly twisted partitions, in this case combined
with depressions and bosses, that superficially make it look like a
tiling (the figure to the right) as produced by:  
![tan(13cos^{3}(x-y)+17sin^{3}(x+y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)|
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=tan%2813cos%5E%7B3%7D%28x-y%29%2B17sin%5E%7B3%7D%28x%2By%29%29%3E%7Csin%28x%2By%29-cos%28x-y%29%7C+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"tan(13cos^{3}(x-y)+17sin^{3}(x+y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)| ")

Now let us consider the relation:  
![sin(9sin^{2}(x+y) \\pm 12cos^{2}(x-y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)|
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=sin%289sin%5E%7B2%7D%28x%2By%29+%5Cpm+12cos%5E%7B2%7D%28x-y%29%29%3E%7Csin%28x%2By%29-cos%28x-y%29%7C+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"sin(9sin^{2}(x+y) \\pm 12cos^{2}(x-y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)| ")  
It produces perforations that show some complexity

Now let us consider the relation:  
![cot(cos(x-y)+sin(x+y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)|
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cot%28cos%28x-y%29%2Bsin%28x%2By%29%29%3E%7Csin%28x%2By%29-cos%28x-y%29%7C+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=1
"cot(cos(x-y)+sin(x+y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)| ")  
This produces a tiling but the tiles respectively have depressions or
bosses.

The introduction of an irrational constant like
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") adds a new wrinkle to these relations. For example let us
consider:  
![sec(9sin^{8}(x+\\phi y)+4cos^{8}(\\phi x-y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)|
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=sec%289sin%5E%7B8%7D%28x%2B%5Cphi+y%29%2B4cos%5E%7B8%7D%28%5Cphi+x-y%29%29%3E%7Csin%28x%2By%29-cos%28x-y%29%7C+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"sec(9sin^{8}(x+\\phi y)+4cos^{8}(\\phi x-y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)| ")  
The Golden ratio ![\\phi=1.61803398875

"\\phi=1.61803398875  ")

The irrationality of the constant manifests in the resultant partitions,
perforations, depressions/bosses in form an endless diversity of
patterns – i.e. you do not get the same thing again even though they all
look similar. This discovery greatly pleased us when we first stumbled
upon it.

We shall conclude with a foray into the realm of personal symbolism.
Below is what we term the gaze of indra intertwined with the gaze of
Odin; produced by:  
![cot(4sin^{2}(x+y)+13cos^{2}(x-y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)|
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cot%284sin%5E%7B2%7D%28x%2By%29%2B13cos%5E%7B2%7D%28x-y%29%29%3E%7Csin%28x%2By%29-cos%28x-y%29%7C+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"cot(4sin^{2}(x+y)+13cos^{2}(x-y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)| ")

[![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rvmOAf1IRLU/VESaqPjQc0I/AAAAAAAADJk/M-ShYKaX4Xk/s800/Odin_varuNa.jpg)](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/zwsFsWf4X_5IU0Y0fYttPNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite)

Why do we call it so? In Hindu tradition indra is said to have a 1000
eyes with which he watches over all. Hence, those many rows of eyes
gazing at us are those of indra. Now in Germanic lore Odin is said to
have sacrificed an eye of his at the well of Mimir. While he was left
with just one eye, the drink at the well made him all knowing. Hence, we
depict the second set of rows as representing the all-knowing gaze of
Odin with only one eye being function and the other blind. The ocular
anomaly is something he shares with his Hindu cognate rudra. While rudra
is typically known as three-eyed, he is also described as being one-eyed
in the rudra rahasya-gAna of the sAmaveda. This ocular trait is
inherited by a subset of the ectypes of rudra known as the vidyeshvara-s
who form part of the saiddhAntika shaiva pantheon. As an aside one may
also note the “black grid” optical illusion produced by it.

The next one is termed the gaze of bhaga and aryaman and is generated
by:  
![cot(3sin^{2}(x+y)+cos^{3}(x-y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)|
](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cot%283sin%5E%7B2%7D%28x%2By%29%2Bcos%5E%7B3%7D%28x-y%29%29%3E%7Csin%28x%2By%29-cos%28x-y%29%7C+&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=1
"cot(3sin^{2}(x+y)+cos^{3}(x-y))\>|sin(x+y)-cos(x-y)| ")

[![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3P01Fxc2oJ4/VESap0RN_gI/AAAAAAAADJg/E67SXeCgsXc/s800/bhaga_aryaman.jpg)](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2EjgJgEcCD621VcJpktxUdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite)

Here there are two sets of quasi-symmetric face-like figures with eyes
and a mouth. Of these aryaman is the far-seeing one with normal eyes,
while bhaga is the one with blind eyes. Hindu tradition going back to
the shruti records a legend of bhaga losing his eyes when rudra attacked
the yaj\~na or prajApati. In the mahAbhArata the heroes are cast in the
image of the ancient gods. In this matrix some of them are very obvious
in their resemblance to the gods. Among the non-obvious ones are vidura
who is cast in the image of the all-seeing aryaman, who is also the
regent of the homestead, and the blind dhR^itarAShTra who is cast in the
image of bhaga. Among the Aditya-s the first and the most prominent pair
are mitra and varuNa, they are followed by the pair aryaman and bhaga.
The former pair is potentially partitioned between pANDu and
yudhiShThira in the mahAbhArata.
