SALEM (U.S.A.),  
*30th Aug., 1893*.

DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (HONOURABLE PROFESSOR) (Prof. John Henry Wright),

I am going off from here today. I hope you have received some reply from
Chicago. I have received an invitation with full directions from Mr.
Sanborn. So I am going to Saratoga on Monday. My respects to your wife.
And my love to Austin and all the children. You are a real Mahâtmâ (a
great soul) and Mrs. Wright is nonpareil.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
