*To Sister Nivedita*

SAN FRANCISCO,  
*26th May, 1900*.

DEAR NIVEDITA,

All blessings on you. Don't despond in the least. *Shri wah Guru*! *Shri
wah Guru*! You come of the blood of a Kshatriya. Our yellow garb is the
robe of death on the field of battle. Death for the cause is our goal,
not success. *Shri wah Guru*! . . .

Black and thick are the folds of sinister fate. But I am the master. I
raise my hand, and lo, they vanish! All this is nonsense. And fear? I am
the Fear of fear, the Terror of terror, I am the fearless secondless
One, I am the Rule of destiny, the Wiper-out of fact. *Shri wah Guru*!
Steady, child, don't be bought by gold or anything else, and we win!

VIVEKANANDA.
