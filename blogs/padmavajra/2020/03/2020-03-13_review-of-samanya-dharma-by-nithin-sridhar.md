Book title: Samanya Dharma

Author:Nithin Sridhar

This book gives a good introduction to dharma,and what dharmas are
common to all humans,but specifically to those who are Hindus(since
devotion to devas and gurus is definitely a part of some of its
definitions,which are more expanded versions of the more concise
definitions that don’t explicitly state it). It notes the seeds of these
ideas in various shrutivAkyas and then nicely,in various places puts
them as elucidated in various smR^itis and purANas,and notes their
social benefit and usefulness/importance in yoga of all
forms(pAta\~njala,bhaktimArga,etc) and sAdhanA.

This is a book that is useful in educating Hindus about the basic
dharma-s that they need to follow,especially in an era where certain
classes of middle-class people do not have anything substantial to
explain dharma beyond ‘way of life’ platitudes,and claiming ‘anything
goes’ in Hinduism. All in all,a very good,neat little book that I would
recommend to any Hindu(and in whatever language they know/speak).
