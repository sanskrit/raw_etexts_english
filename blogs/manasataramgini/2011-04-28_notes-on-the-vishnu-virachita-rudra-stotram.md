title = "Notes on the viShNu-virachita rudra stotram"

+++
The early history of the imagery of rudra within the Indo-Aryan
tradition (as an ortholog of the deities elsewhere in the Indo-European
world, like Apollo and Odin) can be traced through a large body of
texts. These include in approximate chronological order:  
1\) The earliest layer in the R^igveda – RV 1.43; 1.114; 2.33 and 6.74
among others.  
2\) The nIlarudra and atharva-rudra sUkta-s of the AV-P and and
AV-vulgate respectively.  
3\) The shatarUdrIya and the tryaMbaka homa mantra-s of the yajur-veda
saMhitA-s.  
4\) The vrAtya rudra sUkta (AV-vulgate 15.5).  
5\) The shUlagava mantra-s/kaushItakI shUlgava section.  
6\) The mahAnArAyaNopaniShat.  
7\) The shvetAshavataropaniShat.  
8\) The atharvashiras.  
9\) The AV parishiShTha on the pAshupata vrata.  
10\) The mahAbharata – the ajAnana-virachita rudra stotra.  
11\) The harivaMsha – viShNu-virachita rudra stotra.

These offer an opportunity to examine the continuity and evolution in
the emergence of the imagery of rudra. We shall now briefly examine the
last of the above-mentioned texts. In several ways it is related to the
ajAnana-virachita rudra stotra attributed to dakSha after he was revived
with the head of a goat by rudra. It is found in the 87th chapter of the
3rd parvan of the vulgate text of the harivaMsha and is supposed to have
been composed by viShNu to praise rudra. The entire stotra is given
below:

The above analysis shows that the majority of epithets of rudra in this
stuti are of Vedic provenance and cover the entire temporal spectrum of
Vedic development all the way from the RV to the late upaniShat and
parishiShTha texts. However, the stuti shows some developments that have
no apparent precedence in much of the surviving Vedic corpus:  
1\) rudra as the bearer of the shUla. Right in the RV, rudra is
repeatedly described as tigmAyudha or tigmaheti, i.e., one with a sharp
weapon (may be a cognate of Odin’s spear). However, nowhere is this
weapon specified as being a shUla or a trishUla. The word shUla itself
occurs in the RV and means a stake, such as that used to roast
sacrificial meat in the ashvamedha ritual (could be a doubtful cognate
of greek Xulon). In the shUlagava ritual described in the gR^ihya
sUtra-s the term again is for the sacrificial stake. But as the name for
the sharp weapon of rudra it becomes apparent only in the epic. This
points to a semantic expansion of the word shUla to include a sharp
weapon. With this expansion, it appears to have taken the place of the
tigmAyudha of the veda, perhaps via its use in the shUlagava of rudra.
However, it should be noted that the vajra or the thunder-bolt is
regarded as a weapon of rudra right from the RV itself. Similarly,
tridents are archaeologically attested in depictions on Indus and
Mesopotamian sites that overlap temporally with the Vedic period. The
bronze age deities of the Middle East are routinely shown with tridents:
e.g. Enlil. In many of these bronze age Eurasian icons the trident held
by a deity actually stands for the thunder-bolt, which is an equivalent
of the vajra (e.g. the iconography of the Hittite Tarhun=Teshub). Hence,
it is possible that the trishUla in the classical Agama/purANa
iconography of rudra is a conflation of the original vajra, which was
historically shown as three-pronged, and the tigmAyudha, which had come
to be known as the shUla (as in the above stuti).

2\) The khaTvA\~Nga/kapAla. The skull as an attribute of rudra is not
mentioned in the core saMhitA-s of the shruti and only finds mention in
the AV-parishiShTha. Now, the khaTvA\~Nga or the skull-topped brand as
an attribute of rudra is clearly mentioned for the first time in the
texts of great epic layer, for example, as seen in this stuti. Apastamba
states in his dharmasUtra (APS 1.28-29) that a murderer who has
committed the great sin of killing a brAhmaNa should use a kapAla as a
bowl and carry a khaTvA\~Nga. Similar gautama states that a brAhmaNa
killer should live a celibate life for twelve years carrying a kapAla
and a khaTvA\~Nga and proclaiming his sin while begging for food (GDS
22.4). A similar statement is found in the baudhAyana dharmasUtra (BDS
2.1.3.1) along with the further injunction that the sinner lives in the
cremation ground. The tale of rudra killing prajApati is seen in the RV
itself and is repeatedly described in the brAhmaNa-s. This act might
have associated rudra, even in the vedic period, with brahmahatyA, as it
is done in the purANa-s. This appears to have been the precedence for
the transference of the brahmaghna’s attributes to rudra. The
celebration of the skull as a “positive” attribute of rudra rather than
as a mark of his “dark” side emerges in the purANa-s like the skanda
puraNa (vulgate). In the avantikhANDa there is tale of how kapAla-s
repeatedly appear in the middle of the vedI when the brAhmaNa-s are
performing a ritual to rudra. The brAhmaNa-s place these skulls outside
the yaj\~nashAlA each time one appears as they were thought to be
desecrating the fire. This resulted in a pyramid of skulls accumulating
outside the yaj\~nashAlA in a particular spot. The brAhmaNa-s later
discovered that these skulls were marking the site of the great li\~Nga
of mahAkAla.

3\) The cremation ground dweller/delighter, shmashAna-rati. In the
pAraskAra gR^ihyasUtra (3.15) it is declared that one should invoke
rudra with the initial R^ik-s of the shatarudrIya, especially when one
is passing by cross roads or a cremation ground. This suggests that
there was an ancient link between rudra and the cremation grounds, among
other wild places, which was more explicitly developed in the texts of
the epic layer.

4\) chandrashekhara. Right from the veda, rudra was identified with the
sun and the moon. Thus, in the rudra recitation of the kaushitaki
brAhmaNa we have: “yan mahAn deva Adityas tena |” and “yad rudrash
chandramAs tena |”. This is reproduced in the above stuti in:
“namash-chandrAya devAya sUryAya cha namo namaH |”. However, in the
texts associated with the great epic we have for the first time an
iconographic regarding rudra as the bearer of the lunar digit. A lunar
association of rudra might be concealed under the vaidika dvandva
“somArudrA”. Also related to this link is the fact that in the
Eurasian bronze age we find several horned deities. At least in
Mesopotamia the bovine horns are taken to represent the crescent moon
(e.g. on Nannar or Marduk’s headgear). Hence, it is possible that the
lunar crest of rudra is a more direct representation of the horns that
are so common in the iconography of bronze age Eurasian deities.

5\) The lover of liquors, madya-pAna-priya. The use of psycho-active
substances by rudra and his followers is not unknown in the veda itself.
In the famous sUkta of the keshin-s (RV 10.136) the keshin drinks the
viSha prepared from the kunannamA seeds. While the above stuti
explicitly associates liquor with rudra, we can trace the beginning of
this association to a special ritual action in the preparation of the
beer offered in the Vedic sautramaNI ritual. The shatapatha brAhmaNa
states (12.7.3.20) that the powdered hair of the lion, tiger and wolf
are mixed into the beer because if he mixed the powder into the milk
cups he would offer his cattle to rudra pashupati. The liquor is
associated with rudra because it makes one “raudra” upon drinking. By
putting the hair powder in the beer the ritualist unites the animals
which belongs to rudra with him. Thus, pashupati only goes with the wild
animals and spares the yajamAna’s domestic animals. In any case the
explicit mention in this stuti is an important point because it marks a
development in the direction of worship that was to become typical of
the vama and bhairava srotas and their kaula evolutes.

6\) kubja, the crooked one. This appellation is striking because it was
to reappear much later in the tradition of the kubjikA-mata,where rudra
is called kubjIshana. At first sight this might seem convergent and
based on the name of the shakti kubjikA. But we strongly suspect this is
not a coincidence. In fact we suspect that the name has a long history
that goes back to the earliest Vedic layers. In RV 1.114 he is called
va\~Nku that has a meaning similar to kubja. Thus, kubja in the context
of rudra and his shakti kubjikA in the mantra-mArga appear to have
descended from this old epithet.

The historical importance of this stuti is in establishing the relative
era when the classical iconography of rudra became prevalent and also
providing evidence for the emergence of certain attributes that were
magnified in the non-saiddhAntika srotAMsi. The saiddhAntika srotas
emphasizes the benign facets, and “clean” of rudra (now transcending his
previous rudra forms as the supreme deity of the Urdhvasrotas,
sadAshiva). The other srotAMsi emphasize the terrible, the ferocious and
“unclean” aspects of rudra in different combinations and degrees or all
of them together. There is hardly any doubt that in the veda the dread
of rudra is repeatedly alluded to. To consider a few examples:

1\) In the agnihotra ritual the hotar holds out the sruk two times to
the north. With this he pleases rudra in his own direction (north) and
rudra goes away pleased. If the yajamAna were to stand to the north when
the offering is being made he comes in the way of the fierce rudra and
could be seized by him (kaushitaki brAhmaNa 2.2, also mentioned in the
kaTha and maitrAyaNIya saMhitA-s, gopatha brAhmaNa of the AV tradition,
and in the shA\~NkhAyana brAhmaNa the northward offering is combined for
rudra with Ursa Major). The kaTha and maitrAyanIya texts explain that
during this agnihotra offering rudra must be implored for mercy using
the mantra-s that contain the special names of rudra, anAbhu (ruthless;
anArbhava among the North Indian kaTha-s) and dhUrta (roguish;
subsequently this dhUrta mantra is transferred to kumAra). These names
are said to be dreadful manifestations of rudra that destroy animals. By
using these names he pleases rudra and pacifies him with respect to the
yajamAna. At the same time he destroys or drives away those who
illegitimately partake of the offerings and harm his ritual.

2\) In the tradition of the kaTha-s and the maitrAyaNIya-s a special
agnihotra of 12 days is offered if rudra seizes his animals. In this
ritual as per the kaTha-s he makes a recitation of an offering mantra
where he replaces the name rudra with jAtavedas – an euphemism to avoid
the dread of rudra. In the KS and MS it is mentioned that rudra smears
the plants with poison and so the cattle are unable to eat it. The
poison is removed by prajApati via the action of agni. This is given as
reason for the samidh offered to prajApati, and at the same time evokes
the dread to rudra.

3\) The tradition of the aitareya brAhmaNa the hotar introduces peculiar
vikR^iti-s to the R^ik RV 2.33.1 so that the fury of rudra does not fall
on the yajamAna:  
In place of the actual mantra he recites:  
A te pitar marutAM sumnam etu mA naH sUryasya sandR^iSho yuyothAH |  
tvaM no vIro arvati kShameta pra jAyemahi rudriya prajAbhiH ||  
This brAhmaNa tradition holds that by using “tvaM naH” in place of the
original “abhi naH” rudra is not directed toward the yajamAna’s family
and cattle. By using rudriya instead of rudra he reduces the terror
arising from the mention of the real name of rudra, who has just been
described in the brAhmaNa as having slain prajApati. Alternatively the
hotar might entirely drop this mantra and substitute it with the gAyatrI
to rudra composed by gotamo rAhUgaNa (RV 1.43.6):  
shaM naH karatyarvate sugaM meShAya meShye | nR^ibhyo nAribhyo gave ||  
The brAhmaNa explains this substitution by indicating that this mantra
does not mention rudra by name and thereby averts the terror arising
from the mention of his name. Secondly, it begins with the positive word
shaM, which indicates auspiciousness.

From these points a paradoxical point of note emerges: On one hand, the
veda, while stressing the dread of rudra, avoids any detailed
description of the dreadful and unclean forms of rudra and tries to
primarily describe his benign facets. The tendency is amplified in the
tradition outlined in the aitareya in the substitution followed in the
rudra mantra. This is in keeping with the general tendency in the vedic
ritual where there is a strong tendency to avoid the mention of dreadful
aspects of rudra in ones vicinity. On the other hand, there appears to
be a countercurrent (e.g. the agnihotra mantra-s of the KS and MS) to
specifically mention the dreadful names of rudra as a means of appeasing
his dreadful aspects (also seen to certain degree in the shatarudrIya of
the YV saMhitA-s). This appears to represent an ancestral paradox in the
rituals to rudra, a dimorphism that appears to have continued in course
of the development of the sectarian shaiva system and Hindu
[literature](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/04/11/the-richness-of-meaning/).
In the early layers of the shiva shAsana, there was an emphasis on the
benign face of rudra (e.g. his name shiva) and a stress on ritual purity
in his worship. This trend is dominant in the shvetAshvatara,
atharvashiras and the system of the pAshupata vrata expounded in the AV
parishiShTha-s and the pAshupata sUtra-s. It was this tendency that
continued with the lakula-s and their kAlAmukha successors and
eventually came to be the mainstay of the siddhAnta tantra-s of the
mantra mArga with sadAshiva as their central devatA. The above stuti
suggests that there was probably a counter-current wherein the emphasis
was on the terrible and the unclean aspects of rudra (the stuti gives
“both sides of the coin”) even within the early shiva shAsana. This is
encapsulated in the names like kapAlin, khaTvA\~Ngin, shmashAna-rati,
madya-pAna-priya, nagna and making of frightening noises: ghaTighaTa or
tuTituTa (compare with names of early bhUta tantra-s of the pashchima
srotas: hAhAkAraM, shivAravaM, ghorATTahAsaM and ghurghuraM). This led
to the kApAlika tradition of the atimArga that was a mirror of the more
purity emphasizing pAshupata-s (that is the version of the atimArga
based on the somasiddhAnta texts).
