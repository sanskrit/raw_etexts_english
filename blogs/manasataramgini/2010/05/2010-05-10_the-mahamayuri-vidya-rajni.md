We had earlier mentioned how the mahAmAyUrI-vidyA-rAj\~nI (MVR), an
early kriyA tantra of the tAthAgata-s, is an important text to
understand the evolutionary transition in the mantra-shAstra from the
vaidika to the tAntrika state. Gathering texts that illustrate this
transition is an important part of the study of the origins of the
AgamashAstra. We were prompted to revisit the MVR when SRA, that
purogava of the 4th varNa, sent us a copy of the shaiva-shAkta text
termed the mahAvidyA-stotraM. He correctly noticed that it might be an
early text with considerable bearing on the emergence of the vana-durgA
system. We agree and feel that its core belongs to that basic old layer
of texts going back to the transitional state (Hopefully at some point
we will return to the discussion of this old layer of texts, including
the mahAvidyA stotra, one of the earliest tAntrika pA\~nchArAtrika
mantra-s known as viShNumAya, the kaumAra and the mAta\~NgI mantra-s of
the aShTA\~Nga saMgraha and kAshyapa saMhitA, mantra-s of the
arthashAstra, and the links to the mantra-s of the uDDIsha tantra
tradition among others).

Many people have an incorrect understanding of the tathAgata. They see
him through the lenses of their own making – a pure philosopher
disinterested in ritual, a proto-Marxist, a social reformer or simply a
saint in the mold of a much later version. But he was in reality quite
different – he saw himself as an insider to the vaidika tradition of the
Arya-s who was redefining its structure, texts and worldview from
within, albeit in a rather radical manner. As part of this activity he
was on one hand a philosopher who debated with his rivals of mImAmsaka
and other parivrAjaka traditions and on the other hand, like them, he
too was mantravAdin. He sought to defeat them not just in philosophical
debates but also emerge as a superior mantra-vAdin with more powerful
mantra-s. This latter aspect is apparent in his battle with the brAhmaNa
uruvela jaTila kAshyapa or the skull-tapping brAhmaNa va\~NgIsha. While
in his subversive philosophy departed even farther from the mainstream
than the muNDaka upaniShat, it is likely that he was more conservative
with his mantrashAstra. While the tathAgata probably subtly tried to
encourage his own worship, in mantra practice for practical gains he
still had to stick to the basics – this is in fact reflected in his
advice to the councilors of the vR^iji gaNarAjya to continue their
rituals as ordained to the deva-s and to the brAhmaNa-s to continue
studying their veda. The MVR, coming early in the Sanskritic tradition
of the tAthAgata-s, is in large part an adaptation of the Astika
mantrashAstra. In this regard it tries to imitate both the
proto-tAntrika as well as the late vaidika systems.

The revelation of the MVR by siddhArtha occurred at the jetavana grove
in the outskirts of shravAsti when he was living in the vihAra built by
his rich patron anAthapiNDaka, in the midst of a vast assembly of
disciples and bodhisattva-s. He had been joined by a new disciple svAti
who decided to procure some wood to fuel the sauna bath of the bhikShu-s
known as the jentAka. While breaking a piece of dry wood a great black
snake emerged and bit the thumb on his right foot. As a result he fell
frothing from the mouth, with eyes rolling inwards and lost
consciousness. Seeing him fallen thus Ananda, the cousin of the
tathAgata, rushed to the buddha and told him about the fate of the young
new bikShu. To revive him tathAgata revealed to Ananda the mantra-s
known as the mahAmAyUrI-vidyA-rAj\~nI.Not only is the MVR notable for
its antiquity among the nAstika tantra-s, but also for its importance in
the context of the spread of the mantrashAstra over Asia. In
translation, the MVR acquired early popularity among the chInAcharya-s
due to the efforts of kumArajIva. Then it went on further to Korea and
Japan. In the west a peculiar phenomenon is observed – fragments of the
MVR were absorbed within the syncretic Abrahamistic-Iranian framework of
a strain of Manichaeism promulgated by the mAr ammO, the student of
mani. Here the yakSha-s of the MVR are invoked in an amusingly eclectic
company with deities such as mani, the Messiah yEsu and a farrago of
other Abrahamistic angels that would certainly impress a modern Hindu
moron svAmI. Not surprisingly, in this tradition mani himself was
considered the bodhisattva maitreya. Thus, texts like the MVR might have
had a key role in the introduction of tAntrika concepts to the Middle
East.

Right in the beginning after the customary invocation of the tathagata,
the saMgha, the dharma, the arhat-s and the bodhisattva-s headed by
maitreya the MVR get to business by providing mantra-s to the actual
deities required for its objectives. For example:

kAli karAli kumbhANDi shaMkhini kamalAkShi harIti harikeshi shrImati
hari haripi\~Ngale laMbe pralaMbe kAlapAshe kAlashodari yamadUti
yamarAkShasi bhUtagrasani pratIchChatha mAM gandhaM puShpaM dhUpaM baliM
cha dAsyAmi rakShatha mama sagaNa-parivArANAM sarva-satvAnAMsh cha
sarva-bhayopadravebhyaH jIvatu varSha-shataM pashyatu sharadA-shataM
sidhyantu me mantrapadAH svAhA ||  
While the 17 female deities invoked in this formula in the typical
Astika pa\~nchopachAra style are considered to be rAkShasi-s by the
nAstika-s, it is clear that they are a primitive form of the system of
17 kAli-s that was to come of its own much later in the kAlikula.

Then further ahead as the tathAgata begins convey the mantra-s to Ananda
we encounter formulae such as:  
rAtrau svasti divA svasti svasti madhyaMdine sthite |  
svasti sarvaM aho-rAtraM sarvabuddhA dishantu me ||

This mantra is a clear example of the nAstika imitation of a vaidika
mantra which is duly termed svastyayana so that it could take the place
of the vaidika svastyayana (Also compare with the pada of the trita
Aptya mantra in RV 10.7.1: svasti no divo agne pR^ithivyA; also note the
inscription of the above nAstika mantra in a blue porcelain jar of the
Xuande period from chIna).

Then after mantra-s to female deities with flourishes of onomatopoeic
low complexity \[e.g. oM (mili + tili + chulu + muhu + mulu+ hu + hulu +
vA + pA + jAla) \* 10\] the tathagata gets on with the worship of
snakes. Here the nAstika-s are drawing from an old template that is seen
in the sarpa-bali of the vaidika tradition (e.g. mantra-s of Apastamba
mantra pATha 2.17). Two prominent sarpa-s that are invoked in the MVR,
dhR^itarAShTra and airAvata are also among the first to be invoked in
the vaidika sarpa-bali. Likewise, another notable sarpa invoked in both
the MVR and the sarpa-bali mantra-s is takShaka. The MVR sarpa section
has a mantra:  
pR^ithivIcharAsh cha ye nAgAs tathaiva jalanishritAH |  
antarIkShacharA ye cha ye cha meru samAshritAH ||

This clearly appears to be a nAstika paraphrase of renowned vaidika
sarpa-bali mantra (or its aitihAsika equivalent in the mahAbhArata):  
namo .astu sarpebhyo ye ke ca pR^ithivIm anu |  
ye antarikShe ye divi tebhyaH sarpebhyo namaH ||  
ye .ado rocane divo ye vA sUryasya rashmiShu |  
yeShAm apsu sadas kR^itaM tebhyaH sarpebhyo namaH ||

The below mantra from the MVR with the ma hiMsi also resembles similar
vaidika formulae including those used in the initial fire ritual of the
sarpa-bali:  
mA me apAdakA hiMsyur mA me hiMsyur dvipAdakAH |  
mA me chatuShpadA hiMsyur mA me hiMsyur bahupAdakAH ||

Furthermore, we could also connect the namaH formulae ending the MVR
sarpa section to the shveta vaidarva namaH formulate at the end of the
sarpa-bali (with the irregularities of nAstika saMskR^ita):  
namo .astu muktAya namo .astu muktaye |  
namo .astu shAntAya namo .astu shAntaye |  
namo vimuktAya namo vimuktaye ||

This is followed by a group of low complexity mantra-s replete with
onomatopoeic excesses that sound more like Gullah of the Carolinas (of
course I mean this in half-jest). These are believed to stem from the
peacock king who lives on the southern side of the Himalayas. Their
possible emergence in the Tamil country is hinted by internal statement
of “drAmiDA mantrapadAH” as well as specifics of the mantra:

ili mitti tili mitti tili mili mitti tili mile mili tili mitti chili
mili mili chili mili mili tili mili sutumbA tumbA suvacha chilikisiya
bhinna meDi namo buddhAnAM chilikisi prAptamUle itihArA lohitamUle tumbA
sutumbA kuTTi kunaTTi tila ku\~nja naTTi aDakavAtyAyAM varShatu devo

samantena nArAyaNi pArAyaNi haritAli kuntAli ili misti kili misti ili
kili misti ili me sidhyantu drAmiDA mantrapadAH svAhA ||

\[elements like kuTTi, aDakavAtyAyAM, aTTe etc could be of Dravidian
origin\]

After more of such mantra-s, the tathagata is said to expound the famous
vidyA of mAta\~NgI. This goddess emerges early in a mantra in the
kAshyapa saMhitA of the medical tradition. Subsequently, she has a long
history in the Astika world as uchChiShTha chaNDAlini, a deity in the
dasha mahAvidyA system and also as the saMgIta-yoginI of the shrIkula
system:  
bale balkale mAta\~Ngi chaNDali puruSha nichi nichi nigauri gandhAri
chaNDAli mAta\~Ngi mAlini hili hili Agati gati gauri gandhAri kauShThikA
vachari vihAri hili hili ku\~Nje svAhA ||  
The phase “gauri gandhAri” also emerges in an early mantra of the
pA\~ncharAtrika-s, the viShNumAyA.

Then the tathAgata is said to launch into an enumeration of the
yakShasenApati-s who govern the various tIrtha-sthala-s of jambudvIpa
and provides one of the early expressions of the sacred geography of
greater India, albeit through a nAstika lens. These yakShasenApati-s are
in large part Astika temples and the specific deities housed in them.
For example: vajrapANi (indra) was housed in a shrine in rAjagR^iha
(Bihar); garuDa in vipula; maheshvara in the kirAta country; bR^ihaspati
in shrAvasti; mahAkAla in vArANasi; viShNu in dvAraka; a famous
kArttikeya shrine in rohitaka and another one of nejameSha at
pA\~NchAla; another indra at vaidisha; there was a lambodara (a
vinAyaka?) in Orissa.

An onomatopoeic mantra attributed to indra from the MVR:  
jalA jantule chApeTi jantule mathani ghaTani grasani hari hari shiri
dyoti shire tataru tataru Nabati siMhA hA hA hA hA hA siMhe dhiti dhiti
kuru kuru shabare vajre jyoti tuTa tuTasi baTa baTasi sili sili kapile
kapilamUle hA hI hUm sarvaduShTa praduShTAnAM jaMbhana karomi
hasta-pAdA\~Nga-nigrahaM karomi saha tridashehi devehi DaTa\~Ngini
surapativarti vajra vajra vajra vajra vajra vajra vajrapataye svAhA ||

One point to note in the MVR is the set of mantra-s known as the daNDa
parihAra mantra-s. These mantra-s invoke yakSha-s in the cardinal
directions and call upon them to remove the daNDa-s bearing upon the
beneficiary. The directional invocation follows an ancient pattern of
mantra-s laid down in the veda wherein deities are invoked in different
direction to protect the yajamAna. But the daNDa parihAra mentioned in
the MVR is specifically related to the mantra-s to ward off the effects
of various divine daNDa-s seen in the vanadurgA tradition and its
precursors. Further the same set of mantra-s also talk about the
performance of “sImAbandhaM” and “dharaNIbandhaM” which are also
paralleled in the mantra-s of the vanadurgA tradition in the form of
elaborate dig-bandha-s.

Another point of note in the MVR is the repelling of various toxins by
means of the weapons of the gods. The structure of this mantra clearly
indicates that it was acquired from the Astika world with superficial
buddhification by adding certain elements:  
\[hataM viShaM nihataM viShaM buddha-tejohataM viShaM
pratyeka-buddha-tejohataM viShaM arhat-tejohataM viShaM
anAgAmi-tejohataM viShaM sakR^id-AgAmi-tejohataM viShaM
srotApanna-tejohataM viShaM satya-vAdi-tejohataM viShaM\]
brahma-daNDa-tejohataM viShaM indra-vajra-tejohataM viShaM
viShNu-chakra-tejohataM viShaM agni-tejohataM viShaM
varuNa-pAsha-tejohataM viShaM asura-mAyA-hataM viShaM nAga-vidyA-hataM
viShaM rudra-shUla-tejohataM viShaM skanda-shakti-tejohataM viShaM
mahAmAyUrI-vidyA-hataM viShaM bhUmyA saMkrAmatu viShaM svastyayanaM
bhavatu ||

The first part is clearly a nAstika header which lists the various
bauddha entities whose luster is invoked to smite the venom, such as: 1)
the buddha; 2) the pratyekabuddha or the self-taught buddha who wanders
like a rhinoceros; 3) the arhat who destroys his bonds to the world and
attains nirvANa upon death; 4) the anAgAmi who will reincarnate in a
pure world and then attain nirvANa; 5) sakR^id-AgAmi who will be born
once more on earth and then attain nirvANa upon death; 6) srotApanna who
has broken three fetters recognized by the nAstika-s. These have been
imposed upon the ancestral mantra that invokes various Astika devatA-s
and their weapons to smite the venom.

Such adaptations of Astika material are rather common in the early
nAstika tAntrika material. One example of interest is the vasudhArA
dhAranI, which the tathAgata is supposed to have expounded as per
mahAyAna tradition in koshAmbi. At its heart it is an adaptation of a
lakShmI sAdhAna padded with a lot of nAstika periphrase:

mUlamantra: OM shriye shrIkari svAhA | om dhanakari dhAnyakari
ratna-varShaNi svAhA ||  
sAdhya-mantra: OM vasudhAre svAhA ||  
hR^idayam: OM lakShmyai svAhA ||  
upahR^idayam: OM lakShmI bhUtala-nivAsine svAhA | saM yathA daM OM

indrAya svAhA | yamAya svAhA | varuNAya svAhA | vaishravaNAya svAhA |
digbhyo vidigbhyaH svAhA ||

Here the nAstika retains the typical Astika deva-s to be worshiped in
the cardinal directions rather than deploying the mahArAja-s.

Another later example is seen in the
Arya-sarva-tathAgatoShNISha-sitAta-patrA-nAmaparAjitA pratya\~NgirA:  
namo loke arhatAnAm | namaH srotApannAnAm | namaH sakR^id-AgAminAm |
namo anAgAminAm | namo loke samyag-gatAnAm | namaH samyak-pratipannAnAm
| namo devarShINAm | namo deva-brahmaNe | namo buddhAya | namo bhagavate
rudrAya umA-sahitAya | namo varuNAya | namo bhagavate nArAyaNAya |
mahA-pa\~ncha-mudrA namaH namaskR^itAya | namo bhagavate
nandikeshvara-mahAkAlAya | tripura-nagara-vidrAvaNa-karAya|
avimuktika-kashmIra-mahA-shmashAna-nivAsitAya | namo
mAtR^i-gaNa-sahitAya | 

Here the nAstika mixes in the Astika devatA-s rudra, varuNa, nArAyaNa
and specifically adapts a number of shaiva elements such as the pair of
nandikeshvara and mahAkAla and also the epithets of rudra such as the
destroyer of the tripura-s, the one who lives in the great graveyards of
Kashi and Kashmir and one accompanied by the hosts of matR^i-s. Thus,
the above examples show how the MVR and related nAstika material
displays an early phase of recycling of Astika material that continues
along similar lines in the later phases of the nAstika development.
Further, in addition to the devatA-s, we have several other elements of
the Astika ‘pantheon’ also liberally incorporated in the MVR such as
mAtR^ikA-s, R^iShi-s, pishAchI-s, rAkShasI-s and the like. In fact, the
MVR list might be considered a survival of a relatively early version of
a mAtR^ikA list from which the sapta-/aShTa- mAtR^ikA list crystallized.
The MVR list, explicitly described as dvAdasha mAtaraH, goes thus:

brAhmI raudrI kaumArI vaiShNavI aindrI vArAhI kauverI vAruNI yAmyA
vAyuvyA AgneyI mahAkAlI cheti |

We observe that the great epic and its appendix (including the
AryA-stava-s and the accounts of ekAnaMshA) do not mention the 7/8
mAtaraH at all. This clearly suggests that as a defined group they
emerged after the mahAbhArata and harivaMsha. However, it should be
noted that the mahAbhArata has long lists of mAtR^ikA-s associated with
skanda. Another list of 13 mAtR^ikA-s are mentioned in a gR^ihya ritual
promulgated by the gobhila dharmashAstra of the sAmaveda tradition
(1.11-12). Finally, we have an old list of goddess invoked in the ritual
to the gnA-s and patnI-s in fr R^igveda:

uta gnA vyantu devapatnIr indrANy agnAyy ashvinI rAT |  
A rodasI varuNAnI shR^iNotu vyantu devIr ya R^itur janInAm || (RV
5.46.8); See also (RV 1.22.12).

In the above mantra, the goddesses indrANi, agnAyi, ashvinI, rAT, rodasI
(the wife of the marut-s) and varuNAnI are invoked. Thus, various lists
of mAtaraH, especially as female versions of the deva-s, have a long
tradition in the Hindu world going back to the RV itself. The MVR
appears to preserve one such list that was current in the post-Vedic
period but prior to the crystallization of the Pauranic 7/8 list. The
MVR list includes, in addition to the female forms of the usual vedic
deva-s, those of the trinity, kubera, kumAra and importantly varAha’s
shakti as a distinct mAtR^i. In this respect it marks a step towards the
emergence of the 7/8 mAtR^ikA list. It is from such a list, we suspect,
that the 7/8 mAtR^ikA list arose by recombining the concept of the list
of goddess with another old concept, i.e. the specific group of 7
goddesses. This latter concept is also is also seen multiply in the RV,
e.g.:

sapta svasAro abhi mAtaraH shishuM navaM jaGYAnaM jenyaM vipashchitam |
RV 9.86.36ab

Beyond the veda, this group of seven sister goddesses had a pervasive
presence throughout jambudvIpa in the form of the sapta bhagini cult
amongst others. By addition of the primary trans-functional
Indo-European goddess to the group of 7 we get the typical number 8. The
remaining 7 were then filled up with the goddess drawn from a list like
that in the MVR as per their primacy in the Pauranic pantheon. Thus we
get: the trans-functional goddess 1) chaNDikA/mahAlakShmI; the female
forms of the trinity: 2) raudrI 3) vaiShNavI 4) brAhmI; the female form
of kumAra: 5) kaumArI; the only representative from the old Vedic list,
the female form of indra: 6)aindrI; the distinctive female deities
emerging in list like that in the MVR: 7) vArAhI 8) chAmuNDA
(=mAhAkAlI).

Another point of note in the MVR is the invocation of nakShatra-s. This
pattern continues a tradition, which, as we have seen before, began in
the vedic ritual of the nakShatreShTi. Thus, the tAthAgata-s have
composed rough parallels to the nakShatra sUkta-s in their mantra
material:  
kR^ittikA rohiNI chaiva mR^igashirArdrA punarvasuH |  
puShyo ma\~Ngala-saMpanno .ashleShA bhavati saptamI ||  
ity ete sapta-nakShatrAH pUrva-dvArikAsthitAH|  
ye pUrvAM dishaM rakShanti paripAlayanti ||

Interestingly, a parallel nakShatra-sUkta was transmitted to the
Mongols. In the ruins of the Olon Sueme site in Inner Mongolia (now
aggrandized by the chIna-s) we find fragments of such hymns. An example
translated from Mongolian by Walther Heissig:  
Golden Suendi, who makes a single man into a hundred men …;  
Star Buravabadara, who makes of one mare a thousand mares…;  
Star Aslis, who makes a simple sheep into a thousand white sheep…;  
Star Urukini, who makes a single head of cattle into a hundred red
cattle…;  
Star Aburad, who makes one single camel into ten black camels …;  
Star Raradi, who from one vegetable makes nine fields…;  
Star Molbar, who makes a poor man into a rich one ….

From behind the Mongolian we see faint echoes of their Indo-Aryan
origin: Buravabadara= pUrva-bhadra/proShTa-pAda; Aslis= ashleSha;
Aburad= amburAT (shatabhiShak?). This is also supported by the Mongol
myth that the name of the mountain on which the polestar is anchored is
supposed to be sumeru.

We finally come to two general issues raised by the MVR. The first of
these is regarding the name itself – why is this venom-countering vidyA
named after a peahen deity. In jambudvIpa, which abounds in venomous
organisms, it has been long observed that several birds make a meal of
these very venom producers. Of these the birds that are well-known to
kill and feed on snakes and poisonous arthropods are the peacock and the
crested serpent eagle. Not surprisingly both of them provide archetypes
for the deities that are invoked to counter venom – mahAmayUrI and
garuDa. The former has a long history in this regard that goes back to
the sUkta-s of the RV and AV:  
triH sapta mayUryaH sapta svasAro agruvaH |  
tAste viShaM vi jabhrira udakaM kumbhinIriva || (RV 1.191.14)

Here not just the 21 peahens but also the 7 sister goddess are invoked
to neutralize the venom. We believe that there is more to this mantra
than meets the eye in the obvious sense.

adanti tvA pipIlikA vi vR^ishchanti mayUryaH |  
sarve bhala bravAtha shArkoTam arasaM viSham || (AV-vulgate 7.56.7)

mayUro .atra vR^ishchikaM mayUraM vayaM vidmasi |  
taM pari parijambhanaM vR^ishchika jambhanam asi || (AV-P 19.47.2)

yas tanuH pR^ithur vINA vadha iva prasarpati |  
mayUraH kila te viShaM kR^ikavAkush cha jakShatu || (AV-P 20.38.3)

Here peahens (and ants in the first verse) are invoked to render the
venom ineffectual or eat up either of two different kinds of scorpions,
the sharkoTa and the vR^ishchika. In the last verse the peacock is
invoked along with the Grey junglefowl to consume the poison.

Thus, the MVR preserves a post-Vedic layer of the long tradition of
venom-countering vidyA-s that originated in the vedic period. This
poison-countering mayUrI tradition (including other fowl, like the Grey
junglefowl mention in the AV mantra) appears to have existed parallel to
the more famous garuDa tradition. It is in this regard it may be noted
that a mantra of ekAnaMshA from the barbarIkopAkhyAna (skanda
mahApurANa) contains the epithet mahAmayUrI. Hence, we posit that behind
the nAstika façade the MVR is at its core a text of the mayUrI tradition
that was prevalent until around the 300s of the CE in Greater India.
Early on the mayUrI tradition underwent syncreticism with the kaumAra
tradition. Perhaps the roots for this connection go back its Vedic
antecedents via the link to the seven sisters, who in their new number
six reappear in the kaumAra system. In any case the peacock was taken up
as the vehicle (mayUravAhana) and the Grey jungle fowl or its relative
the Red fowl as the banner of kumAra (kR^ikavAku-dhvaja or
kukkuTa-dhvaja) from the earliest layers of the kaumAra-shAsana. Indeed,
this link is also seen in the nAstika mahAmAyurI deities as in male or
female form their iconography is rather close to that of kumAra or
kaumArI.

The second general issue is the geographic/ethnonym-based nature of
deity names found in the MVR. The same names are also encountered in
several Astika mantra-s:  
gandhArI (from what is today Afghanistan); gaurI (from the Himalayas);
drAviDI/ drAmiDI (from the Tamil country); shabarI/parNa-shabarI/
atharva-shabarI (from the forest of shabara tribes or the leaf-shabari);
jAMgulI (from the jungle); mAta\~NgI (from the elephants); chaNDAlI
(from the outcastes). Such names have been interpreted in a very literal
sense by several white indologists and their imitators. They have gone
as far as to say that the mantra-shAstra originated from Dravidians, or
due to western influence filtering through Afghanistan or from the
“oppressed” forest tribes whose lands and holy spots were being
“appropriated” by the “rapine” Hindus or that the outcastes like the
chaNDAla-s were the pioneers of the tantra. Certainly both Astika and
nAstika mantra-s have incorporated few elements of provincial languages
like Tamil over the ages (as noted above). However, the above
interpretations entirely miss the spirit of these words and deity names
in the mantra-s. In fact, we may conclude that some of these white
indologists and their shishya-s were specifically aiming at downgrading
the mainstream Indo-Aryan culture and attempting to deny its creativity
and accommodativeness by these claims. In reality we may observe that in
the yajurveda itself we have rudra as being described as associated with
various distant tribes such as niShAda-s, pu\~njiShTha-s (tribal
hunters) and other rapine tribes in the shatarudrIya. In the atharvaveda
we have the discovery of new medicinal herbs being associated with
forest tribes. So when these tribes are mentioned it is to illustrate
the inclusive presence of a particular deity even in untamed zones
beyond the “high civilization”. Since these tribes might discover
medicinal plants in the forest, they have a close association with the
antidotes for poisons providing the archetypes for deities like
mAta\~NgI, the various shabarI-s and jaMgulI who specialize in
countering poison and curing disease. It should be noted that the deity
atharva-shabarI is specifically derived from the archetype of the tribal
girl (a kairAtikA kumAri) from a mountainous region, who is described as
discovering medicinal substances in the atharvaveda:

kairAtikA kumArikA sakA khanati bheShajam |  
hiraNyayIbhir abhribhir girInAm upa sAnuShu || AV-vulgate 10.4.14= AV-P
16.16.4

So it is not the origin of mantra-shAstra from the tribals, rather
imagery of tribal elements providing archetypes for the Indo-Aryans in
their mantra shAstra. However, it is quite clear that as the tribes and
the Indo-Aryans interacted with regard to trade of forest products the
former to acquired elements of the mantra-shAstra and develop their own
imitations of it. In terms of the toponymic deity names, such as drAviDI
and gandhArI the main objective is to capture the sacred geography of
Greater India – both to indicate that a deity is present all over this
region and also to specify that the deity is worshiped, perhaps in
specific shrines, even in the border-zones (Afghanistan in the North and
the Tamil country in the south) that are distant from the “middle
country”. Such toponymic descriptions of deities might also be observed
in the fire hymns of the Mongols where the fire is invoked as the one
which is worshiped in India or in China.
