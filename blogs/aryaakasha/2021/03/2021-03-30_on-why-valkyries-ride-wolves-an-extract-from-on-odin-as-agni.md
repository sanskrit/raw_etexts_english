\[Author’s Note: there are two salient occurrences which I can think of
off-hand for Wolf-Riding female figures in the Nordic sphere. The
Valkyries, and Hyrrokkin. In both cases, we could fairly extrapolate
that there is something of a ‘Psychopomp’ role entailed here – the Wolf
being correlate with the receiving, escorting, and journey of the soul
of the departed (well, at that stage – the depart*ing*). So of course,
the question becomes … is there a broader Indo-European, or at least
Nordic typology to which this adheres? Enter my excerpt …

\[-C.A.R.\] \]

A further Ynglinga Saga saliency may perhaps be found in the accounting
of the fate of King Olaf –

“The Swedes took it amiss that Olaf was sparing in his sacrifices, and
believed the dear times must proceed from this cause. The Swedes
therefore gathered together troops, made an expedition against King
Olaf, surrounded his house and burnt him in it, giving him to Odin as a
sacrifice for good crops. \[…\]”  
“The temple wolf, by the lake shores,  
The corpse of Olaf now devours.  
The clearer of the forests died  
At Odin’s shrine by the lake side.  
The glowing flames stripped to the skin  
The royal robes from the Swedes’ king.  
Thus Olaf, famed in days of yore,  
Vanished from earth at Venner’s shore.”

Now there are a number of ways in which this could be read in light of
our reconstructive typology. One is that it is simply the account of a
pagan nobleman’s funeral – except presented as evidence of the barbarity
of the heathen religion (i.e. due to the perceived lack of sacrifices to
guarantee the fertility of the land, even though it is overpopulation
which is responsible for the famine per Sturluson’s account, the Swedes
had killed the king to offer *him* as the sacrifice instead). Another is
that this is, indeed, a largely accurate rendition of that which had
happened – and the standard sacrificial rite to the Sky Father to ensure
the fertility of the land (which I looked at in “The Queen Of Serpents –
The Serpentine Form Of The Indo-European Earth Mother”) had indeed gone
unperformed by the King up until he became the main element in its
eventual, fiery, completion.

For our purposes, it is enough to note that not only is this yet another
fundamental proof for Odin as Sky Father (i.e. the God propitiated for
the fertility of the land just as we find in the Vedic understanding for
Him), but that this again has intriguing resonancies for those
aforementioned Vedic presentations to the Flame of the Funerary and
Offering Pyres. A “Temple Wolf” is how Odin is described here – directly
akin to the “Kravya” term utilized to refer to the ‘Devouring’ head of
Agni which consumes the flesh thusly offered, especially within the
funerary pyre (c.f several occurrences of this theonym in RV X 16).
Kravya, for us, means also “Wolf” (it is cognate with “Carnivore”) – and
in one of the utilizations of this term in RV X 16 (line 11), it is not
impossible that the term “Kravya-Vahana” has been understood not so much
in the sense of the “Flesh-Conveyor” but rather as the “Flesh-eating
Animal” \[‘Vahana’ can also mean a steed or a mount\] and therefore the
“Wolf” of the “Temple” also referred to as “Odin’s Shrine”.

This notion of a ‘Wolf-Vahana’, however, is most prominently attested in
the Nordic mythology instead as something of a ‘delegated role’ – as the
Valkyries are stated to ride. Something that would most certainly keep
with the metempsychotic or transmigratory role of the Funerary Pyre for
Agni, even if it is not Agni directly and in person taking charge of
these acts of conveyancing in that portion of the Nordic understanding.
Perhaps the understanding is the result of the female followers of the
Great God in question, that are often quite lethal to mortals (c.f the
Maenads and the Ash-Nymphs of Dionysus, and also the intriguing Varoti
\[‘Vata-Putri’ – Daughters of Vata(-Vayu)\] of the Kalash).

I would also surmise that part of what is being related in the
Gylfaginning pertaining to the funerary vessel of Baldr also reflects
this understanding – there, a certain Hyrrokkin (a name whose root is
that of Flame) comes mounted upon a truly formidable wolf; summoned to
dispatch the ship of Baldr out to sea – as it could not be moved (i.e.
Baldr could not be properly dispatched on across the ocean (as liminal
space between the worlds) upon the requisite conveyance-vessel – an
understanding also found in the Vedas) in the absence of the Fire.
Hyrrokkin’s push for the ship instantly causes it to not only be
dispatched out onto the ocean – but the frictional movement of the ship
upon its rollers causes it to burst immediately into flame (recall the
rubbing of sticks to produce the sacral fire in the Vedic conceptr). The
Wolf, meanwhile, that Hyrrokkin had ridden in upon is subdued at the
behest of Odin – something that may accord with the Vedic conceptry for
the ‘Kravya’ becoming subdued so that the other facing of Agni may
instead be invoked \[as seen in RV X 16\].
