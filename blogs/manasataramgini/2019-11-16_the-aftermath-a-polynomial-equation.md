title = "The aftermath: A polynomial equation"

+++
This is merely the tailpiece to the last tale of the strange hauntings.
A reader may wonder why expend so many words on a high school problem.
While the ball could have fitted into the socket, it rolled away.

-----

As Jhilleeka was playing with her nephew upon Vidrum and Kalakausha’s
departure with the blue bottle she remarked to Somakhya: “Do you know I
had a peculiar little encounter with Hemling as a delayed aftermath to
his sliming by the kauṇapa?”  
S: “Lootika was once pretty angry and rough with him when we were in
college — he apparently came after you — does it relate to that? I must
say though that while Hemling had his quirks, I hardly think he was a
guy of harmful intent. He had genuine fascination for cracking
mathematical questions.”  
Jhilli: “Indeed. But I think he also had a strange competitive streak
though he likely meant no malice. At the face of it, it seemed he just
wanted to test me with an interesting problem as he remained in
disbelief for years that I solved the one he lobbed at our house in the
talent show.”  
Lootika: “May be he might have not intended anything inappropriate but
at that time I thought he was going out of the way to court Jhilli’s
attention and that’s what prompted my response.”  
Somakhya: “What exactly happened and what was the interesting
problem?”  
J: “It was some problem on a series sum or something — I have it
recorded in my collection of interesting results and will pull it out.
It happened when you all were in the university.”  
Lootika: “Yes, Hemling would sit in some common courses with us.”

J: “Varoli was in college too and it was the year when I used ride home
alone from school. One day while returning home from school I stopped my
bike to let a herd of milch-buffaloes rampaging like a procession of
Yamadūta-s to clear the road. As I was waiting, Hemling came up to me
suddenly out of nowhere and asked me whether I really solved his problem
by myself at the talent competition years ago. The suddenness with which
he came upon me startled me enough that I whipped out the pepper from my
bag and might have sprayed him had my reaction been quicker. But I
recognized that he was your classmate and former schoolmate Hemling. He
seemed scared but seeing me pause, he stated without any further
explanation that it would have been impossible for a girl that age to
have known calculus. I told him off saying something like what I know or
not know was none of his business. He continued unfazed saying that he
wanted to test me with a problem and if I solved it he would be ‘full of
admiration’ for me. I again told him off that I did not need his
admiration but would take his problem nevertheless.”  
Lootika: “No doubt he was mathematically gifted, but it was a bit too
much to just accost a much younger girl that way.”

Jhilleeka then dug out the problem from her collection: “Here it is\! He
asked me this; given the polynomial equation,

![1+2x+3x^2+...nx^{n-1}=n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2B2x%2B3x%5E2%2B...nx%5E%7Bn-1%7D%3Dn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1+2x+3x^2+...nx^{n-1}=n^2")

Show that one of its roots will always be real and rational. Provide a
closed expression for that root.

Somakhya took the problem from Jhilli and looked at it: “Indeed it
amounts to evaluation of a sum of a series with both geometric and
arithmetic features.”  
J: “I told him I could not solve it right away but will take it home and
work on it. He was bothered that I will ask Lootika for the answer and
cheat. A touch irritated I told him something like I was too conscious
of my own abilities to ask her. Anyhow, here is my solution that I
arrived at after spending sometime on it that evening.

We can evaluate the sum in the
![L.H.S](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L.H.S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"L.H.S") of the given equation thus:

![\\displaystyle S=1+2x+3x^2...(n-1)x^{n-2}+nx^{n-1}\\\\\[10pt\] xS=
x+2x^2+3x^3...(n-1)x^{n-1}+nx^{n}\\\\\[10pt\]
xS-S=nx^{n}-1-x-x^2-x^3...-x^{n-1}\\\\\[10pt\]
S(x-1)=nx^{n}-\\sum\_{k=1}^{n}x^{k-1} = nx^n- \\dfrac{x^n-1}{x-1}=
\\dfrac{nx^{n+1}-nx^n-x^n+1}{x-1}\\\\\[10pt\] \\therefore S=
\\dfrac{nx^{n+1}-nx^n-x^n+1}{(x-1)^2}=
\\dfrac{(nx-n-1)x^n+1}{(x-1)^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+S%3D1%2B2x%2B3x%5E2...%28n-1%29x%5E%7Bn-2%7D%2Bnx%5E%7Bn-1%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+xS%3D+x%2B2x%5E2%2B3x%5E3...%28n-1%29x%5E%7Bn-1%7D%2Bnx%5E%7Bn%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+xS-S%3Dnx%5E%7Bn%7D-1-x-x%5E2-x%5E3...-x%5E%7Bn-1%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+S%28x-1%29%3Dnx%5E%7Bn%7D-%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7Dx%5E%7Bk-1%7D+%3D+nx%5En-+%5Cdfrac%7Bx%5En-1%7D%7Bx-1%7D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bnx%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D-nx%5En-x%5En%2B1%7D%7Bx-1%7D%5C%5C%5B10pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+S%3D+%5Cdfrac%7Bnx%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D-nx%5En-x%5En%2B1%7D%7B%28x-1%29%5E2%7D%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B%28nx-n-1%29x%5En%2B1%7D%7B%28x-1%29%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle S=1+2x+3x^2...(n-1)x^{n-2}+nx^{n-1}\\\\[10pt] xS= x+2x^2+3x^3...(n-1)x^{n-1}+nx^{n}\\\\[10pt] xS-S=nx^{n}-1-x-x^2-x^3...-x^{n-1}\\\\[10pt] S(x-1)=nx^{n}-\\sum_{k=1}^{n}x^{k-1} = nx^n- \\dfrac{x^n-1}{x-1}= \\dfrac{nx^{n+1}-nx^n-x^n+1}{x-1}\\\\[10pt] \\therefore S= \\dfrac{nx^{n+1}-nx^n-x^n+1}{(x-1)^2}= \\dfrac{(nx-n-1)x^n+1}{(x-1)^2}")

We see that,  
if ![n=2;
1+2x=4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2%3B+1%2B2x%3D4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=2; 1+2x=4") we get a rational root
![x=1\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=1\\tfrac{1}{2}")  
if ![n=3;
1+2x+3x^2=9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D3%3B+1%2B2x%2B3x%5E2%3D9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=3; 1+2x+3x^2=9") get a rational root
![x=1\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=1\\tfrac{1}{3}")  
if ![n=4;
1+2x+3x^2+4x^3=16](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D4%3B+1%2B2x%2B3x%5E2%2B4x%5E3%3D16&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=4; 1+2x+3x^2+4x^3=16") get a rational root
![x=1\\tfrac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=1\\tfrac{1}{4}")

This tells us that the rational root might take the form
![1\\tfrac{1}{n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1\\tfrac{1}{n}"). Substituting
![x=1\\tfrac{1}{n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D1%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=1\\tfrac{1}{n}") in the sum
![S](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "S") we
see that is indeed the case
![\_{...\\blacksquare}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=_%7B...%5Cblacksquare%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"_{...\\blacksquare}")

Thus,
![n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n^2") is the only power of
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
for which that sum will yield a polynomial equation from such a sum with
a rational root for every
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n").
Thus, we get the sum:

![\\displaystyle \\sum\_{k=1}^{n} k \\left(
1+\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right)^{k-1}=n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+k+%5Cleft%28+1%2B%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Cright%29%5E%7Bk-1%7D%3Dn%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k \\left( 1+\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right)^{k-1}=n^2")

Hemling asked agrajā the next day if I had asked her help for a math
problem and whether she had taught me calculus. Lootika did not know
what he was talking about but was primed that he was up to something.
Evidently, he wanted to catch me that evening and see if I had solved it
but I reached home before he could intercept me. It seems he trailed
Lootika and Vrishchika and figured out where we lived. He evidently hung
around for sometime and made the foolish mistake of asking them if I was
around when the two went out to play. Bristling like cats which have
fluffed up their fur for an attack my sisters yelled at Hemling
threatened him of deep trouble if he ever asked about me again. Being
only a gaṇitaśūra and otherwise quite a skittish guy, Hemling fled never
to come our way again.

Lootika: “While I think he really had no business tracking you that way,
your sister Vrishchika felt we had been too aggressive and apologized to
him.”  
J: But now comes the strange part. Just after you’ll left home Varoli
and I one day pried out a folded piece of paper that was inserted
between two stones in the compound wall of our house. On it was a
solution to the same problem in green ink. I suspect it was left there
by Hemling because it had solution using calculus — I sometimes wonder
if that’s how he believed it could be solved. Here is a picture of it:

![\\displaystyle S=1+2x+3x^2...(n-1)x^{n-2}+nx^{n-1} \\\\\[10pt\] \\int
Sdx = \\int \\left(1+2x+3x^2+...(n-1)x^{x-2}+nx^{n-1}\\right)
dx\\\\\[10pt\] =
x+x^2+x^3+x^{n-1}+x^n=\\dfrac{x^{n+1}+x}{x-1}\\\\\[10pt\] \\therefore S=
\\dfrac{d}{dx} \\left( \\dfrac{x^{n+1}+x}{x-1} \\right) =
\\dfrac{(nx-n-1)x^n+1}{(x-1)^2}
