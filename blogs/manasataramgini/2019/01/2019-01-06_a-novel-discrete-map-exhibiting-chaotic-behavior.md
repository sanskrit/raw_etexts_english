title = "A novel discrete map exhibiting chaotic behavior"

+++
The map proposed by R. Lozi over 40 years ago is one of the simplest two
dimensional maps that exhibits chaotic behavior and generates a wide
range of interesting structures. The map may be defined thus:

![x\_{n+1}=1-a\_1|x\_n|+y\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D1-a_1%7Cx_n%7C%2By_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=1-a_1|x_n|+y_n")  
![y\_{n+1}=a\_2x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Da_2x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y_{n+1}=a_2x_n")  
where ![a\_1,
a\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1, a_2") are real parameters.

We have discussed our explorations of this map at some length
[before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/some-reminiscences-of-our-study-of-chaotic-maps-2/).
At that point we also discussed our discovery of certain
[generalizations](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/09/26/some-simple-maps-specifying-strange-attractors/)
of this class of maps. In course of the quest for the generalized
[Lozi-like
maps](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/deliberations-on-richness-and-beauty-discovery-of-some-multi-parameter-iterative-maps/),
we discovered another generalization remarkable for the diversity of
forms it produced. We held back from presenting it because we wished to
investigate its geometry further. As a result we are now able to explain
the basic geometric determinants of the map; however, there are other
aspects that still remain mysterious to us. Hence, we are presenting
this map with whatever understanding we could arrive at along with the
issues that are still open questions for us. They are maps of great
beauty; hence, they are also worth beholding for the sake of their
aesthetics.

This map is defined thus:  
![x\_{n+1}=a\_1+a\_2x\_n+a\_3|x\_n|+y\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Da_1%2Ba_2x_n%2Ba_3%7Cx_n%7C%2By_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=a_1+a_2x_n+a_3|x_n|+y_n")  
![y\_{n+1}=
a\_4-x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+a_4-x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y_{n+1}= a_4-x_n")

Alternatively, we can also define it as:  
![x\_{n+1}=a\_1+a\_2x\_n+a\_3|x\_n|-y\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Da_1%2Ba_2x_n%2Ba_3%7Cx_n%7C-y_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=a_1+a_2x_n+a_3|x_n|-y_n")  
![y\_{n+1}=
a\_4+x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D+a_4%2Bx_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y_{n+1}= a_4+x_n")

Here ![a\_1, a\_2, a\_3,
a\_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4") are real parameters: ![a\_2 +
a\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2+%2B+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_2 + a_3") is in the range
![(-2,2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-2%2C2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(-2,2)") (see below for explanation), while we explored ![a\_1,
a\_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1, a_4") primarily in range ![(-1.01,
1.01)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-1.01%2C+1.01%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(-1.01, 1.01)") as this is the range where there is higher tendency for
the map to yield chaotic attractors. If we take the first definition
then the map is bilaterally symmetric about the axial line
![y=-x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3D-x&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=-x"). It we take the second definition it is similarly symmetric
about the axis
![y=x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"y=x"). For the below discussion we refer only to the first definition
because the second one shows comparable behavior with change in signs of
some of the parameters.

To explore the basic geometric principles behind the attractors
generated by this map we started with a set of 200 equally spaced
starting points ![x\_0,
y\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_0, y_0") all of which lie on the circle ![x=\\cos(t),
y=\\sin(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%5Ccos%28t%29%2C+y%3D%5Csin%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=\\cos(t), y=\\sin(t)"). With each starting point the map was iterated
2000 times. Then the evolution of each starting point under the map was
plotted in one of 11 different colors. We were able to determine the
following rules for the structure of these attractors:

1\) The most important determinant of the geometry of the attractor is
sum of the parameters ![a\_2,
a\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_2, a_3"). When ![a\_1,
a\_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1, a_4") are closer to 1 and ![a\_2+a\_3 \\rightarrow
2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2Ba_3+%5Crightarrow+2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_2+a_3 \\rightarrow 2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)") where
![p,q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2Cq&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p,q") are mutually prime integers, we get a p-ad structure in the
attractor (e.g. Figure 1).

"a_2, a_3")

In Figure 1,
![a\_1=a\_4=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%3Da_4%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

a\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_2, a_3") takes successively, by row, the following 4 pairs of values
(-0.5450419, 0.1); (-0.2450419; -0.2); (-0.7450419, 0.3); (-0.9450419;
0.5) . In each case ![a\_2+a\_3 \\rightarrow
2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{7/2}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2Ba_3+%5Crightarrow+2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B7%2F2%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_2+a_3 \\rightarrow 2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{7/2}\\right)"). This
determines the central heptad structure but the rest of the attractor
shows considerable variability that cannot be explained in a
straightforward way from these parameters.

If ![a\_2 \\rightarrow
0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2+%5Crightarrow+0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_2 \\rightarrow 0") and ![a\_3 \\rightarrow

"a_3 \\rightarrow 2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)") then there
is greater tolerance for the range of values ![a\_1,
a\_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1, a_4") can take.

"a_3=2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{9/2}\\right)") we get a nonad structure
even though
![a\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1") is relatively low.

When ![a\_1 \\rightarrow

"a_2+a_3 \\rightarrow 2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)") the
p-ad structure in the attractor tends to be retained (Figure 3).

![a\_2+a\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2Ba_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

"2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{7/2}\\right)"); thus, we get a core with a
heptad structure.

Irrespective of ![a\_1,

then we get square structure in the core of the attractor (Figure 4).

"a_2+a_3 \\rightarrow 2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)") we see
a loss of the p-ad structure or a flattening of the attractor along the
axis of symmetry from the top left side (Figure 5).

panel ![a\_1=

"a_1= a_4=1") and the expected pentad structure is retained. In the
right panel
![a\_1=a\_4=0.1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%3Da_4%3D0.1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1=a_4=0.1"); we notice that the pentad structure has been lost with
flattening along the axis of symmetry.

These are the basic rules by which the core structure of the attractors
can be accounted for. The parameters ![a\_1,
a\_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1, a_4") can be seen as scaling parameters whereas ![a\_2,
a\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_2, a_3") can be seen as rotational parameters. The latter pair sets
up the rotational structure based on how close their sum approaches
![2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)"). This is the cosine
principle that occurs as the primary structure-determinant in other
chaotic maps, including maps which we discovered and discussed before
([1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/08/05/the-geometric-principles-behind-discrete-dynamical-systems-based-on-the-generalized-witch-of-agnesi/),
[2](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/03/25/the-remarkable-behavior-of-a-map-displaying-derived-from-a-simple-model-for-a-biological-conflict/)).
As in the previously discussed cases, this sets the limits of
![a\_2+a\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2Ba_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_2+a_3") as (-2, 2); however, here there is greater scope for
diversity because the cosine principle is distributed over the sum of
two separate parameters. Beyond the cosine principle,n these attractors
exhibit additional features whose origins remain mysterious to us:

1\) For example, In Figure 3 in addition to the core heptad one can see
additional harmonics like a 11-ad, 18-ad and 29-ad structures. What is
the explanation for them? In the previous examples of chaotic maps we
could explain higher harmonics based on other
![\\tfrac{p}{q}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Bp%7D%7Bq%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{p}{q}") whose
![\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7Bp%2Fq%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\cos\\left(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{p/q}\\right)") might lie close to the
primary cosine. However, in this case the 11-ad, the 18-ad and 29-ad
correspond to no such cosines. Hence, their emergence remains a mystery.

2\) Further, there is an effect of the starting ![x\_0,
y\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_0, y_0"), which can result in the appearance of a n-ad structure
independently of the cosine principle (Figure 6).

In both the above cases the four parameters ![a\_1, a\_2, a\_3,
a\_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4") are respectively, -0.567115129642189,
-0.761931293738961, -0.347582505706949, -0.069076271019876. However, the
left panel was initialized with a circle of radius 0.9 and the right
panel was initialized with a circle of radius
![\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{1}{3}"). Only in the second case we see the emergence of a
heptad structure, which cannot be accounted for by the sum of ![a\_2,
a\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_2%2C+a_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_2, a_3"). The role of the starting ![x\_0,
y\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_0, y_0") in generating n-ad structures is another open question.

To further explore the diversity of chaotic attractors within the
above-stated parameter space for the 4 parameters of the map we set up
our code to search for such maps thus:  
1\) We set ![x\_0=0.3\\cos(\\pi/4), y\_0=
0.3\\sin(\\pi/4)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D0.3%5Ccos%28%5Cpi%2F4%29%2C+y_0%3D+0.3%5Csin%28%5Cpi%2F4%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_0=0.3\\cos(\\pi/4), y_0= 0.3\\sin(\\pi/4)") as the starting point.  
2\) We then randomly generated a set of parameters ![a\_1, a\_2, a\_3,
a\_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C+a_2%2C+a_3%2C+a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4") in the range ![(-1.01,
1.01)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-1.01%2C+1.01%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(-1.01, 1.01)").  
3\) For each such set we allowed ![(x\_0,
y\_0)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_0%2C+y_0%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(x_0, y_0)") to evolve for 1000 iterations under the map. If the
evolution resulted in the divergence to
![\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\infty") or convergence to one or few point attractors, then we
discarded those parameters.  
4\) A heuristic for chaos is that very small differences in the initial
conditions can result in very different end results upon evolution under
the map after a certain number of iterations. Hence, for those
parameters which survived the above filters we tested if a second
![x\_0,
y\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_0, y_0"), which differed from the first by
![10^{-7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B-7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"10^{-7}") in each coordinate diverged from the evolutionary path of the
original ![x\_0,
y\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%2C+y_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_0, y_0") after the same number of iterations. If it did so, the
parameter set was retained as it was the sign of being on a chaotic
attractor.  
5\) These surviving parameter sets were then explored more fully by
studying the evolution of 200 equally spaced points on the circle
![x=0.3\\cos(t),
y=0.3\\sin(t)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0.3%5Ccos%28t%29%2C+y%3D0.3%5Csin%28t%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=0.3\\cos(t), y=0.3\\sin(t)") for 2000 iterations of the map.

We present below few examples of attractors emerging from the above
procedure with parameters listed in order from
![a\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_1") to
![a\_4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_4&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_4").

This attractor assumes of the form reminiscent in some ways of the
gingerbread man seen in the classical Lozi attractor. The gingerbread
man has a “heart” in the form a five-lobed structure with a ellipse
within it.

This attractor has parallels to the previous one in being somewhat like
the gingerbread man with 4 hands.

This attractor takes the form of a fish or some crustacean naupilus
larva.

This is a representative of a prevalent type of attractor generated by
this map that may be termed the “Sombrero hat” type. The central heptad
structure in this attractor is a mystery because it is not explicable by
the cosine conditions above-presented .

This form of the attractor resembles the [butterfly
attractor](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/12/26/some-reminiscences-of-our-study-of-chaotic-maps-2/)
generated by the square-root modification of the Lozi map that we had
described earlier.

similar at the former value too. It vaguely resembles some Cambrian
animal.

This attractor assumes a bun-shaped morph that is seen quite often under
these maps. An explanation for the multiple harmonics of this attractor
remains as yet mysterious to us.

one accounts for the central pentagonal zone of restriction and the
triad of octagonal restriction zones around it remains mysterious.

pentad surrounded by 9 further pentads. An explanation for the emergence
of these pentads and the 9 fold harmonic however remains elusive.
