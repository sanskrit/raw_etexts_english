## LVIII

*To Dr. Paul Carus*

19 W. 38TH ST.,  
NEW YORK

*June* \[*May*\] *28*, *'95*

DR. PAUL CARUS, LA SALLE, ILL.

DEAR SIR,

I am just now in receipt of your letter and will be very happy to join
the religions Congress at Toronto. Only, as you are well aware of, the
financial means of a "Bhikshu" (A Hindu or Buddhist monk.) are very
limited. I will be only too glad to do anything in my power to help you
and wait further particulars and directions.

Hoping to hear from you soon and thanking you very much for your great
sympathy with Buddhistic India.

I remain ever fraternally your,  
VIVEKANANDA
