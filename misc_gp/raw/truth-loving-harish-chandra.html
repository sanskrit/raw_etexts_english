<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Truth-Loving Hariścandra</p>
<p class="Numbers">1</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Only, God is truth. He is always one and the same and immortal. Truth never changes. The false always changes his version but what can a truthful one change? What is there with him to change? Realise the truth, search out the truth, be firm on what is truth. That knowledge should be based on the śāstras, that should be based on the sayings of saints. Well enough! Only the firmness on it will lead to the attainment of God. Firm resolution is possible only in truth and not in untruth. Fidelity can be to truth only and not in untruth. No person of the world can observe the rule that ‘I will tell a lie only; I will do what is false only;’ because this rule can never be practised in all the three periods (past, present and future). It is impracticable. Contrary to it, it is only truth to speak and truthful deeds can be practised as a rule and it can be adhered also. That is why truth is practical in action and speech and that is the embodiment of God. In the world, untruth gets shelter only behind the veil of truth in action and behaviour. So, truth is only the eternal substance and untruth is ever untruth. It is only the blending of this truth and untruth that has created misery in the universe. The Supreme bliss can be attained by recourse to truth, by giving up untruth. We may face some difficulties in the beginning even; but they will be momentary, in the end truth will triumph forever. There is a long list of such examples in the history of the world and among these examples truth loving Hariścandra’s name can be quoted on priority.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is related to the Tretā age. In those days, Hariścandra of Ichwāku dynasty was the king of Ayodhyā. He was the sole Emperor of the entire earth, he had true steadfastness in righteousness and his repute was spread all over the three worlds. Hariścandra’s name was on the tongue of everyone, all were convinced of his noble behaviour, his charity and truthfulness. The gods were pleased with him, the subjects remained contented in his rule, famine never occurred. Neither anyone suffered from disease nor untimely death occurred to anyone. All the subjects worshipped God and all were totally devoted to their religion. All were wealthy, powerful and austere, but none was arrogant. The king Hariścandra had equal glance on all, and loved everyone without any distinction. He used to perform many YajÛa-sacrifices with philanthropic motive. The distinctive characteristic in him, was that he never deviated from truth. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The seer Vasiṣṭha was his priest. It was the command of Vasiṣṭha according to which, he managed the royal affairs and he had a very high regard for Vasiṣṭha. Once, in a ‘Rājasūya YajÛa’ he donated a very big sacrificial gift to Vasiṣṭha which added to the repute of Vasiṣṭha more. Everyone began to pay him high regard, to this extent that he was offered the special seat even in Indra’s assembly. Vasiṣṭha was worthy from all sides, but because of being the priest of Hariścandra, he was given more regard in Indra’s assembly. In Indra’s assembly besides Vasiṣṭha the other seers like Viśwāmitra, Nārada etc., used to be present and discuss about the matters of even from the Brahmaloka downwards to the nether world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, Indra’s assembly was in progress. The seers, Vasiṣṭha, Viśwāmitra etc., were sitting on one side, gods, demigods, manes and other class of demigods were also occupying their respective seats. Just before Indra, it was the topic of discussion as who was the topmost charity-giver, the supermost virtuous and the outstanding truthful in the mortal world? All were considering over this matter. Vasiṣṭha said—‘In the mortal world, there is the only Hariścandra, my client, such a person. He has performed ‘Rājasūya YajÛa’; and in that YajÛa, he has offered sacrificial fee so much, that is beyond the description in words. There is no one so much truthful, donator, virtuous and keeping his subjects contented and happy. What to say more, I speak from the core of my heart and I speak the truth that a highly virtuous, glorious, donator, and truthful king like Hariścandra has been neither born, nor will be born on the earth.’* The gods—the donation-sharers of the YajÛa, also endorsed Vasiṣṭha’s statement.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">* हरिश्चन्द्रसमो राजा न भूतो न भविष्यति।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">सत्यवादी तथा दाता शूर: परमधार्मिक:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord’s frolicsome plays are wonderful. No one except Him, knows what he wants to get done by whom and when. At that time, the Lord thought to highlight the ideal of Hariścandra’s glory, repute and truthfulness before the world. Enough! It was only the delay of idea merely and He devised a play at once. The feeling that Vasiṣṭha had praised for his self-greatness by reciting the glory of Hariścandra, began to overpower Viśwāmitra’s mind; because, the person whose client was so righteous, must be himself a great righteous and moral. Vasiṣṭha has insulted us and particularly myself by emphasising his own efficacy; because it is I, who is his rival. Due to rivalry, such reasons began to breed in his mind which had no trace in Vasiṣṭha’s mind at all. About Hariścandra, he thought that whence has he become so virtuous as he would not deviate from the truth and righteousness in any difficulty?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the open assembly, Viśwāmitra opposed Vasiṣṭha. He said—‘Vasisṭḥa has stated the greatness of Hariścandra falsely. He dwells with him, eats his meals and sings in his admiration. I know Hariścandra very well, since when did he become virtuous? If he boasts of his mimic performance of virtuousness, I can make him deviate in a moment. What is there special in him?’ The gods said—‘Lord! What are you saying? Is it possible that the assertion of great sage Vasiṣṭha can ever be untrue? We know that Hariścandra is virtuous and righteous of high rank.’ Viśwāmitra said—‘Vasisṭḥa does not give a true picture of Hariścandra, I will prove it. If he wants to bet, he can. If I proved to be true, may his learning till now and the merit of his righteous act and penance be futile, and if he is true and right, then my righteousness and holiness be fruitless.’ Viśwāmitra resolved it himself and went away leaving Indra’s assembly. Considering it God’s will, Vasiṣṭha and Indra etc., also remained silent, They began to think curiously and wait to see the sportful play of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, king Hariścandra was loitering in the forest. He saw at a place that any young female ascetic was weeping shouting in this way—‘protect me, protect me.’ He said from a distance—‘Don’t be afraid, who is doing this unjust act in my ruling period?’ He moved towards her hastily. At that time, the<span class="char-style-override-6">Vighnarāja </span>thought to himself that Viśwāmitra was performing a very severe penance. He wants to take under his sway all the branches of that knowledge, which are not accomplished by the big gods even. These sciences are mournful, being disturbed by the lustre of his penance. Having entered the body of Hariścandra, if I disturb Viśwāmitra’s penance, it can solve the purpose of these sciences. The<span class="char-style-override-6">Vighnarāja </span>entered Hariścandra’s body, Hariścandra reached that female ascetic.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, Hariścandra had been obsessed by evil spirit already. Approaching the female ascetic, he said—‘Who is that sinner who is attaching fire with his wearing clothes? So much courage in my ruling period! Just now, his body will be inflicted by the sharp point of my arrows, he will be doomed to death.’ Just near, Viśwāmitra was practising penance. Hearing the words of Hariścandra, he got furious. Seeing him in anger that female ascetic disappeared and just seeing Viśwāmitra, Hariścandra began to tremble with fear. His anger cooled down. When Viśwāmitra rebuked—‘O the vile! Wait for a moment, just now, I teach you a lesson of your arrogance.’ Hariścandra was bewildered. With a great meekness, touching the feet of the sage he said—‘O the seer! I have not done any fault. It is my moral duty to rush up to protect anyone seeing who is in peril. There are only two moral duties of a king—charity and protection. The third one is only to fight a battle for these at the right time. Consider my situation and circumstances.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being cool, Viśwāmitra said—‘O the king! First, tell me who deserves charity, who deserves shelter and protection and who deserves to be fought?’ Hariścandra said—‘Lord! Brahmans and indigents deserve charity, the frightened one deserves protection and the obstacle creating person in this job deserves to be fought a battle.’ Viśwāmitra said—‘O the king! As you have made your effort for the protection of the frightened, can you donate me the objects in charity also similarly? I want to perform YajÛa, donate me gifts.’ Hariścandra was greatly delighted hearing the words of Viśwāmitra. He said—‘Lord! What should I donate you? Speak without any hesitation and think that I can donate you whatever you want. Ask for anything—gold, son, wife, my life, kingdom, city, property—I am ready to donate all these?’ Viśwāmitra was taken aback seeing this disposition of charity. No word could come out of his mouth. Controlling himself, he said—‘O the king! Whenever I need, I will demand of you. Till then, go to your capital and manage your royal affairs.’ Hariścandra returned therefrom.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After Hariścandra’s departure, Viśwāmitra began to think over that this is the same Hariścandra, who was the sole cause of dispute between Vasiṣṭha and me in Indra’s assembly. Today he abruptly created hindrance in my penance. Being sad with my penance, if the presiding deity of my penance was weeping, she might do so. What was the concern of Hariścandra to it? But suddenly he poked his nose. Even coming before me he declared himself a donator. Now, his charity needs to be tested. Just see! How long does he continue to be a donator? Viśwāmitra began to plan to humiliate Hariścandra. He transformed a demon to a hog and sent him to the capital of Hariścandra. That fierce hog making a loud roar reached the orchard of the king of Ayodhyā. The gardeners got frightened and going in the orchard the hog began to devastate the creepers, the groves of the trees and flowers fearlessly. Many a person attacked on it with arms, but he was not frightened the least; but contrary to it, he began to crush the trees by uprooting them and tumbling them down. When the soldiers there could not flee him out by any means, being helpless, they went to the shelter of Hariścandra. Seeing them helpless, Hariścandra said—‘Brothers! Why are you afraid so much? What fear has overpowered you? Tell me whose death has approached near? How big he is, how vigorous he is, he may be god or devil, I just take him to task.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The gardeners said—‘Lord! Neither he is a devil nor demon, that he is a big hog and he is not the least frightened with our arrows, stones and bamboo-sticks, but on the other side he attacks us so fiercely that we dare not stand before him.’ Hearing the version of the gardeners, Hariścandra, himself mounted on the horse and ordered the soldiers to follow him. The king saw that the entire orchard had been destroyed and that the hog was roaring there. Taking the aim, he shot an arrow at it, but the hog escaped himself from it. At the time of second arrow the hog crossing over Hariścandra, ran away and Hariścandra chased him. For a moment, he appeared before him but next moment he disappeared. Thus, he made the king reach a dense forest. The army was left behind. In that dense forest, Hariścandra was left alone. After a while the hog disappeared and the king got worried.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was the mid of the day, on account of chasing for a long distance, Hariścandra was badly exhausted. It was a scorching sun, he was oppressed by hunger and thirst. He missed the way in the solitary forest, he became helpless. He thought that what to do, where to go, who would help him in that unknown forest? The pathway was unknown, then to which direction he should move on. After a few moments, he saw that just in front of him, there was a river of limpid water flowing, there were charming trees on its bank,  and that was the most suitable place for him to rest. He got down from the horse, made the horse drink the water, and tying it to a tree, he drank the water himself. After taking rest, he made up his mind to go to his capital, but the question was how to go, to which direction to move on, he was confused about the directions.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the same time, the sage, Viśwāmitra disguised as an old Brāhmaṇa reached before him. The king loved to him. After blessing him, the old Brāhmaṇa said to him—‘Your majesty! How did you come here in such a deserted dense forest? What do you want to do here all alone? Being steady of mind, tell me all about.’ The king narrated the entire story and said that he was quite unknown to the way to his capital. Kindly, guide me the way. I am fortunate enough to have you here, otherwise I would have remained going astray in this forest? If you have desire of wealth, if you want to perform any YajÛa, then visit Ayodhyā, I will donate a lot of wealth to you.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of Hariścandra, that old Brāhmaṇa expressed great happiness. Smiling he said—‘O the king! This is a great holy pilgrimage. By bathing in this river, and offering water to the ancestors, even the biggest sins are washed away. It is a very opportune moment, holy place and I am a Brāhmaṇa worthy of charity. So, after taking bath, donate the gift to me, this Brāhmaṇa. Manu, himself, has stated that one who does not take a bath even on visiting a holy pilgrimage, is suicidal. Being pleased with your charity, I will guide you the way to the capital and make you reach there and thus, I will help you too much.’ Having faith in the beguiling speech of the hermit, Hariścandra bathed in that illusory river. Just after bathing, Hariścandra’s mind changed, he became completely under the Viśwāmitra’s sway. Viśwāmitra’s spell worked fully on Hariścandra.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king said—‘Lord! Demand whatever you want. Cows, land, gold, elephant, horses—whatever you wish, you can demand. I have no such possession that I cannot donate you.’ Viśwāmitra, disguised as an old Brāhmaṇa, said—‘O the king! I have heard of your great repute in the world. The sage Vasiṣṭha himself has said that no one on the earth is equal to Hariścandra in the act of charity. He has gone even to the extent by saying that any other donator on the earth like Hariścandra was neither born nor will be born. So, I request you to donate sufficient money for my son’s marriage.’ Hariścandra agreed to award money for the marriage.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Viśwāmitra used his illusive power. A beautiful girl aged ten and a handsome tender youth appeared there. Viśwāmitra said—‘Today itself I have to perform the ceremony of their marriage. One who helps in the marriage, gets the merit of even more than that of a Rājasūya YajÛa’; Hariścandra gave his consent without any consideration to donate wealth. Viśwāmitra, taking Hariścandra with him, reached the hermitage and began to make the mimetic performance of the marriage ceremonial function.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just in front of Hariścandra, Viśwāmitra was performing the wedding ceremony of the bride and bridegroom. The fire was flaming, the wedding Paṇḍāla was well decorated, benedictory verses were being recited and Hariścandra was watching all being spell-bound. In the end of the marriage ceremony, Viśwāmitra said—‘O the king! Whatever you want to donate, donate it to the bride and bridegroom on this holy occasion in this very Paṇḍāla.’ Hariścandra said—‘Lord! What do you want? Kindly express clearly your craving. I will leave no stone unturned in fulfilling your desire. Bringing Hariścandra completely under his spell, Viśwāmitra said—‘O the king! Donate your kingdom including elephants, horses, chariot, jewels and all the possessions. At that moment Hariścandra was so much charmed that without any consideration in the unconscious state the word ‘given’ came out of his mouth and the hard-hearted Viśwāmitra too, at once said—‘Taken’.*</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">* मोहितो मायया तस्य श्रुत्वा वाक्यं मुनेर्नृप:।</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Right-English"><span class="char-style-override-9">—देवी भागवत</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Viśwāmitra then said further—‘O your majesty! In the śāstras, to prove the consummation of charity, an another kind of Dakṣiṇā has been mentioned. Manu, himself has said that without the payment of the Dakṣiṇā the charity goes fruitless only. So, donate any other object worth charitable. Hariścandra said with astonishment—‘Lord! What is the donation worth charitable, it is you, yourself, tell me!’ Viśwāmitra said—‘Twenty-five grams more gold will be its donation.’ The king said—‘I will give.’ ‘He himself was amazed how he was going on saying all this.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the meanwhile, the soldiers of the king, left behind, searching him reached there on the hermitage. They admired the king excessively, but the king uttered nothing at that time. Seeking permission from Viśwāmitra, he set out for his capital with the soldiers.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">It is very easy to say anything, but very difficult to practise it accordingly. This is the difference between the common people and great personage that the common people deviate from their statement while facing the difficulties but the great persons don’t deviate the least from the moral promises even if promised unknowingly or under any compulsion thus, far even in dream. Righteousness is truth and truth is righteousness. The truth against morality is not truth and morality against truth is not morality.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hariścandra had promised of his donation of entire possessions whether it might have been promised even under compulsion. He had no worry for himself. According to his promise, he would have been pleased no doubt; but after coming back to the capital he was much worried to think what he should speak to his chaste wife śaibyā? How should he console his small child, Rohitāśva? Hariścandra was not greedy of wealth, he had no attachment with his kingship; he could sacrifice his body; but he could not see śaibyā and Rohitāśva sad. He thought to send śaibyā to her paternal house and Rohita would also stay there and I will surrender myself at the feet of that ascetic Brāhmaṇa. Well! What is more to be done?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">śaibyā was not a common lady, she was an ideal chaste woman; her soul had union with Hariścandra’s soul, in the other words it may be said that inspite of being the two seperate bodies, the spirit of the couple was a single one. After her husband’s coming back from the forest, when she began to attend and look after him personally, Hariścandra’s mental disposition could not remain hidden. She thought that whenever her lord returned from outside, happiness used to be on his face, his eyes used to be full of love, his eye–brow used to rain grace; what is the matter today? Why is the expression of worry and anxiety on the face of the lord?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">śaibyā asked—‘Lord! Why are you so sad today? Have you failed to donate any gift of charity to any supplicant? Has any such deed been done by you, while doing it you had failed to remember the Almighty God? Have you dishonoured any being by your action, speech or mind? Have you promised any such a thing which is doubtful to be fulfilled? lord! Kindly don’t hide anything from me. I am feeling afflicted to see your anxiety. I fail to understand why you look so worried. You have no pain in your body, my Rohita is all well, I am just before you, then, what is the reason of your worry?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hariścandra said—‘Beloved! By the mercy of God no hindrance has occurred in fulfilling my moral duty. Yesterday, in the forest I have donated entire empire in charity to an ascetic Brāhmaṇa. Now, I am worried that I myself, can pass my days being his servant; but how will I keep you and Rohitāśva as an attendant? It is becoming unendurable to me. At that moment I was feeling spell-charmed, I had no presence of mind at that moment; but anyway, I have already donated in charity and I have to fulfill it gladly. What is the value of wealth; how long will this royalty continue? Beloved! All these are momentary like flashes of lightning. Today it appears tomorrow it disappears, if through it an eternal object like morality and righteousness can be achieved, then what is there any harm to give them up? Now, let us be engaged with fortitude in fulfilling the moral duty.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">śaibyā said—‘Lord! It is a matter of great pleasure. We could not memorise God on account of being entangled with the royal affairs. You had to remain separate from me and I used to remain deprived of your service. God has given us good opportunity. Now, I will be always remain in your association and service of what value is of kingship or wealth? It is a matter of great pleasure that we are able to make best use of it.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of śaibyā, Hariścandra became worriless. He began to admire her in his own mind. He began to think that this is called an ideal wife. My desire is her desire, her pleasure lies in my pleasure, God’s dispensation is always beneficial. Well! What is more required? Throughout my life I may serve her, I may not be separated from her, this much is required. It was late in the night. Both Hariścandra and śaibyā fell asleep.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day, Hariścandra had not yet completed his daily routine, when the gate-keeper informed coming to him—‘Your majesty! A great ascetic Brāhmaṇa has come.’ He says—‘This kingdom is mine. At once, inform the king. What is your command?’ Going there to him Hariścandra welcomed him and seating him on the high seat, worshipped him. Viśwāmitra said—‘O the king! Yesterday, you have donated your entire kingdom to me. You are great truthful and virtuous. Now, fulfil your promise. Give up the kingship and manage twenty-five grams of gold for me.’ Hariścandra said—‘Lord! This kingdom belongs to you certainly, now take over it. I have already given it to you. As regards twenty-five grams of gold, just I am arranging’. Hariścandra pointed towards the treasurer.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the treasurer came with the gold, Viśwāmitra asked—‘Where from has this gold been brought? Has it been brought from the royal treasury? Hariścandra! you are cheating me. When you surrendered the entire kingdom to me, did the treasury belong to you? What does it mean to give the gold to me from my own treasury? Did you deviate from your promise? If you can’t give, don’t give. I gave it up.’ Hearing the words of Viśwāmitra, Hariścandra said with restlessness—‘Lord! Pardon me, pardon me. I committed a great blunder. I realise my guilt. This treasury belongs to you. Treasurer! Take away this gold and keep it in the treasury as it was. Lord! At present, I have no gold, give me sometime, I will give you without fail.’ Viśwāmitra said—‘First of all, this kingdom belongs to me, you donated this earth to me; now, you have no right to stay here. Whatever the ornaments you have on your body, put off them at once and along with your wife and son, wearing the bark garment, go out of this state immediately. I have no consideration of time. Fulfil the promise made by you.’ The king along with his wife and son set out of the royal palace in bark garment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Somewhere, the story reveals that having returned from Indra’s celestial world, Viśwāmitra called the spirit of Hariścandra to himself by his Yogic power. Hariścandra’s body was sleeping in the royal palace and his spirit was standing before Viśwāmitra with folded hands. Viśwāmitra said—‘O the king! You are a great charity giver. Your repute is spreading in all the three worlds. Surrender your entire kingdom to me in charity. If you don’t do so, I will burn your entire kingdom to ashes by the power of my penance. Hariścandra thought that ‘it is better to destroy myself than to see the entire kingdom being destroyed and what is the meaning of destruction in it? By surrendering the entire kingdom to the seer, I will be free from the botheration of royal affairs and I will worship God.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hariścandra said to Viśwāmitra—‘Lord! I offered my entire kingdom at your feet. Now, nothing belongs to me rather everything belongs to you.’ Praising Hariścandra, Viśwāmitra demanded the Brāhmaṇa gift for the accomplishment of his charity. At that moment Hariścandra’s soul returned to the capital and he got awaken. He saw that he was sleeping in the royal palace. It was all merely a dream. All the occurrences of the dream began to appear before his eye-sight—The sage-hermitage, his facial figure and his name Viśwāmitra all began to haunt his mind. He began to think—‘Probably it may be a dream but I have given my entire kingdom in charity. Now, I am no longer a king, I have no right of the kingship, it is sin to use it in my own interest.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day, in the royal assembly before the minister and the counsellors of the assembly, he narrated the whole story. The counsellors said—‘What is the evidence of the dream-happening? There are so many unexpected things what the people see, hear and say in the dream. If everything of the dream is materialised, it will create a chaos in the world. Your majesty! Forget it and continue the rule as usual.’ Hariścandra disapproved the counsellor’s opinion. He said—‘No doubt, I have made the donation in the dream, but it is true that I have donated. Now, I cannot deviate from this. This kingdom, now, belongs to the same sage. The location of his hermitage is not known to me. Hence, so long as his location is not traced out, I will manage the royal affairs; but the attendants should be sent to search him out and since today the royal stamp of his name should be introduced for use. He will be now the lord of the kingdom and I will be his attendant.’ According to the order of Hariścandra the emissaries were sent to search him out and the stamp was changed. The assembly resounded with the shout of well done and blessed one.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All of a sudden Viśwāmitra happened to come to the assembly. Just seeing him, Hariścandra’s face flourished. He said—‘It is, he, it is he to whom I had donated in the dream and who is the sole king of this state, the same sage has arrived himself. What a great mercy of God is! He has made me to keep the promise of my dream.’ Having received Viśwāmitra with warm welcome, he seated him on the throne. Viśwāmitra said—‘Hariścandra! you are well reputed among the truthful persons. But what is that truth that you rushed back without giving the gift after donating your kingdom and today you are still continuing as king?’ Hariścandra satisfied him showing the stamp of his name and by giving words to donate the gift and left the palace with his wife and son. All right!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At that moment, when the king went out of the palace barefooted and bareheaded, in the bark garment with śaibyā and Rohitāśva, loud lamentation engulfed the entire Ayodhyā. By the whispering of ears everyone came to know it and all surrounded him inside the very city. Somebody said—‘We are your followers, don’t leave us. Be kind to take us also with you.’ Someone was saying—‘O the king! Stay a while more. Let me stare at you  once for my satisfaction. God knows, when will we get your vision again?’ Somebody was saying to someone—‘The same HariÜcandra the majesty, on whose coming out a number of kings followed him in a line, with folded hands, a number of attendants having mounted on the elephants and armed with weapons guarded him on the way, is walking on the earth barefooted. How will this tender prince, whose body has not experienced even the touch of rough wind till now, walk bare-footed on the ground? His long hair will be covered with dust, his face will be fainted. Oh! Providence! What a distress have you brought? Someone was saying—‘Oh! Just watch the queen śaibyā, who was invisible to the rays of the sun even, to whom the air reached with the feeling of fear, who never stepped out of the palace, who slept on the soft bed like the foam of milk, the same queen is going on foot in the garment of bark. Will she sleep under the trees? Which action has given this result? Had such a royal devotee couple to suffer such a calamity?’ Seeing this condition of the royal family, some people were weeping, some were wailing and some were fainting. HariÜcandra was moving ahead without any morbid feeling and consoling them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Coming there ViÜwāmitra said—‘HariÜcandra! Are you still staying here? Make haste to go away from here. The earth given in charity should not be used? Well! You did not tell me one thing; When will you give me the balance donation? How long should I wait for you today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow?’ HariÜcandra said—‘Lord! I have nothing at present, otherwise I would have given you at once. I am indebted to you, kindly, give me time of one month. I will pay off your balance donation at any cost.’ ViÜwāmitra said—‘Alright. Go, the day on which the month is over, if you failed to give the donation on very that day, I will burn you to ashes.’ HariÜcandra admitted with folded hands.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When he began to go away from there, the subjects again surrounded him. All of them said—‘O the king! All of us including the our family members will follow you like shadow, having given up the entire wealth and property. We will stay there where you halt; the happiness is there where you are present. That is our city and that is heaven for us.’ Hearing the subjects’ affectionate loving words,  emotional sentiments aroused in HariÜcandra’s heart, realising their agony, he himself became disprited. He began to console them—‘If you follow me, my dilemma will increase more, you will also be distressed. Staying here, do your moral duty and I, too, should fulfil my righteous duty staying somewhere else. This life has been blessed to us only for the sake of righteousness. God’s will is the supreme. Whatever He does, He does good. All of you should chant names of God and worship Him.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">HariÜcandra was hardly consoling them, than, coming there ViÜwāmitra again started rebuking him. His eyes were growing red in anger. He said—‘you have become apostate. You tell a lie. You deceive. In spite of donation, you conspire among the subjects with the motive to take it back. Hearing these harsh words of ViÜwāmitra, ‘Just, I go away at once,’ saying these words HariÜcandra took hold of śaibyā’s hands and dragging her began to go.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing this behaviour of ViÜwāmitra, all the five world gods, who existed in the space at that moment, melted with pity. All of a sudden it came out of their mouths—‘ViÜwāmitra is a great sinner. He will not get place even in the hell. He made HariÜcandra deprived of his kingship, cheated him cunningly. Now, who will provide us drinking of ‘Somarasa’ in the YajÛas, who will offer us his devotion to flourish? These words of the gods reached the ears of ViÜwāmitra. He said— ‘Being gods you favour the living beings so much so may all of you be the mortal beings!’ Later on, the demi-gods pleased ViÜwāmitra by earnest and humble prayers and ViÜwāmitra gave them freedom to attain heaven after having been born from the womb, being free from lust and anger without living a domestic life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">No doubt, HariÜcandra did set out of Ayodhyā; now, the question arose in his mind where to go. The entire earth was donated, now, he should not stay here but where is the place left for him except here? Abruptly, the place of KāÜī came to his mind. He thought—KāÜī is apart from all the three worlds. It is situated on the trident, it is free from birth and death, it is the capital of Lord śiva. The embodiment of compassion, mother Annapūrṇā has the consideration of everyone. Let us move there. HariÜcandra moved for KāÜī slowly and slowly with śaibyā and RohitāÜva.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">It is not difficult to become a virtuous person if  there is empire, property, wealth, friends and attendants, ready to obey the commands. Then, even not being a virtuous, it can be made a mimetic performance of being virtuous and moral and can be called virtuous. But when the pocket is empty, when there is no house to live in, when there are no animals and birds for help, and not even a loaf of bread is available to eat, even then, to remain stable on the righteousness with pleasure, is the job of only great souls. It is only in the days of misery, when the patience and morality are tested.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When HariÜcandra reached KāÜī with his wife śaibyā and son RohitāÜva, only single day was left to complete the month. KāÜī was yet a little away, the big temples were visible from there. The sound of the waves of the Ganges was also heard sometime. He was just about to enter the city, when śaibyā got exhausted, the thorn pierced into the feet of RohitāÜva and he began to take out the thorn from his feet sitting there under a tree. He saw that blisters had grown in the delicate sole of the feet of RohitāÜva, the tears were just to drop from his eyes but however stopped. The thorn was taken out, but he could not proceed further on account of śaibyā’s excessive tiredness. This was the reason that it took about a month to reach KāÜī from Ayodhyā; otherwise he would have reached much earlier. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">RohitāÜva said—‘Father! I am feeling appetite.’ HariÜcandra called—‘Is there anyone here? My child is feeling appetite, bring something.’ Uttering this much his face lowered down with hesitation. RohitāÜva said—‘Mother! I am feeling hungry.’ A few drops of tears fell down from her eyes. HariÜcandra said—‘Beloved! What is there to be sad? When I was enjoying the kingship given by the Lord gladly, why should I not face sufferings also allotted by Him gladly? This is His gift, it should not be disrespected. It should be accepted whole-heartedly.’ RohitāÜva said—‘Father I am feeling hungry.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">HariÜcandra said—‘Son! Just see how beautiful is this Ganges! How happily the crane, swan and other birds are playing here! This is a parrot, This cuckoo is saying ‘kuhu-kuhu’. These peacocks are dancing spreading their feathers. Just watch, how pleasant it is!’ RohitāÜva said ‘Is it Gaṅgā?’ HariÜcandra responded, ‘Yes son! It is Gaṅgā.’ RohitāÜva said—‘Is it a swan?’ HariÜcandra—‘<span class="char-style-override-10">y</span>es, my son! It is a very charming swan.’ RohitāÜva—‘Father! I am feeling hungry.’ HariÜcandra said—‘Son! Have a patience. You are a king. Can you not bear appetite? Well! Let us walk to the court of mother Annapūrṇā, certainly, something or the other will be managed.’ RohitāÜva said—‘Father! I can not bear it any more. Even yesterday too you had given me nothing. Mother! I will eat ‘laddu’. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While this conversation was going on, in the mean-while an old woman happened to come. HariÜcandra said to her—‘Goddess! We belong to another country. The way to the city is not known. How to enter the city?’ The old woman said—‘O the fortunate! There is the mark of an Emperor in your body. How did you come to this condition?’ HariÜcandra said—‘Mother! What is gain to narrate the past story? What will you do to know it?’ RohitāÜva said—‘Father! I am feeling hungry.’ The old woman began to give some viands of breakfast, having taken out of her small packet. HariÜcandra said—‘Mother! We don’t want to take obligation from anybody. Don’t give anything in alms to this child.’ The old woman said—‘What! Does this child belong to you only, is he not mine? I will feed him.’ While giving the viand of the breakfast, that old woman guided him the way to the city and went away from there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">HariÜcandra said to śaibyā—‘Beloved! Today the month is going to be over. What should be done? How should the truth be kept? Will I deviate from the truth while I am alive?’ Still HariÜcandra’s sentence had hardly been completed than ViÜwāmitra reached there abruptly. The king saluted him humbly and said—‘Lord! This is my life, this is my son, and this is my wife. Kindly, order us what service should we render to you?’ ViÜwāmitra said—‘I know nothing about all these things. Today the month is going to be over. Give me my balance donation? Are you determined to fulfil your promise? Just see, it is going to be the mid of the day.’ HariÜcandra said—‘Lord! Wait for the later part of the day. Before sunset I will pay off the promised gift.’ ViÜwāmitra said—‘Alright! I will come again in the evening. If you fail to give me the balance gift, it will result in a disaster.’ ViÜwāmitra went away.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">HariÜcandra began to think—‘How to manage for his balance gift, in this condition who can give me loan even? No donation can be accepted from anyone. If I died without giving the gift, who would be more wretched than me? There is only one way that I should sell myself. I should  become someone’s servant for the whole life. By paying off the gift anyhow, I must fulfil my promise.’ With this mental conflict HariÜcandra became restless. He was feeling helpless. śaibyā said—‘Your majesty! Remaining free from worry, follow the path of truth. The untrue persons are to be shunned like cremation ground.’ Truth is the supreme religion. Fire sacrifice, study, charity all prove fruitless for untrue person. I have heard through the Purāṇas, a king, named Kr̥ti had performed seven ‘AÜwamedha yajÛa’, he had performed ‘Rājasūya YajÛa’ even; but he fell down from the heaven due to his false statement. Your majesty! If you don’t mind let me make a prayer—‘Now, I have already given birth to an issue.’ Just saying this śaibyā began to weep. HariÜcandra said—‘O the auspicious! Don’t weep. Your son is with you. Whatever you want to say, speak frankly.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">śaibyā said—‘O the king! I have already given birth of an issue. So, my wedding has its consummation. Now, sell me to somebody’. I will render to him my services and you give away my price to ViÜwāmitra.’ Hearing śaibyā’s words HariÜcandra became like fainted. Anyhow controlling himself he began to say—‘Beloved! What did you say this? It is a matter of a great pain. Is the bond of our love gone? Did we forget the happy days? How can I be able to do such an act of cruelty? Curse to me that I heard these pinching words! curse to me!’ HariÜcandra fell down on the ground.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">śaibyā began to persuade him—‘O the king! Which deed has resulted in such a fruit? Why are you lying down on the ground in such a way? I cannot dare to see you who have already enjoyed the pleasures of Indra and Upendra, lying on the earth in such a way.’ Hardly saying this much, śaibyā’s throat choked and being unconscious she also fell down on the ground. While weeping RohitāÜva began to call—‘Father! Get up. Mother! Get up, take me into your laps. I am feeling hungry, feed me something. Why are both of you weeping? Why do not you listen to me, my tongue is parching make me drink water.’ In the meanwhile ViÜwāmitra presented himself there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">ViÜwāmitra woke up the fainted HariÜcandra and śaibyā spraying cool water of his vessel with spout on them and said—‘O the king! Come into sense and fulfil your promise. A debtor’s sufferings increase every moment.’ HariÜcandra again fainted to see ViÜwāmitra. He did not faint so because he might be escaped from paying the debt, but he fainted in getting no solution to pay the debt. Making him conscious again, ViÜwāmitra said—‘O the king! Truth is highly glorious. By the power of truth the sun rises, and it is the power of truth that this earth exists. It is the truth which is the supreme righteousness and only by the power of truth there is the existence of the heaven. Thousands of AÜwamedha YajÛa cannot equal truth. You, get up, observe righteousness. Don’t delay.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">ViÜwāmitra further said—‘It is futile for me to expect truthfulness from such a wicked fellow. If the gift of charity is not donated to me by the evening, it will result in a great disaster.’ ViÜwāmitra went away. The king became more worried. śaibyā insisted again—‘Fulfil your promise by selling me.’ After her insisting again and again HariÜcandra said—‘I will do this cruel deed also. Beloved! You are really a goddess, it is you only, due to whom my truthfulness is going to be kept. I will sell you, I will sell RohitāÜva and very gladly I will sell myself in the hands of pariah. But I will not deviate from truthfulness. It is truth that is my life, it is truth that is my soul.’ HariÜcandra entered the city with his wife and son. He began to shout loudly—‘O the inhabitants of the city! Listen to me. What do you ask? Who am I, I am a cruel, I am deprived of humanity. I am worse than even a devil. I myself, have brought my own wife to sell her loving than even my life. If anyone of you need a maid-servant, purchase her.’ Hearing the words of HariÜcandra, most of the people were getting amazed; some of them were feeling pity; many of them were thinking—What a calamity has fallen upon him that he is selling his wife. Many a kind-hearted persons began to drop tears from their eyes.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the same moment an old Brāhmaṇa approaching him said—‘I want to purchase her. I am in need of a maid-servant. My devoted wife is very delicate. She is incapable of doing the domestic chores. Tell me, what price will you charge?’ HariÜcandra said—‘Lord! I don’t know what her price should be. Whatever you consider proper, kindly pay it to me.’ ViÜwāmitra disguised in the form of Brāhmaṇa, said—‘O the king! Your wife is worthy from all the point of views. Her appearance indicates her chastity. She will protect her chastity throughout her life. Her position, her doings, her age, her appearance all these qualities in her, are the qualities of a high ranked woman. So, she deserves her price worth of one crores of golden coins.’ Having uttered this, he put the golden coins in his bark garment and holding śaibyā he began to take her away with him. RohitāÜva caught hold of her ‘Sari’. Rebuking him, that old Brāhmaṇa was just dragging śaibyā, when the limit of her patience broke down. She began to weep.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">She said—‘O the Brāhmaṇa god! You purchased me. I became your maid-servant. I am ready to go with you. But leave me for a moment so that I may stare my child to my satisfaction. Again when will be he available?’ Casting her glance towards RohitāÜva, she said—‘My son! Don’t touch me. Prince! Now, I have became a maid-servant.’ The child RohitāÜva, seeing his mother in this condition, calling her ‘Ambā-Ambā’ (mother) began to weep and caught hold of her tightly. At any cost he was not leaving his mother. Rebuking him the Brāhmaṇa kicked him, he fell down. śaibyā could not lift her. She said beseeching—‘Now you are my master. I request you only to purchase this child also. If you don’t purchase him, I will not be able to serve you with the best of my capacity even after going to your residence. My mind will remain engrossed with RohitāÜva. How will I do the work?’ The Brāhmaṇa said—‘It cannot be so. If I purchase him, you will remain engaged day and night in fondling him, how will then domestic work be done? I will not purchase him.’ But the child was not ready to leave his mother at any cost.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Showing pity, the Brāhmaṇa accepted it and having paid his price, took the both, the mother and son away. Having mentally saluted HariÜcandra, śaibyā made prayer to the Lord—‘Lord! If my husband has kept his truth with the true heart and If I am truly his devotee with my mind, action and speech, soon I should be blessed to meet him.’ HariÜcandra turned back his face. It was unbearable for him to see śaibyā’s such condition. But he had love for truth greater than love for śaibyā in his heart. Immediately after the departure of the Brāhmaṇa, śaibyā and RohitāÜva, ViÜwāmitra presented himself there. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At that moment HariÜcandra was contemplating what the frolicsome play of the Lord is! The wind, sun, moon and others could not get even a glimpse of śaibyā, now the same śaibyā had become the purchased maid-servant of any other one. Rohita, about whom it was the presumption that he would be the Emperor one day, the same Rohita was starving now, and was being kicked by some one. But what is to be done, it is here my good lies, it is here, benediction lies for all. He was just  thinking, when ViÜwāmitra reminded him of his balance gift. HariÜcandra put before him all that he possessed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">ViÜwāmitra asked—‘O the king! How did you get this wealth? As regards the donation in charity, that you cannot accept as you are a Kṣatriya, you can never demand of anyone, then, where from did you get so much wealth?’ HariÜcandra said—‘O Lord! What will you do to know it? Let me forget those things. By recollecting it, my heart  becomes restless.’ ViÜwāmitra said—‘Without knowing it I cannot accept this at all. Only the wealth earned justifiably, can be used for gift. I will not accept the wealth earned by immoral means at all.’ HariÜcandra narrated his entire story. ViÜwāmitra said—‘O the king! This wealth is too scanty. Only this sum of amount does not fulfil my balance gift. Make haste to give me more donation.’ HariÜcandra said—‘Lord! Till now, I have sold my wife and my son only. Kindly, wait for sometime more. I will fulfil your donation. O the great of ascetics! Don’t be angry. I will give you whatever I get. I can stoop to serve even to the pariah, but I cannot deviate from truth.’*</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">* मुनीन्द्र मा कुपस्तुभ्यं लभ्यं यच्छामि कांचनम्।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">विधाय निर्विषादस्य निषादस्यापि दासताम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">ViÜwāmitra said—‘Now, very little time is left. It will have to be managed before the sun-set. If I did not get my donation in time, I will drift you from truth.’ Warning in this way, ViÜwāmitra moved away to some other direction. With patience, HariÜcandra began to say—‘Brother, before sun-set somebody should purchase me. I will serve him by all means.’ Just he was moving ahead declaring in such a way, ‘Dharma’ disguised in the form of a wretched appeared before him. He said to HariÜcandra—‘I am in the need of a servant, I will purchase you. Tell me your price.’ Seeing his dreadful appearance, HariÜcandra got suspicious. He said—‘Brother! Who are you?’ The mean fellow said—‘I am an outcast person named Pravīra. My profession is to take the shroud of the dead bodies and execution.’ HariÜcandra trembled by heart. He could not decide immediately whether it was proper to be sold in the hands of a wretched or not. On one side if he failed to be sold  before sun-set and could not pay the debt of donation, there was fear, deviating from truthfulness and on the other side if he sold himself, he would have to serve an outcast person. Against his consciousness and the moral rule, what  would be his end by serving the wretched?’ He was, thus, engrossed in thinking.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just at the moment, ViÜwāmitra with his red eyes in anger was seen coming. Just seeing ViÜwāmitra, HariÜcandra fell down on his feet. ViÜwāmitra said— ‘When this wretched is ready to pay your sufficient price, why are you hesitating in getting yourself sold? Don’t you want to give me my gift?’ With folded hands HariÜcandra said—‘Lord! I belong to the holy Solar-dynasty. Till now, I have done no work against rules of morality of orders of society and stage of life. My conscience does not allow me easily to serve a wretched. But if you are pleased with this even, and it is your command accordingly, then, there is no hitch to be sold, I can go to the extent to sacrifice myself on the feet of the wretched.’ ViÜwāmitra nodded and that wretched purchased HariÜcandra giving crores of guineas of gold in return. ViÜwāmitra took his donation and that outcaste took away HariÜcandra with him to the cremation ground.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">It is said that the diamond glitters as much as it is turned on a lathe. Sweet are the uses of adversity. Adversity is the mother of prosperity. A smooth sailor is known in the stormy sea. It is the test that decides the value. When can a person, who has never suffered from the calamities of life, test his self-potency? When the Lord finds that someone is steady on the righteousness even in the thorny days of his life, He lifts him in his lap, being pleased. The test has also its limits and the success is there on its limits. The end of HariÜcandra’s test is just close to him, let us proceed towards the fruit of his success watching his devotion to truth with fortitude.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">HariÜcandra was kept in a closed cell having fastened his hands and legs for four days. He had no memory of his appetite and thirst and he had never thought even that he would have to take meal at a wretched’s house. On the fifth day, he was set free from the captivity and he was brought at the cremation ground. Having rebuked and admonished him, the wretched gave him instruction—‘Stay here at the cremation ground and take the shroud of the dead body whosoever comes here for funeral. HariÜcandra began to discharge his duty very carefully day and night. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Different types of persons used to come to the cremation ground to burn their dead relatives. HariÜcandra charged the tax of the cremation ground and saw daily the people wailing, crying burning the dying ones. He got dispassionate from this worldly life. Staying at the funeral ground he saw and well experienced that the end of the life and the end of the body is as such. One day or the next, everyone has to come here on this spot of the river bank. Then, it is good that I came here in advance. It is useless to deviate from the truth for the sake of that body which is to be perished in this way and for the pleasure and comfort of that body there is need of empire, woman, son and wealth. God protected me, He saved me from the worldly attachment. This thought brought peace to his mind. He began to discharge his duty gladly remembering God and according to the God’s will for his presence there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, it so happened that at about midnight some persons brought a woman there forcibly and that wretched was also with them. The people said to HariÜcandra— ‘At once, you kill this woman.’ HariÜcandra said—‘I cannot use arms on a woman. It is true that I am sold, but I am doing my duty. My work is not to kill a woman.’ The wretched said—‘Your work is nothing but to do what I order. That is your work. You have been sold to the hands of an outcaste mean person and you talk of the gods. You don’t know about the servant’s duty. He forcibly gave the dagger to HariÜcandra’s hands and all of them went away.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That woman said to HariÜcandra—‘Brother! I am visited by a great calamity. I had a small child who had gone to the forest to take the sacred grass for that person where I live and there he died with the bite of a snake. In the daytime I did not get permission to go there, at this dead of the night when I went to him and began to weep, these people caught me and began to say—‘You are a witch and you have come here to eat up this dead body.’ I wept bitterly, implored earnestly and humbly, but they did not listen to me at all. They forcibly brought me here and ordered you to kill me. I pray to you to leave me for a moment, so that I may bring the dead body of my son and I make his funeral rite, then you may kill me. I have no attachment to my life.’ HariÜcandra allowed her and she went away to bring the dead body of her son. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">HariÜcandra was watching here and there on the cremation ground. There was a great mental conflict going on in his mind about that woman. Suddenly a pathetic sound came to his ear. He became alert. It was the pathetic voice of a woman. He listened to it attentively. She was saying—‘O my loved one! Such is your condition! Is there none to protect us? O Fortune! You are very cruel. O Vidyādharī! You are an ogress. Why are you killing my husband?’ HariÜcandra heard all this. He came to conclude that she was the wife of any king. Somebody is sacrificing her husband. Going onward he asked—‘O the auspicious one! Why are you weeping?’ The woman said—‘O the fortunate one! Why are you asking me? Just see moving a little onward.’ Going there HariÜcandra saw that a man was getting hung to a banyan tree in upward down position. His long hair were hanging, his body was smeared with red-sandal, near him the fire was blazing in three basins. On the query that man said—‘I am the son of the king of KāÜī. She is my wife. Both of us were sleeping at the same place. Some ogress kidnapped us coming from the above. I am not the least worried of my being kidnapped. I am thinking that no doubt she will sacrifice me, but she brought her for no use and what will you do to hear, make haste, run away from here. That female devil would be just coming after taking bath in the Ganges.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">HariÜcandra thought to himself that to protect him was more important than the keeping of truth. Whatever I have done till now, I have done by this external body. My truth and forbearance all relate to external body. If I sacrifice my life, I could save his life, what a good it would be!<span class="char-style-override-11">1 </span>To release that prince he became so rash that he forgot of his being a servant. He said to the prince—‘Your majesty! I make a humble request to you, kindly, accept it. Prince! There are two kinds of persons rare in this world. First it is they who never reject anyone’s prayer and the second one are those who never pray to anyone.<span class="char-style-override-11">2</span> I hope you will certainly accept my prayer.’</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Taking a long breath the prince said—‘Sire! I have nothing at present. How can I fulfil your prayer?’ HariÜcandra said—‘I utter the same what you can do.’ After the prince’s acceptance, HariÜcandra said—‘I just break your bonds and I get myself tied in your place.’ First, the prince disagreed but on the insistence of HariÜcandra and that woman, he agreed. HariÜcandra untied his tie and got himself tied in his place. The prince went away from there with his wife thinking that the condition of mind is strange, on the one side first he was sacrificing his own life for the protection of the other one’s life and on the other side along with this the other one does not give any value to his life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyādharī came. She was highly pleased to see HariÜcandra in place of the prince. She said—‘First I had brought a would-be king. His body has the symptoms of an Emperor.’ She started her fire-sacrifice—HariÜcandra began to offer her the piece of his body-flesh cutting it with his own hands. Now, he was hardly going to cut his neck to offer his head, when an ascetic appeared there. Vidyādharī ran away from there just seeing him. First, he rebuked HariÜcandra badly; but further showing pity to him he applied such a medicine in his body that his wounded body became as it was earlier. On the other side the wretched called him—‘Where did you go away leaving the cremation ground? Seeking permission from the ascetic, HariÜcandra reached the river bank and the ascetic went away.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reaching the funeral ground, HariÜcandra felt asleep. He began to see the dream. He found himself born in the species of the outcast, remained suffering for hundreds of years the tortures of the Hell, remained wandering about in the eighty-four lakhs of the species of births of animals, birds, insects etc., in one of the births he became the king but he lost his entire possessions in the gambling, he saw śaibyā weeping and wailing, saw RohitāÜva suffering from misery and at last he saw that some attendants of the Yama were taking him away to the land of Yama. There he got the vision of Lord Yama. He said—‘You got perturbed only by this much sufferings? This is the only a little portion of whatever you have experienced wandering and undergoing the sufferings of the worlds from eternity. Go, now you go. Later on your son will also die and you will still suffer more, but very soon you will get the happiness also.’ Just while HariÜcandra was dreaming all this, that woman, wailing and having taken the dead body of her son in her lap came to reach there and the distressful loud cry of the woman made him get up from the dream. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being awaken he reached that woman and said—‘First, give me the shroud, then perform the funeral rite of your son.’ śaibyā could give the shroud but wherefrom? Really, what did she have? She was weeping clinging her son to her chest. HariÜcandra saw that the child was very handsome. His body had the symptoms of an Emperor. He had died of snake-bite. My RohitāÜva would also be of the same age. May God protect him! He could not recognise śaibyā. Her appearance had changed on account of excessive work as a maid-servant. śaibyā also did not recognise HariÜcandra. She had not even dreamt of that her lord would be in the form of a wretched. She began to wail.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Son! Where are you? Why don’t you respond? What is the sin that is causing us such a suffering? Where is my lord? He does not even console me. He does not come even to awake you. On the confidence of whose support, has he become so unconcerned? The empire slipped from hand willingly, it matters little. It also does not matter that he sold his wife and son because it kept his promise of truth at least. But the <span class="char-style-override-10">e</span>mperor’s son, the son of <span class="char-style-override-10">e</span>mperor HariÜcandra has been brought to the cremation ground for the funeral rite and there is not even shroud on his body, does he know it?’ śaibyā was lamenting and her cry was reaching HariÜcandra’s ears. Now, he came to recognise śaibyā. ‘Oh! This is śaibyā? My Rohita died.’ Saying this HariÜcandra fell down on the ground. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Within a few moment HariÜcandra became conscious and he began to cry in distress—‘Son! <span class="char-style-override-10">p</span>rince! Why does my heart not break down to see you in the form of a corpse? You rushed to my lap saying—‘Father; you clung to my heart, now where did you go away? You used to make my garments dirty with your body covered with dust, how delighted I felt! Son! I am a mean. I sold you like a straw, but you should not be so cruel. Come, and speak to me. Laugh with me.’ HariÜcandra snatched the dead body of RohitāÜva to his lap and became like fainted. śaibyā had already recognised him till now. How much she was pained, cannot be described in words. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Recovering himself on the query of śaibyā, HariÜcandra narrated his entire story and said—‘I am subservient. I am the servant of the wretched, my work is to take the shroud. Now, I don’t see the utility of my life. I would have died burning myself with RohitāÜva on the funeral pyre, but without seeking the permission of the wretched. If I enter the flaming fire, then, in the next birth also I have to be born in the same, the species of wretched-persons. So, due to the sin of committing suicide, I will have to go into the fierce and dreadful hell. So, it suits me to live happily according to the God’s will.’ śaibyā said—‘My lord! What is the use of my life? you are not with me, it was RohitāÜva who also passed away, now for whom should I remain alive? But is’nt it that I am the maid-servant of a Brāhmaṇa. Without his permission, I, too, have no right to die. It is quite good that you are present at the time of your son’s funeral rite.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, it was a hard duty before HariÜcandra, It was the rule that HariÜcandra must take the shroud of the dead whosoever was burnt on that cremation ground. Today, if HariÜcandra deviates from this duty on account of his son’s death and wife’s lamentation, his righteousness would be lacking. He might have been afflicted by his son’s shock to any extent, but he is not a father today rather than a servant of the wretched. He did not deviate the least. He said—‘śaibyā! First give the shroud and then, perform the funeral rite.’ śaibyā said—‘Lord! You just do see! What is there with me? From where should I give you shroud?’ But HariÜcandra turned a deaf ear. śaibyā said—‘I have only this Sari to cover my body. I just give you tearing half portion of this and with the rest half I will save my honour.’ HariÜcandra accepted it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, It was the extremity of the test. The dutifulness of HariÜcandra was fulfilled. He got absorbed in the contemplation of Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, dressed in Pītāmbara. śaibyā, just applied her hand to tear her ‘Sari’. At the same moment the sky was brightened  with light, a very serious sound was heard from the space—‘Your majesty HariÜcandra! You are blessed one, your charity is praise-worthy, your fortitude is admirable, your gallantry is laudable you are an ideal for the generous, enduring and brave persons.’* Flowers began to rain. Lord Nārāyaṇa, Brahmā, Indra, Dharma, Lokapālas, Siddhas, demigods, Rudra all appeared before HariÜcandra. HariÜcandra bowed before them all being amazed and began to stare God with unwinking eyes. Dharma said—‘Enough–enough! You have crossed the limit of dutifulness. I am pleased with your endurance, with your truthfulness and with your devotion to morality and righteousness. Just see, Nārāyaṇa, śaṅkara, Brahmā and Indra have visited to give you their vision. ViÜwāmitra, himself, who has given you such a hard test, wants you to forgive him by befriending you.’ HariÜcandra again paid obeisance to all.</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold">उदारधीरवीराणां हरिश्चन्द्रो निदर्शनम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">ViÜwāmitra said—‘O the king! I have caused you great sufferings. You had expressed your annoyance seeing that female ascetic, she was merely an illusive lady. It was I, who showed you the frolicsome activity of marriage ceremony by creating the illusionary boy and girl, disguised myself in the form of a Brāhmaṇa and took your entire property in charity. It was I, the disguised form of the old Brāhmaṇa, who purchased your wife and son. It was I, disguised in the form of a snake, who bit your son. Whatever the frolicsome activity you saw today in the dream in the night, was all the illusion created by me. I am highly pleased to see your steadfastness to the righteousness. It is you to be given the first place among all the truthful persons while counting being made. Your repute will be immortal and would never be decrepit. You will be beloved to the Supreme Lord. Truth itself is God. To hold it, is to hold God.’ Indra said—‘HariÜcandra! I am Indra. Being pleased with your devotion to truthfulness, the Supreme Lord, Himself, has appeared before you. You have attained perpetual worlds. Accompany me with your wife and son. Now enjoy the fruit of your virtuous deeds.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By the inspiration of God, Indra rained nectar. The sound of drum beating resounded all around. The entire cremation ground of KedāreÜwara got crowded with divine persons. Being alive, RohitāÜva clung to his mother’s chest being overjoyed. His entire body became gentle and healthy as it was before. HariÜcandra embraced him taking him into his lap. The very moment, HariÜcandra’s body turned to be celestial. His body was decorated with charming garments, matchless ornaments and evergreen garlands of flowers, he became healthy, he was quite blissful. śaibyā, too, being decorated with charming garments and ornaments stood beside HariÜcandra along with RohitāÜva. God was watching everything silently, and what to be silent rather than he was honouring HariÜcandra through entering the body of all the gods.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Indra said to HariÜcandra—‘You have attained salvation along with your wife and son. Now, get on the divine chariot with me.’ HariÜcandra said—‘O the lord of gods! My master is the wretched one. Without his permission, I cannot move for the heaven.’ Hearing HariÜcandra’s these words, Dharma said humbly—‘HariÜcandra! It was already known to me that you would have to suffer a lot while going through ViÜwāmitra’s test. So, it was I who disguised myself as a wretched one and behaved impudently with you. That wretched is no one else but it was I. There is no need now for seeking permission.’ Indra again emphasized HariÜcandra to move for the heaven.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having offered obeisance to Indra, HariÜcandra said—‘O the Lord of gods! You are pleased with me. So, very humbly I make a prayer to you—‘It is not unknown to you of how much sorrowful the public of Ayodhyā is because of my separation! How can I go to heaven leaving them here? Those, who are my lovers, who depend on me, who are my attendants, I don’t want heaven leaving them here. If all of them accompany me to the heaven, I, too, can accompany them to the heaven. If they go to the hell, I will also like to go to the hell with them.’ Lord Indra said—‘Everyone has one’s own different deeds. The fruit of the evil doing or the virtuous deed differs from individual to individual and your virtuous doings have quite the different fruit. How can all enjoy the same fruit all together?’ HariÜcandra said—‘Your majesty! A king does not administer the reign exclusively by his own power and capacity. Whatever YajÛa he performs, he gets help from his relatives. Whatever has been done by me, is done with the main assistance of the inhabitants of Ayodhyā. I cannot give up them in the greed of heaven.’* So, I, hereby,  pray to you that whatever donation, muttering etc., auspicious deeds have been performed by me, should be equally shared by all and sundry. If I had enjoyed the fruit of my doings all alone, I would have enjoyed it for a long time, but by your kindness, if I share to enjoy with them those fruits even for a single day, I will feel highly blissful.’ </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">It was all God’s frolicsome play. How the aspiration of the devotee can remain unfulfilled? Indra said—‘It will be so’. God disappeared. Indra and ViÜwāmitra marshalled a line of divine chariots from the earth to the Indra’s divine world. They enthroned RohitāÜva on the throne of HariÜcandra, going to Ayodhyā, and took away all the people of Ayodhyā alongwith the king having turned them healthy and strong with their wives, sons and attendants to the paradise. The subjects hearts were puffed with joy to see shifting from one divine chariot to another on the way and immense property of the Paradise. They got indebted and overloaded by the obligation of HariÜcandra. HariÜcandra was absorbed in the meditation of God even in the happy  days just as he used to remember the Lord in his miserable and unfortunate days.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At that time the demon’s cārya, śukrācārya was singing in praise that a king like HariÜcandra was neither born nor would be born. Any agonised person who hears his fable, will be very happy, the aspirant of heaven will get heaven, the desirous of wife will get wife, the craver of son will get son and the craving for the empire will get the empire. Efficacy of patience and tolerance is beyond the description. The great valuable fruit of charity cannot be sketched in words, which provided HariÜcandra Amarāvatī, he became Indra.’*</p>
