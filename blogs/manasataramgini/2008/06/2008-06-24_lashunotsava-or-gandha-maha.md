Hindu tradition mentions the following tale regarding the discovery and
the use of garlic. The brAhmaNa sushruta’s curiosity was aroused by a
foul-smelling bulb and he made enquiries regarding it to the renowned
medical expert divodAsa, the king of kAshI. divodAsa told him that it
was lashuna and described its medicinal properties and therapeutic and
dietary uses to him. The resulting discourse became the prototype of the
lashuna-kalpa of the magico-medical tradition of the Hindus. Since the
smR^itis have proscribed the use of lashuna by the dvija a predicament
arises here. Two apparent solutions are suggested by tradition. One of
these is to make the garlic “pass through the cow”. The other is its
consumption in a special periodic festival known as the lashunotsava or
the gandha-maha. This festival is recorded in the lashuna-kalpa
preserved in both the kAshyapa tantra and the Bower manuscripts. On the
day of the lashunotsava even dvija-s could eat garlic untainted by the
pAtaka. The festival is laid out by rudra in a discourse to bhadrakAlI.
When rudra was roaming in the devadAru forest the wives of the vipra-s
were afflicted with infertility. They called on him to relieve them of
the condition. It was then that he instituted the garlic festival to
cure the wives.
