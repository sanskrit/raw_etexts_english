## NIRVANASHATKAM

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 2, pp. 149-50 (Arena, October 1899, p. 499).)

*\[Swami Vivekananda's partial translation of the "Nirvânashatkam" by
Shankara, recited at Greenacre, Maine, and reported in an 1894 issue of
the* Greenacre Voice*\]*

(*Vide* the notes from discourses delivered at Greenacre, Maine,
entitled "The Religion of India", in this volume of the *Complete Works*
([pp.
267-71](../../notes_of_lectures_and_classes/the_religion_of_india.htm)
.)

Under the Swami's famous pine at Greenacre, Vivekananda said:

"I am neither body nor changes of the body; nor am I senses nor objects
of the senses. I am Existence Absolute. Bliss Absolute. Knowledge
Absolute. I am It. I am It.  
  

"I am neither death nor fear of death; nor was I ever born, nor had I
parents. I am Existence Absolute. Bliss Absolute. Knowledge Absolute. I
am It. I am It.  

"I am not misery nor have I misery. I am not enemy nor have I enemies. I
am Existence Absolute. Bliss Absolute. Knowledge Absolute. I am It. I am
It.

"I am without form, without limit, beyond space, beyond time; I am in
everything, I am the basis of the universe — everywhere am I. I am
Existence Absolute. Bliss Absolute. Knowledge Absolute. I am It. I am
It."
