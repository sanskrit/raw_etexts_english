Tennyson had put it: “Nature, red in tooth and claw” and indeed
biological conflict is our biggest teacher. It has lessons so profound
that some of the foundations of biology itself emerge from its
understanding. And we being a microcosmic part thereof learn much about
how to conduct ourselves in our conflicts from the upAya-s of other life
around us. It is perhaps this understanding that made viShNusharman and
his wise predecessors situate their lessons on human interaction in the
natural world that was there for all to see in old India. It is for this
reason after invoking the pantheon as above he says:

ishvarANAm idaM tantraM prAyeNautsukyam Avahet |  
yatas tirashchAM charitair nItimArgaH pradarshyate ||

This text of the gods might appear puzzling due to its teachings;
however, it intends illustrating by actions of animals the path of right
conduct/politics. In the midst of the wide wisdom he offers he also
gives a brief lesson biological warfare. This comes in the tale of the
bull and the lion where the jackals attendants strive to create a
conflict between the two. In justifying the case for the lion to abjure
his friendship with the bull the jackal damanka warns him of the danger
of biological warfare waged by the bull:

siMha Aha: “sa tAvach ChaShpabhug vayaM pishitabhujas tat kim asau
mamaapakartuM samarthaH ?”  
The lion said: After all this guy is a plant-eater; whereas we are a
flesh-eater; so how is he capable to do me harm?

damanaka Aha: “evam etat | sa shaShpabhug devapAdAH pishitabhujaH | so
.anna-bhUto devapAdA bhoktR^i-bhUtAH | tathA .apy asau yadi svayam
anarthaM na kariShyati tato .anyasmAd utpAdayiShyati |”  
damanaka said: It is indeed so that he is a plant-eater and your
Highness is a flesh-eater; he is food and your Highness is the
food-eater. Even if he cannot himself cause harm, however, he will get
some else to do it for him.

siMha Aha: “kA shaktir asya svato .apakartuM parato .apakartuM vA?”  
The lion said: What power does he have to cause me harm by himself or by
others?

so .abravIt (damanakaH): “tvam tAvad ajasram aneka matta-gaja gavaya
mahiSha varAha shArdUla chitraka yuddheShu
nakha-danta-saMnipAta-kR^ita-vraNa-shabala-tanuH | ayaM punaH sadA tvat
samIpa-vAsI prakIrNa viN-mUtraH | tad anuSha\~NgAch cha kR^imayaH
saMbhaviShyanti | te yuShmach-CharIra-sAmIpyAt kShata vivaraanusAriNo
.antaH pravekShyanti | tathA tvaM vinaShTa eva |”  
He said (damanaka): you are incessantly in combat with elephants in
musth, Gayals, buffaloes, boars, tigers and cheetahs, during which your
body is dotted with wounds caused by the strikes of their claws and
fangs. Now again (saMjIvaka the bull) always stays beside you
splattering feces and urine. And by consequence of that parasites will
begin breeding. As your body is close by, they will invade it making
their way in via the perforations from the wounds. By this means he (the
bull) will cause your destruction.

Thus, viShNusharman’s account is perhaps one of the earliest textual
references of excreta  having a major role in parasite-transmission as
part of predator-herbivore interactions. Of course modern studies
suggest that parasites transmitted by carnivorans (example the
apicomplexan *Sarcocystis*) can infect herbivores and weaken their
muscles/other organs, thereby making them easier prey and furthering
parasite transmission. It is not clear if herbivoran parasites can have
a reciprocal fitness effect on carnivorans. The practice of excreting in
latrines (an ancient trait in the mammalian line first recorded in
dicynodonts of the Triassic) suggests that mammals try to limit
parasite-transmission by localizing excreta. Such latrines of herbivores
could in principle allow transmission of certain debilitating parasites
to carnivorans. Potential parasites transmitted via ungulate excretion
to felids include the apicomplexan *Cryptosporidium* and the worm
nematode *Trichuris*. Such transmission could be exacerbated by a
behavior of carnivorans, namely rolling in ungulate dung and licking
themselves. Another possibility is the nematode worm *Spirocerca*. This
worm is transmitted by dung beetles to felids – such dung beetles could
indeed breed in larger numbers in the presence of bovid dung and could
be available for transmission of the parasite to felids.
