****What were the origins of the pa\~nchatantra (PT) of the great
brAhmaNa viShNusharman?  
It is said that he composed to these tales to teach nIti to the errant
sons of the king amarashakti of the southern janapada of mahilAropya
\[meaning city of ascendant women\]. In his opening verse he salutes the
great teachers of politics and declares the pa\~nchtantra to be an
epitome of the arthashAstra:  
**manave vAchaspataye shukrAya parAsharAya sa-sutAya |  
cANakyAya ca viduShe namo .astu naya-shAstra-kartR^ibhyaH ||**

sakalArtha-shAstra-sAraM jagati samAlokya viShNuSharmedam |  
tantraiH pa\~ncabhir etac cakAra sumanoharaM shAstraM ||  
To manu, to bR^ihaspati, shukra, parAshara and his son and chANakya the
learned, we salute; these great makers of shAstras. Having examined the
essence of all shAstras, viShNusharman too, has composed these five
volumes, a delightful text.

Thus, the great viShNusharman considers himself to belong to the line of
notable scholars of nIti and artha that include vyAsa and parAshara.
Here we shall try to have an overview of the history of this notable
text and trace the origins of its devices back to the mahAbhArata (Mbh).

The age of viShNusharman may be bracketed by two major signposts. An
Iranian version of the PT in Pahlavan from the Sassanian period is
rather confidently dated as being from around 550 CE. This provides the
upper limit. The PT in addition to the salutation of chANakya also
quotes directly from his arthasAstra. Further, in the list of
predecessor chANakya is mentioned as the last authority prior to
viShNusharman. Given that the core arthashAstra is a mauryan text of
around 300 BC, get the lower bound for the PT. On the tentative ground
of the janapadas and pATaliputra being mentioned along with petty rulers
we may place the text closer to declining the mauryan period when there
was brief revival of the janapadas. The PT is also known by other names
such as tantrAkhyAyika (the Kashmirian variant), the pa\~nchAkhyAnaka or
the tantropAkhyAna, and as suggested by some works the most likely
original name was nIti pa\~ncha tantrAkhyAyika.

A phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that there are two major
divisions of the PT texts: 1) the tantrAkhyAyika branch is associated
with Nothern India, principally represented by the Kashmirian recension.
From it were derived through rather drastic divergence the
pa\~nchAkhyAnaka of the Jainas. The pa\~nchAkhyAnaka recombining with
older versions of the PT seems to have given rise to pUrNabhadra
variant, in the hands of the eponymous Jaina achArya. A divergent
variant of this appears to have been inserted within the ancestral
northern bR^ihatkatha and is preserved in the two descendent variants
prepared by the Kashmirian brAhmaNas kShemendra \[bR^ihatkatha
ma\~njari\] and somadeva \[kathasaritsAgara\]  
2\) The southern pa\~nchatantra is the shortest version of the text and
its primary descendent was that of the south Indian brAhmaNa vasubhAga,
who recombined it with material from the southern recension of the
bR^ihatkatha to make his text. The version of vasubhAga was transported
to Thailand and Indonesia and gave rise to the local versions there.
Another variant of the Southern PT, showing an inversion of volume 1 and
2 was prepared by the medieval smArta brAhmaNas of Tamil Nad from the
version of vasubhAga. This version was carried by these brAhmaNas during
their northward migration to the region of Pashupatinath in Nepal and
degenerated into the Nepali version. A version of this also found its
way to Bengal where it was recast by nArAyaNa to constitute the
hitopadesha.

The tales also traveled west via the Iranians of the Sassanian empire
and was eventually incorporated into many Arabic and European folk
tales. Thus, based on the investigations of the early western
pa\~nchatantra scholars Edgerton and Hertel it may be remarked that it
was the most widely circulated piece of literature throughout the
ancient world and provides a remarkable material for the evolutionary
studies on textual memetics.

When we attempt to pierce the veil and look into the Indic precursors of
it we find ourselves drawn to that great fountain of all Indic lore the
itihAsa, particularly the mahAbhArata. In a very general sense the PT
inherits from the Mbh the great Indo-Aryan innovation of nested
structure of stories. Thus these stories resemble certain other
structure in existence such as: 1) the modular computer programs- with
different FOR, WHILE, IF etc loops closed by some delimiter such as a
‘{}’ pair. 2) The structure of chromosomes, with mobile elements
inserted one within another. 3) The ancient multi-domain protein which
show nesting of domains one within the other. In a more direct sense
precursors of the PT can be seen in that great interminable death-bed
lecture of bhIshma to yuddhiSThira. Here the kuru grandsire narrates
several animal stories related to nIti. These include the maxims of
dharma and artha provided by the following tales: 1) long-necked camel
killed by the jackal couple. 2) tale of the wise mouse palita and his
rivals the cat lomasha, the owl chandraka and mongoose harita. 3) the
jIvAjivaka bird pujani that blinded the pa\~nchala prince for killing
her son. 4) The pativrata pigeon etc. An examination of these tales
makes it clear that it was such a base that inspired that great work of
viShNusharman and it is not without reason that he acknowledges the
great scion of parAshara, the compiler of the great bhArata epic. Not
surprisingly it also inspired stream of Buddhist tales, the jAtakas.
Thus one of the greatest exports of the Hindus to the world may be
ultimately traced back to the literary innovations when of the first
great Indic unification under the kuru and the pa\~nchAla.

**“Be it a horse, a science, or a sword,  
A lute, a voice, a woman or a man;  
Whether they become useful or not  
Depends on the competence of the man  
To whom they belong”**  
So says viShNusharman
