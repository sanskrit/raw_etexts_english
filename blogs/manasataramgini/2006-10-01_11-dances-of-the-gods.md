title = "11 dances of the gods."

+++
The silapadhikAraM (6.44), the great champu written in the dramiDa
language, mentions 11 dances that, as far as I know, have no mention in
the literature in deva-bhAShA. We do not know if these were once
prevalent over jambu-dvIpa and later became extinct. While many of the
themes are clear it is hard to understand all the details from the
archaic dramiDa. Dixitar’s translation clarifies most of them pretty
well.  
1\) The koDukoTTi: It was danced by shiva, with umA keeping the tAla
beside him, in the grave yard where bhAratI had danced with faultless
rhythm and avoiding wrong tAla-s, when the great fire-tipped arrow had
obeyed his command to destroy the tripura at the request of the devas.  
2\) The pANDaranga- This dance was done by shiva in the form of bhAratI
(\!) before the 4 faced brahma who was driving his car.  
3\) The alliyam- This was performed by the collyrium colored viShNu
after exposing the evil devices of kaMsa.  
4\) The mallu- This was performed by viShNu after cutting the hands of
bANAsura.  
5\) The tuDi- this was performed by kumAra in the middle of the ocean
after he killed the demon shUrapadma, who was hiding in the middle of
the ocean. \[As far as I know the killing of this demon termed
shUrapadma is a exclusively Dravidian development of the kumAra cycle.
In all devabhASha AkhyAna-s, except recent ones back-translated from
dramiLa, only tAraka and not shUrapadma is mentioned\]  
6\) The kuDai- This was performed by kumAra after lowering the umbrella
before the danavas routed by him in battle. \[dramiDa commentators state
that kumAra shielded himself with his umbrella and danced in derision at
having pounded tAraka and his hordes.\]  
7\) The kuDaM- viShNu danced this after striding through the city of
bANAsura.  
8\) The pEDi- kAma turning into a hermaphrodite form is supposed to have
danced this.  
9\) marakkAl- This was the dance of viShNumAyA (mahAkAlI) when she
sought to suppress the evil dAnavas.  
10\) pAvai- This was the dance displayed by lakShMI when she faced the
demons.  
11\) kaDayaM- This is the dance of indrANI in the fields outside the
northern gates of the city.
