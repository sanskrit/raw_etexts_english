title = "skanda prINanaM of the sAmavedic tradition"

+++
We had earlier see how the R^igvedic hymns have been [adapted for the
worship of
kumAra](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/10/18/vedic-mantras-adapted-for-kaumara-ritual/) as
specified in the Kashmirian kaumAra ritual of the kaTha yajurvedin-s.
The [devI-bhAgavataM states that the worship of
ShaShThi](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/the-vrata-of-our-dear-goddess/)
is connected with the kauthuma school of the sAmaveda. When one digs
into the roots of this tradition one arrives at the sAmavidhAna
brAhmaNa, a peculiar vidhAna work of the sAmavedins which is termed a
brAhmaNa. It provides a series of gAna-s termed the skandasya saMhitA,
which are to be used in the pacification or worship of kumAra. The
association of skanda with the late sAmavedic tradition is not
unprecedented given that he is mentioned in the last section of the
chAndogya upaniShat as the teacher of nArada. nArada is also a primary
teacher of the sAmavidhAna brAhmaNa lineage.

The skandasya saMhitA consists of 11 gAna-s all drawn from the grAmageya
gAna-s:  
1-3 (GG246) – the agnervaMrAni  
These 3 songs are composed on the following R^ik of vishvAmitra:  
A mandrair indra haribhir yAhi mayUra-romabhiH |  
mA tvA kechin ni yaman viM na pAshino.ati dhanveva tAnihi || (RV
3.45.1)  
come here indra, with your golden horses, exhilarated, with tails like a
peacock’s feathers. Let one stop you course like noose-wielders trap the
bird, pass over them as though going the coast.  
This mantra appears to have been chosen because of the term
“mayUra-romabhiH” which reminds one of the peacock vAhana of skanda.

4-6 (GG269) -the shAkrANi  
These 3 songs are composed on the R^ik of the kANva-s:  
A no vishvAsu havya indraH samatsu bhUShatu |  
upa brahmANi savanAni vR^itrahA paramajyA R^ichIShamaH || (RV8.90.1)  
May indra, who in battles must be invoked, be on our side;  
may the killer of vR^itra, the wielder of greatest power, praised by
R^iks, come to the soma pressing and chanting of mantras.  
This mantra appears to have been chosen because of reference to battle-
kumAra being the war-god.

7-9 (GG533) – the kutsasya-adhIrathIyA  
These songs are composed on the R^ik:  
pra senAnIH shUro agre rathAnAM gavyanneti harShate asya senA |  
bhadrAn kR^iNvan-nindrahavAn sakhibhya A somo vastrA rabhasAni datte ||
(RV9.96.1)  
The hero proceeds in the forefront of the chariots, the commander of the
army, he captures wealth as his army rejoices. soma dyes his robes with
good colors, and makes his friends’ invocation of indra successful.  
This mantra appears to have been chosen because of the term senAnI.
kumAra is called senAnI and is the leader of the army of the gods. This
is the most appropriate of the hymns for this particular context.

10,11 (GG565) – the arka puShpa  
These two, also deployed in the pravargya rite are composed on:  
pavitraM te vitataM brahmaNaspate prabhur gAtrANi paryeShi vishvataH |  
atapta tanUr na tad Amo ashnute shR^itAsa id vahantastat samAshata ||
(RV9.83.1)  
Your soma-filter is spread out, O brahmaNaspati, as the lord you enter
its limbs from all over.  
The raw, unheated mass does not attain this \[filter\]; only the
well-cooked mass, which bears \[the active soma\], attains it.

Originally this mantra refers to the process of the boiled soma being
filtered for the juice. However, it might have been adapted for kaumara
worship because of the word “brahmaNaspate”. After all kumAra is
brahmaNya deva.
