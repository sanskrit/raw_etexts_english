title = "The battle with the AkrAnta"

+++
The ari-s had always wished evil to befall us and tried a dreadful
prayoga that unleashed the grAhin on us. We were tormented by the grAhin
even as we headed to the rudhira-sIma. But we invoked skanda to come to
our aid. One the first day the grAhin of our ari-s seemed to keep us
down. But on the second the darts of kumAra expressed their miraculous
effects and the grAhin could not even near us. Seeing this the ari-s
decided to try the other subversive attack that they had been plotting
for long against us. For two days our dUradR^iShTi had been hampered,
but again kArttikeya enabled us to regain this. At this point we were
able to uncover the ari-s evil moves. The slow movements of the amAtya
and the sachiva were a matter that was bogging us to a degree. We also
obtained intelligence that the ari-s were working heard to revive the
grAhin around 1.30 AM.

As expected we were attacked by the revived grAhin of the pashu-s. With
the aid of Jx we reached the temple of kArttikeya and duly propitiated
the fierce god. In the coming few days we expect the full-fledged clash
with the AtatAyin developing even as the amAtya and sachiva are retreat
to kantapura amongst the AngalIka-s.
