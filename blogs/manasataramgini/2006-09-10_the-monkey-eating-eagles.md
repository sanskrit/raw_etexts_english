From when I was a kid one part of the rAmAyaNa that thrilled me was the
battle between the eagle-king jaTAyu and rAvaNa in the daNDaka forest

That lord of the eagles blew off the flame-like armor of Ravana with
both of his wings.

The eagle also cut down the the pishAcha-faced mules yoked to the car of
Ravana which were covered in glowing armor.

Then the eagle shattered that great chariot decorated with gems glowing
like the sacrificial fire with all its parts.

The eagle swiftly smashed the parasol with decorations glowing like a
full moon, and the fans together with the demons operating them.

Again mighty and regal king of the birds tore off the big head of the
charioteer of rAvaNa with his beak.

For those who know of eagles there is no surprise in the above
description of vAlmIki narrating the battle between rAvaNa and jaTAyU.
Eagles are born killers taking down victims of all sizes. The golden
eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is the most notorious of these. In Central
Asia they were used by Turko-Mongols to guard their lifestock and are
known to kill wolves outright in fierce aerial attacks. Elsewhere golden
eagles have been known to kill cows and deer. In the Mediterranean the
golden eagles have adopted an unusual method of killing the strongly
armored tortoises – they catch them and drop them onto rocks to shatter
them. They fly after the falling tortoises so that they do not miss them
as they bounce of. It is said that the Greek poet Aeschylus was killed
when an eagle dropped a tortoise on his bald pate.

But the most enigmatic of the great killer eagles are the so called
monkey-eating eagles. Different versions of these are found in most
places where primates are found and specialize in killing primates in
tropical and equatorial forest habitats. In South America we have the
Harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) which feeds on sloths and New world
monkeys, in Africa we have the crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus)
which specializes on a variety of monkeys including the large mangabey,
in Madagascar there was the recently extinct (Stephanoaetus mahery) that
preyed on lemurs, and in Phillipines we have the mighty Phillipine eagle
(*Pithecophaga jefferyi*) that in addition to monkeys also eats civets,
large snakes and Varanus lizards. The fact that in different tropical
niches there has been a primate specializing eagle is interesting. These
eagles appear to be pinnacle of dinosaurian evolution being able to
tackle highly intelligent mammalian prey in rather extraordinary niches.
Primates are rather abundant in these niches but not easy prey, even for
most mammalian predators. But the eagles have evolved a unique set of
abilities to track primates on the forest floor or on trees and control
their flight in the dense forests to take their prey. Most of these
eagles are relatively long-lived birds living up to 60-70 years and are
often monogamous for life bearing a single offspring once in every few
years. As a result their populations are low and are currently very rare
birds. They also have a peculiar breeding practise of getting fresh
green twigs to their large nests. Some speculate this twigs might
contain anti-parasitic properties and help to rid the nests of
parasites.

A recent study by McGraw et al throws considerable light on the
predatory behavior of the African crowned eagle. By studying bones in
their nests they were able to show that about half of their entire prey
is exclusively monkeys. Of this about a third were the relatively rare
ground dwelling mangabeys that could weigh upto 11 Kgs. The
distributions suggested that the eagles specifically targeted these
larger monkeys. Injuries suggested the eagles rapidly killed the monkey
by puncturing their skulls with their talons. The scraps on nearly all
shoulder bones suggested that the eagle pinned them down by the
shoulder, before/while puncturing the skull. Then they tore the prey to
pieces and transported the pieces to their nests. The beak marks suggest
that they broke through the eye sockets or base of the skull to eat the
brain and broke of the tops of long bones to extract marrow. This
clinches the idea of Berger and Clarke that the famous
australopithecine, the Taung Child, was a killed by an eagle, most
probably the same Stephanoaetus coronatus. The injuries to the Taung
skull are identical to those seen in the monkey victims and the
mammalian bone assemblage produced in the Taung cave was most probably
made by a large nesting eagle. Thus, our early ancestors appear to have
been prey for this large African eagle and it would be of interest to
see how this might have affected primate evolution.

In New Zealand, which was an avian paradise, before the coming of the
destructive Maoris, we encounter another giant eagle, the Haast’s eagle
that specialized in hunting the largest birds of the island, the moa.
Interestingly, though it is one of the largest eagles ever known, it
evolved recently through an explosive increase in size from the smallest
eagle, the little eagle (Hieraaetus morphnoides) found in New Guinea and
Australia. In Australia there is the fairly large Wedge-tail eagle,
which working in groups has been known to kill adult kangaroos. Thus, in
practically every continent we have a specialized major eagle predator.
However, strangely in India, the land of garuDa and jaTAyU, where there
is an abundance of monkeys in the tropical forests we encounter no
monkey-eating eagles. Why this is so is a mystery. May be we need to
investigate if there were at least fossil forms.
