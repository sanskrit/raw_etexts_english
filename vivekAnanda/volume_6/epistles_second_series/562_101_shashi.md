HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM, READING,  
*3rd July, 1896.*

DEAR SHASHI,

Send Kali to England as soon as you get this letter. . . . He will have
to bring some books for me. I have only got Rig-Veda Samhitâ. Ask him to
bring the Yajur-Veda, Sâma-Veda, Atharva-Samhita, as many of the
Brâhmanas as he can get, beginning with the Shatapatha, some of the
Sutras, and Yâska's Nirukta. . . .

Let there be no delay as in Sharat's case, but let Kali come at once.
Sharat has gone to America, as he had no work to do here. That is to
say, he was late by six months, and then when he came, I was here. . . .

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
