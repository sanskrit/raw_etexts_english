title = "The long drawn encounter"

+++
We repulsed another attack on our position by the brigade from
dundubhidurga. Seeing that dundudbhidurga was strategically placed to
fire rockets at us, we decided to use the confusion of our foe to take
the fort. I set out with a force of commandos and attacked
dundubhidurga. We detonated a part of the wall an got in. We face some
opposition but as our men had taken the commanding heights we were able
to kill the defenders. We destroyed much of the defending party and a
few survivors go away. We are however in a quandry as to whether to
garrison the fort or simply blow it up. We still have a few days to
decide, but the news reached us that our ally in suvarNapura was facing
a grim assault. If he is overthrown we may face a dire situation and may
need to withdraw any garrison placed for this fort. If we blow up the
fort we simply may have no leverage on the enemy territory. The enemy
had cleverly moved all their supplies and resources from dundubhidurga-
so in a sense it was an empty conquest.
