## HOLD ON YET A WHILE, BRAVE HEART

(Written to H. H. The Maharaja of Khetri, Rajputana.)

If the sun by the cloud is hidden a bit,  
If the welkin shows but gloom,  
Still hold on yet a while, brave heart,  
       The victory is sure to come.

No winter was but summer came behind,  
Each hollow crests the wave,  
They push each other in light and shade;  
       Be steady then and brave.

The duties of life are sore indeed,  
And its pleasures fleeting, vain,  
The goal so shadowy seems and dim,  
Yet plod on through the dark, brave heart,  
      With all thy might and main.

Not a work will be lost, no struggle vain,  
Though hopes be blighted, powers gone;  
Of thy loins shall come the heirs to all,  
Then hold on yet a while, brave soul,  
      No good is e'er undone.

Though the good and the wise in life are few,  
Yet theirs are the reins to lead,  
The masses know but late the worth;  
     Heed none and gently guide.

With thee are those who see afar,  
With thee is the Lord of might,  
All blessings pour on thee, great soul,  
     To thee may all come right!
