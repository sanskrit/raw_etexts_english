<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">The Devotee-Subrat</p>
<p class="Text">There was an amiable Brahman, named Som Sharma. His wife’s name was Suman. Subrat was his son. It was was the blessing of the Lord that the Brahman couple got such a God-devotee son. Along with the son, the Brahman’s family was blessed with the prosperity also. In the previous birth, Subrat was a devotee prince, named Dharmagad. For the pleasure of his father he had sacrifised his head even. By virtue of the practice of the previous birth, he had started contemplating and meditating the Lord since his childhood. When he played with other boys, he used to call his mates with the names of ‘Hari, Govind, Mukund, Madhav’ in the name of the Lord. He had named his all the friends according to the Lord’s name. He called—Brother Keshav, Madhav, Chakradhar, come on-come on! Purushottam! Come on. Let us play. Madhusudan! Accompany me. While playing-eating, seeing-hearing, reading-writing, smiling-speaking, sleeping-awakening, eating-drinking everytime he perceived the Lord only before him. Inside the house, outside, on any vehicle, in the mind, in the wisdom—in any action, at every place, he saw the view of the Lord and he used to call Him. He used to see the glimpse of Govind’s lotus-eyes in the straw, wood, stone and dry and wet all the objects. He used to be satisfied to see the charming appearance of the Lord’s lotus-face in the water-land, sky-earth, forest-mountain, animate-inanimate all the beings. Even in his childhood, he had learnt to sing and daily by singing in the melodious sweet musical tone the Lord’s attributes in His praise he developed his love in the Lord Shri Krishna. He sang—</p>
<p class="Text">‘I am in the shelter of the Lord of the Supreme Lord Madhusudan, who is meditated by the savants of the Vedas constantly, where each and every part infinite crores of universes exist, who is the destroyer of all the sins. I am in the shelter of the Lord, who is the Lord of all the beings, in whom all the worlds exist. I salute the lotus-feet of the Supreme Lord free from all the vices, who is the treasure of all the divine attributes, I salute His lotus-feet constantly; I seek shelter to the Lord Shri Narayan to get deliverance from this boundless sea. May the Lord’s broad pious lotus-feet, the destroyer of the demons, which are the swan of the mind of the foremost ascetics of Yogic practice, which influence and glory is constant and omnipresent, protect the destitute like me! I meditate that Supreme truth, God of gods, the preceptor of the universe—the Supreme Lord, who is the moon to remove the darkness of sorrow, who has made the public well-being His religion, who is the master of the whole universe. I sing with musical and melodious tune the divine merits of the great and glorious Lord of bliss whose memorisation is like the sun for the blossoming of the lotus of knowledge, who is the sole God of adoration of all the worlds. I am always lying in the shelter of the Lord Keshav, whose viewing appearance is beyond the reach of evil doers. Thus, singing in this way, Subrat danced clapping with his hands and enjoyed with the other boys. This was the sport of His daily routine. Remaining absorbed in the meditation of the Lord in this way, he used to play with the children. He had not conscious of his eating and drinking. Then, the mother Suman called him and said—‘Son! You must be feeling hungry. Just see, your face is faded due to hunger. Come on, make haste, eat something.’ Hearing the words of the mother, Subrat said—‘Mother! I am feeling contented to drink the nectar-juice falling in drops in the meditation of Shri Hari.’ When she brought him with pressure and he sat to eat, he said to see the sweet food—‘This food is the Lord Himself, the soul depends on food. The soul is also the same Lord. May the Lord in the form of soul be contented with the food in the form of the Lord! May the Lord, who always lives in the ocean of milk be, contented with this water in the form of the Lord! May the all supreme Lord be contented with betel, sandal and these charming fragrant flowers!’ When the virtuous Subrat went to sleep, contemplating Shri Krishna, he said—‘I am in the shelter of Shri Krishna, endowed with Yogic-sleep.’ Thus, in all the actions of eating, wearing, sleep, eating etc., he remembered the Lord and offered everything to him. This is the condition of his childhood.</p>
<p class="Text">When he grew up young, he went away on the Baidurya hill on the south bank of the river Narmadaji having abandoned all the sense objects and he engaged himself in the meditation of the Lord. When one hundred years passed in the constant practice of penance in this way, the Lord along with Lakshmiji appeared. It was really a wonderful glimpse. The dark-blue body was embellished with the divine yellow garment and ornaments. His three hands were adorned with conch, discus and mace. With his fourth lotus hand in His fearless countenence the Lord was blessing Subrat with fearlessness. He said—‘Son Subrat! Rise, rise, may it be your the highest good! See, I, Shri Krishna, Myself, is present before you. Rise, accept the boon.’</p>
<p class="Text">Subrat opened his eyes to hear the divine speech of the Lord. He remained gazing only to see the divine image of the Lord before him. In the emotion of joy, his whole body got horripilated. It was the spontaneous overflow of the tears of joy from his eyes. Then, with folded hands, he said in the pitious voice—</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-3">‘O Janardan! This world-sea is terribly fierece. The terrible and stormy waves of sorrow and misery are rising in it, it is splashing with the waves of infatuation. I am lying entangled with the sea-waves due to my vices. I am helpless. Emancipate me from this great ocean. The black clouds of evil deeds are thundering and have been raining cats and dogs the rain of sorrows. It is the fierce lightning of the accumulated sins. O Madhusudan! I have become blind in the darkness of infatuation. Nothing is visible to me, I am very meek, protect me, O Lord! With the support of your lotus hands. This world is a great dreadful forest. This is rich with the trees of the different types of numerous sorrows. It is full of the lions and tigers of infatuation. The forest conflagration is flaring up My consciousness, O Shri Krishna! I am burning badly in it, Protect me. This ancient world-tree is surrounded with the branches of the pathos and countless sorrows. The Maya is its root. The attachments of wife-son etc., are its leaves. O Murari! Having climbed up the tree, I have fallen down, save me. I am burning in the fierce fire of the sorrows of the different kinds of attachments. I remain drowning in the anguish day and night. Support me to get rid of it. Provide me peace with the flowing water of the knowledge of Your grace. My Lord! This deep ditch of the world is covered with the darkness. I am feeling very much terrified lying in it. Please, bless with Your grace to this destitute. I have come to Your shelter being detached from the world. Those, who let their mind remain concentrated in You constantly with great love, who meditate You, attain You. The gods and the demigods contemplate Him continuously bowing their heads in His great holy feet. Lord! I, too, neither discuss about others, nor serve them nor I contemplate of them. I always remain engaged in the congregational singing of Your name, devotional song of Your attributes and virtues and in remembering You, I salute Your auspicious feet constantly. Shri Krishna! Fulfil my ambition of heart. Bless me that the entire heap of my sins may be destroyed. I am Your slave, Your servant. Bless me with Your such grace that wherever I am born, I may be remaining always engaged in the contemplation of Your lotus feet. Shri Krishna! If You are pleased with me, grant me the supreme boon. O the God of gods! Provide me including my mother, and father Your Supreme abode! After such a prayer, Subrat became silent. Then, Lord Shri Krishna said—‘It will be so. Your ambition will be fulfilled.’ Having uttered so, the Lord disappeared and Subrat in the embodied form along with his father, Som Sharma and the mother, Sumana made the auspicious journey of the Lord’s eternal abode.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">The Devotee-Vaishvanar</p>
<p class="Text">In the ancient time on the holy bank of the pious river, Narmada, there was a very charming but a small village. A virtuous celibate, named Vaishvanar lived there in this village. He was a fine Brahman of Shandilya clan. There was a divine glow on his face, he was self-restraint, his heart was pure and generally, he remained alwayes engaged in the self-study of the Vedas. His distinctive characteristic was that he was an exclusive devotee of the Lord Shankar. This is the fruit of the self-study of the Vedas.</p>
<p class="Text">When in the first of the four stages of life, he finished the study of the Vedas and all the auxiliary of the Vedas, He desired to enter the worldly practical life. He should come to the practical field of life with the penance whatever he has practised for so long days, self-study, contemplation and deep thinking and test its practical use in common behaviour. Side by side, the question arose in his mind what stage of the four stages of life he should adopt in his life and he should use and pull on his life accordingly. Keeping in the centre of his meditation of Lord Shankar, he began to think—‘Which stage of the four stages of life is benedictory for me? Should I lead the life of an ascetic or the life of renunciation in accordance with my mental condition? What is the merit and demerit in both the ways of life? Which one is superior? While pondering over in his mind, he began to appreciate the life of of a householder.’</p>
<p class="Text">Vaishvanar thought to himself ‘The domestic life only is the base of other three stages of life. gods, ancestors, man and animals-birds all take shelter to the householders. Bath, offering to the fire and charity are the essential rituals for a householder. There is no hurdle of any type for muttering divine name in the householder’s life. The mind is fickle by nature. The mind of a householder remains confined to a woman. The wife is an armour for the protection of character. If, I remain unmarried; if I remain in the garb of a celibate showing obstinacy, due to public slander or selfishness and the lust and the intense desires of sexuality are created in the mind or go on disturbing our mind always then, what is the meaning of this celibacy? If a householder does not cast an evil eye on another’s wife and remains satisfied with his own wife only and enjoys sexual intercourse just after the menstrual period only, he is a celibate at all despite being a householder. Those, who live a domestic life with moral conduct being totally free from attachment and aversion lead a superior life to the life of an ascetic even. In the momentary emotion of renunciation, if anyone abandons his home but remains thinking of his family affairs, he does not get any fruit of his sacrifice. The housekeeper, who does not demand anything from anyone and remains happy in any condition depending on the God’s will only, is much better than those Sanyasi who beg for any other object other than the alms for meal. So, I should adopt the domestic life.’</p>
<p class="Text">The study of the Shastras, the purity of innerself and the Lord’s devotion—all these three are the good thoughts and the fruit of good decision. Having the consideration of his mental condition and fitness he determined that he must marry and live a domestic life. On an auspicious moment, he married a noble girl of his match and began to pass his time in the memory and contemplation of the Lord following the moral conduct according to the domestic life. His wife’s name was Shuchishmati. She served her husband considering him God. The five great sacrificial deeds—The worship and service of the God, manes and guests specially was performed daily. The time of their worship and earning was fixed. Their every action was motivated with sense of righteousness. His wife supported him in his every activity without any hesitation. They were physically separate but one soul. They were leading a happy life. Lord’s love upsurged in the heart of the both. Thus, sufficient time passed.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, Shuchishmati thought—‘Yet we are issueless. The issue is the manifested form of the married couple’s love. For the happiness of this world and the next world both there is the need of issue. The son is the union of the both—wife and husband, so, we must have an issue.’ Thinking so, Shuchishmati made a prayer to her husband—‘O the son of Arya race! O the Lord of my life! By the power of the service of your lotus feet nothing is unobtainable to me. Whatever the objects are needed to me, are available to me by your grace. Yet there is an ambition in my mind which is the need of a domestic life, kindly, fulfil my ambition.’ Vaishvanar said—‘Beloved! You are my better half, you are my associate, there is nothing with me which cannot be given to you. By the grace of Lord Shankar, nothing is rare for me. It is only the delay in your demand and not in your gain.’ Shuchishmati said—‘My love! I know that you are the exclusive devotee of the Lord Shankar and deserve His favour. I want nothing, this is my only desire that I may be mother of a son like the Lord Shankar.’ To hear the words of his wife, Vaishvanar became silent for a moment. He thought—‘Such a prayer was beyond my imagination even. Probably, it is the Lord Shankar’s inspiration through the mouth of my wife. Well! Let His ambition be fulfilled.’ Thinking so in his mind, he said to his wife—‘It will be so.’ Then, after assurance to his wife, he made the journey of Kashi.</p>
<p class="Text">Kashi is the permanent abode of the Lord Shankar. Just reaching Kashi, Vaishvanar was free from all the three worldly afflictions, the mental impressions of his hundreds of births were washed away. After taking bath in the Ganga, he viewed and worshipped the different Shiv’s stone phallus. After the sacrifice with a philanthropic motive, he fed hundreds of Brahmans and saints. Now, he began to think—‘Every particle of Kashi is Shiv’s stone phallus, by worshipping the image of which Shiv’s stone phallus, I should attain my goal? So many names of the places and idols came to his mind and passsed away. At last, he decided to worship Vireshwar. Many men and women have got their ambitions fulfilled by the worship of Vireshwar. Panchashwar Gandharva had accomplished their wish here. The fairy Kokilalapa had merged into it while dancing with emotional heart. The sage Vedashira had merged with his apparent body in this same spell—luminous Shiv’s stone phallus while reciting ‘Shatarudri’. Jayadrath had attained the kingdom from here. Vidurath had been bestowed with son from here. Vasudeva Vaishya had got wife from here. Several perfect persons have got salvation from here. I will worship Him  only, by His service and adoration, I will attain Him as my son. With such a determination in his mind, Vaishvanar engaged himself in the Lord’s adoration.</p>
<p class="Text">He worshipped the Lord for thirteen months. Sometimes, he ate something once only in the day, sometimes he used to remain satisfied to eat whatever he got without begging, sometimes he passed the day only on milk, sometimes on fruits. Someimes he took nothing. He passed a month only to eat a handful of sesame seed simply every day. He passed some months only to drink water and in some months not even that. In this way, by the practice of dire penance, he passed twelve month. In the thirteeth month one day, after taking bath in the Ganga, he came to worship the Lord. When he saw towards the idol a child was visible in the middle of the Shiva’s-stone-phallus. He seemed to be eight years old. There was the paste of ashes in his whole body. His eyes were broad and his lips were red. The head was embellished with matted yellow hair and there was a smile on his face. His body was naked without any garment. With his playful smile, he was bewitching the mind. This child was not a child, but apparent Lord Shankar. Vaishvanar fell down on His feet to recognise his deity and bathed Him with the tears of his eyes. With the thrilled body and choked throat and with the palms joined together he made prayer—‘Lord! I belong to You. I salute Your feet. There is no other object uniform except You. You are the creator of all. You are uniform to all, identical and without any form. After the knowledge of Your form, the discrimination of the world remains no more. It is You in different forms, it is You the coolness of water, the heat of the fire, the scorching brightness of the sun and the nectar of sweet-moon light. It is You the fragrance in delicate flowers and the sweet cream in the milk. You are with form and formless both wtih organs and without organs both, with attributes and without attributes both. It is You only to know Your real form. Child-old, appearance—without any form—all it is You.’ While saying in this way, Vaishvanar fell down on the feet of the Lord Shankar. Lord Shankar said—‘Demand whatever you desire.’ Vaishvanar said—‘Lord! You are omniscient; what is unknown to You? First, committed a guilt to have an ambition and secondly, You are asking to beg! Begging is the form of penury. Why are You inducing me for this knowingly?’ The Lord Shankar said—‘Your ambition will be fulfilled. To fulfil the desire of Shuchishmati, the penance you have performed is quite proper. I will be your son in one of My forms. My name will be Grihapati, Agni or Vaishvanar.’ Having uttered so, the Lord Shankar disappeared and remembering the Lord with great joy, Vaishvanar returned home.</p>
<p class="Text">On the due time, Shuchishmati became pregnant. Vaishvanar performed all the rites. All the three worlds rejoiced with merriment on the day the son was born. With the wavering of cool mild fragrant air all the directions were scented. The clouds anointed all the creatures with the juice of fragrance of all the flowers of Nandanavan. The auspicious earth began to circulate a supernatural. pleasure in the heart of everyone resounding with the divine echo—the nymphs began to dance, the demigods began to sing. The foremost seers—Marich, Pulastya, Atri etc., and the foremost gods—Brahma, Vishnu all in total appeared at the house of Vaishvanar. Lord Shankar, Himself alongwith Parvati came to see the birth ceremony of His particular part’s incarnation. The Lord Brahma, Himself, performed the ceremony of the birth of the newly born baby and fulfilled his naming ceremony according to the ‘Shruti’. The infant was named Grihapati. By making the management of the child’s protection, Brahma, Vishnu and Shankar—all the three went away to their abode. At that time, there was the only voice coming out of everyone’s mouth—‘The appearance of this child is extraordinary and so admirable, his lustre is so supernatural and the Shuchishmati’s womb is blessed. When this ceremony was over, everyone even on reaching home remained saying—‘If the son is born, he should be such a child, such a child endowed with all the noble merits was never visible.’ The joy of the mother-father was beyond description. Their deity, Himself had come before them in the form of their son. They were engaged in looking after and fondling the child in such a way that they forgot the fact that he was the part of Lord Shankar or the fruit of His grace. They considered him only their fondled child. They remained always worried that cold or heat might not catch him, he might not suffer by any way. It is true that the charm of sportive display always covers up the godhood.</p>
<p class="Text">In the fifth year of the age, after the sacred-thread ceremony he started the study of the Vedas. Grihapati Vaishvanar was not a common child that he should take so many years more in the study. The preceptor was already influenced by the virtues of his modesty etc., and his supernatural talent. By making the preceptor only as witness Vaishvanar studied all the entire portions of knowledge from the beginning to the end himself. After the complete study of all the fields of knowledge in Shastras only within three years—whereas for others even the reading is impossible in such a short period—Vaishvanar came back to his father and with his modesty, spirit of service, compassion etc., he amazed not only his mother-father but all the others also. This, is the only duty of the child to serve his mother-father—to obey them and modest behaviour with everyone. Vaishvanar was the expert and ideal here. Knowledge should be combined with modesty also, this is the queer mixture of gem and gold.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, moving about the foremost seer Narada visited Vaishvanar’s house at Narmpur. Shuchishmati and Vaishvanar welcomed him warmly with love and whole-hearted joy. Coming there Vaishvanar Grihapati saluted his feet. Blessing him the foremost seer Narada said to Vaishvanar praising the boy—‘Your married life is admirable. You are most fortunate to get such an obedient son. A son has no other more important duty than this. For him mother and father are his preceptor and god, their service is his moral conduct. The water of their feet is his Supreme Lord, mother is more venerable than father; because to conceive the child for ten months in her womb and to look after him in his childhood is the work of the mother. Even after the consecration with the holy water of the Ganga that purity is not attained what is got by the touch of the mother’s feet-nectar. After renunciation the son becomes worthy of adoration for the father but the mother remains adorable even for the son who has taken Sanyasa. Both of you are praiseworthy because you have got such a son of gem. When the foremost seer Narada was saying this who can presume the heartiest joy of the mother and father?</p>
<p class="Text">The foremost sage Narada said calling Vaishvanar close to him—‘Son! Come on and sit in my lap; let me mark the symptoms of your body at least.’ By the permission of the mother-father, Vaishvanar having saluted the foremost sage, Narada sat in his lap very meekly. The foremost sage Narada saw each and every symptom of his body; he saw the palate, tongue and teeth also. After then having saluted Gauri-Shankar and Ganesh, he measured the boy from feet to head standing facing north with the thread coloured in saffron. Then he said—‘O Vaishvanar! He, the length of whose body is equal to one hundred eight fingers becomes the protector and feeder of the world, your son is such as. All the thirty-two symptoms of the topmost man are there in his body. The five limbs of his body are longer than average his both the eyes, beard, knee and nose. Five limbs are subtle—skin, hair, teeth, fingers and the knots of the fingers. The three limbs of his body are short—neck, thigh and urinary organ. Voice, innerself and navel—these three are grave. The six parts of his body are elevated—bosom, stomach, mouth, forehead, shoulders and hands. The seven parts of his body are red—both the hands, the corner of both the eyes, palate, tongue, lowerlip, lips and nails. The three parts of his body are expanded—the forehead, waist and bosom. There symptoms prove that this child is a great man.’ The foremost sage Narada showed many other symptoms also to the mother-father, which proved this boy uncommon. The mother-father did not feel satisfied to hear more and more. They wanted that the foremost sage should say something more. The foremost sage also did not leave any stone unturned from his side in forecasting about his son.</p>
<p class="Text">The outstanding sage said in the last—‘All the virtues are there in this child, all the symptoms of greatness are there in him, he is spotless like moon; yet the Lord Brahma will not spare him, when the destiny does not favour all the merits turn to demerits. Now, he is running in the ninth years of age, on the twelvth year of his age, he can die by the current of electricity. Having uttered this, the foremost sage Narada went away by the space-way. It was an electric stroke on their heart as if, all the dreams of happiness, and joy shattered in a moment. ‘Oh! I have died! Uttering this Vaishvanar got fainted. Shuchishmati began to wail and cry with broken heart—‘How was this sudden thunderbolt?’ Whereas we were drowning in the sea of joy, and suddenly this terrible sight of annihilation! Had I conceived the child in my womb that my infant should be the victim of untimely death? Was this the  fruit of our sacrifice, penance and Lord’s service to please Him at last? In the end it was that he had to meet such destiny. For us only this child is our substance in this world. Our life is meaningless in his absence. O death! Is your wife barren? Will your heart not be broken into pieces at the time of your blow of thunderbolt on the delicate child like blossom? O Shankar! O the merciful Lord!! O Mrityunjay!!! If the death is dominant even on the child blessed by You, then in whom should we have faith, where should we go for shelter?’</p>
<p class="Text">As Suchishmati was wailing and crying in pathetic lamentation, there was the spontaneous overflow of tears from her eyes and hot breaths were coming out. The whole atmosphere was overcast with pathos. The hearts of the trees and creepers melted. They also could not spare themselves from the tears and sweats. All the directions burst into tears, the animals and birds got stunned. Vaishvanar came to his sense from his faint, he said—‘Where is my soul? Where is my entire? The fear of future disaster was causing them to faint, their infant, their soul, had gone nowhere. Their Vaishvanar did stand before them. But he was invisible to the eyes of the Brahman couple due to the emotion of love. This is the role of the love. Vaishvanar saw that his mother and father were grieving. He said smiling—‘Mother! Why are you so much afraid of? So long as the dust of your lotus-feet is on my head, even the death cannot touch me. My most affectionate the venerable ones! I, today, promise and take an oath that if I am your son, I will present such an example that the thunderbolt is also ineffective and god of death both will remain frightened from me. I will worship the Lord Mrityunjay. The killer of death, nothing is impossible by His grace.’ What was the speech of Vaishvanar, that was the rain of nectar. It cooled the heart of mother and father. Their joys had no bounds. They said—‘Then, speak again son! What did you say? Even the god of death cannot touch you, what is the force of thunderbolt? Yes, this is so. The way you have mentioned—the worship of the Lord Mrityunjai has such a power and such is its glory. How kind is the Lord Shankar! He has not protected only one but many others. The flaming fire of annihilation, that deadly poison which blaze could burn all the three worlds into ashes–the Lord Shankar drank it being moved with pity. Who can be more kind and merciful than he? Go, seek His shelter. His worship is the perfection of life?’ Vaishvanar saluted the feet of father and mother, assured them and having taken round of them set out on the journey of Kashi.</p>
<p class="Text">Kashi means illuminating, that may bring to light even the hidden truth. On one of its side there is the river Varun which destroys the affliction of sins of the visitors prior to their reach. On the next side there is ‘Asi’ that is the sharp-edged sword to cut the cross of sorrow, the Ganga of Kashi is only of Kashi. Kashi has as if put on the garland! Even the insects and mean creatures of Kashi attain that accomplishment which is unobtainable to the great ascetics even after the practice of Yoga of eight limbs. Every particle of Kashi is Shiva’s stone phallus. Vaishvanar’s heart flourished with the view of Kashi only. Having taken bath on the ‘Manikarnika-Ghat’, he viewed the sight of Visheshwar—such a beautiful, such a charming view! As if the Supreme Bliss had appeared in the form of that Shiva’s stone phallus. Vaishvanar thought—‘I am blessed to view the sight of Shankar, the entire substance of all the three worlds. Is it the idol full of nectar or the self-realization has itself manifested or whether this is the manifestation of the effulgence experienced in the hearts of Yogis? This is the fruit of salvation—tree or is it the bunch of the flowers of the creepers of the absolute identity with divinity? Undoubtedly, it is the seedy species of the whole universe. I am the most fortunate to get a patron by the sight of the Lord. The foremost Narada blessed me with his great grace that I could achieve the greatest accomplishment of life. I am fulfilled enough.’ Vaishvanar began to float in the flood of joyous emotions.</p>
<p class="Text">It is the Lord only who knows the secret of the devotion of the Lord. The living being of shallow knowledge cannot imagine even of a water drop from the boundless ocean of love. That is why the Lord, impelled by His kindness incarnates in the form of devotee. The devotees are never separated from the Lord. Whether the Lord displays the sport of love having appeared in the devotee’s heart or in the form of devotee—the both are the same. Today the apparent Shankar is also organising a spectacle of the devotees for the good of the living beings. This is simply a frolicsome activity for Him; but for the living beings it is a beautiful ideal of the sentiment of devotion or worship. Following this way, who is there who cannot do the highest good to self?</p>
<p class="Text">Vaishvanar established Shiva’s stone phallus at the auspicious moment. He accepted hard rules of the worship. To bring one hundred eight earthen pots filled with the water of the Ganga and to offer the whole water everyday. To offer the garland of one thousand and eight blue lotus. For six months continuously to depend on the bulbs and roots taking it only once in a week, In six months to eat dry leaves,for six months only with water and for six months only on the support of air, muttering, worship and recitation and constant contemplation of the Lord Shankar. Overwhelmed with the emotion of simple-hearted devotion. Sometimes the meditation of the divine image of the Lord bright like camphor, embellished with ashes and enclosed with snakes and sometime the prayer in choked voice with pathetic heart. Two years passed in the twinkling of eye. The comfortable and lucky days pass away in the same way. One day, when Vaishvanar was passing through the twelfth year of his age, as if to prove Narad’s words true with the thundebolt in his hand, Indra came. He said—‘Vaishvanar! I am pleased with your daily observances and devotedness. Whatever the ambition you have in your mind, disclose it to me, I will fulfil it at any cost.’ Vaishvanar said in a very soft voice—‘O the Lord of gods, Indra! I know you, You can do everything; my Lord is only Lord Shankar, I cannot accept any boon from anyone else except Him.’ Indra said—‘O the child! Why are you showing your foolishness? There is no existence of Shankar separate from me. It is I the God of gods. Whatever you want demand it from me.’ Vaishvanar said—‘To whom is your character hidden? I cannot demand any boon from anyother one except Lord Shankar.’ Indra’s face became red in anger. He frightened Vaishvanar with the dreadful thunderbolt in his hands. To see the fierce appearance of the thunderbolt which was scattering the electric flames, Vaishvanar fainted. Just at the same moment, having appeared Lord Gauri Shankar said caressing with the touch of nectarean lotus hands and reviving Vaishvanar conscious—‘Son! May it be your highest good! Rise up, rise up, just see at least who is standing before you!’  To hear the nectarial sweet speech, Vaishvanar opened his eyes and saw that the Lord Shankar, resplendent like myrads of suns was standing before him. The paste of sandal on the forehead, the dark throat, the mother of the world, Parvati on the left side; the moon-beams existed in the matted hair raining bliss. The white body like camphor wrapped with the elephant-skin and the ornaments of snakes! In the emotion of joy, Vaishvanar’s throat choked, his body gets horripilated despite the will to speak, he became speechless. Vaishvanar became still like a drawn picture. He forgot his own being. Neither salutation, nor hymn nor prayer. On one side, Gauri Shankar and the next side, Vaishvanar. Vaishvanar was amazed, the Lord Shankar was smiling.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-3">The Lord Shankar broke the silence. He said—‘Child Vaishvanar! Were you frightened to see the thunderbolt of Indra! Don’t be afraid of, it was I who wanted to test you in the guise of Indra. Those who are My affectionate devotees are already My form. The thunderbolt of Indra or the God of death Yama even can assail no harm to my devotee at all. I can fulfil your desire whatever are there in your heart. I offered you the position of ‘fire’. You will be the mouth of all the gods. All the gods will take their share only through you. The bodies of all the beings will be your dwelling place. Indra is the overlord of east and Yamaraj is of the south. You, live as the over lord of the middle of the both. Since, today, you are the overlord of ‘Igneous angle’. Along with your father, mother and brothers go to ‘Igneous world’ by the aeroplane and fulfil your job according to your position.’ That the moment  Lord Shankar said this, Vaishvanar’s mother, father, brothers, kiths and kins all happened to present there. Along with all having saluted Lord Shankar’s feet Vaishvanar  went away to his world-Igneous and Lord Shankar entered the same stone phallus which Vaishvanar worshipped. The Lord Shankar, Himself, has praised highly this stone phallus.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">The Devotee-Padmanabh</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is the embodiment of mercy. He goes on showering the rain of mercy constantly on the whole universe, there is no discriminations of any kind from His side. In His experience whatever the delay is, that is from the side of the living being only and not from the Lord side. Any moment when the living being turns towards to experience His grace with the true sentiment of his consciousness, he can feel His boundless grace the very moment. Sometimes even in the absence of the eagerness of the soul the Lord makes him feel of His grace all of a sudden, here is the best effort of the embodied being that he should experience the Lord’s grace. It does not need any special practice. It requires only faith. What was that penance that the potter Bhim performed? He used to offer the Lord only the basil-leaf, fruit and flowers made of earth by him; only this pleased Him and He bestowed His favour to him. What a big ascetic the farmer Vasu was? He simply made the farming of a little millet and offering the same he kept himself satisfied with its remaining. Only this much pleased Him and He became the idol of his worship forever. That Rangadas of lower caste, how much was he restless for Him? He came for the purification of his single mental fault. The Lord’s sportive display is strange. It is only He who knows with whom, when and why He is pleased! But it is certain that He is personified compassion and he who wants to attain Him whole-heartedly, to Him He does meet.</p>
<p class="Text">India is the source of saints. It is not at all possible to count the number of saints born here. Each and every holy place of pilgrimage has produced so many devotee saints. The pilgrimages are the far fetched affairs, there would be hardly any village which did not produce any saint. Venkatachal is as if the Vaikuntha for the devotees. The major portions of the Puranas are full of the glory of the devotees who are born there. Even now in the good for nothing times Venkatachal is so beautiful and attractive that on the visit there any emotional person is entranced once to stay there.</p>
<p class="Text">The mountain peaks full of greenary, the ‘Akash-Ganga’, Swami Pushkarani, Chakratirth are such spots which are Sattvika by nature and each and every spot is marked with any such a memory hidden behind that stimulates the soul to advance towards Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">It is related to the ancient time. Now, there is the temple of Balaji and at some distance from there is a holy place, named ‘Chakra Pushkarni’. On its bank there used to live a Brahman, named Padmanabh belonging to ‘Shri Vats’ clan. He had neither any collection nor possession. This was the only vow of his life to mutter the Lord’s name, His remembrance only, His contemplation only. He was self-restraint, kind-hearted to the poors and grieved ones love with truth, detachment to the worldly objects and the feeling of identity with the entire living beings—this was his life. He never cared for his self joy or sorrow but his heart melted even with the imagination of others sorrow. Sometimes he remained satisfied to eat the dry leaves only and sometimes he passed the day with water only and sometimes he was absorbed so much in the Lord’s meditationthat he became oblivious of his body also, then, where was the question of eating-drinking; but this was all concerning to his outward world. His heart remained pining for the Lord. There was no value of his own life before Him. He wanted to attain his Lord, his dearest Lord, having sacrificed even hundreds of such lives. The dreadful storms of hopes and disappointments usually haunted in his heart. Sometimes he came into the realm of thoughts that ‘the Lord is very kind, He will meet me one day, it is dead sure, I will roll on His feet, I will wash His feet with my tears, He will embrace me lifting up with His lotus hands, He will put His hands on my head, He will accept me as His own and I will be sinking into the sea of His bliss. How lucky would be the moment, how charming would be the life of that time! He will say—‘Demand boon’ and I will say—‘I want nothing’, I will remain only in Your service, I will go on only watching You. You may forget or remember me but I will never forget You.’ In the realm of such emotional thoughts Padmanabh used to be overwhelmed with joy, his body got horripilated, the tears began to flow from his eyes. His such a rapturous state in love continued for a long time. He remained busy in the Lord’s service forgetting the entire world.</p>
<p class="Text">Sometimes just reverse thoughts came to his mind—‘Whereas I am a mean creature—poor-destitute, black-hearted; and on the other hand the overlord of the entire universe! Why should He come to my sinful heart? What is the discipline that I have performed which will attract Him to bless me with His appearance? Neither muttering, nor penance, nor fast nor meditation! The mind and heart that should contemplate Him, contemplates this transient world! This is a great fault, the punishment is a must. I am burning in the blaze of anguish, wandering about for the sensuous enjoyments in this world, yet hope for Lord’s attainment! If it is not my hope against hope then, what is this? What a great worry I have for this body, what a great anxiety tempts me for the sensuous enjoyments, how many times I have already wept for this world! But for the Lord I could not shed even two drops of tears! What a mockery it is! What a reverse my life is! Is this life worthy of attaining the Lord? Really, the destruction of such a life is good and proper.’ While thinking so his heart was so much pained that it seemed to him that his heart would burst. Several times he felt so much disappointed that his life seemed to be burden to him, sometimes he fainted and began to call in unconscious condition—‘O Lord! O my Master! O Purushottam! Will you not bless me with Your sight? Is it fated to me to pass away wailing—and weeping in this way? I don’t fear from death, The end of this mean life is better. But I will remain deprived of Your sight. I don’t know how many births will pass away to have  Your vision Does my pathetic voice not reach Your All-pervading ears? Make me own. Lord! Don’t look towards me but look towards Yourself.’ Thus, while making prayer in this way, he used to be unconscious and his body remained lying as it is for many hours.</p>
<p class="Text">People advise to practise penance for the Lord but what does penance mean—they don’t think of it. In the scorching heat of the May and June when the sun is scorching with all the twelve phases and to sit amidst the five or eighty-four fires or to remain stood in the cold water in the chilly winter—this is not what penance means. Penance means attonement for the self-inadvertence. Discontentment from the lower and mean condition of life and the blaze of the Lord’s separation which may cause to glitter like gold having burnt all the entire blemishes of life is the actual meaning of penance. This is the penance rarely obtainable to the gods even. Padmanabh’s life was full of such a penance and he was an ascetic in the real sense. One day, his penance reached the climax. He made prayer to the Lord with true heart, full competence—‘O Lord! Don’t tantalize me more. How long should I remain alive in the hope of your vision? A single moment is passing like the period of one Kalpa, the world looks empty and my this afflicted life, this life deprived of the Lord seems more bitter than the poison even. What is the use of these eyes which remained deprived of your sight till today? Now, it is better to be blind. If You cannot be achieved in this life then destroy I want nothing—wife, son, relatives, this world or the next world. I want only Your appearance, Your glimpse, Your service. Once, You, accept me as Your own, enough; I want this much only. Am I not the worthy of Your that grace what You bestowed upon Gaja, Ganika and Vulture? You are great merciful, you are under the spell of grace, gracefulness is Your pledge. Throw a ray of Your grace on me also.’ Thus, Padmanabh got absorbed in the rememberance of the Lord’s unmotivated grace.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord’s patience has also its limit. How long can He hide Himself from His lovers? He remains always everywhere and close to all and remains in search the opportunity to appear. When He finds His appearance uavoidable, He appears the very moment. He was already with Padmanabh before hand; He was feeling charmed to see his penance, keen eagerness and prayer. When his period was over, He appeared before the Brahman Padmanabh. The whole place came to glitter with the divine radiance of the body, Padmnabh’s eye-lids could not check that illumination; his eyes suddenly opened. The divine light like several thousands of suns and inside it was the Lord of four arms with conch, discus, mace, and lotus in His hands, his heart cooled. The eyes without winking began to drink the juice of His charming appearance. Padmanabh with open heart began to sink and rise in the waves of love raining down from the Lord’s graceful eyes, His ambition of birth after birth was accomplished. Nothing came out of his mouth. Suddenly the Lord showered the rain of such a compassion that he was stunned. The Lord was only smiling.</p>
<p class="Text">Remaining still for a while Padmnabh made prayer in choking voice—‘Lord! You are only the Lord of my entire universe and the Lord of the Lords of universe also, the entire prosperity and sweetness depend on You. You are the purifier of the fallen downs, simply Your memory destroys all the sins. You are indwellers of all, inside the universe and beyond the universe it is You only omnipresent. Despite being beyond the universe, the Lord of the whole universe and in the form of the whole universe, You usually appear before the devotees by the blessing of Your grace on them. Even the gods like Brahma etc., don’t know your secret, they salute your feet being humble with the devotional sentiment. Who is spared from the attraction of your handsomeness, tenderness, subservence of love? You remain sleeping in the ocean of milk, yet You remain always present everywhere in the form of ‘Chakradhari,’ to remove the misery of your devotees, the devotees are your own and You are the own of the devotees. You provided Your abode of Supreme Bliss to protect him from all the miseries whosoever bowed his head to Your feet. You are accessible to the Yogis through trance, conscious soul to the followers of Vedant and the entire to the devotees. I am yours, dedicated to your feet—bowed down. Having said  this Padmanabh became silent and what was more to say?</p>
<p class="Text">Now, it was the turn of the Lord. He was quite aware of it that Padmanabh was His selfless devotee, there was no question of sensuous enjoyments of the world in his consciousness, he was free from the desire of salvation even. So, He did not ask Padmanabh to demand any boon. To know the condition of his consciousness watering him with the nectar of His speech the Lord said—‘O the most fortunate foremost Brahmana! I am well acquainted with the fact that you have a single desire in your heart to serve Me. You take it your pleasure in My service and worship having abandoned the gain of this world and the next world, salvation and My abode and want to do the same. May your desire be fulfilled! Make your dwelling place here remaining in My service till the end of Kalpa, at last, you have to come to Me at any cost. Having uttered so, the Lord disappeared and Padmanabha began to pass his best life happily in the Lord’s service physically and mentally. What is better duty than the Lord’s service and worship for which the loving devotees of the Lord should sustain this life? Padmanabh’s every action, every sentiment was dedicated to the Lord and by nature the public welfare was done by him. In spite of leading a secluded life and remaining in the Lord’s service such devotees can do as much well being of the world by their pure resolve so much service cannot be rendered by those who are even highly dutiful remaining engaged in the service of others.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, in the worship and service of the Lord, a number of years of Padmanabh’s life passed—One day, remembering the Lord, he was collecting the ingredients of worship. At the same time a fierce monster attacked him. He had no attachment with his body at all. He was free from the suspicion of his mind of going to any miserable place also. But the monster would engulf him, this imagination certainly created question in his mind that whether the opportunity of the Lord’s service granted by Him would be withdrawn that very moment that day? Will it be the end of my fortune in this way? The Lord has granted me the boon of His service for one epoch, will it prove false? It is a matter of great sorrow. With this thought in his mind, he began to pray to the Lord—‘O the ocean of mercy! O the ultimate shelter of the humbles! O the omniscient! O Chakrapani! Protect me. You protected him whosoever came to Your shelter. I am seeking shelter to You, I am your own; will this demon engulf me before Your eye-sight and Your boon will be untrue? When the crocodile had caught hold of the leader of the herd of the elephants, when the witch of Durvasa wanted to engulf Ambarish, You protected them by using Your ‘discus’. For the protection of Prahlad, You, Yourself had come. This demon has become so audacious that he wants to gulp down your boon even. Lord! keep your vow, protect me from this demon.’</p>
<p class="Text">There may be delay in penetrating the delicate petal of lotus with a shape needle but no delay is possible in the reach of the true call to the Lord. The omniscient Lord had come to know the devotee Padmanabh’s prayer before hand that misery had befallen on him. The Lord is already omniscient and does everything what is right; but the people fail to have faith in His dispensation that is why they think pros and cons. The Lord sent His favourite weapon ‘Sudarshanachakra’ for the protection of the devotee Padmanabh. The lustre of the ‘Chakra’ (wheel) is equal to that of crores of suns. The fierce flames of fire generally blaze out of it to burn the devotees fear to ashes. To see the lustrous form of the ‘Chakra’ the demon got frightened and ran away very fast leaving the Brahmana there, but why was the ‘Sudarshanachakra’ to spare him? He had to emancipate that demon also.</p>
<p class="Text">Sixteen years earlier since today this demon was a demi-god. His name was Sunder. One day he was enjoying and merry making in the water of Kaveri river in Rangakshetra with his wives. At the same time, the foremost sage Vasishtha the great devotee of Shri Ranganatha passed from that side, the women felt shy to see him. Coming out of the water in haste they put on their garments. But mad in intoxication Sunder remained stood as it is with the unrestrained feelings. The foremost sage rebuked him to see his perverse attitude and said—‘O the mean demi-god! You are displaying such a mean action in this pious river of this sacred area. You don’t deserve to be a demi-god; go and be a demon.’ Just on the curse of Vasishth, his wives caught the foremost sages feet, running there. They prayed to him—‘O the foremost sage! You are expert in religious principles, very powerful and kind-hearted. Keeping us in your mind don’t express your wrath on our husband. The husband is the ornament of women, it is only the husband, the life of the chaste women. Despite being the mother of one hundred sons, the woman will be called a widow without husband. The woman’s life is empty without husband. O the ocean of mercy! Be pleased with us. For the dignity of the women like us be graceful to our lord. Forgive him for his fault looking towards us by virtue of your mercy. He is your servant, he is in wait of your command.’ The foremost sage Vasishth was pleased. He said—‘Goddesses! Your husband-devotedness is an ideal; my words never prove false, I never tell a lie knowingly, so the words uttered even unknowingly prove to be true. So, Sunder will have to be transformed to demon; but on the sixteenth year since today, when he attacks on Padmanabh, the ‘Sudarshanachakra’ will emancipate him.’</p>
<p class="Text">Today was the last day of sixteenth year. The demon was running away very fast, but where could he escape himself from the ‘Sudarshanachakra’? Just in the twinkling of an eye the ‘Sudarshanachakra’ cut down his head and the very moment the demon turned to demi-god. Endowed with divine body, divine garments and divine ornaments Sundar saluting the ‘Sudarshanachakra’ made prayer—‘O the most favourit weapon of the Lord! I salute you again and again.  Your lustre is more than crores of suns. You annihilate the enemies of devotees. You are graceful to me to set me free from the demonic class of birth. I am, now, departing for my world in the form of demigod. Remain graceful to me always. Grant me such a boon that I may not forget you ever and remain remembering you forever. Wherever I live, my mind should remain concentrated to you.’ Saying—‘Be it so!’ the Sudarsanachakra’ fulfilled his ambition. He made the journey of his world by a divine chariot.</p>
<p class="Text">The devotee Padmanabh made the prayer of the ‘Sudarshanachakra’ after the departure of Sundar to his world of demigods—‘O Sudarshan! I salute you again and again. The vow of your life is to protect the world. That is why the Lord has made you the ornament of His hands. You have saved the numberless devotees from time to time from their great miseries, I am indebted to your grace. You are omnipotent, this is my only prayer to you to stay long here and protect the world. The ‘Sudarshanachakra’ granted the prayer of the devotee, Padmanabh and said—‘O the foremost devotee! Your prayer can never go futile because, You are the great favoured one of the Lord. It is here where I will always stay just near you. Serve and worship the Lord fearlessly. Now, no obstacle can be created in your adoration. Having granted the boon to Padmnabh in this way, the ‘Sudarshanachakra’ entered the ‘Pushkarni’ just infront. That is why it was named ‘Chakratirth’.</p>
<p class="Text">Having the direct experience of Lord’s grace, Padmanabh heart was filled with love and joy. Serving the Lord more devotedly with concentrated mind, he began to pass his life. The life of such loving devotees is really blessed because they live in ecstacy at every moment and at every step experiencing the grace of the eternal Lord.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">The Devotee-Kirat and Nandi Vaishya</p>
<p class="Text">Ashutosh Lord Shankar is famous by the name of ‘Audharadani’ (bountiful donor). His idol is the symbol of renunciation, peace, knowledge, grace and power. In spite of being the Supreme Lord His abode is on the funeral ground, despite being white like camphor his whole body is pasted with ashes, despite being ‘Ardhanarishwar’ He is ‘Urdhvareta’, the lord of riches, Kuber remains waiting for His command, yet He is ‘Kritivasa’, in spite of being above selfishness and the universal good, He remains absorbed in the practice of penance for the ideal of the universe. If Lord Vishnu is the embodied bliss, Shankar is the embodied knowledge. Shankar is the heart of Vishnu and Vishnu is of Shankar. So the both are the forms of each other, so the both are one and solidified knowledge and bliss (Gyananandaghan). If either of the both is worshipped, the fruit is the same. Actually their adoration is the fruit of life. As there are number of devotees of Vishnu so are of the devotees of Shiv. As the Lord Shankar is divine so are His devotees and their devotion. When why and with whom He is pleased—it cannot be said. There are so many fables prevalent concerning to this. Here, the narrative of the Lord Shiva’s devotee Kirat and Nandi Vaishya are being mentioned.</p>
<p class="Text">In the ancient time a Vaishya named Nandi was a very rich and well-reputed person of the city Avanti. He was of a great moral conduct. He was highly devoted to the moral duty according to his class of birth and stage of life. He had already taken a vow to worship Lord Shiva daily. He got up early in the morning daily, went to the temple with Brahman well versed of worship-rules and methods and worshipped Lord Shankar to the best of his capacity. Having bathed with the sacred mixture of milk, sugar, curd, ghee and honey he offered the fragrant flowers of different  colours and donated gem, pearl and diamonds in gift. He got prepared different items of food daily and offered food to the deity with great zeal. His daily routine continued for several years.</p>
<p class="Text">Although Lord Shankar is pleased even with the worship—He was pleased with the king Indrasen who used to say to his soldiers <span class="char-style-override-3">आहार-प्रहर</span> (Ahara and Prahara) only by his pronunciation of ‘Hara-Hara’—yet He does not want his devotees to remain with any lapse: He sometimes makes delay also in being pleased. Even His delay also is full of His excessive grace. He caused such an occurence here that indicates that the Lord is not pleased by obeying the rules only, there is something more necessary for Him and that is the devotion with emotion, love and self-sacrifice.</p>
<p class="Text">The temple in which Nandi Vaishya used to worship was situated in the forest at some distance from the populated area. This is the occurence of a day when a hunter (Kirat) passed from there while hunting. He took much interest and pleasure in the violence of the living beings which is completely censured. His mind was dull, there was not the least trace of wisdom in him. It was the time of midday, he was getting restless with hunger and thirst. Coming near the temple he took bath in the pond there and by drinking water he quenched his thirst. When he began to return form there; his sight fell on the temple and it is not known what were the impressions of his previous birth that flashed in his consciousness and the desire was created in his mind to view the Lord’s image to go insidse the temple. When going inside the temple he glanced the Lord’s image, He intended to worship and he worshipped according to his mind.</p>
<p class="Text">It can be easily presumed what worship he would have performed. He had neither any object of worship nor he knew about it. He did not feel it even necessary to know the method of the use of the particular object. He marked that the others had offered the leaves and fruits of the wood apple tree after bathing. He broke the leaves and fruits of the wood apple tree with one  hand and the meat was already there in his next hand. Bathing with the palmful water for cleaning mouth he offered the leaves and fruits of the wood apple tree and the meat. He was of the non-vegetarian scheduled tribe, he was ignorant of the fact that the meat should not be offered to the gods. If the same is done by anyone knowingly, he becomes guilty of sin but he had worshipped with the sentiment of innerself according to his knowledge and competence. He felt great pleasure; he prostrated his whole body before the Shiva’s stone phallus being charmed with emotion. He determined firmly to worship the Lord Shankar daily since that day. His resolve was unshaking; because this was the inspiration of his deep innerself.</p>
<p class="Text">The next day in the morning Nandi Vaishya came to worship. He was stunned to see the condition of the temple. The worship-ingredients of the previous day were scattered to and fro. He thought—‘What happened? Certainly there must have been any mistake in my worship that has resulted so. Such an occurence to desecrate the temple never happened. This is my misfortune. Absorbed in such thoughts he cleaned the temple and then, after taking bath he worshipped the Lord. After coming back home he narrated the whole story to his priest and expressed the grave concern. What was known to the priest that someone’s devotional sentiment might be there probably! He reacted—‘It is dead sure that this is the work of any fool, otherwise why would anyone desecrate the temple by scattering the gems in this way? All right! I will also accompany you tomorrow and see who is that wicked behind it? Nandi Vaishya passed that night in great agony.</p>
<p class="Text">Early in the morning Nandi Vaishya along with his priest reached the temple of the Lord Shiv. They found the same desecrated condition of the temple that day also as it was the previous day. After cleansing there Nandi worshipped the deity with five objects (perfume, flowers, incense, candle and sweets) and performed ‘Rudrabhisheka’ (consecration of Rudra or Shiv). The Brahmans began to recite the hymns. By the sound of the Vedas-chantings the entire forest came to resound, all were curious to know and watchful to see when and from which side that wicked to desecrate of the temple came. In the mid of the day Kirat came. His appearance was very dreadful. There were bow and arrow in his hands. Such was the sportive display of the Lord Shankar that all were frightened to see kirat and hid themselve in a corner. In no time before their eyes Kirat devastated the objects of worship offered by them and bathing with the palmful water used for cleansing mouth, Kirat offered the fruit and leaves of the wood apple tree and meat. When he went away after having prostration posture, Nandi Vaishya and the Brahman then, got comforted and all came back to the populated area. On the query of Nandi the Brahmans gave their judgement that it was to create hindrance in the worship. Even the foremost gods cannot give its solution. So, let us bring the idol of the stone phallus to our residence here. When could this sense prevail in the minds of those learned ones that Kirat was a greater devotee of the Lord than Nandi Vaishya and he was also offering his worship to the Lord as per his knowledge. On the unanimous decision of the Brahmanas the Shiv’s stone phallus was brought from there and its installation was made in the prescribed way at the house of Nandi Vaishya. There is no scarcity of gold and gems at his house at all, without the least hesitation they were used; but the Lord needs something more in addition to riches and property.</p>
<p class="Text">According to his daily routine Kirat came there at the fixed time to worship the Lord Shankar; but he began to think not to get the idol there—‘What is this, the Lord is not here today.’ He searched out each and every corner of the temple, he minutely marked each and every hole, he tried to search out around the temple also to the best of his capacity; but this all proved in vain! He could not get his Lord. In the mind of Kirat it was not an idol but the Lord, Himself. His Lord’s worship was not for the sake of his life but he had already sacrificed his life for the Lord. He became overwhelmed not to get the Lord; the entire of his life had begun to call piteously from the core and corner of his heart—‘Mahadeva! Shambhu! Where did you run away to leave me? Lord! Even the delay of a single moment is not tolerable to me. My soul is writhing; my chest is bursting, nothing is visible to my eyes. Listen to my pathetic call, save my life. Satisfy my eyes with Your view. Jagannatha! Tripurantak! What will I do to remain alive without seeing your sight? I tell you solemnly  and I tell you truly that I cannot survive without you. Don’t You see my condition in Your absence Ashutosh! ‘This cruelty does not become you. Have you gone in deep meditation? Are you asleep somewhere? Does my pathetic call not reach your ears? While praying so it started the spontaneous overflow of tears from the eyes of kirat; he became restless, he began to knock down his hands and beat his body. He said—‘There is no fault from my side knowingly then what is the reason you went away? Well, all right? I will worship you at all cost. Having cut the sufficient flesh of his body with his own hands Kirat put it at that place where there had been the Shiva’s stone phallus previously. With sound heart because now, he had already made up his mind to sacrifice his life, having taken bath in the pond he sat down as usual to worship having saluted in prostration and sat to meditate.</p>
<p class="Text">Generally, people meditate but they meditate to concentrate considering it their duty for sometime. That is why they fail to anchor their mind in mditation because they remain keeping several latent desires safe for the time after their meditation. Kirat’s consciousness was now, free from any sensuous desire. He wanted only the apparent view of the Lord. Meditation or death was his discipline. That is why without any distraction he reached his goal and his consciousness began to wander about in the world of the Lord’s frolicsome activities. His innersight began to drink the juice of the nectar of the supernatural beauty of the Lord’s body limbs embellished with the snakes matted and braided hair with the waves of the Ganga emerging from them, his white body like camphor and embellished with ashes and joining His sportive display he began to serve Him in different ways. He was completely unmindful of the outer world, his body or his ownself; he was feeling intoxicated with the nectar of the aroma of his inner world; he was carefree. outwardly his body looked horripilated, tears were falling down from his eyes, there was emerging the waves of immense joy from his hair root, where was lying asleep such an emotion of sweetness in that cruel evil doing kirat, who can know it?</p>
<p class="Text">To see this concentration Shivaji broke out His trance. Not in his inner world; but before these eyes of the body—with which we see the world—He appeared. The moon abiding on his forehead made the body of Kirat white with its nectarean rays. Each and every particle of his body changed into nectar. But his meditation was as it was. Purging his mistake of non-existence as if the Lord Shiva said to Kirat—‘O the great wise! O the brave!! I am indebted to the sentiment of your devotion and love, tell me your heartiest ambition; I can do anything for you.’ The Lord’s speech and resolve compelled Kirat to see outward. But when he knew that what he was perceiving in his innerself, the same was outward also, then his devotional love reached its climax and saluting while prostrating, he lay down in the Lord’s feet. When the  Lord lifted him up with great love and on His inspiration he prayed—‘Lord! I am Your slave, You are my master—my this attitude may continue forever and in any class of birth after rebirth whenever I am born and how many times I am born I may remain engaged in Your service. Every moment Your love may remain growing more and more in my heart. Lord! It is You my kind mother and just father. My helping brother and the dearest friend You are! It is you only my deity and my spell also. There is nothing except you in the three worlds and the three worlds are also nothing, it is only you who are everything everywhere. To hear Kirat’s unselfish and loveful prayer of love the Lord was pleased very much and He made him his courtier forever. To get him as His courtier the Lord Shankar was overjoyed and he began to play on His tabor to express out His exhilaration.</p>
<p class="Text">With the tabor of the Lord kettledrum, conch, the kettle like drum and tympana began to resound in all the three words. The sky was resounded with the sound of applaud all around. The consciousness of the devotees of Shiva was flooded with immense joy. This rejoice and uproar reached Nandi Vaishya’s house. He was very much surprised and he atonce reached there. His heart was thrilled with joy to see Kirat’s emotion of devotion and the Lord’s mercy. Whatever the impurity of ignorance was there in his consciousness that—‘The Lord can be attained with riches etc., was washed away.’ Being bewitched he began to recite the praise of Kirat—‘O the austere! You are a great devotee of the Lord; it is your devotion that has compelled the Lord to be pleased and appear here. I am in your shelter. It is now your job to offer me in the Lord’s feet.’ The words of Nandi pleased Kirat very much. The very moment holding the hands of Nandi, he presented him in the Lord’s feet. At that time ‘Bhole Baba’ became really ignoramous. He asked Kirat—‘Who is this gentleman? What was the need to include him among My attendants?’ Kirat said—‘Lord! He is your servant, he worshipped you daily with gems and diamonds. Recognise him and adopt him. Smiling Shankar said— I recollect him much less. You are my lover, friend; but who is he? Just mind brother! He is dear to Me who is unselfish, guileless and who remembers Me wholeheartedly; I recognise him only.’ Kirat made prayer—‘Lord! I am Your devotee and he is my lover. You adopted me and I adopted him, both of us are your attendants.’ Now, Shankar had no escape to say anything. The acceptance of the devotee is more recommending than that of Lord. Just, the words coming out of Kirat’s mouth spread in the whole world. The people began to praise highly that Kirat emacipated Nandi Vaishya.</p>
<p class="Text">At the very moment several illuminating divine chariots landed, there from the space. Achieving the form of Shankar both of the devotees accompanied Him to Kailash and being welcomed by the mother Parvati began to live there. The same two devotees became famous by the name of Nandi and Mahakal among the attandants of the Lord Shankar. Thus, Ashutosh Lord Shankar donated His form to the both by creating stimulation of devotion to Kirat through the devotion of Nandi and giving perfection to the devotion of Nandi through the devotion of Kirat and fulfilled them.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">The devotee-king Punyanidhi</p>
<p class="Text">The kingdom of Pandya and the Chole family race in South are very famous since ancient time. Both the races have produced the well renowned moral, just and the Lord devotee kings. Their distinctive characteristics of nurturing the public is heard and described with great love even today. They regarded the subjects dearer than their own sons and the subject also regarded them God in  the form of mankind. All were happy; peace prevailed everywhere. The days that are being mentioned here are the days when the capital of Pandya dynasty was Madura—Which is popular by the name of Madura, nowadays. The king, Punyanidhi was the absolute king of the kingdom. Punyanidhi’s name was meaningful. In reality, he was the treasure of virtues and noble deeds. His simple life was so high and ideal that anyone who saw him could not remain without being impressed by him. His life was full of peace, peace was therein his family as well as in his kingdom. By the influence of his virtues and  and guileless dealings the entire subject was becoming virtuous. The administration had proved needless, everyone discharged one’s duty with great love. His armforce was only for the protection of the subjects. His entire activities depended on love and self-confidence. From time to time, he made the journey of the holy places of pilgrimage, performed ‘Yagya’, donated in charity and helped the poors and destitutes liberally. The most noteworthy quality of his character was that whatever he did, he did it for the sake of the Lord, he did it for the Lord’s pleasure and love. His consciousness was free from any longing of this world the next world. He discharged his duty guilelessly, considering it the Lord’s command and for for His pleasure by virtue of His strength.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, with his family members and his army, Punyanidhi set out on the journey of Setubandh Rameshwara. This time, he had a longing to stay for more days on the holy coast of the sea, in the superior land of Gandhmadan mountain; so, he had handed over the entire responsibility of the royal affairs to his son and he began to live there with the necessary objects and attendants.</p>
<p class="Text">Basically, Madura itself is a holy place of pilgrimage. Due to being the area of activity of the goddess Minakshi and the Lord Somsundar its sportive glory cannot be minimised. But Rameshwar is verily Rameshwar. The Lord Rama has established Lord Shiv’s stone phallus here. All the holy places of pilgrimage being manifested are situated here. The ocean, the forest here all are charming, land of penances and infusing purity. The king Punyanidhi’s mind got concentrated there. He stayed there for a long time. There was the Lord’s devotion in his heart. Wherever he went, wherever he lived he used to remember and contemplate on God. He had no desire at all in his mind, that is why his innerself was pure. Whatever the resolve comes in the pure innerself, remains confined to the Lord’s pleasure and with that resolve whatever the action was performed is also for the cause of the Lord. The king had no discrimination between Vishnu and Shiva. Sometimes, he used to be intoxicated while worshipping the Lord Shankar and sometimes he investigated the frolicsome activities of the Lord Rama wandering about in the forest. Once, an idea came to his mind to attain the Lord’s pleasure by performing ‘Yagya’. The ‘Yagya’ was performed with great preperation. On the end of the function of the Yagya, the king went to Dhanushkoti, the place of pilgrimage for the ‘Avabhrith-bath’. At the distance of twelve to thirteen miles from Rameshwar the holy pilgrimage ‘Dhanushkoti’ is situated. The sea is of the bow-shape there. It is said that when the Lord Rama was coming back after the victory over Lanka, He had donated the bow here or He had taken off the bow-string. The king got a great joy to take bath at that holy place. Whatever the work is done with the memory of the Lord that is very joyful.</p>
<p class="Text">When the king Punyanidhi began to come back from there after bath, charity, daily routine work and the Lord’s worship, a very pretty maiden happened to meet him on the way. She was not a mere girl but she seemed to be the idol of beauty. There was purity in her eyes, the glow of cheerfulness on her face and her entire body was full of a wonderful delicacy. As if it were the manifested form of Lord’s cheerfulness. In reality it was the cheerfulness of the Lord. In spite of being unknown, the king was attracted  to her as if she were his own daughter. He asked in the affectionate words—‘Daughter! Who are you? Who is your father, why have you come here?’ The girl said—‘My mother-father are not alive, I have no brother and relative also, I am an orphan. I have come to become your daughter. I will dwell in your palace; I will be looking you but there is a condition that if anybody touches me forcibly or catches hold of my hand, you will have to punish him. If you do so, I will remain staying with you for a long time.’</p>
<p class="Text">The king Punyanidhi was unware of the fact that it was the fruit of his endless noble deeds which has appeared in the manifested form. He was quite ignorant of it that it was the goddess Lakshmi, Herself, the better half  of the Lord, who has come to my house after love-quarrel with Him by His will to show Her grace to me. It was beyond his presumption also that she had appeared before him to test his righteousness, truthfulness, adherence to his pledge and by brightenning his life more to place him as an ideal before the world and to make the Lord appear before him.’ The dear devotees of the Lord are usually very kind, remain eager to serve the shelterless; because he who has none his own, belongs to the Lord. He who serves him, serves the own man of the Lord. How could the king ignore this orphan girl? In his view, she was not only an orphan girl, but unconsciously, somewhere in the corner of his mind it was that she was by any way related to his deity certainly. Probably, it was His sportive display. The king said—‘Daughter! I assure you to do whatever you say. I have no other girl at my house, there is only my son, You should live in the harem with my wife as a daughter. When you are grown up to the age of marriage, I will do according to your will.’ The girl agreed to the king’s words and she came to the capital timely. The king Punyanidhi’s wife Vindhyawati was also of pure heart like her husband. She used to worship her husband considering him the idol of Lord. She did her best for his pleasure. Her will was the will of her husband, her life was the life of the king. She was very much pleased to get this girl. The king said—‘She is our daughter, she should never be treated as other one.’ Vindhyawati caught hold of the girl’s hand with love and began to bring up her as son. Thus, some days passed.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord’s sportive display is very strange. How on which pretext whom the Lord blesses is not known to any one except Him. This exploit had been displayed only to bless Punyanidhi with His grace. Now, the right time reached. One day, that girl was plucking flowers in the royal garden with her female friends. All the girls were of about the same age, they were amusing themselves by merrymaking together. At the same time, a Brahman came there. There was pitcher on his shoulders which was full of water. With one hand, he had the hold of the pitcher and he was holding an umbrella in the other hand, as if he were returning just now after taking bath in the Ganga. His body was pasted with ashes. There were three horizontal marks made on his forehead. There was the garland of Rudraksha in his hand and Lord Shankar’s name in his mouth. That girl was stunned to see this Brahman, she recognised who he was in the garb of the Brahman. That disguised Brahman was searching for this girl. The Brahman recognised the girl just as he glanced at her and reaching there he caught the girls’ hand. The girl shricked, Her girl friends also followed her. Just hearing her shriek the king Punyanidhi with many soldiers reached there and asked—‘Daughter! Why did you cry? Who has insulted you? There were tears in the girl’s eyes. She was feeling restless with sorrow and anger. She said—‘Pandyanath! This Brahman has forcibly caught my hand and still he is standing beneath the tree fearlessly.’ The king, Punyanidhi came to remember his promise. He began to think that he had given words to this girl that if anybody caught her hand forcibly against her will he would punish him. ‘I have adopted this girl as my daughter, I must punish this Brahman.’ He could not have even the imagination in his mind that the Lord would have come to shower His grace on him. He ordered his soldiers and the Brahman was arrested. Having hand-cuffed and binding his feet in shackles he was put in the Ramanath’s temple. Being pleased, the girl went away to the harem and the king went to his court.</p>
<p class="Text">The night set in. The king saw in the dream that the Brahman whom he had arrested was apparently God. He is dark like the cloud of rainy season, His all the four hands are embellished with conch, discus, mace and lotus, His body is wrapped in yellow garment. His bosom is embellished with Kaustubhamani and wearing the garland of flowers; smiling mildly, in the mouth the rays of his teeth are brightenning all the directions. His ear-ring shaped like crocodile are spreading a unique radiance. He is present on the back of ‘Garuda’ on the bedstead of ‘Sheshanag’ Along with Him the king’s daughter is sitting on the flourished lotus. His hair are curly and black, there is lotus in the hand, the most powerful and majestic persons are consecrating. He is wearing the garland of invaluable gems and diamonds. The attendants like Vishwaksen the seers like Narada etc., are engaged in His service. To see that Brahman in the form of Mahavishnu and his daughter in the form of Mahalakshmi the king Punyanidhi was amazed-stunned. Just after the breaking of the dream he went  to his daughter. But what is this? The daughter is not in the form of his daughter, her that form is present before his eyes what he had seen in the dream. Having saluted the Mahalakshmi by prostrating he went with her to the Ramanath’s temple. There he saw the Brahman also in the same form what he had seen in the dream. Remembering his crime he lost his sense like fainted. ‘I arrested the Lord of the three worlds. I put Him in shackles whom I should worship. Curse to me! Hundred times curse to me! Whom the formost Yogis sacrifise their entire having seated Him on the throne of their hearts, to consider whom their own, they feel satisfied; I handcuffed the same Lord! Who can be the greater criminal than I! The king Punyanidhi’s heart began to burst, his body became weak there was not the delay of even half of a moment in his death. In the meantime the Lord’s grace came to his memory. Such a wonderful sportive display! Well! Who has power to arrest Him? Yashoda had tied Him with love and I tied Him in arrogance of my power, wrath. But he got arrested even by me. Lord! if it is not Your  grace then what is else? </p>
<p class="Text">The king made prayer with his heart of emotion choking throat tears in his eyes, with horripilated  body bowing his head with folded hands—‘Lord! I salute Your feet myriad of time. Be graceful to me, be pleased; I have committed this crime unknowingly. But the crime done knowingly or unknowingly whatever the reason may be is but a crime. O the lotus-eyed! O Kamalakant! You destroyed Ravan by incarnating in the form of Rama, saved Prahlad by incarnating in the form of man-lion (Nrisinghavatara). In spite of being All-pervading, you usually appear in the manifested form from time to time for the devotees. Your image is graceful; how can the worldly people recognise You, if you don’t appear in the manifested form? O the embodiment of mercy? I have committed a great crime and injustice to arrest you and put you in shackles. If you don’t oblige me there is no means for my redemption. I salute Your feet again and again.</p>
<p class="Text">The king Punyanidhi said casting his look towards Mahalakshmiji—‘O Goddess! O the Universal Mother! I salute you again and again. Your dwelling place is the bosom of the Lord. I have harassed considering you a common girl. Who is there to describe Your glory? It is you to appear in the form of Siddhi, Sandhya, Prabha, Shraddha, Atmavidya  and spiritual knowledge etc. O Mother! It is you who have appeared in the form of the Vedas for the protection of the world. O Brahmswarupini! Grant me life with Your merciful grace. Thus, after such a prayer the king made prayer to the Lord—‘Lord! Forgive me for my offence done unknowingly, this entire world and all the living beings of this world are Your small children. You are the sole father of all. Madhusudan! it has been the tradition that the elders and preceptors have been forgiving the fault of the small children. Lord! You granted your form to the demons and monsters who had committed crimes after crimes Lord! Forgive me for my this fault. O Lord! When You had incarnated in the form of Krishna, Putana had come to kill you; You placed her in your lotus feet. O the treasure of grace! Lakshmikant! Cast your tender graceful look at me also.’ </p>
<p class="Text">To hear the prayer of Punyanidhi the Lord said—‘O the king! it is not proper for you to fear on account of arresting Me. I am by nature the prisoner of My lovers; under the sway of My devotees. You had performed ‘Yagya’ for My pleasure. Those who do any work for My pleasure are My devotees; The performance of your ‘Yagya’ captured Me under your control. That is why whether you put Me in shackles or not, I am in the shackles of your love. I don’t count the guilts of My devotees as any guilt. So, there is nothing to fear. This Mahalakshmi is My wife and My power. She had come with My consent  to test your devotion. You have satisfied Me to adopt Her despite being an orphan girl in disguise to protect Her and keeping Her in your palace. She is My inseparable part, she is eternal and universal Mother; Her attendant is My attendant. By worshipping Her you have made My worship. You have not committed any crime but pleased me. To arrest Me and put Me in shackles for the fulfilment of the promise you had made to Her is not any guilt and improper by anyway. You have protected Her, so I am pleased with you. How pleasant it is for Me to be arrested by the hands of My dearest devotee for the sake of My beloved, it is known to Me only. This Lakshmi is your daughter, take it so. It is true without the least doubt.’</p>
<p class="Text">Mahalakshmi said—‘O the king! You have given Me protection for a long time, so I am extremely pleased with you. The Lord and I, Myself; made the pretext of  love-quarrel to purify your devotion and thus, both of us appeared before you. You didn’t commit any crime. We are pleased with you. By Our grace you will always remain happy. May you be the owner of the entire prosperity of the earth! May your unswerving devotion to our feet remain continuing till you are alive! May your mind not divert towards the sinful acts but remain concentrated in righteousness, May your heart remain absorbed in the joy of Devotion always! After the end of this life merge with us. Having uttered so, Mahalakshmi merged into the bosom of the Lord. The Lord said—‘O the king! As you have tied Me it is a very sweet tie. I don’t want to be released from it and its memory should not vanish here. So, I will dwell here in the form as it is and My name will be ‘Setumadhava’. Having said so the Lord became silent.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-3">The king Punyanidhi worshipped this image of adoration and after the service of Ramanath—Shiva’s stone phallus he went to his house. Throughout the life he along with his wife remained engaged in the rememberance and contemplation of the Lord. At last the both having got complete union, merged in the Lord and achieved oneness with the Lord. Thus, the Lord owned His devotees by acting the wonderful sportive display of love and by accepting the tie got from His devotee for ever, he evidenced clearly his subservience to His love and grace.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">The Shiv Devotee-Mahakal</p>
<p class="Text">A great glorious Brahman named Manti lived there in the city Varanasi in the ancient time. He was a great devotee of Lord Shiva and used to mutter the ‘Shiva-spell’ always. As fated he was issueless. So, he performed the muttering of the spell of ‘Shiv-mantra' continuously for one hundred years to get a son. On the completion of one hundred years one day, the Lord Shankar appeared before him being pleased with his penance and said—‘Son Manti! I am pleased with your adoration. Your ambition will be fulfilled very soon and you will get a very vigorous, influencial and intelligent son like Me and he will emancipate your entire dynesty.’ Having uttered so Shivji disappeared and Manti was overjoyed to get the sight of the charming appearance of the Lord Shankar even unobtainable to the Yogis and to get the desired boon. </p>
<p class="Text">The name of Manti’s wife was Chatika. She was  highly chaste and as if personified penance. In the due course of time the lady ascetic Brahmini became pregnant.  The womb grew and side by side the splendour of the chaste lady Brahmin flourished; but four years passed and the issue did not come out of the womb. All were astonished to see this event. Manti thought that certainly it was some supernatural child who did not want to come out of the womb. So going to his wife addressing the child in the womb, he began to say—‘Son! Even the common sons are to give more pleasure to their parents, but you have come to the womb of a very chaste mother of moral conduct and you are the fruit of my long hard penance by the grace of the Lord Shankar. In such a condition is it proper for you that you are causing so much trouble to your mother in this way and proving the cause of my worry too? O son! This human life itself is conducive to attainment of ‘Dharm, Arth, Kam, Moksh’. In the Shastras it has been mentioned rarely obtainable to even gods. Then, why are you so much afraid in coming to this world? The creatures of other classes of birth remain pining for the human life and pray to the creator constantly for their birth in the human life in which different kinds of religions are practised and by the worship of the gods and the ancestors great fruit is achieved. Having even got this unparralleled human life for which even the gods crave, showing indifference towards it what is the reason you are not coming out of your mother’s womb? There in the womb you cannot be able to move even easily and would be feeling great torture; then why don’t you delight all to come out of the womb quickly?’</p>
<p class="Text">The womb said—‘O father! Whatever you have said is well known to me. I am quite aware of this fact also that human birth is very rare; I am very much frightened with the chronotogical way (Kalamarga). In the Vedas there is the description of two ways—‘Kala’ and ‘Archi’. By the way of ‘Kala Marga’ the living soul is entangled in the net of actions and by the means of worship (Archi Marg) the salvation is attained. The living being going on the ‘Kal Marg’ does not get comfort even in the heaven even if he attains it by the influence of his meritofious deeds. So, the wise man always remains attentive that he may not go astray on the deep terrible ‘Kalamarg’. So, if you may find out any way that my mind nay not indulge with the worldly vices, I can take my birth in this human world.’</p>
<p class="Text">To hear the condition of the child in the womb Manti became more frightened. He thought—‘Who was there to fulfil this condition except Lord Shankar? With His grace he who has fulfilled my ambition, will fulfil this condition also.’ Thinking so, he went to the shelter of Lord Shankar mentally and began to make prayer to Him—‘Maheshwar! Who can fulfil the prayer of my son except You? It is You to bless me with son by Your grace and now it is You only to oblige me with your grace to cause him to be born on the earth.’ The Lord Ashutosh heard the prayer of Manti. Having called religion, knowledge, dispassion and prosperity etc., in the manifested form, He said—‘Just see, Manti’s would be son has got the reverse knowledge, so all of you should go and persuade him to follow the right path.’ After the command of Maheshwar, all the majesties assuming the manifested form went near the child in the womb and began to say addressing him—‘O the wise son of Manti! Don’t entertain any fear in your mind. By the grace of the Lord Shankar, we the righteousness, knowledge, dispassion and prosperity will never abandon your mind. So, being fearless come out of the womb.’ Having uttered so the four divine personages became silent. When they became silent immorality, ignorance attachment and poverty also having assumed the dreadful idol form reached there by the command of Lord Shankar and began to say to the son of Manti—‘If you are not moving out due to our fear, then be free from this fear. By the command of the Lord Shankar, we will not enter inside you at all.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, just hearing the words of assurance of righteousness, knowledge, dispassion and prosperity and its opponents immorality, ignorance, attachment and poverty, the child Manti’s son came out of pregnancy without any delay and began to weep trembling. Then, the majesties of Lord Shankar said to Manti—‘Mark Manti! Your son is still trembling and weeping with the fear of ‘Kalamarga’. So, your this son will be famous by the name of Kalabhiti.’ Saying so thus, the majesties went away to their master Shankarji.</p>
<p class="Text">The child Kalabhiti began to grow up slowly and slowly like the moon of the moonlit fortnight. The father performed his rituals as sacred thread ceremony etc., and initiated him the <span class="char-style-override-4">‘Shiva-Panchakshara Mantra’</span> making him steadfast in ‘Pashupatavrat’. Kalabhiti like his father became completely devoted to <span class="char-style-override-4">‘Panchaksharamantra’</span>. He travelled different areas of Lord Shiva as regards his journey to the pilgrimages and moving about he reached the area namely ‘Stambhatirth’ which influence he had already heard through the mouths of others. There he took bath in the river named Mahi and muttered a lot standing in the river water. While returning from there to see a wood apple tree in the vicinity, he sat under its shadow and muttered one lacs of muttering more. Just sitting under the wood apple tree, he felt the supernatural peace there. While muttering there, his sense organs being introvert in natural way got merged. At that time, he began to realize himself only the embodied Supreme bliss. That joy was so exceptional that even the immense joy of heaven was nothing before it. As the water of the Ganga is unique of its kind, similarly that joy also could not be compared to any other object.</p>
<p class="Text">After a period of time when Kalabhiti again recovered  his natural state, being amazed he began to say to himself—‘Oh! The unique happiness what I got at this place was never experienced by me anywhere at any place previously. At present, my consciousness has become entirely immutable and my sense organs have become untainted like the water of the Ganga. I have developed a great love for all the living beings in my heart. This world seems to me very blissful. My mind has also been convinced that the righteousness is the only substance in this world. Oh! What a supernatural impact of this place is! The people truly say that the place, that is as much free from vices, disturbances and is pious is so much suitable for the moral deeds and to get thousand times more fruit. Then, why should I not stay here and practice penance for a long time? I have already wandered about sufficient, it will be more useful to me to worship the deity sitting at a place. Those who are not confined to any certain place and remain wandering about in search of a suitable place throughout their life remaining in a fix which particular place is appropriate and which one not, never get perfect accomplishment and eternal bliss. The journey of their whole life passess on only in agony.’</p>
<p class="Text">So, after well consideration, under wood apple tree he began to mutter the ‘Rudramantra’ with the concentrated mind standing on the only support of the front portion of his feet thumb without food and water. He kept the vow not to drink even a drop of water and no food at all. As soon as one hundred years came to end a stranger came to Kalabhiti with a pitcher full of water and saluting him, he began to say to the ascetic Brahman—‘O the prudent Kalabhiti! Today, your religious performance has completed by the grace of the Lord Shankar. Totally one hundred years have passed bearing hunger and thirst. With a great love having purified myself exclusively I have brought this water for you. Please, accept it and fructify my labour.’</p>
<p class="Text">Kalabhiti was really very thirsty. His soul was writhing for a palm of water. But he didnot think it proper to accept the water brought by a stranger abruptly. Looking towards that stranger with suspicious eyes, he said—‘Who are you? What is your caste and conduct? Please, tell me frankly. Only after knowing your caste and conduct, I can drink this water brought by you.’ Then, the stranger said—‘O ascetic! It is not known to me even whether my parents are in this world or in the next world or not. I know nothing about them, I always live in this very way. I have nothing to do with conduct and righteousness. So, what can I say about conduct? If asked truly, I don’t follow the rules of any conduct.’</p>
<p class="Text">Kalabhiti said—‘If it is so, then; I beg pardon of you. I cannot drink the water given by you. In this regard what my preceptor has given me sermon in consonance with Vedas; I relate to you. The ascetic does not take the meal and water of that man whose clan and purity of blood is not known. In the same way, the meal and water is not worthy to be taken from the hands of those who don’t know the Lord and don’t worship Him. The man who eats without  offering the Lord first is a great sinner. As the water of the Ganga filled up in a pitcher becomes impure by mixing a drop of wine in it, similarly, the food of an atheist becomes impure even if it has been cooked with great purity. But even if a man is the great devotee of the Lord Shiva but his caste and conduct is of a downfall, his food is also not fit to be eaten. In the regard of food and water both the two points have been kept under consideration in the Shastras. The food and water whatever is taken must have been offered to the Lord first and the person who has brought it must be holy by his caste and conduct.</p>
<p class="Text">That man began to laugh to hear these words of Kalabhiti and said—‘O the ascetic! You seem to be a great fool to me even though you are well off with knowledge and penance. I am bound to laugh to hear your these words. O the innocent! Don’t you know that Lord Shiva is present in all the beings alike? In such a condition it is quite improper to say anyone holy or unholy. To reproach anyone by pointing him out impure is to reproach the Lord Shankar indirectly dwelling in him. The death is particularly dreadful to him who is suspicious of the Lord’s existence in his own innerself or in other one’s. And at least ponder over in your mind how can the impurity be possible in the water? The vessel in which I have brought it is made of earth—and the earth also not common but heated well in the fire and then again it has already been purified by water. Which one of the earth, water and fire is impure? It is also not proper if you say that this water has become impure due to my contact; because you and I both are made of earth only and always live on the earth. If in my contact the water can be impure, the earth where I stand should also become impure due to my contact. Then, you will have to fly about in the sky leaving the earth. In the sight of these considerations your arguments seem to me completely absurd.’</p>
<p class="Text">Kalbhiti said—‘No doubt, Lord Shankar is present in all the beings. But with this view why does he who treats all the beings equal in behaviour not appease his hunger with earth or ashes instead of food grain? Because according to his opinion the Lord who is present in the food grain is present in the earth and ashes also. But his this opinion is not right. from the spiritual point of view despite every object being the form of Lord Shiva needs to be discriminated in behaviour. That is why different kinds of the methods of purification are found in the Shastras and its fruits are also differently directed. It is never proper at all to act against the ordains of Shastras. The Shastras that mention the Lord Shiva’s existence everywhere, the same Shastras have mentioned the rules of discrimination in behaviour also. How far is it proper to obey one rule of the Shastras and disobey the other one? Both the things are right with its own point of view and the both have its mutual connection also. Mind it, the creator created this formal creation in the beginning and joined it together in such a way by different names also cow is tied with rope. This earthly name as creation  is of four kinds—sound, letters (of alphabets), word and sentence. The form of sound is articulation the letter beginning with <span class="char-style-override-5">अ</span> (A) is noun. The group of letters is called word which is meaningful as (Repeat the name of Shiva). Here there are two words ‘<span class="char-style-override-5">शिवं’</span> ‘Shivam’ and <span class="char-style-override-5">‘भजेत्’</span> ‘repeat the name’. And the group of words mutually related is called sentence. As <span class="char-style-override-5">‘शिवं भजेत्’</span> ‘Repeat the name of Shiva’ this is the sentence—the group of words.</p>
<p class="Text">Sentence is of three kinds—(1) Related to the Lord (2) Related to the friend (3) Related to the beloved. As the rightful lord orders his servant to do any work and not to do any particular work and the work is done according to the order, similarly the ordains of ‘Shruti’ and ‘Smriti’ are worth obeying by us; there is no need of the least hesitation where about in it. That is why the sermons of ‘Smriti’ and ‘Shruti’ have been called the ‘Lord’s sermons’ (Prabhu Summit Updesha) the ‘history’ and ‘Puranas’ etc., the Shastras give us sermons of our interest in sweet words like friends—they instigate us towards our duty and mention the loss in failing to do it; that is why its sermons have been called the sermons of a friend. The sermons what we get through the literature and poetry, that is called the sermon pertaining to beloved; because the stanzas of literature ammusing us by different ways like a favourable wife give us the sermons of our interest in very sweet and charming words. ‘Shruti’ ordains us to maintain external and internal purity both. The same thing is stated by History and Puranas in these words—‘If you want to remain happy in the next world and want to be free from sufferings, then to follow the moral conduct is an essential duty for the people living on earth. In such a condition if ignoring the words of ‘Shruti’ ‘every object is the form of Shiva’ on the basis of this sentence if you want to remove the discrimination of behaviour then tell me, will the ‘Shruti’-‘Puranas’ etc., not prove worthless? If your view is correct then, the seven seers and others who are Brahmans and Kshatriyas master of their duties who have discharged their duties according to the Vedas and Shastras all are fools and what has been mentioned in the Shastras like those who abide in the quality of Sattva wend their wayupward those of a Rajasika disposition stay in the middle and men of Tamasika nature sink down. Sattvika meal promotes Sattva and Rajasika meal Rajoguna and Tamasika meal Tamoguna.</p>
<p class="Text">‘As what you say that Lord Shiva is present in all the beings that is right. Lord Shiva is All-pervading, it is true to the letter. Yet by the discrimination of men, the discrimination is in his entity can also be said. In its support I just quote an instance. Although all the ornaments of gold are made of a single metal that is gold even then the cost and colour of the gold is not the same. The gold of someone is perfectly pure. Gold  of another one is inferior to that of former. That gold of the third is of further lower quality But it is also admitted that the gold is there in all types of ornaments. Side by side it is also admitted truth that the gold of all the ornaments is not equal. In the same way Lord Shiva is present in all the beings certainly. His illumination in anyone is the most sacred but in the otherone that is not so pure and in the third one it is more impure. So with the point of view of the practical behaviour the equality cannot be maintained in all objects. Just as the gold of inferior quality gets superiority by the means of heating it in the fire, similarly the beings of gloomy innerself and the beings of gloomy body being purified by the bath etc., the means of purification become entitled of well-being (auspiciousness). By the means  of common purification sudden gain of perfect well-being (auspiciousness) is not possible, that is why in the Shastras the need of body-cleanliness has been directed. After the cleanliness of the body only the higher worlds of heaven etc., can be achieved. Thus, those wise men who have the desire of body purification don’t accept the food and water from anyone. Contrary to it, those who take the food and water from anyone without the consideration of pure conduct despite being of moral conduct become stupefied in a very short time being overpowered by the Tamoguna. So, I cannot accept your water. Kindly, excuse me for this. </p>
<p class="Text">To hear such a logical speech with the support of the Shastras that stranger became silent. With the thumbs of his feet he came to dig a big pit and he poured down the water of the pitcher into it. That big pit got overflowed with a little water of that pitcher yet there remained some water in the pitcher. With the remaining water of the pitcher he filled a pond with water situated just close. To see this business of miracle Kalbhiti was not the least surprised. He thought that generally, the persons adoring ghost etc., are expert in displaying miracles. But such kinds of wonders cannot affect the path given by the ‘Shruti’.</p>
<p class="Text">To see the firm determination of Kalabhiti that strange person disappeared laughing loudly. Kalabhiti also was extremely amazed to see this and he began to think about that man in different ways in a fix. Thus, when he was absorbed in thoughts, his sight was attracted abruptly towards the root of that wood apple tree. He saw that a large Shiva’s stone phallus had been established there all at once; all the ten direction had been illuminated with its lustre. In the space the demigods are singing sweet music and the fairies are dancing. The king of gods Indra is showering the rain of the flowers of coral tree on him and other gods and sages are also praying hymns to Lord Shankar applauding Him. Thus, there was a big festival there. Being overjoyed Kalbhiti also saluted the self-created Shiva’s stone phallus and he began to pray in this way—</p>
<p class="Text">‘I am seeking shelter to that Kaladhar, Kalakanth Mahakal who is the death of all sins who is the annihilator of this world and the ‘Yama’ of death even. You are the master of the entire knowledge, even the Vedas are incompetent to praise You. You are the overlord of all the beings God of gods and the father of Brahma even. I salute you again and again. O Shiva! This world is Your creation and you, yourself are the beginningless and end. Wherever and in whatsoever class of birth I am born, You shower the rain of Your compassion and mercy on me always. O the Lord! You are to do good in all respects, You are nourishing Trayambaka, I worship you with holy incense and other objects O Trilochan! As the ripe fruit of pumpkin falls down on the earth being detached from the branch, in the same way kindly, get me rid of the binding of death. O God! Being dispassionate from the world those who mutter Your six letters spell (Khatakshar Mantra). You are pleased with them and all the ascetics very soon. I constantly mutter the same <span class="char-style-override-5">‘ॐ नम: शिवाय’</span> (the spell of six letters). </p>
<p class="Text">To hear this hymn of the foremost devotee Kalabhiti Lord Shankar was very much pleased. He appeared in His manifested form from this Shiv’s stone phallus and illuminating all the three worlds with His divine splendour said to the Brahman—‘O the foremost Brahman! I am very much pleased with your worship of dire penance what you have practised in this holiest place of pilgrimage. Now, by My grace even the death cannot have any effect on you. It was I to put you on test for your steadfastness disguising Myself in the human body and I am happy you passed that test perfectly. That religion is really superior which is followed by the firm determined persons like you. The water that I had brought for you is the water of all the holy pilgrimages and is perfectly pure. I have filled the pit and pond with that water. The people will achieve a great fruit by the prayer of that mystic expressive hymn of praise by which you have prayed Me. Now, demand your desired boon from Me. Your worship has made Me so much pleased that nothing will be impossible to be given to you by Me.’</p>
<p class="Text">Kalabhiti said—‘Lord! Really I am highly blessed with Your pleasure what you have expressed for me. Actually, this is the righteousness what pleases you. That is not the righteousness which fails to satisfy you. Now, if you are pleased with me, my only prayer is to Your feet that you should always remain present in the stone-phallus,  the worship is performed to this stone-phallus may be the bestower of endless fruit. O Maheshwar! Since being appeared from this stone phallus you have made me free from the ‘Kala Marg’ forever, so this stone phallus should be famous in the world by the name of ‘Mahakal’ and the person who takes bath in this well and offers water to his ancestors, should get the auspicious fruit of taking bath all the holy places of pilgrimage and their ancestors should also get undecaying salvation. </p>
<p class="Text">To hear this selfless prayer of Kalabhiti, Lord Shankar was very much pleased and said—‘O the best of Brahmanas! There is no need of your prayer of My presence in this stone-phallus. Wherever the self stone-phallus are established positively I dwell there in all. O son! In the month of December January (Magh) on the fourteenth day of the moonlit dark fortnight whosoever offers water to his ancestors after taking bath in this well situated in the East of this stone phallus with the spell named ‘Shiv’ will be entitled of the fruit of the bath of all the pilgrimages and his ancestors will get the eternal state. On the night of that day the person who remains wakeful during night by worshipping this stone-phallus after the interval of every three hours will get the fruit of the worship of all the stone phallus of the world and everywhere fruit of wakefulness worship during nights. O the foremost Brahman! The man who worships this stone phallus being self restraint will certainly get the prosperity and deliverance both. In the month of December-January in the moonlit fortnight on the day of Monday or on the fourteenth or eighth day of the fortnight worships Mahakal after the bath in this pond will be entitled of the world of Shiva. As a result whatever the muttering, charity donation, penance meditation of the ‘Mantra’ is performed in the contact of Mahakal will be imperishable. And O Son! You have got victory over ‘Kalamarg’ by My worship, so by being famous by the name of Mahakal like Nandi you also will dwell in My world for long time as My attendant comfortably. After a few days, the royal sage, named Karandham will come to meet you at this very place, after giving him moral sermon you will come to My world! Lord Shankar vanished in that stone phallus after this version. Then after Mahakal also began to practise the penance staying there joyfullyat the place.</p>
<p class="Text">After sometime passed to hear the efficacy of the holy pilgrimage of Mahakal and the narrative of Mahakal’s character with the motive to know more about the spiritual truth the king Karandham came there. He worshipped so many other Shiva’s stone phallus there after taking bath in the Mahisagar and coming to the stone phallus of Mahakal sat down near it in a very pleasant mood being exhilarated. The king Karandham’s joy had no bound to see the sight of that Mahakal-stone-phallus; by the view of which the fruit of ten thousand muttering of the Panchakshar Mantra (the spell of five letters). He considered his life fruitful at that time. After that he worshipped the Mahakal-stone-phallus with ‘Mahamahopachar Mantra’ and then reaching the foremost devotee Mahakal he saluted him. To see the king coming the words of Lord Shankar came to Mahakal’s memory and he welcomed the king with smiling face coming before him and gave him warm reception by offering water to his hands and feet. After the formal query of well-being of the foremost devotee the personified peace Mahakal he made many questions concerning to the righteousnes and he gave the solution of the king’s questions by giving the answers according to the Shastras approval. The total gist of his sermon was to fulfil the duty according to the class of birth seeking shelter to the Lord by all means remaining engaged in His devotion for the sake of His love means remaining as householder in the worlds seeking Dharma, wealth and enjoyments after death the only means to achieve the salvation is to obey the ‘Maheshwara-Dharma’ in this world. </p>
<p class="Text">Thus, while Mahakal was giving the sermons of different righteous activities when suddenly a loud uproar began to resound in the sky. When Mahakal saw towards that side what he sees that Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Their attendants and along with Goddess Durga the Lord Shankar, Himself is coming. He is being accompanied by the gods like Indra etc., the foremost sage Vasishtha and Tamburu and other demigods. The most wise Mahakal leaving his seat gave reception to all of them with the consciousness of devotion and worshipped them in a number of ways. The gods as Brahma etc., getting Mahakal seated on the throne of the superior quality of gems and diamonds consecrated him in the area of Mahisagar confluence. The Goddess Bhagawati embracing him with the sentiment of affection got him seated in her lap and fondling like Her son said—‘O the son dedicated to the vow of Shiv! So long as this Cosmos exists you will dwell in the world of Shiva by the influence of your Lord Shiva’s devotion. Lord Maheshwara has already granted you the boon that anyone who being self-restraint and pious worships the Shiva’s-stone-phallus established by you will dwell in the world of Shiva after his death and he who views the sight makes prayer worships and adores this stone-phallus or does any auspicious deeds like donation in charity etc., in its contact will give great satisfaction to the Lord Shankar by his action? At that time, Brahma, Vishnu and other gods began to pray hymn and praise of Mahakal saying—‘Well done’. The bards began to praise his virtues and the demigods began to please him with the melodious songs. Crores of Shiva’s attendants surrounded him by singing in his praise. Thus with the unparalleled function the foremost devotee Mahakal went away to the world of Lord Shiv with the living body  accompanying his deity.</p>
<p class="Text">Even now-a-days, those who are engaged in the worship of the Shiv’s-stone-phallus established by Mahakal are embraced by Mahakal with great love and he prays the narrative of their worship before Shivaji and attracts the grace of Lord Shiva on them.</p>

<p class="Text">‘I repeat with veneration the name of Shri Ramachandraji whose body is dark like the cloud loaded with water, who is in beautiful yellow garment (Pitambara), whose hands are embellished with bow and arrow and whose waist is  equipped with quivers,eyes are broad and charming like lotus, whose head is covered with matted hair; who is graceful while going on the way with Sitaji, Lakshmanaji who is the source of pleasure to all.’</p>
<p class="Text">In the great pious land of India as the Ganga and Yamuna have been flowing from eternity, as the peaks of the Himalaya and Vindhya are enhancing her beauty, just like the same since the eternity the spontaneous and constant flow of saints and sages has been continuing in this country. The current of a divine electricity goes on circulating here in the atmosphere due to which even in the common beings have the confluence of three rivers of devotion, knowledge and dispassion which is wavy. Go to any common deserted village, start the discussion of the Lord with any individual, ask regarding devotion, start the discussion about knowledge, express your desire to know the glory of devotion, you will find in the course of discussion that the devotion of his heart is swelling up in his pimple, guileless speech. It seems that as if he has seen the Lord with his own eyes and is in practice of looking regularly. The mental impressions of knowledge and renunciation are mixed in our blood with the mother milk. ‘The entire land belongs to Lord’ <span class="char-style-override-5">‘सबै भूमि गोपालकी</span><span class="char-style-override-3">’</span> is on our lips only is not the fact but it is in our blood also. We have always been of the opinion that this world is only the ‘night shelter of the bird of soul’. And it is also not so that this divine conflunece of devotion, knowledge and renunciatin has been flowing in our particular province. Every particle of dust and even a single atom of Indian land is wet with the juice of this emotion. From Badri Narayana to Rameshwara and from Kamakhya to Kashmir its current has flown with the equal sentiment of smoothness. No doubt, it is another factor that the methods of worship have differed from place to place—somewhere the flow of ‘Vaishnava’ is dominant and somewhere ‘Shaiva’; somewhere Lord Krishna is worshipped and somewhere Lord Shri Rama, somewhere the worship of Lord Shiva is performed and somewheter of the goddess Durga, the symbol of power.</p>
<p class="Text">On the Western border of South India, there is sketched a thin row of hills. The ocean continuously washes the orbit of its feet. Such a beautiful land on the feet of mountains would be probably rare anywhere else in the world. Here, the greenary is found maintained in all the twelve months. It is here, there was a small village named ‘Shri Rangapuram’ on the bank of the river, ‘Tungabhadra’ consisting of one hundred to one hundred twenty-five houses. In a common Brahmana family of this ‘Shri Rangapuram’, Venkat was born at the mid of the day exactly on the day of ‘Shri Ramanavami’. This event is related to about two hundred and half years ago. The birth ceremony of the Lord Shri Ramachandraji was being celebrated with great pomp and show. The bells, gongs, conch-shells, sistrums, other musical instruments were being sounded and festive musical instruments were being played and sung and the whole village had resounded with the tumultuous sound of applaud. The fountains of delight were overflowing. Different types of sweets and dry fruits dishes were being distributed. There was mud due to sprinkling of curd mixed with turmeric. At such a joyous moment, Venkat took the first breath.</p>
<p class="Text">The family was small consisting of mother-father, two sisters and one brother. Venkat got the joint love of all of them together and the traditional sacraments of the family went on leaving its impact on his delicate heart. There was the Tulasi-platform in the courtyard of the house and on that terrace a beautiful idol of Shri Maruti pasted with Sindur was present there. On one corner of the terrace there was a huge flag of Shri Marutiji which used to hoist high in the sky. On every tuesday and saturday in the night, the festive of ‘Shri Marutiji’ was celebrated, the narratives used to be related, congregational singing was performed and in the last remaining Prasad was distributed. The old, elders, boys-youths, women, village children gathered there and with great zeal and enthusiasm  worshipped Shri Marutiji. Venkat’s father related the fables and got the congregation singing performed. The mother used to sit there with the child in her lap and followed others in the congregational singing. The congregational singing was performed with melodious tune playing on musical instruments. The child Venkat was yet stammering when he learnt many words of congregational singing and from his mouth <span class="char-style-override-4">‘Laghupati laghav laja lam’</span> seemed very pleasant and sweet. There used to remain the gathering of the boys and the girls in the Venkat’s house even in the day time. Well, how is brother Venkat? Please tell the least, <span class="char-style-override-5">‘रघुपति राघव राजा राम’</span> (Raghupati Raghava Rajarama) and just then Venkat started his singing in the sweet stammering tone. On his this congregational singing the mother-father were already charmed, the village people also said that Venkat would be a great devotee one day. Just since his small age he takes so much relish in the Lord’s name that on a little stimulation, he starts repeating the Lord’s name and he continues to say till he is made to stop.</p>
<p class="Text">Venkat had stepped in the fourth year of his age. The father had got him crammed several hymns of the Lord’s prayer. Whenever Venkat was alone or came near the platform before Shri Maruti, suddenly started repeating those hymns. Out of them two hymns were his favourite which he could recite in good musical tune—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">रामाय रामभद्राय रामचन्द्राय वेधसे। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">रघुनाथाय नाथाय सीतायाः पतये नमः॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">त्वमेव माता च पिता त्वमेव</p>
<p class="SHLOK">त्वमेव बन्धुश्च सखा त्वमेव। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">त्वमेव विद्या द्रविणं त्वमेव</p>
<p class="SHLOK">त्वमेव सर्वं मम देवदेव॥</p>
<p class="Text"> ‘I salute Lord Rama, Ramachandra, Raghunatha, the husband of Sita. You are my mother, You are my father too, You are my brother and friend too, You are the entire knowledge, You are my wealth and riches too. O Lord! You are the God of gods and all in all for me.’</p>
<p class="Text">These both hymns had been rooted in his heart. On every tuesday and saturday before the narrative started, Venkat recited these hymns with great love and narrative started. He had started participating in the congregational singing also with great love and brought all the boys of the village together. Sometimes leading himself, he used to perform the congregational singing—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम राम जय राजा राम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम राम जय सीताराम॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">भयहर दशरथनन्दन राम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">जय जय मंगल सीताराम॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">रघुपति राघव राजा राम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">पतितपावन सीताराम॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">जय रघुनन्दन जय घनश्याम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">जानकिवल्लभ सीताराम॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम राम जय राजा राम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम राम जय सीताराम॥  </p>
<p class="Text">‘Rama, Rama, Cheer to Raja Rama. Rama, Rama Jai (cheers) Sita Rama. O Rama! The son of Dasharath free me from fear. Jai Jai, to auspicious Sitaram. O the Lord of Raghus dynasty! Cheers to Sitaram, the purifier of the downfall. Jai to Rajaram, Rama Rama. Rama Rama Jai to Sitaram. Jai to the son of Raghus line, and jai to Ghanashyam. Jai to the husband of Sita, Sitaram.’</p>
<p class="Text">In the fables also Venkat had started taking keen interest. He listened to the fables very attentively. It seemed so that due to the impressions of the previous birth all the mysteries of the fables became clear to him automatically. Once, it was Tuesday; the narrative of the ‘<span class="char-style-override-4">Kishkindhakanda</span>’ of ‘<span class="char-style-override-4">Adhyatma Ramayana</span>’ was going on. The Lord Rama was describing the method of worship to His brother, Lakshman. It was a very beautiful reference going on. In the very beginning of the narrative one narration was very attractive to Venkat. Just at the beginning of narration, his father, as the narrator, said this hymn bowing on the feet of Shri Maruti—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यत्र यत्र रघुनाथकीर्तनं</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तत्र तत्र कृतमस्तकाञ्जलिम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">वाष्पवारिपरिपूर्णलोचनं</p>
<p class="SHLOK">मारुतिं नमत राक्षसान्तकम्॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘Giving the explanation of this hymn, he made it clear to the audience that—wherever there is the narration and congregational singing of Raghunathaji going on, Shri Hanumanji is sure to remain there and listens to the fable with folded hands with deep love and with tears in his eyes. He who wants to please Shri Raghunathaji, should please Hanumanji first, he should get his blessings. Thus, very easily in a very short time by the grace of Shri Maruti the unwavering devotion to the Lord’s feet is achieved. The worship of Shri Hanumanji never goes futile. He is moved towards his devotee very soon and directing him on the proper way remains safeguarding his spiritual practice day and night always, saves him from falling down and raises him up and in the last, he makes him join the Lord’s feet. Shri Maruti has involved a number of his devotees to the Lord’s feet and even now, those who worship him, get shelter in the Lord’s feet without the least doubt. After this fable proceeded onward. The Lord Rama is guiding his brother Lakshman—‘O the son of Raghus race, Lakshman! Turning the face from the affairs of the world remaining silent remembering and meditating Me the muttering should be performed. Then, remembering My name with love one should dance, sing, pray, recite and holding My charming image in the heart rolling down on the ground he should salute Me in prostration. The emotional remaining of the oblation given by Me ‘This is the remaining of Lord’s oblation’ with this sentiment he should place it on his head and being overwhelmed with emotion of devotion placing My feet on his head ‘O Lord! Save me from this fierce ocean of the world’ having said so, he should salute Me and should sip the sacred water of My feet and should worship Me with guileless heart through offering water to hands and, by sipping the sacred water of My feet, with bath, cloth, ornaments etc., whatever ingredients may be available. If he is rich he should worship Me daily with camphor, saffron, ‘Aguru’, sandal and with fragrant flowers of higher quality chanting the spells and offering light (adoration of God with five tapers) of worship to Me is fruitful quickly. Even a single palm of water offered to Me by My devotee with love and devotion is the cause of My pleasure. Then incense, flower and rice and are much more pleasure giving. The main concern is attitude. I am hungry of the sentiment. With the feelings of heart if merely two or three leaves of Tulasi and water of a palm are offered to Me with emotion, that is sufficient to have sway over Me.’</p>
<p class="Text">The narrative related today was instilled in Venkat’s heart. He decided to himself that he would view the divine sight of Shri Ramachandraji by the worship of Shri Maruti. What a fantastic is this craving, what an auspicious is this passion, how divine is this greed, how lovely is this  longing, what supernatural is this attachment!</p>
<p class="Text">The temptation to know more and more about Shri Marutirai went on increasing in the heart of Venkataraman. When in the night after taking dinner, he came to his father and asked—‘Babuji! Narrate any sportive display of Shri Hanumanji, relate his any story.’ The father got a great pleasure from this inquisitiveness of his child and he narrated daily something about the character of Shri Hanumanji. Venkat remained exhilarating his father’s heart responding with his words ‘yes, well,  how is it so, cheers, was it so?’ The father told the child with great love that in the moonlit fort night of March-April (Chaitra) month on tuesday in full moon-lit night the Lord Shankar, Himself incarnated in the form of divine monkey from the  womb of mother Anjana. This is Hanumanji. His father’s name is Kesari. From the very childhood Hanumanji was very naughty. One day, in the morning, he felt hungry and he did not find anything in the house to eat. His sight fell on the rising sun. He thougtht that this was a very nice red fruit. Then, why to wait, he did fly in the sky at once. Anyhow, the sun could save his life. From the very beginning, he was very restive. He used to hang the seats of the sages on the trees having lifted them up, he used to pour down the water of their ‘Kamandalu’ (vessels of water), tore off their loin cloth, sometimes remained playing sitting in the lap of the sages and abruptly scratching their beard ran away.</p>
<p class="Text">These fables gave wonderful pleasure to Venkat. He preseumed if he, himself had been Hanumanji, how nice it would have been. If I had power to fly, I would have flied in the sky always and sat on the top of the trees. I would have come down when my father or mother would call me, and if my mind did not permit, I would not come down. They would be disturbed very much after me. I would harassed them more and more.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, daily the fables went on being narrated—sometimes any episode, sometimes any other episode. Sometimes the making friendship with Sugriva and sometime the amazing sportive display of crossing the sea with colossal body as a mountain of gold  in search of Sita, sometimes the story of conversation  with Vibhishana was related and sometimes the incident of giving the ring of the Lord Shri Raghunathaji to the mother Janakiji in ‘Ashok Vatika’ was described. The event of inflaming Lanka was very interesting to Venkat. He asked his father about each and every occurence—‘Well Babuji! How did Hanumanji increase his tail in Lanka, whether the entire cloth of Lanka wrapped to his tail? Was the hundreds of mounds of oil sprayed on his tail? Then, how did he jump so high with such a large tail and how did he spring from one parapet to another? The father used to satisfy every eagerness of his child with great love-related each and every occurence and while relating he got much pleasure. After relating the whole fable, he said in the end—‘Only for the cause eof the Lord Shri Ram, Hanumanji was born and constantly, he remained absorbed in the memory of the Lord. Even today the devotees get the ‘Darshana’ (view) of Hanumanji ‘The boundless grace and the whole strength of the Lord is for me’ this conviction always was in the heart of Hanumanji.</p>
<p class="Text">One day the father of Venkat was explaining his child with great love that this is the characteristic of Hanumanji’s life that whosoever comes in his contact, he makes his reach in the contact of the Lord by somehow or the other. He made Vibhishan’s contact with the Lord possible, he got Sugriv meet the Lord, he got Tulasidas meet the Lord. His sole job is the service of the Lord and to help the person seeking shelter to the Lord. Venkat had already heard the stories of Vibhishan and Sugriv before hand. Today, he expressed his eagerness to hear the story of Tulasidas with great love the father said in detail that at any place the narrative of Shri Ramayana was related daily. In the disguise of an old Brahman Shri Hanumanji used to come there daily. He was the first to come and go in the last when all had gone away after the distribution of the oblation. Tulasidas recognised him and caught his feet. Then what, he appeared in his original form. Then by his grace, Tulasidas got the view of Shri Rama-Lakshman apparently at Chitrakut. In his innerself, Venkat felt that he, himself was Tulasidas and he had got the apparent view of the Lord by the grace of Hanumanji. Today, he got such a point that gave him a great pleasure in heart. He was today dancing being intoxicated in emotion. He was getting sure in his mind that he would get the apparent sight of the Lord because this is the sportive display of Hanumanji.</p>
<p class="Text">By and by Venkat grew up young. In 9th year of his age his sacred thread ceremony was duly performed. He got the initiation from the mouth of his ‘Guru’ (preceptor) in ‘Gayatri-Mantra’ along with the <span class="char-style-override-5">‘ॐ हरि:’</span> (Om Hari). By the permission and blessing of mother-father, he was sent to ‘Gurukul’ for getting education.</p>
<p class="Text">Madura has the same rank and place in South India what Kashi has in north India. Kashi has been the chief institute of learning of North India since the ancient time. All the students of North India are in practice of coming to Kashi for the practice of knowledge after sacred thread ceremony.</p>
<p class="Text">Even today after their sacred thread ceremony the children beg for alms from their parents saying that—‘Mother! Give me alms, I go to Kashi to acquire education. Probably it may be prevailing in the society only as a formality; but it is a great pious memory of our holy sacraments. Near, Madura also there is a small river—the name is ‘Vaikai’. On the bank of this very river at the distance of about ten to twelve miles from Madura there was a small hermitage where Venkat came for learning. He saluted the feet of the preceptor in prostration and he began to live there by his permission. Slowly and slowly he studied methodically according to the rules of the Vedas and the six branches of the Vedas, Philosophy, Smriti, Purana, History, astronomy etc., all the religious treaties. His intelligence was very sharp, his wit was excellent. To memorise anything to hear it only once was very easy for him. He heard anything from the mouth of the preceptor only once, he learnt it forever. The ‘Guruji’ was charmed with his merits; he was amazed at his knowledge and at the excellence of his wit. Generally while teaching he used to say to the other students ‘if there is any celibate he should be like Venkataraman. Thus, having passed completely sixteen years in the hermitage of the preceptor Venkat returned home by the permission of the preceptor after the convocation. The hermitage had already its impression on him. By the lustre of celibacy his face was glittering. When the knowledge enter the innerself basically, it illuminates the innerself with the lustre of Brahma. All the bindings of the soul are cut asunder. He gets such a master key with the support of which he solves all the secrets of the world. Before him this world and all the other worlds reveal their heart. And he remains stood unmoved taking the base what is the gist of absolute truth in the depth of the spiritual truth. For him the outer books are closed and the pages inside start opening. The entire mystery is inside on the outer side there is only a dim reflection of the innerside. Whatever is that is all in the innerside, that is inside the heart and without openning the door of the heart, the fundamental truth is not known. The same external sight turns towards the innerside, it is successful in searching out its treasure, having lost which it has been wandering about.</p>
<p class="Text">Venkataraman determined the way of his life. By going into the depth of the Vedas—its six branches Upanishad, Puran etc., he got the view of only (Om Hari). To see his faithful observance of celibacy without break ceaslessly rememberance of ‘Om Hari’ the family members did not bring any proposal of marriage  before him to see his exclusive dedication. The father was very happy that his son was continuously proceeding onward on the virtuous path. He didn’t intervene at all. Venkatraman got up daily early in the morning being free from bath, prayer and offering of the water to manes he recited in a rhythm some hymns of the Vedas and some spells of Upanishad and then he used to sit on the seat being concentrated before the idol of Shri Maruti and completely for six hours he muttered (Om Hari). In the afternoon whatever was ready in the house he took it considering the remaining oblation of the Lord and then, he made some self study. On the third watch of the day he sat for the muttering and for four hours he muttered ‘Om Hari’ through breath. His interest towards muttering went on increasing. It was natural for him to mutter according to schedule in the rest time also he used to repeat it to himself. It resulted so that in the night even while sleeping his muttering continued. He didn’t feel any suffering, labour or inconvenience at all, rather to say he took delight more and more, he felt a divine pleasure in it. </p>
<p class="Text">Just as his bent of mind went on attracting towards muttering, in the same propotion his desire of lonliness also went on inceasing. Sometimes in the moonlit night sitting on the bank of Tungbhadra river all alone when he got absorbed in the meditation of ‘Om Hari’ it seemed that from his every root of hair ‘Om Hari’, ‘Om Hari’, its rays were coming out and inside and outside both this spell (Mantra) was fluctuating in these charming divine letters. Sometimes being drowned in this spell in such a way as  he began to float as the fish going to the bottom of the sea in their carefreeness swim right-left, upward and downward. Such a wonderful show in the spell (Mantra) that he is in the spell and the spell is in him! The people will call it ‘show’ only; but for Venkatraman it was a clear fact. Sometimes he used to see the sport of the sweet moon-light falling on the waves of the river-like spell-bound; like astonished! There also the charming sportive display of ‘Om Hari’ was visible to him. Sometimes raising his eyes he stared towards the numerous stars in the boundless sky and he preceived the view of ‘Om Hari’ in the inner world of all the stars. In the palpitation of his heart the sound of ‘Om Hari’ was clearly heard to him,  in his breath also he heard only the same spell (Mantra) Even in his inner soul of life the light of the same Mantra was visible to him; Wherever his eyes cast the look, wherever his mind roamed, wherever the sight turned, whatever his wit pondered over—everywhere only the spurt of ‘Om Hari’ remained charming him. Completely eleven months passed in this practice of penance, but to Venkat it seemed that it was yesterday only when he has got engrossed on this path. Basically it is true also. Those who engage themselves in the practice of spiritual exercise with the condition, how and what can they know the taste of the practice of penance? The Lord will be achieved by so much muttering, by maintaining silence so many days, by so much self-study, by keeping fast on so many Ekadasi, by the study of the particular religious book so much recitation—then they will get rid of the hard penance—thinking so those who step on the path of penance; what will they get except disappointment? The Lord is not bound by the conditions, he is tied only by love, by sole exclusive love! Without love and perseverance the spiritual exercise of numberless years is not dear to the Lord in comparision to the penance with the emotion of love of a single moment. There should be fondness for the Lord. The main thing is attachment and craving. Well! This is another issue that the mind may not be concentrated in the beginning, love might not be created, then the mind should be forced to engage in the devotional songs. Later on by the grace of the Lord the sentiment of love and attachment will be created and when it is created, there is left nothing.</p>
<p class="Text">Today it was the anniversary of Shri Hanumanji. It was a fanfare throughout the day at the house of Venkat. The people remained awakened till the midnight—the devotional song went on with great enthusiasm, the stanzas were recited, the fables were related, the forceful acclamation of the name of Shri Marutirai resounded in the atmosphere, the oblation was distributed. All went away to their homes. But a strange revolution in the mind of Venkataraman had broken out. Just after the festive finished, having taken the mixture of milk, sugar, ghee, honey and curd secretly and silently he slipped away and moved towards the river. It was the mid-night of the full moonlit fortnight of March-April, the bank of sand, the blast of spring air, the playfulness of the air intoxicated with the pollen of the wild flowers. Venkat sat down in the meditation of his deity, Shri Maruti. Just sitting he was concentrated to the meditation and he heard clearly the loud sound of Shri Marutirai in his innerself. There he saw that he was coming onward with the army of numberless monkeys–slowly and slowly all the monkeys disappeared and it was Marutirai, left alone. He was looking towards Venkat with the affectionate sight and having placed his right hand on Venkat’s head, he was blessing him. Now, Venkat could not control himself. He felled down at his feet and in the joyful mood he fainted. In the divine state of unconsciousness Venkat felt that Shri Hanumanji was writing ‘Om Hari’. On the screen of his heart in golden letters with his index finger. Today Venkatraman got the divine oblation of Shri Maruti.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, generally, in the night when all were asleep, Venkat began to meet Shri Maruti in the lonliness on the bank of Tungabhadra river. He experienced as if Shri Maruti was already waiting for him from beforehand. He bowed down his head to his feet and made his bosom wet with his tears. And then, Shri Hanumanji, causing him to sink in the waves of his affection led him to Shri Saketaloka, the Supreme abode of his master. There, he viewed the sight of regular merry making of frolic and fun of Shri Raghunathaji in the place of sportive display. The sight of that place was a great divine and most auspicious—</p>
<p class="Text">There is a large pavilion of gold beneath the ‘Kalpa Vriksha’ (the tree fulfilling all desires) under it there a very beautiful throne of gems and diamons. There Shri Ramachandraji along with Shri Sitaji is present on it. He is of dark colour like the novel grass leaf. His eyes are broad like the lotus petals, His countenance is really excellent. On His broad forehead there is embellished the upward mark of sandal. There are His black curly hair. On this head there is the crown brilliant like crores of suns. There is a great charm charming the mind of sages. In the neck there is the necklace of gems and jewels and the garlands of flowers. The body is pasted with the sandal. There are bow and arrow in his hands. His lips are red the sweet smile is overspreading on it, on the left side, the mother Sitaji is sitting. She is bright like gold. She is in the blue ‘Sari’ and there is red lotus flower in her hand. Her all the body-limbs are embellished with ornaments. It is a supernatural, most bewitching glimpse.</p>
<p class="Text">Venkat’s life was blessed to get this divine glimpse.</p>
<p class="Text">How long this merrimaking of sportive display continued, Venkat was unaware of it. One day son of Anjani Shri Hanumanji being pleased asked him—‘Tell me son! What do you want?’ Venkat could not speak anything; but yet the temptation came to his mind that the dearest object of Shri Hanumanji should be seen, Shri Hanumanji came to understand his mind. He said—‘Well! Now see and hear the most favourite dearest object of my life even dearer than my life.’ Having uttered so, taking the musical instrument ‘Kartal’ in his both the hands, he began to perform congregational singing being completely immersed.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">जय सीताराम सीताराम </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सीताराम जय सीताराम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">जय सीताराम सीताराम </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सीताराम जय सीताराम॥ </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-3">Foremost devotee Hanumanji’s divine congregational singing is the purifier of all the three worlds. He always remains engrossed in this congregational singing. But the congregational sing today is heard by only Venkataraman and what is his condition, only any great fortunate devotee can describe. The tone of the congregational singing went on growing deepper and deeper and the cool and sweet rays of light seemed to becoming close slowly and slowly. Shri Raghunathaji along with mother Janaki appeared there apparently and satisfied very well to His devotee Shri Hanuman and His devotee Venkataraman with His mild and gentle smile. Venkat’s soul merged into the Lord.<span></span></p>

<p class="Text">‘That Shyamsundar, elegant with three bends of the body and charming to the whole world! How lovely and charming is His appearance! He is wearng the beautiful earnings hanging to the shoulders! The eye-brows are stretched towards upward, a bit shrivelled very tender his lips are! His eyes are side long and broad. Standing under the ‘Kalpa-Vriksha’ (the tree fulfilling all desires) that master of merry making, the foremost actor of dance cum song (especially connected with Lord Krishna and Radha) spinning His tender fingers slowly and slowly is playing on His flute in the jocund mood. Why and where should the mind divert leaving this wealth of heart?’</p>
<p class="Text">How affectionate is Manamohan! He is making Gokul spellbound and restless with the melodious mild tune of His charming flute. May that dark charming (Krishna) from whose whole body the waves of the rays of beauty coming out, are submerging the consciousness of the devotees with love, joy—that ‘Natnagar’ (Lord Krishna) to steal of the heart of the maidens and ascetics—that Muralimanohar (Krishna) of charming appearance that dearest of the Gopis dwell in our hearts!</p>
<p class="Text">From the eternity that flute is continuing to be played. In the fierce uproar of the world we fail to hear it. We don’t enter the Vrindavana of our heart, then, how to hear? That supreme lover has been attracting the beings as a whole towards Him with His divine words, divine touch, divine fragrance, divine appearance and divine juice of love. It is not known since when he has been attracting. The manifested words of Mohan’s flute, the manifested touch in the smooth tender parts of the body like lotus, and the coolness and smoothness of the garland of flowers, the manifested scent in His divine body-smell and deer-musk, the manifested scent in the mark of sandal and ‘Aguru’, the manifested appearance in the yellow garment (Pitambara) and peacock feather and in the ornaments as crocodile-pendants, ring, anklets etc., fascinating look of the actor of dance and song with three bends of the body the manifested sentiment is overflowing. In this pathway of emotion, sometime the Lord’s appearance, sometimes sentiment, sometimes touch, sometimes smell and sometimes words compell the heart of the devotees completely to attract towards Him. Sometimes the tinkling of His anklets is heard and sometimes the glittering light of His earring spread away the rays of light in the heart, sometimes the mind got entangled with His dark and curly hair, sometimes the heart got stuck in His curved eye-brows. He whom one looks once becomes fulfilled forever. I am bathing my heart with the nectar of love by the life sketch of such a loving devotee. The loving readers should drink this juice with open heart, should be overwhelmed with the emotion of heart.</p>
<p class="Text">Even today a divine spiritual atmosphere is experienced by the devotees in the great pious land of Chitrakut. That is a holy land and that is considered the best place for the spiritual exercise. Several saints and devotees get the direct vision of the Lord’s divine frolicsome activities. The blaze of Ansuyaji is ignited there even today and the bath of Mandakini is fruitful very soon to the reverents. Lalitcharana was born in a small village near Chitrakut in a Vaishya family several hundreds of years ago on the very eighth day of the dark night of Bhado (Bhadrapada), the eighth day of Bhado is very sacred for the Hindus as a whole. The hearts of the Sadhaks is sweetly connected with it because on this day they visualise the dearest of soul Lord Hari apparently in their innerself removing the curtain of their heart and fondle excessively. On such a pious auspicious festive, Lalitacharana blessed the womb of his mother. To get the touch of the devotee’s feet this earth is flourished with joy, the mother-father are fulfilled and that country and family become blessed.</p>
<p class="Text">Lalitacharana was the only fondled son of his mother-father, so their boundless affection and fondling used to shower on him day and night. He was the star of their eyes. His separation of a single moment was unbearable to them. The father remained on the shop and the mother discharged the domestic chores. Being free from bath etc., the father recited ‘Hanumanchalisa’ and the mother offered the water to the root of the basil. She offered water to Surya Narayan and then, offered leaf-flower and oblation to Hanumanji. This was their daily routine. Lalita, too, remained engaged with his mother-father and marked their all activities with curious eyes. Whatever the mental impressions are formed in the childhood are never purged like the line skretched on the unripe earthen pitcher. Only in the age of five to six years, he crammed whole Hanumanchalisa and with great love and interest sitting with his mother related one recitation to Hanumanji. The reading of Hanumanchalisa in the sweet voice full of love appealed the parents very much. Bowing their head to the feet of Hanumanji with great love and devotion they prayed to him that their son’s mind should concentrate to the Lord’s feet a prayer made with true emotion of love never goes fruitless. Any sort of desire whether worldly or other worldly after being offered to the feet of the Lord becomes divine and auspicious. And how fine it is to make prayer in the Lord’s feet for the love and devotion! While granting the boon of love and devotion Lord feels overjoyed.</p>
<p class="Text">And Hanumanji is the ocean of grace. The emancipation of the devotees and to make their reach of the deserved to the Lord’s feet is his sole job. Throughout the day and night, he remains in search who is that devotee restless and eagerly longing for the Lord. To see the restlessness and being under the spell of pity, he attaches the heart of the striver of the spiritual exercise to the Lord’s feet. The work of mediation which is done by Hanumanji so skillfully as cannot be done by any other one. There is the reason that he always remains in search of the devotees day and night and he strengthens their love to the Lord’s feet and remains maintaining the shadows of his grace on them, protects them from any harm, motivates them towards the deity turns the whole current of emotion towards the Lord. He takes the entire responsibility of their well being on his own shoulders, he remains giivng them support and remains encouraging them. After seeking shelter of Shri Hanumanji’s feet nothing more is required to be done. He fulfils all the works in the twinkling of an eye. This is the experience of the devotees.</p>
<p class="Text">Lalitacharan’s love to Shri Hanumanji and Hanumanchalisa went on increasing. He went away into the worshipp room just after taking bath and wearing clean washed clothes and recited in the loveful voice with choked throat. Sometimes while reciting he felt that Hanumanji had put his hands on his head in person and was bathing him with the nectar of His affectionate look. At such a time naturally the constant overflow of tears from Lalitacharan’s eyes started—His recitation slopped and a number of hours passed in the strange divine intoxication. The mother-father got a great joy from their son’s love to God.</p>
<p class="Text">Once it was a time, that the <span class="char-style-override-4">‘Rasalila’</span> was being staged in the neighbouring village. By chance, Lalitacharan had also reached there. That day it was the play of acting the lamentation of Gopis on the separation of Krishna. The Lord Shri Krishna is going to Mathura from Vrindavan. With this heart-shaking news a female friend goes to Radhikaji. Just hearing this news being at wit’s end, she starts lamenting—what should I do, where should I go? Nothing is pleasant to my mind, O! These cruel breaths even don’t leave! Which country should I go for my dearest of life? What wil lbe that face to cool my heart early in the morning after the night passes away? My dearest of heart is going away to a far away country, how will I bear His separation? I will end my life jumping into the sea, so that I may escape from other’s sight, otherwise, I will be wandering about in the country and abroad in the form of a female ascetic making the dearest of life the garland of my neck. The same (Krishna) who accompanied me day and night, in whose company the night and day were out of my mind, in whose company, I enjoyed different joys and comforts, enjoyed different kinds of pleasures, is ready to depart suddenly. ‘O Alas!’ thus, expressing manifold piteous words and without caring for the public shame etc., the women of Vraj began to wail and cry loudly—‘O Govind! O Damodar!! O Madhav!!!’ </p>
<p class="Text">On one side the Gopies were weeping and here Lalitacharan was weeping. Today, all of a sudden, he found himself absorbed in the sentiments of the Gopis. He was in this strange condition for hours long. His bosom was drenched with tears. His sighs and sobs were spontaneous. The agony of separation, inactive in the heart came to awaken. His condition just turned to Mira’s condition, who was mad in love—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">हे री मैं तो प्रेम-दिवानी, </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मेरो दरद न जाने कोय॥ टेक॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सूली ऊपर सेज हमारी </p>
<p class="SHLOK">किस बिधि सोना होय। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">गगन-मँडल पै सेज पियाकी </p>
<p class="SHLOK">किस बिधि मिलना होय॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">घायलकी गति घायल जाने, </p>
<p class="SHLOK">की जिन लाई होय। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">जौहरीकी गति जौहरी जाने, </p>
<p class="SHLOK">की जिन जोहर होय॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">दरदकी मारी बन-बन डोलूँ, </p>
<p class="SHLOK">बैद मिला नहिं कोय। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मीराकी तब पीर मिटै जब </p>
<p class="SHLOK">बैद साँवलिया होय॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘Mira is mad in love, my agony is not known to none else. She says—‘O! I am intoxicated in love. None is here to experience  the pain of my heart. My bedstead is on the trident, how to sleep? The bed of my dearest husband (Shri Krishna) is in the space, how to meet Him? It is only the wounded who knows the condition of the wounded. The jeweller knows the condition of a jeweller or the woman who resorted to self-immolation. Mira says that she wanders about from forest to forest being afflicted with pain but no physician could be available. Mira says that she will be free from pain only when Krishna, Himself comes as a physician.’</p>
<p class="Text">Really, the heart of the man is made of like the thunderbolt or steel if his eyes are not filled with tears by the remembrance of Lord’s name; his body is not horipilated, his soul doesn’t come to writh to meet that dearest of life and soul, the Lord. Lalitacharana’s heart is writhing today being restless for the Lord. In a single moment, Shri Krishna appears in his heart, and the next moment, He hides Himself. Today, he wants to catch that ‘fraudulent’ (Shri Krishna). But who could catch ‘Him’ (Shri Krishna)? He appears in the heart for a moment to blaze up the fire place of separation as if the full moon of the moonlit night is rising in the stainless sky—and creates the dreadful storm for the endless time in the heart to hide after a moment. He appears forcibly—to tempt to tentalise, to make restless. If you run to catch Him, He hides not known where? He has been acting this sportive display of hide and seek with the embodied being since eternity and will continue it till eternity.</p>
<p class="Text">The ‘Rasalila’ was going on. Uddhavji has come back to Mathura to see the agonised condition of Gopies and he is describing the condition of Radhikaji in a very pathetic tone—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">चित दै सुनौ स्याम प्रबीन। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">हरि! तुम्हारे विरह राधा मैं जु देखी छीन॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तज्यो तेल तमोल भूषन, अंग बसन मलीन। </p>

<p class="SHLOK">जब सँदेसो कहन सुन्दरि, गवन मो तन कीन। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">खसि मुद्रावलि चरन अरुझरी, गिरि धरनि बलहीन॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कंठ बचन न बोल आवै, हृदय असुवनि भीन। </p>

<p class="SHLOK">उठी बहुरि सँभारि भट ज्यों, परम साहस कीन। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">'सूर' प्रभु कल्यान ऐसे, जियहिं आसा लीन॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘O clever Shyam! Listen to the condition of Radha with concentrated mind. O Hari! In the anguish of your separation what I saw Radha, she has emaciated, physically. She has given up using oil, folded betel leaf, ornaments, the garments of her body have gone dirty. She has dug her bracelet into the pit taking it off from her arms. When I conveyed her the message, her ring slipped from her finger and fell down on the feet and she fell down on the ground due to the lack of energy. She was unable to speak any word and the overflow of tears made her heart completely wet. She wept the full tears of her eyes like a destitute stricken by calamity. Again controlling herself and how gathering her courage she rose up like a fallen down warrior. Suradasji says—‘O Lord! Do good to such one hopeless from life.’</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna! What do you ask about the condition of Radhika! Really, her condition is strange and pitiable. She remains moving out in the house. Without any reason, she bursts to laughter. She remains expressing her feelings regarding You only before all whether animate or inanimate. Sometimes she rolls down in the dust and sometimes she starts trembling bitterly. O Hari! What should I say, that Radha of moon like face makes strange endeavour like bewildered in the intoxicate grief of Your separation.</p>
<p class="Text">Lalitacharan felt that it was not Uddhavaji describing the condition of Radha to Shri Krishna but it was apparent Hanumanji, who was describing the grief of separation of his favourite devotee, Lalita to Shri Krishna. After coming back from the <span class="char-style-override-4">Ramalila</span>, Lalitacharan remained for many days in the same rapturous state of love. Eating, drinking nothing appealed to his mind. Neither he said to anyone nor heard anyone. The whole day and night, he passed in tears. Well! Sometimes in this duration the recitation of Shri Hanumanchalisa was in continuation, because he was of firm conviction that everything has been achieved by the grace of Shri Hanumanji only. One day, in the night, he saw a dream—‘Now, going to Vrindavan see the image of Shri Ranganathji—Your desires will be fulfilled there. The Lord has accepted you to His feet.’ On coming to senses after dream, Lalitacharan understood the indications of Hanumanji clearly and now, he began to make preparation to go to Vrindavan. What was there for preparation? On this pathway self-made preparation doesn’t work. The entire attraction is from that side and when that attraction becomes dominant, it doesn’t take time at all in the detachment from the home, family, mother-father etc., at all. There was only one thing revolving about in the mind of Lalitacharan—‘O the sense of feet! Now move for Vrindavan. O the sense of sight! Observe the beauty of Vrindavan, O the sense of speech! recite the hymns in praise of the merits of Vrindavan heard by ears, O the sense of smell! Experience the fragrance of Vrindavan and O body! Roll down again and again being horipilated in the area of playful activity of Lord Krishna in Vrindavan. In the charming groves of Vrindavan moving about when will I forget everything to remember the wonderful and lovely couple of Madhav and Shri Radha, lustrous like gold and sapphire? When will I fall down on the ground being fainted in the rapture of love to see the both living and wonderful images of Krishna and Kishoriji being one souled in swarthy and white coloured manifested glittering form before my eyes while moving about in the lanes of Vrindavan? He who remained intoxicated in the love of the Lord day and night how long could he bear His separation?</p>
<p class="SHLOK">कौन-सी है वह जुदाई की घड़ी जो उम्र भर। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">आरजूए वस्लमें यह दिल भटकता ही रहा॥  </p>
<p class="Text">‘What is that moment of separation, in which craving of union in this heart remained wandering throughout life?’</p>
<p class="Text">Lalita determined that this house and family is to be forsaken one day. He prepared himself to set out for Vrindavana. In the night again in the dream Hanumanji having appeared whispered in his ears ‘the Vasudev mantra’ of twelve letters and left a basil-garland. The next day, early in the morning, Lalita set out towards Vrindavan. The ripple of Lord’s love was undulating all around. To see it the eyes have got scared—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">दरियाए इश्क बह रहा लहरोंसे बेशुमार।  </p>
<p class="Text">‘The river of love is flowing through the excess of waves.’</p>
<p class="Text">Just reaching Vrindavan, Lalita’s condition changed otherwise—as if the separated wife from the ages has come back to her husband’s house. The living beings as a whole are restless to meet that Lord. He stops either here or there. But he does not get consolation from any object—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">भूली जोबन मन्द कर अरी बावरी बाम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यह नैहर दिन दोय को अंत कंतसे काम॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘That mad lady forgot her youth. She thought that the paternal house was short lived. At last, she had to join her husband.’</p>
<p class="Text">Lalita reached directly to the temple of Shri Ranganath. His body was covered with dust. His hair had gone tangled—but what is the relation of a lover to his body? A lover forgets everything in the love of his beloved—becomes the beggar of the street. And as regards God-devotees, what is to say of them and as much secret the love is so much deep it wounds. On disclosing it its beauty fades away.</p>
<p class="Text">Throughout the day, Lalita remained sitting on the steps of the temple and in the night, he went away in the groves of ‘Karil’. There he got the view of the Lord’s activities—sometimes, he saw Gopal Krishna’s stealing of butter and sometime dance with the Gopis, sometimes, he saw the sportive display of ‘Rasa’ and sometimes he visualised the stealing of clothes. One by one all the frolicsome activities were revealed to him. Sometimes joining ‘Rasalila’ he, himself, danced with the Lord—the right hand also in the hands of Shri Krishna and the left hand also in His hand where he lives and what he eats and drinks, none knew it. He, himself was unaware of how this all was happening. An old great soul used to give him bread and butter milk—he used to go away on the bank of the Yamuna river with it and having taken it and after drinking two to four handfuls of water used to move carefree. The garland of basil leaves given by Hanumanji was in his neck and the ‘Vasudev-mantra’ was in his heart-constantly alive form! All the appearance coming before his eyes, all the names heard to his ears—had become the sole image of Shri Krishna and the name of Shri Krishna. All the forms had merged in that queer form, all the names had merged in that divine Name. Whatever he heard from his ears, it was only Shri Krishna, who was heard to him; whatever he perceived with his eyes it was only Shri Krishna visible to him.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यारको हमने जा-बजा देखा;</p>
<p class="SHLOK">कहीं जाहिर कहीं छिपा देखा।</p>
<p class="Text">  ‘Wherever I saw the friend (lover), I saw him somewhere apparent and somewhere hidden.’</p>
<p class="Text">That charming wonderful glimpse if once comes in the temple of the heart, the entire picture is changed. And then after, nothing appeals to the mind. The countenance of that lover always remains hanging in the eyes, in the heart, in the mind, in the inner-self—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तेरी सूरतसे नहीं मिलती किसीकी सूरत, </p>
<p class="SHLOK">हम जहाँमें तेरी तस्वीर लिये फिरते हैं।  </p>
<p class="Text">‘The countenance of anyother one doesn’t look like yours wherever I wander about with Your photograph.’</p>
<p class="Text">Fifteen-sixteen years passed like a moment in  this intoxication of love, the whole times passed in one  relish and one sentiment. Lalita was not now Lalitacharana; now he had turned to be Lalita, the female friend. The whole day and night being monotingual she was enjoying as the comfortable, joyous bed partner of her lover—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">रमते रहते हैं सदा, देखते लीला उसकी, </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कल कहीं, आज कहीं, प्रात कहीं, रात कहीं। </p>
<p class="Text">‘Remains wandering about always seeing His frolicsome activities, yesterday somewhere else and today somewhere else, morning passed anywhere and night somewhere else.’</p>
<p class="Text">In the course of time the auspicious moment of marriage happened to reach. That revered wedding is the climax of the strivers of spiritual exercise. Well, he is lost in love forever. On that night the striver decorates himself with elegant make up, because, this night of today is the night of union, great union, auspicious, pleasant and the entire make up is internal. Today, Lalita had become ‘Lalita’ basically—well decorated with all sixteen kinds of makeup. This amatorial marriage! This sweet joining of the beloved and lover! Today is the unparalleled festivity of Rasa. In all the groves of Vrindavan the divine intoxication is dancing—The charming Shyamsunder of three bend body played on his flute, having scattered the clouds full of water, amazing the king of demigods, Tumburu rising up, diverting the minds of ascetics like Sanand etc., stunning Brahmaji and reaching below in nether world causing great curiosity and unsteadingness to the king Bali shaking the serpent king Anantadev breaking out the wall of the universe cauldron Lord’s flute sound spfead over all around the boundless infinity.</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Krishna visited with His chief eight female friends the show of dance-cum-song. Then, thousands of Gopies came there. Really, they are the most fortunate who hear the call of this divine flute music and to hear it set out on the path of love to the Lord without caring for the propriety of the family and world. Then, the union is a must, it is certain. Today, Lalita, too followed the path of the flute-tune of Hari with open heart.
