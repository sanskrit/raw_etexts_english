title = "A yogin and hisxa0dUtI"

+++
Being fooled by the outward appearance of a prescription in a tantra, or
by his instincts, or in modern times by pop culture, the common
practitioner is incapable pairing with a dUtI for successful attainment
of yoga. For such a common practitioner the kaula path, like the kula of
vilAsinI-s, is not available. The kaula practice with a dUtI is only
fruitful for the true yogin. For this yogin the dUtI truly manifests as
his shakti. The yogin who is free from disease, who is possessed with
the virility of 3 or more bulls, and who is in complete control of his
retas and unmoved by the appearance of sundarI-s will alone be easily
able to recognize a dUtI. To such a yogin the true dUtI will
automatically appear as an abhisArikA. In a dark, quite place at night,
ideally a shmashAna or a grove, he will meet her and mentally
communicate without saying anything. The success in this communication
will indicate the successful discovery of the dUtI. He will then go away
and meet her again after a while, all the while controlling his senses.
After this he is ready to rove in company of the dUtI to attain yogic
perfection.
