## LXVII

*To Mr. Francis Leggett*

\[THOUSAND ISLAND PARK, U.S.A.

*August 1895*\]

DEAR FRIEND,

I received your note duly.

Very kind of you and noble to ask me to have my own time to London. Many
thanks for that. But I am in no hurry for London and, moreover, *I want
to see you married in Paris* and then I go over to London.

I will be ready, Father Leggett, at hand and in time — never fear.

Yours affectionately ever,  
VIVEKANANDA
