## CLV

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

CHICAGO

*30 November 1899*

MY DEAR DHIRA MATA —

I am going to leave this place tonight. They have given me a new trunk —
a big one. The Maspero book[1](#fn1) is with me, only the second volume.
The first volume must be in Boston. Kindly send it c/o Joe \[Miss
Josephine MacLeod\].

They have been very kind. Madame \[Emma\] Calvé‚ came to see me day
before yesterday. She is a great woman.

I have nothing to write here except that Margo \[Sister Nivedita\] is
doing very well, except some people were complaining last night that she
frightened them with her assertion that Swami can not make mistakes!!!

Hope things are going on with you very well. This is in haste. I write
in length from California.

Ever your son,  
VIVEKANANDA

My love to Mrs. \[Olea\] Vaughn. (Mrs. Ole Bull’s daughter.)
