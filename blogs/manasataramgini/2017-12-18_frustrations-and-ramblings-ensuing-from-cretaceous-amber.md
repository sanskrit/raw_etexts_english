title = "Frustrations and ramblings ensuing from Cretaceousxa0amber"

+++
Time and again I have been frustrated by the inability of Hindus to make
the most of the riches that are available in their own land or right
next to them. One such case is that of Cretaceous amber from Myanmar,
which has recently become the focus of an enormous scientific
exploration. It is telling us about arthropod natural history like never
before: Many insect lineages were already close to their modern form by
the time window of 98.7-108 million years ago to which this amber is
dated. For example we see ants and termites were already on the rise and
had established their caste structure. This gives a firm evidence for
the enormous antiquity and resilience of the caste-structure in social
insects, thereby supporting its adaptive value. It is giving us the
first picture of the ticks that sucked dinosaur blood as well as
dermestid beetle larvae, which were probably nest symbionts that fought
these ticks with their specialized structures called hastisetae. We are
also getting the rare dinosaur chicks, which were unfortunate enough to
get sloshed in this resin and be preserved for us to understand their
anatomy in some detail. How is all this being studied? The researchers
appear to simply go to Myanmar and buy amber and study its inclusions.
However, I do not see one Hindu involved in this process despite India
having close ties to Myanmar and knowing of this resource for centuries.
This is research where the Hindus could have beaten the cīna-s and
mleccha-s by a stretch but failed to even notice the wealth in their
neighborhood.

This set off a train of thoughts that go a long way back in time. Pliny
the elder, was one of those charismatic figures in history with few
parallels – a general in both the Roman navy and land army and a
naturalist, who apparently died during the eruption of mount Vesuvius.
Of him his nephew writes:

“For my part I deem those blessed to whom, by favor of the gods, it has
been granted either to do what is worth writing of, or to write what is
worth reading; above measure blessed those on whom both gifts have been
conferred. In the latter number will be my uncle, by virtue of his own
and of your \[Tacitus of Germania fame\] composition.”

The composition his nephew is talking about is the Naturalis Historia.
This interesting work has a whole chapter on amber, and mentions the
Indian amber on three occasions. He mentions that the yavana Nicias had
noted that amber was used in place of guggulu or aguru as a high-end
incense. He also mentions that the yavana physician Ktesias, employed by
the Iranian emperor, noted that the Hindus obtained amber from a river
called Hypobarus that flowed from the north to the eastern ocean. The
river flows by a mountain where trees called “siptachorae” produce amber
and discharge it into the river. Then Pliny states that Archaelaus, a
chief of Cappadocia, brought amber from India with bark still adhering
to it and processed it to get the shiny polish. It was said to contain
ants, gnats and lizards in it by means of which Pliny inferred that
amber must have once been liquid.

These ancient Greek accounts would suggest a pre-Mauryan knowledge of
amber in India. Importantly, the river flowing into the eastern ocean
brings to mind the tributaries of the Irāvati river in Myanmar in whose
valleys amber is found. However, it does appear that the accounts might
have in part conflated real amber, i.e. the fossil resin, with more
recent resin. Nevertheless, that real amber was used as jewelry by the
Hindus is confirmed by the cīna-s, who during the great Tibet-Tang-Hindu
drama mention that the rājā of Nepal had jewels of amber.

We have often thought that the great Hindu naturalist Varāhamihira was a
kindred soul of Pliny. In his natural history, the Bṛhat-saṃhita, he has
a few chapters on gemstones. Turning to those we find a curiously named
gem called saugandhika, which literally means good-smelling. This is
consistent with Nicias account of Indian amber being used for incense.
Hence, we believe this was an old name for amber. Varāhamihira
classifies this gemstone in the padmarāga category. He says the gems of
this class are of three types in the beginning of chapter 81:

saugandhika-kuruvinda-sphaṭikebhyaḥ padmarāga-sambhūtiḥ |  
The padmarāga-s are formed from saugandhika (resin), corundum and
crystals

saugandhikajā bhramara-añjana-abja-jambūrasa-dyutayaḥ ||  
That originating from resin have the shimmer of bees, collyrium, clouds
and the rose-apple juice.

kuruvinda-bhavāḥ śabalā manda-dyutayaś ca dhātubhir viddhāḥ |  
Those originating from corundum are dappled, with a dim glow and
permeated by mineral inclusions.

sphaṭika-bhavā dyutimanto nānā-varṇā viśuddhāś ca ||  
Those originating from crystals are lustrous, with multi-colored
\[sparkle\] and clear.

There are few points of note here: One may wonder why Varāhamihira
groups these together as padmarāga-s. First, several samples of Burmese
amber can have a reddish tint (he specifically mentions jambūrasa)
placing them together with the other reddish gems he describes in this
category. Second, Burma also produces rubies and corundums, which might
have led to a geographic association between these stones; in any case
Varāhamihira does recognize their different “geological” origins.
Finally, one may wonder what the saugandhikajā’s bhramara-dyuti would
mean. Most simply take it to be bee-colored i.e. yellow and black.
However, we are tempted to see it as an acknowledgment of the insect
inclusions in amber. Varāhamihira tells us of a nāstika author
Buddhabhaṭa (“Buddha’s soldier”) who had composed treatise on gems to
which he refers the readers. May be we would have gotten more
information from that text had it come down to us. Perhaps, due to
declining scientific interests of the bauddha-s over time or the
Mohammedan book-burning this text has not survived.

The Greeks and Romans called amber elektron after its yellowish luster.
This word has give rise to the modern words like electricity and
electron. This is due to the static electricity generated in amber, i.e.
triboelectric charging, when rubbed with a woolen cloth. This property
has given rise to the second name for it in Sanskrit tṛṇamaṇi or
tṛṇagraha. This literally means the straw-gem or the straw-seizer.
This property of amber is used by the great Kashmirian kavi Kalhaṇa in a
beautiful simile, where he describes the acts of a warrior Rilhaṇa:

tat khaḍgasya ghnataḥ khaḍgāñ jīvair jālac chalād dhruvam |  
utthāya lagnaṃ śatrūṇāṃ tṛṇais tṛṇamaṇer iva ||

As his\[Rilhaṇa’s\] sword’s blows struck down their swords,  
the enemies’ lives \[were stuck firmly\] as a web \[to his sword\],  
even like straw-blades rise up to stick to amber.

This clearly indicates that not just amber but its propensity for static
electricity was well-known even in the Hindu world. Indeed, another
Kashmirian kavi Bhallaṭa also talks of the same property but his verse
indicates that by the beginning of the last century of the first
millennium of the common era amber’s value was declining in the Indian
mind. He says:

cintāmaṇes tṛṇamaṇeś ca kṛtaṃ vidhātrā  
kenobhayor api maṇitvam adaḥ samānam |  
naiko’rthitāni dadad arthijanāya khinno  
gṛhṇañ jarat-tṛṇalavaṃ tu na lajjate’nyaḥ ||

The cintāmaṇi and amber, both made by Vidhātṛ,  
now then why should the gem-hood of both \[be considered\] equal?  
One has undesired \[qualities\], giving sadness to one desiring it,  
attracting dry pieces of straw, but is not ashamed by the other.

Bhallaṭa’s anthology is filled with verses with a suggestive satire.
Here, he compares amber to the fabulous gem cintāmaṇi and says that
while both are called gems one (i.e. amber) is in reality rather
worthless compared to the other member in the same category. This verse
reminded me of the category “biologist”. While many scientists are
placed in that category the difference between actual exemplars is like
that between the cintāmaṇi and the tṛṇmaṇi of Bhallaṭa. While they sit
in high seats and publish papers in magazines considered prestigious
their knowledge and understanding of the science is shockingly abysmal.
Yet the mleccha system allows this charade to continue much in the
manner of things lumped in the gemstone category of Bhallaṭa.

However, we would say this decline of amber in the Hindu mind was not a
good thing, bringing us back to where we started this note. For a
paleontologist the Cretaceous amber, the tṛṇmaṇi of yore is indeed
nothing short of a cintāmaṇi: pariṇāmavadibhyas tṛṇamaṇiś cintāmaṇir eva
