## CLXXIX

*To Sister Nivedita*

*2nd May, 1900.*

MY DEAR NIVEDITA,

I have been very ill — one more relapse brought about by months of hard
work. Well, it has shown me that I have no kidney or heart disease
whatsoever, only overworked nerves. I am, therefore, going today in the
country for some days till I completely recover, which I am sure will be
in a few days.

In the meanwhile I do not want to read any India letters with the plague
news etc. My mail is coming to Mary; either she or you keep them (you,
if she goes away) till I return.

I am going to throw off all worry, and glory unto Mother.

Mrs. C. P. Huntington, a very, very wealthy lady, who has helped me,
came; wants to see and help you. She will be in New York by the first of
June. Do not go away without seeing her. If I cannot come early enough,
I will send you an introduction to her.

Give my love to Mary. I am leaving here in a few days.

Ever yours with blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. The accompanying letter is to introduce you to Mrs. M. C. Adams,
wife of Judge Adams. Go to see her immediately. Much good may come out
of it. She is well known; find out her address.

V.
