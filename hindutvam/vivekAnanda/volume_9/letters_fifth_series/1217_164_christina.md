## CLXIV

*To Sister Christine*

1719 TURK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,

*12th March 1900*.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

Just now received a letter from you through New York. I, the other day,
wrote you one c/o Mrs. Funke, as I was not sure which of your addresses
in my notebook was the correct one! Mental telepathy or foolishness —
what is it?

By this time you must have got mine. There is nothing particular about
me, except things are going on at the same rate — very little money —
making, a good deal of work, and moving about. I leave here in April and
come to Chicago for a few days, then to Detroit and then, through New
York, go to England. I hope you are all right. I am very calm and
peaceful mentally, and hope to remain so for the rest of my life.

How are Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\] and the rest of our friends?

With all love,  
VIVEKANANDA.
