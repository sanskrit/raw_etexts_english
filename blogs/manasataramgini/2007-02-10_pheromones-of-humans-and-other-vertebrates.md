1\) 2-methylbut-2-enal: The rabbit milk pheromone. Induced nipple search
behavior of pups and directs them towards the nipples of the mother.
Given that rabbits feed their young only once a day this behavior is
critical for survival.  
2\) (methylthio)methanethiol: Mouse male pheromone. A molecule with a
strong garlic-like odor that attracts females towards the male by
inducing an investigative behavior.  
3\) androstadienone: Human male pheromone. A molecule with a mild musky
odor causes physiological arousal in females by inducing increased heart
beat, blood pressure and breathing rate, and feeling of improved mood.  
4\) 5a-androst-16-en-3-ol: The boar pheromone. Causes sows to raise
their posterior and display a receptive posture.  
5\) petromyzonamine disulfate: the lamprey migratory pheromone. It is
released by larval lamprey in streams and guides sexually mature
parasitic adults to swim towards the spawning stream.  
6\) 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone: A mouse male pheromone. Accelerates
puberty of pre-pubertal females.  
7\) (S)-2-sec-butyl-4.5-dihydrothiazole: Multi-faceted mouse male
pheromone  
8\) (RR)-3.4-dehydroexo-brevicomin: Multi-faceted mouse male pheromone.
This and the above compound induce aggression when smelt by other males.
When smelt by pre-pubertal females they cause acceleration of puberty
and when sensed by adult females induce and synchronize the estrus
cycles.

I have always strongly believed in the existence of human pheromones,
emitted by both males and females. Critics have felt that the
degeneration of the vomeronasal organ and loss of the TRPC2 channel in
humans might mean that there is no pheromonal signaling. However, I have
always held that the regular olfactory mucosa is likely to be a
sufficient interface for pheromone sensing. For a while it had been
suspected that androstadienone, a testosterone derivative emitted by
male via their skin is the primary male pheromone. A recent study by
Wyart et al building on earlier work of Savic et al brings considerable
support to this and suggests that it indeed induces behavioral changes
in females. One important point they note is that the intensity of smell
does not correlate with magnitude of action of the pheromone. So it
appears to work in a sense “sub-consciously”- i.e. there is no
connection with the odor experience. This seems to be an important point
in support of it being a pheromone. Based on the experience of males
including my own suggest I have long come to hold that females exude a
pheromone that activates responses in males. From the study of Savic et
al this appears to be estra-1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (not pictured
above). I suspect that while active olfaction is required to detect it,
its actions occur again somewhat “subconsciously”.
