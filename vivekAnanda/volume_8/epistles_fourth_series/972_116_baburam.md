## CXVI

(*Translated from [Bengali](b8388e8116.pdf)* )

*To Swami Premananda*

DEHRA DUN,  
*24th November, 1897*.

MY DEAR BABURAM,

I got all news about you from Hariprasanna. I am especially pleased to
hear that Rakhal and Hari are now quite well.

Now Babu Raghunath Bhattacharya of Tehri is suffering very much from
some pain in the neck; I also have been suffering for a long time from
some pain at the back of my neck. If you can get hold of some very old
ghee, then send some of it to him at Dehra Dun and some of it to me also
at my Khetri address. You are sure to get it from Habu or Sharat
(lawyer). Address it to Babu Raghunath Bhattacharya, Dehra Dun, N.W.P. .
. . and it will reach him.

The day after tomorrow I am leaving for Saharanpur; from there to
Rajputana.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS. My love to all.

V.
