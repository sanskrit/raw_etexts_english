The old woman’s shoulders  
were dry, unfleshed,  
with outstanding veins;  
her low belly  
was like a lily pad.

When people said  
her son had taken fright,  
had turned his back on battle  
and died,

she raged  
and shouted,  
” If he really broke down  
in the thick of strife,  
I’ll slash these breasts  
that gave him suck,”

and went there  
sword in hand.

Turning over body after fallen body,  
she rummaged through the blood-red field  
till she found her son,  
cut, in four pieces,

and she rejoiced  
more than on the day  
she gave him birth.

Old tamil society was a heroic and gory one, full of cattle raids
leading to skirmishes and full fledged battles. They were fought with
spears, arrows and swords with no ritual show, but plain ferocity.

Poetess auvaiyAr sings of the fall of her patron, a tamil war lord
atiyamAn neDumAn a\~Nchi:  
“Pointing at the enemy  
the tongues of lances,  
new-forged and whetted,  
urging soldiers forward  
with himself at the head,  
in a skirmish of arrows and spears,  
cleaving though an oncoming wave of foes,  
forcing a clearing,  
he had fallen  
in that space  
between the armies,  
his body hacked to pieces.”

auvaiyAr singing on her dead warlord adiyamAn neDumAn Anchi

“He gave us  
all the flesh  
on the bones.  
where is he now?

wherever spear and arrow flew,  
he was there.  
where is he now?

with his hands scented  
with lemon grass,  
he caressed my hair  
smelling of meat.  
where is he now?  
The vEl that pierced his chest  
pierced at once  
the wide eating bowls  
of great and famous minstrels,

and, dimming the images in the eyes  
of men he sheltered,  
it went right through the subtle tongues  
of poets  
skilled in the search  
for good words.

Where is he now?
