Phase shifted by an year we were there forced to spend time with the
wild Northerners, more precisely characterized as the fallen brahmins
and kShatriyas. Luckily for us we had our own inner circle with whom we
could explore the further mysteries of whippos and the secret
applications. We remained there like a pAshupata verily, concealing the
brahman, observing the unmatta of others, behaving like a vR^ikSha
ourselves. The secret formula goes as badhira Akrandayati.

We returned and saw two kR^ityAs. One was headed for the yonder man. The
other was headed for us. Jx had left the land, the kR^ityA moving away
from him came over to us.
