title = "Brief Notification Of Reduced Attention For A Bit â€“ But The Work Still Goesxa0On!"
date = "July 15, 2021"

Iâ€™m back to university as of this week, and the course difficultyâ€™s
ratcheted up â€“ so Iâ€™ll have considerably less time to devote to our work
though Arya Akasha for a bit.  
  
Rather than just â€˜going darkâ€™ completely, Iâ€™ll endeavour to explore
other ways to keep the flow of information & insight open.  
  
These may include posting answers to questions people have messaged to
ask which may prove of general interest as shorter-form pieces; or, for
that matter, doing another (and this time semi-regular) Q&A thread.  
  
Interested in ideas, thoughts and comments. Unenthused about having to
take time off from giving Arya Akasha the large share of my energy and
attention (and you guys donâ€™t even see most of the effort, because much
of the research-work and person-to-person comms donâ€™t translate into
published pieces ðŸ˜› ), but committed to seeing it through.
