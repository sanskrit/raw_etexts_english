## XXXIII

19 W., 38 ST.,  
NEW YORK, *1895*.

DEAR ALASINGA,

. . . Meddle not with so-called social reform, for there cannot be any
reform without spiritual reform first. Who told you that I want social
reform? Not I. Preach the Lord — say neither good nor bad about the
superstitions and diets. Do not lose heart, do not lose faith in your
Guru, do not lose faith in God. So long as you possess these three,
nothing can harm you, my child. I am growing stronger every day. Work
on, my brave boys.

Ever yours with blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
