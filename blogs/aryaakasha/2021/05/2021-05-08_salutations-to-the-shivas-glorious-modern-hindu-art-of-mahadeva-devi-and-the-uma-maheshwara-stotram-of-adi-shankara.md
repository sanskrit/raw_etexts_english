Beautiful art of Lord Shiva & Devi, by Tanushree Ghosh

Goes rather nicely with Adi Shankara’s Uma Maheshwara Hymnal:

नमः शिवाभ्यां नवयौवनाभ्यां  
परस्पराश्लिष्टवपुर्धराभ्याम् ।  
नगेन्द्रकन्यावृषकेतनाभ्यां  
नमो नमः शङ्करपार्वतीभ्याम् ॥ 1 ॥

Salutations to Lord Shiva and Goddess Shiva,  
Who are always in a fresh stage of youth,  
Who cling to each other in a tight embrace,  
Of whom one is the daughter of the mountain,  
And the other is one whose symbol is a bull,  
Salutations and salutations to Lord Sankara  
And to that Goddess Parvathy. \|\| 1 \|\|

And to that Goddess Parvathy. \|\| 2 \|\|

to check its evocation\]

Jai Ardhanarishvara ❤  
  
—  
  
Addendum:  
  

Also, somebody just asked me –  
  
“So is it Goddess Shiva or Goddess Shiva-a”  
  
To answer –  
  
“Yes.”  
  
To answer somewhat more illuminatingly, perhaps –  
  
Like, what’s going on here is that शिवाभ्यां is the dative *dual* case
of “Shiva”  
  
so it’s “To Shivas” – with the implicit understanding, it would appear,
that it is to *both* Shivas … that is to say both parts to the
Ardhanarishvara Whole.  
  
Like, it’s an interesting shorthand for .. what’s said in the last two
lines of each verse – wherein the hailing is to both Shiva and Parvati ,
identified more individually.  
  
Each of the verses – the descriptive elements that are the body of them,
you *could* read as referring to *either* Shiva *or* Devi if you wanted
to … it would still somewhat fit. I mean, Shiva rides Nandi, yes – but
there are also Aspects of Devi Who similarly ride a Bull as vahana; to
take one example.  
  
Except the delightful complexity and intricacy of this Hymnal is that we
see … it is the married couple Who are so strongly coterminous that
really, it is about as accurate to hail Them as the same Being.  
  
We see what we *think* is ‘one’ under the heading of Shiva .. and we
find that it is actually Shiva in the dual – Shivas .. .and then we find
that in fact, it is Shiva and Parvati … and that this has been ‘hidden’
in plain sight all the while, with each verse. Which then re-unifies
again with this enhanced understanding.  
  
Beautiful !  
  

And, to continue my answer to the gentleman –  
  
Although there is also , as you know, a frequent occurrence of referring
to matched pairings of Gods and Goddesses via masculine and feminine
forms of the same noun/theonym.  
  
Rudra & Rudrani , for instance – or Kaal and Kali .. but then, of
course, I repeat myself.  
  
However, while it *is* true that “Shivaa” would be a feminine form of
“Shiva” *as an adjective*, I am not actually sure that there exists such
a thing as a noun. \[there is a neuter gender for ‘Shiva’ as a noun as
well, though\]  
  
Instead, “Shivani’ would probably be how one would say ‘Shiva’ in female
noun formulation.  
  
But that is not what the versesmith has done here – instead, he has gone
for a much more eloquent (in my opinion, anyway) and succinctly subtle
phrasing:  
  
instead of “Shiva & Shivani” … we simply have “Shiva” , with the “Shiva”
in question being *dual* yet also, by the very fact that this is a
single word .. *one*.
