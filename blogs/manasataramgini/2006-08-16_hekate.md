Another point I shall consider is the role of the great goddess Hekate
in Neoplatonic thought. Hekate in Neoplatonism plays a strikingly
parallel role to mAyA in uttaramImAMsa and prakR^iti in sAMkhya. She is
described in the Chaldaean oracles to have emerged from the “primary
entity/being” (the Neoplatonic equivalent of puruSha or brahman) and
separates the two “fires”- the “purely intellectual fire” that belongs
to the primary entity/being and the material fire from which the cosmos
arises. She separated the two fires in the form of a membrane (again
parallel to the mAyA of uttaramImAMsa). The universe is seen as her
emanation. In iconography she is seen as three-headed and the mistress
of the 3 paths and may be compared to the goddess tripurA of shrIvidyA.
An old orphic hymn to her is of considerable interest (the original
Greek text is provided along with an adaptation of the translation by
Adam Forrest; we note a few words in the Greek text for comparison with
saMskR^itaM)
