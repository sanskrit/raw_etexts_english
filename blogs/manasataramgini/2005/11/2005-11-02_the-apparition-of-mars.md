title = "The apparition of Mars"

+++
We have been observing Mars since October 30th. We have had the most
spectacular views of the planet ever in our whole observing career. At
magnitude below -2.1 it stole the show in the whole observing session.
We also got a good view of sanaishchara with its elegant rings.
