title = "Constructing a regular heptagon with hyperbola and parabola"

+++
There is little doubt that Archimedes was one of the greatest yavana
intellectuals. He would also figure in any list of the greatest
mathematician-scientists of all times. His work on the construction of a
regular heptagon has not survived the destruction of yavana works by the
pretasādhaka-s. However, the Platonist heathen of Harran, [Thabit ibn
Kurra](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/08/28/the-makings-of-islamic-science/),
preserves Archimedes conclusion that to construct a heptagon one needs
to trisect an angle. This can be achieved using yavana techniques by say
the conchoid of Nicomedes, [as we had shown
previously](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/iamblichus-quadratures-trisections-and-the-lacuna-of-the-cycloid/).

In 1798 CE, long after the yavana-s were gone, the 21-year old Carl
Gauss wrote his famed work the Disquisitiones arithmeticae in Latin,
which showed that geometric constructions way beyond what the yavana-s
of even the order of Archimedes and Apollonius had achieved existed. The
famous construction of the 17-gon of with just a compass and
straight-edge is one of those Gaussian conquests which shows why there
is Gauss and there are the rest. Additionally, Gauss provides the
general principles which can be used for conic constructions of other
polygons. We present below the construction of the regular heptagon
using these Gaussian principles in lay terms. The constructions assumes
you can draw conics given certain necessary and sufficient prerequisites
as we have earlier demonstrated on these pages.

1\) Draw a circle with center O in side which the heptagon will be
drawn.  
2\) Draw the horizontal and vertical diameters. The former meets the
circle at points A and B.  
3\) Bisect the angle formed by the two diameters to get points C and D
on the circle.  
4\) Mark points H and I at distance half the radius of the circle from
its center O.  
5\) Draw perpendiculars at H and I to the horizontal and vertical
diameters respectively so that they meet at point J.  
6\) Using point J as the vertex and points C and D as foci draw a
rectangular hyperbola (colored brown).  
7\) Mark point K at distant half the radius of the circle from center O
and draw a line parallel to the horizontal diameter through K. Draw
tangent to the circle at point B. The two meet at point E.  
8\) Using point E as center mark points F and G on
![\\overleftrightarrow{EK}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BEK%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{EK}") using a circle with radius
![\\frac{1}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\frac{1}{8}")th of the starting circle.  
9\) Draw a vertical line through G. Use it as the directrix and F as the
focus to draw a parabola with vertex at point E.  
9\) Mark the three points of intersection of the hyperbola and parabola
which have been thus constructed.  
10\) Draw vertical lines through these three points to cut the starting
circle at 6 points. These points together with A are the vertices of the
desired heptagon.

The Gaussian principle behind this can be derived as below. Consider the
following,  
The unit circle:
![x^2+y^2=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2%2By%5E2%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x^2+y^2=1")

The rectangular hyperbola:
![xy=\\frac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=xy%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"xy=\\frac{1}{4}")

The parabola:
![x=2y^2+2y-\\frac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D2y%5E2%2B2y-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x=2y^2+2y-\\frac{1}{2}")

Solve the equations of the hyperbola and parabola simultaneously. Since
the substitution results in a cubic with 3 real roots we get 3 points:  
(-0.2225209,-1.1234898); (0.6234898; 0.4009689); (-0.9009689,
-0.2774791)  
The vertical line passing through these 3 points will cut the above unit
circle at 6 points which correspond to the 6 complex roots of the
equation
![z^7=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%5E7%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z^7=1"). The real root will be point (1,0), i.e. corresponding to point
A in our construction.

The “seveness” of the three points obtained by the intersection of the
parabola and hyperbola is seen in the coordinates of the points which
can be represented as:

![(\\frac{1}{2(1-S)},
\\frac{1-S}{2})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%281-S%29%7D%2C+%5Cfrac%7B1-S%7D%7B2%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\frac{1}{2(1-S)}, \\frac{1-S}{2})")

![(\\frac{S-2}{2},
\\frac{1}{2(S-2)})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cfrac%7BS-2%7D%7B2%7D%2C+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%28S-2%29%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(\\frac{S-2}{2}, \\frac{1}{2(S-2)})")

![(-\\frac{\\sqrt{S}}{2},-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{S}})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28-%5Cfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7BS%7D%7D%7B2%7D%2C-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Csqrt%7BS%7D%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(-\\frac{\\sqrt{S}}{2},-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{S}})")

Where the silver constant is
![S=2+2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%3D2%2B2%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"S=2+2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)"); note
![\\frac{2\\pi}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\frac{2\\pi}{7}") is the heptagon angle.

I recently learned of an interesting expression for the silver constant
apparently discovered by T.Piezas of the form,

![k=\\sqrt\[3\]{7+7\\sqrt\[3\]{7+7\\sqrt\[3\]{7+...}}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B7%2B7%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B7%2B7%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B7%2B...%7D%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k=\\sqrt[3]{7+7\\sqrt[3]{7+7\\sqrt[3]{7+...}}}")

![S=2+\\frac{k+2}{k+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%3D2%2B%5Cfrac%7Bk%2B2%7D%7Bk%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"S=2+\\frac{k+2}{k+1}")

It also relates to a peculiar number discovered by Srinivasa Ramanujan
that brings three of these heptagon angles together:

![\\sqrt\[3\]{\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)}+\\sqrt\[3\]{\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{7}\\right)}+\\sqrt\[3\]{\\cos\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\right)}=\\sqrt\[3\]{\\frac{5-3\\sqrt\[3\]{7}}{2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%7D%2B%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B4%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%7D%2B%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B6%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%7D%3D%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B%5Cfrac%7B5-3%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B7%7D%7D%7B2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt[3]{\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)}+\\sqrt[3]{\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{7}\\right)}+\\sqrt[3]{\\cos\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\right)}=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{5-3\\sqrt[3]{7}}{2}}")

More trivially,

![\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)+\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{7}\\right)+\\cos\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\right)=-\\frac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B4%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B6%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%3D-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)+\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{7}\\right)+\\cos\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\right)=-\\frac{1}{2}")

and,

![\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)\\cdot\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{7}\\right)\\cdot\\cos\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\right)=\\frac{1}{8}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%5Ccdot%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B4%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%5Ccdot%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B6%5Cpi%7D%7B7%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)\\cdot\\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{7}\\right)\\cdot\\cos\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\right)=\\frac{1}{8}")
