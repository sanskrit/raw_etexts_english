title = "The oldest surviving planetary ritual of the Hindus"

+++
Certain white Indologists and their Japanese imitators have often held
the dishonest view that Hindus were unaware of planets until the
yavana-s informed them of their existence in the sky. This view was
demolished by the great patriot of the Hindu nation Lokamanya Tilak
about a century ago. In fact he showed that the proto-Indo-Europeans
(leaving out the Hittites) certainly knew of the brightest planet in the
sky. Of course this is encoded in the form the venas recitation with the
shukra and manthin graha-s. But a question still remains: Does any
relatively early vedic rite specifically directed at the planets exist
and survive. One example of this graheShTi of the kaTha yajurvedin-s:

The above ritual is of interest because it provides an important link in
the evolution of planet related rituals in the vedic system. To
understand this we have to look a little more into the worship of
astronomical entities in vedic rites. In the R^igveda we do not have any
sUkta dedicated to the nakShatra-s. However, in the taittirIya brAhmaNa
we have a long new sUkta composed for the purpose of the nakShatreShTi.
Comparable sUkta-s were composed in the atharvanic tradition, whereas
the kaTha-s merely culled mantra-s from the saMhitA to create the
liturgical recitations for their nakShatreShTi ritual (as we have seen
before on these pages). An important point to note is that these
nakShatra rituals begin with kR^ittikA at the spring equinox. However,
from Tilak’s studies, and from other related lines of evidence, we can
see that the core of the RV was not associated with the kR^ittikA-s, but
with earlier asterisms of rohiNI or mR^igashIrSha. Hence, it does appear
that the nakShatra liturgy was an innovation of the kR^ittikA period.
However, the structure of the soma ritual suggests that there was an
earlier nakShatra recitation in the consecration of the pebbles of the
asterisms in laying the fifth layer of brick of the chiti. Since the
recitations for this act are found in the YV and again begin with
kR^ittikA one could argue that this and perhaps a good part of the chiti
recitations were post-RV compositions of the adhvaryava tradition of the
YV. None of this indicates that the nakShatra system came into being de
novo in the core YV period. We do have the Iranian list of 28
nakShatra-s that was originally used, before being supplanted by the
zodiacal system, probably after the Iranians moved into the Middle East.
While the complete Iranian nakShatra list only survives in the Pahlavi
bundahishn, we have some avestan names supporting their old origins.
Further we can reconstruct that at least some of the names of asterisms
probably predated the Indo-Iranian split. Thus, based on this we can
infer the following: 1) There was a nakShatra list predating the
Indo-Iranian divergence. 2) Both in the core RV and Avesta period there
was no dedicated ritual to the nakShatra-s. However, they were
collectively or by specific names referred to within recitations in this
period. 3) In the beginnings of the elaborate shrauta ritual of the agni
chiti-s they were incorporated into the ritual of laying of pebbles. 4)
In the core YV/later AV period full-fledged rituals dedicated to the
deities in conjunction with their associated nakShatra-s emerged. 5) In
parallel, the Iranians developed later liturgy for specific asterisms
(perhaps as euphemisms for the deities associated with them, because the
deities themselves were demonized by zarathuShTra). We see these
developments as internal to the Indo-Iranian world. At least in the
Indo-Aryan world the development was largely a consequence of the
increasing calenderical emphasis in the shrauta ritual.

Understanding this evolution of the nakShatra rituals is important
because the case of the planets in Indo-Aryan rituals is similar in many
ways though the details might differ. Firstly, unlike the nakShatra-s at
least two planets had dedicated sUkta-s to them in the older saMhitA
collections. The most well-known of these are the sUkta-s to vena in the
RV (10.123) and AV (vulgate 2.1) and that to both vena and bR^ihaspati
in AV (vulgate 4.1). While bR^ihaspati has additional non-planetary
dimensions and is a central deity in several rituals, vena appears to be
a purely invoked in specific ritual actions. For example the primary use
of the vena sUkta from the RV was in the deployment of the shukra and
manthin soma cups in the somayAga. As per AV tradition vena is invoked
in the upavastha rite, the gharma recitation in the atharvanic
pravargya, and the laying down of the gold biscuit in the agnichayana
ritual. In the longer gharma recitation given in the AV-paippalAda
saMhitA (AV-P 16.150) we take the word graha to mean planet as it occurs
with terms like shukra and pa\~nchAre chakra in the same sUkta. Two
sAman-s to shukra/vena are deployed during the piling of the altar
during the agnichayana. In a royal atharvavedic ritual of leading the
king to his palace a recitation is deployed which invokes the planets as
a group along with rAhu and the ketu-s (AV-vulgate 19.9). Even though
there might have been early sUkta-s dedicated to at least two planets,
it should be noted that their primary original role was, as with the
nakShatra-s, in special actions in the shrauta rituals. Thus, neither
nakShatra-s nor planets had a dedicated ritual in the earliest layers,
but they were certainly known and referred to in ritual contexts.

However, in the case of graha-s we see a profusion of rituals appearing
the late vedic period as a part of the terminal sections of the gR^ihya
texts. Examples of these include the jaiminIya gR^ihyasUtra 2.9;
vaikhAnasa gR^ihyasUtra grahashAnti of 1.4.13; and the shanti-kalpa of
the atharvan-s; graha homa of the kaTha-s usually appended after the
graheShTi as a gR^ihya rite; the bodhAyanIya gR^ihya-sheSha sUtra 1.6.
Their late character is established by the nature of the ritual, which
often has elements of the smArta sarvopachAra pUja and use of images
made of wood or metal or drawings of the planetary archons. They sudden
appearance across the gR^ihya texts as late sections lent fuel to the
indological assertion that they were Babylonian or Greek imports that
were brought into the Indic world along with Greek/Babylonian astrology
and weekdays. However, the kaTha brAhmaNa and mantra-s with distinct
names of the planets and also older ritual structure suggests that what
ever the role of the Middle Eastern influence, the graha rituals
certainly had an endogenous element.Importantly, it shows that just as
in the case of the nakShatra-s the dedicated shrauta ritual to the
planets arose as a part of the new set of shrauta performances that were
instituted during the compilation of the yajur collections. Thus the
planetary and nakShatra rites follow the same pattern – their mantra-s
had an early role as accessories rather than as deities in the early
shrauta ritual, but the in the late shrauta ritual they might receive
full-fledged rites.

Finally, we must note that the names of the planets are some what
atypical in the kaTha ritual and appear to represent the older form of
their names. The name arka for Mars is intriguing. It should be noted
that this name is often used for the sun, but clearly in this case it
means Mars and not the sun. The word arka is also used for Mars in the
bodhAyanIya gR^ihyasheSha sUtra-s. This raises the possibility that
indeed other usages of arka in the shruti could also signify Mars rather
than the sun. Indeed, I suspect that this is the case in certain RV
mantra-s. Most likely candidates are the references found in the sUkta-s
to bR^ihaspati in the maNDala 10 by the R^iShi ayAsya A\~ngirasa. In
RV10.67.5 we encounter:  
vibhidyA puraM shayAthem apAchIM nis trINi sAkam udadher akR^intat |  
bR^ihaspatir uShasaM sUryaM gAm arkaM viveda stanayann iva dyauH ||  
Here bR^ihapati is described as splitting the fort and the “sleeping
places” in the west (of vala) as he cut off three joints of the “water
holder”. Doing this and roaring like dyaus bR^ihaspati “discovered”
(viveda) the uShA-s, sUrya, the cows and arka. While this R^ik is
extremely obscure in terms of its cryptic allusions there are several
motifs that clearly indicate it as concealing an astronomical picture.
Further, the bR^ihaspati of this sUkta does have a strong astronomical
dimension as the planetary deity. In any case the point of importance to
us in this context is that it clearly distinguish arka from sUrya, thus
indicating that arka is not the sun, but could be Mars, who is named
thus in the graheShTi. This gets further support in a R^ik in the
subsequent sUkta also to bR^ihaspati:  
ApruShAyan madhuna R^itasya yonim avakShipann arka ulkAm iva dyoH |  
bR^ihaspatir uddharann ashmano gA bhUmyA udneva vitvachaM bibheda ||  
While there are obscure elements in this R^ik too, it is said that
bR^ihaspati drew out the cows from the rock and split the earth like the
skin of a cloud even as arka hurled down a meteor and showered the
source of the R^ita with honey. This meteor fall refers to the night sky
and not the day sky of the sun supporting the identification of arka in
this context as Mars.
