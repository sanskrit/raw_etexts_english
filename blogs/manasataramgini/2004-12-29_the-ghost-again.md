It was disastrous day. Unfazed by the disasters we were returning. We
paused on our path for we distinctly saw some strange dark object like a
coat lying on our a path a few feet away. I reached the object somehow
drawn by curiousity to examine it. Just before I reached it I was
distracted for a moment as I looked to the side due to a scrapping
noise. I turned back and the black object was gone\! Where it lay I say
some ungainly stains like smeared flesh or blood of a dead animal. I
heard the scrapping noise again and there was just no sign of the black
object that I had clearly seen.

ST had wished for me : “You will go up the mountain. On your way back as
you are rushing back you will get stuck and will not be able to come
down.”
