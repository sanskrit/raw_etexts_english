title = "French wine: practical symbolism?"

+++
Malhotra had once mentioned in his blog that French wine may be a major
cultural symbol. This reminded me of a peculiar incident that indeed
does support this contention in a twisted way- the tale of how French
wines mediated in a civilizational clash. …Raghuji Bhosle at the head of
a major Maharatta force had routed Chand Sahib, a freebooter in Tamil
Nad, and besieged Pondicherry and asked the French to capitulate. The
French declared that they were friends of the Maharattas and sent Bhosle
10 bottles of some vintage French brew with the innocent name “Nantes
Cordials”. Not knowing it to be a forbidden beverage Bhosle passed the
bottles over to his wife who took a profound liking for it and asked
Bhosle to make peace with the Francisi in exchange for more bottles. The
French happily obliged a good stock of **Nantes Cordials** and Raghuji
got to confirm his wife’s opinion on the brew and promptly withdrew the
Maharatta army\!…Thus, the it is claimed that the vineyards of France
was a savior in adversity. I would not be surprised if this token of
decadent French tastes serves as a potent symbol of their culture to
those who can appreciate it….There have also been claims by other
regarding the role of French wine in staving of a Mongol invasion at the
height of Mangku’s power. But this incident remains unconfirmed, unlike
the reliable evidence favoring the Raghuji incident
