## CHAPTER VII.

PRONOUNS.

490\. The pronouns differ from the great mass of nouns and adjectives
chiefly in that they come by derivation from another and a very limited
set of roots, the so-called pronominal or demonstrative roots. But they
have also many and marked peculiarities of inflection — some of which,
however, find analogies in a few adjectives; and such adjectives will
accordingly be described at the end of this chapter.

Personal Pronouns.

491\. The pronouns of the first and second persons are the most
irregular and peculiar of all, being made up of fragments coming from
various roots and combinations of roots. They have no distinction of
gender. 

a\. Their inflection in the later language is as follows:

Singular:

1st pers.

2d pers.

N.

अहम्  
`ahám`

त्वम्  
`tvám`

A.

माम्, मा  
`mā́m`, `mā`

त्वाम्, त्वा  
`tvā́m`, `tvā`

I.

मया  
`máyā`

त्वया  
`tváyā`

D.

मह्यम्, मे  
`máhyam`, `me`

तुभ्यम्, ते  
`túbhyam`, `te`

Ab.

मत्  
`mát`

त्वत्  
`tvát`

G.

`máma`, `me`

तव, ते  
`táva`, `te`

L.

`āvā́bhyām`

युवाभ्याम्  
`yuvā́bhyām`

G. L.

आवयोस्  
`āváyos`

युवयोस्  
`yuváyos`

and A. D. G.

नौ  
`nāu`

वाम्  
`vām`

Plural:

N.

वयम्  
`vayám`

यूयम्  
`yūyám`

A.

अस्मान्, नस्  
`asmā́n`, `nas`

युष्मान्, वस्  
`yuṣmā́n`, `vas`

I.

अस्माभिस्  
`asmā́bhis`

युष्माभिस्  
`yuṣmā́bhis`

D.

अस्मभ्यम्, नस्  
`asmábhyam`, `nas`

युष्मभ्यम्, वस्  
`yuṣmábhyam`, `vas` 

Ab.

अस्मत्  
`asmát`

युष्मत्  
`yuṣmát`

G.

अस्माकम्, नस्  
`asmā́kam`, `nas`

युष्माकम्, वस्  
`yuṣmā́kam`, `vas`

L.

अस्मासु  
`asmāsu`

युष्मासु  
`yuṣmāsu`

b\. The briefer second forms for accus., dat., and gen., in all numbers,
are accentless; and hence they are not allowed to stand at the beginning
of a sentence, or elsewhere where any emphasis is laid.

c\. But they may be qualified by accented adjuncts, as adjectives: e. g.
`te jáyataḥ` *of thee when a conqueror*, `vo vṛtā́bhyaḥ` *for you that
were confined*, `nas tribhyáḥ` *to us three* (all RV.).

d\. The ablative `mat` is accentless in one or two AV. passages.

492\. Forms of the older language. All the forms given above are found
also in the older language; which, however, has also others that
afterward disappear from use.

a\. Thus, we find a few times the instr. sing. `tvā́` (only RV.: like
`manīṣā́` for `manīṣáyā`); further, the loc. or dat. sing. `mé` (only
VS.) and `tvé`, and the dat. or loc. pl. `asmé` (which is by far the
commonest of these `e`-forms) and `yuṣmé`: their final `e` is
uncombinable (or `pragṛhya`: 138 b). The VS. makes twice the acc. pl.
fem. `yuṣmā́s` (as if `yuṣmā́n` were too distinctively a masculine form).
The datives in `bhyam` are in a number of cases written, and in yet
others to be read as if written, with `bhya`, with loss of the final
nasal; and in a rare instance or two we have in like manner `asmā́ka` and
`yuṣmā́ka` in the gen. plural. The usual resolutions of semivowel to
vowel are made, and are especially frequent in the forms of the second
person (`tuám` for `tvám` etc.).

b\. But the duals, above all, wear a very different aspect earlier. In
Veda and `Brāhmaṇa` and `Sūtra` the nominatives are (with occasional
exceptions) āvám and yuvám, and only the accusatives `āvā́m` and `yuvā́m`
(but in RV. the dual forms of 1st pers. chance not to occur, unless in
`vā́m`\[?\], once, for `āvám`); the instr. in RV. is either `yuvábhyām`
(occurs also once in AÇS.) or `yuvā́bhyām`; an abl. `yuvát` appears once
in RV., and `āvát` twice in TS.; the gen.-loc. is in RV. (only) `yuvós`
instead of `yuváyos`. Thus we have here a distinction (elsewhere
unknown) of five different dual cases, by endings in part accordant with
those of the other two numbers.

493\. Peculiar endings. The ending `am`, appearing in the nom. sing. and
pl. (and Vedic du.) of these pronouns, will be found often, though only
in sing., among the other pronouns. The `bhyam` (or `hyam`) of dat.
sing. and pl. is met with only here; its relationship with the
`bhyām, bhyas, bhis` of the ordinary declension is palpable. The `t` (or
d) of the abl., though here preceded by a short vowel, is doubtless the
same with that of the `a`-declension of nouns and adjectives. That the
nom., dat., and abl. endings should be the same in sing. and pl. (and in
part in the earlier du. also), only the stem to which they are added
being different, is unparalleled elsewhere in the language. The element
`sma` appearing in the plural forms will be found frequent in the
inflection of the singular in other pronominal words: in fact, the
compound stem `asma` which underlies the plural of `aham` seems to be
the same that furnishes part of the singular forms of `ayam` (501), and
its value of *we* to be a specialisation of the meaning *these persons*.
The genitives singular, `máma` and `táva`, have no analogies elsewhere;
the derivation from them of the adjectives `māmaka` and `tāvaka` (below,
516 a) suggests the possibility of their being themselves stereotyped
stems. The gen. pl., `asmā́kam` and `yuṣmā́kam`, are certainly of this
character: namely, neuter sing. case-forms of the adjective stems
`asmāka` and `yuṣmāka`, other cases of which are found in the Veda.

494\. Stem-forms. To the Hindu grammarians, the stems of the personal
pronouns are `mad` and `asmad`, and `tvad` and `yuṣmad`, because these
are forms used to a certain extent, and allowed to be indefinitely used,
in derivation and composition (like `tad`, `kad`, etc.: see below, under
the other pronouns). Words are thus formed from them even in the older
language — namely, `mátkṛta` and `mátsakhi` and `asmátsakhi` (RV.),
`tvádyoni` and `mattás` (AV.), `tvátpitṛ` and `tvádvivācana` (TS.),
`tvátprasūta` and `tvaddevatyà` and `yuvaddevatyà` and `yuṣmaddevatyà`
(ÇB.), `asmaddevatya` (PB.); but much more numerous are those that show
the proper stem in `a`, or with the `a` lengthened to `ā`: thus,
`mā́vant`; `asmatrā́`, `asmadrúh`, etc.; `tváyata`, `tvā́vant`, `tvā́datta`,
`tvāníd`, `tvā́vasu`, `tvā́hata`, etc.; `yuṣmā́datta`, `yuṣméṣita`, etc.;
`yuvā́vant`, `yuvā́ku`, `yuvádhita`, `yuvā́datta`, `yuvā́nīta`, etc. And the
later language also has a few words made in the same way, as `mādṛç`.

a\. The Vedas have certain more irregular combinations, with complete
forms: thus, `tvā́ṁkāma`, `tvāmāhuti`, `māmpaçyá`, `mamasatyá`,
`asméhiti`, `ahampūrvá`, `ahamuttará`, `ahaṁyú`, `ahaṁsana`.

b\. From the stems of the grammarians come also the derivative
adjectives `madī́ya`, `tvadī́ya`, `asmadī́ya` `yuṣmadī́ya`, having a
possessive value: see below, 516.

c\. For `sva` and `svayám`, see below, 513.

Demonstrative Pronouns.

495\. The simplest demonstrative, त `ta`, which answers also the purpose
of a personal pronoun of the third person, may be taken as model of a
mode of declension usual in so many pronouns and pronominal adjectives
that it is fairly to be called the general pronominal declension.

a\. But this root has also the special irregularity that in the nom.
sing. masc. and fem. it has `sás` (for whose peculiar euphonic treatment
see 176 a,b) and `sā`, instead of `tás` and `tā́` (compare Gr. *ὁ, ἡ,
το*, and Goth. *sa, so, thata*). Thus:

Singular:

m\.

n\.

f\.

N.

सस्  
`sás`

तत्  
`tát`

सा  
`sa`̄́

A.

तम्

ताम्  
`tā́m`

I.

तेन  
`téna`

तया  
`táyā`

D.

तस्मै  
`tásmāi`

तस्यै  
`tásyāi`

Ab.

तस्मात्  
`tásmāt`

तस्यास्  
`tásyās`

G.

तस्य  
`tásya`

तस्यास्

तेषाम्  
`téṣām`

तासाम्  
`tā́sām`

L.

तेषु  
`téṣu`

तासु  
`tā́su`

b\. The Vedas show no other irregularities of inflection than those
which belong to all stems in `a` and `ā`: namely, `ténā` sometimes;
usually `tā́` for `tāú`, du.; often `tā́` for `tā́ni`, pl. neut.; usually
`tébhis` for `tāís`, instr. pl.; and the ordinary resolutions. The RV.
has one more case-form from the root `sa`, namely `sásmin` (occurring
nearly half as often as `tásmin`); and ChU. has once `sasmāt`.

496\. The peculiarities of the general pronominal declension, it will be
noticed, are these:

a\. In the singular, the use of `t` (properly `d`) as ending of
nom.-acc. neut.; the combination of another element `sma` with the root
in masc. and neut. dat., abl., and loc., and of `sy` in fem. dat,
abl.-gen., and loc.; and the masc. and neut. loc. ending `in`, which is
restricted to this declension (except in the anomalous `yādṛ́çmin`, RV.,
once). The substitution in B. of `āi` for `ās` as fem. ending (307 h)
was illustrated at 365 d.

b\. The dual is precisely that of noun-stems in `a` and `ā`.

c\. In the plural, the irregularities are limited to `té` for `tā́s` in
nom. masc., and the insertion of `s` instead of `n` before `ām` of the
gen., the stem-final being treated before it in the same manner as
before `su` of the loc.

497\. The stem of this pronoun is by the grammarians given as `tad`; and
from that form come, in fact, the derivative adjective `tadī́ya`, with
`tattvá, tadvat, tanmaya`; and numerous compounds, such as
`tacchīla, tajjña, tatkara, tadanantara, tanmātra`, etc. These compounds
are not rare even in the Veda: so `tádanna, tadvíd, tadvaçá`, etc. But
derivatives from the true root `ta` are also many: especially adverbs,
as `tátas, tátra, táthā, tadā́`; the adjectives `tā́vant` and `táti`; and
the compound `tādṛ́ç` etc.

498\. Though the demonstrative root `ta` is prevailingly of the third
person, it is also freely used, both in the earlier language and in the
later, as qualifying the pronouns of the first and second person, giving
emphasis to them: thus, `sò ‘hám`, *this I*, or *I here*; `sá` or
`sā́ tvám` *thou there*; `te vayam`, *we here*; `tasya mama` *of me
here*, `tasmiṅs tvayi` *in thee there*, and so on.

499\. Two other demonstrative stems appear to contain `ta` as an
element; and both, like the simple `ta`, substitute `sa` in the nom.
sing. masc. and fem. 

a\. The one, `tya`, is tolerably common (although only a third of its
possible forms occur) in RV., but rare in AV., and almost unknown later,
its nom. sing., in the three genders, is `syás, syā́, tyát`, and it makes
the accusatives `tyám, tyā́m, tyát`, and goes on through the remaining
cases in the same manner as `ta`. It has in RV. the instr. fem. `tyā́`
(for `tyáyā`). Instead of `syā` as nom. sing. fem. is also found `tyā`.

b\. The other is the usual demonstrative of nearer position, *this
here*, and is in frequent use through all periods of the language. It
prefixes `e` to the simple root, forming the nominatives
`eṣás, eṣā́, etát` — and so on through the whole inflection.

c\. The stem `tya` has neither compounds nor derivatives. But from `eta`
are formed both, in the same manner as from the simple `ta`, only much
less numerous: thus, `etaddā́` (ÇB.), `etadartha`, etc., from the
so-called stem `etat`; and `etādṛ́ç` and `etā́vant` from `eta`. And `eṣa`,
like `sa` (498), is used to qualify pronouns of the 1st and 2d persons:
e. g. `eṣā ’ham, ete vayam`.

500\. There is a defective pronominal stem, `ena`, which is accentless,
and hence used only in situations where no emphasis falls upon it. It
does not occur elsewhere than in the accusative of all numbers, the
instr. sing., and the gen.-loc. dual: thus,

m\.

n\.

Du.

A.

enāu

ene

ene

G. L.

enayos

Pl.

A.

enān

enāni

enās

a\. The RV. has `enos` instead of `enayos`, and in one or two instances
accents a form: thus, `enā́m, enā́s` (?). AB. uses `enat` also as nom.
neut.

b\. As `ena` is always used substantively, it has more nearly than `ta`
the value of a third personal pronoun, unemphatic. Apparent examples of
its adjectival use here and there met with are doubtless the result of
confusion with `eta` (499 b).

c\. This stem forms neither derivatives nor compounds.

501\. The declension of two other demonstratives is so irregularly made
up that they have to be given in full. The one, अयम् `ayám` etc., is
used as a more indefinite demonstrative, *this* or *that*; the other,
असौ `asāú` etc., signifies especially the remoter relation, *yon* or
*yonder*.

b\. The same forms are used in the older language, without variation,
except that (as usual) `imā́` occurs for `imāú` and `imā́ni`, and `amū́`
for `amū́ni`; `amuyā` when used adverbially is accented on the final,
`amuyā́`; `asāu` (with accent, of course, on the first, `ásāu`; or
without accent, `asāu`: 314) is used also as vocative; `amī`, too,
occurs as vocative.

502\. a. The former of these two pronouns, `ayám` etc., plainly shows
itself to be pieced together from a number of defective stems. The
majority of forms come from the root `a`, with which, as in the ordinary
pronominal declension, `sma` (f. `sy`) is combined in the singular. All
these forms from `a` have the peculiarity that in their substantive use
they are either accented, as in the paradigm, or accentless (like `ena`
and the second forms from `ahám` and `tvám`). The remaining forms are
always accented. From `aná` come, with entire regularity, `anéna`,
`anáyā`, `anáyos`. The strong cases in dual and plural, and in part in
singular, come not less regularly from a stem `imá`. And `ayám`, `iyám`,
`idám` are evidently to be referred to a simple root `i` (`idám` being
apparently a double form: `id`, like `tad` etc., with ending `am`).

b\. The Veda has from the root `a` also the instrumental `enā́` and `ayā́`
(used in general adverbially), and the gen. loc. du. `ayós`; from `ima`,
`imásya` occurs once in RV., `imasmāi` in AA., and `imāis` and `imeṣu`
later. The RV. has in a small number of instances the irregular
accentuation `ásmāi`, `ásya`, `ā́bhis`.

c\. In analogy with the other pronouns, `idám` is by the grammarians
regarded as representative stem of this pronominal declension; and it is
actually found so treated in a very small number of compounds
(`idammáya` and `idáṁrūpa` are of Brāhmaṇa age). As regards the actual
stems, `ana` furnishes nothing further; from `ima` comes only the adverb
`imáthā` (RV., once); but `a` and `i` furnish a number of derivatives,
mostly adverbial: thus, for example, `átas`, `átra`, `átha`,
`ad-dhā́`(?); `itás`, `íd` (Vedic particle), `idā`, `ihá`, `ítara`, `īm`
(Vedic particle), `īdṛ́ç`, perhaps `evá` and `evám`, and others.

503\. The other pronoun, `asāú` etc., has `amú` for its leading stem,
which in the singular takes in combination, like the `a`-stems, the
element `sma` (f. `sy`), and which shifts to `amī` in part of the masc.
and neut. plural. In part, too, like an adjective `u`-stem, it lengthens
its final in the feminine. The gen. sing, `amúṣya` is the only example
in the language of the ending `sya` added to any other than an `a`-stem.
The nom. pl. `amī́` is unique in form; its `ī` is (like that of a dual)
`pragṛhya`, or exempt from combination with a following vowel (138 b).
`Asāú` and `adás` are also without analogies as regards their endings.

a\. The grammarians, as usual, treat `adás` as representative stem of
the declension, and it is found in this character in an extremely small
number of words, as `adomūla`; `adomáya` is of Brāhmaṇa age. The ÇB. has
also `asāunā́man`. But most of the derivatives, as of the cases, come
from `amu`: thus,
`amútas, amútra, amúthā, amudā, amúrhi, amuvát, amuka`.

b\. In the older language occurs the root `tva` (accentless), meaning
*one, many a one*; it is oftenest found repeated, as *one* and
*another*. It follows the ordinary pronominal declension. From it is
made the (also accentless) adverb `tvadānīm` (MS.).

c\. Fragments of another demonstrative root or two are met with: thus,
`ámas` *he* occurs in a formula in AV. and in `Brāhmaṇas` etc.; `avós`
as gen.-loc. dual is found in RV.; the particle `u` points to a root
`u`.

Interrogative Pronoun.

504\. The characteristic part of the interrogative pronominal root is क्
`k`; it has the three forms क `ka`, कि `ki`, कु `ku`; but the whole
declensional inflection is from क `ka`, excepting the nom.-acc. sing.
neut., which is from कि `ki`, and has the anomalous form किम् `kím` (not
elsewhere known in the language from a neuter `i`-stem). The nom. and
accus. sing., then, are as follows:

m\.

n\.

f\.

N.

कस्  
`kás`

किम्  
`kím`

का  
`kā́`

A.

कम्  
`kám`

किम्  
`kím`

काम्  
`kā́m`

and the rest of the declension is precisely like that of त `ta` (above,
495).

a\. The Veda has its usual variations, `kā́` and `kébhis` for `kā́ni` and
`kāís`. It also has, along with `kím`, the pronominally regular neuter
`kád`; and `kám` (or `kam`) is a frequent particle. The masc. form
`kis`, corresponding to `kim`, occurs as a stereotyped case in the
combinations `nákis` and `mā́kis`.

505\. The grammarians treat `kim` as representative stem of the
interrogative pronoun; and it is in fact so used in a not large number
of words, of which a few —
`kimmáya, kiṁkará, kiṁkāmyā́, kíṁdevata, kiṁçīlá`, and the peculiar
`kiṁyú` — go back even to the Veda and `Brāhmaṇa`. In closer analogy
with the other pronouns, the form `kad`, a couple of times in the Veda
(`katpayá, kádartha`), and not infrequently later, is found as first
member of compounds. Then, from the real roots `ka, ki, ku` are made
many derivatives; and from `ki` and `ku`, especially the latter, many
compounds: thus,
`káti, kathā́, kathám, kadā́, katará, katamá, kárhi; kíyant, kīdṛ́ç; kútas, kútra, kúha, kvà, kucará, kukarman, kumantrin`,
etc.

506\. Various forms of this pronoun, as `kad, kim`, and `ku` (and,
rarely, `ko`), at the beginning of compounds, have passed from an
interrogative meaning, through an exclamatory, to the value of prefixes
signifying an unusual quality — either something admirable, or, oftener,
something contemptible. This use begins in the Veda, but becomes much
more common in later time.

507\. The interrogative pronoun, as in other languages, turns readily in
its independent use also to an exclamatory meaning. Moreover, it is by
various added particles converted to an indefinite meaning: thus, by
`ca, caná, cid, ápi, vā,` either alone or with the relative `ya` (below,
511) prefixed: thus, `káç caná` *any one*; `ná kó ‘pi` *not any one*;
`yā́ni kā́ni cit` *whatsoever*; `yatamát katamác ca` *whatever one*.
Occasionally, the interrogative by itself acquires a similar value.

Relative Pronoun.

508\. The root of the relative pronoun is य `ya`, which from the
earliest period of the language has lost all trace of the demonstrative
meaning originally (doubtless) belonging to it, and is used as relative
only.

509\. It is inflected with entire regularity according to the usual
pronominal declension: thus,

a\. The Veda shows its usual variations of these forms: `yā́` for `yāú`
and for `yā́ni`, and `yébhis` for `yāís`; `yós` for `yáyos` also occurs
once; `yénā`, with prolonged final, is in RV. twice as common as `yéna`.
Resolutions occur in `yā́bhias`, and `yéṣaam` and `yā́saam`. The
conjunction `yā́t` is an ablative form according to the ordinary
declension.

510\. The use of `yát` as representative stem begins very early: we have
`yátkāma` in the Veda, and `yatkārín`, `yaddevatyà` in the `Brāhmaṇa`;
later it grows more general. From the proper root come also a
considerable series of derivatives:
`yátas, yáti, yátra, yáthā, yádā, yádi, yárhi, yā́vant, yatará, yatamá`;
and the compound `yādṛ́ç`.

511\. The combination of `ya` with `ka` to make an indefinite pronoun
has been noticed above (507). Its own repetition — as `yád-yat` — gives
it sometimes a like meaning, won through the distributive.

512\. One or two marked peculiarities in the Sanskrit use of the
relative may be here briefly noticed:

a\. A very decided preference for putting the relative clause before
that to which it relates: thus,
`yáḥ sunvatáḥ sákhā tásmā índrāya gāyata` (RV.) *who is the friend of
the soma-presser, to that Indra sing ye*;
`yáṁ yajñám paribhū́r ási sá íd devéṣu gacchati` (RV.) *what offering
thou protectest, that in truth goeth to the gods*;
`yé triṣaptā́ḥ pariyánti bálā téṣāṁ dadhātu me` (AV.) *what thrice seven
go about, their strength may he assign to me*;
`asāú yó adharā́d gṛhás tátra santv arāyyàḥ` (AV.) *what house is yonder
in the depth, there, let the witches be*; `sahá yán me ásti téna` (TB.)
*along with that which is mine*;
`haṅsānāṃ vacanaṁ yat tu tan māṁ dahati` (MBh.) *but what the words of
the swans were, that burns me*;
`sarvasya locanaṁ çāstraṁ yasya nā ’sty andha eva saḥ` (H.) *who does
not possess learning, the eye of everything, blind indeed is he*. The
other arrangement, though frequent enough, is notably less usual.

b\. A frequent conversion of the subject or object of a verb by an added
relative into a substantive clause: thus,
`mé ’mám prā́ ”pat pāúruṣeyo vadhó yáḥ` (AV.) *may there not reach him a
human deadly weapon* (lit'ly, *what is such a weapon*);
`pári ṇo pāhi yád dhánam` (AV.) *protect of us what wealth* \[*there
is*\]; `apāmārgó ‘pa mārṣṭu kṣetriyáṃ çapáthaç ca yáh` (AV.) *may the
cleansing plant cleanse away the disease and the curse*;
`puṣkareṇa hṛtaṃ rājyaṁ yac cā ’nyad vasu kiṁcana` (MBh.) *by Pushkara
was taken away the kingdom and whatever other property* \[*there was*\].

Other Pronouns: Emphatic, Indefinite.

513\. a. The isolated and uninflected pronominal word स्वयम् `svayam`
(from the root `sva`) signifies *self, own self*. By its form it appears
to be a nom. sing., and it is oftenest used as nominative, but along
with words of all persons and numbers; and not seldom it represents
other cases also.

b\. `Svayam` is also used as a stem in composition: thus, `svayaṁjā́`,
`svayambhū́`. But `sva` itself (usually adjective: below, 516 e) has the
same value in composition; and even its inflected forms are (in the
older language very rarely) used as reflexive pronoun.

c\. In RV. alone are found a few examples of two indefinite pronouns,
`sama` (accentless) *any, every*, and `simá` *every, all*.

Nouns used pronominally.

514\. a. The noun `ātmán` *soul* is widely employed, in the singular
(extremely rarely in other numbers), as reflexive pronoun of all three
persons.

b\. The noun `tanū́` *body* is employed in the same manner (but in all
numbers) in the Veda.

c\. The adjective `bhavant`, f. `bhavatī`, is used (as already pointed
out: 456) in respectful address as substitute for the pronoun of the
second person. Its construction with the verb is in accordance with its
true character, as a word of the third person.

Pronominal Derivatives.

515\. From pronominal roots and stems, as well as from the larger class
of roots and from noun-stems, are formed by the ordinary suffixes of
adjective derivation certain words and classes of words, which have thus
the character of pronominal adjectives.

Some of the more important of these may be briefly noticed here.

516\. Possessives. a. From the representative stems `mad` etc. are
formed the adjectives `madīya`, `asmadīya`, `tvadīya`, `yuṣmadīya`,
`tadīya`, and `etadīya`, which are used in a possessive sense: *relating
to me, mine*, and so on.

b\. Other possessives are `māmaká` (also `māmaka`, RV.) and `tāvaká`,
from the genitives `máma` and `táva`. And RV. has once `mā́kīna`.

c\. An analogous derivative from the genitive `amúṣya` is `āmuṣyāyaṇá`
(AV. etc.) *descendant of such and such a one*.

d\. It was pointed out above (493) that the "genitives" `asmā́kam` and
`yuṣmā́kam` are really stereotyped cases of possessive adjectives. 

e\. Corresponding to `svayám` (513) is the possessive `svá`, meaning
*own*, as relating to all persons and numbers. The RV. has once the
corresponding simple possessive of the second person, `tvá` *thy*.

f\. For the use of `sva` as reflexive pronoun, see above, 513 b.

g\. All these words form their feminines in `ā`.

h\. Other derivatives of a like value have no claim to be mentioned
here. But (excepting `sva`) the possessives are so rarely used as to
make but a small figure in the language, which prefers generally to
indicate the possessive relation by the genitive case of the pronoun
itself.

517\. By the suffix `vant` are formed from the pronominal roots, with
prolongation of their final vowels, the adjectives
`mā́vant, tvā́vant, yuṣmā́vant, yuvā́vant, tā́vant, etā́vant, yā́vant,` meaning
*of my sort, like me*, etc. Of these, however, only the last three are
in use in the later language, in the sense of *tantus* and *quantus*.
They are inflected like other adjective stems in `vant`, making their
feminines in `vatī` (452 ff.).

a\. Words of similar meaning from the roots `i` and `ki` are `íyant` and
`kíyant`, inflected in the same manner: see above, 451.

518\. The pronominal roots show a like prolongation of vowel in
combination with the root `dṛç` *see, look*, and its derivatives `-dṛça`
and (quite rarely) `dṛkṣa`: thus,
`mādṛç, -dṛça; tvādṛç, -dṛça; yuṣmādṛç, -dṛça; tādṛç, -dfta, -dṛkṣa; etādṛç, -dṛça, -dṛkṣa; yādṛç, -dṛça; īdṛ́ç, -dṛ́ça, -dṛ́kṣa; kīdṛ́ç, -dṛça, -dṛkṣa`.
They mean *of my sort, like* or *resembling me*, and the like, and
`tādṛç` and the following are not uncommon, with the sense of `talis`
and `qualis`. The forms in `dṛç` are unvaried for gender; those in
`dṛça` (and `dṛkṣa`?) have feminines in `ī`.

519\. From `ta, ka, ya` come `táti` *so many*, `káti` *how many?* `yáti`
*as many*. They have a quasi-numeral character, and are inflected (like
the numerals `páñca` etc.: above, 483) only in the plural, and with the
bare stem as nom. and accus.: thus, N.A. `táti`; I. etc.
`tátibhis, tátibhyas, tátīnām, tátiṣu`.

520\. From `ya` (in V. and B.) and `ka` come the comparatives and
superlatives `yatará` and `yatamá`, and `katará` and `katamá`; and from
`i`, the comparative `ítara`. For their inflection, see below, 523.

521\. Derivatives with the suffix `ka`, sometimes conveying a diminutive
or a contemptuous meaning, are made from certain of the pronominal roots
and stems (and may, according to the grammarians, be made from them
all): thus, from `ta, takám, takát, takā́s`; from `sa, sakā́`; from
`ya, yakás, yakā́, yaké`; from `asāú, asakāú`; from `amu, amuka`.

a\. For the numerous and frequently used adverbs formed from pronominal
roots, see Adverbs (below, 1097 ff.). 

Adjectives declined pronominally.

522\. A number of adjectives — some of them coming from pronominal
roots, others more or less analogous with pronouns in use — are
inflected, in part or wholly, according to the pronominal declension
(like त `ta`, 495), with feminine stems in `ā`. Thus:

523\. The comparatives and superlatives from pronominal roots — namely,
`katará` and `katamá, yatará` and `yatamá`, and `ítara`; also `anyá`
*other*, and its comparative `anyatará` — are declined like `ta`
throughout.

a\. But even from these words forms made according to the adjective
declension are sporadically met with (e. g. `itarāyām` K.).

b\. `Anya` takes occasionally the form `anyat` in composition: thus,
`anyatkāma, anyatsthāna`.

524\. Other words are so inflected except in the nom.-acc.-voc. sing,
neut., where they have the ordinary adjective form `am`, instead of the
pronominal `at` (`ad`). Such are `sárva` *all*, `víçva` *all, every*,
`éka` *one*.

a\. These, also, are not without exception, at least in the earlier
language (e. g. `víçvāya, víçvāt, víçve` RV.; `éke` loc. sing., AV.).

525\. Yet other words follow the same model usually, or in some of their
significations, or optionally; but in other senses, or without known
rule, lapse into the adjective inflection.

a\. Such are the comparatives and superlatives from prepositional stems:
`ádhara` and `adhamá, ántara` and `ántama, ápara` and `apamá, ávara` and
`avamá, úttara` and `uttamá, úpara` and `upamá`. Of these, pronominal
forms are decidedly more numerous from the comparatives than from the
superlatives.

b\. Further, the superlatives (without corresponding comparatives)
`paramá, caramá, madhyamá` also `anyatama` (whose positive and
comparative belong to the class first mentioned: 523).

c\. Further, the words `pára` *distant, other*; `pū́rva` *prior, east*;
`dákṣiṇa` *right, south*; `paçcima` *behind, western*; `ubháya` (f.
`ubháyī` or `ubhayī́`) *of both kinds* or *parties*; `néma` *the one,
half*; and the possessive `svá`.

526\. Occasional forms of the pronominal declension are met with from
numeral adjectives: e. g. `prathamásyās, tṛtī́yasyām`; and from other
words having an indefinite numeral character: thus, `álpa` *few*;
`ardhá` *half*; `kévala` *all*; `dvítaya` *of the two kinds*; `bā́hya`
*outside* — and others. RV. has once `samānásmāt`.
