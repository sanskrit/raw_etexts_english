Images of the hallowed trishirobhairava from kAshmIr, whose avatAra
puruSha is dattAtreya. These idols were originally from temples of
trishiro bhairava near parihAsapura. They show the left side ugramukha
which is (rudra murti) and may have a kapAla, kamaNDalu and akShamAla in
the hands. The same iconography is retained for dattAtreya but, the
kApAla of the trishirobhairava form is not seen. The temples were
destroyed and the idols damaged by the Moslems and their current status
is unclear. The representation of the deity as trishiro-bhairava and
dattAtreya were both supposed to have dogs beside them, but their
presence in these idols is unknown.
