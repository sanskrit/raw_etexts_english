## CXLIII

KASHMIR,  
*25th Aug., 1898*.

DEAR MARGOT, (Margaret E. Noble or Sister Nivedita)

It is a lazy life I am leading for the last two months, floating
leisurely in a boat, which is also my home, up and down the beautiful
Jhelum, through the most gorgeous scenery God's world can afford, in
nature's own park, where the earth, air, land, grass, plants, trees,
mountains, snows, and the human form, all express, on the outside at
least, the beauty of the Lord — with almost no possessions, scarcely a
pen or an inkstand even, snatching up a meal whenever or wherever
convenient, the very ideal of a Rip Van Winkle! . . .

Do not work yourself out. It is no use; always remember — "Duty is the
midday sun whose fierce rays are burning the very vitals of humanity."
It is necessary for a time as a discipline; beyond that, it is a morbid
dream. Things go on all right whether we lend them our helping hands or
not. We in delusion only break ourselves. There is a false sentiment
which goes the extreme of unselfishness, only to injure others by its
submission to every evil. We have no right to make others selfish by our
unselfishness; have we? . . . 

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.
