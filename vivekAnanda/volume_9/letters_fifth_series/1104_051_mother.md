## LI

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

\[54 W. 33RD ST., NEW YORK\]

*14 March 1895*

DEAR MOTHER,

The last letter you sent over is a notice from the Chicago post office
of a parcel received by them. I think it is some books sent to me from
India. The rugs cannot come through the post office (?) I do not know
what to do. I send you therefore back this notice, and if they deliver
it to you, all right — else I hope you will ask them to send it over to
New York and kindly give them my address.

Yours obediently,  
VIVEKANANDA
