C/O. E. T. STURDY, ESQ.,  
High View, Caversham, Reading,  
*5th August, 1896*.

DEAR SAHJI, (Lala Badri Sah. The letter was actually written from
Switzerland.)

Many thanks for your kind greetings. I have an inquiry to make; if you
kindly forward me the information I seek, I would be much obliged.

I want to start a Math at Almora or near Almora rather. I have heard
that there was a certain Mr. Ramsay who lived in a bungalow near Almora
and that he had a garden round his bungalow. Can't it be bought? What is
the price? If not to be bought, can it be rented?

Do you know of any suitable place near Almora where I can build my
monastery with a garden etc.? I would rather like to have a hill all to
myself.

Hoping to get an early reply, I remain, with blessings and love to you
and all the rest of my friends in Almora,

VIVEKANANDA.
