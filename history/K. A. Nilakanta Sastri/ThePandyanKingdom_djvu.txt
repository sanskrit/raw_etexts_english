PREFACE 


THIS book is an amplification, with such revision as has 
been found necessary, of lectures delivered by me at 
the University of Madras in 1926. 

Pfindyan antiquities have, somehow, failed to interest 
scholais as much as the history of the Pallavas and the 
Cholas The relative seclusion of the country, and the 
fact that the Pandyas had at no stage any great influence 
on the main course of Indian history, may account for 
this comparative neglect A complete view of the story 
of South India, however, cannot be obtained until the 
history of the Pandyas is fully worked out 

Though the last twenty or thirty years have been 
marked by the discovery of much new material for the 
reconstruction of Pandyan history, we are still by no 
means sufficiently equipped to attempt a full and satis- 
factoiy account of the Pandyan Kingdom This work 
makes no claim to be considered such. It aims, rather, 
at a preliminary survey of the present state of our know- 
ledge on the subject, suggesting tentative reconstructions 
wherever possible, and furnishing an outline to be filled 
in by further study and research Much attention has 
necessarily been devoted to chronology and political 
history, society, religion and government have been, 
however, briefly discussecf m relation to each section of 
the study. 

• Much work yet remains to.be done before the history 
of the Pandyas can be fully understood The internal 
chronology of the Sangam Age, the history of about two 
centuries before the Pandya Restoration under Kadungon 
and the transition from the conditions of the Sangam 
Age to those of the First Empire, the detailed history of

await solution Many small questions relative to the 
wars and campaigns have to be settled before the changes 
in the political geography of South India can be traced

names and the Pandyas of Uccangi present other problems 
of considerable interest and no less difficult) Oni)

been started, and a careful study of these is necessnr) 
foi a complete understanding of the social life of the

Many friends have helped me in various wa\s in the 
preparation of this book, and to them all I take this 
opportunity of expressing my "latitude Sir F Dcm 
kachari very kindly allowed the use of his librar) and of 
the list of Pudukkoltah inscriptions and their texts (un-

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTORY SOURCES 

IN recent years there has been a considerable accession 
of fresh material for the study of South Indian History 
m general, and of the Pandyan kings m particular But 
no attempt has been made till now to narrate the history 
of the Pandyas in a continuous sketch and on scientific 
lines . 1 The period to be covered in this book ranges 
over several centunes and at every step we come across 
difficult questions that could be answered, if at all, only 
by a careful balancing of several rival points of view. 
The treatment of the subject must consequently be 
selective and such as to avoid fruitless controversy 
We have no need to concern ourselves with general 
questions of the origin of the Dravidians and their 
culture 2 The student of Pandyan history is not directly 

1 There is of course the \alu-ible sketch of Mr K V S Aiyar mhb 
Ancient Dekhan A commendable attempt has recently been made by 
Pandit Hanhara Aiyar of the Tirthapnti High School, Ambasamudram', to 
present the story in Tamil in three small booklets The old sketches of 
Wilson [JR AS), Nelson [Madura Country) and Sewell [Antiquities, 
\ol 11) are now much antiquated 

2 The ‘ Dravidian problem ’* has been much debated from various 
points of view in the pages of the Tamilian Antiquary (defunct) See also 
Caldwell, Comparative Grammar , Introduction , M Srinivasa Aiyangar, 
Tgimil Studies, Essays I— III , Slater, Dravidian Element in Indian Culture 
Kanakasabhai, The Tamils 1800 Years Ago, pp 49 ff , makes several guesses 
that do not appear to have received confirmation The main questions are — 
were the pre-Aryans a homogeneous or composite race ? Were they 1 indi- 
genous and aboriginal ’ (Fergusson) orwere they immigrants, wholly orin 
part*from elsewhere ? The attempt to support the Lemunan theory from 
references to Tamil literature, e g £tlappadikHram, si, 11 18-20, cannot 
be considered satisfactory

concerned with the answers to questions like the follow- 
ing — who were the Tamils ? Were they indigenous or 
foreign to the land where we find them in historical 
times ? Did they come by land from the north or the 
south, or by sea ? But it is necessary for us to be clear 
in our minds about the relation in which Tamil culture 
stands to the culture of the rest of India. The question 
relates not so much to the extent of culture among the 
Tamils before the advent of Sanskrit influences as to 
whether the blending of Aryan with pre- Aryan culture 
was in essence a different process in the South from 
what it was m Northern India The persistent independ- 
ence of the Tamil idiom (and to a less degree of other 
Dravidian languages) m the face of Sanskrit, is in strik- 
ing contrast with the almost total disappearance of non- 
Sanskritic vernaculars m the north of India. On the 
other hand we have at present no traces of any literary 
work in the Tamil language, however ancient, which 
1 does not betray Sanskrit influence to some extent. We 
may conclude that the results of Aryan penetration into 
the south were more cultural than racial and the pre- 
Aryan inhabitants survived the ‘ conquest ’ in sufficient 
strength to retain their own language and many of their 
old habits and methods of life, with the consequence, 
that the resulting culture was a real blend of the 
Aryan and Dravidian elements which shows several 
points of difference from the ‘culture of the remaining 
parts of India which were more thoroughly Aryamzed. 1 

1 See Tamil Studies , pp 193-5 , Kanakas abhai (p 52) no doubt much 
overrated the attainments of Dravidians (and traced them to China !) while 
Caldwell ( Comparative Grammar, pp 113-4) is nearer the truth Dr Slater's 
book on ‘ Dravidian Elements ’ betrays many signs of an utter misreading 
of the story of Indian culture The attempted reconstruction of a pre- 
Aryan Tamil Polity before the days of Agastya has not been a success See, 
however, Senathi-Raja in JRAS, 1887, pp 558 ff and the Tamilian

of the temple Apait fiom such stones, which need not 
be fuither letailed heie, these Pit yam \, — especially the 
earliest vcision, which has been engaging 0111 attention 
more than the otheis, — may be found occasionally to 
contain hints of great impoitancc. Thus the life of 
Mamkkavasagar is treated in such detail as to explain 
the occasions on which he sang paiticulai hymns of Ins 
T tutvUiagam and his life is nauated bcfojc that of 
Gnanasambandai , and in this older, this veision is 
followed by the latci veisions also. It must also be 
noted that some of these ‘ sacred spoils ’ are rcfciicd to 
m the works of early Tamil litciatuie and it is significant 
that none of these eaily lefcicnces shows any sign of 
hostility to Jains 01 Buddhists. 1 These local and tradi- 
tional P111 anas are often veiy well supplemented by 
references in quasi-histoncal and religious works like the 
Pcriyapuianam , while the few direct references to his- 
torical persons and occuirenccs furnished by the saints 
and poets of the Tcvuram and the TiruvUymoh aie of 
inestimable value Ihen, we have the Sangam works 
which form a class by themselves and contain much 
valuable information which still awaits systematic r and

inscriptions, South India is remarkably fortunate. The 
number of Pandyan records registered in the Epigra- 
phical reports of Madras and Travancore are now a few 
thousands , but not many of these can be referred to 
dates prior to A.D. 1000 . There are no doubt many 
more still awaiting discovery and registration. It may 
be noted in passing that, since the rejection by govern- 
ment of Dr. Hultzsch’s suggestion to prohibit the 
renovation of temples till the inscriptions in them have 
been copied, ‘ a more vigorous attempt had to be made 
to secure impressions of the inscriptions thus threatened 
with destruction’ 1 ‘It was the practice in ancient 
times, whenever a temple had to be rebuilt, to copy the 
lithic records found on its walls into a book and then 
re-engrave them again on the new walls ' 2 and it would 
be well if this practice were followed by the renovators 
of temples in our own day. 

The bulk of the early inscriptions employ the script 
known as Vatteluttu m the Tamil parts and the grantha 
J in the Sanskrit parts , Vatteluttu gave way to the present 
Tamil script about the time of the Chola conquest of the 
Pandya country, say about the end of tenth century 
AD. 3 or the middle of the eleventh. It may also be 
noted that several of the later inscriptions are in excel- 
lent verse while the longer records of the early Pandyas 
attain to great literary merit as prose compositions.

(ARE, 1913, part li, para 41), ‘ Some intelligent engravers on the stone 
helped by the members of the Archaeological staff must, in my opinion, 
be enough to carry out this old scheme of preserving ancient records from 
complete ruin ’

Sanskrit part of the grant by Sodase Raj yav arse. Again, 
some inscriptions give the regnal year and the number 
of days since the commencement of the reign or since 
the commencement of the current regnal year , And 
when we get to the numerous epigraphs of the mediaeval

Almost invariably the records of the Pandyas who ruled 
in Tinnevelly in the period of the decline of the Pandya 
power, 1 e. in the fifteenth century and later are dated in 
the Saka era, on the other hand Saka dates are the 
exception m the insciiptions of the mediaeval Pandyas or 
the Pandyas of the Second Empire as we may call them 
But several records contain astronomical data which 
yield often strange and perplexing results. Many kings 
have been made and unmade by hasty calculations and 
equally hasty corrections and the student of history who 
is not a specialist in astronomy has great difficulty with 
the astronomers 1 And when it is remembered that

publication one gets some idea of the conditions under 
which this part of the subject has to be studied. 

As pointed out in the Epigm pineal Report , /<?/? 
(p S5) ‘ The subject-matter of the majority of the well- 

preserved inscriptions is, a gift made to a temple either 
of land or of money, for maintaining daily worship, 
special festivals, lamps, flower gardens and repairs , for 
feeding Brahmanas and providing jewels , or, it may be 
for supplying ghee of sheep and cows, to burn perpe- 
tual lamps in the temple Lands were presented or, 
sometimes, sold to the temple by private persons and 
village communities In the latter case, the sale amount 
was recovered from the temple treasury thiough the god 
Chandesvara (the supposed manager of Siva temple) and 
through temple trustees ( sthanatta > ) (m the case of 
Vishnu temples) All land-gifts, whether sold or 
presented, were made entirely tax-free, the parties selling 
them invariably agreeing to meet the irai on such lands 
from their own pocket. Lands thus owned by the 
temple (devadana) were in turn leased out to be perma- 
nently enjoyed as kam , to select tenants or to the donors 
themselves (if cultivators), in consideration of a fixed 
amount of coin paid, or grain measured, at the temple 
treasury, regularly every year. Money gifts made to the 
temple were deposited with village assemblies and private 
individuals on permanent interest ( mlai-poliyuttu ) from 
which alone the temple had to meet the expenses speci- 
fied by the donor If the interest was not paid m any one 
year, the depositories agreed to pay it with the amount 
due for the following year together with a fine (dandam) 
fixed for the default period by the officer ( dharmasana or 
dhahmasanabhatta) who was one of the members of the 
temple establishment. A curious condition was that the 
man who came to collect the arrears thus due was to be

lo THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 

fed twice every day till, peihaps, the amount was fully 
paid up. Sheep and cows granted to a temple for main- 
taining lamps were received by the shepherds ( maniadts) 
and the prescribed measure or measures of ghee supplied 
without fail The cattle were, it may be noted, consi- 
dered “ never to die or never to grow old ” for the appa- 
rent reason that they multiplied and increased in number. 
A very small percentage of the inscriptions treat of 
subjects other than the gifts specified above. Sale or 
exchange of land among private parties, inquiries into 
temple management made by officers ( adhikan ) appoint- 
ed by the king with a view to collect the outstanding 
arrears of a temple, assignment of taxes by kings or of 
tolls by merchants for the benefit of a temple, dedication 
of hereditary servants (men or women), settlements of 
disputes, specification of caste or communal privileges, 
memorials to heroes who died either in cattle raids or on 
battlefields and other public chanties, such as the 
construction of a tank, the planting of a grove, the gift 
of a water-trough, etc., are also, sometimes, permanently 
recorded on stone It may be added that these records 
often yield information of value relating to land tenure, 
public revenues, village administration, and generally the 
state of social ana political life, affairs and activities 
But here a warning is necessary. The passage just 
quoted from the epigraphical report furnishes a compara- 
tively harmless instance of a tendency to combine infor- 
mation from diverse sources, separated widely m time 
and space, and so to form a general picture of the sodal 
or political life of the country This tendency has 
particularly unfortunate results m the study of institu- 
tions as it is likely to produce an appearance of flat 
uniformity and absence of change , it will also increase 
the difficulty of detecting the presence or otherwise of

any signs of change or growth 0 It is only by carefully 
limiting our observations to the time and place indicated 
by the sources of our information that truth can be 
served in the present, and perhaps future work rendered 
easier 1 

We do not derive much help from numismatics for 
the study of Pandyan history. Coins definitely attribu- ’ 
3 table to the early Pandyas are very rare A few gold 
specimens are known 2 and these bear only the Pandyan 
figure of the fish. It is very interesting that the name 
Kuna known only to tradition and not to epigraphy is 
borne on a copper com figured by Sir Walter Elliot 
(No. 140) It is well known that Roman coins belong- 
ing to different periods have been found in several places 
in South India and the abundance of Roman copper of 
the fourth and fifth centuries A D. in and near Madura has 
sometimes led to the supposition that a local mint issued 
these pieces for daily use m a settlement of foreign 
merchants Many Roman coins of the Early Empire 
have been found m and near Madura 3 By far the 
largest number of coins belong to the mediaeval 
Pandyas and bear legends substantiated by inscriptions 
These coins often show the influence of the Chola con- 
quest by the presence of a tiger design or of Ceylonese 
influence indicated by the presence of ‘ a rude human 
figure, standing on the q obverse, and seated on the 
reverse’ (Elliot, p 108) The earliest coins of the Ceylon 
type date from the eleventh century , 1 it came into use in 
iTravida only, at the time the Chola-Pandyan dynasty 
were masters of the whole of it’ (Elliot, p. 109) It

should also be observed that * the constant warfare 
which raged between Chola and Pandyan (rulers) not 
only renders it well nigh impossible at any particular 
time to fix the exact boundaries of their respective terri- 
tories, but also causes considerable uncertainty in the 
identity of a large number of their coins n n 

This review of the sources indicates that there is a 
large mass of material for the history of the Pandyas c 
which awaits critical discussion and cautious summing 
up Much good work has been done already , but more 
still remains to be done and it will be our endeavour in 
the following chapters to do something in this way.

most interesting of the Pandya corns known so far have been described in 
this publication and Elliot, as also in the papers of Sir T Desikachan in 
the Tamilian Antiquary and that of Hultzsch in I A , vol xxi, pp 323-6 
The Roman coins are discussed by Sewell in the JR A S , 1904 It may 
be noted that Sir T Desikachan mentions that gold coins with the fish 
design were found in South Canara , cf , m this connection, the observa-

EARLY REFERENCES THE AGE OF THE &ANGAM 
' EARLY REFERENCES 

1 The oldest Diavidian word found in any written record 
in the world appears to be the word for “ peacock ” in 
the Hebrew te\t of the Book of Kings and Chronicles, 
in the list of the articles of merchandise brought from 
Tarshish 01 Ophir in Solomon’s ships ’ 1 (Caldwell) 

‘ In the mins of Mugheir . . not less than 3,000 years 
B c , was found a piece of Indian teak ’ 2 These 
references are calculated to give some jdea of the 
antiquity of civilization in the Tamil land. 

A verse m the Kishkindhakaiida of the Ramayana has 
been taken to lefer to the Kapatapuram of the Pandyas 
famed in the Tamil legends of the ‘ Three £angams ’ 3 
But even if the sloka bears the meaning attributed to it, 
it is notoriously unsafe to base any conclusions about 
chronology solely on the texts of the epics and there is 
still the possibility that the verse is not older than the 
age in which these legends grew. It is not altogether 
free from doubt if the grammarian Katyayana refers to 

1 Caldwell, Comparative Grammar , p 88 

2 Ragozin, Vedic India , p 305 referring to Sayce But see Kennedy 
J R A S , 1898, p 267, where a much later date, sixth century, seems to be 
suggested 

3 RSmdyana, Kish Kanda, canto 41, verse 19 It has been pointed out by 
Pandit M Raghava Aiyangar that the import of this verse has been missed 
by TIrtha and Rama, the North Indian commentators, and correctly given 
only by Govindaraja (Paper on ‘ Valmiki and South India ’ in the 
Tamilian Antiquary') But the Pandit seems to have mistaken Govinda- 
raja’s meaning, See also O Stein, Indian Historical Quarterly, vol iv, 
p 778 The MahUbhUrata references are not much more reliable See 
Dr S K Aiyangar, Beginnings of South Indian History, p 60 n

the Pandyan country and its king as has been generally 
held on the strength of the opinions of two great 
Sanskritists of the last generation — Prof. Max Muller and 
Sir R. G. Bhandarkar . 1 The original name of the Tamil 
country is uiremts ) . (Pandi) and not urremQ (Pandu) which 
it should be, if Katyayana’s rule referred to it. And there 
is the possibility that the Pandya of the Sanskrit gram- 
mar may be derived from Pandu, the name of a people in 
the Madhyadesa in Northern India . 2 The name Pandya 
perhaps came to be applied to the Tamil Pandmadu m a 
piocess of Sanskntization on account of phonetic simi- 
larity and a Pandava origin invented for the Tamil ruling 
family Whatever its derivation may be, we find the 
form Pandya employed by Kautilya in his Arthdsastra 
and his references are clearly to the Pandyas of South 
India and to their capital Madura 3 The importance of 
these references will depend upon the view taken of the 
age and authenticity of the text of the Artha'sZstra. 
Likewise the reference in the Mahavam'sa to a Pandyan 
princess who became the queen of Vijaya of Ceylon soon 
after the Nirvana of the Buddha is too vague and too 
much mixed up with legends to be of any value to the 
historian . 4 


1 See Caldwell, Comparative Grammar, p 12 and Bhandarkar, Early 
History of the Dekkan , p 6 These writers were rather too much under 
the influence of the Aryan theory in “Its crude form and did not allow 
sufficiently for aboriginal influences

p 187 , contra Caldwell, Tmnevelly , p 12, who derives uir&zriy. f^nm 
Pandya as a more Tamilized form 

0 Kautilya ii 11 refers to PHndyakavB.{akam as a variety of pearl with 
which compare Varabamlhira’s Pandyavata (Fleet, ibid) Again at the end 
of the same chapter Kauftlya refers to M&dhuram as a variety oi cotton 
fabric, thereby showing the antiquity of the cotton industry of Mndurf.

princess ?

of these inscriptions have so hi disclosed any king's 
name. But they show that the possession of an alpha- 
betical system was one of the factois in the civilisation of

B.C \ if not earlier These monuments go also to show 
the presence veiy early m the south of stiong Buddhist 
and Jama influences. They seem to confum the imprest 
sion derived from a careful study of the Tamil classics 
that while Buddhism came in earlier, Jainism was per- 
haps the more persistent m its influence on Tamil litera- 
ture. Mr Krishna Sastri has observed that ‘ it is strange 
how these sects did not exercise any influence with their 
patrons in the matter of their being provided with 
comfortable rock-cut cells, during their retirement to the 
hills m the rainy season, as their compatriots of the 
north did Perhaps, the South Indian kings of those 
times were inclined moie towards Brahmanical institu- 
tions than Buddhist or Jaina ’ 

THE AGE OF THE SANGAM 

The earliest historical kings of the Pandya country 
are those mentioned in the early Tamil works that have 
come down to us in the form of the collections known as 
the Sangam works. It has been sometimes doubted if 
the Silappadikaram and the ManwieLalai belong to this 
group and the whole question of the age and historicity 
of the Sangam has given rise to controversies whiclvdo 
not seem to be justified on a calm review of the various 
lines of evidence available It is unfortunate that the 
earliest account we have of this matter is envelopfd m 
legends. This account occurs in the mtioduction to the 
commentary on the Iraiycinar Ahapporzil which refers

together m the well-known collections. 1 Even a 
cursory study of the many short poems and others of 
moderate length like the Maduraikkan'ji will show two or 
or three things clearly Firstly , we are dealing with a 
mass of literature that extends over three or four con- 
tinuous generations or perhaps more In the light of this 
internal evidence we may assign a length, of, say, c 150 to 
200 years for the period represented in these works 
Secondly , the political geography of the country 
includes besides the ‘ three monarchies ’ of the south, a 
number of minor principalities ruled over by petty 
warrior chieftains, vying with one another m the arts of 
war and peace. Thirdly , the references frequently made 

to ports, ships and merchandise including foreign 
imports and exports remind us strongly of the notices of 
South India by the classical geogiaphers and historians 
of the early years of the Christian era The common 
references to ports like Musiri, Korkai and Tondi, to 
mention only a few, and articles like pepper, wine and 
silk cloth are too obvious to he missed Lastly , the 
style and diction of these works undoubtedly bear close 
affinities to those of the Silappadikaram and the Mam- 
nrtkalai and are much nearer to these in point of time 
than to the hymns of the Tiruvasagam or the Tevaram 
and the two sets of works cannot belong to the same age 
but lpust be assigned to different periods which may be 
separated by centuries This consideration gams in 
strength from the state of religious life which is reflected 
in the Silappadikai am on the one hand and the devotional 


1 Perhaps it is worth stating that not much importance should be 
attached to the grouping of these anthologies into E((utioka and 
Padmcnkllkanakku espcciallj as the second of these groups seems to take 
in seseral late and unanthenticated works See m this connection V Ven

hymns on the other We have only to recall the 
enumeration of the temples in Puhar (canto 5), the 
Vcttuvavai z^canto 12) and the Aycciyar Kuiavai (canto 
r 7) In the SilappadiLatam 1 and contrast these with the 
fervid devotion to Siva and to Visnu coupled with an 
equally fervid hatred of the heretic sects of Buddhism 
and Jainism that mark the sectarian hymns of the 
fevai am and the T11 nvaymoh, and we at once lealize 
that there is no difficulty involved in assuming an 
interval of some centuries between the two ages , on 
the other hand such an assumption seems to be forced 
on us by other considerations like the absence of any 
reference to the Pallavas in the fsangam works It will 
now be. clear that there is a strong pnma facie case for 
accepting the chronological indications of the Gajabahu 
sjnchionism and referring the fsangam works to the 
early centuries of the Christian era And this arrange- 
ment could not be shaken except by arguments of 
equal cogency which do not conflict with the general 
probabilites of South Indian history 2 

1 The Manvnckalat is strongly tinged with Buddhism but does not 
appear to contain anj thing conflicting with the indications gi\ en by the 
Silappadikdram This work has been studied in its historical setting in a 
recent monograph by Dr S K Aiyangar

based it on broad considerations in order to avoid getting lost in minutiae

Aiyangar’s arguments for a fifth century aie refuted in detail by Mr 
K Snnn asa Pillai (see Oa=aD@i_®aKar of the Pandit and Sen Tamil,

Aravamut^an’s effort to explain one unknown by another in his 
Essay on * The Kaven, MauJ^ans and the £angam Age ’ It is 
perhaps not possible with our present knowledge to explain the references to 



26 THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 

We shall now briefly review some of the considera- 
tions which have been held to militate against this view 
The late Diwan Bahadur L D Swamikkannu Pillai said 
in his Indian Ephemens , vol 1, ‘ Portions of the Pan- 
padal anthology which deal with developments of Saivism 
and Vaisnavism seem to be more recent than the first 
centuiy A D if we are to follow Dr. Bhandarkar and 
other eminent authorities ’ (p 105) Again, Kanaka- ( 
sabhai’s work would have to be renamed ‘ The Tamils 
1 200 Years Ago ’ ‘ These somewhat overdrawn pictures 

of the state of civilization in South India 1800 years 
ago will have to be revised in the light of our present day 
knowledge of epigraphy and chronology, and the scenes 
of the Maduia Sangam will have to be transferred from 
the first century A D to the seventh and the early part of 
the eighth century A.D , the period which witnessed along 
with the decay of Buddhism, the rise of the Saivite 
and Vaisnavite teachers, Tirugnanasambandar, Sankara- 
carya, Nammalvar, etc ’ Incidentally this rearrangement 
will explain the Tamil literary tradition which ascribes 
the Jivakacmtamam to the same age as other Sangam 
works (p 469) Lastly, the Kannaki legend may be as 
old as Gajabahu I in Ceylon, but not older than the 
seventh or sixth century in South India The contem- 
poraneity of the kings mentioned in the Silappadi- 
laram is very doubtful as the figures of Kankala and 

the fights with the Aryaus of the north of Karikala {Sila , canto 5, 11, 
89-110) and of Senguttuva (cantos 26-8), Dr fa K Aiyangar (Augustan 
Age) supposes that the southern kings helped the Satavahana ruler 
Gautamiputra Satakarni in repulsing the Sakas — but this assumption does 
not rest on much solid evidence and does not explain all the references m the 
epics It is also worth noting that the Perundevanar of the Sangam is an 
earlier poet different from the protege of Tellarerinda Nandipotd! See 
Venkayya in A R E,1907, pp 51- 2 and Narrinai ed Narayanaswami

and Dubretul, The Pallavas, p 80

Nedunjeliyan aie shadowy whereas Senguttuvan is the 
one bold figuie ‘ The fiction of wuting a romantic 
poem undei the pen-name Ilango Adikal was cleverly 
conceived ’ (459-60, n ) 

That we read the lnstoiy of lehgious faith in South 
India difteienll) liom Mi Swamikkannu Pillai has been 
already indicated It is not possible to see how that 
distinguished chionologist claims the suppoit of ‘Dr 
Bhandarkar and other eminent authorities ’ for his view 
of Saivism and Vaisnavism in the Pat ipadal as on 
the one hand he has not given any indications that would 
enable us to test the statement, and on the other, Dr 
Bhandarkar’s work is full of the sense of the difficulties 
of marking exact chronological limits in the histoiy of 
religions in India and leaves man) points stuuiedly vague 
At an) late the present writer is constrained to confess 
his inability to see Mi Pill.u’s meaning and lest content 
with the remark that aiguments which lesolve them- 
selves into differences ol opinion cannot, with profit, 
be pursued fai He maj I10 a ever quote Bhandarkar and 
sa) ‘ there is nothing to show' that Vaisnavism had 
not penetrated to the Tamil country eailier 1 e , about the 
first century ’ (p 50) Tnere is indeed a trauition which 
ascribes the JlvaLactntUniani to a Sangam but this very 
tradition seems to distinguish this Sangam from the 
earlier one and refer it to Poyyamoli Pulavar 1 That in 
a w'ork of his brother w r e see more of Senguttuvan than 
of the tw'o other monarchs who were his contemporaries 
in 'the Tamil land is only to be expected and does not 
need any special explanation , much less does it warrant 
the theory that Ilango Adigal is a fictitious pen-name. 
Lastly, when Mr Pillai concedes that the Kannaki

THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 


legend may be as old as Gajabahu I in Ceylon he 
virtually gives away his case , for the ‘ Kannaki legend ’ 
was distinctly of South Indian, not of Ceylonese, origin. 

It now remains to see if our present-day knowledge 
of chronology and epigraphy throws any new light on the 
age of the fsangam , or even if it renders the early 
centuries of the Christian era an improbable period for it 
The astronomical data in the text of the Silappaihkaram 
have been held insufficient by many scholars for the 
purpose of calculating correctly the date of the events 
mentioned therein, and Mr Swamikkannu Pillai’s efforts 
to eke out the text by doubtful paiticulars from the 
commentary cannot be held to be satisfactory, 1 and his 
result has not been generally accepted And there is no 
reason to think that the mention of a week day m a work 
must mean that it is later than A.D 400 as has been main- 
tained by those who advocate a late date for the &ilap- 
padikaram and quote Fleet in their support This has 
been made sufficiently clear by other writers who suggest 
a Chaldean origin for the Indian system A recent writer 
has remarked 2 that 1 the Hindu names (of week days) are 
the exact equivalents of the Roman names which came into 
use in the West about the beginning of the Christian 
era ’ and we know that there was active intercourse 
between the Early Empire and South India at the time 
We now come to the epi^raphical evidence on the 
matter. The facts are — 

(1) The Velvikkudi grant mentions Palyaga Mudu- 
kudumi Peruvaludi as the original donor of Velvikkudi f 

(2) This gift was enjoyed by the donee and his 
descendants for long (; mdu bhuktt) before the Kalabhra

interregnum at the end of which came the Pandya 
restoration under Kadungon, 

(3) Kadungon s giandson is called Silai-ttadakkai 
Kkolai-kkahmi Celiyan Vanavan Sengor-Cendan , 

(4) The larger Sinnamanur plates begin the genea- 
logy with Ankesari Parankusa, evidently the king 
mentioned next to Sendan in the Velvikkudi giant, and 
lefer to the battle of Talaiyalanganam, the translation of 
’the Bhaiaiam and the establishment of the fsangam as 
among the achievements of the early Pandyas whose 
names are not given 

In some discussions the following assumptions have 
been quietly made, though there is nothing in the 
epigraphs themselves to support any of them 1 and some 
of them* are e\en opposed to indications in the records — 
(tf) Mudukudumi ruled immediately before the Kalabhra 
interregnum, (d) the name of Kadungon’s grandson is 
Sehyan, (<) this £eh\an must be the same as the 
famous Talai) alanganattu Nedunjelnan of Sangam fame 
especially because the Sinnamanur plates which begin 
the genealogy immediately aftei this Sehyan lefer to 
Talai) alanganam as among the past glories of the 
Pandyas But Mudukudumi could not have reigned 
immediately before the Kalabhra occupation, for if he did 
so, a man speaking centuries afterwards could not say 
that his gift was enjO)ed for long before the foreign 
inroad. And the name off Kadungon’s grandson is not 
Sehyan, which is only a common name for the Pandyas, 
and occurs here in the midst of an ornate mtioduction

to the king’s real name, Sendan which seems to be 
confirmed by the genealogy of the smaller Smnamanur 
plates which begins with Jayantavarman. Moreover it 
must be explained why, if this fseliyan Sendan as he is 
called by the epigiaphists was the victor of Talaiyalan- 
ganam, a battle so famous in literature as to lend a prefix 
to the name of its hero, that historic fight "is not 
mentioned in the Velvikkudi grant which gives a long 
account of the achievements of the kings it names. It 
thus seems clear that the mention of Mudukudumi and 
Talaiyalanganam in these epigraphs confirms in some 
measure the particulars we gather from Sangam literature, 
and that it throws no new light on the age of the 
Sangam If anything, the reference to the longmterval 
between Mudukudumi and the Kalabhra occupation, 
and the reckoning of the Sangam and the translation of 
the Bharatam together with Talaiyalanganam among the 
legendary achievements which constituted the heirloom 
of the family, may lead an unbiassed student to the 
conclusion that these belong to an age altogether 
removed m the past from the kings whose history is 
recorded m these epigraphs 

We are therefore bound to assume , 1 until much 
stronger proof to the conti ary is forthcoming than has 
been put forward so far, that the Sangam age lies in the 
early centuries of the Christian era and we shall do so in 
the following chapter which attempts a reconstruction of 
the age in so far as it relates to the Pandyan kingdom 

1 This conclusion has been accepted by distinguished writers like 
V A Smith, Early History, pp 471-2 and n 4 at p 457 , and Sir Charles 
Elliot, Hinduism and Buddhism, vol n, p 214 ‘ Most Tamil scholars are 

agreed in referring the oldest Tamil literature to the first three centuries of 
our era and I see nothing improbable in this ’ Hultzsch s objections to this 
date, SII , vol ii, p 378, are too general and impressionistic to need 
separate discussion

THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 


The Maduraiklaiiji refers to two kings as the prede. 
cessors of the Nedunjeliyan of Talaiyalanganam viz., a 
Nediyon ( 1 . 61) identified with Vadimbalamba Ninravan 
by the famous annotatoi Naccinarkkimyar and a Palsalai 
Mudukudumi ( 1 . 759) no doubt the same as the first king 
of the Velvikkudi grant It is not possible to decide 
the distance in time between these two kings or between 
these and the Nedunjeliyan of the Stlappadikaram known 
as Ariyappadaikadanda on the one hand and the other 
Nedunjeliyan who is the hero of the Talaiyalanganam 
fight and of the Maduraikkan ; 1 , as perhaps also of the 
Nedunalvadai We proceed to note the outstanding 
facts about each of these kings recorded in the litera- 
ture of the age 

The king referred to as NediySn or Vadimbalamba 
Ninravan is an almost mythical figure whose achieve- 
ments find a place in the 1 Sacred Sports ’ of Madura, 1 
and also among the traditional achievements of the 
Pandyan kings mentioned in general terms m the 
Velvikkudi and Sinnamanur plates Mudukudumi 
Peruvaludi is a more tangible figure who is praised by 
three poets in five short poems 2 One of them ( Puram 1 2) 
refers to his foreign conquests as the basis of his libera- 
lity, and another by the same poet [Puram 15) 
contains a shocking description of the way he treated 
conquered territory ploughing it with white-mouthed asses 
and refers to the many big sacrifices he performed in his 
day Another poem ( Puram 6) contains a blessing cou- 

pled with extravagant hero-worship which claims all India 
as the territory ruled by this king The king who ruled 
in Madura at the time of the story of the Stlappadikaram

was a Nedunjehyan distinguished by the epithet 
Anyappadaikadanda 1 for reasons that cannot now be 
traced He is said to have died of a broken heart when 
the innocence of Kovalan was proved to him by Kannaki 
bejond all possibility of doubt There is a short poem 
( Pn raw i S 3 ) ascribed to him which puts learning above 
birth 3nd caste. His viceroy at Korkai and perhaps his 
son and successor was another fjeliyan, called Verri Ver- 
celiyan or Uanjehyan, who wreaked terrible vengeance 
on the goldsmiths by sacrificing a thousand of them m 
one day to appease the great goddess who had been 
Kannaki 2 This occurrence which seems to be historical 
in substance must be ascribed to about the time of 
GajabaJiu I of Ceylon, somewhere in the second century 
AD It seems probable that the only other figure that 
stands out boldly from the rest, the victor of Talaiyalan- 
ganam , 3 was later than the rulers mentioned in the 
Silappadikaram . He came to the throne as a jouth and 
early in his reign proved more than equal to a hostile 
combination of his two neighbouring monarchs aided by 
five minor chiefs The decisive engagement took place 
at Talaiyalanganam which has been, with great plausi- 
bility, identified with a village of almost the same name, 
Talai-Alam-Kadu, eight miles north-west of Tiruvalur,

THE PANDYAN£KltiGDOM 

m the Tanjore District 1 There exists a simple poem 
of great force and beauty {Puram 72) in which the young 
king swears an oath of heroism and victory in the ensu- 
ing fight which he appeals to have amply fulfilled. It 
seems that his enemies took the offensive, greatly under- 
rating the strength of the youthful ruler and hoping for 
an easy partition of his territory among themselves. 2 
Nedunjeliyan had to begin his fights almost at the gates ( 
of Madura {Aham 116) and pursue his foes up to the 
scene of the decisive engagement in the Tanjore District 
It must have been in this campaign that Mandaram Cheral 
Irumporai, the son of the Chera King of the Elephant-look 
must have been captuied alive, as is seen from Pur am 17, 
in literal fulfilment of Nedunjehyan's vow referred to 
above ( Puram 72) After thus surmounting his initial 
difficulties in the defensive war that was forced on him 
by his jealous and aggressive neighbours, Nedunjeliyan 
appears to have taken the offensive in his turn and won 
substantial successes against his foes. Two separate 
campaigns seem to be mentioned, one against the Kongu 
chief, an Adigan, the chief event of the war being an 
engagement in a place somewhere near Uj-aiyur , 3 and 
another against the Nidur chieftain Evvi which resulted 
in the annexation to the Pandyan kingdom of the 
Milalaikkurram and the Mutturrukkurram, apparently 
territories in the modern district of Tanjore 4 That this

Nakkirar {Puram 55-57) earned for himself the un- 
enviable distinction of being pilloried in song by two 
poets ( Puram 196, 198) for his llliberality and his name 
was Ilavandikaippallittunjiya Nanmaran We do not 
know how the censure was provoked and how far it was 
justified Famous as the contemporary of the author of 
the Tirukkural, Ugrapperuvajudi proved the strength of 
his arm by subduing the chieftain of Kanapper (Kalaiyar- 
koil) who had entrenched himself behind a strong fortress 
in the place. 1 He was a poet himself and is said in 
tradition to have caused the anthology of the A/iananutu 
to be made This king has been sometimes identified, 
not on quite convincing grounds, with the Nedunjeliyan 
who e xpiated on his thron e the murder of Kovalan. 2 
The last king we shall notice in this necessarily dis- 
connected sketch will be Bhutappandiyan who took 
Ollaiyur and whose queen is well known by her song 
on the occasion of her salt 3 We know little about 
this king except from his own compositions {Puram 71, 
246, 247 and Aham 25) and these present him as a 
loving husband who was lucky in the company of his 
cultured wife and dreaded separation from her, and a 
prince who valued his friends more than is the rule with 
princes 

The period of these ‘numerous kings’ with their 
‘ clumsy names and titles as Smith found it, is well 
portrayed in the literature of the age. A careful study of

Laksmi And Murugan the son of Korravai, is des- 
cribed as the son of six mothers, the captain of the 
forces of the gods, and the wealth of the Brahmins. 1 
Again a poem ( No. 55 ) in the Purananilru contains a 
beautiful reference to the story of the burning of the 
Tripura by Siva and to the shrine of Subrahmanya 
in Sendil (Tiruccendur) , and the Aycciyarkuravai in 
the Silappadikaram contains songs which embody 
the whole cycles of Rama and Krsna legends m 
terms which leave no room for doubt about the 
general prevalence of the mythology of Brahmmical 
Hinduism in the Tamil land m those days. It has 
been suggested that stones like those of Kannappar, 
Chandesvarar and Karaikkal Ammai may be considered 
to contain traces of pre-Aryan religious customs. It 
may be so And the Silappadikaram and the Mam- 
niekalai prove unmistakably the prevalence of Jainism 
and Buddhism side by side with the other cults and this 
indication receives confirmation, as has already been 
pointed out, from the early monuments of the Tamil 
land. 

The form of government was, of course, monarchy. 
It is not possible to understand the exact import of the 
‘ five great Kulus ’ and ‘ eight great Ayams ’ which are 
often referred to as part of the king’s paraphernalia on 
ceremonial occasions 2 Th^se institutions seem to have 
been common to the three monarchies of the Tamil land 
and commentators differ as to their significance The 
older annotation makes the five Kulus consist of the 
people (uur&GsrLo), priests ( urrrruurrrr ), physicians

(.iysnui^dP/r) while a later gloss adds commanders, 
messengers and spies to the ministers and priests 
(t-iQrrrrSprr) to make the five groups Likewise there. 
are two explanations given of the ‘ eight Ayams ’ , the 
earlier one makes them groups of attendants on the 
king’s person like perfumers, dressing boys, etc , a 
•later account names more important groups of persons 
among whom are included the people of the capital city 
(R&rLnrris 1 $[r) and the leaders of the elephant corps and 
of the cavalry One should like to know more about 
these apparently ceremonial groups of attendants, officials 
and non-officials, before one accepts Mr Kanakasabhai’s 
statement that ‘ the council of representatives safe- 
guarded the rights and privileges of the people ’ 1 It 
is well known that the ideals of monarchy laid down in 
the Kmal are of a very high order, and these seem to have 
been constantly pressed on the monarch’s attention by 
the numerous poets of the land in the age we are dealing 
with Thus one poet {Puram 184) vividly contrasts the 
effects of moderate taxes which replenish the royal 
treasury periodically and make the king popular with 
those of oppressive exactions which impoverish the 
country and render the king unpopular , and illustrates 
his meaning by the difference in the cost of feeding an 
elephant from a barn and of letting him roam freely 
over fields ripe for the harvest Another {Pur am 55) 
stresses the need for impartiality in the king’s justice, 
and valour, grace and liberality in his conduct in terms 
that deserve to be quoted in the original

It is more interesting to notice the reference in the 
Sifa p padilaram (canto 17, 1 7) to the supply of ghi to 
the king’s household in Madura in terms which remind 
us of Megasthenes’ statement that one village should 
each day bring to the treasury the royal tribute, which 
was apparently a tribute in kind, consisting of provisions 
for the daily consumption of the royal household. 

Social life especially in cities like Madura had attain- 
ed a high degree of refinement as could be seen from the 
literature of the age. It may be noted in passing that 
this literature was not always the work of poets who 
pursued poetry for its own sake Minstrelsy was a 
profession, and the roving bards of the time were often 
not easy to satisfy, and sometimes exceedingly sensitive. 
We have already noted instances of princes penalized 
by the scarcely veiled imprecations of poets who felt 
they had not been hospitably treated. A song in the 
1 'inanunTiru contains a rather humble description of these 
organized bands of mendicants — some of them poets of 
real merit, some of them musicians with all kinds of quaint 
instruments, who moved about, with bands of female 
singers and dancers, from one little fortress to another, 
where their advent formed one of the few distractions 
of life for the chieftain, alternating with his hunting

not alwavs models of courtesy or liberality, and some 
of them must have deserved the censures they provoked 
The Uad t nail>kai }t w Inch is a long poem of nearly 
Soo lines contain man) little pen-pictures of great interest 
to the student of the social life of the age We cannot 
do mote than draw attention to a few' of these here The 
descriptions of fights and foitifications (c.g 11. 64-7) show' 
evidence of a fairly advanced stage in the art of warfare. 
It is interesting that the Paiathavar are mentioned as 
special]} noted for then heroism 111 war (11 139-1 h) and 
thev perhaps supplied good rcci tilts to Ixedunjeh} an’s

us of similar accounts in the Pt ltpLts and of the mention

in the portraiture of 'Madhavi and Kannaki m the 
Silappadikaram . Some women were also known as 
poets while others followed a life of religious seclusion. 
Brahmins chanted the Vedas early in the morning and 
the musicians practised on their favourite instruments 
much as they do now. 

There is no doubt that many of these pictures are 
drawn by the poets of the age in obedience to literary 
convention , but such convention must have been reared 
on a fairly solid foundation in the facts of contemporary 
life In this brief sketch, our attention has been given 
mainly to a part of this literature that can be definitely 
referred to the Paudya country. But the unity of Tamil 
life m the three kingdoms and the many principalities 
can only be realized by a more extensive study which 
cannot be undertaken here 1 

There appears to be no means at present of fixing 
the chronology of the Sangam age more exactly than we 
have sought to do so far We are in the dark as to 
when and how the period came to a close. The data 
that have been gathered together from the Sangam 
literature may, one may venture to suggest, carry us to 
about the middle of the third century A D. or perhaps a 
little later When next the curtain rises, it is on a scene 
that belongs to the middle or even the end of the sixth 
century A.D We thus seem to have in between these 
two periods, a veritable dark a'ge of about three centuries 
of which we know nothing at present Even the 
contemporary Pallava history of the age, into which 
we get some glimpses from various sources, seems 
to throw little light on the history of the extreme south. 

1 Still the best sketch is that of Kanakasabhai, The Tamils, ch but it 

is high time that another account which will keep more m touch with the 
sources of our information is attempted There is scope for a good mono- 
graph on the subject

THE TRANSITION TO TDD FIRST EMPIRE

Wn have no information a« to the exact step 5 : b) which 
the transition was brought about from the conditions 
reflected in the Sangam literature to those of the Age 
of the First Empire, as we propose to call it, — an age 
comprising rough!) three centuries from, say, the begin- 
ning of the se\enth ccnturj to the beginning of the 
tenth And the great danger at this point of the story is 
the temptation to make hasty reconstructions b) piecing 
together fragments from literature and epigraphy wdnch 
at the first blush seem to have a connection with one 
another, but on closer scrutiny fail to support the super- 
structure they have been made to bear Great impediments 
to a proper understanding of the records result some- 
times from chance suggestions throw'n out by authori- 
tative scholars v'hichare often repeated by their followers 
without the reservations with which they w^ere originally 
given and occasionally even palpable errors are handed 
down as gospel 1 In the present account no attempt will

be made to carry the story beyond what js exactly

which he handled for the first time But his successors make n mistake 
when they fail to test his results independently for tbemsehes before accept- 
ing them as established facts But (1) Mr Vtnkayya must in some measure 
beheld responsible for starting the habit of confusing different kings with 
similar names Thus he said, * The names Nedumaran, Nedunjefijan and 
Nedunjadayan are quite similar, and one is almost tempted to think that 
they must have denoted the same indnidual and though he took care 
to add 1 Beyond this similarity of the mere names we possess no materials 
for their identification' {I A ,vol xxn, p 65), some of his successors 
have not exercised the same caution— e g the so called Selijan of the 
Velvikkudi grant has been identified witn Ncdunjelijan by Mr K V S 
Alyar (see chap iii above) (2) Mr Venkayyn also misread some of the 
names of the kings He called Kadungon's grandson fsehyan isSndan 
{ARE, 1907-08, p 51) in summarizing the Tamil portion of the 
Vejvikkudi grant Again, in the same summary, he called the father 
of Parantaka by the name Termaran , it is strange that Mr Krishna Sastri 
should have followed this reading of the king’s name and perpetuated 
the mistake in his edition of the grant in E J , vol \ui The king’s 
name is only Maran , ter should be read along with the preceding viiin 
as a compound adjective to the king’s name (See K G Sankara, 
I A, vol H, p 214) By a similar mistake he recognized a TCr Vnrodaj an 
besides Varodayan in the Iratyattiir A/iapporu( stanzas and identified the 
hero celebrated in those verses with his 'lermaran [ARE, 1907-8, 
p 57) In this, however, Mr Krishna Sastri takes care not to follow 
him {E / , vol xui, p 297) (3) Lastly he committed a somewhat serious 

error in the collation of the data from the larger SinnamanQr and the 
Velvikkudi grants and working up the genealogy of the Pandyas mentioned 
in these grants {ARE, 1907-8, pp 54-55) This has been set right 
in a large measure by Mr Krishna Sastri giilng up the consideration 
which was the most \ital in VenkayyVs account of the matter, \iz , 
' that the Nedunjadayan of the Velvikkudi grant cannot be identical with 
his namesake of the Madras Museum plates, but that the former fnust be 
earlier than the latter’ (see also T A Goplnatha Rao in Sen Tamil, \ ol 
vi, pp 437-39) Gopinatha Rao’s genealogy at p 154 of Trav Atch 
Senes, vol i, is inaccurate and insufficiently documented 



THE TRANSITION TO THE FIRST EMPIRE 39 


The clue! records wduch furnish data on the genealogy 
.and chronolog) of the Pandjasof the First Empire are — 

1 The Vcluhl utfi emit of Parantaka NcflunjaOaj an 

2 The Smaller Smnamanfir plates 

3 Tlic Lirecr Smnamaniir pi ites of Rajasmilia 

4* Tlic Madras Museum plates of Japlaxarman 

5 The tan rcl ited \namalai stone inscriptions of 
Ml-aojaOa\ an (133 of 1 *100) and Parmtaha (434 of 1906), 
tlic latter dated m the ICaliwijr i era and \ icldine A n 770 

6 The Anarmalai Inscription of Varapuna dated m 
Saha 792, i e h70 \ i> corrcspondine to the eighth rcenal 
\ ear of the Kmr 

Tlic first thing to do with these Records is to settle 
the genealog) of the dj nasty with the aid of the copper 
plate grants which gi\e particular enabling us to do 
this and to assign these grants themselves to the respec- 
ti\e kings to w'hosc reigns the) belong It has been 
generally accepted that the Sanskrit portion of the 
Velvikkudi grant mentions onl) the last lour names in 
the list contained in IheTamil portion wduch extends over 
seven generations and the last king Parantaka a/ias Jatila 
of the Sanskrit part is identified with Nedunjadayan the 
last king of the Tamil paitand corresponding identifica- 
tions made in regard to the three preceding generations. 
It has also been generally accepted that this Parantaka 
Nedunjadayan of the Velvikkudi grant is the same as 
Jatila, the second king of the Sanskrit portion of the 
larger Sinnamanur plates — wdiose name has been un- 
accountably passed over in their Tamil part But this 
^ arrangement leads to a duplication of kings with the 
^ same name for w'hich there seems to be no warrant or 
explanation On the other hand, if w'e identify Parantaka 
Nedunjadayan of the Velvikkudi grant with Varaguna 



40 


THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 


Maharaja of the larger Smnamanur plates, this difficulty 
is avoided. And we have ample support for this course. o 
Parantaka is coupled with Nedunjadayan by the Velvik. 
kudi grant and with Maranjadayan 1 e. Sadayan the 
son of Maran by the Anamalai records , and the 
Tnchmopoly inscriptions (413 and 414 of 1904) of the 
reign of Maranjadayan call the king Pandyadhiraja 
Varaguna 1 By this identification of Parantaka Nedun- 
jadayan with Varaguna, not only is the perplexing 
duplication of Raj asimha avoided, but Varagunavarman 
and Parantaka VIranarayana become the grandsons of 
Parantaka alias Varaguna Maharaja which seems quite 
natural It also seems to me — this is only a personal 
impression — that the campaigns indirectly referred to in 
the Ambasamudram inscription of Varaguna Maharaja 2 
are best ascribed to Parantaka Nedunjadayan of the 
Velvikkudi grant, who according to that grant fought 
and won battles on the banks of the Kaveri early in his 
reign One apparent objection to this course is found 
in the chronological indications given by oui records 
and this has been held 3 to be fatal to the arrangement of 
the genealogy of the Pandyas suggested here , but we 
shall see presently that the difficulty, if there is one, 
is not insuperable It may be well at this stage to give 
the genealogy of the kings as fixed by the identifications 
proposed hitherto 


1 There can be no doubt that the fynapit of the Vejvikkudi grant is the 
same as the excavator of the Anamalai temple and that consequently these 
two records belong to the same kmc; Mr Venkayya was inclined to ascribe 
the Trichinopoly records to Varagunavarman, the elder son o^f Sriroara 
Srfvallabha, but he stated no reasons for his view which he said was only 
provisional {ARE, 1907, p S3, para 21 )

Before taking up the cluonolog\ of the period for 
discussion, something must be said about the smaller 
Sinnamanur and the Madras Museum plates These 
two sets are engraved b\ apparently the same scribe and 
this justifies the assumption that the iccords must be 
assigned to the same reign, especially as the writing in 
the smaller ^lnnamanur inscription is held to resemble 
6 



42 THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 

that of the Madras Museum plates of Jatilavarman . 1 
But these considerations are not as conclusive as one 
would wish. It must be noticed that while the smaller 
Smnamanur plates make Arikesan the son of Jayanta- 
varman, the Velvikkudi grant is not so specific in the 
Tamil portion and indicates the relation between An- 
kesan and ^endan by the vague phrase ‘ tn/Dpsuirs^u 
uyQuiQesr/SI evLfi^Q^rresr/SI \ 2 and the Sanskrit portion 
of the Velvikkudi grant gives no help here as it begins 
only with Ankesari After some discussion, it has be- 
come clear that the Madras Museum plates of Jatila- 
varman too must be ascribed to Parantaka Nedunjadayan 
of the Velvikkudi grant. Palasographical considerations 

1 See ARE , 1907, p 52 and K V S Aiyar [op at , pp 103-4) 
Nothing can be stated finally about the smaller Smnamanur grant The 
grant is incomplete and the text is still unpublished It is not known how 
many plates are missing There is however just a possibility that the grant 
belongs to Kdccadayan (No 5 of the genealogy in the text), the king who 
fought at Marndur, in which case the engraver may be taken to be the 
grandfather of the engraver of the Madras Museum plates But there can 
be no doubt that Venkayya was strangely misled by vague palmographical 
considerations into ignoring the probability of the identity of Sendan and 
Jayanta 

e Mr Krishna Sastri gets over the difficulty by saying tufipCptrca-pev 
means ‘son ', I am afraid that this gives no help in interpreting the expression 
quoted which is not GpirarpcoirQ , but eaifipGpirarjS Nor is Mr K G 

Sankara’s suggestion that Arikesan was the son of a daughter of Sendan 
easy to accept If, as is not unlikely, the smaller SinnamanSr plates are 
earlier than the Velvikkudi grant and belong to the reign of Ranadhira, 
then their evidence must be preferred to that of the Ve)vkhudl grant But 
after all, it may be that the Velvikkudi grant itself is not in conflict with the 
Sinnamanflr plate For some reason the Sansknt part of the Velvikkudi 
grant begins only with Arikesan and the Tamil part, for the same reason, 
may be taken to make a fresh start with this king, Ankesan, though he was 
the son of the immediately preceding Sendan [E I , vol xvii, p 365, n 5 
and K G Sankara, I A , vol li, p 213 and Q J M S , vol x, p 17^5) It 
may be noted in passing that nothing has turned up to justify Mr Ven- 
kayya’s suspicion that the kings of the smaller Sinnamanflr and the Madras 
Museum plates may not belong to the mam line of the Pandyas [ARE, 
1908, p 55)

the grants. Such are Panditavatsalan, Virapurogan, 
Vikramaparagan, Parantakan, Nedunjadayan and also 
Sri varan. The btruda , Kantakanisturan of the Velvik- ' 
kudi grant is echoed by the phrase Q&irpcksr 

p rr ear Q&tu&i of the Museum plates. It is extremely 
unlikely that all these different birudas were common to 
two different kings. Secondly among the subdopees of 
the Velvikkudi grant is a Murti Eyinan who is specially 
mentioned (1 1 36) The tipiapti of the Madras Museum 
plates is a Dhirataran Murti Eyinan who was a maha- 
samanta of the king There is reason to think that these 
two references are to the same person who may have 
been, as has been suggested on the strength of the 
Anamalai records, a brother of Marangari who was the 
analti of the Velvikkudi grant and the king’s utiara- 
manln when he excavated the Anamalai cave. 1 Lastly 
the Velvikkudi grant ascribes an important victory 
against the Pallavas to Parantaka’s father Maran, or { 
Maravarman Rajasimha as he is called in the Sanskrit 
portion, and the Museum plates ascribe to Jatilavarman’s 
father Maravarman the btruda Pallavabhanjana, and this 
surely may be taken to furnish a confirmation of the 
probability suggested by the two considerations urged 
above. It is thus clear that though there may be 
some scope for doubt as to the place of the smaller

that the Madras Museum plates of Jatilavarman belong 
to the reign of the same king as the Velvikkudi 
grant. 

We may now turn to the chronology of the period. 
The best starting-point is furnished by the Anamalai

successor fsrimara Srlvallabha may have been exception- 
ally long yielding an average of forty-six years or a little 
more for each of the reigns. If a precedent is needed in 
support of this position, we may turn to Prof. Dubreuil 
who allows 1 13 years between the accession of Nandi- 
varman Pallavamalla and Nandi of Tellaru separated by 
only one reign, viz that of D anti varman 1 There- is thus 
no serious chronological absurdity involved in the assump- 
tions we have made regarding the identity of the kings llx 
these records It may be accepted that Rajasimha II 
(No. 11) the last king in our genealogical table was the 
Rajasimha Pandya who was defeated by Parantaka I Chola 
early in the tenth century A D 2 as this fits in well with 
the chronology of the age as derived from the Aivarmalai 
record. If we calculate backward from the Anamalai 
record allowing, say, twenty-five years on the average for 
each generation we arrive at some date at the beginning 
of the seventh century A.D. for the accession of Kadungon 
from whom our genealogy begins Even the end of the 
sixth century may be accepted as possible. We thus 
see that the epigraphs we have been discussing at such 
length relate to the history of the three centuries from the 
beginning of the seventh centuiy AD to the beginning 
of the tenth and this period we might call the Age of 
the First Empire The period begins with a restoration 
and witnesses a rather wide extension of Pandya power 
at the expense of the Paliavas who apparently had 
succeeded in dispossessing the Cholas of their ancestral 
dominions even before the Pandya expansion began. It 
is marked by repeated contests between the Pandyas 
and the Pallavas which is carried on right through these

centuries with varying fortunes It ends with the

sois and ma) be said to close with the attack delivered 
at the heart of the Pandvan Empire by Parantaka I, the 
grandson of Vijayalaya, who began his rule early in the 
tenth century \ D It now remains foi us to narrate in 
some detail the stoiy of the age as we aie able to 
reconstruct it, and then bi mg together such particulars 
about the social and political life of the period as we 
can gather fiom the contemporaiy records of the age. 
We shall attempt to do this presently, but, before doing 
so, we must give some consideration to the vexed 
question of the Kalabhra occupation of the Pandyan 
country * 

The Velvikkudi grant only says (11 39-40), ‘ Then 
a Kali king named Kalabhran took possession of the 
extensive earth driving away numberless great kings 
(ad/111 n/ns) ’ and tells us no more about it, although it 
refers to the Kalabhras in the plural and their brave ocean- 
like ami) (1 111) 1 Mr Krishna Sastn is inclined to 
accept the suggestion that Kali was the name of a dynasty 
of kings, Kalikula, 2 but nothing is known of such a 
dynasty yet and the mention of the Kalabhras in the plu- 
ral in the Velvikkudi grant itself and elsewhere seems to 
point to a military tribe rather than a dynasty of rulers 
We can only say that the Kalabhras overran the Pandya 
country sometime aftei Mudukudumi’s time , how long 
after we cannot say ‘ How the Pandyas were overcome 
by the Kalabhras, how long the sovereignty of the lattei 
lasted and how they were driven back are points on

slightly to misunderstand the word^acrre^iSeucwr in 1 111

which no information is at present forthcoming’ (Ven- 
kayya) It may however be noted that the Pallava „ 
king Simhavisnu who stands at the beginning of an 
important line of Pallava rulers, just as Kadungon does 
in the case of the Pandyas, and whose accession has 
been placed at c AD. 575 by Dubreuil, also claims to 
have conquered the Kalabhras , and the date we have 
arrived at for Kadungon is the beginning of the seventh 
century A.D or even the end of the sixth century This 
raises the presumption that the Kalabhra occupation was 
a danger which threatened the independence of both the 
Pandya and the Pallava dynasties and that these poweis, 
either independently or m co-operation with each other, 
managed to throw off this incubus before they started 
on their long careers of expansion and success which so 
often brought them into collision with each other and 
lasted for close upon three centuries until the newly 
risen power of the Cholas of the Vijayalaya line gave k - 
them a check at the close of the mneth and beginning ^ 
of the tenth centuries. 1 

1 Mr Venkayya made an attempt to clear up the story of the Kajabhra 
occupation from Murti Nayanar Puranam in the Penyaptirdnam and the 
TtruvilatyUdal {ARE, 1908, p 53) But there is nothing m the Purina 
except the mention of a Karnataka king of Jama persuasion ruling 
in Madura which can connect it with this age (See K G Sankara, 
QJMS,vo\ x, p 178) Murti, not Kadungon, succeeds the childless 
foreign ruler in the Purina Judging by results, Venkayya committed 
a more serious mistake in suggesting the identity of Kajabhra with the 
Erumaiyuian, one of the opponents of the Pandyan king m the battle of 
Talaijalanganam and saying, 'it may be that Nedunjeliyan drove out from 
the Pandya country the Kalabhras ’ (ARE, 1908, p 53) This has 
led others to identify Ned un jelly an with Jayantavarman, as we have seen 
before Mr T N Subramanian (Q J M S , vol xu, pp 304-6) makes a 
number of statements which are not easy to support from the jevidence 
at our disposal He says ‘ From the analogy (in the Velvikkudi grant) 
it appears that the Pandya line was unknown to the world while the 
Kalabhras ruled there Thus the evidence of the Penyapurinam that there 
was no Pandya prince (1) left to succeed \vhen a Kalabhra king died might 



CHAPTER V 
THE FIRST EMPIRE 

We have little information about the first two kings 
after the restoration, Kadungon and his son Maravar- 
man Avanisulamam, whose reigns may be taken to have 
occupied the close of the sixth and the beginning of the 
seventh century A D. All that we know of them comes 
from the Tamil portion of the Velvikkudi grant and that is 
not much The nearest approach to specific historical 
statements about KadungSn is m the expressions prexfl 
LbiEJtsmaeinuJu tdrrureo e-iReni*? fired fie; rr 8 a 9 p penur 
jW/flonto mar&esr u>enu>&p (11 43”44) which go to show 
that Kadungon must have had an active share in putting 
an end to the Kalabhra interregnum and bringing about 
the restoration of bis own dynasty, as he is said to have 
abolished by his strength the claim of others to the eart’n 
and established his own claim on a firm basis (reesrreynl) 
We hear even less about the reign of KadungSn’s son, 
Maravarman Avanisulamam, who appears from the 
general expressions employed about him to have con- 
tinued the work begun by his father and maintained his 
power at least as he inherited it though he did not 
perhaps add much to it. 

The rule of Sendan or Jayantavarman who succeeded 
his father Maravarman may be taken to have extended 
over, say, A D 645—70 He is praised for his prowess m 
war and for the justice of his rule He also bears the 
name Vanavan which seems to indicate that he won some 
successes against his Chera contemporary When we 
come to Jayantavarman’s successor, who was most proba- 
bly his son, our records become more helpful and mention 
specific incidents which can also be traced in the literary 



THE FIRST EMPIRE 


51 


sources relating to the age This king is called Arike- 
san Maravarman in the Velvikkudi and smaller Jsinna- 
manur plates and Arikesan Parankusa in the larger 
Sinnamanur grant By the system of chionology we 
have adopted, this king must have come to the throne 
some time aflei the middle of the seventh century 
(670—7 ro) A D In this reign began the great contest 
with the Pallavas who were rising to power, contempor- 
aneously with the Pandyas, m the noithern pait of the 
Tamil land The Velvikkudi grant says of him that he 
" on a victory at Pali, that he conquered the vast forces 
of Vilveli in the battle of Nelveli, and this statement is 
confirmed by the larger Sinnamanui plates which say 
of him . 1 JfcocoaiQjjLD QmcnQaicS tui&sffiR Qurrift jn&'m&rutiw 

Gjiau UGtiotiajQtjLD iS'tEi&GHri u r rr cir ’ It IS not now 

easy to identify these battlefields and no attempt can 
therefore be made to trace in any detail the campaigns so 
briefly recorded in the plates It is extremely difficult to 
accept the suggestion that Nelveli stands for the modern 
town of Tirunelveli 1 There are other achievements

of the eighth century n.s the date for Arihcsnri PnrunkuSa and Identified the 
camp ugas of this king with those of Udnyacnadra, the Pnllnva genernl 
referred to in the Udajcndiram plates of NnndKannnn (S / / , aol u, 
pp 361 (T ) The occurrence of the names NelvCli and S'lnkarngriuna among 
the battles won by Udayncandrn may seem to lend some support to this 
\iew Hut apart from the objections we ha\e urged against the whole sys 
tern of Mr Vcnkajja's identifications, we may draw attention here to the 
following points which seem to render it impossible to follow him (1) He 
allows only twenty years for each generation, an e\tremely short allowance 
to make in calculating by nverages the chronology of nn uncharted age 
(2) In the revised genenlogy he gives nt p 54 of A R E 1907 08, he 
separates the battles of NehCli and tsnnknramangni and asenbes the 
former to the son of Sendan and the lntter to his (son’s) grandson— a course 
which is difficult to justify in tho face of the VCJvikhudi grant ascribing 
Nelveli *to the former definitely, nnd the fainnamanfir plates coupling 
Nelveli with Sankaramnngai and ascribing them to an ArikSsan ParankuSa 
whose identity remains to be made out We could understand Mr Venkayya 
if he had at least repoated a second battle of Nelveli among the later (his)

impression of a great expansion cff power brought about 
by this king The Paiavas were no doubt the people on 
the south-east coast of the Pandyan country who still 
continue to bear the same name The Kurunadu which was 
apparently annexed after a conquest is not so easy to 
identify. And the campaigns against the Kerala king are 
narrated in a lather confused passage, and the text seems 
to be open to several alternative readings, none of which 
seems to render it possible to give a connected account 
of the campaign 01 campaigns leferred to. And it is not 
clear against whom the fight at Sennilam was undertaken 
or where we have to look for Sennilam 1 But amidst all 
this uncertainty, one large fact stands out cleaily It is 
evidently under this king that the Pandyan power comes 
into collfsion, apparently for the first time in this penod, 
with its neighbours the Pallavas on the noith and 
the Keralas on the west , and as important successes 
seem to have been won, we may take it that the Pandyan 
kingdom extended its tein tonal limits in both these 
directions beyond its traditional boundaries And this 
expansion of Pandyan rule into foreign teintory, that 
is, into territory lying outside the traditional limits of the 
Pandyan country, remains a permanent factor in the 
history of the rest of this period, and leads us to describe 
it as the Age of the First Empire. 

There is good reason for identifying this Ankesari 
Parankusa Maravarman with the celebiated Kun Pandya 
of legend, and the contemporary of the £aiva saint 
Tirugnanasambandar This saint is known to have 
been the contemporary of another saint £iruttondar and 

1 It may be suggested that Sennilam is not a proper name but that the 
word on^ means a battlefield and maj refer to any or all the battles won by 
the king But the te^t of the inscription (1 56, Vejvikkudi) and the refer- 
ences to Sennilam in the commentary to the Agapponi{ leave quite a 
different impression on the mind.

to have converted to Saivism the Pandyan king who was 
thence regarded as a saint himself This king is called 
Nmrasirnedumaran, and Sundaramurti in his catalogue 
oE Jsaiva saints ascnbes to him the battle of Nelveli. The 
age of £iruttondar was the time of the destruction of 
Vatapi, the Chalukya capital, A D 642. These indications 
derived from the stones handed down in the Pertyapura- 
nam seem to confirm the system of chronology we have 
adopted for the Pandyas of this penod 1 It may be noted 
m passing that there is nothing improbable m the story 
that the Pandyan queen of this period was a Chola prin- 
cess. The Cholas are not prominently mentioned any- 
where in the records of this age, but they appear to 
have continued in obscurity somewhere in their, original 
territory on the banks of the Kaveri and it is likely they 
sought or were forced into matrimonial connections with 
the rising house of the Pandyas 2 Finally, we may say 
that there seems to be no ground for accepting the 
identification of this king with the hero celebrated in the 
stanzas of the commentary to the Iraiyanar AhapporuL 

1 Sundaramurti’s Tiruttompattogai, st 8, 11 3-4 , and Penyapurdnam 
lives of the saints mentioned , Venkayya in El, vol m, pp 277-8 
and Dubreuil, The Pallavas, pp 67-8 Sij-uttondar was older and Mara- 
varman Pandya perhaps younger than Gnanasambanda 

a See verse 603 m the life of Gnanasambanda in the Penyapurdnam and 
note that the Aihole inscription of Pulakesin ( verse 30 quoted by Dubreuil, 
The Pallavas, p 37) connects the Cholas with Kaveri even m this age 
Mr Venkayya says also ‘ With the ( powerful Pallavas on the north and 
the strong Pandyas in the south, the Cholas, who were hemmed in between 
the two, had evidently to be satisfied with a comparatively insignificant 
position The Chola capital was probably Uraiyur during all 

this period and the tract of country subject to them must have been very 
small The intermarriages with the dominant Pandyas make it likely that 
the Cholas occasionally made common cause with them against the 
Pallavas who must have been looked upon as intruders ’ {A S I , 
1905-6, p 178 ) There is thus no reason to accept the coficlusion 
sometimes drawn from Yuan Chwang’s itinerary that the Cholas were con- 
fined m this penod to Cuddapah and Kurnool Contra, K V S Aiyar, 
Anctent Dekhan, pp 112-3

These stanzas indeed mention the battles of Pali, £enni- 
lam and Nelveh and call the king by the titles, among 
others, of Arikesari, Parankusan and Nedumaran. But 
there are several other battles mentioned, e g., Vilmam 
of which we do not hear in epigraphy till late m the eighth 
century and this renders the proposed identification 
impossible to sustain 1 

. The son of Arikesari Parankusan was Koccadayan 
also called Ranadhlra He must have succeeded his 
father at the end of the seventh century A.D. or early in 
the eighth. This king appears to have been a great 
warrior who often waged aggressive war against his 
neighbours He is given the titles Vanavan, ^embiyan, 
Solan 'tfhich seem to imply some claim to supremacy 
over his Chera and the Chola contemporaries He is also 
called Madurakarunatakan and Kongarkoman and these 
titles do not seem to have been empty boasts but the 
index of substantial military achievements which appear 
to have had a wide range , for he is said to have attacked 
and subdued the Maharathas in the great city of Mangala- 
puram which seems to have been no other than the 
modern Mangalore 2 It must, however, be noted that the 

1 See Krishna Sastn criticizing Venkayya in El, vol svii, pp 296-7 
The view we take of this commentary has already been indicated 
It seems to be utterly useless to the historian The date of its 
composition must be later than the latest event mentioned in the illustrative 
stanzas, and the mention of Vilinam will thus take it to the close of the 
eighth or early ninth century A D And It is quite possible that a 
rhetoncal work like this took for its hero a saintly king of legendary fame, 
and attributed to him all the achie\ements of the Pandyan line of kings 
that the author could think of m his day 

z Dubreuil who did not have the test of the VElvikkudi grant before 
him quotes Mr Venkayya’s summary of this part of the grant and asks in 
astonishment, * This victory at Marudur, this ocean of enemies this 
Maharatha , what are all these ?’ ( The Fallows, p 68 ) The suggestion he 
makes in the nest paragraph on the same page that Koccada 3 ’an must have 
fought against Chalukya Vikramaditya I when the latter was encamped 
near Tnchinopoly is hard to accept in the face of the definite statement m

of the same grant ascribes to him a senes of victories at

lur, Kodumbalur and another place (whose name is not

of his splendoui at Kujumbur where the Pandya captured 
numberless elephants and horses from his enemy’s forces

the Pand)an version of the campaigns which led to the 
siege of Nandivarman Pallavamalla in Nandigrama by 
the Tamil prince^ which was raised by the victorious 
general of the Palla\a King, Udayacandra by name, who 
von several successes against his foes as narrated in the

suggested that the Pandya king espoused the cause of a 
son of Paramesvaravarman 1 1 who was kept out of his 
throne b) the usurper Nandivarman Pallavamalla and that 
this Pandjan interference in Pallava disputes may be 
traced to a marriage connection which Koccadayan con- 
tracted with a Pallava princess. 1 However that may be, 
there seems to be little reason to doubt that Maravarman 
Rajasimha Pandya I was the contemporary and opponent 
of Pallavamalla Now', turning to his campaigns else- 
where, we find that he defeated his foes at a place called

subjection gave his daughter m marriage to the Pandyan 
king From the Malava country Rajasimha proceeded to 
Pandikkodumudi where he ‘worshipped the lotus feet of 
Pasupati and gave away with great pleasure heaps of 
gold and lustrous gems 1 This perhaps means that the 
conquests of the Pandyan king extended up to Kodumudi. 
We also learn that he contracted relationship vhth the 
Ganga king The details of this transaction are given 
later on in the Velvikkudi plates in narrating the achieve- 
ments of Marangan, the U'jnapti of the grant. We learn 
that this Marangan was aided by Purvarajar (eastern 
kings) in a big fight at Venbai m which the powerful 
Vallabha king was beaten when the Ganga pnncess 
was secured and offered in marriage to the Pandyan 
prince who is referred to as Kongarkon and who 
may have been the son of Rajasimha by the Malava 
pnncess It is not easy to explain satisfactorily the 
political transactions referred to m this account. Mr.’x 
Krishna Sastn has observed, * The information that a , 
Ganga princess was married with the Pandya family is . 
not mentioned in any of the Ganga records of this penod 
which falls into the reign of ^lvamara I (A.D. 755-65). 
The Vallabha or the Western Chalukya king who was 
defeated on this marriage occasion was probably Kirtti- 
varman II, who succeeded to the Chalukya throne in A.D. 
746 or 747, and whose army is stated in his records to 
have defeated the army of the Keralas, the Cholas and 
the Pandyas ’ 1 It is clear that much still remains

and it would appear that much of the fighting was under- 
taken against the same old foes as had opposed his 
father in his northern wars. There is some reason to 
believe, however, that the victory of Nedunjadayan was 
at many points more complete than that of his father and 
that his campaigns had, speaking relatively, somewhat 
more permanent results He fought at Vellur/Vmnam 
and Jaeliyakkudi against foes about whose identity 
nothing is known. He put to flight Adigan of the 
bright lance in the two battles of Ayiraveh Ayirur and 
Pugaliyur on the north banks of the Kaveri and captured 
his chariot together with several of his war horses. In 
his war against the Pandya king, Adigan was aided 
by the Pallava and the Kerala whose forces .advanced 
from the east and the west and were repulsed with great 
loss by the opposing Pandyan forces Evidently as a 
result of these campaigns, the king of Western Kongu was 
captured with his elephants and sent into confinement 
within the walls of the Pandyan capital Madura and the 
whole of the Kongu country came under Pandyan rule. 
It is well known that a family of chieftains named Adi- 
gans or Adigamans ruled from Tagadur (Dharmapun ) 1 
m the Kongu country. We may take it that the Adigan 
who was repulsed at Ayirur and Pugaliyur was a feuda- 
tory of the Western Kongu chief who fought against the 
Pandya on behalf of his master and the appearance of 
the Kerala and Pallava forces in the campaigns may be 
explained as the result of a combined effort of the other 
three chief powers of the Tamil land to set some limit to 
the growing aggression of the Pandyas . 2 The coalition

apparently failed and as a result there was a considerable 
extension of the territories under Piindyan rule This 
extension seems to have been sufficiently permanent to 
allow the king to undertake the construction of a temple 
of considerable Size (qkjt,® Lanre^Q^/r/r G'airuQeo) to 
Visnu in a place called Kanjivaypperur which seems 
to have been m the Kongu country. 1 Perhaps the in- 
scriptions at Trichinopoh (414 of 1904) and Amba- 
samudram (105 of 1905), dated m the eleventh and the 
sixteenth years of the king may be taken as records 
connected with the wars we have just described The 
Trichinopoly inscription refers to the destruction of 
Vembil and the king’s encampment at Niyamam in the 
eleventh .vear The Ambasamudram record contains a 
gift made five yeais later from the king’s camp at 
Arasuronthe banks of the Pennai m the Tondainad. It 
may be mentioned, by the way, that though this king is 
called ‘ paiaviavatsuavttJi ' in the Museum plates and 
builds a temple to Visnu m Kanjivaj pperur, he does 
appear to have been quite ready to encourage Saivite 
temples and endow them richly 2 The Trichinopoly

1 Mr Venkayya was naturall} in great difficulty in 1893 when he tried to 
identify the places mentioned in the Madras Museum plates But he spent 
great ingenuity over the names Kanknbhumi and Kanjivaypperur and tried 
to connect them with Tiruhknluhhunram and Knnchipuram (7 A ,

and Ambasamudram inscriptions just referred to may be 
quoted in evidence of this , a record of the thirteenth 
year of the king (155 of 1903) found at Tiruccendur 
mentions a considerable endowment from the proceeds , 
of which the cost of regular worship in the temple of 
Kumara all the year round was to be met. Yet another 
inscription of the thirty-ninth year (104 of 1905) 0 records 
the gift of three lamps to the god TiruppSttudaiya 
Bhatarar of Ambasamudram. 

The Museum plates also mention that Nedunjadayan 
conquered the king of Venad (South Travancore) and 
captured large numbers of his elephants and horses along 
with his treasures and his country In the campaign 
that led to this annexation, the strongly fortified port of 
Vilmam was attacked and destroyed by the Pandyaij, 
forces Vilmam seems to have been a great and flourish- 
ing emporium which often roused the cupidity of the 
foreign invaders of Travancore , it would appear to have^ 
recovered rapidly after each disaster that befell it, for we ^ 
find it still forming the subject of attack by the Chola y 
emperors three centuries after the days of Nedunjadayan 
The first conquest of Venad thus referred to in the 
Museum plates must have taken place before the 
seventeenth year of the king’s rule It was soon after 
this conquest that the king undertook the task of strong- 
ly fortifying Karavandapuram (which has been identified 
with the village of Kalakkad in the Tinnevelly district) 
perhaps because it was on the frontier of the newly 
conquered country At any rate Venad does not seem 
to have accepted this conquest as final, and we have 
evidence in the Trivandrum Museum stone inscription \ 
(277 of 1895) that the king was still fighting 0 m the ' 
neighbourhood of Vilmam more than ten years after his 
first invasion. It may also be noted that another

Varaguna is that of the date of Manikkavasagar. 
Before the discovery, about 1906, of the larger Sinnama- ( 
nur plates and other records there was only one Varaguna 
known, and that was the king of the legend of the vision 
of Sivalokam in the TiruvilaiyUdal. And this reference 
to a Varaguna did not help Very much in deciding the age 
of the Saiva saint who refers to the king in the r Tiruk- 
kovaiyar , but since two Varagunas became available to 
history from the new epigraphical finds, several scholars 
have, with great eagerness, sought to fix the age of 
Manikkavasagar by identifying the Varaguna mentioned 
by him with one or the other of these kings. But it does 
not seem that this epigiaphical short cut to the date of 
this saint is m any way better supported than that other 
effort to fix the age of the £angam from the references in 
the Velvikkudi grant which we have seen no reason to 
accept as satisfactory. But it is not possible to pursue 
the question of the age of Manikkavasagar at any 
length here , it can only be stated that there are serious' 
difficulties in the way of assigning Manikkavasagar to 
the reign of either of these kings in the eighth or the 
ninth century A. D. and that the Varaguna Pandya referred 
to in the TirukkdvaiyUr must still be taken to be the 
Varaguna of legend about whom, as yet, we do not know 
anything more than is contained in that story 1

Studies, pp 401 ff and contrast. Pandit V Swaminatha Aiyar in his

m the Tamilian Antiquary The arguments of Mr Sesha Aiyar seem to 
be complete as a refutation of the eplgraphists’ position, and Mr Pillai 
approaches the question of the date of the saint from a different stand- 
point, that of the Christian Church in Malabar

the following JtfSniiAfcnratwSK. rinmt nioirtJ that the miracle of the

transformation of foxes Into horses was performed by {§ivan on his account 
(«go£D ^esrt-irGsr) in Tint PonnfiSal , 1 45 , also Tint Ammdnat, 11 17-18 , 

• TiruvSrttai, 11 14-15 and AttatiadatnSlat, 11 25-26, to save him from the 
consequences of his master’s wrath And Appar, by general consent the 
earliest of the three Tevaram hymnists, does refer to this miracle and also to 
a VScaka m a manner which seems to leave no room for doubt that it is a 
reference to our saint Then there is the fact that in all the traditional lists 
of Pandya Kings, the contemporary of Manikka\ aSagar is placed several 
generations before Kun Pandya, the contemporary of Gnanasambandar It 
must also be noticed that MapikkavaSagar’s life and history occupy a rather 
eajlier, and perhaps more conspicuous place in the cycle of the Madura 
sports of Sivan and that it has not been possible to recognize so far any 
clear eplgraphical references except to the last of the kings in the lists gi\ en 
in the different versions of these stones It seems a natural inference from 
all this that Man i k k a vaSagar, the antagonist of Buddhism, was older than 
the saints of the age of Sambandar whose chief contests appear to have 
been with the Jams 

The chief argument against this conclusion has generally been found in 
the absence, of any reference to MapikkavaSagar m the catalogue of £aiva 
saints (Tirutlondattogai) given by Sundaramurti, who may be taken to have 
lived within a century of Gnanasambandar, the contemporary of Arikesan 
ParankuSa in the late seventh century This may have been an accident, 
and at best an argument from silence cannot be pressed far But Mr 
Sesha Aiyar has pointed out with great plausibility that the expression 
* QuirtuvLfLeaLDuSeooirp L/eoeuir ’ in Sundara’s list of saints does refer to our 
saint as it fits in very well with the traditional history of his life and doings. 
Those who hesitate to accept this suggestion are influenced by the authority 
of Nambi Andar Nambi and his successors, who have regularly followed 
him in interpreting this expression as a reference to the poets of the Madura 
Sangam Great as must be the authority of Nambi and his successors in 
matters of religion and theology, I have no hesitation in declaring with 
Mr Sesha Aiyar that the history involved in their interpretation of the 
Tiruitondattogai seems to be, much of it, wrong The point is that con* 
tinuity in religious tradition seems to be quite compatible with a break in 
secular historical tradition. For an illustration I may refer to the case of 
another saint m the list, ^eruttupai, who is spoken of as a king of Tanjore 
by Sundaramflrti , Nambi makes no mention of his having been a king at 6 
all, evidently because in his day nothing was known about such a ruler of a 
Tan] ore , and a little later, Sekkilar m his Penyapur&nam actually makes a 
VaiSya (Ceier/iwgjif. Qpfitxxutr) of this king of Tanjore S 

My conclusion therefore is that MapikkavaSagar must be taken to have 
preceded the Tevdram Tno and that once more epigraphy, despite the great 
advancej it has made in recent years, fails to establish the large claims 
made on its behalf in the matter of settling beyond possibility of doubt the 
chronology of early South Indian History 



CHAPTER VI 

THE FIRST EMPIRE —{Continued ) 

THE son and successor of Parantaka Nedunjadayan 
alias Varaguna was Sri Mara Srlvallabha whose reign 
may be taken to have extended from, say, A.E. 815 to 
A.D 862. He also had the birudas Ekavira and Fata • 
cakrakolahala . All that we know of this king is derived 
from the larger Sinnamanur plates. From the way 
these plates begin to furnish rather important historical 
data from this point onward, it would almost appear that 
the composer of this inscription had the Velvikkudi 
grant before him and avoided, by design, dwelling on the 
events already recorded in that grant. However that 
may be, what we learn about Sri Mara Srlvallabha 
goes to show that he succeeded not only in maintaining 
the power handed down to him by his father, but even 
found it possible to extend it to Ceylon The SanskriK 
part of our record tells us that this king brought the / 
whole world (a hyperbole for S India ?) under the pro-'" 
tection of his umbrella and became well-beloved of his 
subjects {P rent a- pu tram prajanani) after defeating in 
battle such diverse foes as the Mayapandya, the Kerala, 
the king of Simhala, the Pallava and the Vallabha The 
Tamil portion confirms this and adds further that the 
king won victories at Kunnur and Vihnam as well as 
in Ceylon, and that he repulsed with great loss a 
confederation of Gangas, Pallavas, Cholas, Kalingas, 
Magadhas and others who offered battle at Kudamukku 
or Kumbakonam. This victory would appear to have 
greatly increased the king’s military reputati&n and 
furnished the occasion for the high-sounding title 
P aracakrakoluhala. 



*THE FIRST EMPIRE 


69 


We seem to have no means of elucidating the refer- 
ences to the victory over the Kerala and the fight at 
Vihnam except by supposing that trouble from this 
quarter seems to have been more or less permanent and 
that the western country never reconciled itself to the 
yoke of its Pandya neighbour It is however possible 
to say ’something on the references to the conquest of 
Ceylon and the victory at Kudamukku over the Pallava. 
Ihe evidence of the Mahavam'sa confirms in some 
measure the statement in the Pandya grant regarding 
the conquest of Ceylon 1 According to that chronicle 
there was a Pandya invasion of Ceylon during the reign 
of the Singhalese king Sena I The Pandyan victory 
in the battle fought at Mahatalita was complete ‘ and 
the army of king Pandu spread destruction all over the 
land 1 The Singhalese king fled from his capital and 
took refuge in the Malaya country Prince Mahinda, the 
‘ sub-king ’ committed suicide and was followed by 
others in this act and prince Kassapa, after an exhibition 
of personal valour, also fled The Pandya forces took 
possession of the capital, carried away a large amount 
of booty ‘ and made Lanka of none value whatsoever * 
and eventually the Pandya king entered into a treaty 
with the fugitive king of Ceylon restoring the country to 
him. After this, the chronicle records a counter-inva- 
sion of the Pandya country by the Singhalese m the 
reign of their next king Sena II. And this throws some 
light on the Mayapandya, the Pandya pretender of the 
Pandyan inscription When Sena II was preparing for

tions considers only chap li of the Ceylon accounts

a counter-attack on the Pandyas, ‘ it came to pass that 
at that very time a prince of the royal family of Pandu f 
was come hither, having formed a design to overthrow 
that kingdom because he had been ill-treated by his 
king ’ (li. 27). Sena II allied himself with the rebel 
Pandya prince and invaded the mainland and succeeded 
m besieging the very capital of the Pandyas. The king 
of the Pandyas ‘ fled from the field of battle on the back 
of an elephant, and gave up his life in the wrong place 
And his queen also died with him at the same time ’ 
(li. 38) 1 The Singhalese took possession of the city, 

crowned the Pandya pnnce who had sought their help 
and returned to Ceylon with a large amount of booty 
including the treasures carried away by the ••Pandyas 
when they invaded Ceylon ’ (Venkayya) 

This narrative of events given in the Mahavam'sa 
cannot all of it be accepted as history First as to 
chronology The traditional dates for Sena I and Sena Ik 
are A D. 846 to 866 and A.D. 866 to 901. We have 
assigned to fsrlmara, roughly, A.D. 815-862 so that the 
counter-invasion from Ceylon would fall in the reign of 
the successor of fsrlmara , but it is not possible to accept 
this arrangement, if we propose to identify the Pandya 
prince who appealed to Sena II and the Mayapandya 
who was conquered by Srimara. It has been pointed 
out that a correction of twenty-four years must be in- 
troduced into the MahcLvanisa chronology of this period 
in the light of the established dates of South Indian 
history with special reference to the early Cholas of the 
Vijayalaya line. 1 This correction will give the dates

does not discuss chaps 1 and li, a rather strange omission in an otherwise 
complete study of the synchronisms between Singhalese and South Indian 
biitory

822 to S42 and 842 to S77 roughly for the reigns of Sena 
t I and Sena II and thus reconcile the chronology of the 
narrative in the Mahavamsa with that of Srlmara’s reign 
as fixed by independent evidence. But then there are 
other difficulties as well The Pandyan side of the evid- 
ence makes the ruling king successful in repelling a Maya- 
pandya and thus keeping his throne to himself at the end 
of the struggle , the Ceylon account makes out a disaster 
of the first magnitude to the Pandyan kingdom from the 
story of the counter-invasion undertaken by Sena partly 
in support of the Pandya prince There is no possibility 
of reconciling these accounts , one of them must be 
rejected as untrustworthy Now, on the face of it, it 
seems impossible to suppose that such a serious disaster 
befell the Pandya power m the reign of Srimara and 
that the Sinnamanur plates suppressed the truth or 
deliberately gave a false account of the reign. On the 
other hand, the Mahavamsa is a highly embellished and 
poetic account of the history of Ceylon. 1 And one 
cannot help feeling that in this chapter of the Mahavamsa 
some transactions belonging to a later age (twelfth 
century A D.) have been repeated perhaps to take off the 
edge from the story of the conquest of Ceylon by 
the Pandya king, narrated a little earlier. When we 
come to the Pandyan civil wars of the twelfth century m 
which Ceylonese kings oftep interfered, we shall see that 
the Mahavamsa persistently colours the account favour- 
ably to the Ceylonese kings and commanders Our 
conclusion, therefore, is that Srimara did carry out a 
successful raid against Ceylon and that he repulsed 
the attempt at retaliation brought about partly by the 

1 See I A , vol sxxv, pp 1S3 ff, for translation of an important 
criticism of this book and other Ceylon chronicles by Geiger

THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 


intrigues of an impostor, about whose identity nothing 
is known at present . 1 

1 Mr Venkayya remarked (p 56, A RE , 190S) of fklmara ' As he is 
also said to have conquered Mayapandya, who must have belonged to his 
own family, there is enough evidence that there were internal dissensions 
among the Pandyas already In his reign ’ , and In this he has been followed 
by M Dabreull But I do not think that Mayapandya means c ‘ a person 
belonging to the Pandya family ’ , If anything it means just the contrary, 
and does not support tho inferences of Venknyya about internal dissensions 
which are far-fetched indeed We cannot of course get nny light on this 
matter from the Ceylon account , for any Impostor, to make himself nccepted 
in Ceylon, must have claimed kinship with the Pandya ruling family Vcn 
kayya again is not any way more fortunate in his attempts to identify this 
Mayapandya He says {ibid) ‘In this connection it is worthy of note 
that the relationship of No 11 (my number 9) Varagunnvnrraan to his pre 
decessoris not given in the Tamil portion of r thc larger Sinnnmanur plates, 
while the Sanskrit portion of the same plates mention the relationship only 
indirectly No 12 (my number 10) Parantaka is said to have been the 
younger brother of Varaguna and the son of Srimarn Consequently it is 
not impossible that it was Varagupa who sought help from the Singhalese 
in order to secure the Pandya throne ’ Mr Venkayya appears in this case 
to have relaxed his usual standards about evidence in lus anxiety to discover 
the identity of Mayapandya His whole argument turns upon the Tamil 
portion not mentioning the relationship of Varagunavarman to hi^ 
predecessor and the Sanskrit portion mentioning it only indirectly The 
Tamil portion not only fails to mention relationships, in other cases, but 
omits all reference to Jatila Parantaka , the Sanskrit portion mentions the 1 ” 
relationship, but only 1 indirectly ’ I am unable to see any logic in the 
inferences made by Mr Venkayya from this supposed 1 indirectness’ 
Personally I am of opinion that much trouble might be avoided if the 
epigraphists give up the habit of treating the integral parts of one inscrip- 
tion in different languages as altogether different inscriptions There is 
enough indication in the inscription that Varagunavarrunn ruled in his turn 
and enjoyed a fairly prosperous reign This is the text 

* @*to sratppatr (vpieOiuns parptr&Qar euewrc/iwii/ tfiraflQwO/j 

maresrirdsnar wir^ssaromuissUD 1 

But Mr Venkajya is not himself satisfied with the result he irrives at 
He continues ‘ There is still another alternative No 12 Parantaka is said 
to have seized a certain Ugra, apparently in the battle of Kharagiri It may 
be that this Ugra was a Pandya prince with whom the former had to fight 
for the throne ’ This makes matters worse This Parantnka did not reign 
till after lus brother’s defeat at Sri Purambiyam , his brother rulecf at least 
eight years from the close of his father’s reign , and it is not clear how any- 
thing that took place in the reign or just before the accession of Parantaka 
II can throw any light on the identity of Mayapandya whom his father dealt 



THE FIRST EMPIRE

When we turn next to study the circumstances of Sri- 
.rnara’s success at Ivudamukku, we get some light from 
the Pal lava records of the period. Two facts are estab- 
lished be)ond the range of doubt. Fust, Ivudamukku 
is Kumbakonam as this name is given to the place 
in a record of the eighth year of Maranjadayan, most 
probably, Srlmara’s famous father Second \ the Pandya 

power was in this period fan ly well established in the 
heart of the Tanjore district though there were frequent 
conflicts with Pallava forces across a shifting frontier in 
this direction , 1 the permanence of the Pandya occupation 
of this territory being shown by the presence of many 
Pandya inscriptions of this period in several places in the 
Tanjore 'district From the provenance of the inscrip- 
tions of Nandivarman III it seems to be a reasonable 
inference that this contest continued through his reign 
with varying fortune It seems not unlikely that the 
famous fight from which Nandi came to be known as 
Tellarerinda Nandi occurred in the course of these 

with j ears before The fact is, we know at present nothing more about 
both Majapandya and Ugra than wlint is mentioned of them in the Sinna- 
maniir plates and it is best to sny so 

Mr Vcnknjjanlso adds * If the story of the MaMvavtSa be true, the 
discontented Pandya prince whether lie was Majnpnndyn or Ugra Pandya 
must ha\e been on the PaDdjan throne for sometime before he was 
replaced by No 12 Parantnka * Inin unable to concede that the story of 
the MahiivamSa is true or that there «n?nn interruption in the regular succes- 
sion recorded m the Sinmronnur -plates See howeier, K V S Aiyar,

1 I may note here that I am not following M Dubreuil ’s arrangement by 
which Varaguna is made the opponent of Nandi at Tellaru c 830 ad If 
the opponent of Nandi at TeJlaru was a Pandya, as perhaps he was (see 
Dubreuil, The Pallavas, pp 79-80) then he must have been Srimara It 
ma> aIso*e observed that Dubreuil seems to exaggerate the significance of 
Tejlaru when he writes that * this glorious enmpaign enabled him to reign 
peacefully not only nt Kanchl but also on the banks of the Kaveri ’ The 
poetry of the Nandikkalambakam should not be mistaken for history Contra

contests, and that in that battle Srfmara was the oppo- 
nent who was beaten in the fight with Nandi. This must, 
have been somewhere about A D. 830. The victory of 
Kudamukku won by fsrfmara against the Pallavas and 
their confederates must then be taken to fall in Nandi- 
varman’s reign It seems quite natural to connect this 
battle mentioned in the Pandya inscription witti another 
that is referred to in the Bahur plates of Nrpatunga- 
varman 1 who was the successor of Nandi of Tellaru and 
came to power about A.D. 854. In the Bahur plates it is 

1 1 follow the text of Mr Krishna Sastn as amended and translated by 
Gopmatha Rao , see Dubreml, The Pallavas , pp 47-50 But the verse is not 
easy and there is no means of controlling the readings Dr Hultzsch in his 
recent edition of the plates in the E I , vol xvih, pp 5 ff writes ‘ Of him 
(Nrpatunga) verse 16 tells us that he supplied a Pandya king, whose 
proper name is not disclosed, with an army, and that he defeated some 
enemies, who are not specified either, on the further bank of the 
Ancit river It may be concluded from verse 16 that Nrpatunga allied 
himself with a Pandya king and undertook an expedition into the domains 
of the Chola king ’ , and the text and translation as given by him support 
these statements Looking at the verse from the Pandyan side, it strikes ’ 
me that Mr Rao ’s translation supported by Mr Sastri’s text is the more pro-, 1 
bable , because (i) there seems to be little room for a Pandya-Pallava 
alliance m this period, (ii) the Cholas actually figure as the allies of the 
Pallavas in the ^innamanur plates and (in) it seems probable that inverse 
16 (Bahur) Kudamukku of the Sinnamanflr plates is referred to as having 
taken place before the accession of Nrpatunga (pur a) and mentioned as a 
sort of introduction to the reprisal that followed under Nypatunga on the 
banks of the Ancit It may also be that Nrpatunga fought as a pnnee 
before his accession 

M Dubreuil ( The Pallavas, p 71)- may or may not be nght in supposing 
‘ that the Pallava Nrpatunga profited by the invasion of the Pandya king 
dom by the Singhalese ’ , but he is clearly misquoting verse 17 of 
the Bahur plates m support of his theory of the alliance of Nrpatunga and 
Sena II, which, he says, ‘ seems to be confirmed by the Bahur plates which 
say that Nrpatunga’s fame bad spread beyond the seas as that of Rama ’ 
(italics mine) The text is 1 Khydto na Kcvalam Bhutn&vatnu$imtinapt 
Rdmaval ’ = famed not only on earth, but in other worlds like Rama I am , 
also unable to follow him when he says that Srlmara was defeated at 
Kumbakonam in the face of the definite statement in the Sinnamanur 
plates that Srimara repulsed a great confederation of his foes at Kuda- 
mukku See also his remarks under Nrpatunga at p 81 of bis Pallavas

said * The army (of the Pallavas) which on a former 
occasion sustained defeat at the hands of the Pandya, 
was, by the grace of this king (Nrpatunga, i.e. by being 
led by him), able to burn down the hosts of the enemies 
together with the prosperity of their kingdoms on the 
bank of the river Ancit ’ From this refeience it is not 
cleai whether Nrpatunga’s victory was won after he 
became ruler in his own right or earlier Nor do we get 
any indication as to the interval between the defeat of the 
Pal lava forces at the hands of the Pandya and the reta- 
liation under Nrpatunga on the banks of the Ancit 
The use of the phrase ' on a formei occasion ’ with 
reference to the Pandyan victory seems however to make 
it necessary to postulate some interval between the two 
engagements We may conclude then, that if Nandi of 
Tellaru began his reign with a victory against farimara, 
he lived long enough to sustain a defeat in his turn at 
Kudamukicu in spite of the fact that on this occasion he 
seems to have been supported by several of his allies , 
the tide turned once more against the Pandya on the 
accession of Nrpatunga whose youthful success at the 
Ancit — the river Ansil, a branch of the Kaven which 
enters the sea at Karaikkal, 1 is recorded in the Bahur 
plates as we have seen. 

The reign of fsrimara Srfvallabha then appeals to 
have been a mixed record of. success and failure The 
advent of an impostor to the throne, apparently aided in 
his rebellion by the Ceylonese troops, and the two 
defeats at Tellaru and the Ancit at the hands of the 
Pallavas are evidence that the empire has begun to

strain the resouices of the Pandya country, and the 
operations at Vilinam may perhaps be accepted as proof 
that the conquered lands are not settled on a permanent' 
basis and may assert then independence at the earliest 
opportunity But theie is no reason to doubt that 
Srlmara was a strong ruler who found it possible in the 
midst of so much trouble to maintain his powev intact 
and hand it down at his death to his elder son Varaguna- 
varman whose accession can be placed definitely in 
A.D. 862 

About this Varagunavarman we learn nothing more 
than his name from the Sinnamanur plates The only 
fact that can be referred to his reign with any amount of 
certainty is his fighting a great battle at £ri Purambiyam 
and losing it. It may also be that a record (690 of 1905) 
of Maranjadayan which incidentally mentions an expedi- 
tion against Idavai also belongs to the time of this 
ruler. 1 Idavai has been identified with a village of 
the same name in the Chola country referred to m Choks 
inscriptions of a slightly later date. At the battle of f^ri 
Purambiyam the Western Ganga king Pnthivlpati lost 
his life. 2 The latest date known for Pnthivlpati 3 is 
A.D. 879, so that the battle of Sri Purambiyam must be 
placed about A.D. 880 at the earliest, and Varagunavar- 
man must be taken to have reigned at least up to that 
date. Now thejlast incident we noticed in the long duel 
between the Pandyas and their neighbours in the north, 
the Pallavas, was the battle of the Ancit. After that 
battle Nrpatunga would appear to have had a peaceful 
time with the Pandyas who were for the rest of the reign

of Srlmara and for several years’ after the accession of 
Varagunavarman apparently compelled to recognize the 
’position Nrpatunga had established for himself by his 
early success It is also interesting to observe that it 
was during tins period that Vijayalaya captured Tanjore 
and made the city his own and it is not unlikely that the 
Cholas \and the Pallavas were on friendly terms in this 
period as the Sinnamanur plates imply After the 
death of Nrpatunga, when Ins successor Aparajita came 
to the Pallava throne about A D SSo, it would seem that 
Varaguna made an attempt to reassert the waning power 
of the Pandyas in Cholamandalam and Tondainad. The 
expedition against Idavat may well have been directed 
against the rising power of the Cholas. The king then 
ruling was probably Aditya I, the son of Vijayalaya, who 
came to the throne almost at the same time as his 
Pallava contemporary Aparajita. This attack on Idavai 
was apparently successful and Varaguna was enabled to 
carry his arms further north 1 he Pallava king Aparajita 
was aided on this occasion by his Ganga feudatory 
Prithivlpati I and the opposing forces of the Pandya and 
the Pallava had an encounter at fjrf Purambiyam identifi- 
ed with Tiruppurambiyam near Kumbakonam. 1 In this 

1 See ARE, 190G, pp 47-S I am unable to follow Mr Gopmatha Rao 
in bis statement ' It is known from other records that Aditya and the 
Pandya King Varaguna marched against the Pallava, Nrpatunga Varman, 
otherwise known also by the name of AparujitaVnrman, defeated and killed 
him’ (j£/,\ol sv, p 49) But see Dubreuil, The Pallavas, pp 83-4 I 
bolie\e inscription No 337 of 1912 does not mean that the Cholas were 
the friends of Varaguna The appearance of the Cholas nmong the oppo- 
nents of Srimara at KudamSkku and the expedition against Idavai strongly 
support the view that the Cholas were the friends of the Pallavas and the foes 
of the Pandyas till the battle of Sri Purambiyam Again, as Dubreuil points 
out, if Aparajita is only a pseudonym of Nrpatunga, there would be only 
one battle, that of Sri Purambiyam Then we shall have to assume that at 
this battle Aparajita was beaten by Aditya as mentioned in the Tiruvalan- 
gadu plates of RSjendra , but this is contradicted by the Udayendiram

battle although the Western Ganga king Pnthivlpati I 
lost his life, still victory was with Aparajita and the^ 
Pandya advance was rolled back. It may be that Aditya , 
I (the Chola) was also on the side of Aparajita and was 
able to get for himself some of the territory gained by 
the confederates on the repulse of the Pandyan invader. 
All this must have been m A.D. 880 or very soon after. 

Varagunavarman does not appear to have long survi- 
ved the defeat at Sn Purambiyam He seems to have 
died childless and was followed on the throne by 
his younger brother fsri Parantaka alias Viranarayana 
fsadayan Three verses m,the Sanskrit part of the 
Smnamanur plates state (1) that he captured single- 
handed the haughty Ugra near Kharagin together with 
his elephants whose tusks were reeking of the blood of 
opposing forces killed in battle, (11) that this pious king 
endowed many agraharas , and numberless devasthanas 
and tatdkas , and (111) that he had for his queen Sri Vanavan 
MahadevI who resembled LaksmI and Indram, the.^ 
consorts of Visnu and Indra. The Tamil account j 
generally confirms these statements and says further 
that he destroyed Pennagadam and fought in the 

plates of Prithivlpati II which state that victory in Sri Purambiyam was 
with Aparajita and that Varagupa was beaten in the battle The verse may 
be quoted 

It is not likely that, if Varaguna was beaten, and Aditya was his friend in 
this battle, Aditya got the whole of the Pallava country 01 even a part of it 
as a result of this fight On the other hand if Aditya helped Aparajita in 
his victory, he might have claimed a share of the spoil and later on proceed- 
ed to make the other attack which transferred the Pallava dominions to him - 1 - 
as the Tiruvalangikju plates imply And this, m my opinion, is wW hap 
pened actually I am unable to see why Dubreuil must place Sri Puram- 
biyam in Njpatunga’s reign or ' admit that Nrpatunga was killed in the 
battle of Jarl Purambiyam ’ (p 83).

Kongu countr} It is not possible, in the present state 
of our knowledge, to attempt to elucidate the battle 
of Kharagin, the destruction of Pennagadam and the 
fight in Kongu. The last two events may be taken 
as some evidence that, though hard pressed by its foes, 
the Pandya power was still struggling to maintain itself 
in foreign lands And the name of the queen sug- 
gests that she was a Chera princess, and it may be 
tentatnel} assumed that the name of Seravanmahadevi, 
a flourishing little towm adjacent to the raihvay station 
Shermadevi in the Tmnevelly district, has some connec- 
tion with the name of this queen Perhaps this marriage 
is also some indication that, for one reason or another, 
the reign of this king was marked by happier relations 
with the Chera kings than w r as usual in this age. We 
may assign conjccturally the last twenty years of the 
ninth century as the period of this king’s rule 

Parantaka Viranarayana was succeeded on the throne 
by his son by VanavanmahadevI, Maravarman Raja- 
simha II, the donor of the larger Sinnamanur plates, 
the discovery of w'hich has meant the recovery, to a very 
large extent, of the Pandya history of this period This 
grant is dated in the sixteenth year of the king’s reign 
and it is likely that he reigned some years after. His 
rule may therefore be taken to have extended from about 
A D 900 to about 920 or a little later The Sanskrit 
part of the record of the king’s reign though it comprises 
four fair-sized 'sloLas contrives to tell us just nothing 
about the king or his achievements as a ruler The 
Tamil account vies with the Sanskrit in fulsome flattery 
of the^ king, but happens to mention a few facts But 
the obscurity of the diction and the gaps in the text 
render it extremely difficult to be sure of the ground 
With this caution, it may be noted that a battle at 



THE PANDyAN KINGDOM 


Ulappihmangalam is mentioned, another fight with 
Tanjayarkon (the king of Tanjore) and perhaps also an, 
attack on Vanji 1 We learn also that the king had the 
titles — Vikalapatava, ^rikanta, Rajasikhamani and 

Mandaia Gauiava Among his foundations arc men- 
tioned numberless Palliccandams which seem to be Jain 
temples or endowments in their favour. 

Rajasimha II, however, may be surel) identified 
with the Pandya King Rajasimha who is said to have 
been beaten by the Chola Parantaka I (i nde the Udayen- 
diram plates of PnthivTpati II 2 ) and this fact enables us 
to get some light on his fortunes from the records of the 
contemporary Chola monarch. This king Parantaka I 
Chola came to the throne in A.D. 907. 3 Before his

Pallava Aparajita who seems to have lost the bulk of his 
terntor) to his new foe It is not unlikely that Aditya, 
late in his lifetime, undertook a campaign against his 
southern neighbour and that this campaign furnished the 
occasion for his son calling himself lad hu ran taka or 
Maduraikonda This title of Parantaka appears as early 
as the third )earofhis reign, AD 910 The Pandya 
king Rajasimha had to look about for allies and he 
turned to Ceylon The ruler of Ceylon at the time w f as 
not unwilling to aid the Pandya king and sent an army 
to the mainland Rajasimha, so reinforced, made an 
effort to. letaliate on the Chola pow'er and invaded the 
Chola country , and thus began the second w r ar which 
Parantaka fought against the Madura troops A deci-

of the proximity (of the Chola dominions to Ceylon).’ 
The Tiruvalangadu plates are no less explicit and more t 
graphic in the account they give 1 

This was the ruin of Rajasimha and the empire that 
had been reared by generations of his ancestors Madura 
was lost and Rajasimha had to flee to Ceylon. There 
he made pitiful efforts to regain his fortune an'd, if we 
may follow the Mahavamsa account, which is confirmed 
by the later Chola inscriptions of Rajendra I, Rajasimha 
after some fruitless waiting despaired of gaining any- 
thing by his stay in Ceylon, left behind his crown and 
other regalia {thcLpetva makutadlni) and betook himself to 
the Kerala country, the home of his mother Vanavan- 
mahadevi {goto Klralasantikaiti). Such was the end of 
the First Empire of the Pandyas, whose political fortunes 
we have traced through these two chapters. These last 
scenes may be placed about A.D 920 

Parantaka I Chola made an attempt late in his 
reign to capture the Pandya’s makuta from the Ceylonese 
ruler and failed ( c . A.D. 943) , but this was actually 
accomplished later by the more fortunate Rajendra. 





CHAPTER VII 


THE FIRST EMPIRE — ( Concluded) 

The history of the Pandyan kingdom in the period 
between the restoration after the Kalabhra occupation 
and the .fall of Madura before Parantaka eaily in the 
tenth century, as made out by us so far, cannot by any 
means be regarded as either final or complete Only the 
barest outlines of the story have been tiaced Many 
points have had to be left unsettled , others have been 
noted as points for future study in the light of further 
evidence that may become available We have also had 
to pass by a large number of stone inscriptions dated in 
the regnal years of Maran Sadayan and Sadayan Maran 
which undoubtedly belong to this period, but cannot 
with certainty be assigned to particular rulers. If we 
know so little about the mam line of the Pandyas, our 
knowledge about their subordinates and feudatories is 
even more limited Passing references have been made 
already to the local chieftains known as Vels, of whom 
the chiefs of the family of Ay seem to have enjoyed a 
long spell of power and influence m the mountainous 
country between the Tmnevelly district and Travan- 
core The Adigans of the Kongu country also felt the 
strength of the Pandyan kings and were forced for a 
—time to acknowledge their supremacy Somewhat more 
prominent than these chieftains seem to have been the 
Muttarayar 1 who have left behind several epigraphical 
records which have only been partially studied till now. 
It is certain that these rulers held large portions of the

Tanjore and Tnchinopoly districts and possibly parts of 
Pudukkottah for several generations and that the centre, 
of their power was somewhere in the district of Tanjore. 
Sendalai, at present a small village near Tnukkattupalli, 
appears once to have been a flourishing town with the 
beautiful name Candralekha, and either this place or 
Niyamam mits neighbourhood was most probably the 
centre of Muttaraya rule. There is even now m exis- 
tence a village by name Muttarasanallur within five 
miles of Tnchinopoly It is well known that a Peru- 
muttarayan is mentioned twice in the Naladiyar The 
inscriptions from the Sendalai pillars mention three 
continuous generations of the Muttarayar , the last of 
them was Suvaran Maran altos Perumbidugu Muttarayan 
who claims to have fought at many places on behalf of 
the Pallavas and against the Pandyas. There is also a 
curious coincidence in strange bvrtidas between these 
rulers and the Pallava kings — examples are Perum- 
bidugu and Videlvidugu These facts might lead one 
to suppose that these rulers were the subordinate allies of 
their Pallava contemporaries. On the other hand, there 
are other facts which seem to make it necessary to 
modify this conclusion. First, some kings of the Mutta- 
raya line date their records in their own regnal jears (i 8 
of Ilango Muttarayan in No 12 of 1899 from Sendalai). 
Secondly, one inscription ,(io of 1899) which records a 
gift by a servant of a Muttarayan is dated in the tentrf 
regnal year of Maranjadayan. And lastly, there is a gift 
by the queen of a Satrubhayankara Muttarayan recorded 
in a stone inscription in the Tinnevelly distnct and 
dated in the twenty-first regnal year of fsadayan Maran. 
(421 of 1906). In fact at one stage it was even supposed 
that the Muttarayar were a branch of the ruling house of 
the Pandyas and emphasis was laid on the recurrence of

is about all that we can gather on the military organization 
of the state in this period. One wonders if names like o 
Parantaka Vlrar are designations of particular regiments 
or groups of soldiers There does not seem to have been 
any rigid distinction between the civil and military 
services under the government, and in Marangari we get 
the instance of a versatile officer who was famed aflike for 
his services m war and as Uttaramantn and who was 
besides poet and orator. It seems likely that an expedi- 
tionary army was composed of troops brought together 
from several parts of the country each under its own 
leader, and we have instances of such leaders or the king 
himself, setting up permanent memorials celebrating the 
heroism of particular soldiers who distinguished them- 
selves above their compeers in war. Thus from the 
Kalugumalai record which refers to the expedition 
against laadayan Karunandan (43 of 1908) we learn that 
two soldiers did well in the storming of a fortress 
(Qsiri—emi— Kesris Q&ujgB ut—i—irtr) before they ^ 

fell, that they were in the household service (e_err afi 6 /-©® 
Q&n u9p G&euarr) of one Mangala Enadi alias Etti- 
mannan, and that this Enadi 1 made an endowment for 
the me^ntof these t\fro soldiers named Vinayantolu Suran 
and Sattan Nakkan. And again, the Trivandrum 
Museum stone inscription of the twenty-seventh year of 
Maranjadayan (277 of i895) o is a record of the fall of 
another warrior by name Ranakirti in the service of the" 
king before the fortress of Karaikkottai , and as this 
Ranakirti is said to have been a very loving servant of

the king, it is not unlikely that the king himself caused 
.this stone to be set up and engraved. 

The kings as a rule seem to have been very generous 
patrons of learning and the arts The few long epigraphs 
of this age that have come down to us furnish, by their 
poetic merit, clear proof of the high state of literary 
culture m the Sanskrit and Tamil languages in the 
Pandya country and are evidently compositions of court 
poets who were regularly maintained by the kings, The 
names of some of these composeis of pia'sastis have been 
preserved m the records These compositions which are 
recorded m the copper plates which register the more 
important royal grants are, as we have seen, the most 
important source for the general history of the rulers of 
this age , but they also furnish information on several 
minor matters of considerable interest to the student of 
social life We learn very casually from the Madras 
Museum plates that there was a colony of Brahmins from 
Magadha , and that they had a separate gramam set 
apart for them by name Sabdali and this may be accept- 
ed as some evidence that the south of India was in those 
days not isolated from the north as is sometimes 
thought. We are able to trace the prevalence of two 
subordinate divisions adapted evidently to local adminis- 
trative purposes. One of them is referred to as imdti 
or knrram and the Sanskrit part of the Sinnamanur 
grant even applies the term rostra to the same divi- 
sion The iiadu seems to have been the connecting 
link between the kingdom as a whole and the smallest 
unit of local administration which is referred to usually 
as grainam The names of grsmams usually end in 
inangalam , kudi and Hr and occasionally in vayal. 
The forms observed on the occasions when kings made 
gifts of whole villages are very interesting and deserve

some notice. The gift is always a danam in the reli- 
gious sense and is expressed usually by the phrase t 
£Qjnru.L-i^s 0 ^ir®^^n-€sr, which the Sinnamanur plates „ 
render into ambupurvam. The boundary of the village 
to be given away was generally fixed by following the 
beat of a female elephant that was let loose for the 
purpose as IS indicated by ‘ tMearesreuesr^] uassRajirei)

manur grant , and the boundary was marked by stones 
and live fences of kalll (ereoSso tuap&a SGigyiEi a6rr<sifliL]iM 
turn-iy.) and also clearly recorded in writing The grant 
was invariably engraved on copper plates and a high 
officer of state was entrusted with the task of drawing 
up and recording the anatti or royal order in pro- 
per form It is curious that the scribes are gener- 
ally the Perumbanaikkarans of the kings making 
the grant 1 All the gifts, when they did not go 
to temples, seem to have been in favour of Brahmanas { ' 
and the lands so granted to Brahmanas had a recognized 
legal status braJimadeyam This status is expressed in 
set phrases of which the following from the Madras 
Museum grant is a good example 1 i9jrim& Q^ajmirss

are technical terms as can be seen from the Sanskrit 
part of the Sinnamanur plates which keeps the terms asf 
such in the phrase ‘ Kuranmai miyUtci yutam samas- 
tam We have at present no means of fixing the exact

meanings of these terms. But as Kaianmai seems 
% etymologically connected with cultivation and MlyUta 
likewise with supervision and control, we may not be far 
wrong if we take the terms to indicate the rights of 
tenancy and landlordship respectively 1 The clear 
renunciation of all the rights of the donor contained in 
the phi’hse sat vafiai iharaviaka must also be noticed. 
When the gift has been completed the king generally 
requests his successors and every one that comes after 
him to respect his dana and this request is reinforced 
in the records by suitable quotations from the sacred 
laws ( Simti ) of the land One circumstance recorded 
in the Velvikkudi grant is of considerable importance 
and it is unfortunate that the meaning of the text here 
should not be clearer than it is The conditions under 
which this grant was made are very peculiar The donee 
claims that Velvikkudi was granted to his ancestors by 
an ancient Pandya king Kudumi and that this gift was 
cancelled by the Kalabhra interregnum and that this 
ought to be restored to him It is strange that this man 
should have waited for seven generations after the 
Pandyan restoration to reclaim the grant and at that late 
day should start by quarrelling with the king over the 
matter ( akrodhikka ) What followed must be related in 

the words of the grant 1 ereargu Stearpeuear eQ^^iru

here the king does not seem to have at first taken the

of the antiquity of the petitioner’s rights , but strangely 
enough, the proof was produced then and there, and the c 
king forthwith renewed the gift. The difficulty lies in 
our inability to understand min—Q in the passage cited 
above 1 But most probably it was only a general term 
for satisfactory evidence And the evidence that was 
produced in this case was most likely a written document 
which had just been found by the petitioner on tjie 
strength of which he made bold to press his suit in the 
manner indicated. 

The gramam was the unit of local administration as 
pointed out before, and there are enough indications 
to show that as a rule it was well able to take care of its 
affairs and that it inspired confidence m the king of the 
country by efficiency and rectitude m its conduct of 
affairs An inscription from Tiruccendur (26 of 1912) 
tells us that the king Varaguna Maharaja distnbuted 
among sixteen villages a large endowment he made to 
the local temple for meeting the cost of service in the-

blies But this is not the only difficulty If it was a reference to the district 
assembly, that ought to have been found easier to make soon after t K" 
Pandya restoration under KadungOn than so many generations after him, 
and we do not say why the petition was not made earlier Again the proof 
must have been such that (1) it was missed for long , (2) it was eapable of 
production before the king at a moment’s notice , and (3) it must have been 
so conclusive as evidence that the king was ready to accept it on the spot 
without any further enquiry The phrases in the text of the grant clearly, 
imply all this And these condibons are best satisfied by a written docu- 
ment like a copper plate grant— what shall we not pay to get this plate if 
that were possible ! I therefore propose to follow Mr K G Sankara and

kalanjus of gold foi the regular supply of ghi for the 
burning of four perpetual lamps and five other lamps in 
the temple of Tirumalai Bhatarar. This endowment 
was placed in fixed deposit with the Nagarattar of 
Sirrambar, and its proper administration was vested 
in the Pati of Sirrambar and the servants of the temple 
as trustees — [^suOsuiri—u^esr uiBai-Oiuuj ^iji—®Sljupp(^

(tpu >). 1 It may well be that the Nagarattar of Sirrambar 
were a corporation of merchants in the place , but it 
is not possible to say who the Pati was. He might have 
been the head of the corporation of merchants or a royal 
officer. The analogy of the Ilangokkudi-ccavai variyam 
points to the former alternative. It is very interesting 
to see that the kalanju mentioned in this record is the 
same as the gold tosu> the com being apparently descri- 
bed by its weight here , 2 we cannot however be sure of 
the exact weight of the kalanju itself in those days. A 
record in some respects more interesting than these

vants of the Pati 1 have followed the analogy of the Ambasamudram 
inscription in my rendering, as there seems to be no point in mentioning 
the servants of the Pati as trustees after mentioning the Pati himself as one 

1 The conclusion is the result of a simple calculation from the data 
given by this and the Ambasamudram record 'lvvo n&lis of ghi were to be 
given ever} day for four lamps to be maintained from the interest (Ouircfl) 
on 120 kalanjus (Tnchi mscr ) , the Ambasamudram records give the 
information 1 tiiilt of ghi = Mnillisoi paddy 'ihis will give 60 n&lts of paddy" 
every day as the cost of the service, this makes 2/3 of a kalam (=15 
kurnris = 90 nSlts, Venhayya in El) per day or roughly 240 kalams per 
year of 360 days, which is just the interest on 120 kalanjus ( k&ius ) at the 
prev ailing rate of 2 kalams per annum per k aiu ( Ka[anju ) This conclusion, 
it must be noted, casts a doubt on Venkayya’s rendering of un^m&tMcurci 
in the Trichinopoly record into ‘ weighed by the standard of the district’ If 
the calculation made in this note is accepted, it will be proof that the same 
standards prevailed all over the Pandya country at the time, which is not 
unlikely, in suen matters us the weight of the standard coin and the 
interest on perpetual royal endowments to temples

ance of the record Other inscriptions w r hich have been 
reviewed here tell us generally of the existence of village 
assemblies and of their carrying on their w r ork through 
committees And this Manur record may be taken 
perhaps as giving a type of the constitutions of village 
assemblies in this period in the south of the Pandya 
countr) Membership in the assembly was regulated by 
qualifications of property and learning very much as in 
the well-known inscriptions from Uttiramallur (Chinglc- 
put) of the earl) tenth century A D. There seems to have 
been no election to the assembly, but all important 
propert) interests w’ere represented on it. This seems 
to ha\e made the sabha a rather unwieldy body in 
which the transaction of business with reasonable 
despatch could only be secured by somewhat drastic 
rules against organued obstruction on the part of sections 
01 the members We learn nothing however as to the 
method of appointing the committee ( varvyam ) of the 
assembl) which formed the executive of the assembly,' 
each in its respective sphere of work 

\\ e maj now turn to a brief review of the state of 
religious belief in the period of our study We have 
seen that in the earl) centuries of the Christian era, in the 
Sangam age, Buddhism, Jainism and BrahminisnTiloun- 
shca in the Tamil land The central feature of the 
de\elopment that followed in the succeeding centuries

95 


was the determined effort made by the exponents of 
.Brahmmism in its various forms to suppress the hereti- 
cal sects of Buddhism and Jainism, an effort which was 
apparently marked by greater success against the 
Buddhists than against the Jams Yuan Chwang writing 
in the middle of the seventh century A.D deplores the 
decay of Buddhism in South India and envies the pros- 
perity of the Jains We can also tiace many survivals 
of Jainism to a comparatively late age At Ervadi in 
the Tinnevelly district there was discovered a squatting 
Jama figure and engraved below it is a small inscription, m 
Vattcluttu characters of about the eighth century A D , 
which reads ‘ Work of Ajjanandi This Jama teacher 
appears to be referred to in the Jlvakacintcimam also 
Another inscription m the same place of about the same 
period records a grant of land to a Jaina temple 1 Two 
inscriptions of Maranjadayan from the Ramnad district 
(430 and 431 of 1914) make mention of Tirukkattampalli 
which seems to have been a Jama temple at Kurandai, an 
important Jaina centre m Venbunadu 2 And the well- 
known Aivarmalai record of A.D 870 records the renewal 
of the images of Parsva-Bhatarar and the Yaksis at 
Tiruvayirai by one Santivlraguiavar, the pupil of Guna- 
vlrakkuravadigal And even Rajasimha II, the last of 
the Pandya rulers of this age, is said to have endowed, 
among others, several Jaina temples (erem as&pmp uetT 6 ifl& 
It is clear from such facts that Jainism 
was not overwhelmed so completely as Buddhism by the 
rising tide of fsaivism and Vaisnavism in the land 

A detailed study of the various movements of this 
heroic age of religion in South India is outside the 
scope of this history. But some attention must be given

THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 


to that part of the legendary accounts of the age which 
centres round Madura and the Pandya country, and^ 
an attempt made to estimate the influence of the revival of 
Hinduism on the Pandya country We have seen some 
reason to think that Manikkavasagar, the great antago- 
nist of Buddhism, was among the earliest of the great 
saints of this age. It is very likely that the period of 
his ministry was sometime before the restoration of the 
Pandya rule under KadungSn This fervid devotee of 
Ibiva had his birth in the Pandya country, and started in 
life as a high officer of the Pandya king , the scene of his 
chief triumphs against the Buddhists was Chidambaram, 
and there is some reason to think that the Pandyan 
power extended to Chidambaram in his day. It is 
remarkable that the sage ends his contest with the 
Buddhists by admitting the discomfited opponents into 
the fold of Saivism and that as Pope has observed ‘ no 
mention is made of the use of any violent measures 
The greatest achievement of the sage, — this is true also 
of many others like him in this period — was the propaga- 
tion of his faith by means of fervid popular songs 
which were unique in their lyrical beauty and the simp- 
licity and directness of their appeal to the human heart. 
The name of Tirugnanasambandar, whom Saivites regard 
as the greatest of Saiva saints of this age, is connected 
with the story of a miraculous cure worked on a Pandya 
king who may be identified, as we have seen, witfT* 
Ankesari Parankusa, who ruled in the second half of the 
seventh century A D Later legend makes the ocaasion a 
turning point in the history of orthodox £divism in the 
Pandya country The king was a Jam and the whole,, 
land was taking to the heretical doctrine after him , and 
it was only the devotion of the queen, who was a Chola 
princess, and the minister Kulaccirai that saved the

situation by sending word to the ’great saint of Shiyali 
begging him to come and reclaim the land by combating 
\, the Jains and putting an end to their influence ovei the 
king It is needless to narrate the story of what 
followed, as it is sufficiently known But it must be 
stated that there is little ground for the view that many 
Jains wei*e put to a cruel death on the occasion. The 
Tamil Pini iims indeed say that 8,000 Jains were 
impaled on stakes , but this seems apcfcryphal At any 
rate the saint Sambanda does not seem to be connected 
with the employment of violent measures and what 
troubles the Jains experienced seem to have been at the 
hands of the secular power 1 Indeed, at the end of the 
contest with the Saiva saint, we learn that the Jams still 
continued defiant, and unlike the Buddhist opponents of 
Manikkavasagar at Chidambaram, these Jains of Madura 
refused to embrace the faith of their victorious opponent 
when he invited them to do so 

The contest against the heretical sects was earned 
an by the Vaisnava Alvars as much as by the Saiva 
Nayanars But the history of the Alvars is even more 
Dbscure than that of the Nayanars and it is not possible 
to say much of any of them with confidence. We 
have noted before the attempt to fix the age of 
Madhurakavi and his Guru Nammalvar by identifying 
Madhurakavi-alvar with the ijnnister Marangan who is 
nsb called Madhurakavi in the Anamalai inscription It 
has also been supposed that Nammalvar (Kan Maran) 
was the* son of the minister and that ‘ he may have 
given his own father’s surname Madhurakavi to his

disciple as a dasyanUma 11 But, however plausible 
such assumptions may be, they are still only assump c - 
tions which await some tangible proof. The suggestion 
has been made that another Vaisnava saint, Periyalvar, 
was the contemporary of Jatila Parantaka I 2 Periyalvar 
does refer to a Pandya king Nedumaran in the 
lines. 1 (0<E/r)6&r63rs06O 3k.irQ&jpQsirenr Ot^QiMrrpear Qpssr 
&L-U-.p(S&irm OpearGo rear 0ff/r«rar/_/T©U) OpGsr/dlQ^LDrreQQ^^ 
Ql&n-dovQiu’ All that we can infer is that, if this 
Nedumaran is the same as the contemporary of Gnana- 
sambandar, this Alvar may also be assigned to their 
age and likewise his daughter Andal. It seems more 
likely however that the reference is to Sri Mara 
fsrivallabha. But this inference can only be tentative, 
and in any case there is no reason to assign Periyalvar 
to the times of Jatila Parantaka But the references 
in Periyalvar to the Pandyas, and the instances we 
have already noticed of the erection of two temples 
to Visnu in the time of Parantaka Nedunjadayan furnish 
sufficient evidence of the influence of Vaisnavism in 
the Pandya country m this period The epigraphs of 
the age furnish numerous instances of private benefac- 
tions to temples for the burning of lamps, the mainte- 
nance of gardens, etc., and one of these records from 
Tifupputtur (136 of 1908) mentions the gift of ten dzn&ras 
(kffsu) by a Brahmm lady for the burning of a lamp

CHAPTER VIII 


THE CHOLA CONQUEST 

FROM about A.D 925 to the beginning of the thirteenth 
century,* for some three centuries, the Pandyan king- 
dom ceased to exist as an independent state and was 
part of the empire of the Cholas. There are only a few 
records that can be referred with certainty to the Pandya 
rulers of this period and for the rest we have to 
depend on the Chola inscriptions themselves. One thing 
however is clear, namely, that the Pandyas never recon- 
ciled themselves to the rule of the Cholas in their 
country any more than others were willing to bear the 
rule of the Pandyas in the years before The country 
seems to have been in a state of chronic revolt and the 
Chola emperors were fighting repeatedly in the Pandya 
country very much as the Pandya rulers of the first 
empire did in the Travancore and Kongu countries. 
The Chola emperors also found it necessary for a time to 
depute members of the royal family to act as viceroys in 
the Pandya country and the records of some of these 
Chola-Pandya viceroys have come down to us But 
when we piece together all the fragmentary data that 
can be gathered from our sources, we do not get even 
the outline of a continuous account. We get the names 
of only a few of the Pandyan kings of this period There 
is no possibility of tracing the relationship of these 
rulers and* many gaps remain to be filled by future 
discovery and research 

Alter the conquest of Madura by Parantaka I Chola 
and the flight of Rajasimha II about A D 920, the 
Pandya country passed under Chola control and was

subject to Parantaka almost to the end of his reign. This 
is borne out by the inscriptions of Parantaka found m the 
Pandya country, 1 the latest of these being an inscription 
from Sucindram m South Travancore dated in the 
fortieth year of the king corresponding to A.D. 947. In 
the thirty-eighth year of Parantaka, he levied a rather heavy 
impost {dandam) of 3,000 kalanju of gold on the members 
of the assembly of Kumbakonam ( firukkudamukku), 
and they agreed to pay the amount to the Pandippadai- 
yar, by which is perhaps meant the forces that distingui- 
shed themselves in the conquest of the Pandya country. 2 

But towards the close of Parantaka’ s reign, some time 
before A.D. 949, a disaster overtook the newly establish- 
ed Chola power. The Rashtrakuta kmg Krishna III 
invaded the Chola country in great force and Rajaditya, 
the eldst son of Parantaka, lost his life in the battle of 
Takkola. Large portions of the Chola territory were 
occupied by Krishna who advanced as far as Tanjore 
and seems to have reduced the successors of Parantaka 
to an inferior position. 3 We have no stone inscriptions 
in the Pandya country relating to the Chola monarchs 
of this period. 

Dunng this period of trouble in the Chola kingdom, 
the Pandya country seems to have been recovered by a 
member of the ancient royal family. We have a

hands of Vira Pandya has been sometimes identified 
with Parantaka II Sundara Chola 1 This Chola king, 
fought at Chevur a battle which is referred to in the 
larger Leiden grant as follows ‘ At the town named 
Chevur, he, completely filling all the directions by the 
multitude of very sharp arrows sent forth from his own 
beautiful bow, produced manifold rivers of blood*flowing 
from the gieat royal elephants of his foes, cut down with 
his sharp sword ’ 2 It is remarkable that this rather 
forced account of the battle does not claim a victory for 
the Chola king ; this may mean that the Chola king did 
not have the best of the battle in spite of his heroism. 
This inference becomes more certain mthe light of other 
facts. Vira Pandya claims to have taken the head of a 
Chola and his inscriptions mentioning this achievement 
range from his sixth to his nineteenth year ( 1 63 of 1 894 and 
65 of 1896) It is not possible to identify the prince who 
was killed by Vira Pandya , but it cannot be Parantaka 
himself. 3 It seems a legitimate inference to make that 

father’s death is a mistake as it seems to contradict the evidence on the battle 
of Takkdla ( ARE , 1892, p 3 , contra E 1 , vol xv, p 52) , see also Trav 
Arch Senes, vol ill, pp 67 ff The discussion of this subject in ARE, 
1926, part ii, paras 13 ff does not seem to carry it much farther

para 31, part ii, of A R E for 1915 It is rather strange that Mr Sastn 
should think that the larger Leiden grant says that a Vira Pandya was 
defeated by Sundara Chola He also remarks ' The boast of Vira Pandya 
that he also took the head of the Choi? king may be explained by assuming 
that before he was beheaded by Aditya II he would probably have kilk-d 
a Chola 1 See also ARE, 1921, p 109 The number of years (13) covered 
by the records of Vira Pandya ‘ who took the head of the Chola ’ preclude 
the supposition that he killed Sundara Chola and was himself hi 1 led soon 
after by Aditya II c

Pallavarayan and a Cholantakan null (grain-measure) 
Cholantaka was probably a surname assumed by Vira t 
Pandya after his successful fight with the Cholas 1 and 
the reference to the null may imply that the king found 
time to regulate the weights and measures used m the 
land Six inscriptions of this king from the Ramnad 
district refer to a Sundara Pandya Isvaram Udaiyar 
temple in Tirucculi Palli madam, a village in the 
district , it is not possible to say who this Sundara 
Pandya was though it seems certain that he must have 
been closely connected with Vlra Pandya. 

It is not known if Madhurantaka Uttama Chola 
undertook any expedition against Madura as his biruda 
may imply, or as seems more likely, if he only inherited 
his title from his father Gandaraditya who has been 
identified with Maduraikonda Rajakesari of the inscrip- 
tions 2 At any rate, there is no reason to doubt that 
the Chola power was not fully restored in the Pandya 
country by the success of Aditya 1 1 and that later, it 
became more firmly established m the time of the great 
Raja Raja I who came to the Chola throne in A.D 985. 
That Raja Raja took great credit for his conquest of the 
Pandya country is clear from his inscriptions. A record 
of the twenty-ninth year of Raja Raja says, for instance, 

‘ that he deprived the Seliyas (1 e. the Pandyas) of 
(their) splendour at the very moment when (they were) 
resplendent (to such a degree) that (they were) wortay 
to be worshipped everywhere ’ 3 But we know little of 
the details 1 It is in inscriptions of the eighth year

(A.D. 994) of the king’s reign that the usual historical 
introduction, beginning with the words Tuumakalpolay 
which was evidently composed after the conquest of the 
Pandyas, occurs for the first time ’ (Venkayya) and the 
conquest of the south may be taken to have far advanced 
by that time The little that is known of the campaigns 
of this* conquest has been summarised by Venkayya 1 
a§ follows ‘ In his first campaign the king is said to 
have destroyed a fleet in the port of Kandalur, which 
appears to have been situated in the dominions of the 
Chera king The Tiruvalangadu plates which furnish a 
lengthy account of Raja Raja’s campaigns do not men- 
tion this item at all They begin with the war against 
the Pandyas and report that Raja Raja seized the Pandya 
king, Amarabhujanga, and that the Chola general captur- 
ed the port of Vilmam Perhaps, Kandalur or Kandalur 
Salai was near Vilmam It is not unlikely that the 
Chola king fought on more than one occasion against the 
Pandyas The Cheras and the Pandyas appear to have 


1 See S 1 1 , vol n, Intro , pp 2-3 Venkayya also says 'A place named 
Udagai ( 0 -/ 01 ) is mentioned in connection with the conquest of the Pan- 
dyas (p 250, n 3) The Kahngattupparani refers to the "storming of 
Udagai ” in the \ erse which allndes to the reign of Raja Raja. The KulSt- 
tunga-Solan Ula also mentions the burning of Udagai This was probably 
an important stronghold in the Pandya country which the Chola king 
captured ’ But the Kahngattupparani, verse vm 22, clearly implies that 
Udagai was not in the Pandva country but outside the traditional limits of 
tJ*t kingdom , therefore Mr Venkayja’s note to the passage quoted 
aboieis more to thepoin* ‘ The Kilur inscription of Raja Raja’s twenty- 
seienth year (No 236 of 1902) which is partly mutilated, supplies a histori- 
cal introduction of the king m Tamil poetry, different from the usual 
a etc? , and mentions the king’s conquest of Udagai in his campaign 
against Malainadu As already stated the Pandya country must have also 
included Malainadu at the time of Raja Raja’s conquest ’ On KandalSr 
Salai, see Trav Arch Senes, \ ol 11 , pp 2-5 for a more likely interpretation 
Pandit M Raghava Aiyangar is inclined to interpret all references to 
scnjpffa as suppressions of local risings But there are 
difficulties in accepting this view also

been allied together in their war against the Chola king, 
for in the Tanjore inscriptions reference is frequently 
made to the conquest of the Chera king and the Pan- 
dyas in Malainadu, 1 e. the west coast. Kandalur Salai 
which is stated to belong to the Chera king in later 
inscriptions was probably held by the Pandyas when it 
was attacked by Raja Raja.’ Many inscriptions of Raja 
Raja have been found in various places in the Pandya 
country and these range from the ninth to the twentieth 
years of his reign. Other facts also show that the Chola 
suzerainty in the Pandya country was firmly established 
by Raja Raja. Even the name of the Pandya country 
undergoes a change and becomes Raja-raja-Mandalam 
or Raja-raj a- Pandinadu in the Chola records , 1 and we 
come to hear of a sub-division Pandya-kulasam-valanadu 
for the first time in the age of Raja Raja or possibly a 
little earlier 2 Among the queens of Raja Raja is one 
Pancavanmahadevi referred to in inscriptions from the 
tenth year of Raja Raja (No. 254 of 1907) , and in the 
twenty-eighth year of the king a grant is made by one 
of his queens Vemban Imrudaiyar alias Mlnavan Maha- 
deviyar 3 Raja Raja apparently also used the Pandya 
country as a base for a successful raid on Ceylon between 
the seventeenth and twentieth years of his reign 4 A 
Tanjore inscription of the twenty-fourth year of Raja Raja 5 
contains an order dealing with defaulters in land-revenue 
in Pandmadu alias Raja-raja-valanadu, among others'

surely before the twelfth, Rajendra had to undertake 
an expedition against the Madura country m order to 
reassert his authonty which seems to have been chal-' 
lenged in some way or other. The early inscriptions 
of the king dated before his tenth year make no mention 
of any conquest of Maduraimandalam , and we hear of it 
for the first time in a record of his twelfth year from 
Tirumalai. 1 It is possible that this reconquest is refer- 
red to in verses 91-93 of the Sanskrit portion of the 
Tiruvalangadu plates. 2 ‘ The dandanatha of this crest 
jewel of the solar race (1 e. Madhurantaka) , struck the 
Pandya king who had a powerful army. (And) the 
Pandya, leaving his own country from fear of Madhuran- 
taka, sought refuge in the Malaya hill which was the 
residence of (the sage) Agastya (Then) the politic son 
of Raja Raja took possession of the lustrous pure pearls 
which looked like the seeds (out of which grew) the 

Pandja country and it is not likely that these coins were issued in that 
period l have already said that the Madras Museum plates of Parakesari 
Uttamaehola mav be ascribed to Rajendra also (n 1, p 101) And Dr 
Hultzsch remarks 1 The close resemblance of the devices on the coins (re- 
ferred to in this note) to those on the seal of the inscription leaves little 
doubt that both the coins and the inscription have to be attributed to the 
same king Uttamachola ’ ( ARE , 1891, p S) 

1 See is /, vol ix, p 232 Hultzsch’s remark at p 230 is / ix ‘Madura- 
mapdala need not be connected with Madura, the capital of the Pandya 
king, who has been already accounted for, but may be meant for the district 
of the northern Mathura on the Yamuna ’—will be plausible if the identifi- 
cation of SakkarakkSttam rests on a secure basis , but this is very doubtful 
and it is possible to adopt the usual meaning of Maduraimapdalam afl.d 
explain the new conquest as in the text The Pandya king moreover hns 
not been ‘ already accounted for ’ but only ‘ two other trinkets which the 
Pandja king had previously deposited with the king of Ceylon ’ , 

'The Sanskrit part of the plates dates only from the sixteenth year of Rajen 
dra at the earliest (see S 1 1 , vol ill, p 384) and cannot compare in accura 
cj with the Tamil stone inscriptions of Rajendra, hence no violence is done 
to the authority of these verses when the campaign they refer to i^laced

criptions of Jataxarman Sundara Chola-Pandja are found 
all oxer Madura and Tmnevelly and portions of Puduk-

113 and 1 14 of 1905) of the sixteenth year of this prince 
from Mannarkovil near Ambasamudram mention the Chera 
kings Raja Raja and Rajasimha and another record from 
the same place (No. 112 of 1905) dated m the twenty- 
fourth year of Rajendra himself says that Rajasimha 
built m Mannarkovil the Visnu temple called Rajendra* 
cholavinnagar. 1 Besides Jatavarman Sundara Chola- 
Pandja, two other Chola princes are known from Chola 
inscriptions to have been appointed to the viceroyalty of 
the Pamtyan kingdom In the historical introductions 
of Rajendradeva {c. A D. 1052-1064), he is stated to have 
conferred on one of his jounger brothers, the victorious 
Mummadi Solan, the title Chola-Pandyan. 2 Again 
some jears later Virarajendra I conferred on his son 
Gangaikondachola the Pandimandalam and the title 
Chola*Pand>a. 3 It is not possible to identify these 
princes in the Chola- Pandya records very clearly, and 
it is not unlikely there were two or three princes similarly 
deputed to rule the Pandyan kingdom. But this 
system does not seem to have been continued after the 
accession of Kulottunga I about A.D. 1070. 4

after the conquests of Rajendra was no doubt a contribu- 
tory factor. 1 

Almost every one of the kings who reigned between 
Rajendra I Gangaikonda and Rajendra II alias Kulot- 
tunga I — he ought properly to be numbered third among 
Rajendras — claims to have conquered the Pandya 
country and some add also an attack on Udagii in the 
Kerala country to the list of their achievements. §ut 
we are not yet in a position to trace in detail any of these 
expeditions, the circumstances that led to them or their 
results But a record of the twenty-ninth year of 
Rajadhiraja I corresponding to A D 1046 contains the 
names of three Pandya kings who opposed him and 
suffered terribly for doing so. Their fates are recorded 
in an inscription in the following terms 2 ‘ Among the 
three allied kings of the south (i.e Pandyas), Rajadhi- 
raja cut off on a battlefield the beautiful head of 
Manabharanan (which was adorned with) large jewels 
(and) which was inseparable from the golden crown, 


1 Mr Venkayya remarks that though the Pandya country was conquer- 
ed early in Raja Raja I’s reign, Chola Pandya viceroys come in only with 
Rajendra Chola I whose extensive scheme of foreign conquests made them 
necessary and that 1 the name Pandya was perhaps added at the end of the 
Chola prince's namo partly to reconcile the people to their new ruler ’ 
(ARE, 1905, pp 48-9) Mr K V S Aiyar says on the other hand, 1 The 
necessity for their appointment arose from the fact that the Pandyas could 
never be completely subdued They continued in a state of chronic revolt 
against the Chola joke during the whole period of Chola supremq^v in 
South India '(El, vol xi, p 293 ) Our view is that Rajendra made the 
discovery only about the tenth year of his reign that some special steps were 
necessary for keeping a tight hold on the Pandya country , and that the 
Pandyas derived a great part of their strength from thee traditional sway 
thej had secured m the hearts of their people, and the rest from their 
political alliance with Ceylon It is remarkable that all the sternness of the 
Chola emperors was not able to root out the Pandyas , and that fhe latter 
sboula have ultimately got the better of their conquerors, and in the end 
e\en contributed largely to their downfall

it seems never to have completely recovered under Kulot- 
tunga and his successors At any rate, we do not find 
under Kulottunga and his successors the same vigour in 
the administration of the empire that characterized the 
Vijayalaya line, and the Pandya kingdom, now apparent- 
ly freed from the presence of the Chola-Pandya viceroys, 
slowly began to pass more and more under the domina- 
tion of the descendants of its ancient rulers until at last it 
not only secured its own independence but helped a good 
deal to pull down the power of its erstwhile dominant 
foe. But before we take up this part of the story, some- 
thing remains to be said about the administration of the 
Pandya country under the imperial Cholas of the Vijaya- 
laya line. 

There is a general order of Raja Raja I recorded in an 
inscription of the twenty-fourth year of his reign, i.e , 
about A.D. 1009 1 which ‘ deals with defaulters of land 
revenue in villages held by Brahmins, Vaikhanasas 
and Jainas in the Chola, Tondai and Pandya coun- 
tries.’ 2 The default in the payment of revenue seems - 
to have been on the part of a special class of tenants 
who are referred to as ‘ «/r croft e_ant_tu/r/r ’ and who seem 
to have in some manner abused their privileged position , 
the penalty that is laid down by the royal order is 
drastic, but it must be noticed that it applied to other 
territories besides the Pandya country. The king orders 
that all ‘ «/r croft e_ 63 ii _ iu rrir ’ who between the sixteenth

villagers shall arrange to sell the lands among them- 
selves, but the old defaulters shall not be allowed to buy 
up.these lands again. The same rule was to be observed 
in all similar cases of default after the twenty-fourth year 
of the king’s reign The whole record looks like an 
attempt to regulate the administration of charitable 
endowments made on behalf of several religious orders 
and to secure that they did not escape public dues that 
were laid on them by the terms of the original endow- 
ment or the custom of the country. Inscriptions Nos. 
327 and 619 of 1916, which are Chola-Pandya records 
from Tiruvallsvaram and Sermadevi in the Tinnevelly 
district, seem to contain interesting particulars of land 
revenue administration But the text of these records is 
not yet available and this is how the official epigraphist 
summarizes them ‘ This record (No 327) refers to a 
gift of land by him (Sundara Chola-Pandya) after pur- 
chasing it from the sabha of Raja Raja Caturvedi- 
mangalam i.e , Ambasamudram (It should rather be 
Brahmadesam) The income from the land included 
paddy given by the cultivator (vellzn) as owner’s share 
ancTmoney called uruvukdl-nilan-ka.su and kakshi-erudu- 
kasu No 619 of the seventeenth year of the same 
king’s reign refers to similar items of income under the 
heads of alagerudu-katchi-kasu , kcltchi-erudu-kasu and 
Tlrkkcdaniu. The order sanctioning the transfer of the 
land from the Brahmadeya register to the Devadsna 
register in No. 327, was communicated to the viceroy, 
the document being signed by not less than twenty-two

officers of the emperor ’ 1 The collection of the dues 
partly m kind and partly in money and the mention of 
sundry pecuniary levies under different names deserve 
special attention. Further study may lead to a clear 
understanding of the nature of these cesses Another 
Chola- Pandya record which registers a sale of land to the 
Visnu temple Rajendra Chola Vmnagaram at 'Mannar- 
k5vil may also be briefly referred to The sale in this 
case was ordered by the members of the sabha of Raja 
Raja Caturvedimangalam, already referred to , several of 
these members who ordered the sale were learned men 
bearing titles like Bhatta, SdmaytZjin and Kramavit and 
they seem to have been resident m the different suburbs 
{sen) of the village , and some at least among them 
appear to have been immigrants from other parts of the 
Chola empire 2 The sale deed {Sdsa g&Sw) is written by 
the Karanattan {sa-ssir^^irm) of the village and the sale is 
referred to by thejnembers of the assembly in the phrase 
‘ jQBso GpSsoQ&tugi fiQim—t—isi-GQGirGZpQprriB (1. 4). 

One reference to a matha of the sect of Mahavratins 
that occurs in a Vatteluttu inscription from Tiruccuh in 
the Ramnad district is sufficiently important to deserve 
special mention It occurs m a record of the eleventh 
year of Vira Pandya ‘ who took the head of the Chola ’ 
(No. 423 of 1914). This reference is confirmed by

2 Cf El , vol xl, pp 292 ff Mr K V S Aiyar remarks in a note 
at p 292, ‘It is worthy of note that two of the signatures at the end of 
the inscription are m Sanskrit Such admixture of Sanskrit \yords in a 
Tamil record of this period may be accounted for, to a certain extent, by the 
rev ival of learning brought about by the immigration to the southern coun- 
try of a large number of Brahmins from the north as a result of the con _ 
quests of Rajendra Chola I, which extended as far as the Ganges ,c But the 
admixture of Sanskrit in Tamil records is very common even in the age of 
the First Empire as we have seen and even then the immigration of 
Brahmins from the north was not unknown

another record of Vikramakesan, a Kodumbalur chief- 
tain, who claims to have conquered Vira Pandya m 
battle This chieftain was the son of a Chola princess 
and probably took the side of the Cholas against Vira 
Pandya in the wars mentioned at the beginning 
of this chapter 1 Vikramakesan presented a big matha 
(b? ihan : matham) to a certain Mallikarjuna of Madura, 
who was the chief ascetic of the Kalamukha sect, with 
eleven villages for feeding fifty ascetics of the same sect 
(called asita-vaktui), Mallikarjuna belonged to the 
Atreya gotra and was the disciple of two teachers 
Vidyarasi and Taporasi These references reveal the 
presence in the Madura and Ramnad districts and m the 
Pudukkottah state — the Vikramakesan record comes 
from Muvarkoil in that state — of a considerable number 
of the ascetics of the Mahavrata or Kalamukha sect of the 
Saivas Dr Bhandarkar says of this sect ' It will be 
seen how terrible and demoniacal this sect was . . 
Mahavrata means the great vow, and the greatness of 
the vow consists m its extraordinary nature, such as 
eating food placed m a human skull, besmearing the 
body with the ashes of human carcasses and others 
which are attributed to Kalamukhas by Ramanuja’ 2

CHAPTER IX 


THE END OF CHOLA ASCENDANCY CIVIL WAR 
AND RECOVERY 

THE confusion in the Chola empire that led to the 
accession of the Eastern Chalukya Rajendra alias Kulot- 
tunga I to the Chola throne about A D. 1070 apparently 
gave the Pandyas an opportunity to recover some of their 
lost power A Jatavarman Srivallabha seems to have 
reigned in this period with some real power for a period 
of at least twenty-three years (No 555 of 1922). A con- 
siderable number of his records are found in various 
places in the Tinnevelly and Madura districts, in particular 
at Kuruvitturai and 1 irupputtur Most of these contain 
a grandiloquent historical introduction beginning with 
the words Ttrumadandaiyum Jayamadandaiyuni, but this 
introduction tells us nothing about the historical details 
of his reign. There are references to a throne called 
Pandyarayan, to another throne Kalingattaraiyan which 
seems to have got its name from an important officer 
called Kalingarajan and to 'an Alagiya Pandyan hall in 
which these thrones were placed in the palace at Madura, 
to the east of Madakkulam. There is also reference to a 
Pillaiyar Sundara Pandya, probably the son^of the king 
(493 of 1909). We also learn that drammas were among 
coins current in his time Moreover, ‘ references irrihese 
inscriptions to canals, sluices, water-bunds, etc., called after 
Parakrama Pandya and to the gram measure named Vtra 
Pandya, prove that Parakrama Pandya and Vira Pandya

were two predecessors of Jatavarman Srivallabha or his co- 
regents who greatly improved the agricultural condition 
of the Pandya country 11 It is not possible to determine 
precisely the period of his rule although there is some 
reason to think that he, was a contemporary of Kulot- 
tunga I This is an inference that rests at present only 
on the ‘slender basis that a certain Virasekharan altos 
Adalaiyur Nadalvan refers to the fourth year of Jata- 
varman Srivallabha m one inscription and the forty-ninth 
year of Tribhuvanacakravartin Kulottunga Chola-deva 
in anothei (30 and 32 of 1909). 2 It has been suggested 
that Jatavarman Srivallabha must have adopted the sur- 
name Cholantaka ‘ after subduing the Cholas before he 
could secure for himself the independent position which is 
suggested by the eulogistic and poetical historical intro- 
duction with which his records begin ’ 3 But one cannot

2 See ARE , 1909, part 11 , para 23 end The report for 1917 finds con- 
firmation of the age of Srivallabha in 331 of 1916 from TiruvaliSvaram in 
which a certain Umai Ammai of about the end of the tenth century is 
mentioned Again, No 21 of 1927 in the tenth year of this king refers 
to the thirty-first year of Kulottunga Chola who took Kollam It must be 
noted however that the whole question Is far from satisfactorily settled 
There is a strange inconsistency m the positions taken up in the epigrapbical 
reports about this king We learn (1909) that ' he was perhaps the im- 
mediate predecessor of Jatavarman KulaSekhara of the earlier Tiruppuvanam 
grant ’ at the beginning of a paragraph which ends with the statement 
that he was of the age of Kulottunga I and was among the Pandya 
sovereigns overthrown by him Either of these conclusions must be wrong 
asiJtulSttunga I came to the throne about ad 1070 and conquered the 
Pandyas before a d 1085 ( SI /, vol li, No 58) and KulaSekhara of the 
Tiruppuvanam grant came to the throne in a d 1190 (Kielhom E I ,vol vi) 
The report for 1917 leans to KulOttunga’s time but we hear a different 
story in the report for 1923 which again makes him the predecessor of Jaf 
KulaSekbara (para 46, part 1 i) In the reports for 1918 and 1927 his accession 
is piqued in a d 1291 The only fact which seems to help us in deciding 
this is noted in the test , the rest are impressions and may be ignored 
for the present See also K V S Aiyar, Ancient Dekhan, pp 162-3

accept this m the absence of any mention of such an 
achievement m the introduction itself. It is more hkely c 
that the old name of Cholantaka Caturvedimangalam 
for Kuruvitturai or more probably Solavandan, 1 com 
memorated the success of Vira Pandya, the opponent of 
Aditya II. 

Several inscriptions of Kulottunga Chola I hive been 
found m the Pandya country One has been discovered 
at Tinnevelly (145 of 1894) but the regnal year has been 
lost , and another (31 of 1896) at Kottaru , several others 
are found on the site of ancient Korkai (157, 161 and 162-5 
of 1903). An inscription of the fifth year of Kulottunga 2 
seems to record that an unnamed Pandya king was 
decapitated by him. Another record of the fourteenth 
year 3 repeats this fact and records a fresh conquest 
of the Pandya with several details. It says ‘ Having 
resolved in (his) royal mind to conquer also the Pandi- 
mandalam with great fame, (he) despatched his great army. 

• He completely destroyed the forest which the 
five Pancavas had entered as refuge, when they were 
routed, on a battle-field where (he) fought (with them), and 
fled cowering with fear (He) subdued their country, 
drove them into hot jungles (in) hills where woodmen 
roamed about, and planted pillars of victory in every 
region. (He) was pleased to seize the pearl fisheries, the 
Podiyil (mountain) where <the three kinds of Tamil 
(flourished), the (very) centre of the (mountain) fsai^am 
where furious rutting elephants were captured, and Kanni, 
and fixed the boundaries of the southern country ' . . 

(He) was pleased to bestow on the chiefs of his army, who 
were mounted on horses, settlements on every ^road, '

including (that which passed) Kottaru, in order that the 
•enemies might be scattered ’ ‘ The defeat of the “ five 

Pandyas ” and the burning of Kottaru are referred to also 
m an inscription at Chidambaram and the Kahngattup- 
parani ’ — (Hultzsch) 

What does the reference in these records to the 
‘ five Pandyas 1 (u^^svir Pundyan Panca) 

indicate ? Mr L D. Swannkkannu Pillai once thought 
that the simultaneous rule of five Pandyas was a fact 
established by tradition as well as by the statements 
of contemporary historians , 1 and proceeded to arrange 
the Pandya kings of the thirteenth century known 
to epigraphy on this basis. Mr. Robert Sewell sub- 
jected this position to a searching criticism 2 and 
concluded ' that we must hold the evidence to be over- 
whelmingly in favour of a single monarchy, and that the 
theory of a co-regency of five kings may be altogether set 
aside ’ There is no doubt that on this general question 
of the regular and successive rule of five Pandyan kings 
through several generations the position of Mr Sewell is 
the sounder of the two, and that Mr Pillai seems on the 
whole to have had an exaggerated view of the evidence 
on his side, and that he was misled by a system of 
chronology, based exclusively on dubious astronomical 
data contained m the stone inscriptions of the period 
Mr Sewell refers to the records of KulSttunga I and 
says ‘ In two inscriptions of Kulottunga Chola I the 
king is lauded for having, shortly before A D. 1084, com- 
pletely defeated “ the five Pandyas ” But this is poetry.’ 
It is not easy so to brush aside the clear references in 

1 / A , \ol sbi, p 166 , also vol xliv, pp 172-6 It must be noted that 
Mr Swamikkannu Pillai ’s discussion of Pandja dates in his Ephemens ,

the phrases quoted above On the other hand, it is not 
necessar) that each of these 1 five Pandyas must have, 
been an independent ruler in his own right. It may be 
recalled that one of Kulottunga’ s predecessors on the 
Chola throne, Rajadhiraja, had three Pandyas for his 
opponents, Manabharana, Vira Kerala and Sundara, of 
whom onl} the last is referred to in the Chola records in 
terms befitting a reigning king We do not get any 
details about the opponents of KulSttunga It may be 
surmised that Jatavarman Srivallabha was among them, if 
this surmise is correct, there can be little doubt that the 
account of Kulottunga who claims to have driven all the 
five Pandyas to the forest and then to have burnt 
that forest is over-drawn, for the chances are that 
Srivallabha survived his defeat by Kulottunga and 
continued to rule, though perhaps with diminished 
power, and this seems to be admitted somewhat later 
in the same record of Kulottunga where we are told that 
he * fixed the boundaries of the southern country ’. 1 

1 This conclusion seems a natural inference from the two records of 
Adalaijur NSdalvan (30 and 32 of 1909) in which he refers to the fourth 
>tar of Srivallabha and the forty ninth year of Kulottunga We know 
that Srivallabha reigned for at least twenty three years and we may assume 
that for the bulk of it his reign overlapped Kulottunga’s We shall have, 
o'he-vvist to credit Adnlaijur Nadahan with a rather unusual length of 
ac‘i\c life, nineteen plus fortv-nine >ears, as there seems to be little doubt 
tha‘ the forty ninth >ear of Kulottunga was later than the fourth of 
S'ivallabha 

Mr H Krishna Sastn seems to accept the co-regent theory He suggests 
th”t M"iravarman Parlhrama Pandya (of 94, 98 and 131 of 1908), and Tn- 
bhu mac'd rav artin Vd nma Pandja Deva (of 26 of 1909) might have been

that this Andapillai who performed the Atirafra ,' sacrifice

almost similar to that of Jatavarman Srivallabha. The 
astronomical details furnished by this record are said to 
yield the date AD 1169 for the inscription , the date is 
not quite regular but may be accepted m the light of 
other evidence relating to the king This would mean 
that Maravarman Srivallabha came to the throne in 
AD. 1132 and that this record is among the last ones of 
his reign 3 But it is doubtful if Srivallabha ruled as 

'ARE, 1909, part h, para 29 Mr Krishna Sastn says ‘As Jata- 
\ arman KulaSehhara was also occupying the throne at Madura called 
Munai>adaraiyan we may perhaps suppose that Maravarman Srivallabha

F or a similar reason 1 have refrained from accepting the proposal to treat 
Maravarman KulaSekhara of Nos 465 and 466 of 1909 as a contemporary 
or successor of Ja*av arman Srivallabha on the strength of the mention of 
Kalingarayan both as the name of a seat and as an officer (see A R,E ,1910,

be quite correct when he considers that historical introductions are a ‘special 
characteristic feature of the Pandya records prior to the time of Jatavarman „

12 8 the pandyan kingdom 

According to the Mahavam'sa the war was undertaken 
after the sixteenth year of Parakramabahu I, i.e. after 
A D. 1168-9 But the Arpakkam inscription of Rajadhi- 
raja is dated in his fifth year which began in A D. 1167 
and shows that the war must have begun before that date. 
It is not easy to say whether the discrepancy is due to 
an error m the Mahavam'sa chronology or in that 
of the Arpakkam record Attention may be drarwn 
however to the fact that m the Arpakkam record and in 
some others 1 the Cholaking is called Parakesarivarman 
whereas the usual epithet of Rajadhiraja II (act. 
A.D. 1163) is Rajakesarivarman. It must also be noticed 
that if ^rivallabha reigned till A.D. 1169 the war com- 
menced more probably after A.D 1168-9 In any case, 
the error is not much and the exact manner of adjusting 
it will have to be decided after further study 2 

The MaJmvam'sa account opens with the siege of 
Madura, which was in the occupation of Parakrama 
Pandya, by Kulasekhara Kulasekhara was probably 
the son of ^rivallabha and the legitimate claimant 
to the throne We do not know who Parakrama was 
and how he got to be in Madura It will be remember- 
ed, however, that Maravarman Srfvallabha is said to have 
ruled from Tinnevelly and this would mean that Kula- 
sekhara on his accession must have done so too , and in this 
we may have some explanation of the occupation of the 
northern part of the Pandya country by a rival prince

THE END OF CHOLA ASCENDANCY

A tempting suggestion offers itself and may be stated 
here with the reservation that it cannot be taken as 
proved until further evidence confirms it A very 
interesting record (35 of 1913) m the fourth year of a 
Parakrama Pandya incidentally refers to the fourth year 
of Vikrama Chola and to Perumal Kulottungadeva, 
which »must be taken to mean Kulottunga II, the succes- 
sor of Vikrama Chola The object of the inscription is 
to record the renewal of a charter of privileges granted 
to certain Palhs m the Aduturai temple several years 
before, when they rescued some images of the Aduturai 
temple which were being removed to Halebid, apparently 
as a result of a military raid into the Chola country b> the 
Hoysala king Visnuvardhana I who claims to have 
marched right up to Ramesvaram The privileges were 
renewed in the fourth year of Parakrama Pandya, as 
stated above, and if this Parakrama was the same as the 
opponent of Kulasekhara, then it would mean that 
Parakrama had been ruling from Madura for some 
time as a separate ruler independent of Kulasekhara 
when the latter attacked him , or it may be that he 
started as a subordinate ruler at first and that Kula- 
sekhara attacked him when he sought to make himself 
independent 1 

However that might have been, when Kulasekhara at- 
tacked him, Parakrama appealed for aid to Parakrama- 
bajiu of Ceylon, who sent an army under the general 
Lankapura But before the Singhalese forces came to 
the .mainland, Kulasekhara succeeded in capturing 
and putting to death Parakrama with his queen and 
children and in occupying the city of Madura But the 
king of Ceylon wanted his general to proceed against

THE PANDYAN' KINGDOM 

Kulasekhara and, after driving him out, to bestow the 
Pandyan kingdom on one of the surviving children of the 
murdered Pandyan king. And thus began the war which, 
as it is narrated in the Mahavam'sa> was nothing but 
a triumphant progress of victory upon victory against 
Kulasekhara, won at first by Lankapura and later by 
rLankapura and Jagad Vijaya who had joined him with 
reinforcements, until in the end Kulasekhara was expel- 
led from the Pandyan kingdom and Vira Pandya, the son 
of Parakrama Pandya, was crowned at Madura. 1 It 
is not necessary to trace these skirmishes in detail as the 
Mah&vamsa account is not yet corroborated in material 
particulars and as it is not easy now to identify many 
small places whose names have been more or less distor- 
ted m the chronicle It may be noticed, however, that 
Kulasekhara found it possible after successive defeats to 
place fresh armies in the field and it was not till sometime 
after Vira Pandya’s coronation that he turned to the 
Cholas for help against the Singhalese troops The inter- 
vention of the Cholas made no difference to the fortunes 
of Kulasekhara, who sustained still further defeats and 
at last ‘ the Singhalese general was satisfied that he 
had rid the country of the enemy and, before going 
back to Ceylon, made over the kingdom to Vira 
Pandya, and ordered that the KaJmpana coin bearing 
the superscription of king Parakkama, z.e Parakramabahu

should be used throughout tbe country.’ So far the 
Mahavavi'sa 

There need be little doubt that this account is very 
one-sided The Ceylon generals are said to have given 
presents to several chiefs m the Pandya country and 
these ‘ look like bribes offered to win them over from 
their ‘allegiance to Kulasekhara’ Thus the success 
against Kulasekhara was not always won on the field of 
battle And after the Chola intervention, it would seem 
that the Ceylon troops actually lost ground and sus- 
tained defeats and it may be suspected that the 
evacuation of the Pandya country by Lankapura was not 
an entirely voluntary retirement after the successful 
completion of the task laid on him by his master. 

Till recently almost the only epigraphical record 
which gave a hint as to the fortunes of the Ceylon troops 
was the Arpakkam inscription which contains a quaint 
account of a miracle wrought in connection with the war. 
‘ The army of Ceylon having taken possession of the 
Pandya country, drove away king Kulasekhara, who 
was in Madura and then began to fight in battle the 
feudatories of the great king Sri Rajadhirajadeva. The 
danger consequent upon the war spreading to the 
districts of Tondi and Pasi combined with the (easy) 
way in which the army of Ceylon gained victories, struck 
terror into (the hearts pf) people both in the Chola 
country and in other districts ’ At this juncture, a 
certain Edirili Sola Sambuvarayan felt great anxiety for 
his -son, who had gone to fight at the head of the Chola 
forces and approached a holy man Svamideva with the 
request that he should pray for divine intercession 
against the Ceylonese Thereupon, His Holiness was 
pleased to declare ‘ This, the army of Ceylon, which 
consists of very vicious and wicked men, removed the 



132 THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 

sacred door of the temple of the god at the holy Rames- 
varam, obstructed the worship and carried away all the 
treasures of the temple We also learn that they are all 
sinners against Siva We shall make the necessary 
attempts for their flight and disappearance (?) after being 
completely defeated in battle and after being ^chased.’ 
‘ 1 Accordingly, he was pleased to worship (Srta) for 
twenty-eight days continually Subsequently, messen- 
gers arrived from my (Sambuvarayan’s) son Pallavarayar 
bringing a letter (to me) reporting that Jayadratha 
Dandanayaka and Lankapura Dandanayaka and the 
other generals and the troops fled having been defeated.’ 
This is the account that is dated in the fifth year of 
Parakesan Rajadhiraja and that causes some difficulty, 
as we have seen, m the chronology of the war. Another 
record m the eighth year of Rajadhiraja wherein he is 
given his usual title Rajakesan (No 433 of 1924) is more 
historical in that it contains nothing supernatural , it is 
also more direct in its reference to the war ‘ When the 
king of Ceylon {ffipf pens- men) sent his army and generals 
to conquer and annex the Pandya country, the Pandya 
king Kulasekhara fled from his kingdom and sought 
refuge with the Chola and entreated him to recover his 
kingdom for him Thereupon the latter was pleased to 
direct that Kulasekhara be reinstalled on his throne 
after killing the Ceylonese commander and his 
lieutenants who had entered the Pandya country and 
nailing up their heads over the gates of Madura In 
accordance with the direction of the Chpla king, 
Kulasekharadeva, during his stay m the Chola country, 
was entertained with deserving liberality. With enough 
forces, funds and zeal the Pandya country was recon- 
quered by the Cholas, Lankapun Dandanayaka and his 
generals being put to death and their heads nailed on to 



THE END Or CHOLA ASCENDANCY 133 

the gateway of Madura Arrangements were then made 
for the entry of Kulasekharadeva into Madura after taking 
f necessary precautions against the future annexation 
of the Pandya country to Ilam ’ It was the minister 
Pallavarayai who did all this 1 

It will be readily seen that these two inscriptions 
agree with the Mahavam'sa in important particulars 
The name'' of Pandanayaka Lankapun and the Madura 
king K ula^ekhara and the intervention of the Cholas in 
f.nourof Kulasekhara are common to them all But 
both the epigraphs refer to defeats sustained by the 
Ceylon forces about which the Mahavamia is silent, and 
there is a rather grave disagreement in detail between 
the two inscriptions as to the fate of the Ceylon 
generals the Arpakkam record states that they returned 
to Cey Ion after their defeat by Pa 11 a va raj a r, w r hile the 
other inscription says that their heads w-ere nailed to the 
gates of Madura by order of the Chola king And if we 
recall that a still later rccoid of the twelfth year of Raja- 
kesari Raj ad hi raj a (465 of 1905) refers to this same war 
and to the part played in it by a traitor named fari- 
vallabha, it becomes clear that man) gaps still remain to 
be filled in our account of the war 

That this war did not end with the retreat of 
Lankapura and the restoration of Kulasekhara by the 
Cholas becomes clear from the Chola records of the suc- 
ceeding years, 2 specially those of Kulottunga III, the

successor of Rajadhiraja II. We do not know how long 
Kulasekhara lived after the restoration , it may have ^ 
been at most for about a decade from the eighth year of ij 
Rajadhiraja to the second 01 third of Kulottunga III— ' 
AD 1170-80 roughly Thereupon he seems to have 
been succeeded by a Vikrama Pandya 1 and on the 
accession of Vikrama Pandya, Vira Pandya ‘appears to 
have made another attempt, again with Ceylonese help, 
to dislodge the Kulasekhara line , once more the Cholas 
came to the aid of the latter and the war was renewed 
An undated inscription, latek than the fourth year of 
Kulottunga (1 of 1899), 1 e., A.Dx. 1182, records that ‘ the 
son or sons of Vira Pandya were ^defeated by the Chola 
army The Singhalese soldieis ha^d their noses cut off 
•and rushed into the sea to escape from! the Chola troops. 
Vira Pandya himself was attacked b)Kthe Cholas and 
compelled to retreat. The town of Madura\was captured 
'and the Chola army took possession of tfire-Pandva 
throne and planted a pillar of victory (at Madura) The*

KulSttunga III distinguished himself, and in consequence, assumed a 
surname similar to that of Riijadhirajadeva’ (see S 1 1 , \ol ill, part i, No 
36) But may it not be that RSjadhiraja assumed the surname merely 
as a result of Pallavarayar’s campaigns against Lanhapun ? Mr Venknyyn 
himself noticed in the same place No 1 of 1899 and found subsequent!} 
other records of Kulottunga HI which give reasons for Kulottuiyra’s sur- 
name {ARE, 1907, p 62, para 40 and 1908, p 67 para 64) Moreover, 
further research has shown that Kulottunga III could not have been more 
than twelve or thirteen years of age in the eleventh year of Rajadhiraja’s 
reign {ARE, 1924, part ii, paxa 20) * 

It may also be noticed that No 1 of 1899 is not dated in the fourth year of 
'Kulottunga III, but appears to be of some date later than his fourth \ eaR.

know how he was related to KulaSehhara or what happened to him.

were then made over to Vikrama Pandya, who was an 
ally of the Cholas,' The same incidents are recorded 
^in later inscriptions of Kulottunga III with small varia- 
tions 1 The title ' capturer of the Pandya country 1 
assumed b) Ammaiyappan Rajaraja Sambuvaraya, as 
early as the fourth >ear of the king (A.D 1182 ) shows 
that lie rendered valuable help to his Chola overlord, by 
whoip he must have been so honoured. 2 Ivulottunga 
himself assumed the title Pand)ari and performed the

apparenll) after a second rebellion b) Vlra Pandya and 
a battle at Nettur in which he was beaten and captured

records of the sixteenth year (42 and 43 of 1906 ) mention

to Travancore as recorded m the sixteenth year We do 
not know anything as to what happened to him afterwards. 
Whatever happened to Vira Pandya and his relatives, 
it seems clear that Kulottunga succeeded in establishing 
Vikrama Pandya on the Pandya throne and thus putting 
an end to all disputes about the succession m which the 
Cholas and the Ceylon kings had taken sides for over a 
decade But it is not yet possible to ascribe any inscrip- 
tions with confidence to this Vikrama Pandya and we 
cannot say if he was the immediate predecessor or not of 
Jatavarman Kulasekhara who came to the throne of the 
PandyasinA D. 1190, the allusion to the time of Penyana- 
yanar ^rivallabha m a record of Kulasekhara (No no 
of 1907) must however be borne in mind in coming to 
a conclusion on this question 1 

The intervention of Kulottunga III in favour of 
Vikrama was apparently the last occasion on which the 
Cholas were able to interfere effectively in the affairs 
of the southern kingdom ‘ Either during the lattei 
portion of his reign or on his death, the power of the. 
Cholas seems to have declined, though the causes cannot 
now be easily ascertained He was succeeded about the 
year A.D. 1216 by his son Tnbhuvanacakravartin Raja- 
rajadeva III whose capacity for military organization does 
not appear to have been very high. He has no exploits 
to boast of. It was? evidently the weakness of the 

Cholas that led to the occupation of the Chola ceuntry 
by the Hoysalas under Vira Somesvara and to the con- 
quest of Kanchl by the Kakatlya king Ganapati. ,,? After

the close of the civil dissensions in the Pand)a country 
brought about by Kulottunga’s intervention, the Pandya 
kings appear to have recovered remarkably and it turned 
out that Kuiottunga had thus only increased the difficul- 
ties of his successor and forced him to seek the help 
of the Ho) sains — a step which only added still further 
to his ‘troubles and those of the Chola empire. But 
we are touching on the political conditions out of 
which was to grow- the Second Empire of the Pandyas 
which lasted in great power throughout the thirteenth 
centurj \ D 



CHAPTER X 


THE PANDYAS OF THE SECOND EMPIRE 
(1190-1238) 

AFTER the close of the civil wars and the secure res- 
toration by Kulottunga III of Vikrama Pandya to the 
throne of Madura, the Pandya kingdom recovered 
rapidly much of the power and glory that characterized 
it in the days before the sack of Madura by Parantaka I 
We have at present no means of judging how far 
Vikrama Pandya himself profited by his opportunity. 
He seems to have had on the whole a troubled time, and 
he was apparently a weak ruler who depended more on 
Kulottunga’s support than on his own strength for defend- 
ing himself against the attacks of his enemies Even 
when he had occupied the throne for seven or eight years, 
it needed Kulottunga’s intercession to maintain his 
power, when Vlra Pandya attacked him in some foice 
about A D 1187 After the campaign which ended in the 
defeat of Vira Pandya at Nettur, KulSttunga held a 
great durbar m the Pandya capital at which Vira 
Pandya and his Chera contemporary did him obeisance 
and Kulbttunga placed his foot on the head of * the 
former 1 Thus, almost throughout his reign — Vikrama 
does not seem to have long survived the events just 

1 The facts are narrated in two records of Kulottunga dated in his eleventh 
and nineteenth years (Nos 87 and 88 in SII, vol ni, part 11 ) The 
later record gives more details than the earlier, but the reference is evi- 
dently to the same transactions See also the notes at the end of the last

different results in the'hands of different scholar's, and 
often in the hands of the same scholar at different, 
times. New kings have been postulated and given up 
in a manner that has tended to make the chronology of 
the age a game of ninepins. As one wades through the 
results of Kielhorn, Jacobi, Swamikkannu Pillai and 
Sewell, one almost gets the feeling that ignorance, at 
least of astronomy, is bliss and the general rule followed 
in our narrative is not to accept any conclusion that is 
not endorsed by more than one of these four earnest 
savants whose patient labours, especially those of Kiel- 
horn, have alone rendered possible even such a pro- 
visional narrative as is given here It must be noted 
also that paleography fails to furnish any material 
assistance in confirming or correcting the results of 
astronomy Mr. Sewell remarks 1 ‘ Unless the num- 
ber of the solar day of the month is stated, and it is 
not as a rule stated, all the ordinary details of a Chola or 
Pandya date will be found often to correspond with 
about three different days in a century ’ , and palaeo- 
graphy cannot possibly decide among them 2 And 
even the texts of most of these records are yet 
unpublished It is obvious that in the present state of 
our knowledge we shall have to leave on one side all the 
records which cannot with confidence be assigned to

* Mr L D Swamikkannu Pillai, for instance, after wavering between two 
dates for a Maravarman Vikrama Pandya’s accession 1269-70 and a d 1283 
and between two rulers of the same name, finally gave up the a d 1283 date 
altogether r epigraphy furnishes no aid here (See A R E , 1922, part u,

to the strange manner in which the official epigraphist discusses Nq,393 of 
1917 at para 49 of part u of the report for 1918 It should be noticed m parti- 
cular that even when it is a question of dates centuries apart (in this case 
eleventh and thirteenth centuries) palaeography is inconclusive Sewell, at

which is a vague hint that the Pandya kingdom is begin- 
ning to hold its own against its Chola and Chera neigh- 
bours. A lather early inscription of the reign (No. 665 
of 1916) from Sermadevi ie£ers to a gift by the king to a 
temple in the name of his brother-in-law (lo^a-resT^ir) 
Kodai Ravivarman, undoubtedly a Chera prince. Another 
record of some years later (No 370 of 1916) seems to 
imply that the contemporary Tiruvadi king of Jetunga- 
nadu was a subordinate of Kulasekhara , but we have as 
yet no means of explaining the dynastic connection 
mentioned in the earlier record. 2 In the numerous inscrip- 
tions of Kulasekhara from the Ramnad district, is found 
the name of one of the important local officials of the king, 
who seems to have played a considerable part for over 
a decade in the administration of the division known as 
Kalavalinadu and was thence known as Kalavali-Nadalvan, 
his proper name being mentioned as J ayangondasblan 
fsivalluvan (No. 313 of 1923) 3 Several other in- 
stances can be cited from, the other records of this and 
other kings From the provenance of Kulasekhara’ s 
inscriptions we may conclude that his rule extended over 
the bulk of the modern districts of Madura, Ramnad and

baram. Apparently, dunng his sojourn in Chidambaram, 
he sent for his defeated enemy saying that he would 
restore to him the country and ciown that he had recently 
lost , and the Chola king returned and together with 
his son prostrated before the loyal seat of the victori- 
ous Pandya , the victor, true to his word, restored the 
crown ahd country of the Chola in the form of a religious 
gift, which was confirmed by the issue of a royal rescript 
with the Pandyan seal on it and the title of Cholapati to 
the vanquished ruler So much we learn fiom the record 
of the seventh year It may also be noted that in the 
records of the seventh and subsequent years Sundara 
Pandya gets one or another of the titles ©ar/rcnr-

Now, there is little reason to doubt that the facts so 
recorded in Sundara’s inscriptions are substantially true , 
and the language of every inscription makes it a paean of 
triumph For the first time after several centuries of 
subjection to Chola rule, followed by a period of civil 
war and abject dependence on Chola support, Sundara 
Pandya apparently in the prime of life had success- 
fully carried fire and sword into the heart of the Chola 
country an G what was more^ had, by an act of political 
good^eense in restoring the Chola country to its vanquish- 
ed ruler, raised himself and his country in the estimation 
of his Contemporaries. The ground had been prepared m 
the days of Kulasekhara, but so long as Kulottunga III 
lived* the memory of the support Vikrama Pandya had had 
at his hands against Vira survived, and Kulottunga him- 
self was a more capable ruler than his ill starred succes-

were called to power about the same time , and they had 
no old memories, either of them, that need have; 
hampered their ambitions. And it was the law of life 
in those days among Indian kings that he who could 
not be hammer had to be anvil 1 It would seem that 
Sundara Pandya invaded the Chola country very early 
m his reign, though the restoration of the countfy is not 
mentioned till the seventh year 2 

The inscriptions of the twentieth year repeat these 
facts in identical language and add some further parti- 
culars. The king of North Kongu came and complained 
to Sundara Pandya of the wrongs done to him by his rela- 
tives, then, after some time, came also the king of South 
Kongu, accompanied by an army and prostrated him- 
self before the Pandya , Sundara kept both the chiefs as 
his guests for some time and then dismissed them after 
imposing his own terms on them and demanding portions 
of their territory to be ceded to him on pain of death.

submission and gratitude^*,— owed to Sundara. J&.vdya,

there followed another expedition into the Chola coun- 
try, leading to a battle which is described in considerable 
detail, but after a conventional manner. After the fight 
the Chola Icing was absolutely defenceless The women 
of the Chola king including his chief queen fell into the 
hands of the enemy who earned them in captivity to 
Mudikondasolapuram, where, apparently, there was 
another Vlrabhtseka celebrated by the victorious 
Pandya 

It is not easy to interpret these new particulars and 
relate them to the facts recorded in the earlier inscrip- 
tion so as to make a connected story Apparently, 
between the seventh year of Sundara and the twentieth, 

1 e , between, say, A.D 1222-3 and A D 1235-6, he found 
occasion to interfere in the affairs of the Kongu country 
and lead a second expedition against the Chola king 
There seems to be no means of verifying or controlling 
the vague references to the rulers of North and South 
Kongu and their relations to Sundara Pandya It is more 
important to clear up, as far as possible, the relations 
between Sundara Pandya and his Chola contemporary 
Rajaraja III , and in doing so, account must be taken of 
indications gi\en oy contemporary records other than 
those 01 Sundara Pandya himself.

THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 


well-known Tiruvendipuram inscription in the sixteenth 
year of Raja Raja (A.D. 1231-32), from which we learn that 
,the Chola emperor, who had been imprisoned by his 
' rebellious feudatory Kopperunjinga, was released and 
1 restored to power, by the intervention of two generals of 
[ Vira Narasimha, in order to maintain his reputation of 
being the estabhsher of the Chola country. Lastly, we 
have the record of Sundara Pandya in his twentieth year 
(A.D. 1235-6) which gives the story of another defeat and 
dethronement of Raja Raja These are the facts relevant 
to an understanding of the history of the period, and the 
chronology indicated above seems to be rathei well 
established. 

There is reason also to think that at this time the 
Pandya, Chola and Hoysala families were connected by 
marriage alliances. A Chola princess is known to have 
been among the queens of Narasimha’s father Ballala 
II 1 Rajendra III, the successor of Raja Raja, calls 
Somesvara, the son of Narasimha, uncle (Mama) 1 2 
Again, Maravarman Sundara Pandya II (acc. 1238) 
refers also to Somesvara as Mamadi , uncle or father-in- 
' law, and it has been suggested that this relationship may 
be explained by supposing that Maravarman Sundara 
Pandya I (acc. 1216) married a sister of Somesvara , 3

3 A R E„ 1907, part ii, para 26 and 1912, part ii, para 34 It may be noted 

that Mr Krishna Sastn’s assumption that Tnbhuvanacakravartdn 
Konerinmaikondan of Nos 526 and 527 of 1911 was Majavarman Sundara 
Pandya II does dot appear essential to his argument, as it \Qould be if these 
records began in the absence of information on this point, 

and in view of the records being signed by officers of Maravarman Sundara 
Pandya I, ope is tempted to assign these records to this ruler rather than to 
his successor If this is correct, and if Mr Krishna Sastri’s conjecture about 
Pammiyakkan can be upheld by further evidence, then these records will 
become very important in settling the main lines of the tangled diplomacy 



THE PANDYAS OF THE SECOND EMPIRE 1 49 

probably the one mentioned in some Pandya records of the 
age as Pammiyakkan And, as we shall see, under 
Maravarman Sundara Pandya II, the Pandya and the 
Hoysala rulers were on very friendly terms These 
facts go to show that by virtue of their power and 
their dynastic connections, the Hoysalas of this period 
were able and perhaps anxious in their own interest to 
regulate the affairs of the southern kingdoms, in 
particular the relations between the Pandyas and the 
Cholas It appears likely, therefore, that the restitu- 
tion of the Chola country (c AD 1222) to its ruler 
by Maravarman Sundara Pandya I after the first 
conquest was not altogether unconnected with Nara- 
simha’s march against Srirangam about the same time. 

Now what was the nature of Naiasimha’s interven- 
tion ? In effect, it seems to have ended in the re-esta- 
blishment of the Chola on the throne and the consequent 
assumption of the title Cholarajya {niandala) pratistha- 
carya by Narasimha It is not however so easy 
to judge what the effect of the intervention was on the 
Pandya king and his kingdom The Pandya conquest 
of the Chola country is referred to as early as the third 
year of Sundara Pandya, while the restoration of the 
kingdom is not mentioned m any inscription earlier than 
the seventh year The interval, A D. 1219-23, covers, 
m Hoysal» history, the deatji of Ballala II and the early 
year,§ of Narasimha II An inscription of Narasimha in 
A.D 1223 (Cn. 197 ) 1 gives him the titles ‘ displacer of 


of the age on the lines indicated in the text in a very tentative manner. See

‘ Indra to the mountain, the pnde of the Pandya cham-

in a record of A.D 1237 (Ak. 123) 1 to a victorious 
expedition (digvijayct) against the Pandya and to ‘ the sea 
roanng out with the sounds of great fish, sharks

advising the Pandyas to surrender (Ak 123) ma> be 
dismissed as poetic and also the reference to Narasimha’s 
fame as ‘destroyer of the Pandya’ may be discounted 
as a late account not entitled to the same weight as 
the strictly contemporary references in the earlier re-

taken to furnish the clue to a correct estimate of the 
nature of Narasimha’s intervention on bebalf of the 


1 Rice remarks in his summary of this inscription that it ' describes the 
king as encamped in a D 1234 at Ravitadana-kuppa while on a victorious 
expedition over the Pandya and this has led Mr Krishna Saitn to postulate 
a Hoysala invasion of the Pandja country in continuation ot the Senda- 
mangalam expedition (1232-3) of the Hoysala generals recorded aj Tim- 
vgndipuram ARE, 1911, part li, para 47 and QJ MS , vol li. p 122 
But a reference to the text and translation of AK 123 shows that the date, 
Saka 1156, refers to the setting up of the God Laksmi Narasimha in 
Somanathpur and not to the encampment 



THE PANDYAS OF THE SECOND EMPIRE 151 

Chola ruler He did not want the Chola power to 
disappear altogether to the great aggrandizement of the 
Pandya , he therefore made up his mind to help the 
Chola to regain his kingdom , this meant that the Pandya 
ruler had to agree to restore the Chola country in the 
manner described already, and to that extent it was a 
setback* to the Pandya power It is however quite pos- 
sible that m the final settlement, the Pandya and the 
Hoysala monarchs took each something for himself from 
the Chola empire. Such an end to this intervention 
may explain the conquests of Narasimha near fsiirangam 
at this time, and the claim of tribute which Sundara 
Pandya seems to have enforced successfully against the 
Chola for some years. In other words, Narasimha’s 
intervention was as much diplomatic as it was military, 
as much in his own as it was in the Chola interest We 
have no means of deciding whether the dynastic connec- 
tion between the Hoysalas and the Pandyas is to be 
dated before or after the events or was part of the 
settlement on this occasion 1 

There is very little evidence to show that, as has 
sometimes been held , 2 the Pandya ruler had the co- 
operation of Kopperunjinga in his war against the Chola 
king. The very full records of the Pandya ruler make 
no reference to this , nor does the Tiruvendipuram 

1 If $jiis reconstruction of the relations is correct, we must assume that 
the Hoysala records exaggerate the achievements o F Narasimha in a military' 
sense as against the Pandya king , a feature which seems quite natural if we 
compare'it to the silence of the Pandya inscriptions as to the actual causes 
of the restoration of the Chola country 

9 E g by Dr S K Aiy'angar, South India and Her Muhammadan Invaders, 
r pp 33-^5 It must be observed that the mention of Kaqlava or Kadavas in 
the Hoysala records (e g Cn 203) is not conclusive proof of such an 
alliance as many chieftains seem to have had this title at the time See, 
however, Mr Shama Sastry on the Gadyakaniamrta m the Mys Arch 
Report, 1924, p 12 


15 2 THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 

inscription, which gives the account of KSppeiunj inga’s 
rebellion against Raja Raja, give any hint of the Pandya 
ruler being involved in it The Hoysalas had an import- 
ant interest in the Chola ruler and his country, apparently 
all through Raja Raja’s reign, and they were ever 
ready to rescue him from the numerous misfortunes to 
which he was subject. But on the occasion of the second 
conquest of the Chola country by Sundara Pandya 
(c A D 1234-5) the Hoysalas seem to have left Raja Raja 
to shift for himself , at any rate we do not know that they 
actively interfered, although Raja Raja even after his 
apparently crushing defeat, seems still to have continued 
m some power up to A D 1243 

Thus the two expeditions of Sundara Pandya against 
the Chola country do not appear to have resulted m any 
permanent occupation or conquest of the Chola country, 
though there are some records of this king outside the 
Pandya country which confirm the historicity of the events 
recorded in the inscriptions cited above. 1 The direct 


1 Some of these records may be noted here one record from 
tarirangam in the ninth year (No 53 of 1892-S// Texts, vol i\ , No 500) 
which refers to a reform in the temple affairs , No 52 of 1897 in the 
seventh year from Tirukkattupnlli recording the building of a sbnne to the 
Goddess {E I , vol vi, p 304) and No 270 of 1901 from Kdviladi 
(Tan] ore Taluq) may, among others, be surely ascribed to our king 
as they all refer to his conquest or restoration of the Cljpla country I 
doubt if records like 41 and 561 of 1921 from Big Kanchipuram and 
fsulamangalam (respectively) which do not contain any specific reference 
to the conquest of the Chola among the titles of the king may, on grounds 
of astronomy alone, be ascribed to this king as has been done 

ARE , 1926 contains a discussion of this king’s reign which 
may be briefly noticed here The epigraphist is surely wrong in 
saying that the anomtment at MudikondaSSlapuram is mentioned only 
in the records of the fourteenth year and afterwards (see inscription 
of the seventh year summarized earlier m this chapter) He says 
that some historical introductions of this king refer to conquests 
of the two Kongus, Ilam and Karuvur The only instances seem 
to be No. 9 of 1926 and No 72 of 1924 which cause a difficulty by 



THE PANDYAS OF THE SECOND EMPIRE 153 

and effective sway of Maravarman Sundara Pandya I must 
be taken to have been more or less confined to the Pandya 
country, including in it portions of modern Puduk- 
kottah and Tnchinopoly, this at any rate is the con- 
clusion that arises from the provenance of the many 
inscriptions that can be assigned to him without any 
possibility of doubt There are references in the records 
(54.6 of 1922, 148 of 1908, etc) to a throne Malavarayan 
at Madura , one recoid (No. 77 of 1916) refers to a throne 
of the same name m a palace at Pon Amaravati in 
Puramalainadu , it also refers to a Mudivalangum- 
perumalsandi evidently instituted in commemoration of 
the restitution of the Chola crown and the date of the 
record is 528 days after the fifth year, i.e., the seventh 
year of the king The coins 1 with the legend Soiiadu- 
kondan must also be ascribed to this king. A record 
from Melkadayam (No. 524 of 1916) m the eighteenth 
year of the king refers to a shrine called Kaliyuga- 
ramesvara, which indicates that the title Kaliyugarama , 
found also in some coin legends, may belong to our 
king or some predecessor of his. A hsayapandyadeva 

seems to have also been another title of this king. 2 


being mixed up with the name of Kulottunga III and his achieve- 
ments The epigraphist says that No 9 of 1926 records that the Chola 
kingdom wasjestored to Kulottunga III, and after a careful consideration 
of the points made in his discussion, »I cannot help thinking that there is 
some jjistake here either in the inscription or in its rendering These two 
records are of the fifteenth and sixteenth years, and both come fiom the 
Ramnad district May it be that there was something in this part of 
SundarS’s reign that led him to look upon himself as the successor of 
Kulottunga III or to ignore his successor Raja Raja by adopting the device 
of a double historical introduction ? 

1 See Sir T Desikachari’s papers on Pandyan Coins in the Tamilian 
Antiquary It has been supposed that coins with the legend, Kacct- 
valangum perwn&l may also belong to this king , but one wishes there 
was more evidence in favour of the supposition than is available at present

MARAVARMAN SUNDARA (urn. A.l> K»38) 
JATAVARMAN SUNDARA (u<, A.u 1L'5U 

MARAVARMAN SUNDARA PANDY \ II succeeded to the 
throne *m A.D. 1238. His inscriptions begin with the 
characteristic formula P 71 malm Tiutvum Pont Java Mm 
dandaiyum and as there seems to be as yet none o{ these 
that gives a regnal year higher than 15 (No 1 32 of 180.1), 
his reign must be taken to have continued up to about 
A.D. 1253. 1 historical introduction of this lulei 

furnishes no information of any value and most of his 
records make large grants for various religious purposes 
such as the study and lecitation of religious hymns in 
temples. There is no reason to believe that the extent 
of the kingdom suffered any diminution under this ruler 
and the political relations among the Pandyas, Cholas and 
Hoysalas seem not to have altered much since the time 
of Maravarman Sundara Pandya I The frequent 


1 For the date of accession, see Kiel horn E / , vol vm Also Swmuih- 
kannuin//4 , vol xln and Sewell in 1 A , vol \liv No 141 of 1902 from 
Tiruvendipuram gives the sixteenth year, but ns the text is not mailable, it 
is not possible to say if it belongs to this king A more serious difliculty is 
presented by No 616 of 1902 from the Tanjore district which refers to the 
seventeenth year and has been referred to a d 1255, (i e , to our king) by 
Messrs Sew^l and Swamlkkannu Pillai But this record like some others 
gives the title * who conquered every country ’ (e g 402 of 1905, 358 
of 1918, 446 of 1909, 582 of 1915) I am unable to accept this as belonging 
to Maravarman Sundara II acc 1238, because (a) No 4G2 of 1916 of the > ear 
12 of Maravarman Sundara Pandya * who was pleased to take all countries ’ 
contains astronomical details which, according to Mr Swamlkkannu Pillai, 
do not suit any date between a d 1216 and 1315 and (6) Sewell has found 
the astronomical details in 616 of 19 j 2 not quite regular (/ A , vol. \liv,

whole of Southern India up to Nellore and Cuddapah 
was brought foi a time under Pandya supremacy 
, and all the rival dynasties, old and new, were beaten 
in the field or laid under tribute The Cholas were 
reduced to a veiy obscure state and the Hoysalas 
were punished for their past aggressiveness , the Kongu 
country ’passed under the Pandyas, and the Hoys ala 
po\yer was confined to its original home in Mysore. 
Ivanchipura became a secondary capital of the Pandya 
empire and m the south the island of Ceylon was 
firmly held by the Pandyan lulers of this period, while 
the Kerala rulers were made tributaries of the empire. It 
would seem that m all these achievements Sundara 
Pandya was ably assisted by princes who were more 
or less closely related to him and held subordinate 
positions in various parts of the empire At least one of 
these is well-known from his records, a Jatavarman Vira 
Pandya of whom something will be said at the beginning 
of the next chapter 1 

1 Reason has been shown before for not accepting the theory of five rulers 
reigning contemporaneously from generation to generation Mr L D 
Sw-imikknnnu Plllai himself seems to ha\e abandoned the theory on further 
consideration, as his discussion of Pandya chronology' (medireval) in part u 
of \ol i of his Indian Ephcmcns proceeds on other lines The new 
arrangement he adopts is to bring together all the Jatavarmans and make 
them constitute one line of rulers and likewise make another, a second line, 
out of all the M^ravarmnns— a course which is notsupported by any reasons 
stated And even so, otcrlapping \if reigns has not been avoided 
Of this-\ery important and \esed question, I am, after a close study of 
the numerous records, unable to see any solution other than the one follow- 
ed in the test, that is, generally to follow Kielhorn’s lead and select the more 
important* and better represented kings for being treated asm the mam line 
of succession and to make the less known rulers subordinate in position 
This is the best that can be done till some discovery enables us to settle the 
f": genealogy of the rulers of this period The absence of published tests of 
most of the records relating to this period Imposes a serious handicap on any 
one who attempts its study 

One general remark may be made The presence of several contemporary 
rulers may be a sign of strength In the empire as in the case of the Chola 



160 THE TANDYAN KINGDOM 

It has been possible to calculate within remarkably 
narrow limits the date of the accession to the throne of

April 20 and 28, AD. 1251 1 His records can 
be distinguished easily by the attribute ‘ Emmand- 
cilamum-koiidaruliyci ’ which belongs only to him among 
the Jatavarman Sundara Pandyas. Several 0 of his 
records also start with the characteristic stringy of 
surnames in Sanskrit commencing with Samasta-'jagaia 
dhEra More rarely there is a long historical introduction 
in Tamil beginning Pumalar Valar Ttka[ Besides a 
long Sanskrit stone inscription in the Srlrangam temple, 
there are several stanzas in Sanskrit celebrating the 
king’s martial prowess and political power and recording 
his splendid gifts to various temples in Tinnevelly, 
Chidambaram, Tirupputkuli, Kanchipuram and other 
places But all the same, it is not possible to give a 
connected chronological narrative of the transactions of 
the emperor’s Oeign from the numerous records of his 
time as so few of them are dated The Sanskrit inscrip- 
tions are all of them m verse and yield no dates whatever 
Of the Tamil records, several contain astronomical parti- 
culars and generally bear regnal years, but most of these 
relate to private transactions 01 record religious gifts 
without containing any references to the political occur- 
rences of the reign. Almost the only exception among 


empire of the tenth and eleventh centuries and the Pandya empire of the 
thirteenth, especially after the accession of Jatavarman Sundarr Pandya 
(1251) , or it may be a sign of weakness as in the case of thd Pandyas of the 
period of decline in the Tinnevelly district There will of course be a 
difference In the one case the presence of a strong central rule unifies the 
administration of the kingdom , m the other, each ruler goes his own way, 
and jealousy and weakness are the result

the published records of the reign is an inscription in 
the seventh year of the king from Tiruppundurutti in the 
Tanjore district (No i66of 1894) with the long histori- 
cal introduction 1 Pumalai , etc , and this gives us an idea 
of the king’s prodigious activity in the early years of his 
rule 

Sundara Pandya proceeded against the Chera king 
with a very small force and destroyed him and his forces 
in a battle and ravaged the Malainadu , 2 he then compel- 
led the warlike Chola of ancient lineage to pay him 
tribute , afterwards he attacked the Hoysalas in the 
region of the Kaven and besieged them m a fortress ; 3 
after inflicting great losses on the Hoysala forces and 
killing many commanders like the brave fbingana, 
Sundara Pandya captured the elephants and horses of 
the enemy together with a large amount of treasure and 
a number of women, but refrained from fighting further 
when he began to letreat from the field 4 Sundara 
then did away with the traitorous 'Serna (Q&mesr) 5 ,

A.d 1258. Though 'the Hoysalas were compelled to 
retreat and to accept defeat for a time, they evidently 
refused to give up their possessions in the Tamil country 
without a struggle, and there was perhaps much fighting 
of which we have no direct evidence now The long 
Sanskrit inscription of Sundara Pandyafrom £rirangam 
opens with the statement that Sundara Pandya'had just 
sent to the other world the Moon of the Karnata Country 
(Sdmesvara) who had caused much trouble to Sriran- 
gam 1 And another inscription of the fourteenth year 
(AD. 1264-5) from Pirupparkkadal, North Arcot 
(No 702 of 1904) registers an order issued by Sundara 
Pandya from Kannanur The death of Somesvara is 
generally placed about A.D 1262 and Sundara Pand)a 
seems therefore to have held Kannanur continuously 
from the time he occupied it some time before his seventh 
year And even after the death of Vlra Somesvara, his 
successor Kamanatha appears to have been mostly kept 
out of Kannanur during Sundara Pandya’s time. 2 

The relations with Ceylon may be reserved for con- 
sideration later The conquest of Sendamangalam and 
the subjugation of its Pal lava or Kadava chieftain is the 
last military success recorded in this epigraph Thib 
chieftain was Kopperunjinga whose records aie found as

some basis ior the boasttui title assumed in the Uraksa- 
rama inscription 1 

As a matter of fact, it is not easy to determine exactly 
the relations between Sundara Pandya and Kopperun- 
jinga If they were so friendly about A.D. 1253, it is 
difficult to see why Sundara Pandya refused the tribute 
sent to him by the Kadava chieftain and attacked his 
capital with such fury and took possession of his kingdom 
and his arm) before finally restoring him to rule over 
his country There is no doubt, however, that at this 
time Kopperunjinga sustained a loss of status and 
became a subordinate tributary of the Pandya emperor. 
Nearl) fourteen years later the Kadava king is found 
remitting his tribute to the Pandya king when he is 
camping in Ctudambaram 2

\n alternative reconstruction of the relations between Sundara Pandya 
and Kopperunjinga may be suggested Ihe enmpuign referred to m 
No 73 of lblh (Vriddhlc ilam) may be treated as an incident in the 
generally hostile relations between the Hoysalas and the rather ubiquitous 
Kopperunjinga with which Sund ira Pandya had nothing to do Then 
Sunda-a's attack on iSendamangal.un will not need any special explanation 
(that is not forthcoming) as it will be part of Ills policy of impen|tl expan- 
sion (digcijaya) And the claim in the Drakgarama record may be 
based on Kopperu-jinga’s subordinate co-operation with Sundara Pandya

TVTAVARV4N SUNDARA PANDYA 167 

Thus, before the seventh year of his reign, Sundara 
Pandja extended his sway over Travancore, and the 
modern districts of Trichmopoly (including Puduk- 
kottah), Taniore and South Arcot There were other 
successes achieved about the same time or soon after 
that are mentioned in the Sanskrit introduction begin- 
ning Safiiai.iajacrada'lhaia which appears as early as the 
seventh lear of the reign (No 260 of 1906) and in other 
records There is no possibility at present of deter- 
mining the order in which these expeditions were 
undertaken by the king 1 He is said to have subjugated 
the Magadai country, a name applied in mediaeval 
records to portions of Salem and Arcot districts, and it is 
quite possible that this was done in the course of the 
war against the Hoysalas and Kopperunjinga 2 The 
conquest of the Kongu country must have also resulted 
from the same campaigns, and there is very good reason 
to believe that the modern distncts of Salem and Coim- 
batore formed part of the Pandya emwre for some time 
after Sundara Pandya’ s reign 3 Lastly, Sundara Pandya

claims to have killed Gandagopala, occupied Kanchl- 
puram, defeated Ganapati the Kakatiya king, and 
performed a Vlrabhiseka m Nellore This is confirmed 
by some inscriptions (Nos 332, 340 and 361 of 1913) 
from Chidambaram which contain Tamil verses stating 
that Sundara Pandya ‘ inflicted a severe defeat on the 
Telungas at Mudugur, slaughtering them and their 
allies, the Aryas, right up to the bank of the Peraru and 
driving the Bana chief into the forest’ 1 All these 
references are apparently to various occurrences in the 
course of a single campaign against the ‘ northern 
kings’ , and if that be so, the reference to Ganapati would 
mean that the campaign was undertaken some time 
before AD 1260 The enemy against whom the cam- 
paign was primarily directed was Gandagdpala, a 
Telugu-Choda ruler who was m possession of Nellore 
and Kanchipuram The Bana chieftain and the Kaka- 
tlya king were perhaps the allies of Gandagopala whom 
Sundara Pandya did not pursue after they were repulsed 
in battle Gandagopala was however ‘ sent to the other 
world ’, as an inscription from Chidambaram records, 
and his territory was annexed to the Pandya empire and 
entrusted to his brothers who were apparently to rule as 
feudatories of the Pandya sovereign 2

* & in Tamil, \ol iv p 493 The identification of Gandagopala^and of 
the Ar> an allies of the Telungns presents considerable difficulty For 
the An, as, see Dr S K Aiyangar op cit , p 49, n 4, also the reference 
given in the preceding note It is not clear why Prof S K.r Aiyangar says 
1 the Aryar are referred to in connection with the Hoysalas In all the three 
references to them we have ’ I have tentatively assumed that it is a reference 
to Ganapiti and his forces which aided Gandagopala ° 

From the expression Vlragamj.agopd.la vipina diva dahana in the Sans- 
kri introduction, it has been assumed (e g ARE, 1916, part n, para 81 
and Appendix G) that the opponent of Jatavarman Sundara Pandya was 
Vragandagdpala But, the Tamil record speaks only of Gandagdpala 



JATAVARMAN SUNDARA PANDYA 169 

The wars of Sundara Pandya resulted in such an 
extension of his power that he assumed the imperial 
titles Maharajadiiaia-sriparamesvara and Einmandala- 
mum-kondai uliya They also brought him a vast 

treasure which he employed m beautifying the temples 
at Chidambaram and Srfrangam and endowing liberally 
these fwo famous shrines of fsiva and Visnu At 
Chidambaram Sundara Pandya is said to have performed 
several tulabh&i as and erected a ‘Golden Hall’ for 
Lord Nataraja 1 His gifts to the Srirangam temple 
and his building of parts of it are recorded in a 
long Sanskrit inscription which Hultzsch has sum- 
marized in the following words 2 ‘ He built a shrine of 

Narasimha and another of Visnu’s attendant Visvak- 
sena both of which were covered with gold, and a gilt 
tower which contained an image of Narasimha Further 
he covered the (original or central) shrine of the temple 
with gold, an achievement of which he must have been 
specially proud, as he assumed with reference to it 
the surname HemScchadana Raja le, “the king who 
covered the temple with gold ”, and as he placed m the 
shrine a golden image of Visnu which he called after 
his own new surname He also covered the inner wall 

(dsBiiejar SLppsezrL- GviruiretSsa- eSezrgpedQp QurrtsS ') and it is quite possi- 
ble that Vita ij the Sanskrit expression is not an integral part of the name 
At any rate ViragandagSpala of KanJhipnram (the son of Vijayaganda- 
gSpala) -jt'ho came to power about a d 1290 could not ha\ e been Sundara 
Pandja’s opponent And it seems likely that by disposing of his enemy 
Gandagopala, the Pandya became master both of Kanchipuram and of 
Nellore a'tid if t^ls assumption is confirmed by further evidence, it is quite 
possible that Sundara Pandya 's enem> was the most famous of the Ganda- 
gopalas, the first of the four mentioned m ARE, 1920, part it, para S3 
See Bu'terworth and Venugopanl Chetty, Nellore Inscriptions, (vol in,

of the central shrine with gold and built, in front of it, a 
dining hall, which he equipped with golden vessels. In 
the month of Caitra he celebrated the “ procession 
festival” of the God For the “festival of God’s sporting 
with Laksmi ” he built a golden ship. The last verse 
of the inscription states that the king built three golden 
domes over the image of Hemacchadana-Raja-Hari, 
over that of Garuda, and over the hall which contained 
the couch of Visnu The following miscellaneous 
gifts to Ranganatha are enumerated in the inscription — 
A garland of emeralds, a crown of jewels, a golden 
image of Sesa, a golden arch, a pearl garland, a canopy 
of pearls, different kinds of golden fruits, a golden car, 
a golden trough, a golden image of Garuda, a golden 
under-garment, a golden aureola, a golden pedestal, 
ornaments of jewels, a golden armour, golden vessels 
and a golden throne The first of the gifts which are 
here enumerated, appears to have suggested the surname 
Marakataprthvibhri , 1 e , the emerald king which is 
applied to Sundara Pandya in veise 13 ’ And this gar- 
land of emeralds was seized from the Kathaka (Kadava) 
king Kopperunjinga [vetse 4) Occasionally there are 
recorded in ihe inscriptions of this reign gifts to palhs 1 
and other religious institutions outside the pale of 
orthodox Hinduism, and this, taken along with the king’s 
liberal and impartial patronage of the shrines Of Siva and 
Visnu, maybe accepted as some indication of pqace in 
the religious life of the country. 

The epigraphs of this reign contain more direct refer- 
ences to the personal qualities of the monarch than is 
common in mediaeval Pandya records His loye of 
splendour and display is seen in the abhisekas (corona- 
tions) he held at Nellore and ^rirangam and m the

repeated tulsbhai as on various octasions at Chidambaram 
and Srlrangam. 1 Almost every verse in the Ranganatha 
inscription is calculated to impress this trait of the king 
on its readers, and he is repeatedly spoken of as ‘ the 
Sun ’ m expressions like RajasJlrya , Raj a- tap ana, Ksiti- 
pati Ravt, etc Some of the inscriptions from Chidam- 
baram* bestow special praise on the king’s peisonal 
courage in battle and on his skill in capturing fortresses 2 
T*hat he gloried m the extent of his empire may be 
inferred from his title K&nc/npura- Varad/iisvara m his 
Sanskrit introduction, corresponding to KanJiipuram 
Kondan of some Tamil records (No 64 of 1927) Sundara 
Pandya was very proud of the golden roofs he had made 
for the gods at Chidambaram and Srlrangam, and set up 
images called KdyilponmZyndapD umal in different parts 
of the realm in commemoration of the act and instituted 
special festivals to the images every month on the day of

been borne by this king, but by a later Sundara 
Pandya. 1 

Two princes are referred to in some records which 
certainly belong to the time of this Jatavarman Sundara 
Pandya, but their relation to the king is not quite clear 
One of them is Kulasekhara, who is called Annalvi in 
records of the ninth and tenth years of our king, 2 and 
is perhaps identical with the Kulasekhara for whose merit 
a mandapa was erected in Tirupputkuli by a minor chief- 
tain or an official who called himself PallavadhTsvara. 3 
It is possible that the reference in all these cases is to 
Jatavarman Kulasekhara II, as the expressions Ksitipa 
and Perumal are used m the Tirupputkuli epigraph. 
The otner person mentioned in the records of Sundara 
Pandya is a Vikrama Pandya who is referred to as 
N%yanai and in whose name a new village was founded 
in the thirteenth year of Jatavarman Sundara Pandya 4 
It has been suggested that a Maravarman Vikrama 
Pandya was ruling about this time with an initial date of 
about \ D. 1 249 and if that was so, he might be the Naya- 
itclr referred to. But more proof is required than is yet 
available before this suggestion can be finally accepted. 5

CHAPTER XII 


JATAV ARMAN VlRA PANDYA (ace A.u 1253) 
MARAVARMAN KULA6EKHARA (acc A d 1268) 

BEFORE we give an account of the times of Mafavarman 
Kulasekhara, another ruler who was contemporary yvith 
Jatavarman Sundara Pandya for the greater part of his 
reign must be noticed. This is Jatavarman Vira 
Pandya who takes credit for some of the successes won 
during the time of Jatavarman Sundara, and who perhaps 
carried out several expeditions under the direction of 
that monarch There are a considerable number of 
inscriptions that can definitely be ascribed to this Vira 
Pandya, and some of these indicate that he began his rule 
some time about the middle of A.D 1253 1 and continued 
to rule for at least twenty-two years till say A D 1274-5. 2 
It is not possible to fix the area of Vira Pandya’ s rule 
from the provenance of his inscriptions , though most of 
them come from Tinnevelly, Madura and Ramnad 
districts and the Pudukkottah state, we have stray 


1 Kielhorn and Sewell fix the accession between June 20 and July 4, 
a d 1253 (/ A , vol xliv, p 196) Mr L D Swaxnikkannu Pillai thought 
that Kielhorn’ s Vira Pandya was a Majmarman and that Ja$a\ arman Vira 
Pandya was another king who begrn his rule in a d 1254 \I A , vol xlil) 
According to Sewell the only inscription which seems to support this view 
is No 395 of 1909 and in it Majavarman is a mistake for Jatavarifian, as the 
achievements recorded in the epigraph are the same as those of Jatavarman 
(/ A , vol xliv, p 194 and n 16) The final position of the au.hor of the 
Indian Ephtmens on this question is far from clear He seems to 
postulate three Jatavarman Vira Pandyas with accession dates in A D 
1253, 1254 and 1280, and says also ‘ but this inference is not yet established-} 
b> indubitable proof ’ (vol 1, part 11, pp 95-7) Elsewhere he refers 395 of 
1909 to a Maravarman Vira Pandya of a later century (Pudukkottah 
inscription No 454 ) 

* No 128 of 1908 gives the twenty-second year, A d 1275, (Sewell).

records from other places like Kanchipuram (No. 483 of 
1919) and Coimbatore 1 We have in fact no means of 
knowing what exactly was the position ofVlra Pandya and 
rulers like him, ‘ co-regents’ as they have been called, 
and how- the administration of the empire was regulated 
The records of Jatavarman Vira Pandya begin in one 
of three* ways. The simplest form (eg 185 of 1895) 
gixps the jatavarman and Tnbhuvanacakravartin titles 
and refers to the conquests of Ilani, Kongu and the Chola 
kingdom, and the victory over Vallan and the aohiscka 
at Chidambaram before mentioning the king’s name and 
regnal year A slightly more elaborate form refers in 
like manner to the conquest of Kongu and flam, to the 
destruction of a hill ( kudu ) of the fierce Vadugas, the 
capture of the two banks of the Ganges ( ? ) and the 
Ka\eri, and the camping of the king in Chidambaram to 
collect the tribute from the Kadava and perform the 
ahJit^La 2 The most ostentatious of these introductions 
begins w ith the w r ords Tm/mapa/ Valai (fi^uiSGireuernr) 
and, while attributing incredible feats to Vira Pandya, 
seems to record some interesting particulars of the actual 
expeditions undertaken by the king against the Chola 
country and Ceylon We learn from this introduction 3

that Vira Pandya ‘ fought with the Chola king a battle 
at Kavikkalam, killed (in fight) one of the two kings of 
Ceylon, captured his army, chariots, treasures, throne, 
crown, necklaces, bracelets, parasols, chauns and other 
royal possessions, planted the Pandya flag with the 
double fish on the Konamalai and the high peaks of the 
Tnkutagiri mountain, and received elephants at tribute 
from the other king of Ceylon (whom, perhaps, f he 
raised to the throne) * Lastly the introduction ^refers 
to the king’s settlement of his relations with a Savan- 
maindan (^irevesretnuus^esr) who was at first recalcitrant 
but submitted afterwards. It is possible that these 
facts are implied also in the attribute given to Vira 
Pandya in an inscription in his tenth year which says 
4 he took the crown and the crowned head of fSavaka’ 
But the meaning of these references is by no means 
clear yet 1 However, most of these campaigns must be 
the same as those mentioned m the records of Jatavar- 
man Sundara Pandya, and if the statements' in these 
introductions of Vira Pandya are true, there can be no 
doubt that Vira played a decisive part m some of the 
most important achievements m Sundara Pandya’ s reign 
The conquest of Ceylon narrated in such detail is not 
mentioned in any records dated earlier than the tenth 
year of Vira Pandya. It should, however, be remembered 

1 There is only one text of this important record (Pudukkottah, glo 366) 
and in it the reference is in the following words (11 11-12)— ‘u [WJ

that Sundara Pandya is said to have collected a 
tribute of levels and elephants from the Ceylonese before 
the seventh year of his reign, that is, before AD 1258. 
The Ceylonese chronicles have nothing to tell of these 
transactions and it is not possible to determine how there 
came to be two kings m Ceylon and why one of 
them wr& selected by Vira Pandya for more favourable 
treatment than the other As for the places mentioned 
in connection with this evpedition, it has been suggested 
that Konamalai is very probably the same as Tirukkona- 
malai in the Tamtam and that Tnkutagin is the name 
applied to a three-peaked mountain m the Kandiyan 
country 1 Kavikkalam, the scene of the fight with 
the Chola, in which elephants appear to have played a 
decisive part {v 7 [afif)d)), is not easy to identify The 
only known Chola ruler of the time, Rajendra III, boasts 
of having taken the crowned heads of two Pandyas 
(No 515 of 1922) 

Vira Pandya’s conquest of Kongu is proved by the 
presence of a few of his records in the Coimbatore 
district 2 Who the Vallan was that was overcome by 
Vira Pandya before his coronation at Chidambaram, who 
the Vadugas were whose stronghold he destroyed, and 
where that stronghold was, are matters which, like many 
others relating to the history of the Pandya kings of this 
period, must be left unexplamed in the present state of

our knowledge. 1 The tributary and subordinate posi- 
tion in the Pandya Empire of the rebellious Kadava 
chieftain, Kopperunjingadeva, has been mentioned before. 

The records of Vira Pandya are of more than usual 
interest for a study of the social and economic condi- 
tions of the country during this period Though the 
more detailed study of such conditions has been reserved 
to a later chapter some of these records may be briefly 
noticed here One inscription from the Pudukkottah 
state (No. 372 of 1906) throws much light on judicial 
methods and describes an ordeal of the plough-share , 
another from Kurralam (Tinnevelly) registers a trans- 
action between an individual and the assembly of 
Tirukkuttalam which is stated to have met together in 
T irumukkalvattam, by which is probably meant a hall 
where it usually held its sittings ‘No. 432 of 1917 
records that the village assembly bought a piece of land 
from the people of Sundara Pandyapuram and let a por- 
tion of it on permanent lease to a certain Anda Pillai in 
exchange for a fixed annual rent in paddy and money on 
every mu (ui/r) of cultivated land.’ It was also stipulated 
that the lessee would pay on every ma of waste plot 
that he brought under cultivation an annually pro- 
gressive rate of rent for the first four years and a 
fixed rate thereafter 2 Two epigraphs from the North 
Arcot district (Avur, Nqs. 299 and 302: of 1919) 
contain details of kadamat assessment in that part of the

title ‘ who took all countries ’ had begun to rule, as his 
numerous records point to some day between the tenth 
and twenty-seventh June, A.D. 1268 as the date from 
which his regnal years were counted . 1 It is thus seen 
that there were at least three kings, Sundara Pandya, 
Vira Pandya and Kulasekhara, at this time. It will 
become clear from what follows that this feature “marked 
the whole of Kulasekhara’s reign and perhaps also the 
period that followed. A Maravarman V lkrama Pandya, 
two Jatavarman Sundara Pandyas and a Jatavarman Vira 
Pandya are known to have ruled with Maravarman 
Kulasekhara at different times, and there were possibly 
others like Maravarman Srfvallabha (acc A D.1257) and 
Jatavarman farivallabha (acc. A D. 1291) whose existence, 
though probable, has not been proved beyond doubt 2 
The evidence of foieign writers relating to this period 
confirms the inferences made from the inscriptions. 
Marco Polo, who visited part of the Pandya kingdom 
towards the end of the thirteenth century, speaks ol 
‘ live royal brothers ’ and ‘ five crowned kings ’ of this 
‘ great province of Ma’bar’. Chinese sources regard- 
ing the diplomatic intercourse with Ma’bar in 1280 and 
the following years mention ‘ the five brothers who were 


X IA, vol xliv and E I , vol x, p 141 Kielhorn’s view that this 
KulaSekhara was the immediate successor of Vira Pandya, the conqueror ot 
Ilam and Kongu, has now to be given up in view of records subsequently 
discovered 

2 Mr L D Swamikkannu Pillai first discovered the possibility of their 
existence and Mr Sewell after a careful examination of tys data' wanted 
further evidence before the existence of these kings could be taken as 
proved (7 A , vols xlii and xliv) Mr Swamikkannu Pillai also postulated a 
Sundara Pandya (Jatavarman) with accession date in a d 1270 ff (7 A , 
vol sin), but subsequently gave him up (List of Pudukkottah Inscriptions, 
p 66 n) The Indian kphemeris, however, introduces a Maravarman 
Sundara Pandya acc a d 1270 (vol i, part n, p 101) These instances 
show how difficult the chronology of these kings still continues to be.

Pandya empire must have been the result of the great 
extension of the empire during this period and an imita- 
tion of the practice of sending out princes of the royal 
family as viceroys which had prevailed in the Chola 
empire 

The insciiptions of Maravaiman Kulasekhara ‘ who 
conquered all countries ’ are very numerous ancf found 
mostly in the eastern Tamil districts and the regnal 
years mentioned in them range from 3 to 44. A few of 
these records begin with a historical introduction ‘ Ter 
Pol etc.’ which is not of much value as most of it is 
poetry The only definite statements made in it are that 
the tiger of the Cholas had been sent to rule the forests, 
that all religions flourished in friendly toleration of one 
another and that the rulers of various countries brought 
their tributes to the king 1 We also learn that the king 
had a palace at J ayangondasolapuram and that the king’s 
throne in the palace was called Kalingarayan. This is 
clear proof that the Cholas had ceased to exist as a 


1 Nos 25 of 1891 and 465 of 1909 of the years ten and four respectively 
Mr Krishna Sastri (at ARE, 1910, part u, para 36) holds that ' it is certain 
that he (KulaSekhara of No 465 of 1909) could not be identical -with 
Miravarman KulaSehhara I, "who was pleased to take every country ” ’ 
His reasons are (a) KulaSekhara * who conquered e\ery country’ is not 
known to have had any eulogy in the form of a historical introduction , 
(6) the mention of the chief officer Kalingarayan in the repord makes it 
probable that this Maravarman KulaSekhara was a contemporary or suc- 
cessor of Ja(avarman Srivallabha, and (c) the historical introduction was 
characteristic of the records of the first kings of the mediaeval Pandyas 
Reasons (a) and (c) simply beg the question As for (6), Mr Krishna Sastri 
himself ascribes another record No 366 of 1913 to KulaSekhpra ' who took 
all countries ’ for the very reason that it mentions Kalingarayan (ARE, 
1914, part ii, para 22) That No 465 of 1909 does not give the title ‘ who took 
all countries ’ is no argument against its being ascribed to the kin& , for 
when there is a characteristic introduction to a record, the king’s surnames 
ma\ or rnaj not appear See Jatavarman Sundara’s records beginning

power The last of them who made any attempt to save 
the Chola line from annihilation was Rajcndra III and 
he had probably ceased to rule when Maravarman Kula- 
sekhara came to the throne 1 An epigraph from 
SermadeM (No 602 of 1916) dated in the twentieth year 
of the king furnishes some commcntar) on his title and 
mentions that lie conquered the Malainadu, Sonadu, the 
two Kongus, Tlam and Tondaimandalam These are 
probably references to campaigns rendered necessary o i 
account of some local trouble or other, for most of the 
territories mentioned had been brought undei subjection 
b) Jat'ivarman Sundara Pnnd\a and Vira Pandya 

Rather carh in his reign the king went on an expedi- 
tion against the Travancorc country (Malainadu) and 
one of the chief incidents in the campaign was probably 
the capture of kollam (Quilon) Some records of the 
king from the TinncvcJh district confirm the conquest, 
rather the reconquest, of Malainadu, and give the titles 
Chnnrn vn ra and KoUant-Kottda 2 That Kulasekhara 
continued to be in undisputed possession of the Sonadu 
and Tondaimandalam is proved by the presence of many 
of his inscriptions in all the important places in these 
districts In spite of Kulasekhara’s claim to have con- 
quered the two Kongus, no records of his are found 
in the Kongu country On the other hand, a record 
from Tinna\el!) (No. 29 of 1927) mentions 3 that Kula- 
sekhara built a foiiJtata wall of the Tinnevelly temple

from the booty collected after defeating the Kerala, the 
Chola and the Hoysala kings Another inscription 
mentions that the king was in his camp at Kannanur in 
his fifteenth year. 1 We also find records of Kula- 
sekhara’s co-regent Jatavarman Sundara Pandya (ace. 

\ d 1276) in the Kongu country, and later still, early 
in the fourteenth century, the Muhammadan historians 
tell us of a Pandya ruler with his headquarters at Kalul 
(Karur) 2 All these facts leave little room for doubt 
that the Kongu country was more or less effectively 
controlled by the Pandya rulers till the end of Kula- 
sekhara’s reign 

The conquest of Ceylon is borne out by the Mahuvamsa 
and appears to have taken place about A.D 1284, when 
Parakrama Bahu III was ruling the island 3 ‘ Then 

there arose a famine m the land (Ceylon). Then the 
five brethren who governed the Pandyan kingdom sent 
to this island, at the head of an army, a great minister 
of much power who was a chief among the Tamils known 
as Ariya Cakkavatti, albeit he was not an Anya. And 
when he had landed and laid waste the country on ever) 
side he entered the great and noble fortress, the city of

unto the king Kulasekhara who was even like unto a 
sun expanding the lotus-like race of the great Pandyan 
kings ’ 1 The commander of the Pandyan forces men-

also in an inscription (No. no of 1903) of the king in 
his thirty-seventh year as taking his orders from him 2 
Paj-akrama Bahu had to bow before the storm and the 
MaJmvcurna says that he adopted persuasive methods 
with the Pandya monarch, visited the Pandyan court

that time neither any foreign enemy entered his country 
nor any severe malady confined him to bed ’. ‘ The 

fortunate and happy sovereign ’ according to the same 
writer, ‘ enjoyed a highly prosperous life ’ We have 
evidence from the inscriptions, however, of a short period 
of illness from which the king suffered and which appears 
to have had rather important consequences in the public 
administration of the country In an epigraph from the 
Tanjore district (No. 46 of 1906) 3 dated in the thirty- 
fourth year of the king, ‘ the country is said to have been

brought about by the king making over a portion of his 
dominions to his younger brothers Kulasekhara ap- 
parently resumed the ceded territories subsequently. As 
a result of this step, the people, who had migrated to 
other provinces in the interval, returned to their native 
country \ Another inscription 1 dated about three years 
earlier in the thirty-first year which records a gift 1 of land 
for the recovery of the king from some illness probably 
explains the circumstances which led to the events men- 
tioned in the later inscription 

Kulasekhara appears to have had the surname Bhit- 
vanekavlra which is found in at least one of his records, 
if not more . 2 There are references, in the records of 
Kulasekhara and his contemporary Vira Pandya, to a 
number of chieftains with names ending in Vanadirayan 
or Mabeli Vanadirayan. These are among the earliest 
references in Pandya records to a race of feudatories who 
seem at first to have started as hereditary local officials 
in charge of the administration of portions of the king- 
dom In later times, the Vanadirayans in the Madura 
country look advantage of the growing weakness of the 
Pandyan kings to declare their independence and restrict 
the actual rule of the later Pandyas to the Tinnevelly 
district It would appear that these local officials so 
long as they retained a subordinate character indicated 
their subjection by employing the names of princes of 
the ruling family as their aliases. The fsambuva/ayans 
who were Chola feudatories are known to have done so , 3 
and the names of the Mabehvanadirayans mentioned m 
the Pandya records under reference are best explained on

thirty first year (/ A , vol xliv, p 198)

MARCO POLO 

OF the co-regents who came to power after Kulasekhara’s 
accession, Jatavarman Sundara Pandya claims notice 
first His rule began m AD. 1276. 1 This king had 
apparently no distinguishing titles and the identifi- 
cation of his records is a matter of considerable 
difficulty. There is little to guide the student besides 
astronomical details given m the inscriptions and the 
latest regnal year so far traced by such indications is the 
seventeenth, which takes his rule up to AD 1292-1293 
(No. 594 of 1907) He is the Sonder Bandi Davar of 
Marco Polo and the Sunder Pandi of Wassaf who was the 
Dewar ‘ a few years since 1 and whose death is mentioned 
by him as having occurred in 692 Hijra. His records 
aie found in the Cuddapah and Salem districts, besides 
Tanjore, South Arcot and Chingleput An inscription 
of his, recently discovered inthe Tanjore district (No. 31 1 
of 1927), refers to the foundation of a new £aiva Matha by 
a Vidyasiva Pandita, which is no doubt connected with

SOCIAL LIFE MARCO POLO

Before proceeding to consider the other co-regents of 
Kulasekhaia and the politics of the closing years of his 
reign, an account must be given of the social and economic 
life of the Band) a country as it struck a foreign observer 
like Marco Polo, whose statements are in several import- 
ant respects borne out by the observations of the 
Muhanfmadan historian Wassaf to whom we owe much of 
ouj- knowledge of the political condition of the Pandyan 
kingdom at this time 1 

The name by which the country w T as known to 
foreigners was Ma'bar, a wmrd wduch, in Arabic, signi- 
fies Passage or Ferry and was applied to the part of 
the Indian coast most frequented by travellers and mer- 
chants from Arabia and the Persian Gulf ‘ Ma’bar 
extends m length from Kulam (Quilon) to Nilaw^ar 
(Nellore) The curiosities of Chin and Machin and the 
beautiful products of Hind and Sind, laden on large 
ships (which they call junks), sailing like mountains 
with the wings of the wunds on the surface of the w r ater, 
arc alw aj s arriving there The wealth of the Isles of 
the Persian Gulf in particular, and in part the beauty 
and adornment of other countries, fiom Irak and 
Khurasan as far as Rum and Europe, are derived from 
Ma’bar, which is so situated as to be the key of Hind ’ 
[IVassaf) Writing of Kayal (Call), the chief emporium 
of the Paralyan kingdom, Marco Polo says that the king 
to whom the city belongs ‘ administers his kingdom 
with great equity and extends great favour to merchants 
and foreigners, so that they are very glad to visit his 
city ’ ‘ It is at this city that all the ships touch that 

comq from the West, as from Hormos and from Kis and

and Elliot and Dowson, vol iii,

should happen to die, the value of them should be paid 
from the royal treasury ' 1 

The waste of the country’s wealth on horses that 
Marco Polo speaks of was due not so much to the 
generous terms of the contract under which horses were 
imported as to the unfavourable climate of South India 
in which these horses could not thrive and the 
ignorance of Indian horse-keepers Wassaf remarks 
'It is a strange thing that when those horses arrive 
there, instead of giung them raw r barley they give them 
roasted baric) and grain dressed with butter, and boiled 
cow-’s milk to drink . They bind them for forty 
dajs m a stable with ropes and pegs in order that they 
nw) get fat , and afterwards, without taking measuies 
for training, and without stirrups and other appurte- 
nances of riding, the Indian soldiers ride upon them 
like demons . In a short time, the most strong, 
swift, fresh and active horses become weak, slow r , use- 
less, and stupid. In short, they all become wretched 
and good for nothing There is, therefore, a 

constant nccesstt} of getting new- horses annually ’ 
Marco Polo confirms Wassaf and says, ' There is no 
possibility of breeding horses in this country, as hath 
often proved by trial ’ and the ‘ people do not know in 
the least how' to treat a horse ’ But he also adds this 
' The hor^ti-merchants not only' never bring any farriers 
with them, but also prevent any farrier from going 
thither, lest that should m any degree baulk the sale of 
horses’, wln.ch brings them in every' year such vast gains ’ 

* Wassaf also gives the total \olumc of the annual Indian import trade 
in hordes ns 10,000 animals worth 2,200,000 dinars and rather inconsistently 
ndds that this amount 'was pmd out of the overflowing revenues of the 
estates and endowments belonging to the Hindu temples, and from the tax 
upon courtesans attached to them, and no charge was incurred by the 
public treasury ’

11*1 'I HE PAXDYAN KINGDOM 

from the earliest times the Pandya country has been 
famous tor its pearls and ‘ Marco's account of the pearl 
t”i«hcr} is still substantial!} correct ’ He says ‘ In his 
(Snnder Bandi Davar’s) kingdom they find very fine 
and great pearls, and I will tell you how they are 
got . . The pearl-fishers take their vessels, great 

and small, and proceed into this gulf (between the 
island of Sedan and the mainland), where they stop from 
the beginning of April till the middle of May. The) go 
fir-t to a place called Bettclar, and (then) go sixty miles 
into the gulf Here they cast anchor and shift from 
their large vessels into small boats. You must know 
that the many merchants who go divide into various 
companies, and each of these must engage a number of 
men on wage*:, hiring them for April and half of May 
Of all the produce they have first to pay the King, as his 
r<nalt>, the tenth part And they must also pay those 
men who charm the great fishes, to prevent them from 
injuring the divers whilst engaged in seeking pearls 
under v ater, one-twentieth part of all that they take 
The^e fish-charmers are termed Abrataman (Brahman) , 
in 1 their charm holds good for that day only, for at 
night th f *> dissolve the charm so that the fishes can

thence in fact come the pearls which are spread all over 
the world And I can tell you the King of that State 
hath a very great receipt and treasure from his dues 
upon those pearls.’ ‘ Moreover nobody is permitted to 
take out of the kingdom a pearl weighing more than half 
a saggio unless he manages to do it secretly This order 
has been given because the King desires to reserve all 
such to himself , and so in fact the quantity he has is 
something almost incredible Moreover several times 
every year he sends his proclamation through the realm 
that if any one who possesses a pearl or stone of great 
value will bnng it to him, he will pay for it twice as 
much as it cost Everybody is glad to do this, and thus 
the King gets all into his own hands, giving every man 
his price ’ 

The king possessed much other treasure of great 
value besides the best of the pearls that were found in 
his kingdom ‘ Round his neck he has a necklace entirely 
of precious stones, rubies, sapphires, emeralds and the 
like in so much that this collar is of great value He 
wears also hanging in front of his chest from the neck 
downwards, a fine silk thread strung with 104 (108 ?) 
large pearls and rubies of great price The reason why 
he wears this cord with the 104 great pearls and rubies, 
is (according to what they tell) that every day, morning 
and evenifig, he has to say 104 prayers to his idols 
Such 15 their religion and their custom And thus did 
all the Kings, his ancestors before him, and they bequeath- 
ed thS strijig of pearls to him that he should do the 
like.’ 

‘ The King aforesaid also wears on his arms three 
golden bracelets thickly set with pearls of great value, 
and anklets also of like kind he wears on his legs, and 
rings on his toes likewise. So let me tell you what this 



196 THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 

King wears, between gold and gems and pearls, is worth 
more than a city’s ransom. And it is no wonder , for he 
hath great store of such gear ’ 

‘ When the King dies none of his children dares to 
touch his treasure. For they say, “As our father did 
gather together all this treasure, so we ought to accumu- 
late as much in our turn ” And in this way incomes 
to pass that there is an immensity of treasure accumu- 
lated in this kingdom.’ That Marco was correctly 
informed as to the extent of the treasures accumulated 
by the Pandya rulers is seen clearly from the statements 
of Wassaf on the matter. Of Kales Dewar (Kulasekhara) 
he says ‘ His coffers were replete with wealth, inasmuch 
that in the treasury of the city of Mardi (Madura) there 
were 1,200 crores of gold {dinars) deposited . Be- 
sides this there was an accumulation of precious stones, 
such as pearls, rubies, turquoises and emeralds — more 
than is in the power of language to express ’ 

Marco Polo gives some more information of interest 
about the king and his court ‘ This King hath some 
five hundred wives. . The King hath many child- 
ren ’ ‘And there are about the King a number of Barons 
in attendance upon him These ride with him, and 
keep always near him, and have great authority in the 
kingdom , they are called the King’s Trusty Lieges 
And you must know that when the King dies, and they 
put him on the fire to burn him, these Lieges cast r them- 
selves into the fire round about his body, and suffer them- 
selves to be burnt along with him For th$y say they 
have been his comrades in this world, and that they ought 
also to keep him company m the other world ’ These 
statements of Marco about the King’s Trusty Lieges 
may, at first sight, appear incredible , but they furnish an 
excellent commentary on the epigraphical references to 



SOCI\L LIFE >jARCO POLO 397 

Tcnnavan Apattudai'i^al (Q pm aetr) and 
an institution mentioned m the records of successive 
Pandya rulers of this period 1 becomes intelligible only 
in the light of the evidence furnished by the Venetian 
traveller. 

Marco Polo has some things to say about the life of 
the coihmon people of the country. Their manner of 
dress seems to have amazed him ‘ You must know 
that in all this province of Ma’bar there is never a tailor 
to cut a coat or stitch it, seeing that everybody goes 
naked 1 For dccenc) only do they wear a scrap of 
cloth, and so it is with men and women, with rich and 
poor, a)e, and with tne King himself . . It is a 

fact that the King goes as bare as the rest.’ The last 
statement shows that surprise at the novelty of the 
foreigners' dress blunted the keenness of the traveller’s 
observation Marco Polo mentions the custom of saft as 
common at f he time and refers also to the practice of 
f allowing a condemned criminal who was sentenced to 
death to sacrifice himself to some God or other of his 
choice Many people, according to him, worshipped the 
ox and 1 would not eat beef for anything in the world ’ 

* And let me tell you, the people of this country 
have a custom of rubbing their houses all over with cow- 
dung. Moreover all of them, great and small, King and 
Barons included, do sit upon the ground only, and the 
reason they give is that this is the most honourable way 
to sit, because we all spring from the Earth and to the 
Earth* we must return , so no one can pay the Earth too 
much honour, and no one ought to despise it ’ People 
v continue to sit on the ground even now, though, one 
supposes, not for the reason given by Marco

1 The people of the countiy go to battle all naked, 
with only a lange and a shield , and they are most 
wretched soldiers. They will kill neither beast nor bird, 
nor anything that hath life , and for such animal food as 
they eat, they make the Saracens, or others who are not 
of their own religion, play the butcher. 

‘ ‘ It is their practice that every one, male and female, 

do wash the whole body twice every day , and those wl?o 
do not wash are looked on much as we look on the 
Patanns You must know that m eating they use the 
right hand only and would on no account touch their food 
with the left hand. So also they drink only from 

drinking vessels, and every man hath his own , nor will 
any one drink from another’s vessel And when they 
drmk the> do not put the vessel to the lips, but hold it 
aloft and let the drink spout into the mouth No one 
would on any account touch the vessel with his mouth, 
nor give a stranger drink with it But if the stranger have 
no vessel of his own they will pour the drink into his 
hands and he may thus drink from his hands as from a 
cup 

‘ They are very strict in executing justice upon crimi- 
nals, and as strict in abstaining from wine. Indeed they 
have made a rule that wine-drinkers and sea-faring men 
are never to be accepted as sureties. . They 

have the following rule about debts If a debtor shall 
have been several times asked by his creditor fo/ pay- 
ment and shall have put him off from day to day with 
promises, then if the creditor can once meet ( the debtor 
and succeed m drawing a circle round him, the latter 
must not pass out of this circle until he shall have satis- 
fied the claim, or given security for its discharge If he in 
any other case presumes to pass the circle he is punished 
with death as a transgressor against right and justice.

‘ They have many experts m an art which the} 
call Physiognomy, by which they discern a man’s 
character and qualities at once They also know the 
import of meeting with any particular bird or beast , for 
such omens are regarded by them more than b} any 
people m the world . As soon as a child is 

born they write down his nativity, that is to say the day 
and hour, the month, and the moon’s age This custom 
they observe because every single thing they do is done 
with reference to astrology, and by the advice of diviners 
skilled in Sorcery and Magic and Geomancy and such 
like diabolical arts , and some of them are also acquainted 
with Astrology ’ 

Marco Polo says that all male children were dismis- 
sed from their homes when they attained thirteen and 
after that they had to get their living by trade ‘ And 
these urchins are running about all day from pillar to 
post, buying and selling . And every day they 
take their food to their mothers to be cooked and served, 
but do not eat a scrap at the expense of their fathers ’ 
This could not have been universal , perhaps Marco 
found the system prevailing among some sections of the 
population He refers to temples as ‘ certain abbeys m 
which are Gods and Goddesses to whom many)oung 
girls are consecrated ’ — a reference to dtvadasts The 
nature of ^:he institution of- the temple dancing-girls 
seems, ^however, to have been hardly understood b} the 
traveller 

‘ All the people of this city (Cail), as well as of the 
rest of India, have a custom of perpetually keeping m

tain habit and desire they have, continualh chewing it 
and spitting out the saliva that it excites The Lords and 
gentlefolks and the King have these leaies prepared

with camphor and other aromatic spices and also mixt 
with quicklime. And this practice was said to be very 
good for the health.’ 

‘ The men of this country have their beds made of 
very light canework, so arranged that, when they have 
got in and are going to sleep, they are drawn up by 
cords nearly to the ceiling and fixed there for thb night. 
This is done to get out of the way of tarantulas wfych 
give terrible bites, as well as of fleas and such vermin, 
and at the same time to get as much air as possible m 
the great heat which prevails m that region Not that 
everybody does this, but only the nobles and great 
folks, for the others sleep on the streets.’

sies and rivalries of these half-brothers embittered the 
last years of Kulasekhara, and finally led to his murder 
by Sundara Pandya This crime was followed by a 
fraternal war which threw the kingdom into confusion 
when the Khilji army under Malik Kafur advanced 
upon Madura But the story is not easy to follow in its 
details It is unfortunate that Wassaf’s account stands 
alone and is not corroborated by the other writers of the 
time, particularly because the inscriptions of Kulase- 
khara’ s reign seem to contradict Wassaf’s chronology 
The story as given by Wassaf is this ‘As Tira 
Pandi was remarkable for his shrewdness and intrepidity, 
the ruler nominated him as his successor His brother 
Sundar Pandi, being enraged at this supersession, killed 
his father, in a moment of rashness and undutifulness, 
towards the close of the year 709 H (AD. 1310) and 
placed the crown on his head in the city of Mardi 
(Madura) He induced the troops who were there to 
support his interests, and conveyed some of the royal 
treasures which were deposited there to the city of Man- 
kul, and he himself accompanied, marching on, attended 
in royal pomp with the elephants, horses, and treasures 
Upon this his brother Tira Pandi, being resolved on 
avenging his father’s blood, followed to give him battle, 
and on the margin of a lake which, in their language, 
they call Talachi, the opponents came to actron Both 
the brothers, each ignorant of the fate of the other, fled 
away , but Tira Pandi being unfortunate, and having 
been wounded, fell into the hands of the enem> , and 
seven elephant-loads of gold also fell to the' lot of the 
army of Sundar Pandi. 

‘ It is a saying of philosophers, that ingratitude will, 
sooner or later, meet its punishment, and this was proved 
in the sequel, for Manar Barmul, the son of the daughter

of Kales Dewar, who espoused the cause of Tira 
Pandi, being at that time at Karamhatti, near Kalul, sent 
him assistance, both in men and money, which was 
attended with a most fortunate result Sundar Pandi 
had taken possession of the kingdom, and the army and 
the Lreasure were his own , but, . . notwithstanding 

all his*treasures and the goodwill of the army, he* 

m,et with the chastisement due to his ingratitude, for in 
the middle of the year 710 (A D 1310) Tira Pandi, hav- 
ing collected an army, advanced to oppose him, and 
Sundar Pandi, trembling and alarmed, fled from his 
native country, and took refuge under the protection of 
Ala-ud-din of Delhi, and lira Pandi became firmly 
established in his hereditary kingdom ’ 

Now, the two princes Vlra Pandya and Sundara 
Pandya had been associated in the government of the 
state since A D 1296 and 1303 respectively, and if 
Sundara Pandya’s superior claims were overlooked, the 
supersession took place several years before Sundara’ s 
rage led him to kill his father It is hard to see why 
Sundara Pandya, who apparently did not mind the pre- 
ference shown to Viram the beginning, should, at the end 
of more than thirteen years, have become so undutiful as 
to turn parricide it is, however, possible that some time 
before the murder, Kulasekhara had in some manner 
indicated that after him, yira Pandya was to be the 
chief monarch, Sundara Pandya being subordinate in 
rank, and that Sundara was disappointed at this decision 
of his father which placed the bastard above the legiti- 
mate son after the father’s lifetime. 1 But the time of 
the 9 murder as given by Wassaf presents a serious diffi-

culty. The event is placed by him at the close of 709 
H., that is about May-June, A.D. 1310, and before Malik 
Kafur’s attack on Dwarasamudra. But there are inscrip- 
tions which refer to the forty-fourth year of Kulasekhara’s 
reign which did not begin till June 10, AD. 1311 
and one of these (No 106 of 1916) comes from Tirukkala- 
kkudi m the modern Ramnad district and gives the 
king’s usual title * who was pleased to take all countries’. 
It is very unlikely that records continued to be dated m 
the regnal years of a monarch who had died at his son’s 
hands till more than a year after the event, and that so 
near the capital of the kingdom There seems to be no 
possibility of reconciling Wassaf’s date with the epigra- 
phical evidence at hand. 1 It may also be observed that 
neither Amir Khusru nor Zia-ud-din Barm — both refer to 
the two rulers of the Pandya country in their accounts of 
Malik Kafur’s invasion of Ma’bar — ‘has anything to say 
about the murder. 

There is no doubt, however, that Vira Pandya and 
Sundara Pandya had fallen out and were fighting each 
other at the time of the Muhammadan invasion of South 
India. In this respect, Wassaf’s statements receive 
confirmation from Amir Khusru who says that Malik 
Kafur ‘was informed that the two Rais of Ma’bar, the 
eldest named Bir Pandya, the youngest Sundar Pandya, 
who had up to that time continued on frieridly terms, 
had advanced against each other with hostile r inten- 
tions.’ 2 It is difficult to follow the details of this war 
between the two Pandya rulers given by W?ssaf ks the

names of places have changed beyond recognition at 
the hands of the Muhammadan historian 

Sundara Pandya is said to have suffered defeat 
in the end and taken lefuge with Ala-ud-dm This 
has led practically all historians to suppose that Sundara 
Pandya s appeal against Vlra furnished the occasion 
for Malik Kafur’s invasion of the Pandya country Col 
Yule stated ' Sundar I3andi went to Ala-ud-din, Sultan 
of Delhi, and sought help The Sultan eventually sent 
Ins general Harardmari {ahai Malik Kafur) to conquer 
Ma'bar' 1 and he has been generally followed by all 
writers w ho came after him and it has been sometimes 
assumed that Malik Kafur s invasion of the Pandya 
kingdom was undertaken partly in furtherance of Sundara 
Pandya’s claims to the throne 2 There seems to be 
little reason furnished by our sources for the view that 
the Muhammadan was interested in helping Sundara 
Pandya back to his throne or that his invasion was caused

by the quarrels between the brothers. Wassaf, the only 
writer who gives a full account of the disputed succession 
m the Pandya country, does not connect Malik Kafur’s 
invasion with the flight of Sundara Pandya to Ala-ud- 
din’s court in fact his account of the invasion of Ma’bar 
precedes his narrative of the fraternal war in the Pandya 
kingdom and his scheme of chronology is likewise' against 
the usual view. He places the invasion of Ma’bar in 
the month of Rajab of the year 710 H. (December, A.D. 
1310) and the flight of Sundara to Ala-ud-din was after the 
middle of the year 710, that is about the same time. It 
is possible to suggest that Sundara fled not to Ala-ud-din 
himself but to his general in the south, Malik Kafur, and 
sought his aid 1 This does seem a satisfactory solution 
of the chronological difficulty. But if W assaf ’s account is 
to be followed iaithiuily, it must be held thd.t Sundara 
Pandya did not gam much by his appeal to Malik Kafur. 
Por he leaves no room lor doubt that Malik Kafur’s^ 
invasion of the Pandya country had no other results than 
the plunder of some cities, and that the attack on the 
Pandya ruler who actually held sway at the time was 
substantially a failure. ‘Some of the towns were obtained 
through the animosity which has lately arisen between the 
two brothers, when at last a large army, attended by 
numerous elephants of war, was sent out to oppose the 
Muhammadans. Malik Nabu, who thought* himself a 
very Saturn, was obliged to retreat, and bring back his 
army.’ 2 In fact the expressions used by Wassaf in this 
passage, specially the words ‘ the animosity,, which has 
lately arisen between the two brothers’, seem to indicate 
that so tar as Malik Kafur was concerned he made no

an appeal from him, and they say nothing as to the effects 
of the invasion on the relative position of the two royal 
brothers of the Pandya country. There is thus no reason 
to suppose that Sundara Pandya was restored to the 
throne of Madura and that a Muhammadan garrison was 
left behind in the city for his protection 1 
' In fact, the epigraphical records of Vira Pandya and 
Sundara Pandya and their successors give the impres- 
sion of a more or less continuous rule of the Pandya 
country by them and we have records of Vira and 
Sundara dated a few years after the withdrawal of Malik 
Kafur 2 The only effect of Malik Kafur’s inroad was to 
add to the confusion m the country already distracted 
by the civil war among the rulers of the land. The real 
Muhammadan conquest of South India came later, and 
even then it was short-lived and ineffective Within

the two kings of Ma’bar conquered, and plundered by MankoNaib The 
attempt to extract history from the confused chronicles in the Taylor MSS

privation that must have been the lot of the common 
people at this time. The loss in wealth was real. The 
country was drained of its treasure by the trade of the 
Arabs from acioss the sea and the plunder of the armies 
of the Sultans of Delhi Wassaf tells us that a certain 
‘ eminent prince ’ Takiuddin occupied high positions of 
power and prestige in the administration of the country 
under the Sundara Pandya, who died about A. D. 1292, 
and for sometime afterwards 1 Barm laments the rapa- 
city and villainy of Khusru Khan which did not spare 
even a Muhammadan merchant Taki Khan whose great 
wealth was taken fiom him by force, himself being after- 
wards put to death. 2 The desecration of temples by the 
invading hosts and the hoiror with which their acts of 
vandalism filled the minds of the people who had till 
then been strangers to such sights, are occasionally 
evidenced by the inscriptions Two of these come from 
Tirupputtur (Ramnad district) 3 and are dated in the 
forty-fourth and forty-sixth years of Jatavarman Vlra 
Pandya, that is, about A D 1339-41 These records give 
an account of the reconsecration of a Siva temple and the 
gratitude of the villagers to the magnate who undertook 
the task and completed it ‘ The temple of Tiruttali- 
yanda-Nayanar at Tirupputtui is stated to have been 
occupied by the encamped Muhammadans (Tulukkar), 
“whose time it was”, and' to have been ruined. In 
consequence of this the inhabitants ofTnupputtur became 
unsettled At this juncture a certain Visayalayadevar 
of Kuraikkudi (^uraikkudi?), surnamed Avaiyan Pe'nya- 
nayanar, reconsecrated the temple and saved the people

apparently from an imminent moral and leligious 
degradation The villagers of Tirupputtur, of their free 
will, agreed among themselves to show their gratitude to 
Vvsay.ilayadeva by assigning to him a specified quantity 
of corn from the harvest reaped by each individual, and 
to confer on him ceitain pnvileges in the temple of 
Tirutt6h)anda-Na}anar ’ 

Malik Kafur’s inroad into the Madura country, though 
it did not bring the Pandya territories into subjection 
to the Sultanate of Delhi, nevertheless marked the begin- 
ning of the end of the Second Empire of the Pandyas 
The effects of the disputed succession and the Muham- 
madan invasion are seen in the subjection, however 
temporary, of the Pandyas to their Kerala contemporary , 
Ravivarman Kulasekhara, followed by the permanent 
loss of the northern districts of the Tamil land to the 
Kakatiya ruler of the l'elugu country and the growing 
independence of the feudatories of the Pandya kingdom 
From this time on, the history of the Pandyas becomes 
the story of a piogressive decline which ends in the 
restriction of their sway to portions of the Tinnevelly 
district and, towards the close of the sixteenth centuiy, 
in their final disappearance from the pages of history 

Ravivarman Kulasekhaia 1 — also called Sangramadhlia 
‘firm in battle’ — ruled in Travancore with Quilon as 
his capital He came to power about \ D. 1311-1312 and 
was almost the only South Indian monarch who was left 
untouched by the storm of Malik Kafur’s raid This 
immunity left him at an advantage over his neighbours 
when Mafik Kafur turned his back on South India, and

he made the best use of his position. His inscriptions 
are found in Srlrangam, Kanchipuiam and Poonamallee, 
which last bears the name Cher a- Pandya- Cat urvedi- 
maiigalam In his Kanchlpuram inscription dated m 
the fourth year of his reign, AD. 131 5—13 1 claims to 
have defeated Vira Pandya, made the Pandyas and Cholas 
'subject to the Keralas and at the age of forty-six (i.e 
about A. D 1 3 1 2- r 3 1 3) to have been crowned on the banjts 
of the Vegavati 1 ‘ The grantha inscription engraved 

in Poonamallee (No 34 of 1911) states that the Chera 
king conquered Sundara Pandya and granted the village 
Chera- Pandya-Caturvedi-mangalam for the enjoyment of 
the Brahmins. The figure of a fish surmounted by an 
aithusa, i.e ‘ the elephant’s goad, which is depicted on 
the right margin of the record (No. 33 of 191 1), also 
indicates the subjection of the Pandya king by the 
Chera ’ 2 Thus both Vira Pandya and Sundara Pandya 
were conquered by Ravivarman Kulasekhara and these 
kings could have been no other than the two unfortunate 
sons of Maravarman Kulasekhara. 3 


1 Mr Venkayya’s doubts {ARE, 1900, para 15) as to how Ravivarman 

Kulasekhara was able to accomplish so much in the face of the Muham- 
madans who would have been very strong in Madura at this time have been 
met by our view of the invasion of Malik Kafur Kielhorn and Hultzscb 
identified the Vegavati with ‘ a small river which flows into the Palaru near 
Kanchlpuram’ {El , vol. iv, p 146) But there seems to be no great diffi- 
culty in taking it to be the better known river in the Mad\i.a district 
Another inscription seems to imply that a d 1313 fell m the fourth year 
of the king’s reign (E l , vol vm, p f 

2 If this is correct, Garudadhvaia in 1 5 of the Arulalaperumal mscrip 
tion {E 1 , vol iv, p 147) must perhaps be rendered ‘ Gaj-uda column ’ 
rather than * Garuda banner ’ as Kielhorn does (See ARE, 1911, part n, 
para 40 ) 

3 There may be some doubt as to the identity of Vira Pandya butfnone 
as to that of Sundara There seem to have been two Vira Pandyas among 
the foes of Ravivarman One of them was the Pandya king whose accession 
•was in a d 1296-7 , the other possibly a ruler of Venad who seems to have 
sought refuge in Konkan ( E l , vol iv, p 148 and note 4 on p 146) 



THE MUHAMMADAN INVASION 2i3 

The Kerala ruler, however, was not for long left m the 
enjoyment of the fiuits of his victory For very soon 
after, he seems to have been ousted from Kanchipura by 
the advance of Muppidi Nayaka the lord of Vikrama- 
simhapattana, that is, probably the governor of Nellore, 
and the general of the Kakatlya king Prataparudradeva 
He is ^aid to have conquered a Pandya king and levied ■ 
a tribute of elephants from him This king might have 
been Sundara Pandya as a record in his fourteenth year 
states that he instituted a service called aftei Muppidi 
Nayaka id the temple at Vnddhacalam (South Arcot) 
Muppidi is said to have installed a governor at Kanchipura 
by name Manavira This expedition of the Kakatlya 
general seems therefore to have brought the northern 
part of the Pandya empire for a time under the control, 
more or less effective, of the Telugu rulers of Orangal 1 

These defeats at the hands of foreign invaders fOllow- 
mg so quickly upon one another must have shaken 
the hold of the Pandya rulers on the territories they 
subjugated and held during the thirteenth century out- 
side the Pandya country proper It is not possible to 
trace fully the steps by which this disintegration was 
brought about, but we see, about this time, signs of the 
growing feeling among the feudatories of the ikmgdom 
that they might ignore the central power with impunity 
One of the Sambuvarayas of North Arcot, who were at 
first subject to the Cholas and later became the depend- 
ants 0? the Pandya rulers, Kulasekhara Sambuvaraya, 
set up as an independent ruler at this time and began to 
date his inscriptions in his own regnal years This 
Sambuvaraya apparently acknowledged the authority 
of Vira Pandya till the twenty-second year of his reign,

that is, till about A.D. 1317-18 and subsequently declared 
himself independent We are not, however, in a position 
to fix the exact date from which he counted his regnal 
yeais and began to issue orders m his own name showing 
the attainment of an independent or quasi-independent 
status by him 1 It may be mentioned in passing that 
•-another feudatory of the Pandya rulers of this period was 
Semapillai, the son of Rajendra III and almost the last 
representative of the Chola line His inscriptions come 
largely from the region of the modern Pudukkottah 
state 2 

A few remarks on Jatavarman Sundara Pandya {ace 
A D 1302 - 1303 ) remain to be offered The latest regnal 
year mentioned in his records seems to be 17, correspond- 
ing to A D 1319 . He had the surname Kodandaraman, 
and the com with the legend Kodandaraman on one side 
and the double fish on the other most probably belongs 
to him 3 * * * This king, unlike Vira Pandya, did not 
evidently long survive the defeats at the hands of 
Ravivarman Kulasekhara and Muppidi Nayaka

CHAPTER XV 


ADMINISTRATION AND SOCIAL LIFE UNDER 
T.HE PANDYAS OF THE SECOND EMPIRE 

BEFORE we take up the history of the later Pandyas, 
tracing the story of the decline of the Pandyan power, 
some attention may be given to the study of the adminis- 
tration and social life of the country under the Pand}as 
in the age of the Second Empire, in so far as this can be 
done with the aid of contemporary records 

Besides the existence of written records, the careful 
maintenance m the capital of registers showing the rights 
m the land of individuals and corporations and of the state 
all over the country is very clearly and fully attested by 
- k contempoiary inscriptions Many of these records contain 
^transactions in which lights m land are transferred from 
one party to another , the stone inscriptions and copper- 
plate records appear to have been only copies of originals 
maintained in more perishable material which should have 
disappeared long ago, and this view is strengthened by the 
occurrence of the word Tulyam (equal) at the beginning or 
the end of many of these epigraphs The frequent 
referencd^to dlat found in our records may also lead one 
to the conclusion that the originals of the documents were 
written on palm-leaves 1 There appears to have been a 
legular procedure to be observed in the numerous cases 
m which lands were made over tax-free to temples or 
* Brahmins by the state . 2 In such cases the firststep was

to prefer a request to the king at some suitable hour and 
get his oral sanction to the proposal. This was usually 
done by a high official of the state The king’s sanction 
was accompanied by an order that the necessary entries 
should be made in the revenue registers and the dim and 
ulvan from the revenue depaitment issued thereon. 
Sometimes, years elapsed from the date of the oial order 
before a single transaction was carried through all, its 
stages and the grant became effective The entries m the 
revenue registers appear to have been intended to effect a 
decrease in the revenues due to government and to record 
a corresponding increase m the income of the donee. 
Such transactions are generally found in triple or some 
times even quadruple records, the main part of the contents 
being repeated thrice or four times, each time with a 
separate purpose The fust is generally a simple lecord 
of the king’s oral sanction — Kelvin or Tirumugam as it is 
sometimes called The exact significance of the dlai 
and the ulvmi is not quite clear The ulai geneially 
begins with the Konennmaikondan title of the king, 
without his proper name, and appears to have been an exe- 
cutive order to the officers on the spot to give effect to the 
king’s order with leference to the lands in question The 
ulvmi on the other hand partakes of the nature of a title- 
deed granted to the donee, and is signed by a number of 
revenue officers ( vmiyila / o'r vai ilkjivnseyvdr) .It seems 
likely that a similar method of maintaining records at the 
capital and communicating copies of the orders to the 
executive officers of the localities concerned was observed 
in other important matters as well We have thus a 
Konennmaikondan record of Maravarman Kulasekhara 
[tuc 1 26S) from Alwar Tirunagarl (No 467 of 1909) which 
confers certain special privileges in the distnbution of the

com) if dry , again, the vadskkadamai was half panam on 
every ma of garden land growing plantain, ginger, turmeric 
or betel We are not in a position to say much regarding 
the kinds of taxes raised besides the dues from land. 
A record of Jatavarman Sundara Pandya of about the 
end of the thirteenth century A D from Tirukkaccur 
(Chingleput), No 300 of 1909 — states that a tatf of six 
panams per annum was levied on each shop-keeper, ,on 
each loom of the kaikkolar and the salty ar^ and on each 
oil-monger. 1 It is interesting to note that a king, Para- 
krama Pandya, whofri it is not yet easy to identify, 
confers on a certain individual in the South Arcot 
district the right of collecting certain taxes as a remune- 
ration for his duties of padikkaval (village watch) The 
collections were ‘ at the rate of one kalam of paddy on 
every ma of wet land and one panam on the same area of 
dry land, i/i6th panam on every areca palm, five panams 
on every ma of land which produced sugar-cane, kolundu, 
ginger, gingelly and plantain, and two panams a year for 
every house ( vasal) n 

When so much is uncertain about the number and 
nature of the taxes levied, any conclusions about their 
incidence and their pressure on the people will not be 
easy to formulate However, some stray facts that can 
be gathered from the inscriptions may be set down here. 
But no general conclusions can be drawn frt^i these 
exceptional instances which throw little light on the nor- 
mal system of administration A record (No 8 of 1913) 
of the famous Pandya emperor JatavarmaQ Sufidara 
Pandya (ctcc A.D 1251) seems to register the curious 
fact that the villagers had to make use of the vWram

Jatavarman Sundara Piindya give 'a continuous account 
of a single cume and the manner in which it was 
dealt with 1 A temple priest, Vamanabhatta by name, 
who was returning home at night from the temple, 
was, for some unknown reason, hacked to death in 
a street bj hired assassins employed by one Sattiya- 
navan .The murderers took refuge in a neighbouring 
place and afterwards escaped from it, when attempts 
were made to capture them ‘ Thereupon, the belong- 
ings of Sattiyanavan m Karuverkuncci consisting 
of lands, houses, gardens and servants both male and 
female, were confiscated and made over, as a gift to the 
temple of Sokka-Narayana ’ Subsequently, the murder of 
Vamanabhatta was avenged and Sattiyanavan was killed, 
we do not hear by whom or under what circumstances , 
then his son made an appeal, less than four months after 
the date of the original murder, to the authorities, the 
Srlvaisnavas and others connected with the temple , he 
* said that he had been ruined by the confiscation of 
his father's property, himself having been no party to the 
murder, and that he would pay Soo gold coins to the temple 
treasury in lieu of the confiscated property His plea was 
accepted and his fathers lands, houses, gardens and 
servants both male and female were restored to him 
subject only to the additional condition that he should 
maintain a service (. sandi ) in the temple We also learn 
that, in tTie interval, the property of another person had 
been coruscated, but afterwards, most of it was restored, 
probably because he was able to establish his innocence 
Some points* come out clearly m this case and these are 
worth Rioting Justice is administered in a rough and 
'ready manner by the local authorities of the village A

criminal who is notoriously guilty of a serious offence, 
m this case the murder of a Brahmin, and escapes punish- 
ment, not only forfeits his property, but becomes more 
or less an outlaw who may be killed with impunity by 
anybody. The property that is forfeited under such 
conditions enriches the temple, and neither the king nor 
the villagers seem to touch it, probably in literal fulfil- 
ment of the injunction of Manu in the matter (ix 243 ) 
When the murderer has paid for his offence with his life, 
the bulk of his property is restored to his heir, double 
punishment for the same offence being avoided, so to 
say. A curious inscription from the Chingleput district 
contains a strange narrative of an orgam?ed attempt at 
brigandage and terrorism on the part of some unlawful 
persons of Uttipakkam and the manner in which the 
offenders were dealt with 1 Five Brahmins whose names 
are recorded, and some Vellalas ‘ gave up the duties 
legitimate to their caste, and following the profession 
of the lower classes, wore weapons, murdered Brahmins, 
cut off (their) ears, insulted the Brahmin ladies, commit- 
ted robbery, destroyed cattle and sold them On a 
former occasion complaints had been made against these 
very men to the ruling authorities and they had been 
beaten and fined, without being actually imprisoned 
But they behaved no better afterwards and the inhabitants 
of the neighbourhood again complained of ^Jieir mis- 
deeds to prince Pottappiyarayar, the ruler of the division,

agree with Mr Krishna Sastri in his view that the payment of the balance 
of the criminals’ property for charities in the temples was made ‘ in order 
that these misguided people may, as a consequence, improve Fn their 
character and become at least in the future, usefnl and loyal subjects ’ The 
king evidently had lost all hopes of them, and the temples appear to have 
been the residuary claimants of' all escheated property that was not taken 
by the state,

who sent a contingent of Malayah soldiers to apprehend 
the criminals , two of the Brahmins in the gang, 
Atkondavilh and Pambanaiyan, were captured and impri- 
soned, but not before some of the soldiers lost their lives 
in the conflict with them, and others were stabbed, shot 
with anows, or deprived of their weapons by the bandits. 
When, 5 ome time later, the two prisoners along with some 
others were being taken to the king’s presence, ‘ the 
three other Brahmin brothers who were still at large and 
who, in the meantime, had collected together a number 
of people, attacked and killed the party which was lead- 
ing the captive brotheis to the king, liberated them and 
escaped. The news of this action of the rebels having 
reached the king, he issued the stringent orders that they 
be captured wherever found and punished according to 
the rules applicable to the lower classes, that their houses 
and other hereditary property be sold to temples and 
other charitable institutions, that the money thus realized 
be credited to the treasury in payment of the fine imposed 
on them and that the balance, if any, be presented 
to the temples as a permanent chanty in the name of 
the criminals ’ We do not know how the offenders 
fared after their outlawry by the king, but we learn that 
the order regarding the sale of their properties was lite- 
rally fulfilled These occurrences belong to the reign of 
a Jatavajpaan Sundara Pandya who was perhaps the 
famous ruler of that name who came to the throne in 
AD 1251 or some later monarch We have an instance 
of gros5 mismanagement on the part of a temple manager 
coupled with misconduct with ‘ a Brahmin widow from a 
^oreigil country ’ , complaints against the manager’s con- 
duct were made by the assembly of Tirupputtur (Ramnad 
district) about 1291 A.D to the ruling king Maravarman 
Kulasekhara , but the king’s judgment is unknown as the

end of the inscription (No. i25o£i9o8) is lost. 1 2 It seems 
to have been the rule that all offences were m the first 
instance dealt with by the village officers and the village 
assembly o£ the locality, and that only when these autho- 
rities proved unequal to the task, any matter was submitted 
to the king’s officers, or, in an extieme case, to the king 
himself. An inscription Irom Pudukkott.ih (No 372 
of 1906) of about the middle of the thn teenth century A D. 

‘ refers to a meeting of the inhabitants of districts, cities 
and villages in Konadu The pTl/Futsoi the temple of 
Tirunalakkunramudaiya-Nayanar had made away with 
the cash as well as the jewels of the temple. One of 
them confessed to having taken a portion of the lost cash 
and shared it with a carpenter. The other plljaus 
denied all knowledge of the lost property, but were 
implicated by the toimer The lying pFqans were 
orderd to be taken to tne court {d/iai masana) where they 
were required to handle a (red-hot) ploughshare. The 
hands of all of them were burnt, and then they confessed 
their guilt They were all ordered to be dealt with as 
sinners against the god Siva {invadiuluns) ’ 2 The 
references in this record to the dharwaiana — perhaps the 
king’s court — and the ordeal of the ploughshare must be 
noted. Another record furnishes an instance of the re- 
cognition of the right of private warfare among local 
chieftains so long as it did not interfere with Uw peace- 
ful villagers in the neighbourhood (No. 359 of 1914) 

A few civil disputes with the manner of their settle- 
ment are also recorded In one case ( No. 571 0^1920) 
there was a dispute among Bhattars connected with 
a temple near Kattumannarkoyil in South Arcot ‘as to f

who had the right to perform the piija in the temple, 
and the matter was arbitrated by the assembly with 
the aid of proofs produced by either party to the dispute, 
and it is interesting to note that one side pleaded 
prescription as having enjoyed the right ‘ from the time 
of Kuldttunga Choiadeva II who covered (the temple) with 
gold, Rajarajadeva II, Perumal Tnbhuvana Vlradeva, 
Rajnrajadcva III, Avani-alappirandan-Kopperunjinga- 
deva, Perumal Sundara Pandyadeva, Perumal Kulasekha- 
radeva, Vlra Pandyadeva and even up to the eleventh year 
of the ruling king, Perumal bundara Pandyadeva, as a 
matter of couise ’ 1 The succession of kings who ruled 
in the locality appears to be very correctly mentioned here 
and that fixes the time of the record somewhere late in the 
thirteenth or early in the fourteenth century A D About 
the same penod ora little later (more exactly, Saka 1298, 
A 1) 1376 ), we hear of a long-standing dispute in twenty- 
four villages in the region of the modern Ramnad 
district between the caste people and the pariahs in 
the villages, resulting at one stage in some loss of life on 
both sides , this dispute seems to have been settled 
ultimately in an amicable manner by the intercession of 
a certain (jangai)arayan, evidently a ro}al official. The 


1 ARJO, 1921, p irt li, para 40 The epigrapbist adds ' it is interesting 
in thi^'Conncction to note that, in the assembly that met to decide this 
question sat, among others, pilgrims from many districts and people from 
different parts of the kingdom It is not known whether these outsiders had 
any \oiec in the deliberations of the assembly Howeter, the fact remains 
that'tbe assembly was not a packed body and that public opinion was invited 
as a healthy factor in the deliberations of the assembly I am inclined to 
thtqh that nothing more is meant in the record than that the proceedings of 
the assembly were public, even as trials take place in open court today, 
but I do not hu%e the test of the inscription It is, however, extremely 
unlikely that the assembly had a fluctuating constitution, or that they were 
directly influenced in their judgment by the • public opinion ’ of the pilgrims

understanding that both sides accepted was ‘ that the 
panahs should beat the drum (murasa) for the caste 
people on all occasions, good and bad, and receive in 
return a padakku of paddy and a fowl. Every resident 
of the parru who was entitled to the privilege should 
measure out in the harvest season, irrespective of the 
yield, a kalam and a turn of paddy (to the pariahs', for 
this service.’ 1 It may be noted, by the way, that in the 
time of a Sundara Pandya we have an instance of a lady, 
by name Peiungarunaiyatti alias Devargalammai, wno 
was counted among the nyuyaltar (committee of justice ?) 
m the well-known village of Uttaranmerur (probably 
modern Uttiramallur near Kanchlpuram) 2 , and that ‘ a 
record of Maravarman Kulasekhara ( acc A.D 126S) from 
Kiladi in the Madura district (No. 449 of 1906) refers to 
the nirvakasabhai (executive committee) of the village ’ 3 
The part played by the temple in the general life 
of every village is very largely attested by our epigraphs 
We have seen enough to realize that the most fruitful 
sources of our knowledge of the history of the country 
are stone inscriptions preserved in temples and copper- 
plate grants. Of these the stone records in temples are 
more numerous and varied in their interest In addition 
to throwing light on matters like land-tenure, revenue 
administration and the administration of law and justice, 
these records enable us to • reconstruct with Vl some 
confidence the part of the temple in the general social 
economy of the time It is clear that in the mfddle 
ages in South India the temple was much mqre thkn 
a place of common worship. ‘ Temple worship is not so

important for the Hindus as church services for the 
Christian The) set more store on home ceremonies 
and on contemplation h 1 And yet, every village had its 
temple, and every temple was the object of universal 
attention at the hands of the princes and the people 
of the land The temple is historically more important 
as a social and economic entity than as a religions 
institution , the history of Hinduism, even in South 
*India, is much more than the history of her temples. 
But the story of the social life of the country, of her 
common people, centres round the temple in a manner, 
that is perhaps equalled only in mediaeval Europe, 
although with this vital difference, that in South India 
the villagers held the temple, while m Europe the church 
or the monastery held the village 

The temple was the centre of universal culture 
The best architecture and sculpture and such painting 
as there was, were lavished on it Fine arts like music, 
dancing and jewel-making flourished m the temples and 
primal lly on their account Several temples contained 
libraries and were centres of religious and secular 
learning The drama, closely allied to the dance, was 
promoted by some temples Above all, the temple was 
for the village the most powerful economic corporation 
which not only sustained, by means of its lavish endow- 
ments,^ the arts of civilizod existence, but enabled the 
villagers to turn to it in times of need for economic 
support, if not also for purposes of physical defence 
A few facts, gleaned from a mass of similar data, may 
now be*set down to confirm these statements about the 
teipple and its part in the life of mediaeval South India

(Chmgleput) dated in the tenth year o f Jatavarman 
Sundara Pandya (No. 322 of 1911) states that ‘ the assem- 
bly of the village seeing that it was not possible to main- 
tain the lamps, offerings and festivals m the temple from 
the income available for that purpose, assigned the north 
division {vadakuiu) “with its wetlands, garden lands, 
houses and house-sites” to the temple, but retained 
therein 3,000 kuh of land with houses and house-sites for 
their own use They decided also to pay the dues* 
on them such as pon-van and nattu-vaii from their own 
pockets and agreed that “ if ever, owing to unfortunate 
circumstances, we are induced to sell this land, we shall 
do so, for the price at which it then sells, to the sacred 
treasury of the temple”.’ 1 An inscription from Kama- 
rasavalli (Tnchinopoly) of the tenth year of Jatavarman 
Vira Pandya (No 88 of 1914) gives an idea of the manner 
m which funds were raised by the inhabitants of the vala- 
lisdn for effecting certain repairs to the temple They 
agreed to pay to the temple a small cess on all merchan- 
dise sold by them, e g one-fourth paiiam on each bundle 
of cloths for women, on each podi of pepper, on each 
padi of areca-nuts, one kasu on each podt of paddy, etc 2 
A record from Alagapun (Ramnad) (No 109 of 1924) 
dated m the fifteenth year of Maravarman Kulasekhara-

the temple for the provision of lamps in the temple 
Another record from Mannarkoil m the nineteenth' year

sition by the king’s order ( niyoga ) of private houses for 
a second prakara to the temple being built according, to

in the fifth year of the reign of Jatavarman Kulasekhara

(tr zs'tl-^u.) in the hall called Tirugnanasambandan-

Vajalur (Chingleput) came to an agreement in the

by w hich they released all the lands which belonged to 
four temples which w'ere probabl) all situated in Vaya- 
lur, and relinquished their previous hold on them, 
whether that was b) moitgage or by purchase In 
addition to this, they undertook never again to hold these

of ‘treason against Siva’ and ‘treason against the

inscription from fsermadevi (No 695 of 1916) mentions a 
grant of land to a library ( Sarasvati BkandUra) m a 
temple in the locality, and records containing endow- 
ments for the recitation and study of the Vedas and 
Puranas in temples are frequently met with A 
record (No 557 of 1916) from Pattamadai (near Senna- 
devi, Tinnevelly district) is of more than ordinary 
interest as it registers a grant to a dancing girl fqr 
enacting a drama, not specified, on certain festival days 1 
We see that the temples also furnished numerous 
occasions for disputes on various matters A record in 
the sixteenth year of Maravarman Sundara Pandya 
(No 141 of 1902) states that the authorities of the 
temple of Devanayakapperumal in Tiruvendipuram 
decided to follow the system of worship practised in all 
other temples, and we have no means of knowing the 
nature of the innovation that necessitated this rather 
conservative affirmation regarding the manner of wor- 
ship. A record of the late thirteenth century (No 432 
of 1913) narrates a dispute between the chetties and the 
oil-mongers (vamya-nagarattar) of Aragalur (Salem 
district) with regard to the management of temple festi-

and such other matters 1 About the middle of the 
thirteenth century a rather acrimonious quarrel between 
the f?aivas and the Vaisnavas representing the two 
adjoining temples at Tirumaiyyam in the Pudukkottah 
state is said to have resulted in a cessation of worship 
in both the temples, and to have been finally settled by 
the mediation of a military officer of the Hoysala Vim 
Somesvara, Appanna Dandanayaka by name 2 

The effects of the Muhammadan invasion early in the 
fourteenth century and the part played by Vijayanagar in 
the reaction against Islam are graphically mentioned in a 
temple record (No 64 of 1916) in the thirty-first year of a 
certain Maravarman Vira Pandya which says ‘ The times 
wereTulukkan times, the devadcma lands of the gods were 
taxed with kudunai , the temple worship, however, had 
to be conducted without any reduction , the ulavti or 
cultivation of the temple lands were ( sic ) done by turns 
by the tenants of the village , at this juncture Kampana 
Udaiyarcame (on his southern campaign), destroyed the 
Tulukkan, established orderly government throughout 
the country and appointed many chiefs ( nayakkaiirnfa ) 
foi inspection and supervision in order that the worship 
in all temples might be revived legularly as of old ’ It 
is fuither stated that some of the dancing girls of the 
temple (devaradiyai) died, some became very poor, and 
manjw'ere ready to migrate to other distant places 
For the preservation of the original status of the temple, 
some of its land which was enjoyed as kaniyatchi by 
a certain* Narasinga Devar was now sold to another 
person, the former having died without leaving an heir, 
for the maintenance of ten dancing girls including

Besides temples, there were malhas representing 
different sects of Hinduism which were also recipients 
of several gifts from the king and the people of the 
country, some of which have been incidentally touched 
upon. There is some reason to believe that the clciss of 
Ekadanda wnnyUsms was rather influential m the soutji 
of the Pandya country. Their presence in the Veda- 
vyasamatha in the Bhaktavatsala temple in fsermadevi is 
mentioned in one record (No. 544 of 19 ir), and anothei 
(No 435 of 1906) refers to a similar institution in 
Muiappunadu, near Tmnevelly. 1 2 Buddhism and Jainism 
seem also to have survived to the middle ages , they 
must have carried on an obscure existence , yet there is 
some reason to think that Jainism had .1 little more 
importance than Buddhism In a record (No. 1 13 of 1904) 
from Tiruccopurm (South Arcot) dated in the reign 
of Jaiavarman alias Tnbhuvanacakravartin Sundara 
Pandya, a certain f?ariputtira Pandita figures as a donoi 
and there is a reference to ‘ Sangattai ’ most probably 
members of the Buddhist Sangha A record (No 358

the famous Jatavarman Sundara Pandya [acc AD 1251) 
contains a gift of land as Palhccandam to a certain 
Palli — a Jain temple— whose name is illegible^ An 
inscription from Pudukkottah (No. 367 of 1904 — Amma- 
sattram) of a certain Sundara Pandya mentions one 
Dharmadeva Acarya as the pupil of Kanakacand^apandita. 
Although the second name is in pait a conjectural

CHAPTER XVI 


THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND LATER. 

DECLINE AND END 

J ATAVARMAN VIra PANDYA continued to rule for several 
years after the first Muhammadan invasion of the Pandya 
country and, as has been seen, late records of his reign 
of about A D 1 340 show evidence of the recovery of the 
land from the ravages of the invaders. It is, however, 
difficult to trace m any detail the course of events in 
the Pandyan kingdom m the fourteenth century The 
chronicles relating to the period narrate wild and fanciful 
stories which have sometimes been accepted as history, 
but are by no means reconcilable with the evidence 
furnished by the epigiaphs The general outline of the 
story is clear The establishment of the Muhammadan 
power m Madura about A.D 1330 must have deprived 
the Pandyan rulers, Jatavarman VIra Pandya and his 
co-regents of their hold on their capital The evidence 
from epigraphs, however, shows clearly that even the loss 
of Madura did not mean the immediate disappearance 
of the power of the Pandyas from the districts of Madura, 
Ramnad and Tanjore. Till about the middle^ of the 
century or even a little later, the Pandyan rulers appear 
to have held sway over parts of these districts * 

It is not within the scope of this work to deslribe 
m any detail the story of the Sultanate of Madura 
and the barbarous misdeeds that disgraced the Short 
period of its precarious existence The subjects of the 
Sultans seem never to have reconciled themselves to the 
rule of the Turuskas (Tulukkar) as they were called, and 



242 THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 

Madhuravi'/ayam of Ganga Devi 1 The Madhuravijayant 
is an almost contemporary poem in the conventional epic 
style in Sanskrit dealing with the conquest of the Madura 
Sultanate by Kumara Kampana altos Virakamparaya 
It is a composition of considerable literary merit by the 
wife of Kampana, and even in its present mutilated condi- 
tion, the poem throws much welcome light oh the 
political conditions of the time. We learn from the 
poem that some time after Kampana conquered the 
Sambuvaraya of the Rajagambhirarajya and established 
his rule over Tondaimandalam (Tundlia) with his capital 
at Marakatanagarl (another name for Kanchl?), a mysteri- 
ous lady appeared before Kamparaja and narrated to 
him m detail the wicked deeds of the Yavanas (Muham- 
madans) m the southern country She said ‘ The temples 
in the land have fallen into neglect as worship m them 
has been stopped Within their walls the frightful 
howls of jackals have taken the place of the sweet 
reverberations of the mndanga Like the Turushkas 
who know no limits, the Kaveri has forgotten her ancient 
boundaries and brings frequent destruction with her 
floods. The sweet odour of the sacrificial smoke and 
the chant of the Vedas have deserted the villages 
( agraharas ) which are now filled with the foul smell of 
roasted flesh and the fierce noises of the ruffianly 
Turuskas The suburban gardens of Madura present 
a most painful sight , many of their beautiful cocoanut 
palms have been cut down , and on every side are seen 
rows of stakes from which swing strings of human skulls 
strung together. The Tamraparnl is flowing red with 
the blood of slaughtered cows. The Veda is forgotten

and justice has gone into hiding , there is not left any 
trace of virtue or nobility in the land and despair is writ 
large on the faces of the unfortunate Dravidas.’ At the 
end of her speech, the lady produced a mighty sword, 
the symbol of Pandya sovereignty and spoke again 
‘This sword, O! King!, was wrought of yore by 
Visvakarma from the essences of all the heavenly instru- 
ments of war for the use of Loid Siva in his fight 
against the Asuras He then gave it to the Pandyan 
king who pleased him by his penances, and with its aid 
successive rulers of his dynasty held unrivalled sway 
for a long time And now finding that, by dint of fate, 
the kings of the Pandya line have lost their prowess, (the 
sage) Agastya has despatched this sword to be placed 
iq your strong hands ’ The rest of the speech is an 
exhortation and a prophecy foretelling Kampana’s suc- 
cesses in the south This account in the Madhuramjayam 
is valuable m two respects It gives a fairly reliable 
account from the Hindu point of view of the state of 
feeling m the country towards its Muhammadan rulers, 
and in a matter like this, contemporary literary evidence 
is of inestimable value in supplementing the evidence 
from epigraphs What is equally valuable to the student 
of Pandyan history is the account of the transference of 
the ancient sword from the Pandyan kings to Kampana 
Agastya, the custodian of Tamil culture, is said to have 
made tjie transfer, as the Pandyan line did not any more 
produce kings worth the name The meaning behind 
the poetic Conception is clear The failure of the Pandyan 
km<rs to recover Madura is the histone justification for 
Kampana’s conquest of the Madura country" , moreover, 
in the Pandyan kingdom, the task of the Vijayanagar 
rulers was the continuance of the work of the ancient 
rulers of the land 



244 THE PANDYAN KINGDOM 

Kampana’s conquest of Madura is partly described 
m the final fragments of Madhuravt^ayam and attested 
by inscriptions and chronicles. His conquest of the 
kingdom of Rajagambhira* is mentioned m an inscrip- 
tion of A.D. 1365, and a record in the thirty-first year of 
a certain Maravarman Vira Pandya from the Ramnad 
district (No. 64 of 1916) refers to the southern campaign 
of Kampana Udaiyar, and his destruction of the Tulukkap, 
followed by the establishment of orderly government 
throughout the country and the appointment of many 
chiefs ( NayakkanmUr ) for the inspection and supervision 
of temples. 1 * 3 The date of this record is now generally 
taken to correspond to A.D 1364. Three inscriptions 
at Tiruppullam (Ramnad) are undoubtedly records of 
this Kampana and are dated in A D 1371 and 1374. 3 On 
the other hand, the evidence of the coinage of the Sultans 
of Madura shows that their rule was continued m 
some manner till A.D. 1377-8. 4 It seems a legitimate 
inference to make that, though the back of the Muham- 
madan power in the south had been broken by A.D 1364 
or even a little earlier, the last Sultans maintained a 
feeble struggle against the growing power of Vijayanagar 
till A.D. 1377-1378 5

at p 1607 of Rangachari

3 Dr S K Aiyangar ( op ett , pp 182 ff) places the early campaigns of

and connects them with the break m the coinage of the Sultans in this 
period Rev Heras {op cti , pp 105-6) seems to underestimate the indi- 
cations obtained from the Pandyan records and is inclined to place the

years and therefore he may be taken to have ruled up to 
about AD. 1380. 1 Another ruler who came to power 
about the same time as the one last-mentioned was 
Maravarman Parakrama Pandya (A.D. 1 335 — 5 2 ) whose 
records 2 are found in the districts of Ramnad, Tanjore, 
S Aicot and Chingleput. A Jatavarman Parakrama 
Pandya ( acc A.D 1357) was m the enjoyment of kome 
power in the district of Ramnad and the Pudukkottah 
state for at least twenty-three years. 3 Yet another 
Parakrama is credited with the renovation of the central 
shrine and the mandapas of the temple at Kuttalam, 
near Tenkasi in the Tinnevelly district, about A D 1387 
in the twentieth year of his reign. 4 And it seems quite 
possible that there was a fifth Parakrama Pandya of 
whom nothing more can be stated than that his thirty- 
first regnal year was about Saka 1337 (No. 203 ol 
1895) pointing to some time about A.D. 1384 as the date 
of his accession Lastly, we find evidence of the rule, 
from AD 1395-1396, of a Jatavarman Kulasekhara 5 who 
claims to have rebuilt the temple at Ilanji (a village near 
Tenkasi) and founded a new Brahmin village in his 
fourteenth and sixteenth regnal years respectively The 
inscriptions of the three rulers last mentioned are not 
found outside the Tinnevelly district 

The evidence from epigiaphs thus shows that, some

the connections are not }et as firmly established as one 
would wish We have also evidence of the existence of 
some kings not mentioned in the copper-plates at all. 
Thus a Jatavarman Vikiama Pandya 1 , who ruled from 
A D 1401 to 1422 and whose records are found m 
Kuttalam and m Tirupputtur fRamnad), among other 
places, is not mentioned m the copper-plates at all 
Another king Parakrama alias Srlvallabha 2 came to 
power about the same time and ruled for at least thirty- 
three years till A D 1434. Somewhat later instances are 
those of Maravarman Vira Pandya 3 who ruled from 
A.D 1443 to at least A D. 1497 and whose records are 
found m the Pudukkottah country , and a Maravarman 
Sundara Pandya (AD 1531-1555) found in Kielhorn’s 
list of Pandya kings These instances show that our 
knowledge of the state of the Pandyan pouer under the 
Vijayanagar empire is still very fragmentary. It is 
significant that a few records of these later kings are 
found in Ramnad and Pudukkottah, as this is some 
evidence that, to the last, these kings struggled to 
hold their own in the Madura country It is not 

till about A D 1483 that the Banaraya chieftains 

are found assuming titles like Madhura-puri-maha- 
oiayakan 4 

The genealogy of the later Pandya rulers as it may 
be inferred from the copper-plate grants may now

as perhaps he is, he must be taken to have been in 
possession of Madura for the best part of his reign, as 
the campaign of Narasa cannot be placed much earlier 
than the closing years of Parakrama’ s reign. He is also 
called Kovkaivendan , an indication that the sea-board of 
, Tmnevelly was still in his control. But the greatest 
event of his reign was undoubtedly the building of the 
Visvanatha temple at Tenkasi The erection of this 
fine structure was undertaken by the king after the Loi d 
appeared before him in a dream and asked him to make 
a new habitation for him at Southern Kasi as his 
original abode m the Kasi of the north had become 
dilapidated. The construction took seventeen years and 
the towers {gopurams) were still unfinished at the time 
of the king’s death. The king’s unbounded piety and 
his great love of art are evident ftom a number of verses 
in which he makes a moving appeal to his suc- 
cessors to safeguard and extend the temple he 
raised in his day Arikesan also made a large tank 
called Visvanathappereri and erected mandapas in Siva 
temples in several places. Arikesan Parakrama had two 
brothers Kulasekhara alias Srivallabha who completed 
the construction of the towers in the Tenkasi temple and 
an Ankesvara 1 It is not clear what led to the succes- 
sion passing to the nephews of Arikesan, nor is it 
possible to determine whether these nephews arc identi- 
cal with Abhirama Parakrama and Ahavarama w^th whom 
the regular genealogy begins in the copper-plates

deserved the name Sahitya-sarvabhauma both on account 
of their own literary compositions and by the encourage- 
ment they gave to the poets of the time. They also 
earned the gratitude of their subjects by the excavation 
of tanks, and the construction of temples and other 
foundations of public utility. These kings liked to 
call themselves DevabrUhmana-sthapaiiacarya , and when 
Robert de Nobili wanted that Srivallabha, the brother of 
Ativirarama, should listen to ‘ the new doctrine preached 
by the Western sannyasi\ he was put off on one ground 
or another 1 * The last of these kings, of whom we have 
authentic epi graphical evidence, performed a Vedic 
sacrifice in A.D 1615 and assumed the titles Somayaii 
and Diksitar He seems to have lived up to A D. 165 2. 2 
All these rulers were in subordinate alliance 3 with the 
Nayaks of Madura of the line of Visvanatha Nayaka. 
A few of their inscriptions 4 refer to the emperors 
of Vijayanagar and their birudas as well, they also 
adopted the boar as an additional emblem of their family 
along with the carps and the hook. These are indications 
of their acknowledgment of the suzerainty of Vijayanagar.

the Pallava king as did Arikesan, the first king of the 6 innamanui 
plates This rests on his supposition that Vilveli against whom 
Arikesan ot Velvikkudi fought at Nelveli was 1 perhaps a Chera ’ 
But it should be noted that the campaigns of this kmg against 
the Keraja ruler are mentioned separately in the Velvikkudi , 
grant, and that Nelveli is coupled with {§ankaramangai in the 
S innamanui grant as having been fought against the Pallavas 
Secondly, Mr Sastn says that the battle of isankaramangai is 
not mentioned among the battles fought by No 4 Velvikkudi, 
but his grandson No 6 ‘ is clearly said to have crushed the 
Pallava power ’ Surely, the facts (<r) that Sankaramangai is not 
mentioned in the Vejvikkudi grant at all in relation to either 
No 4 or No 6, and (£) that Nelveli is a common factor between 
No 4 of Vejvikkudi and No I of fainnamanur suggest a conclu- ' 
sion very different from that of Mr Sastn And it is strange 
that he should underrate the mention of Nelveli by name in the 
Velvikkudi giant among the achievements of No 4 and imagine 
that No 6 fought at Sankaramangai because he is said to 
have crushed the Pallava power It will be noticed also that, 
by his scheme, he has to postulate a second fight at Nelveli 
* against the very same or a different Chera king ’ for which 
there is no reason suggested Thirdly, Mr Sastn says ' The 
title Parankusa, given to Arikesan in the Tamil portion of the 
Jamnamanur grant, makes it difficult to connect him with the first 
Arikesan Maravarman (No. 4) of the Velvikkudi plates ’ But 
one may ask, how is it less difficult'to connect him with No«(6)? 
The title Parankusa does not occur m the Velvikkudi grant at all, 
and it may be suggested that the other title ‘ Asamasaflaan ’ 
which No 4 gets in the Vejvikkudi grant makes it, if anything, 
easier to identify Parankusa with him, rather than with his 
grandson. And the chief name of the king Arikesan is common 
to both records and has the same import as the Parankusa title 
Lastly, Mr Sastn says ‘The fact that Parankusa Arikesan’s 
grandson is called Rajasimha m the Sinnamanur plates suggests 
the possibility of Arikesan himself being also called Rajasimha,

which title we actually find for the first time given to Termaran 
(No 6) in the Vejvikkudi plates ’ It is clearly simpler to say 
that the two Rajasimhas of the Sinnaraanur and Vejvikkudi grants 
are identical as well as the two Ankesans Moreover, it is very 
risky to infer the titles of a king from those of his successors as 
is done by Mr Sastri Thus, none of the considerations brought 
forward by Mr Sastri can be accepted as establishing Mr Ven- 
kayya’s system of genealogy, and the reis no reason to modify 
>the conclusions stated by me at p 41 It may be added that on 
the other system, we know nothing of Nos (8) and (9) (of Mr 
Sastn's genealogical table), the so called Rajasimha II and 
Varaguna I respectively, as neither the Velvikkudi nor the 
Sinnamanur plates gi/e an account of their reigns 

Page 42, n 1 — The Sinnamanur grants have since been 
published in SI I, vol in, part iv, Cf Mr Krishna Sastn’s 
observations on the smaller Sinnamanur plates at p 447 He 
thinks that the donor of these plates was Parantaka Nedunjadayan 
’ or an immediate successor of his

Page 49 —Attention may also be drawn to the expressions 
‘ Kali-arasan-vali-talara ’ (1 90) and ' Kalippagai ’ (1 100) m the 
account of Parantaka Nedunjadayan’s reign in the Vejvikkudi 
grant Mr Krishna Sastri interprets these phrases as referring 
to the Kali age, though, elsewhere, he accepts the suggestion 
that the Kajabhras were of the Kalikula (A / , xvn, pp 306 n, 
307o-8)

and the Mahavamsa, the expression hatva of the Kanyakumari
