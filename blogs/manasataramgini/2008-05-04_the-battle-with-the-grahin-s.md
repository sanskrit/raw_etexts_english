title = "The battle with the grAhin-s"

+++
The return to the mantra of skanda suppressed the second grAhin. The
first grAhin appeared to be suppressed but returned with a vengeance to
spread fear. Then out of the blue a chakShurmantrin and a
kaNDUyana-pishAchinI were dispatched. For 10 minutes it the former sent
us into a state of terror but the prayoga of rudra drove it away without
further harm. Then the pishAch\~AnganA gripped us along with the first
grahin which had returned to torment. The dart of viShNu had finally
thrown away the pishAchI.
