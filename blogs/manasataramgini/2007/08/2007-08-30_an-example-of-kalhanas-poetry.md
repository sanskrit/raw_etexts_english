guhon-mukhI nAga-mukhApIta bhuripayA ruchim | gaurI yatra vitastAtvaM
yAtApyayujjhati nochitAm | (rAja-tara\~NgiNI 1.29)  
Even though gaurI has assumed the form of vitastA, she does not leave
her innate inclinations-  
she turns her face towards guha (kumAra) and the elephant-faced one
(nAga-mukha- vinAyaka) drinks her abundant, tasteful milk OR \[she flows
towards the ravine (guhon-mukhi) and distributary streams (nAgamukhA=
snake-mouths) drain her abundant tasteful water.\]

vitastA is identified with gaurI because the river is born in himavat,
just as gaurI.
