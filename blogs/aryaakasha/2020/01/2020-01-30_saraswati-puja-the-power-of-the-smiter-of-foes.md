Yesterday (by now) marked Saraswati Puja ; and as has become my custom,
I present some brief thoughts and enlightenment via way of tribute.
Seems the appropriate thing to do, given the nature of the Devi in
question, and customary associations of Same.

And speaking of just those customary associations – it seems to me that
we often have this mental image of Saraswati as being rather passive; a
beatifically calm figure playing a sitar, smiling beneficently, in
contrast to the much more fearsomely formidable Mother Durga, and the
darkly destructive (yet beautiful – or, perhaps, therefore beautiful)
Mother Kali.

Now this is not to say that these conceptions are inaccurate. After all,
they have attained quite some currency \[not in the Lakshmi sense\] for
good reason. And partially because we have an almost innate
understanding and an appreciation of what it is that a figure with the
iconography in question is intended to represent – a bearer, \*the\*
bearer, of art, culture, wit, wisdom, and the Civilization for which the
other Devi manifestations we are perhaps better acquainted with visually
have taken up arms to protect.

Yet it is a curious thing. If you ask people to identify a Greek
equivalent to Saraswati, most of the time they shall point towards \[and
this is a rather elaborate Dikaiosune reference, also\] Athena. “Goddess
of Wisdom”, and wise enough to bear arms where necessary. And, often, to
wear a helmet – something that we don’t seem to see too much of in
artistic portrayals of various warriors and heroes and suchlike, despite
the debilitating impacts of head-injury ‘gainst which they necessarily
protect.

Now, on the surface of it, this might seem rather odd. Other than both
having an interlinkage with the portfolio-area of ‘Wisdom’, what
coterminity could there be between the Spear-wielding, Shield-bearing,
Gorgon-head-trophy-carrying, Cloak-of-flayed-skin-garbed \[yes, this is
part of what is meant by “Pallas”…\] Patron Goddess-General of Athens ….
and a River-Goddess armed with a musical instrument. Guitar solos can be
epic, and are played out on an “axe”, but short of bashing somebody over
the head with one … or, for that matter, garroting somebody with
piano-wire, with the potential exception of dubstep or certain American
experiments featuring the theme to Barney the Dinosaur, music is but
rarely \*directly\* weaponized.

And yet, art not so.

I have written extensively elsewhere about how Language, Culture, Art,
are in fact some of the \*mightiest\* weapons in any arsenal; and not
least because they are often subtle enough in application to not be
\*noticed\* as the “weapons” that they actually, truly, are. You want to
win a war, then as any number of military and political theorists have
pointed out … there are several ways to eliminate an enemy; one of the
better ones being to make them no longer an enemy, but rather a more
amenable party toward you – perhaps even a friend. Which is in part
doable via what we would today term ‘soft power’ influence. Hence why
Hollywood is such a grand instrument of American hegemony.

And also, I suppose, part of why I am engaged in writing commentaries
such as these – to gather, garner, glean the knowledge, and thence
facilitate its transmission, its uptake, its re-immanentization into our
reality, as ‘weaponized theology’ in service of the Divine Cause.

Yet this is not quite what I am getting at heer.

Rather, that was sparked in part by perusing one of the more famous
Saraswati hymnals of the RigVeda, RV VI 61 – and seeing for my own eyes
just how Powerful – in the sense of Forceful – that She Can Be.

There are various verses which can be cited to illustrate this
observation, for example:

“2 She with her might, like one who digs for lotus-stems, hath burst
with her strong waves the ridges of the hills.  
Let us invite with songs and holy hymns for help Sarasvatī who slayeth
the Paravatas.  
3 Thou castest down, Sarasvatī, those who scorned the Gods, the brood of
every Bṛsaya skilled in magic arts.”

But one of the most interesting, for our purposes, is line 7.

In the Sanskrit, it reads:

उत सया नः सरस्वती घोरा हिरण्यवर्तनिः \|  
वर्त्रघ्नी वष्टि सुष्टुतिम \|\|

Which, per the Griffith translation, is rendered:

“Yea, this divine Sarasvatī, terrible with Her golden path,  
Foe-slayer, claims our eulogy.”

Now, it is that first word of the second half of the line which is the
key here – Vritraghni. Griffith has translated it as “Foe-Slayer”, and
in a sense – as well as following other, Hindu commentators – he is
correct with this. It \*can\* mean “Foe-Slayer”, and more specifically,
it \*does\* mean the slayer of a \*particular\* Foe. That being Vritra.
You may have heard of him – the demon-dragon who disrupts the
water-cycle and imprisons the rivers as hoarded wealth. Not hard to see
why Saraswati would have a bone to pick with him. That bone, because
this is now a slightly involved Puranic reference, belonging to Dadhachi
… but again, I digress.

There are two ways to interpret the word. If it means “Foe-Slayer”, then
the specific colouring and connotation of referring to Her as
Vritra-Slayer \[interestingly, this is also the direct cognate term for
the Zoroastrian theonym of their ‘sanitized’ version of Indra –
Verethragna, ‘Smiter of Resistance’\], is intended to equate Her power
and potential with that of Lord Indra – i.e. \*the\* Vritra-Slayer
\[Vrtraghna being a reasonably attested later Indra theonym, hence the
co-option for Verethragna during the course of the latter’s
(re-)introduction into the Zoroastrian schema post-“Reforms”\]. And that
is no small thing!

Yet there is a second interpretation, often less emphasized in favour of
the above, but which I consider to be quite important. Namely, that of
Saraswati \*as\* being rather more literally \[and I mean that, too, in
at least two senses of the term\] Vritra-Slayer.

Which is not, of course, to deny Indra – and/or Brihaspati – His (and/or
Their) Due. But rather to imply that a co-operation of sorts has taken
place.

That the Slaying of Vritra has taken place with Saraswati as the active
instrument, the Weapon.

Now we can subtly infer this via making use of any of the several
RigVedic Hymnals within which Lord Brihaspati uses \*prayer\* to kill
Vritra and/or Vala. Technically, it is often Prayer summoning/conjuring
an Orbital Bombardment via Meteor \[‘Call Down The Thunder’, and ‘Death
From Above’, we might say\]; as the Prayer in question is an expression
of Vak – Divine Speech. And what is Saraswati? Purification, per some
etymologies, Purifying Speech \[‘सरस्’ has a double meaning of ‘Speech’,
but also ‘Fluid’, ‘Stream’ – which makes quite some conceptual sense
once one thinks about it, and also helps to explain the continual
‘Seven’ metaphor as applies the conduits from Earth to the Heavens …
Seven Sages Who Speak and Sing, Seven Tongues of Flame, Seven Rivers,
Seven Voices/Metres, … you get the idea.\]

Purification carried out through the judicious use of Divine Force.
Rendering something Holy … by putting holes in it. Applying the
Hallowing Blessings of Lord Agni … via the fire-power (phwer, indeed, in
PIE terms for the full doublet!) of the Flamethrower. Or, I suppose,
given the context and the content, “Water-Blasting”.

Yet there is also a rather more direct attestation. Indeed, it is the
major substance and the subject of RV 8 89 – a hymnal dedicated to Vak
Devi, and depicting Vak acting in availment of Indra in His Mighty
Deeds, indeed being quite directly responsible for the empowerment and
the ultimate cause of the Victory of the Righteous.

“1. I MOVE before thee here present in person, and all the Deities
follow behind me.  
When, Indra, thou securest me my portion, with me thou shalt perform
heroic actions.  
2 The food of meath in foremost place I give thee, thy Soma shall be
pressed, thy share appointed.  
Thou on my right shalt be my friend and comrade: then shall we two smite
dead full many a foeman.  
3 Striving for strength bring forth a laud to Indra, a truthful hymn if
he in truth existeth.  
One and another say, There is no Indra. Who hath beheld him? Whom then
shall we honour?  
4 Here am I, look upon me here, O singer. All that existeth 1 surpass in
greatness.  
The Holy Law’s commandments make me mighty. Rending with strength I rend
the worlds asunder.  
5 When the Law’s lovers mounted and ap. proached me as 1 sate lone upon
the dear sky’s summit.  
Then spake my spirit to the heart within me, My friends have cried unto
me with their children.  
6 All these thy deeds must be declared at Soma-feasts, wrought, Indra,
Bounteous Lord, for him who sheds the juice,  
When thou didst open wealth heaped up by many, brought from far away to
Sarablia, the Ṛṣi’s kin.  
7 Now run ye forth your several ways: he is not here who kept you
back.  
For hath not Indra sunk his bolt deep down in Vṛtra’s vital part?  
8 On-rushing with the speed of thought within the iron fort he
pressed:  
The Falcon went to heaven and brought the Soma to the Thunderer.  
9 Deep in the ocean lies the bolt with waters compassed round about,  
And in continuous onward flow the floods their tribute bring to it.  
10 When, uttering words which no one comprehended, Vāk, Queen of Gods,
the Gladdener, was seated,  
The heaven’s four regions drew forth drink and vigour: now whither hath
her noblest portion vanished?  
11 The Deities generated Vāk the Goddess, and animals of every figure
speak her.  
May she, the Gladdener, yielding food and vigour, the Milch-cow Vāk,
approach us meetly lauded.  
12 Step forth with wider stride, my comrade Viṣṇu; make room, Dyaus, for
the leaping of the lightning.  
Let us slay Vṛtra, let us free the rivers let them flow loosed at the
command of Indra.”

A full exegesis upon the meanings drawn upon in this Hymnal is beyond
the immediate scope of this piece; but suffice to say that it is
absolutely uncoincidental to find the direct linkages of The Waters, The
Ocean, The Floods , to and via the Divine Speech, to the provision of
the Soma, the Bolt-weapon, the power and the velocity and the motion and
force of Speeded Thought.

“Saras”, remember?

Now all of this relates rather well to both who and what Saraswati
\*actually is\*.

You will hear more euhemeric-ally minded persons, often with a vested
interest in pushing the OIT barrow, attempting to reduce Saraswati down
to a mere \[yes, PIE pun\] terrestrial river. And while that isn’t
\*quite\* as egregious as making a Milky Bar out of the Milky Way
\[‘सर’, as it happens, can also mean Milk; ‘सार’, Cream – i.e.
\*Churned\* Milk\], it nevertheless seems a bit peculiar, a bit
reductionist, a bit overtly lacking in grandeur to downplay or even
outright \*ignore\* the reality of the \*Celestial Saraswati\* (“She Who
hath filled the realms of earth, And that wide tract, the firmament!”
\[RV 6 61 11\]), the River of Stars twinkling up there across the
Night’s Sky, to only focus upon a (potential) terrestrial counterpart.

\[And that is leaving aside the rather intriguing question of just
\*which\* terrestrial counterpart … one of the hypothesized
now-long-dried-up river-systems that once existed in North-West India of
‘convenient’ timing in ongoing rear-guard actions against the relentless
march of all the assembled knowledge-spears of other fields? \[How sadly
ironic that a dusty gulch would be feebly fortified against this veer-y
Saraswati-aligned onslaught of newly found and anciently re-pieced
together information.\] Or perhaps a similarly named river of
Afghanistan, or what is tantalizingly talked about in Persianate
sources, wherein the Saraswati-equivalent Goddess has a cloak comprised
of the skin of the Eurasian Beaver, found north of the Caucasus, etc.\]

No, that would not even be on a par with insisting that the only Ganges
which matters is the physically observable one flowing out into the Bay
of Bengal.

And I mention the Ganges not only via way of immediate comparison in the
sense that it has long been acknowledged that the physical water-course
coming down below GauMukh and onward, is a \*bearer\* for the
Metaphysical Ganges, the Supernal Ganges, the on-Earth flow of the
\*Celestial Ganges\*, that RIver of Suns’ Course earlier aforementioned
… nor even due to the longstanding awareness of the Milky Way as that
veer-y same Celestial Ganges aforementioned.

But rather, because of how we see the ‘translation point’ between
Celestial Ganges and Terrestrial Ganges to take place within the
appropriate \[Shaivite\] mythic cosmology: Namely, She pours down from
the Upplands beyond this World, beyond this Universe, beyond the Stars
Themselves, with the full-force of the conceptual downpour from Brahman
… to the head, to the hair, to the Mind of Lord Shiva Himself – the only
‘Man’ \[and I do not mean ‘human’, but rather in the PIE resonant sense
wherein it relates to ‘Mind’, this also standing at the root of terms
such as “Mantra”, and as we shall see when I get on with the next
installment of the Mytholinguistics of War series – Manyu, and also
Minerva; The ‘Empowered Mind’, the ‘Focused Mind’, the ‘Sharp Mind’, the
‘Pious Mind’ is indeed the mightiest of weapons!\] able to handle such
Insight, such Inspiration, such Inception … such Knowledge, which is
then radiated outward, amidst His Whirling Hair like darting thoughts,
in a manner akin to both cultural and meteorological diffusion, even as
the main course’s ‘cushioned’ upon landing ‘essence’ makes Her way out
through the Glacier, the Cow’s Mouth \[and you can see from the above
Hymnal of the 8th Mandala how the Cow’s Mouth and Vak are closely
aligned in principia ! \] , and then down out through the Gangetic
Plane, to Varanasi/Benares/Kashi, and the Sea. \[From Ocean to Ocean,
Star to Indian, Respectively, we might, perhaps, say.\]

Now, in terms of how all of this fits into the broader Indo-European
mytho-religious schema … not only do we have a typological model to help
explain the mysteries inherent in ShivLingPuja (wherein, per the concept
of Eternal Return a la Eliade, the pouring of Milk \[‘Saras’,
remember?\] upon the ShivLing, Which then flows over, down, and thence
on out … is in fact a microcosmic model of the macro-cosmos; and the
investiture of inspirational essence therein to, to meet the Stone, the
Mountain, Who Is Already There (A)Waiting\] ; but we have \*also\* just
helped to explain what is going on when Lord Odin sups from the Well of
Mimir, the Mimisbrunr, via which He is granted knowledge, wisdom,
insight further to His already considerably capacious means; and, for
that matter, likely also what is going on with the pouring of the white,
hallowing libation at the Well of Urdr, Urdarbrunnr, upon the local root
of Yggdrasil, the Axis Mundi \[akin to the ShivLing in multiple senses,
in this term\].

At the Spring of Urdr are also found Swans, and it should by now come as
absolutely no surprise to us to hear that the Swan – correlated also
with Purity, Discernment, and Wisdom \[and, for that matter, with the
derivation of the Soma; which, in terms of the Vak and Verse and Metre
connectivity, well, Poetry from Pressing-Stones’ Libation – Meath,
Mushroom-derived or otherwise, and Madhu-sweetened in augmentation of
the substance of the verses’ lustre\] … the Swan is \*also\* the Vahana
of Saraswati.

Now there is more, \*much\* more, that can and should and must be said
upon \*all\* of this \[including how the eighth line of R 6 61 relates
to the enrapturing concept of Vacam Garjit Lakshanam – “Whose limitless
unbroken flood, swift-moving with a rapid rush, / Comes onward with
tempestuous roar.” – of which I have often written in the past in the
course of my Language, Vak, and Devi commentaries, articles, and
insights\]; but I think that I have made my point over, and again, and
then some; especially with comparative mythographic and Indo-Europeanism
for the Modern Age / Mytho-Political facings.

When we think of Saraswati, we often picture that placidly
Sitar-strumming figure. And yet, “still waters run deep”, with furiously
powerful currents hiding under pleasantly calm surface-exteriors.

If we see Saraswati bearing Culture in the form of music, or literature,
or other such things, it is good. Yet not only are these, too, weapons
\[‘Kulturkampf’ is a concept, for a reason\]; but Saraswati \*also\*
bears martial potency which, as we have seen, is at least the equal of
Lord Indra. And, in fact, it is not only that She comes Roaring Across
The Sky \*Bearing\* Weapons – but also, that She is The Weapon, Herself!

The Calm Culture-Bringer, in other words, is but one facet of an
entrancingly \*Deep-a\* Goddess. But you don’t have to just take ‘my’
Word for it:

RV VII 95:

“THIS stream Sarasvatī with fostering current comes forth, our sure
defence, our fort of iron.  
As on a car, the flood flows on, surpassing in majesty and might all
other waters.”

And, because it really is a rather excellent Hymnal, the entirety of RV
VI 61 \[Griffith Translation\]:

“1. To Vadhryasva when. be worshipped her with gifts she gave fierce
Divodāsa, canceller of debts.  
Consumer of the churlish niggard, one and all, thine, O Sarasvatī, are
these effectual boons.  
2 She with her might, like one who digs for lotus-stems, hath burst with
her strong waves the ridges of the hills.  
Let us invite with songs and holy hymns for help Sarasvatī who slayeth
the Paravatas.  
3 Thou castest down, Sarasvatī, those who scorned the Gods, the brood of
every Bṛsaya skilled in magic arts.  
Thou hast discovered rivers for the tribes of men, and, rich in wealth!
made poison flow away from them.  
4 May the divine Sarasvatī, rich in her wealth, protect us well,  
Furthering all our thoughts with might  
5 Whoso, divine Sarasvatī, invokes thee where the prize is set,  
Like Indra when he smites the foe.  
6 Aid us, divine Sarasvad, thou who art strong in wealth and power  
Like Pūṣan, give us opulence.  
7 Yea, this divine Sarasvatī, terrible with her golden path,  
Foe-slayer, claims our eulogy.  
8 Whose limitless unbroken flood, swift-moving with a rapid rush,  
Comes onward with tempestuous roar.  
9 She hath spread us beyond all foes, beyond her Sisters, Holy One,  
As Sūrya spreadeth out the days.  
10 Yea, she most dear amid dear stream, Seven-sistered, graciously
inclined,  
Sarasvatī hath earned our praise.  
11 Guard us from hate Sarasvatī, she who hath filled the realms of
earth,  
And that wide tract, the firmament!  
12 Seven-sistered, sprung from threefold source, the Five Tribes’
prosperer, she must be  
Invoked in every deed of might.  
13 Marked out by majesty among the Mighty Ones, in glory swifter than
the other rapid Streams,  
Created vast for victory like a chariot, Sarasvatī must be extolled by
every sage.  
14 Guide us, Sarasvatī, to glorious treasure: refuse us not thy milk,
nor spurn us from thee.  
Gladly accept our friendship and obedience: let us not go from thee to
distant countries.”

To quote from MahishasurMardini Stotram:

“तव चरणं शरणं करवाणि नतामरवाणि निवासि शिवम्”
