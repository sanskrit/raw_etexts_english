We tested out a few maneuvers directly in enemy territory and we found
things held pretty well. We also spied a long but interesting attack
route that would carry us straight to the ground of the initial
encounter. We realized that this attack route would save us a lot on
investing in the baggage train. While there is one outstanding issue, we
were fairly satisfied with it and will investigate it further. We also
tested out some other attack routes and have a reasonable picture of how
the battle may go. We still are bothered by our main weakness, but there
is not much we can do about it.
