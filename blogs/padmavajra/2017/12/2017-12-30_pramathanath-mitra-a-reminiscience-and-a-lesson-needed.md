So I decided to translate the article linked here,a [reminiscence on a
founder of the Anushilan
Samiti](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213362278124748&set=a.2758188727213.130215.1632611047&type=3)
for a
friend\[[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20171230165401/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213362278124748&set=a.2758188727213.130215.1632611047&type=3)),and
I am now putting this translation(paraphrased a bit here and there)
here.

Sri Pramathnath Mitra,one of the supreme founding members of the
Anushilan Samiti was an upAsaka of shakti and concerned himself with
\[physical\] strength as well rigorously. He was one of the strongest
men amongst Hindu Bengali society of that time. His sole aim was a
martial(sAmarika sikShAya sikShita) cadre/race of Bengalis(jAti),and
that is why the Anushilan Samiti and the Jugantar(the two fearsome
militaristic revolutionary organizations set up and run by Bengali
Hindus),from the very moment of its founding(prathama lagna thekei),were
clothed with militarism and shakti-bodliy(daihik),mentally(mAnasik),and
in character(chAriktrik). Before founding the Anushilan Samiti,in the
daily The Bengali(which was edited by Surendranath Banerjee),he wrote an
essay on the martial art of lathi khela,and spoke about the need to
cultivate a fighting spirit amongst the youth of Bengal.He was a
follower of Bankim,and he said this:

> “The lathi is the national weapon of Bengal. A Bengalee lathial,
> properly trained, can with his single lathi keep a dozen of swordsmen
> at bay.
>
> It is a healthy outdoor exercise. As an art of offence and defence it
> combines in itself the skill required, in the bayonet exercise and the
> sword exercise. It gives full play to the exercise of muscles. It
> necessitates the cultivation of the quickness of the eye and quickness
> of the movement of every limb, which is a very favourable growth of
> the resourcefulness, activity of the body, strength of muscle and
> sinew and keenness of the observation and above all, it inspires
> confidence in its possessor. It is a purely national art and
> inexpensive. We should be unwise if we allow it to die away from our
> midst”.

Even if it was a hundred years ago,what he said still remains a firm
truth,and the aim of the Anushilan Samiti is yet unfulfilled\[my
personal note:Was actually subverted\].The Bengali Hindus in 1947 were
broken like the Jews,but yet they could not rise up like an Israel
anewbecause they did not follow the path of their very strong/powerful
predecessors due to their weakness,and didn’t even attempt to,and
instead has gone being like a beggar(bhikhiri),at the expense of
others.A beggar has no respect,and he is enjoyable by
everyone(ie,everyone makes fun of him/pities him).

Bengali Hindu society has now become like a whore,who will sell off all
that is dear to her(j\~nAna,buddhi,vidyA,etc) for money(ie,the highest
bidder). But she has to live. So,then,what to do?(here I’ve been
literal-ish,but I am not able to convey the sense adequately).

If Bengali Hindu society is to survive,it must transform from an
amiable-tempered society(sushIl samAj) to a martial society(sAmarik
samAj).Let them suffer as many belts or firing squads by the
mlecchas,who cares?Discipline and the fear factor should be instilled
firmly into the Bengali mind…so…back to basics.
