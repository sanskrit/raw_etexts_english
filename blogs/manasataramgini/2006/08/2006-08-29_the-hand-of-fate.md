title = "The hand of fate"

+++
After much struggle our forces fought their way to a strong position on
the front of the dvayaM daNDakAH. We were close to taking this much
desired and important outpost after a really long drawn conflict. But,
just then the news reached us on the khANDavan front that something we
always suspected from the fateful day of Nov 30, 2004 was true. It put
us in an even more complicated mess on that front. What struck us in
hindsight was that how despite knowing everything fairly accurately
before hand we kept committing mistake after mistake in our actions. We
could today clearly see what the Hindus call the hand of fate dragging
us into the morass, despite us having seen the bog from a over a mile
away. It taught us that foresight and rational decisiveness does
necessarily translate into the right path if the flow of fate is against
it.
