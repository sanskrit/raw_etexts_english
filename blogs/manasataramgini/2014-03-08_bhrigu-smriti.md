We provide below a translation of the proto-scientific section of

Translation of the [bhR^igu
smR^iti 1-4](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/bhrigu_smriti_hs-1.pdf)

We are not entirely happy with this translation done sometime back:
Despite trying to be as literal as possible it is difficult to achieve
that exactness for a text like this one. Yet it might be good enough for
those interested in the comparative history of early philosophy and
science in India and Greece
