Over the weekend, I somehow wound up called upon to explain how
Indo-European eschatology and metempsychosis works … to an associate’s
11 year old niece. Who wanted a reasonably comprehensive explication. I
still massively simplified things, of course, because there was also an
implicit time-limit … but as it may be of more general usage/interest
here it is in slightly edited format for you.

Begins:

“Ihave been that-a-way;there is a Judgement, sure , I have …
encountered the Judges ,as i am sure i have told you

Now, the Vedic metempsychosis etc. – it basically has at least two
paths:

One of which does the reincarnatory thing people know about ; The other
winds up heading to the Realm of the Forefathers

But yes, dying gloriously in battle is also in there – in the
Hindusphere I mean. In fact, it’s something not often known about -but
it’s definitely in the legal texts.  
And oddly enough – the actual religion in India and Nepal … ordinary
people have a belief in the Heaven , afterlife etc. It’s the Brahminical
side of things and the rather arcane and abstract reasoning where
reincarnation is more exclusively focused upon.

\[At this point I got asked for a shorter version, so as to be more
easily relayed\]

So, the Indo-European position is thus:

The Sky Father has Kids  
Some of these kids are twins.  
One is Manu (Romulus) , the other is Yama (Remus / Iemus)  
Manu (Mannus in Germanic) is the FIrst Man – hence why we are Mankind,
the Kindred of Mannus  
Sons of Mannus  
Sons of the Sun, indeed

Now, Manu is to reign , and his descendants likewise, in this world

But Yama … Yama realizes that as humans are mortal, this is going to
cause a bit of a problem when the humans die  
So Yama kills himself – sacrifices himself  
And heads off beyond the Veil of Death \[‘Kaal’ – from PIE ‘Kel’ ; also
c.f Hades \[‘The Unseen’\] in Greek\]  
In order to find / found the City/Realm of the Dead

\[this is where Lemuria / Remuria comes from, as it happens .. City of
Remus – like Rome is of Romulus\]  
  
\[and hence Lemures as Shades of the Dead – like our Pitrs come back
during Pitru Paksha\]

Yama travels out along that previously untrodden path , in order to give
us this security that when we die , if we are worthy , we won’t have to
go wandering dispossessed as ghosts  
But rather, have a place in the cosmos

And this also sets up the reciprocal contract – whereby we try and look
after our ancestors, by making offerings , libations , and keeping Their
memories alive – so that there are things to eat up there for them : and
when they come and visit us during the Fortnight of the Forefathers
\[Pitru Paksha\]

Now, not everybody goes that way. Some people choose to come back
reincarnated ;  
other people aren’t quite good enough to get ‘retired’ from the cycle
and earn the high heaven – so they get sent back down, too

The idea is that you reincarnate until you are good enough to not do so

The Greeks have this concept, oddly enough – around basically, if you
make it to the ‘good’ afterlife three times in a row, you get promoted.

Alongside this, of course, there are the more ‘focused’ afterlives for
devotees with purpose –so, for instance, Valhalla & Folkvangr …  
and of course, we have places, spaces, understandings similar to this in
Hinduisms  
the Court of the Deity , becoming part of His Household  
and becoming part of the Retinue of Rudra – the Ganas, for instance

Of course, some people … well, the reincarnatory cycle doesn’t quite
happen right away  
There’s stuff that they’ve done wrong, that hasa become wrong with them
– that must be .. ironed out : or beaten out , if you prefer  
  
\[and there is in fact a Sanskrit way to say ‘Contrapasso” .. like i
knew there had to be one, and i found one quite by chance awhile back –
exactly the same understanding ! Exactly where i said it should be !\]

So there are Hells, too  
And this is partially why Lord Yama is DharmaRaja – because looks after
the Righteousness angle of things – and that means straightening out the
wrongdoers likewise as well as rewarding the just  
anything else ?

\[At this point, quoth my associate: “She asks about the ‘three g\[o\]od
lives’ thing. What do you get promoted to? (I’m live reading this to
her) \[in fact\] I’ll pass her my phone, cos I have to get \[ready\]”\]

“lol, all-g ; I’ll try and keep it reasonably PG whilst also being
theologically authentic.

\[Associate: “She says she wants the complex version.”\]

Well I did link you the Yama hymnal \[note: RV X 14\]

But yeah uh, in the Greek version , the three times means you get
admittance to the Isles of the Blessed

\[Associate/Associate’s Niece: “Also what happens when you go to hell”\]

Well, as I had mentioned above – it is a case of ‘contrapasso’ ..
counter-pressing – “let the punishment fit the crime”

So whatever it is that you’re there for, you get subjected to stuff
designed to … rehabilitate you , we might say – and rehabilitation here
may be quite painful.

So say you do not carry out your responsibilities of the sacred
hospitality – being a good host , and making sure your guests ,
including the Gods \[as guests\] are fed and such …

And this isn’t an accidental thing, this is because you are miserly and
mean-spirited

Well, a certain period of suffering in the Hells, wherein you are
subjected to being forced to just stand there with food and water in
sight but just out of reach … it encourages the empathy , it shows why
these things are to be done … because now you get some visceral personal
experience hat is now etched into your soul of why what you did (or
didn’t do) was wrong”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now obviously, I’ve *massively* oversimplified … quite a few things –
particularly pertaining to the Hindu understanding of things, and the
geography (indeed, the cosmology) of the After-Worlds.

But sometimes, it is useful to just have the basics. And these can be
expanded upon later.

For more information about … just about all of these things, please
consult my previous works. Including the *actual* Indo-European Guide
Book of the Dead series that I keep meaning to get back to ; as well as
various cosmological works, the SONS OF THE SUN series, and scattered
references to the Solar Afterlife, the Veil of Death, the Lord of the
Glorious/Ancestral Dead, and the Wealth of this most august figure.
