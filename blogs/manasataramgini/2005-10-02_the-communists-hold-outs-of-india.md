title = "The communists hold outs ofxa0India"

Recently there was a report that the Russians after having buried
Stalinâ€™s mummified corpse were going to do the same to Lenin. The
Indian commie leaders thundered that it was a desecration of their hero
and also the Russian heritage itself. This aspect of the commie hold out
in India is reminiscent of the holding out of the sister Abrahmism in
India. Christianity is declining in its heartland- Europe (though it
still persists as a sub-current ideology) but is vigorously pursued in
India. Indians once fooled seem to follow the delusion much after the
original fools are cured. One wonders why?
