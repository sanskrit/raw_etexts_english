title = "The tilottamA prayoga"

+++
The bhUta tantras recommend the worship of apasaras and provide the
outlines for these rites. However, their proper deployment remains
unknown except to one who has mastered the true rahasyas. The mantras of
the practioners of the chInAchAra are nowhere in the league of these
rahasya mantras. 8 principal apsaras may be invoked with apasara maNDala
though tillotamA may be offered a special sacrifice for the highest
purpose. The apasaras who are invoked are:  
shashidevI, tillotamA, kA\~nchanamAlA, kuNDalahAriNi, ratnamAlA, rambhA,
urvashI and bhUshiNI.

The great tillotamA prayoga goes thus:  
The mula mantra is:  
[](ci\(21011,'vicinvat2B01m'\))oM shrI tilottamA| vicinvatIm AkirantIm
apsarAM sAdhudevinIm |  
glahe kR^itAÃÅni gR^ihNAnAm apsarAM tAm iha huve || hUM svAhA

He then lays down 5 five feathers with the formula:  
[](ci\(16915,'paF100caco0D1E0101'\))pa\~nchachoDA upa dadhAti | apsarasa
evainam etA bhUtA amUShmil loka upa shere | Atho tanUpAnIr evaitA
yajamAnasya | yaM dviShyAt tam upadadhad dhyAyet | etAbhya evainaM
devatAbhya A vR^ishchati | tAjag Artim ArChati ||

With that he excludes his bhrAtR^ivyas from success. He then grinds a
paste of 16 indra yava grains, 30 chaNaka (chickpeas) and mixes it with
taila and prepares a vashikaraNa lepa with that. Then he offers 5
oblations in the fire with a mixture of salt, tila, ghee, honey and
milk.
