title = "The magic of the deva-ogdoad"

+++
Classical Hindu tradition holds that the ogdoad of deva-s corresponding
to their directions is:  
Indra: East; Agni: Southeast; Yama: South; Nirṛti: Southwest; Varuṇa:
West; Vāyu: Northwest; Kubera: North; Īśāna: Northeast.  
The central position might be occupied in certain traditions by
Prajāpati, Viṣṇu, Savitṛ or the Puruṣa-Prakṛti continuum from which the
gods differentiated.

Now, a famous verse, quoted by the great scientist-mathematician
Bhāskara in his Līlāvatī, says:

indro vāyur yamaś caiva nairṛto madhyamas tathā |  
īśānaś ca kuberaś ca agnir varuṇa eva ca ||

Now using the positions of the gods as in the classical ogdoad we get
the below matrix:

![M=\\begin{bmatrix} vAyu & kubera & ishAna\\\\ varuNa & madhyama &
indra\\\\ nirR^iti & yama & agni\\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%3D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+vAyu+%26+kubera+%26+ishAna%5C%5C+varuNa+%26+madhyama+%26+indra%5C%5C+nirR%5Eiti+%26+yama+%26+agni%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M=\\begin{bmatrix} vAyu & kubera & ishAna\\\\ varuNa & madhyama & indra\\\\ nirR^iti & yama & agni\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}")

We then plug values for each of the elements of the matrix based on the
positions of the gods in the above verse. Indra= 1; Vāyu= 2; Yama= 3;
Nirṛti= 4; madhyama, the middle or mean= 5; Īśāna=6; Kubera= 7; Agni= 8;
Varuṇa= 9  
When we do so we get the famed magic square (sarvatobhadra) of Hindu
tradition known as the ubhaya-pañcādaśaka

![M=\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 7 & 6\\\\ 9 & 5 & 1\\\\ 4 & 3 & 8\\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%3D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+2+%26+7+%26+6%5C%5C+9+%26+5+%26+1%5C%5C+4+%26+3+%26+8%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M=\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 7 & 6\\\\ 9 & 5 & 1\\\\ 4 & 3 & 8\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}")

This magic square is found widely in Hindu tradition. It is one of the
magic squares that is worshiped by the physician while deploying
bheṣaja-s pertaining to child-birth along with a mantra to Agni, Vāyu,
Sūrya and Indra. There it is specified using partial bhūtasaṃkhya
notation as:

vasu-guṇābdhy-eka-bāṇa-nava-ṣaṭ-sapta-yugaiḥ kramāt |  
yantraṃ tu pañcadaśakaṃ likhyate nava-koṣṭhake ||

8, 3, 4; 1, 5, 9; 6, 7, 2 in order are to be written in the 9 cells for
the yantra with sum of 15.

It is also recorded in śaiva traditions as a yantra. Indeed tradition
holds that the mathematics of magic squares (bhadragaṇita) was taught by
the god Rudra to the yakṣarāṭ Kubera or his ectype Maṇibhadra (e.g. see
Narāyaṇa paṇḍita’s chapter on bhadragaṇita).

There is literally much mathematical magic in the bhadra square:  
1\) If you add the rows, columns and diagonals you get 15, which is what
gives it name. Thus the magic constant
![\\sum(M)=15](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum%28M%29%3D15&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sum(M)=15")

2\) If you reflect the square about any of the sides or transpose the
matrix i.e. make rows into columns then the resultant square is also
magic.

3\) It contains the first 9 positive integers and is a ![3 \\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"3 \\times 3") magic square; hence, its order
![n=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=3") and its elements are
![1:n^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%3An%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1:n^2"). For such a magic square (known as a normal or fundamental
magic square) the
![\\sum(M)=\\frac{n^3+n}{2}=\\frac{27+3}{2}=15](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum%28M%29%3D%5Cfrac%7Bn%5E3%2Bn%7D%7B2%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B27%2B3%7D%7B2%7D%3D15&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sum(M)=\\frac{n^3+n}{2}=\\frac{27+3}{2}=15")

4\) If you put any sequence of consecutive positive integers serially in
the same positions as the occurrence of 1:9 in the square then you get
another magic square. Thus you can generate infinite magic squares.
Tradition holds that the ancient astronomer Garga described this
additive derivation of a sequence of magic squares. He states that sun
is represented by the above deva square; by adding 1 successively the
sequence of squares associated with other planetary bodies. Adding 19 to
each element generates the Kaubera-sarvatobhadra:

![M\_k=\\begin{bmatrix} 21 & 26 & 25 \\\\ 28 & 24 & 20 \\\\ 23 & 22 & 27
\\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_k%3D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+21+%26+26+%26+25+%5C%5C+28+%26+24+%26+20+%5C%5C+23+%26+22+%26+27+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_k=\\begin{bmatrix} 21 & 26 & 25 \\\\ 28 & 24 & 20 \\\\ 23 & 22 & 27 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}")

Its magic constant is
![\\sum(M\_k)=72](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum%28M_k%29%3D72&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sum(M_k)=72")

5\) For the deva (fundamental) magic square and all magic squares
sharing the general form with it (see below for general form) the
arithmetic mean of the elements of the matrix equals the central element
or the madhyama as it is termed in Hindu tradition:
![\\mu(M)=M\[2,2\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu%28M%29%3DM%5B2%2C2%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\mu(M)=M[2,2]"). It is both central positionally and in the sense of
being the mean. Further, for the deva square and all its derivatives
obtained as above ![\\sum(M)=\\mu(M)\\times
n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum%28M%29%3D%5Cmu%28M%29%5Ctimes+n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sum(M)=\\mu(M)\\times n"), where
![n=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=3") the order of the matrix. Thus for the deva square it is
![3\\times
5=15](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Ctimes+5%3D15&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"3\\times 5=15") and for the Kaubera square it is ![3\\times
24=72](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Ctimes+24%3D72&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"3\\times 24=72")

More generally we have the siddhānta attributed to Narāyaṇa paṇḍita
which generates these magic squares using the madhyama
(![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a"))
and 2 other numbers
![b,c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%2Cc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b,c") thus:

![M\_g=\\begin{bmatrix} a+c & a-b-c & a+b \\\\ a+b-c & a & a-b+c \\\\
a-b & a+b+c & a-c \\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_g%3D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+a%2Bc+%26+a-b-c+%26+a%2Bb+%5C%5C+a%2Bb-c+%26+a+%26+a-b%2Bc+%5C%5C+a-b+%26+a%2Bb%2Bc+%26+a-c+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_g=\\begin{bmatrix} a+c & a-b-c & a+b \\\\ a+b-c & a & a-b+c \\\\ a-b & a+b+c & a-c \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}")

Thus we get the magic constant as ![\\sum(M)=3 \\times
a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum%28M%29%3D3+%5Ctimes+a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sum(M)=3 \\times a"). We get the deva square by plugging ![a = 5, b =
1, c =
-3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%3D+5%2C+b+%3D+1%2C+c+%3D+-3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a = 5, b = 1, c = -3"). This general form of the square can be used to
prove other results as those presented below pertaining to such squares.
By plugging ![a=10, b=-2,
c=6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D10%2C+b%3D-2%2C+c%3D6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=10, b=-2, c=6") we get the ubhayatriṃśaka seen in śaiva and medical
works:

![M\_{ut}=\\begin{bmatrix} 16 & 6 & 8\\\\ 2 & 10 & 18\\\\ 12 & 14 &
4\\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_%7But%7D%3D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+16+%26+6+%26+8%5C%5C+2+%26+10+%26+18%5C%5C+12+%26+14+%26+4%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_{ut}=\\begin{bmatrix} 16 & 6 & 8\\\\ 2 & 10 & 18\\\\ 12 & 14 & 4\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}")

Its magic constant is
![\\sum(M\_{ut})=30](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum%28M_%7But%7D%29%3D30&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sum(M_{ut})=30") the idealized number of days in the lunar month and
its dot-product constant (see below) is 364 which is 1 short of the
idealized number of days in the year.

6\) Whereas the off-diagonals or the wrapped diagonals do not add up to
![\\sum(M)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum%28M%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sum(M)") their sums
![\\sum(M\_{od})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum%28M_%7Bod%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sum(M_{od})") do show a regular relationship: ![\\sum(M\_{od})=n
\\times
Cr(M)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum%28M_%7Bod%7D%29%3Dn+%5Ctimes+Cr%28M%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sum(M_{od})=n \\times Cr(M)") where ![Cr(M)\\Rightarrow M\[1,1\],
M\[1,3\], M\[3,1\],
M\[3,3\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Cr%28M%29%5CRightarrow+M%5B1%2C1%5D%2C+M%5B1%2C3%5D%2C+M%5B3%2C1%5D%2C+M%5B3%2C3%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Cr(M)\\Rightarrow M[1,1], M[1,3], M[3,1], M[3,3]") i.e. the corner
elements. Thus for the four off-diagonals of the deva-square we have:

![2+1+3=3 \\times 2=6\\\\ 4+1+7=3 \\times 4=12\\\\ 6+9+3=3 \\times
6=18\\\\ 8+9+7=3 \\times
8=24](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%2B1%2B3%3D3+%5Ctimes+2%3D6%5C%5C+4%2B1%2B7%3D3+%5Ctimes+4%3D12%5C%5C+6%2B9%2B3%3D3+%5Ctimes+6%3D18%5C%5C+8%2B9%2B7%3D3+%5Ctimes+8%3D24&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2+1+3=3 \\times 2=6\\\\ 4+1+7=3 \\times 4=12\\\\ 6+9+3=3 \\times 6=18\\\\ 8+9+7=3 \\times 8=24")

One immediately notices that the mean of the sum of these off-diagonals
is:
![\\frac{6+12+18+24}{4}=15](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B6%2B12%2B18%2B24%7D%7B4%7D%3D15&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\frac{6+12+18+24}{4}=15"). This property is a general feature that
holds good for all the magic squares derived from the same general form
as the deva square such as the Kaubera square.

7\) Remarkably if we write out each row, column and diagonals (including
the off-diagonals) as 3 numbers forward and reverse then the following
relationships hold:

![276+951+438=672+159+834=\\\\ 294+753+618=492+357+816=\\\\
258+714+693=852+396+417=\\\\
654+798+213=456+312+897=1665](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=276%2B951%2B438%3D672%2B159%2B834%3D%5C%5C+294%2B753%2B618%3D492%2B357%2B816%3D%5C%5C+258%2B714%2B693%3D852%2B396%2B417%3D%5C%5C+654%2B798%2B213%3D456%2B312%2B897%3D1665&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"276+951+438=672+159+834=\\\\ 294+753+618=492+357+816=\\\\ 258+714+693=852+396+417=\\\\ 654+798+213=456+312+897=1665")

Now if one does the same with any other additively derived magic square
we get the same. But we need to keep in mind the places thus for the
Kaubera square we get:

![212625+282420+232227=252621+202428+272223=\\\\
212823+262422+252027=232821+222426+272025=\\\\
212427+262023+252822=272421+232026+222825=\\\\
252423+262827+212022=232425+272826+222021=727272](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=212625%2B282420%2B232227%3D252621%2B202428%2B272223%3D%5C%5C+212823%2B262422%2B252027%3D232821%2B222426%2B272025%3D%5C%5C+212427%2B262023%2B252822%3D272421%2B232026%2B222825%3D%5C%5C+252423%2B262827%2B212022%3D232425%2B272826%2B222021%3D727272&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"212625+282420+232227=252621+202428+272223=\\\\ 212823+262422+252027=232821+222426+272025=\\\\ 212427+262023+252822=272421+232026+222825=\\\\ 252423+262827+212022=232425+272826+222021=727272")

Thus this summation property is a general one for such magic squares.
Further if we denote this sum as
![S](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "S")
then its ratio to the magic constant
![\\frac{S}{\\sum(M)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7BS%7D%7B%5Csum%28M%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\frac{S}{\\sum(M)}") is a mirror number of the form 111, 10101,
1001001 etc. For the deva square made up of single digit numbers it its
111. For magic squares with double digit numbers it is 10101. For magic
squares with triple digit numbers it is 1001001, so on.

8\) Notably, as above if we write out each row, column and diagonals
(including the off-diagonals) as 3 numbers forward and reverse then the
following relationship holds for their squares:

![276^2+951^2+438^2=672^2+159^2+834^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=276%5E2%2B951%5E2%2B438%5E2%3D672%5E2%2B159%5E2%2B834%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"276^2+951^2+438^2=672^2+159^2+834^2")  
![294^2+753^2+618^2=492^2+357^2+816^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=294%5E2%2B753%5E2%2B618%5E2%3D492%5E2%2B357%5E2%2B816%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"294^2+753^2+618^2=492^2+357^2+816^2")  
![258^2+714^2+693^2=852^2+396^2+417^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=258%5E2%2B714%5E2%2B693%5E2%3D852%5E2%2B396%5E2%2B417%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"258^2+714^2+693^2=852^2+396^2+417^2")  
![654^2+798^2+213^2=456^2+312^2+897^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=654%5E2%2B798%5E2%2B213%5E2%3D456%5E2%2B312%5E2%2B897%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"654^2+798^2+213^2=456^2+312^2+897^2")

This is also generally true for generalizations of the deva square.

9\) The dot product rules: Let ![R\_j,
C\_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_j%2C+C_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"R_j, C_j") be the rows and columns of such magic squares. For our 3rd
order squares they define three element vectors. The dot product of
these vectors would be a scalar e.g.: ![R\_1 \\cdot
R\_2=M\_{11}M\_{21}+M\_{12}M\_{22}+M\_{13}M\_{23}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_1+%5Ccdot+R_2%3DM_%7B11%7DM_%7B21%7D%2BM_%7B12%7DM_%7B22%7D%2BM_%7B13%7DM_%7B23%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"R_1 \\cdot R_2=M_{11}M_{21}+M_{12}M_{22}+M_{13}M_{23}"). Then for the
deva-square and its generalization we have:  
![R\_j\\cdot
C\_j=K](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_j%5Ccdot+C_j%3DK&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"R_j\\cdot C_j=K"); where
![K](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "K") is
the dot product constant of the magic square.  
![R\_1 \\cdot R\_2= R\_2 \\cdot
R\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R_1+%5Ccdot+R_2%3D+R_2+%5Ccdot+R_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"R_1 \\cdot R_2= R_2 \\cdot R_3") and ![C\_1 \\cdot C\_2=C\_2 \\cdot
C\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_1+%5Ccdot+C_2%3DC_2+%5Ccdot+C_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"C_1 \\cdot C_2=C_2 \\cdot C_3")

10\) We can create a square matrix
![D](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "D") by
the process of cyclic difference of rows or columns: ![D\_R=\[R\_1-R\_2,
R\_2-R\_3,
R\_3-R\_1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_R%3D%5BR_1-R_2%2C+R_2-R_3%2C+R_3-R_1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"D_R=[R_1-R_2, R_2-R_3, R_3-R_1]") or ![D\_C=\[C\_1-C\_2, C\_2-C\_3,
C\_3-C\_1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C%3D%5BC_1-C_2%2C+C_2-C_3%2C+C_3-C_1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"D_C=[C_1-C_2, C_2-C_3, C_3-C_1]"). ![D\_R,
D\_C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_R%2C+D_C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"D_R, D_C") are zero-sum semi-magic squares in that the rows and columns
add up to zero but the diagonals do not. This applies for the deva
square and its generalization. Thus for the deva square we have:

![D\_R=\\begin{bmatrix} -7 & 2 & 5\\\\ 5 & 2 & -7\\\\ 2 & -4 & 2\\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_R%3D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+-7+%26+2+%26+5%5C%5C+5+%26+2+%26+-7%5C%5C+2+%26+-4+%26+2%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"D_R=\\begin{bmatrix} -7 & 2 & 5\\\\ 5 & 2 & -7\\\\ 2 & -4 & 2\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}")

11\) For the deva square and its additive derivatives we can define the
eigenvalues
![\\lambda](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\lambda") thus:  
![(M-\\lambda
I)\\overrightarrow{v}=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28M-%5Clambda+I%29%5Coverrightarrow%7Bv%7D%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(M-\\lambda I)\\overrightarrow{v}=0"); where
![\\overrightarrow{v}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverrightarrow%7Bv%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overrightarrow{v}") is the eigenvector and I is the identity
matrix:  
![M\_k=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\
\\end{bmatrix}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_k%3D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+0+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+1+%26+0+%5C%5C+0+%26+0+%26+1+%5C%5C+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"M_k=\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}")

Then for the deva-square
![\\lambda](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\lambda") is obtained by solving the cubic equation:  
![|M-\\lambda I|=
(\\lambda-15)(\\lambda^2-24)=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CM-%5Clambda+I%7C%3D+%28%5Clambda-15%29%28%5Clambda%5E2-24%29%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"|M-\\lambda I|= (\\lambda-15)(\\lambda^2-24)=0")  
Strikingly, the eigenvalues are
![15,-2\\sqrt{6},2\\sqrt{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=15%2C-2%5Csqrt%7B6%7D%2C2%5Csqrt%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"15,-2\\sqrt{6},2\\sqrt{6}"). Thus, the largest eigenvalue square is its
magic constant. More generally for all additive derivatives of the deva
square the eigenvalues are: ![\\lambda=
\\sum(M),-2\\sqrt{6},2\\sqrt{6}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda%3D+%5Csum%28M%29%2C-2%5Csqrt%7B6%7D%2C2%5Csqrt%7B6%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

Notably for all additive derivatives of the deva squares the
eigenvectors take the above forms though the signs of the values might
be reversed.

12\) For such 3rd order magic squares each row, column, diagonal and
off-diagonal can be seen as a triple of numbers that can specify a point
in space as its x, y and z coordinates. We have a total of 3 rows + 3
columns + 2 diagonals + 4 off-diagonals= 12 triples. By permuting the
order in which each number in the triple is taken we can specify 6
points from each triple. Thus we have a total of ![6 \\times 12 =
72](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6+%5Ctimes+12+%3D+72&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"6 \\times 12 = 72") points. Of these
![x+y+z=\\sum(M)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2By%2Bz%3D%5Csum%28M%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x+y+z=\\sum(M)") for those points derived from the columns, rows and
diagonals. Thus, 48 out of the 72 points lie on the plane
![x+y+z=\\sum(M)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2By%2Bz%3D%5Csum%28M%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x+y+z=\\sum(M)"). While those from the off-diagonals lie on 4 different
parallel planes on either side of the main plane. From their equations
we know  
that these planes have a vector of the form ![\\langle 1,1,1
\\rangle](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+1%2C1%2C1+%5Crangle&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\langle 1,1,1 \\rangle") and will make with the horizontal plane (
![z=0; \\langle 0,0,1

Thus, these points define a regular hexagonal bipyramidal frustum, with
the 48 points magic constant points on the principal plane forming a
nice pattern of 4 concentric hexagons.

Figure 1: the principal plane with 48 points from the deva square

The 12 points from two of the off-diagonals form 2 hexagons congruent to
the inner-most hexagon on either side of the principal plane and lie
farthest from it. The remaining 12 points from the other two
off-diagonals form 2 hexagons on either side of the principal plane and
are congruent to the last but 1 of the concentric hexagons counting from
inside.

2: The hexagonal bipyramidal frustum of the deva square

For the deva square the four concentric hexagons have side-lengths of
![\\sqrt{2}, 2\\sqrt{2}, 3\\sqrt{2},
4\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%2C+2%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%2C+3%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%2C+4%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{2}, 2\\sqrt{2}, 3\\sqrt{2}, 4\\sqrt{2}"), with the first and the
last being also the sides of the hexagons forming the base and the
height of bipyramidal frustum. The pyramidal edge of the frustum is
![3\\sqrt{5}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5Csqrt%7B5%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"3\\sqrt{5}") and the remaining off diagonal hexagons cut the pyramidal
side into segments in the proportion
![1:2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%3A2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1:2"). It may be considered the maṇḍala of the deva-s.

13\) Such magic squares can also be converted to the Hindu magic
triangles using Narāyaṇa paṇḍita’s simple algorithm. Below is
illustrated the 4-fold magic triangle, the pañcaviṃśati-yoni derived
from the deva square.

While magic squares might seem to the deracinated modern as a quaint
superstition of the Hindu and some other old civilizations like the
Chinese and Japanese, they might have some deeper significance. For
example there is the deceptively simple looking but yet unsolved
mystery: does a order 3 magic square exist where all the elements are
perfect squares, i.e. are they squares on sides of a right triangle with
integer sides? Here we have looked only at what the Hindus termed
nava-koṣṭhaka-viṣaṃagarbha-bhadra-s. But the several other magic
figurate numbers described in Hindu tradition might have other
interesting mathematics lurking in them. Notably, the great Srinivasa
Ramanujan also (re)discovered several saṃagarbha-bhadra-s similar to
traditional Hindu versions (like the ones found on Candrātreya temples,
including one demolished by the Moslem tyrant Baboor at Gwalior) with
interesting properties. Additional also gives the above formula for the
general nava-koṣṭhaka-viṣaṃagarbha-bhadra-s

More generally they might be seen as a numerical representative of a
conservation law and the structures that emerge naturally once such a
law is laid down. One can also use it as an analogical aid for
understanding structures emerging under constraints. One could conceive
an imaginary model for a protein where the amino acids (standing for
numbers in the square) are under interaction constraints with others to
attain some total constant stabilizing energy. Under such a scenario the
magic square plane as derived above would represent a
![\\beta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\beta")-sheet.
