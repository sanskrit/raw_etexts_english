The Asuras had three citadels; the lowest was of iron, then there was
one of silver, then one of gold. The gods could not overcome them; so
they sought to destroy them by siege; therefore they say–both those who
know thus and those who do not–‘By siege they conquer great citadels.’
They made ready an arrow, with Agni forming the point, Soma forming the
blades, and Visnu as the wings. They said, ‘Who shall shoot it?’
‘Rudra’, they said, ‘Rudra is a fierce (archer), let him shoot it.’
He said, ‘Let me choose a wish; let me be overlord of animals.’
Therefore is Rudra overlord of animals. Rudra shot the missile; it cleft
the three citadels and extirpated the Asuras away from these worlds.
