## CL

*To Sister Christine*

RIDGELY MANOR,

*4th November 1899*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

The letter was all right in reaching. It was only my nervousness. I am
sure you will understand and excuse this. I eagerly expect t o see you
in Cambridge. I am going to New York next week. Thence I go for a few
days to Washington and then to Cambridge. Do come. And mind you, I must
learn German. I am determined to be a French and German scholar. French,
I think, I can manage with the help of a dictionary. If I can do that
much German in a month, I will be so glad.

It naturally takes time for a letter to reach from here. We have one
delivery and one posting a day.

With all love,

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.

My eternal love and blessings to Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\].
