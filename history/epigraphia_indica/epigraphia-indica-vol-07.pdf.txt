Although I am unable to give with confidence the actual equivalent of this date, I may state that between A.D. 900 and 985 the only years for which the date would be quite regular are A.D.919 and 946. 
For A.D. 019 the date would correspond to Saturday, the 24th July, which was the 30th day of the month of Karkataka, and on which the 9th tithi of the dark half of the month Gråvaņa) ended 4 h. 41 m., and the nakshatra was Rõhiņi for 17 h. 44 m., after mean sunrise. 
And for A.D. 946 it would correspond to Saturday, the 25th July, which was the last day of the month of Karkataka, and on which the 9th tithi of the dark half (of the month Áråyaņa) ended 13 h. 11 m. after mean sunrise, and the nakshatra was Rôhiņi the whole day.

A date of the fourth year of the king's reign will be expected to fall in A.D. 1079 or 107 , and this date actually corresponds to Thursday, the 7th November A.D. 1073. This was t1.* 12th or 13th day of the month of Vřiśchika, and on it the 6th tithi of the bright half of tur mouth Märgašira) commenced 1 h. 38 m. after mean suprise, while the nakshatra was Sravana, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 23 h. 38 m. after mean sunrise, and by t*** Brahma-siddhảata the whole day. 
CVIKRAMA-CHOLA. For reasons suggested partly by the new dates of this king, I must recapitulate here the data furnished by the dates already treated of, and the results derived from them. 
No. 10 (above, Vol. IV. p. 73).--- In the fifth year . .. on the three-hundred-anci fortieth day, which was (the day of the nakshatra) Hasta, a Sunday, and the seventh tithi of the first fortnight of the month of Mithuna." Taking this date to have been correctly recordeul! I found the best equivalent for it between A.D. 1110 and 1125 to be Sunday, the 22nd Juno A.D. 1113; and counting backwards from this day, I obtained the 18th July A.D. 1108 as tho day of the commencement of the king's reign. 
No. 21 (ibid. p. 263).." In the 4th year ... on the day of Satabhiabaj, whiclı corresponded to a Monday and to the eighth tithi of the second fortnight of the month of Rishabha," Guided by the result obtained under No. 10, I found this date to correspond to Monday, the 20th May A.D. 1112, when, to omit other particulars, the nakshatra, by the equal space system only, was Satabhishaj for 0 h. 39 m, after mean sunrise. 
No. 22 (ibid. p. 264).—“In the 5th year ... on the day of Årdre, which corra sponded to a Monday and to the eleventh tithi of the second fortnight of the month of Sirler.** Guided again by the result obtained under No. 10, I found that this date would correspond to Monday, the 19th August A.D. 1112; but there was the diffionlty that on this day the nakshatra was Punarvast, not Ardra. 
No. 41 (above, Vol. VI. p. 279).-"In the ... sixteenth year ... in the month of Vaisakha, in the second fortnight, at the time known as Monday combined with an Uttara (nakshatra)." Again guided by the result obtained under No. 10, I found that Monday, the 5th May A.D. 1124, would be an unobjectionable equivalent of this date. 
No, 42 (ibid. p. 280).-"In the 9th year . . . in the Playa year which was the sake year 1049, on the occasion of an eclipse of the moon in the month of Jyaishtha." This data for Saka-Sariyat 1049 expired (which was Plavanga, not Plava) was found to correspond to the 27th May A.D. 1127, but the result obtained under No. 10 led me to assume that the 9th year of the soign had been quoted erroneously instead of the 19th ragnal year. 
From this it will be seen that the results obtained under Nos. 21, 22 and 41, as well as the correction suggested with regard to the regral year of No. 42, mainly depend on the correcta ness of the data furnished by the text of No. 10, which it did not ooonr to me to gepeot. Setting aside the date No. 10, it may be asked, however, how the three dates No8, 21, 22 and 41

? I omit here the date No. 48, whieh will be reconsidered below:

would work out, if the date No. 42 were really, as it is stated to be, a date of the 9th year of Vikrama-Ohola's reign. Sapposing this to be the case, the king's reigo would have commenced some time between approximately the 28th May A.D. 1118 and the 27th May A.D. 1119, and with such a commencement of the reign the dates Nos. 21, 22 and 41 would yield the following equivaleuts :-- 
No. 21, of the 4th year, would correspond to Monday, the 1st MAY A.D. 1122. This was the 7th day of the month of Vộishabha, and on it the 8th tithi of the dark half (of the month. Vaisakha) ended 13 h. 28 m., while the nakshatra was Satabhishaj, by the equal space system and according to Garga from 0 h. 39 m., and by the Brahma-siddhanta from 1 h. 19 m., after mean sunrise. 
No. 22, of the 5th year, would correspond to Monday, the 31st July A.D. 1122. This was the 4th day of the north of Simha, and on it the 11th tithi of the dark half of the month Sravana) ended 4 h. 24 m., while the nakshatra was Ardra, by the equal space system for 12 h. 29 m., and according to Garga for Oh. 39 m., after mean sunrise. 
No. 41, of the 16th year, would correspond to Monday, the 16th April A.D. 1234, when the 6th tithi of the dark half of Vaisakha ended 13 h. 11 m., and the nakshatra was Uttarashadhå, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 23 h.38 m., and by the Brahma-siddhanta for 17 h. 4. n., after mean sunrise. 
It is quite clear then, that, sopposing the king's reign to have commenced between approximately the 28th May A.D. 1118 and the 27th May A.D. 1119, the three dates Nos. 21, 22 and 41 would work out in the best possible.mapner- better, in fact, than with the 18th July A.D. 1108 as the commencement of his reign, because on the equivalent here found for the date No. 22 the nakshatra really was Ârdrâ, whereas on the equivalent previously given for the same date the nakshatra was found to be Punaryasu (instead of the nakshatra Årdrå, quoted by the original date), 
To the date No. 10 I shall have to revert below. For the present it will be suficient to state that, irrespectively of No. 10, the four dates Nos. 21, 22, 41 and 42 for the commenoement of the reign appear to yield some day between approximately the 28th May and the 31st July A.D. 1118. The new dates of Vikrama-Obôla may be expected to shew whether his reigo really commenced at the time here given or on the 18th July A.D. 1108,

If the king's reign commenced on the 18th July A.D. 1108, this date would correspond to Thursday, the 19th Jupe A.D. 1119, which was the 26th day of the month of Mithuna, and on which the 5th tithi of the bright half of the month Åshåạba) commenced 5 h. 15 m., and the nakshatra was Maghe, by the equal space system only, for 7 h. 53 m., after mean sunrise. 
On the other hand, if the reign commenced between the 28th May and the 31st July A.D. 1118, the date must correspond to Thursday, the 31st May A.D. 1123, which was the 6th day 
i No. 164 of the Government Epigraphist's collection for 1894. Another date, which occura in line 3 of the same inscription, was published above, Vol. IV, p. 73, No. 10,

Tlieoretically both the equivalents found might be taken to satisfy the requirements of 
of the case, but there can be no doubt that the second, Thursday, the 31st May A.D. 1123, woul preferable because the tithi of the date ended on that day. This date therefore also would

* In the 11th year (of the reign) of the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Vikrama-Chôļa dēva, on the day of Punarvasu, which corresponded to a Saturday and to the thirteenth titiri of the first fortnight of the month of Makara." 
If the king's reign commenced on the 18th July A.D. 1108, this date yould correspond to Friday, the 27th December A.D. 1118, which was the 3rd day of the month of Makara, and on which the 13th tithi of the bright half of the month Pausha) ended 16 h. 30 m. after mean sunrise, and the rukshatras were Mrigasirsha and Ârdrå. 
On the other hand, if the king's reign commenced between the 28th May and the 31st July A.D. 1118, the date will correspond to Saturday, the 5th January A.D. 1129, which was the 13th day of the month of Makara, and on which the 13th tithi of the bright half (of the month Pausha) ended 5 h. 49 m. after mean sunrise, and the nakshatra was Punarvasu, by the Brahma-siddliânta and according to Garga the whole day, and by the equal space system from 
k. 12 m. after mean sunrise. 
As this date then would be entirely incorrect if the king's reign had commenced in A.D. 1108, and is in every way correct on the assumption that the reign commenced in A.D. 1118, I take it to prove that the latter was really the case. And in my opinion the six dates Nos, 21, 22, 41, 42, 57 and 58, for which in entire agreement with the original data--absolutely faultless equivalents have now been given, shew beyond a doubt that the reign of. Vikrama. Chola must have commenced between approximately the 1st June and the 31st July A.D. 1118.

With the result now obtained, the equivalent previously given for the date No. 10 cannot. of course, be the proper equivalent of that date. A comparison of the dates No. 10 and No. 57. which are both from the same inscription, at once suggests to us that No. 10 is only three days later than No. 57. Both dates are of the first fortnight of the month of Mithnag of the 5th ves of the king's reign; the week-day of No. 57 is Thursday, and that of No. 10 Sunday; and the nakshatra of No. 57 is Maghê (10), while that of No. 10 is Hasta (18). If then the equivalent of No. 57 is Thursday, the 31st May A.D. 1129, the equivalent of No. 10 can only be Sunday the 3rd June A.D. 1123. This day was the 9th day of the month of Mithuna, and on it the nakshatra was Hasta, by the Brahma-siddhanta for 22 h. 59 m., and by the eqgal space system and according to Garga from 1 h. 58 m., after mean sunrise; but the tithi which ended on the same day, 10 h. 12 m. after mean sunrise, was the 8th, not the 7th tithi, of the bright have

The result now arrived at receives an Daexpected confirmation from a reconsideration of :: e date No. 43 (above, Vol. VI. p. 281). This date is of the seventeenth Fear (given in words' ai the king's reign, and of the Sake year 1054 (given in figures only), and gives us fır calculating 
Thursday, the third tithi of the bright helf of Vaisakha. When prerionsly examining it, I found that for Saka-San vat 1054 current it would correspond to Thursday, the 2nd Arzil A.D. 1131 ; and as I found it to be incorrect for what I then had to consider the 17th rear of the ling'reign, I felt no hesitation in accepting Thursday, the 2nd April A.D. 1131, as the true equivalent of the date, and in assuming that the regnal year had been quoted erroneously. 
But now, with the 29th Jane A.D. 1118 as the date of the king's accessiou, a datu iu trie month Vaibakha of his seventeentla year will be expected to fall in A.D. 1135, and for this year the date regularly corresponds to Thursday, the 18th April A.D. 1235, when the third ti of the bright half of Vaisakhe ended 9 h. 30 m. after mean sunrise. I now therefore assdrae tua: the data is really of the 17th year of Vikrama-Chola's reiga, and that the Saka year 1054 has been erroneously quoted instead of 1057 (expired).

The wording of this date is intrinsically wrong, because during the month of Makara the moon can never be anywhere near the nakshatra Pushya on the first tethi of the first fortnight. The probability is that the first fortnight has been erroneously quoted instead of the second, and for the second fortnight the date is correcta 
A date of the month of Makara of the 14th year of the king's reign will be expected to fall in December A.D. 1191 or in January A.D. 1192, and in my opinion this date actually corresponds to Thursday, the 2nd January A.D. 1102, which was the 8th day of the month of Makara, and on which the first tithi of the dark half (of the month Pausha) ended 10 h. 12 m., and the nakshatra was Pushya, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 3 h. 56 m., and by the Brahma-aiddhanta for 1 h. 58 m., after mean sunrise.

“In the 7th year of the reign) of the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Vira-Pandyadêva, on the day of Asvini, which corresponded to a Sunday and to the seventh tithi of the second fortnight of the month of Karkataka." 
If the equivalent found for the date No. 31, which is of the 15th year of the king's reign, is the true equivalent of that date, this date No. 32, which is of the 7th year of the same reign, will in the first instance be expected to fall in A.D. 1259. The date actually corresponds to Sunday, the 13th July A.D. 1259, which was the 17th day of the month of Karkataka, and on which the 7th tithi of the dark half (of the month Ashâdha) ended 11 h. 3 m., and the nakshatra was Asyini for 19 h. 3 m., after mean gunrise. 
The two dates Nos. 31 and 32 together shew that the reign of Vire-Pandya commenced between (approximately) the 11th November A.D. 1252 and the 13th July A.D. 1253.

For Saka-Sańvat 1262 expired this date regularly corresponds to Wednesday, the 1st November A.D. 1340, which was the 5th day of the month of Vfischika, and on which the 12th tithi of the bright half (of the month.

If this date were one of the 8th year of the king's reign, it ought, in accordance with the result obtained under No. 33, to fall in Saka-Samvat 1263 or 1264 expired; but for either of these years it would be incorrect. The date, in my opinion, is really one of the 18th (not the 8th)

The two dates Nos. 33 and 34 would show that the reign of Måravarman Parâkrama Pandya commenced between (approximately) the 1st December A.D. 1334 and the 1st November A.D. 1335.

For Saka-Sampat 1293 expired this date regularly corresponds to Friday, the 8th January A.D. 1372, which was the 14th day of the month of Makara, and on which the third tithi of the bright half of the month Mågħa) ended 19 h. 59 m., and the nakshatra was Satabhishaj, by the equal space system for 20 h. 21 m,, According to Garga for ll h, 50 m., and by the Brahma-siddhậnta for 9 h. 12 m., after mean sunrise. 
Being of the 10th opposite to the 5th, t.e. of the 15th year of the king's reign, the date would shew that the reign of Jatê varman Parákrama-Pandya commenced between (approxi. mately) the 10th January A.D. 1857 and the 9th January A.D. 1358.

Judging by the preceding date, this date would be expected to fall in about A.D. 1154; in mny opinion, it corresponds to the 19th July A.D. 1453. In A.D. 1453 the Karkaga-samkrånti took place 19 h. 36 m. after mean sunrise of the 28th June. The 21st day of the month of Karkataka therefore was the 19th July; and on this day the 14th tithi of the bright half of the month Srâvaņa) euded 14 h. 14 m., and the nakshatra was Uttarâshadha, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 18 h. 24 m., and by the Brahma-siddhinta for 11 h. 50 m., after mean sunrise. But the day found was a Thursday, not a Monday. Since in the whole of the 15th century A..D. there is not a single year for which the date, as recorded by the writer, would be correct, I take Thursday, the 19th July A.D. 1453, to be its proper equivalent, and have no doubt that the writer has quoted the week-day incorrectly.

The three dates Nos. 36-38 shew that the reion of Jatilay&rman Parakrama- Panlyn 
A liten of commenced between (approximately) the 25th March and the 19th July A.D. 1844 tbe month of Mithuna of the 8th year opposite to the 31st year, 1.8. of the 38th yeli', of the same reign should therefore fall in either A D. 1460 or 1461. Now assuming this date: Nr. 19 to be really one of the 39th regnal year, its proper equivalent could only be Wednosday, the 17th June 4.D, 1461. On this day the 10th tithi of the bright half (of the month Ashad ha) Omel 17 11. 51 m., and the nakshatra was Svati, by the equal space system for 19 h. 42 m., by the Brahma siddhinta for 3 h. 17m., and according to Garga for 7., 13 m., after mean sunrise. But 114 1741 Jane A.D. 1461 was the 21st (not the 23rd) day of the month of Mithunay and fell in Saka Sariyat 1383 (not 1381) expired. 
No better result would be obtained if we were to assume the writer to have quoted the Saka year correctly and the regnal year incorrectly. Saka-Samyat 1381 expired would yield nu satisfactory result at all. For Saka-Samvat 1381 current the date might be said to corrend to Wednesday, the 21st June A.D. 1458, on which day the 10th tithi of the bright half (w the month Âahadha) ended 15 h. 35 m., and the nakshatra was Svati, by the equal space system for 10 h. 30 m., after mean sunrise. But the 21st June A.D. 1458 was the 24th (not the 28rd) dny of the month of Mithuna' (and would fall in the 36th or 37th, not the 39th year of tho king'u rri!). 
The date therefore is certainly incorrect; but I have hardly any doubt that its incorreu 14" *** in caused by the writer'a interchanging the last figures of the numbers of the Saka yoar aut offlip Holer day (i.6. by his giving us erroneously 1381 instead of 1383, and 23 instead of 21), and that the day intended is Wednesday, the 17th Juno A.D. 1481. And accepting this ruhull erriert, it would follow that the king's reign commenced between (approximately) the 18th Juno und the lath July A.D. 1423.

The groups tth and ddh are written thth and dudh ; compare, in addition to the cases cited above, tadh-dháma (1. 4) and samiidhdhé (l. 49). 
The inscription is one of king Krishnaraya of Vijayanagara. The greater portion of it consists of verses already known to us from other records." New are only the yerses 7, 9, 10 and 12. Verse 7 states that “from him (i.e. kiog Narasa) was born by Nagamamba king Krishnardyn, who causes pleasure to the world, as the moon, who causes the fragrancy of the water-lilies, was born from the milk-ocean." Křishnaraya's mother is generally called Nå galâ. However, the variant Nagậmbikå is found also in the prose portion of the Hampe and Sankalậpara inscriptions? 
Of grealer interest is verse 9, which praises Krishộariya as him" who, having taken by a forcible attack Sivanasamudre, Udayadri, Vinikonda and Bellakonda, and having captured alive on the battle-field Virabhadra, the son of the Gajapati king, took Kondaviņu.” This account, although rather meagre, is of considerable importance as being the first epigraphical record of Krishnariya's warlike exploits up to the conquest of Kondavidu. The enumeration of the events seems to follow the chronological order. The taking of Sivanasamudra, at any rate, appears to bave been the first military success in Krishqaraya's career. The ancient city of Sivanasamudra is situated on an island between the two great falls of the Kaveri, 9 miles north-east of the modern Kollégal in the Coimbatore district. It belonged at that time to the Ummatúr chiefs, who regarded Somèsvarasvâmin, whose magnificent temple may still be seen at Sivanasamudra, as their family god, The Ummatûr chiefs were subject to the kings of Vijayapagara. The then lord of Ummatür must have revolted against his sovereign ; for, quite in accordance with the inscription, a native chronicle relates that, after having first settled the Drávida country about Conjeeveram, Krishnaraya crushed a refractory Raja in the Maisûr country, the Gaöga Raja of Ummatur. In the war against the latter Krishparåya captured the strong fort of Sivanasamudra and the city of Srirangapattana, after which all Maisûr submitted to him. We can even determine, with great probability, the cause which led to this war, by combining the facts ascertained hitherto with the statements of a Portuguese author. In his Commentaries of the Great Afonso Dalboquergues the son of the great conqueror gives us an abstract of a letter written by a certain Luiz, a Franciscan friar, who, after the disaster at Caliout in January 1510, was sent by Albuquerque to the court of Vijayanagara with the view of securing Krishnariya's assistance against the Zamorin. The letter was delivered by the

recapture ofle * that the king of for an expedition again declaring th 
ight; and the Pergunda, dition against ehf ready with 
ambassadors whom Krishnarâyy sent to Goa immediately after having received the news of tho recapture of that place by the Portuguese in November 1510. In this letter Fr. Luiz informal Albuquerque "that the king of Narsinga was getting himself ready with fire thousand meu ou foot and two thousand ou borse, for an expedition against one of his vagsals who had risen up in rebellion and seized the city of Perganda, (the rebel) declaring that to himself belonged the kingdom itself by right; and that directly he had taken the rebel the king would proceed with all this force of men to his places situated on the edge of the sea." There can be little doubt, I think, that the rebel spoken of in the letter is the Raja of Ummatûr, Pergunda has already been correctly identified by Mr. Sewelll with Penakonda in the Anantapur district, situated about half-way between Vijayanagara and Sivanasanudra, and the war would thus appear to have arisen from a dispute about this hill-fort. This view is further strengthened by an insoription at Hôņakanahalli in the Guņdlupête tâluka,? where Chikkarāja-Odegar, the lord of Umniatür, is given the biruda Perugonda-chakrésvara. As this inscription is dated in Sæka-Samvat 1426, the Kródbana samvatsara, during the reigu of Narasa, it would seem that the Râjas of Ummatør had taken possession of Penakonda already under Kpislışarîya's predecessor, and tbat it was not until Kșishộaraya's accession to the throne that their claims were serivusly disputel. 
The taking of the forts of Udayadri, Vinikonda, Bellakonda and Kondavidu formed part of Krishnaraya's campaign on the eastern coast against the Gajapati of Orissa Fernão Nunesa tells us that Krishğaraya had a special desire of acquiring Udayagiri, because king Narsyniga (Narasimha) in his testament had enjoined on his successors the necessity of taking the fortresses of Rracholl (Raich ür), Medegulla (Mudkal), and Odigair (Udayagiri). He therefore collected 34,000 foot-soldiers and 800 elephants and arrived with this army at Digary (Udayagiri), which, although its garrison numbered only 10,000 foot-soldiers and 400 horse, was nevertheless a very strong place on account of its natural position. The king laid siege to it for a year and a half, cutting roads through the surrounding hills in order to gain access to the towers of the fortress, and finally took it by force of armis. On this occasion an aunt of the king of Orissa fell into his hands. 
The capture of Vinikonda, the modern Viðukonda, and of Bellakonda, generally called Bellamkonda, is not mentioned by Nunes, probably because these places wero only of secondary importance. He proceeds at once to the account of the siege of Kopdavidu, which I have discussed above, Vol. VI. p. 109 ff. According to inscriptions at Mangalagiri, Kâzâ and Kondavidu the fortress surrendered on Saturday, the Harivớsara of the bright half of the month Âshadha in Saka-Samvat 1437, which, for Saka-Sanyat 1437 expired, corresponds to Saturday, the 23rd June A.D. 1515. 
There remains the statement that the king took alive on the battle-field Virabhadra, the son of the Gajapati. This fact is mentioned by Nunes as well as by Domingos Paes. The latter has only the short notice that, in the war against the king of Orissa, Krishnaraya took captive his enemy's son and kept him for a long time in the city of Bisnaga (Vijayanagara), where he died,5 Nanes' account is more detailed. He tells us that, after the capture of Kondavidu, Krishnaraya continued his march northward until he arrived at Comdepallyr (Kondapalle). After a siege of three months he took it; among the prisoners he made was & wife of the king of Orissa, and one of his sons who was a prince, and seven principal captains of the kingdom, all of whom he sent to Bisnaga (Vijayanagara). When Krishnardya himself had returned to Bisnaga, he summoned

The news of the death of this prince induced the king of Orissu to open fresh negotiations with Krishọaráya, which in the end led to a conclusion of peace. 
Nunes generally shows himself so well informael that there is no reason to doubt that this story also is substautially correct. The only discrepancy between the chronicle and the inscriptiou is rith respect to the date mlion the prince was taken captive. Whereas the Portuguese author asserts that it took place more than three months after the capture of Kondarid u. it would follow from the inscription that it was before that event. Thig is implied not only by the words of the text, which admit of 10 other interpretation, but also by the date of the inscrintion in Ferse 10, which states that in the Saka year inarked by the Munis (7), the towns (3), the oceans (4), and the moon (1), (i.e. Saka-Samvat 1437), in the year Yuvan, on the twelfth day in the inonth Åshadha, (the king) duly performed the gift called tulúpúrusha and gave away many incomparable (ugrabieras in the presence of the god Sûlapāņi, who is renowned in the world as Amaréka, on the bank of the Krishnavêni, which destroys darkness.' This date, although it in incomplete and cannot be verified, is without doubt identical with the date given above as that of the capture of Kondavidu, the Hariväsara mentioned there being only another term for the twelfth day of the bright half of the month Ashâdha. Whether the chronicle or the inscription is to be trusted in this case, I do not venture to decide at present. It is quite possible that the text of the inscription was composed and engraved some months after the event which it is intended to comuemorate, and that the author inadvertently referred to things which had happened in the meantime. But it is equally possible that Nunes has made a slight mistake. god that Virabhadra was taken captive on an earlier occasion. 
The inscripticu concludes with a verse (12) inroking the blessing of Amarosa ou Krishnaraya, The Amarésa mentioned here and in terse 10 is, of course, the god of the templo where the inscription is found.

Krishna Sastui, B.A. It is set up near the Šiva temple at Bangavådi in the Muļubagal taluka of the Kolår district of the Mysore State and bears the representation of a warrior riding on a horse at full gallop. 
The alphabet is archaic Tamil and resembles that of the published inscriptions of the same king. The only Grantha letter which occurs is da of Dadiyre" (1.2). The language in Tamil. Au archaic form is nálgavadn: (1.2) for nângåvadu. Instead of kứnga and Dadiyargal we find the vulgar forms kounga (1. 5) and Dadiyangal (1, 2 f.). Layindáramikkiruna (1. 3) is a Präkridt corruption of Maléndravikrama, The word tonnu (1. 4) is a variant of toru, cattle.'? 
The inscription is dated in the 24th year of the reign of the (Ganga-Pallava) king Vijaya-Narasimhavikramavarman, It records the death of a hero, who was in the service of Skanda, tihe adhiraja of the Båņas, and who fell in recovering cattle which had been seized by three persons.

There is another virakka7 lying near the same temple (No. 102 of 1899), which records, iu the Kaparese language, that a hero met with his death when Båņarasa together with the Maharaja Mahávali-Banarasa attacked Nolamba, Rachamalla, Mayindadiya and Dagiga, and that the Kangavadiyan (i.e. probably the Ganga king Râchamalla) assigned land for setting up this stonel in memory of the hero. Here Båņamahârâja, Banarasa, Mayindadiya and Dadiga correspond to Båņâdhirâja, Bånarija, Mahendravikrama and Dadiya of the subjoined inscription. If Râchamalla could be identified with one of the three Ganga kings named Rachamalla or Rajamalla, this would fix the time of king Vijaya-Narasimhavikrana varman to whose reign the subjoined inscription belongs.

II. HANUMANTAPURAM STONE OF VIJAYA-ISVARAVARMAN, 
The stone which bears the two subjoined records (Nos. 16 and 17 of 1900) was discovered by Mr. G. Venkoba Rao. It is set up in a field at Hanumantapuram near Pennagaram in the Dharmapuri tâluka of the Salem district, Unlike other várakkals, the stone bears no sculptures of any kind. 
The alphabet is Vatteluttu. The letters k, 1 and n resemble those of the Madras Museum plates of Jațilaverman, while y is more nearly allied to the y of the Cochin and Tirunelli plates. In two cases (fa of pada in l. 3 f. and ti of Kattirai in l. 4 of A.) the Tamil form of t or 4 seems to be used. The du of iyandu (1, 2 of A.) is reversed. In dai (1. 3 of A. and I, 4 of B.) the vowel ai is drawn through the consonant d. The d of gå in pattan (1. 5 of A. and l. 4 of B.) and the d of lå in Kaffirai (l. 4 of. A.) go downwards instead of upwards. The language is Tamil. The l of padsnéll dvadan (1. 2 of A. and B.) is doubled, and the sandhi is not observed in Kanaiûr (1. 3 of A.). The locative affix kan, which has been changed into kat before the following le, occurs in both inscriptions (1. 3 of A. and 1. 2 of B.). 
The two inscriptions are dated in the 17th year of the reign of king Vijaya-iávaravarman, who, to judge from the prefix vijaya, seems to have been one of the Ganga-Pallavas, and record the death of two heroes in the service of Kattirai. This title means the king of the forest' and is synonymous with Kadavap, the forester,' which according to Mr. V. Kanakasabhai

No, 5.-A ROCK-INSCRIPTION AT TANDALAM. 
BY E. HULTZSCH, Ph.D. The existence of this inscription (No. 1 of 1892) was brought to my notice by Mr. E. Srinivasachari, Deputy Collector, Madras. It is engraved on a rock near the tank at Tandalam, a village in the Kårvêtinagar Zamîndâri, 41 miles west by north of Arköņam Junction. With the exception of the two Grantha words svasti śre in the beginning, the alphabet is Tamil, and resembles that of the Velúr rook-inscription of Kapnaradêva. 
The inscription is dated in the 10th year of Satti, the king of the Kaďavas, i.e. Pallavas. It consists of two Tamil verses, each of which states that Pallavamahårâja built a sluice for the tank at Tandalam. The donor may have been either a relative of, or identical with, Satti, who, as his title implies, claimed descent from the ancient Pallava dynasty.

The Venkatesa-Perumal temple on the Tirupati hill bears on the north wall of its first pråkåra four Chola inscriptions, which were copied from their (now lost) originals when the temple was rebuilt in the fortieth year of Vira-Narasimhadêta-Yadavaraya. The second and third of these four copies (Nos. 62 and 63 of 1888-89) are dated in the 14th year of " Paratrama hendravarman" and "Paratravarman" -- evidently misreadings of the copyist for Parakesari varman. These two inscriptions record gifts by Såmavai alias Kadavan-Perundêvi, the daughter of Pallava-Perkadaiyar, (and) the queen of Sattividangan alias Sri-Kâdapattigal,"? It is not im probable that this Pallava king Šattividangan (i.e. Bakti-Vičanka), who was a contemporary of the early Chôļa king Parakesarivarman, is the same person as the Pallava king Satti (1.. Sakti), In this case the subjoined inscription would belong roughly to the second half of the ninth century of the Christian era,

No. 6.-CAMBAY PLATES OF GOVINDA IV.; 
SAKA-SADIVAT 852. 
· Br D. R. BAANDARKAR, M.A. ; Poona, The copper-plates, a transcript and translation of which are given below, were originally found at Cambay, called Khambầyati by the people. While a husbandman was tilling his field, his plough struck against a hard substance. On digging & portion of the ground near that spot, he discovered a wooden box, which was so rotten that with little effort he broke it to pieces. It coutained a black dirty object, which, until it was cleaned, was not recognised to be these plates. From the husbandmin the plates afterwards went into the possession of & Gajarầti living at Petlad, which is not very far from Cambay. The Gajariti was very unwilling to part with the plates. I requested Professor Abaji Vishnu Kathavate to intercede in my favour. This he kindly did, and was soon stocessful in securing the plates for me. 
The plates are three in number, each about 13.5" long by 10%" broad. The edges of them are fashioned slightly thicker, so as to serve as rims for the protection of the writing. The in scription is engraved on the inner sides of the first and third plates, and on both sides of the second plate. Two small pieces have been broken off near the lower corners of the third plate, and a few letters are bere and there damaged on acoount of verdigris. Still the inscription is on the whole well preserved and legible throughout. The plates axe strung together by a circular ring, of about 49" in diameter and of about 1' in thickness, passing through holes on one side of each plato. The ring had not yet been cat when the plates were sent to Dr. Hultzsch. The ends

of the ring are soldered into a roughly square soal, which measures 23" in heigur au breadth, and bears, in relief on a countersunk surface, as the principal figure, an image of Garuda, squatting and facing to the full front, with his prominent beak-nose and cxpanded wings, and holding 2 snake in each hand. On Garuda's proper right there is a represeotation of Ganapati in the upper corner, and lower down a charsi and a lamp; and on his proper left, somo guddless, sented on an animal, too indistinot to be recognised, and below her, a srustika. Along the border of the seal are to be seen certain emblems, among which a dagger, a bow and an airow, and a thunderbolt are recognisable. Beneath the central figure certain letters were doubtless ougrayed, but are now almost effaced. The engraving is clear and well executed. The characters agree fully with those of the other Rashtraküța records of this period, viz. the 10th century. The average size of the letters is about f".-- The language is Sanskrit throughout. Excepting the introductory ôm svasti, down to the beginning of line 38 the inscription is in verse; and the rest is in prose, excepting the five benediotive and imprecatɔry verses (11. 61-60) and another VCISO, containing the name of the person who drew up the charter (1. 66 f.). All the versos of this grant, excepting three of the introductory, and two of the genealogical, verses, occur in the Sangli charter of the same royal grantor, viz. the Râshtrakûța prince Gôyinda IV.-As regards orthography, it is sufficient to say (1) that the letter b is throughout denoted by the sign for v; (2) that the letters a, i, n. t, d, p, m, l or v following 7 are doubled; but in the case of jr or thc conjunct duu coming after r, the letter i ord is not doubled. There is also an indifference about the doubling of y following r; thus it is doubled in Någamäryyasya in 1. 60, but not in Nügumirydya in 1.52 ; (3) that the letter dh is doubled (withi & in the usual manner) in conjunction with a following 4, once in Osamvaudhyamána® in 1. 42; and (4) that the final n of a word, instead of being changed to an anusváru, is twice joined to a following p, in pulakam=půyát and plantileimpat?ık in 1. 4.-- As regards prosody, it is worthy of note that the metre of verge 7, which cccurs also in tile Saágli grant, cannot be determined. There can be little doubt that it is an instance of a half-equal metre (ardha-sama-vrilta). But it cannot be identified with any one of the half equal metres, given in ordinary works on prosody. There is, indeed, a rule of prosody that any two quarters of regular metres may be combined to form what is technically calleil an upajıiti. But even here the unequal quarters of the verse iu question cannot be sovurally ilcutified with those of the regular metres. 
The inscription is one of the Rashtrakûţa prince Gôvinda IV. or, as he is described in lincs 40-42, the Paramabhattaraka Mahirajautuiraja Paranzésvura, lho liroeperous Suvarnavarsha dava-Prithvivallabha, the prosperous Vallabhanarendradêva, who modlitated on the feet of the Paramabluattarala Mahürüjüdhiraja Puranešvari, the prosperous Nityavarsha, ve. his father Indra III. Govindaraja had, when this charter was issued, gone from his capital Mânyakhôţa tu Kapittbaka near the bank of the Godavari, for the festival of pattabidhia? (1. 16). On that occasion he weighed himself against gald. Wheu he ascended the scales, he bostuvod on Brâhmang gis hundred agrahúras and three lacs of suvarnc coins, and on tomples vight hnuclied villages, four lacs of suvarnas and thirty-two lacs of drunum 08 (11. 46-19). Afterwards, without de scending from the pan, he granted the village of Kévañja, lying near the holy place Kåvikâ and

The term pattabandha, which literally means " binding of the fillet,' has been generally supposed to signify * coronation-coremony; Though cyidence may porhaps be adduced in support of this signification, there can be little doubt that it does not suit here. The earliest record of Govinda IV. gives for him the date Sala 840 (expired), which is prior to Saka 852 (expired), the date of our grant, by no less tlian twelvo years. It is hardly credible that he remained uncrowned for at least twelve years, if puttabandha is to be understood in the sense of coronatiou-oere mony' Besides, in these as well as the Sangli plates he is expressly said to have been permanently settled at liis capitol Minyakheta' when he issued the charters, Again, what can be more unnatural than that a king, instead of getting himself crowned at his own capital, goes to some place far away from it for his corupation? For these reasons, I think, the word pattabandha does not here at any rate mcan coronation-ccrcinony."EPIGRAPHIA INDICA..

Having thus disposed of the formal part of the grant, I shall now give an account of the thirty-one verses, descriptive of genealogy, and of the preamble of the prose passages that follow, After the introductory ôi svasti, the inscription opens with a verde (well known to us from other Rashtrakůta records), invoking the protection of Vishnu and Siva. The next verse is in honour of the Sámcvéda, and the two verses following it (3-4) contain invocations to Vishnu and Sasha. In verse 5 we are told that from the Moon vas descended the race of the Yadue, to the glorification of which the next verse is devoted. After thus bestowing praise on the Yadus, Dantidurgarâja is mentioned in verse 7 as having arisen in the spotless race of the Yadus, as the moon in the clear sky. He was succeeded on the throne by his paternal uncle Kțishnaraja (L.), who is reprosented to have destroyed the Chalukya race, as the sun dispels darkness (v. 8). After Křishnaraja I. his oldest son Govindaraja (IL.) came to the throne, and aftor Govindaraja II. his younger brother, who bore the appellation Nirupama (v. 9-10). Dr. Hlett, who strongly holds that Govindaraja II, did not obtain sovereignty, brings forward the argument, among others in gupport of his view, that the Sârgli charter, though it places Gôrindaraja II. between Krishna I, and (Dhraya-)Nirupanna, " does not make any assertion that he reigned."*1 This statement can only be understood to mean that verse 6 of the Sangli grant, which is identical with verse 9 of our grant, does not explicitly speak of Gôvindarija II. as having become a king, but that his namo occurs between those of Krishparaja I. and (Dhruva-)Nirupama. If this is what Dr. Fleet rneans, then we shall have to suppose that Jagattunga(-Govinda III.) and Amogha. varsha (I.) also did not reign. For verses 11 and 12, in which their names are mentioned, do not tell us in explicit words that they became kings, but simply place them between (Dhrupa Nirupama and A külavarsha (-Krishna II.). Hence, if Jagattuöga(-Govinda III.) and Amogham vareli& I, aro to be supposed to have reigned, Govindaraja II. too must, for the same reason be regarded as having sat on the throne. 
(Dhruvan)Nirupama was succeeded by his son Jagattunge(-Govinda III), on whom nothing but conventional praise is bestowed (v. 11). After Jagattungs(-Govinda III). Amoghavarsha (1.) became king, who, in the first half of verse 12, is said to have gratified the god Yama at Vingavalli with unprecedented morsels of cakes, which were the Obalukyas. This means that he inflicted a crushing defeat on the Eastern Chalukyas at Vingavallî, which, I think probably signifies the Vôngimandala, the territory over which they ruled. The second half of the verse, if I have rightly understood it, seems to mention & reservoir or some such thing

which received the name of Jagattunga-sindhu after Jagattunga(-Govinda III.), father of Amoghavarsha I. 
After Amoghavarsha I. the throne was occupied by his son Akála vargho(-Krishna 11.), of whom verse 13 says that his enemies abandoned the city of Khotaka, which, in my opinion, is here meant to denote Mânyakhêta itself, the capital of the Råshțakuta princes. Two Lastern Châlukya recordsl mention that Guņaka-Vijayaditya III. (A.D. 844-888) " frightened the fire. brand Krishṇa and completely burnt his city, and that “ king Vallabha did honour to the arms of Vijayaditya (III.)." It, therefore, appears that the Eastern Châlukya prince Gunaka Vijayiditya III. defeated the Rashtraküta king Kțishna II. and was in possession of his capital Mânyakbêța, and it is to the act of repulsing this Chalukya prince from Manyakheta that verse 13 of our grant referg. Verse 14 states that Akalavarsha(-Krishọa II.) married the daughter of Kõkkala, who belonged to the family of Sahasrarjuna, i.e. the Chedi dynasty. Now, the Bilhari inscription speaks of Kókkalla as having erected two columns of fame, viz. Krishnaraja in the south and Bhôjadeva in the north. Similarly, the Benares plates of the Chidi prince Karna déva state that Kókkalla's hand, which granted freedom froni fear, was on the head of) Blója Vallabharâja, Sri-Harsha and Sankaragana. There can hardly be a doubt that the Krishna raja of the Bilhari inscription is identical with the Vallabharaja of the Benares plates, and that both are identical with the Rashtrakūta prince Akalavarsha (-Krishna 11.). And the supports which Kôkkala lent to Akálavarsha (-Krishna II.), was given in all likelihood at the time when the latter was defeated, and his capital Mânyakhêta occupied, by the Eastern Chalukya king Gunaka-Vijayaditya III. The last půda of verse 14 tells us that from the union of Akülavarsha (-Krishņa II.) and the danghter of Kókkala sprang Jagattunga, who, in verses 15 and 16, is said to have married Lakshmi, daughter of Raņavigraha, son of Kókkala.. Verse 16 apeals of a prince named Arjuna as having helped Jagattunga with his army and thus enabled him to acquire fame. It does not seen difficult to identify this Arjuna. In verse 20, Arjuna is men tioned as a son of Kókkalla. Arjuna was thus a brother of Rapavigrala, and consequently un uncle-in-law of Jagattunga. And, in all likelihood, it is this Arjuna who seems to have rendered him assistance, 
Verses 17-18 relate that from this Jagattunga ana Lakshmi king Indra (III.) was born. Verge 19 describea a great victory achieved by this Indra. The first ling of this stanza may be thus translated :---" The courtyard (of the temple of the god) Kala priya (becajae) uneven by

& Verge 13 is also susceptible of another interpretation, Khétaka may be taken to denote the inocern Kairis, and the term mandala to refer to the surrounding district. If so, tlo porse must be understood as containing in allusion to Krishňa II.'s having supplanted the subordinate branch of the Rashtialūti dynasty, reigning at Khêtake. But the word parity akta implies that Khotaka, before it was occupied by the enemies, was under the sway of Krishna II., and that, when it was so occupied, he by his prowess compelled the enemies to evacuate it. But ile Rashtrakūtas of the subordinate branch did not occupy Khotaka aud the surrounding district at any time during Krishga II.', reign, but were ruling over it long before him. Again, the word akito as applied to theao tributary Raabtrakuțas does not seein to be appropriate. They are referred to as sulkika-Rashtra kütas wlien their rebellion against Amoghavarsha I. is mentioned (Ind. Ant. Vol. XII. P. 183, and Vol. XIV. 7. 199). Again, they are spoken of as bandhavas when their disaffection towards the Gujarat Rishtrakūta prineo Dhruva II, is alluded to (Ind. Ant. Vol. XII. p. 184). But in no case the word anita or its synonyms are used to dcnote them. For these reasons the second interpretation does not commend itself to me as easily 40 the first, suggested in the text. The latter is much more probable, because we know tbat Minyakhota wis once occupicd during Krishna II.'s life-time by the Eastern Chålukyes, who can, witla propriety, be called his abitas, inasmuch as they were the inortal enenics of the Rashtrakața dynasty.

rosén othala" Indri III. therefore appears to baye marched from Ujjain north vard, CT SCH w to and yoduced the city of Mahôdaya. The lexicon of Hômachandr tells us that Deco duse aud Kušasthala are both names of Kanyakubja, 2.e. Kanaui, so that verse 19 represents Indra III, to have attacked the city of Kanauj. But the complete devastatiun cof Blahôdaga, which Inu za III. is spoken of as having brought about, is merely pootical. Für, the poet's objecu appears to be to introduce a play on the words mahojaya and kuśasthala, which in their con ventional sense mean Kanauj, and in their etymological one, full of high prosperity' and "a spot of lusit gra,98 ' l'espectively: Mahôdnya, le Kananj, ceased to be r odiya, 46, highly prosper uus, and became kursusthula, io, a mere spot of lusa grass. Honce, the complete annihilation of the city of Mahôdaya or Kavauj alluded to in this stanzk cannot be reasonably assumed to be a historical fact. This is also seen from the consideration that, as a matter of fact, for long after the cyent recorded in this verso took place, Kanaus continued to be the capital of several princes, rnling over Northern India.3 What Indra III. actually diu beyond attacking Mahêliya or Kanauj, cannot be inferred from the verse itself. But we can ascertain it with the hulp of other inscriptions. Wo shall, however, in the first place, see wliether wo can decide which of the rulers of Kanauj Indra III. vanquished. The Rashtra kůta records give the dates 915 and 917 A.D. for Indra III. ; and the succession and dates of the princes, reigning at Maliôdaya or Kananj aboui this period, as determinca from the Gwalior, Pubica and Siyadoni iusoristions, al'e as follows: 
1. Bhöja, A.D. 862, 876 and 882. 2. Mahendrapala, A.D. -08 and 907. 3. Kshitipala or Mahîpala, A.D. 917. 
4. Dévapila, A.D. 948.4 Now, as for Indra (III.) we have the dates A.D. 915 and 9175 and for Kshitipäla or Mahipala the date A.D. 917, there can hardly be a doubt that they were contemporaries. And it is alunost certain that it is this Kshitipala whom Indra III. conquered. Let us now ind out what Indra III. did beyond obtaining a victory over Kshitipäle. A Khajuraho

But what country Jagaddhara had in his mind, caunot be accurately made out. lóvarachandra Vidyasagara, in his edition of the Uttararimacharita, mys in a futaute that Kalapve. nântha is the name of a deity installed in Padmaprta in Vidarbha, 1.0, the native town of the wet Bhavabhūti. But this note appears to be based on the cumulent of Jagaddlara just quoted, and, according to I&vxrachandra, it seums that the expression tad-deka must be understood to mean the country to which Bhavabhūti belonged. In the St. Petersburg Dictionary, however, Kålapriyanatha is identified with the Mahâkâle of 11jjayini. This identif tion doubtluss flts here excellevtly, but I have not been able to trace the authority which supports it.

inscription: claims that a king named Kshitipala was placed on his throno by the Chandella prince Harshadáva. As this Flarshadêve flourished at the beginning of the tenth century, the Kshitipala, whom he re-instated on his throne, can be no other than Kshitipala, king of Kanauj, who was a contemporary of, and vanquished by, Indra III. Indra III., therefore, appears not only to have attacked Mahôdaya or Kanauj, but also to have defeated and ousted its ruler Kshitipâla. 
Let us now proceed a step further. The Bhagalpur grant of Nariyana palaasserts that Dharmapala, the second prince of the Påla dynasty, acquired the soveroignty of Mahôdaya by congriering Indrarâ ja and others, but bestowed it upon one Chakrayudha, just as Bali acquired the sovereignty of the three worlds by vanquishing India and other gods, and bestowed it upon Chakrå yudha (Vishnu). The Bhagalpur grant thus tells zzs that Dharmapala first defeated Indraraja and others, and obtained the sovereignty of Mahodaya or Kananj for himself, but gave it over to one Chakrayudha. The same event is referred to in the Khâlimpur charter: of Dharmapala himself, in the verse

दत्तः श्रीकन्यकुबसललितचलितभूलतालक्ष्म येन ॥ The stanza, as it stands, yields no intelligible sense. There can be little doubt that the reading of the last line is faulty, though it occurs, as given here, in the plates. Since we have dattal in the nominative case-- that which is given, or in this particular case abhishek-olla. kumbhaḥ, which is in the nominative case, must go with dattaḥ. Further, the person to whom something is given must be in the dative case ; but we have no such dativo in tihe verse, and moreover the nominative fri-Kanyakuv(b)jak remains unconnected. The sense, however, requires that sri-Kanyakubja should be considered the person to whom the coronation pitcher was given. Evidently, therefore, sri-Kanyakubjah requires to be corrected into sri-Kanyakubjaya, even at the risk of the break of the cosurd. With this emendation, the verso yields the following sense :-"With a sign of his eyebrows gracefully moved, he made over to the illustrious king of Kanyakubja his own golden water-pitcher of coronation, lifted up by the delighted elders of Pañ. châla, and acquiesced in by the Bhôja, Matsya, Madra, Kuru, Yadu, Yayana, Avanti, Gandhara and Kira kings, bent down while bowing with their heads trembling." What the verse means is, that Dharmapåla earned for himself the sovereignty of Pañchåla, and was consequently entitled to the coronation as king of Pañchâla, which was approved of by the neighbouring rulers, such as Bhôja, Matsya and other kings; but he declined it and assented instead to the installation of the king of Kanyakubja. The Panchala country here referred to denotes the upper half of the Doab between the Ganges and the Jumna with Kanyakubja as its principal town, and to this effect we have the authority of the poet Rajaśökhara who flourished about this period. Hence the fact mentioned in the Khâlimpur charter is the same as that reported in the Bhagalpur grant. And

* See above, Vol. I. p. 121 f. Prof. Kielhorn, however, thinks that Harshadeva first vanquished Købitipala and subsequently restored him to his throne. But, in my humble opinion, the natural interpretation that can be put on the verse is that Harshadêva placed Kshitipâla on his throne, who was ousted, not by Harshaddva himself, but by a different king. This interpretation is supported by the fact mentioned in our grant, that Indra III. reduced Mahodaya or Kanauj, in other words defeated the then reigning sovereign, who can be no other than Kshitipala himself. This interpretation, again, agrees with what the Khalimpur and Bhagalpur charters have to say, aw will be shown further on.

piecing together the items of information furnished by these two charters, we find that Dharmapala defeated a prince named Indraraja, and acquired for himself the sovereignty of Mahôdaya or Kanauj, i.e. the supremacy of Pañchila, but conferred it upon Chakrayudha, according to the Bhagalpur plates, and upon the king of Kanyakubja, according to the Khalimpar plates. Further, as Dharmapala wrested the sovereignty of Mahôdaya or Kanyakubja, not from the king of Kanya kubja himself, but from Indraraja, and bestowed it upon the king of Kanyakubja, the conclusion is irresistible that Indraraja must have vanquished the king of Kanauj and occupied his capital before he himself suffered defeat at the hands of Dharmapala. What we ind, thorefore, from these two charters is, that (i) Indrarája vanquished the king of Kanyakubja, but (ii) was afterwards defeated by Dharmapala; and that (iii) the king of Kanyakubja, who was ousted by Indraraja, was restored to his throne by Dharmapala ; whereas the facts we have above ascer tained from verse 19 of our grant and a Khajuraho inscription are, that (i) the Rashtrakata prince Indra III. reduced Mahôdaya or Kanauj and deprived its ruler of his dominions, that (ii) the name of this ruler was Kshitipala or Mahipala, and that (ii) Kshitipâla or Mahipala regained his lost possessions through the assistance of the Chandella king Harshadêve. Thus in both cases we have a king named Indraraja, who attacked Mahodaya or Kadauj and ousted the king of Kanyakubja. The Indraraja,. therefore, mentioned in the Bhagalpar and Khâlim pur grants must be identical with the Râshtrakůţa prince Indra III., and the king of Kanya kubja, whom he vanquished, is doubtless Kshitipals or Mahipala. But the honour of placing Kahitipåla on his throne is claimed for the Chandella prince Harshadêya by the Khajuraho inscription above alluded to, and for Dharmapala by the Bhagalpur and Khâlimpur charters. And what in all likelihood must have come to pass is, that both Harshadêva and Dharmapåla placed Kshitipåla on his throne. 
There remains another conclusion yet to be deduced from the Bhagalpur grant. The king of Mahôdaya or Kanyakubja, whom Indrarâja ousted, is mentioned therein as Chakrayudha. And we have just shown that this king of Mahôdaya was Kshitipåla or Mahipala. Kshitipala, there fore, appears to have borne the epithet Chakrayudha. Now, the Nausari charters of the Rashtra käţa prince Indra III. contain a verse, wherein Indra is represented to have conquered Upêndra. Of course, the terms Indra and Upendra, according to one sense, refer to the gods Indra and Upendra; but when we take them in their other sense, what the verge means to state is, that the Râshtrakůta prince Indra III. vanquished a certain prince of the name of Upêndra. U pêndra is another name for Vishạn, and Vishịu is also known by the name Chakrayudha. The allusion, therefore, in the Nausârî grants most probably refers to the defeat of Kshitipala, mentioned by the name Chakrayudha in the Bhagalpur charter. The Nausari and Bhagalpur grants thus corroborate each other, and consequently there can be little doubt that Kahitipala also bore the epithet Chakriyadha or Upêndra.3 
" In J.B. A, S. Vol. LXIII. p. 62, Mr. Batavyal has expressed the opinion that Indra, brother of the Rashtra kúta prince Govinda 1II., is the same as the Indraraja of the Bhagalpur charter, and the Latåsvara-mandala, which he is mentioned in the Kavi grant to have received from this Govinda III., may be identical with the king. dom of Kanguj. I leave it to those who are interested in the subject to judge of the correctness of this view. 
J. Bo. Br. R. A. 8. Vol. XLIX. pp. 269 and 263. * In bis note on verge 8 of the Bhagalpur charter in Ind. Ant. Vol. XX. p. 188, Prof. Kielhorn suggests that, jast as Bali wrested the sovereignty of the three worlds from the god Indra and gave it to Upåndra-Chakrayudha, his younger brother, 80 Dharmapala took away the kingdom of a prince named Indra and made it over to the prince Chabrayudha, whom, on the analogy of the mythological allusion, he thinks to be a brother of the prince Indra. In this note he proposes, with some diffidence, that this name Chakrayudha points to Adivardha, which was another name of Bhojadáva of Kanauj. In his paper on the Khalimpar plate of Dharmapaladdva (above, Vol. IV. p. 246, note 1) he puts forth the conjecture that there was some connection between Indra and Chakršyudha of the Bhagal par grant and Indriyudha, who is spoken of de governing the north in the colophon of the Jaing Harivania. Pardpa, meaning thereby, if I have correctly understood him, that Indra is identical with Indrayudha and that both Indrayudha and Chakrayudha belonged to onc and the same family.

Two other points of some importance deserve to be noticed. The first is with regard to the date of Dharmapala, who has been placed conjecturally by Cunningham and Prof. Kielhorn in the earlier part, or about the middle, of the 9th century. But we have seen that Dharmapala was a contemporary of the Rashtrakûţa prince Indra III., for whom the Rashtrakūta records furnish the dates 915 and 917 A.D. We thus have positive evidence that Dharmapala lived in the earlier part of the 10th century, 5.e. at least half a century later than he has hitherto been placed. Next, the Mungir plates of Dêvapaladêva tell us that Dharmapåla married Raņņadevi, daughter of the Rashtrakûţa prince Sri-Paravala. Prof. Kięlhorn, who re-edited the inscrip tion, corrects Sri-Paravala into Sri-Vallabha. If this correction is accepted, the Râshtrakûţa kiug, who was the father-in-law of Dharmapala, was either Krishna II. or Indra III. himself. For Jagattunga, father of the latter and son of the former, died without coming to the throne. Further, it appears unlikely that Dharmapala, if he had been the son-in-law of Indra III., would have carried on hostilities, with him. On the whole, therefore, it seems more probable that Krishna II. was the father-in-law of Dharmapala. 
So much for the historical conclusions to be drawn from verse 19 of our grant. From verse 20 we gather that Indra III, married Vijamba of the Haihaya, ke. Chêdi, dynasty. She is therein said to be the daughter of Ammagadêya, who himself was the son of Arjund and grand son of Kókkalla. From Indra III. and Vijâmbå sprang the prince Govinda (IV.), "the beauty of whose form excelled that of the god of love" (V. 21). The first three lines of verse 22 look as if the composer of the inscription were giving of his own accord quite an uncalled for defence to establish the spotless character of his patron Govinda IV. This is enough to lead one to suspect that certain accusations, which the composer tries to confute, were in his time actually whispered against Gôvinda IV. The second and third lines of this verso, as will be seen from the translation, defend him against the attack of sensuality and incest. This indicates that Govinda IV, was popularly believed to have led a dissolute life and even looked upon as inces taous. And, that he had given himself up to sensual pleasures, is mentioned in the Khårêpatan grant and in the Dêôli and Karhåą charters. The former calls him "an abode of the senti ment of love, surrounded by crowds of lovely women.''3 The two latter represent bim as "the source of the sportive pleasures of love" and as “one whose intelligence was entangled in the nooses which were the eyes of women." The Deðli and Karhad charters, moreover, tell us that, in consequence of his sensual courses, he undermined his health and bedimmed his natural lastre. Another sense is also here intended, viz. that Gôpinda IT, inourred the displeasure of his subjects, rendered the constituents of the political body loose, and thus met with destruc tion. To this may be added the further statement of the aforesaid grants that, after Gôvinda, IV. had thus come to ruin, the feudatory chieftains besought his uncle Amôghavarsha to ascend the throne and thereby maintain the Ratta, i.e. Rashtrakůta, sovereignty, and that accordingly he acceded to their request. Mr. K, B. Pathak has drawn my attention to a passage in the Vikramarjunavijaya by the Kanarese poet Pampa, which has an important bearing 
proved that the Indra, who is associated with Chakrayudha in the Bhagalpur charter, was a Rashtrakůța prince, holding stay in the Dekkan, and cannot, therefore, be identified with Indrdyudha, who was ruling in the north, and that this Rashtrakúta king Indra can neither be the elder brother of, nor belong to the game family with, Chakrayudha, who was king of Kanauj.

Now that we know that Dharmapuis was a contemporary of the RashtrakQţa prince Indra III., the mention of the week-day and the regnal year in his Mababodhi inscription can be atilised to determine much more approximately the date of Dharmapaia's açcession, as was first suggested by Cunningham.

on this point. The translation of the passage, as kindly supplied to me by hima, is as follo 6 Arikesari conquered the great feudatories sent by the emperor named Gojjiga ani, dostu the emperor who offered opposition, gave universal sovereignty to Baddogadêvi, who came placing confidence in him (Arikêsari).'l of the personages mentiuned in this passage, All kêgarin (II.) was the patron of Pampa and was a Chalukya chieftain, ruling arer the Jøla country, which in the main coincides with the Dharwar distriot; Gojjigs was the Küchtzakütå sovereigo Govinda IV., and Baddegadêva his uncle Vaddiga alias Amôghavarsha. Now, piecing these facts together, the conclusions that we arrive at, are (i) that Gâvinda IV. uns a Sensual monarch ; (ii) that by his vicious courses he displeased his subjects, and some of his feudatones us may be naturally presumed; (iii) that these feudatories, including Arikásarin II., rose in rebellion against Govinda IV., met him and his tributary allies in battle and killed him ; and (iv.) that Alikësarin II. together with the victorious feudatories requested his uncle Amoghavarsha to occupy the Rashtrakûtu throne, which had fallen vacant by the denth of Govinda IV. 
So far we have dealt with tho second and third lines of verse 22. The bave yet to find out the full significance of the first line, which, as will be seen from the maslation, means to state that Govinda IV. did not practise cruelty towards his elder brother, although he had the power to do 60. This evidently presupposes that, in his time, Gôrinda 1V. was tunguly understood to have acted cruelly towards his elder brother. This is the natural infuruncu 'tu be deducod from the first line, unless it is to be regarded as meaningless. It nov bu loves us to see what probably constituted this cruelty. The name of this elder brother, any known from copper-plate ingaiptions, was Amôgbavarsha (II.), That he caine to the throun cau scarcely be seriously doubted. Dr. Fleet, however, lias taken esception to this view, on the gaul that Côvinda IV., in his Sârgli charter, describes himself as meditating ou the lect ««f11•st his eller brother Amoghavarsha, but his father (Indra-) Nityavarshal Bat this conclusion is directly contra – dicted by the Râshtraküla and other records. The Bhidana and Khårópuan chalters, which scrupulonsly give the list of those Râshtrakuța princey only who reignul mention therein the mame of Ainôghavarsha. The Dêóli and Karhâą grauts, which mention thuse princes, who did not reiga, as specifically not having reigoed, do not speak of suchiurarsha is not having reigned, but on the contrary, furnish positive indications that he dil muiguu Nay, we may proceed a step further. The last mentioned charters assert that Amiglarar'sha II, went to heaven woon after his father's deaub, as if oat of affection for the latter. This inclickles that Amoghavarsha II. reigned only for a very short period. This infereuce receives a strong cura firmation from the Bhådana granti, which distinctly tells us that Amoghuvasha reigned for a year only. Now, plaang together the fact that the duration of Amoghavarsha's reign was very brief, and the implication derivable from the first line of yelse 23 that Gürinla IV. was pop larly supposed to have treated his elder brother, i.e. A mûglavarsba, cruelly, one is zaturally inclined to hold that Gorinda IV. was chiefly instrumental in shortening the period of Amón ghafarsha's reign, or that, in other words, Govinda IY., if not actually caused, at any rate bastened. the death of his elder brother and usarped his throne.

th 
positive evidence, looking quite the other way, furnished by the copper-plate inscriptions, and to render the first line of verse 22 void of all meaning, 
The last line of verse 22 tells us that Gôvinda IV. was known as Sahasååka in conge quence of his unparalleled heroic deeds. Verse 23 states that, although he had the appella tion Prabhûtavarsha, he was styled Suvarnavarsha, because he rained down showers of gold and made the whole world golden. This means that Govinda IV. had previously the usual epithet Prabhůtavarsha, but that, ou account of his profuse munificence, he earned for himself the additional biruda of Surarvavarsha. And deservedly was be styled Suvarņavarsba. It has been mentioned above, in the summary of the contents of the formal part of the inscription, that Govinda IV. weighed himself against gold, bestowed upon the Brahmans no less than six hundred grants, together with three lacs of suvarnas, and granted, for repairing temples and feeding and clothiug ascetics, eight bundred villages, four lacs of suvarnas and thirty-two lacs of drammas. Such exuberant liberality no other prince of the Råshtrakůta dynasty eyer displayed, so far as their records inform us. 
Little that is historically important can be gleaned from the remaining verses (24-31). Some historical fact, however, is undoubtedly contained in verse 28, wherein the Gange and Yamuna are represented as doing service at Govinda IV.'s palace. The exact sense of this can be determined by the consideration of two other epigraphic references to the same fact. The Baroda charter of the Gujarat Râshtrakůta prince Karka asserts that Govinda III., “after taking away simultaneously from his enemies (the rivers) Ganga and Yamunâ, charming through their waves, attained to the best and highest rank, by means of the display of the actual signs of thoso rivers),""! This clearly means that Gôyinda III. wrested the territory intervening between the Ganges and the Jumpa from a prince belonging to some northern dynasty, and assumed their signs as a part of his insignia. The same fact is mentioned in a Nerûr grant, wherein the early Chalukya prince Vijayaditya is represented as fighting before his own father with the hostile kings of Northern India, and securing for his father Vinayâditya the signs of the Ganga and Yamunà among other insignia of paramount sovereignty. When, therefore, the Ganga and Yamuni are mentioned as doing service in the palace of Gôvinda IV., a similar thing is intended, vit. either that, after an expedition of conquest against Northern India, he added the signs of these rivers to his insignia, or that he inherited these signs from some one of his predecessors, perhaps his own fathou Indra III., who, as we have seen above, overran Northern India. 
There now remains to be noticed the preamble of the prose passages, preceding the formal part of the inscription. These set forth the various appellations by which Govinda IV. was known. The topic of the appellations of the Râshtrakuța princes has already been handled in 
1 Ind. Ant. Vol. XII. p. 160, text lines 22 and 38. Here Dr. Fleet perceives a distinct allusion to some conquest over the Chalukyas, whether Western or Eastern, and further propounds the theory that the Rashtra kütas wrested these signs from the Chalukyas, and the Chalukyas from the Early Guptas (loo. cit., pp. 167 and 248 ; Dyn. Kan, Distr. P. 338, note 7). In my humble opinion, the word cha in the second line of the verse, wherein Govinda III.'s assumption of the signs of the Ganga and the Yamupa is mentioned, clearly indicates that he first conquered the regions round about the Ganges and the Jumna and then adopted the signs of these rivers as part of his insignia Dr. Fleet himself recognises this fact (loc. cit. p. 157). If so, I cannot understand how Govinda III. wrested these signs from the Chalukyay, whether Western or Eastern, who were roling in the Dekkan, far away froin the Ganges and the Jumna. Again, I fail to understand how the Obalukyas, towards the end of the seventh century, wrested these signa from the Early Guptas, whose power was extinct by the middle of the sixth century A.D. The view which I have put forth here is, that an expedition of conquest in the regiong round about the Ganges and the Jumna entitled both Govinda III, and Vijayaditya to add the signs of these rivers to their insignia. Tbe same may also be said in regard to Govinda IV.; but, as we do not kaow for certain that he ever invaded Northern India, and as we do know that his father Indra III. overran it, it is equally reasonabla to suppose that Gåviuda IV. perhaps inherited these signs from his father,

detail by a much abler antiquarian than myself. I shall, therefore, le as brief is poss? The first of the appellations mentioned of Gôvinda IV. is Nitya-Kandarpa, which bo 18 satt to have received because he outshone the god of love. Ili accordance with this, verse 21 SPA of him as & prince," the beauty of whose form excelled that of the god of love." His To India III. also bore the appellation Ratta-Kandarpadêva, from which it may be intelle that the Rash trakuta kings had some of their biridas ending in Tundurp... The second of these appellations is Chanakya-Chaturmukha or (the god) Brahman (iu rogard to the at : Chanakya,' ,, civil polity. What this phrase signifies is that, just as the Vedns en anabeu from the god Brahman, so civil polity originated from Govinda IV. His third appellation in Vikranta-Narayana. This reminds us of the epithets Vira-Näráyana and Kirti-Nâra y apling borne respectively by Amoghavarsha I. and Indra 111.,and points to the conclusion that some of the Rightrakúta birudas ended in Nürdyana. The last appellation of Gôvinda IV. referred to in the preamble is Nřipati-Trinêtre, which corresponds to Maharaja-Sarva, mentioned by the Gajarêt Râstrakůta records with reference to Amoghavarsha I. The titles of Govinda IVey ocouring in the formal part of the inscription, are too general to require any special notice. 
As regards the places mentioned in the grant, Kêvanja, the village granted, is the Kimoj or Kimaj of the present day, Kävikå the well-known Kavi, and sihukagrama the modern Sigam or Sigim. The names of these villages occur in the "Inscriptions from Kävi ** by Dr, Bühler, under the slightly altered forms of Kômajju, Kåpika and Sihugräna. It deserves to be noticed that Kârika is in our inscription called a manisthina, de, & holy place. This indicates that Kåvikå or Kåvi was not formerly noted ns a more sacred place of the Jainas, as it is now, but was a centre of Brahmanisı, and that its sanctity goes back to the beginning of the tenth centtiry A.D. It is also interesting to note that Kévaüja, the village granted, is said in our plates to be situated in the Khêtaka district of the Laţa dišu. This implies that the province of Låta jucluded the city of Khêtaka or Kaira, and is a small portion of territory to its north, as may naturally be presumed. The view of Dr. Bühler and Pandit Bhagwanlal Indrajie that Lâţa corresponds to the country between the Mahi and the Koökan or the Tapti is, therefore, not tenable, and that held by Dr. Hultzsch7 that it extended as lur north as the Shëri (Shadhi) is correct,

[VOL. VII. 
RUMAH INI 
(V. 3.) May that Kéśava (Vishnu) protect you, on whose person horripilatiou was caused by the waves, which sprang up in the milky ocean agitated by the revolution of the Mandara mountain, and which were reddened by the dense washings of quantities of red chalk of the best of the elephants, emerging from the ocean),-(washings) which were mixed with the saffron of the numerous (murks of) female crocodiles on the full breasts of Śzi! 
(V. 4.) May these ten hundred hoods of the lord of snakes dwelling on the head of Sambhu (Siva) clestroy your sin, -(hoods) which with the light of their jewels shine all round the forest of the mass of matted hair, and which bear the beauty of the circular basing of the wisłı-giving creepers (consisting of) the lustrous rays coming from the root, (viz.) the moon sprinkled by the celestial river (Ganga) flowing on high ! 
(V.5.) From the Moon, (who is) the royal swan of the lotus-plants of the lake (vis.) the sky, filled up with a crowd of lotu ses (which are) the group of stars; (who is) the white parasol of the great king Cupid wielding the sovereignty of the three worlds ; (who is) the milky ocean of beauty ; (who is) the silvery mountain (Kailasa) of lustre; (who is) the ear-ornament of the dainsels (viz.) the quarters; (and who is) the dwelling-mansion of the goddess of wealth of the three worlds, there arose this race. 
(V. 6.) From that race) sprang up the family of the Yadus, (which was) the paternal residence of wealth, the abode of magnanimity, the pleasure-house of lawful conduct, great Tirosperity and gravity, (and) which acquired fame by the protection of distressed beings, just as the ocean (is the family-house of the goddess of wealth, the abode of grandeur, the play-ground of steadiness, vast magnitude and profundity, and is renowned for sheltering all creatures that come to it). 
(V. 7.) Then there arose, in the spotless family of the Yadus, Dantidurgarâja, to whom the hosts of (his) enemies bowed down, who was versed in arts, (and) who filled the directions by (his) extensive and great fame, just as the moon (rises) in the clear sky, to whom other orbs but clown, who is possessed of digits, (and) who fills the quarter's by (luis) extensive and profuse rays. 
(V.8.) After him the prosperous (and) glorious Krishnaraja, the paternal uncle of that king--having ascended the pre-eminent (and) glorious lion-throne of the brave, as the rising sun (ascendis) the peak of the Meru (mountazz) ; having destroyed the vast race of the Chalulyas, as the sun destroys) utter darkness ; (and) having placed his faot on the heads of kings, (as the sun casts) bis rays on the tops of mountains,-- pervaded the whole universe by (huis) extensive powers, (as the sun fills) the whole world with (is) overspreading rays. 
(V.9.) From him was born Govindaraja, whose panegyric is seen, as it were, (engraved) nu the gurface of the stone (viz.) the disc of the moon in the form of the mark which is dark by the burning of (his) enemies. 
(V. 10.) His younger brother, possessed of burning lu atro“ (and) bearing the other appellation of Nirupama, became king, whose intellect was adequate for the protection of the world, who uprooted the continuons line of the family of (his) enomies, (and) by means of whose seal even the sea became renowned as samudra (sealed). 
(V. 11.) After him flourished Jagattunga, whose princely enemies, deprived of the extent of all their territory, (became) like the breasts of women destitute of youth.__(breasts) which are horn of all their plump circumference. 
This refers to Airavata, the elephant of Indrs, who was produced by the churning of the milky ocean. 
* I am inclined to hold with Dr. Fleet that Iddhatėjas is not a mere attribute of Dhruva-Nirupana, but is iutended to represent one of his birudas (Ind. aut. Vol. XII. p. 252; above, Vol. VI. p. 172 f.). But I am by no beans certain of it, as other Raahtrakata records do not mention it.

(V. 16.) She became the wife of that king who had no enemy (and) who was possesse rf the ornament (consisting of) fame acquired by Arjuna who had a terrific arıny, (as Ajatašatru, i.e. Yudhishthira, was adorned by the ornament (which was) fame earned by Blîmasena and Arjuna).

(V. 18.) Truly he was Indraråja, whose arm was thrust forth for the destruction of the partizans of all kings swerving from lawful conduct, (and) who was fit to be seen with untwink ling eyes, as the god Indra) discharged (his) thunderbolt to cut off the wings of all mountains swerving from their motionless condition (and) is fit to be seen by the gods whose eyes) du put twinkle. 
(V. 19.) The court-yard (of the temple of the god) Kalapriya (became) uneven by the strokes of the tusks of his rutting elephants. His steeds crossed the unfathomable Yamuna which rivals the sea. He completely devastated that hostile city of Mahôdaya (also, the highly prosperous city of his enemy), which is even to-day greatly renowned among men by the name at Kušasthala (also, a spot of mere kusa grass). 
(V. 20.) That Kókkalla, who was mentioned (as belonging) to that family of the illustrious Haihayas, which brought down the pride of Daśa kantha (Råvana), had a son (named) Arjuna,

* Another rendering of the last line is also possible : * and by whom pure fame. . . . . wan, as it were, stored up in Jagattunga, tho ocean, in the shape of (oblation-) water." But this interpretation does not comment itself to me, because the last line is an instance of apahnuti, in which the real character of the subject in hand (prakrita) is denied, and that of an alien object asoribed to it. Tóya is here denied, and muat, therefore, be the prakrita and hence, truly speaking, real. I£ tóya is thus real, then the sindhu into which it is put cannot be fictitious, but must be real. If, however, we take Jagattunga-sindhu ab an instance of mpaka, us here to be done ita case the second rendering is preferred, sindhu ceases to become real. If, on the other hand, we accept the first translation proposed in the text above, Jagattunga-sindhu is no longer & ripaka, and sindhu is made real, and thus the full significance of the apabnutyalankára is brought out; but we may perhaps adopt the socond rendering and gay that the composer of the inscription was not such a learned poet as to employ the apan nutralandre consistently throughout, 
& See the introdnctory remarks. 
• See the introductory remaria. 
• Dr, Fleet thinks that Rajamdrtanda is probably & Biruda of Indra III. (above, Vol. VI. p. 176 and nota g). This seems to be borne out by the spurious Wadgaon grant (Ind. ant. Vol. XXX, p. 278 and note 79),

pre-eminent in virtue. His (Arjuna's) Bon, who was exceedingly strong, fuas Ammapad From him was born Vijâmbâ, as Lakshmi (was produced) from the ocean and Umâ from lord of the mountains called Himavat. 
(V. 21.) To the glorious king Indra was born by that Vijâmbâ & son, the prince Dar Gôvindaraja, the beauty of whose form excelled that of Kima. 
(V. 22.) Ignominious cruelty was not practised (by him) with regard to (his) elder brotber, (though he) had the power; (he) did not obtain infamy by evil courses sach às (illicit) intercours with the wives of (his) relatives ; (he) did not through fear resort ta diabolical conduct which is indifferent to what is pure and impure; (and) by (his) munificence and unparalleled heroic deeds he became Sahasanka in the world. 
(V. 23.) Though he was Prabhutavarsha, he was called Suvarnavarsha by the people, because, raining dowu showers of gold, he made the whole world consisting solely of gold. 
(V. 24.) There being no mendicant at the door when there was made the proclamation who is the gupplicant and what does he want? who is impoverished on earth ?-even the treasure which was brought (to him) in abundance by the easily conquered lords of the continents did not please him. 
(V. 25.) On the occasion of his conquest of the quarters, the earth, with uplifted hands (consisting of his) mighty pálidhvajas (and) abandoning other kings, forth with quivers as if by the causing of a violent bustle (as a woman, when freed from an evil lord, dances with uplifted hands as if through intense joyous excitement). 
(V. 26.) Even the sun and the moon, as if with fear produced in their mind at the thought) that he, the prosperous one, will not bear the rising up of another lord of a mandala (country), run bofore him (inasmuch as they are the lords of mandalas, .ü. orbs, and are samuddhata, 6,0. rising in the sky). 
(V. 27.) For long shines his gateway (marked by) the moon who is like him), (and) decorated near (his) palace, before which other lords of mandalas bow down, which is accom panied by the goddess of victory, and where the whole mass of his lustre (is seen). S 
(V. 28.) Surely (thinking that) he cannot bear the army of (his) foes, which is equal to his own and) which is possessed (of men) of excellent qualities, the Ganga and the Yamuna resort to his flawless royal abode (because they themselves alle samavähini, i.e. flowing in a level, and possessed of excellences). 
(V. 29.) While this king was administering excellent government wherein (all) enemies were subdued, there was vimanasthiti (i.e. sitting in celestial cars) among the gods (nabhôga), 
(bul) there never was vimanasthiti (i.c. transgression of proper bounds) in enjoyments (bhôga).. 
(V. 30.) The blue clouds (are) the soot springing from the copious fames of his luxuriant fire of hercism. The flashes of lightning (are) but the spreading-out of the gleams of the blade of (his) flourished sword. The stars (are) but the pearls issuing in consequence of the splitting-open 
There can be no doubt that the stanza is intended to yield two senses, as the words pranita and košo unmis. takably indicate. One of these senses is that given in the text above. What the other senge is cannot be accurately made out. It seems to refer to s lexicon composed by a certain author, who bore the name Hélksiddha or Dyipanathi, or & name equivalent to either of these words in meaning: Is it Helârâja or Kshirasyömin? We most await further researches to settle this point. 
* This probably refers, I think, to the figures of the sun and the moon on his banners. 
This is a very knotty verse. I have, in the main, followed Dr. Fleet in point of the separation of words and translation. But I am by no means certain of either. Must we split up the third line of the stanza into sa. malina-karotfæranan and translate it accordingly? 
Bor the historical fact contained in this stanza, see the introductory remarks.

And the boundaries of this village (are), to the east the boandary of the holy place of Kåvika, to the south the village named Samagam, to the west the village of Sihuka, and to the nuth the boundary of the lands belonging to the same (holy) place named Kåvikâ. No one should cause hindrance to Naganarya while cultivating this village called Kêvanja, thus defined by the four boundaries, or causing (it) to be cultivated, while enjoying (it) or allowing (others) to enjoy (it). 
* So the word karmanta is explained ia Monier Williams Sanskrit- English Dictionary, ? Gupta Inscr. p, 97, note 6. 
: Darinpiirnamisa denotes * (the days of) new and full moon, ceremonies on those days (preceding all other ceremonies);” ashtaka, “the eiglıth day after full moou (especially that in the months Hémanta and Sisira, on which the progenitors or manes are worshipped, .. . also a name of the worship itself or the oblations offered on those days);” and ágrayana, when masculine, " the first soma libation at the agnish(oma sacrifice," and when neuter, “oblatiou cougisting of first-fruits at the end of the rainy season." - Monier Williams' Sanskrit- English Dictionary, 
+ Charu is *au oblation (of rice, barley and polse) boiled with butter and mille for presentation to the gods or manes) ;" puródaín, "a mass of ground rice rounded into a kind of cake (usually divided into picces, placed on receptacles);” and sthalipaka, "& dish of barley or rice boiled in milk (used as an oblation)."- Monier Williamago Sanskrit-English Dictionary. 
A ima signifies “the act of making an oblation to the Devas or gods by casting clarified butter into the fire ;' and niyama, "any act of voluntary penance or meritorious piety (esp, a lesser yow or minor observance dependent on external conditions, and not so obligatory as yama)."- Monier Williams' Sanskrit.

o The word sattra signifies an alms house and is frequently met with in the Gupta inscriptions (e.g. Nos. 7. 8. 9 and 10). Prapa denotes a place of diatributing water gratis to travellera; pratisraya is "# shelter-house for travellers” (Ind.' Ant. Vol. XII. p. 142). Both these words occur in the celebrated inscription of Ushayadáte åt Narik. which records his series of benefactions. Triahotsarga, according to the Sabda kalpadruma, means "getting Preesbull and tour heifers on the occasion of a fr&daha or As a religious act generally." As regards the details of this ceremony, see this lexicon, sub voce.

No. 7-THE INSCRIPTIONS IN THE CAVES AT KARLE. 
By E. SENART; PARIS. The Editor of the Epigraphia Indica has been good enough to make over to me two sets of inked estampages of the inscriptions at Kârlê and at Näsik, which he caused to be taken in the year 1899 by his Assistant, Mr. G. Venkoba Rao; and he has kindly requested me to con. tribute a brief commentary on the Plates of them which he intends to issue All these records have been commented on before by such scholars as Bhandarkar, Bhagwanlal Indraji and Bühler. Still, I cannot resist the temptation of adding my modest gloss in the wake of their learned inter pretations. Nobody will expect, however, that I shall arrive at startling new results. 
The difficulties with which the explanation of these precious documents has to cope are on the whole due to two causes- (1) their imperfect state of preseryation; and (2) the employment of a certain number of obscure terms or formulas. Since the comparatively recent date to which the precediug treatments of these inscriptions belong, feir important new materials have conie to light. On the other hand, as regards fac-similes, the Plates now issued may at first sight appear more imperfect than those which were published by the Archeological Survey. But, having worked direct from the inked estanpages, I can testify that the new Plates seem to have beeu executed with scrupulous care, and that the collotypes are purely mechanical reproductions of the estampages. Of course they do not show all the details of the originals -- because this is impossible, but they have not been subjected to any touching up by hand. The estampages were made quite rocently; and, in the course of several years which separate them from the carlior copies, the disintegration of the rocks which bear the inscriptions will have continued, and characters which existed before may have lost in clearness. Is this enough to account for the difference between the old and the new Plates ? It seems to me that the former, or at least portions of them, were touched up by hand in details. These retouches, which were executed by competent readers who worked from the monuments, certainly have a value of their own. Nevertheless they imply certain minute alterations which are hardly compatible with the scrupulous care that is now considered indispensable in such matters. I am dwelling on this point only in order to vindicate myself for not appearing to be quite so well informed as my pre decessors in the treatment of several passages, and besides, for admitting that certain apparent readings of the earlier fao-similes do not exclude a priori some slightly different hypotheses. I do not know if, in this field of enquiry and in the present state of our knowledge, it is not more dangerous to afirm too much than to be too cautious. It goes without saying that I have nowhere neglected the invaluable help which the earlier reproductions and transcriptions furnished ; if reduced to my own resources, I would have had to leave more than one lacuna in the texts. Nevertheless the readings which I propose are such as I consider to be actually warranted by the context of the estampages which I have in my hands and which are represented by the new Plates. In several cases where, though believing in & certain transcription, I do not venture to affirm that it is perfectly sure, I enclose in square brackets the letters which to my mind are more or less doubtful. I confess that even this distinction has not been a very easy matter, One need only look at some of the Plates in order to understand that in many cases, if the reading hardly admits of any doubt, the reason is that it is corroborated either by the

authority of parallel passages or by the evidence of the context in which it occurs. Notably: in a vast number of instances it is perfectly impossible to decide whether we have to deal with iutentional strokes or with accidental cracks of the stone. This observation refers to the vowel signs, and especially to the anusuára. The latter, we know, is frequently omitted; bence 1 is all the more uncertain in doubtful cases. Fortunately these are details of secondary 1m portance, at least for the interpretation. Is there any need to add that I have scrupulously recorded all the various readings of former editors whenever they are of any interest, 2.e. unless they are due to palpable mistakes or to misprints ? 
The chief value of these documents consists in their throwing light-- though dimly o n a number of historic, palæographic and linguistic problems. But they are not the only documents of their kind, nor are such documents our only source of information. Though interesting, it is unwise to take up general questions in connection with a partial pablication. This manner of proceeding is ioevitable in the first period of researches and of discoveries, but later on it is apt to scatter the information inordinately and to hamper its discussion. It is at any rate natural to rescind the explanatory remarks and the historical conclusions. To my re-edition of the texts and to the explanations which it will suggest to me, I propose to add as l postscript the more comprehensive remarks which appear to be called for. 
The really useful bibliography of the Kârlé inscriptions comprises only two works (1) Inscriptions from the Cave-temples of Western India, 1881 (CTI.), and (2) Reports of the Archaeological Survey of Western India, Vol. IV., 1883 (A.S.). In the first publication, Dr. Burgess has transcribed and translated the inscriptions in accordance with the readings and remarks furnished by Pandit Bhagwanlal Indraji ; and in the second the texts and explanations have been subjected to a fresh revision by Bühler. Though this edition is more recent and marks in the majority of cases a progress on the irst, it has the drawback of assigning texts of the same locality to different chapters according to their official or private character. The new Plates follow Bhagwanlal's numbering. I have added in brackets the number given in AS. ; « K." refers to the chapter entitled “ Earliest Kârlo inscriptions" (p. 90 ff.) and" Ksh." to "Kshatrapa. and Andhra inscriptions" (p. 98 ff.). The remarks regarding the position of each inscription are copied from the labels accompanying the estampagos.

TRANSLATION. " (This) lock-mansion, the most excellent one in Jambudpipa, has been completed by the Setthi Bbûtapala from Vaijayanti." 
Vaijayanti seems to have been the ancient nano of Bapavâsi in the North Kanara district, Bombay. In addition to the instances quoted by Dr. Burgess, where Jayanti seems to represent Banavåsi, one might perhaps ask if in the Banavâsi inscription% the letter which has been read :( or sair before jayaritakasa (1.2) might not be a ve, in which case the sculptor Damðraka would be designated as a native of Vaijayanti._ In spite of the general meaning of selaghard, it seems-- if we compare the occurrence of chaityagyiha at Kudâ (CTI. Nos. 15 and 20), of Chetiyaghara at Nåsik (Nos, 18 and 19), of gharamukha and gharasa mugha at Kârlê (Nos. f and 6), and of gharamulcha at Ajanta (CTI. No. 1)- that the expression grisa or ghara was habitually restricted to the halls used for worship, those which are generally styled "chaitycı caves." - The expression parinthapita implies the idea of completion, which must not be lost sight of. Even if one leaves out of consideration the open screen, the decoration of which may be secondary, several inscriptions describe certain pillars as particular gifts. Hence it may be assumed that the present record attributes to Bhû tapåla the honour of having completed the chaitya cave.

Though there can be no doubt, I think, regarding any important detail of the text, the inscription is much worn, and the certainty of some points, 6.g. the initial a of Agimitranaka and the th of thabho, is in some way only a moral certainty. I do not venture to affirm that there is no anusvára on the right of si, but incline towards the negative.

Mabârathi is an obscure and difficult term. It would be essential to know first whether the actual orthography of the inscriptions is Prathi or Prathi.

The writing of t7 by error for th being more probable than the reverse, the form Blandrathi is the proper one to start from, 3 If this is the case, the comparison with the epic epithet Maharatha and with brihadratha must be discarded.

This is also Bühler's view (AS, p. 107, bote); but the special reason which he addnces in support of it is not at all decisive, viz. that in the Kärlê inscription No. 14 Oklulukiyiiquiin Mandrathi should be translated by the Ala77 åroti ot the Oklalakigas." Notlıing firoves that the genitivo depends on Blancraini. Several instances sur us tho p'oper lame of a donor accompanied by the name of the tribe or the people to which he belongs in the genitive plural, e.g. Junnar Nos. 5 and 6 (CTI. and As.). The fact that, in the other cases where we find the word again anul in that same No. 14 in the very next line, Mani. ratli does not govern & genitive, forces us to reject: altogether the construction proposed by Bühler. Hence this instance cannot furnislı, as he thougłt, a positive argument against the interpretation proviously proposed by Gaircz, who saw iu it a kind of ethpical 29ne equivalent tu Muratha. Etymologically this explauation seems to me strongly supported by the 11, which TEL-92117Ust 2 Sanskrit firm BluhůrishfritBui Huhiirushtrin has not necessarily a geographical Tucaning, and it is diilica]t to separate tlie word from Malábuja and Mahusamanta, which are Cullected with it in our inscriptions. As rúshtra of ten mans a province, it is azite natural ihat ríshtrir fullows the sun analogy an bhôja and sumanita, so that, if Alandhója has become a title applicd even to wonen, the same could very casily happen in the case of Drahârci s7 trin and Malunisktrini, or lahiruļli and Manerațhine. This is possible, but not abgolutely certain ; it may as well have been that the name, starting from the geographical and ethnical meaning, became fiscd as a tiile ef licuiour in certain families, perhilēve becauso of certain importants relative's or of special circunstauces. It may be notecl tut tu onr Mulärathi Agimitranaka corresponds a Alaluirathi Mitadefa in No. 14; that this Alitadeta is a Kaasikipu tin, like Vislışudatta at Blåjå (No.2); and lastly that the Maheruthini Samadiniki at Bedsân (No. 2) was married to an Apadtranaka. Do put these diffcrent names look as if they were connected with cach other in such a way as to suggest the idea that they may have belonged to the same circle of families or relations we find a Sthavira Agimitit, 4.c. Agnimitra, at Kuda (OTI. No. 5). I believe that the names in mala in our inscriptions, as here and as Nandanaka at Jannar (CTI. No. 22), etc., are not different namney, but simply cquivalents of Agaimitrav, Nandag etc. Gotiputra is the same as Gauptipuin, from Gupta.

These may have been speci fied by the word or words which remain obscure at the end of the inscription.

TRANSLATION, 
“Of Dhamma, a Yavana from Dhënukákata." This translation is that of my predecessors. I confess that the explanation of Dhamma Yararosa appears to me somewhat doubtful. At Nasik (No. 18,1. 1) we find & Yavana who was the son of Dharmadêya. But the simple name of Dhamma applied to a Buddhist surprises me." This combination of a propor name with a bribal name in a compound is unusual. In other cases (above, No. 7, and at Junnar, OTI. Nos. 5 and 8) the word Yavano precedes the proper name, and both have the termination of the genitive. On the other hand, an inscription at Juunar (CII, No. 4) supplies & compound which resembles ours at first sight. This is the attribute dhamma nigama applied to a certain Virasêna. It has been translated 'an upright merchant. I doubt this translation for several reasons. First, it is hardly probable that the donor, a simple private per son, should bestow such compliments on himself; what one would expecting is, not an encomium, but a positive statement like the title grihapathipramukha, which resembles dhanmanigama. Further, mrigama does not mean 'a merchant,' which would be negand. Of course the change of e into 4 is not impossible in Prakrit, but it is a priori improbable in & case where the change would produce A confusion with the usual migama, which means, among other things, ' a group of people' or 'a company of merchants.' It is still less credible, if one compares the two expressions, that Dhamma Yayana could be used for an upright Yavana.' Hence I feel tempted to take Dhanma in both cases in a specifically Buddhist sense, and to understand by dharmaregama'a mena ber of the guild of Buddhist merchants ;' compare niganasabhd at Nasik (No. 12, 1.4). On this analogy, Dharma-Yarana would be the community of the Buddhist Yavanas,' or rather a Buddhist Yavana who has modestly omitted his personal name.

I feel inclined to believe that this Mitradáva is the son of that Rishabhadatta who is mentioned in No. 13 and many other inscriptions as the son-in-law of Nahapång. For this name is not yeme common, and I find another connecting link in the name of Rishabhadatta's wife Dakhamitin (Násik No. 11). The silence kept regarding Nahapana as well as the titles and donations of Rishabhadattle would suggest that the inscription is later than the downfall of the Khabaratas : compare Násik No, 4. In the palæographio forms I do not see sufficient 1888ong for derving that the present inscription could be slightly later than No. 13.

TRANSLATION, 5 Success! By Usabhadata, the son of Dinika (and) son-in-law of the king, the E 100% räta, the Kshatrapa Nahapana, who gave three-hundred-thousand cows, who made gifts of gold and a tirtha on the river Bandså, who gave to (the Dévas] and the Brahmazas 81xteen villages, who at the pure tirtha Pabhåsa gave eight wives to the Brahmaņas, and who also fed annually a hundred-thousand (Brahmancs),- there has been given the village of Karajika for the support of the ascetios living in the caves at Valûraka without any distinction of sect or origin, for all who would keep the varsha (there)." 
In explaining these linos, we have to compare closely Nos. 10 and 14 at Näsik. A portion of the first, especially, which is better preserved, comes very near to our text. The river Bandså (compare Násik No. 14, 1. 10) or Bårņaså (Nasik No. 10, 1. 1) is represented in Western India by two rivers named Banås, with which it has been successively identified. The first belongs to Northern Gujarât, passes Palampui, and falls into the Ran of Kachh (Burgess). The second flows through Eastern Rajputana and joins the Chambal (Bargess, and Bhagwanlal Indraji, Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. XVI. p. 638). In Nâsik No. 10, 1.4, we shall see that, after au campaign in the south, Rishabhadatta returned to the sacred lake of Pushkar Dear Ajmere, bathed there, and made pious gifts. Hence it may be assumed that this country possessed a special importance for his family, and it is a priora natural to localise there other donations of his. Now it is precisely in those parts that the second river Banås flows, and until beiter information is obtained it seems to me more probable that this river is here alluded to; but the precise nature of the gifts alluded to is not easy to determine with certainty. The reading duvanutithao is supported by the comparison with Näsik No. 10, 1. 1, where we find suvarnadinatirthakaréna. Oar text is an abridgment of this expression, on which it is besed, just as satasahasara in 1.3 corresponds to brahmaratatasdhaari at Nasik. After having hesitated between the two transla tions 'the founder of & tirtha and giver of a gift of gold and the founder of a tirtha by means of a gift of gold' (OTI. p. 33, note), Bühler seems to have decided in favour of the second (AS. p. 101). I decidedly prefer to adopt the first, like Bhagwanlal (Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. XVI. p. 671). If the second were true, suvarnadina vould represent nothing but a kind of tautology. It is evident that a fürtha canzot be established without expending money. Besides, to take the first portion of the compound suvarnadánatirthakara in the sense of the instrumental is not inadmissible, but rather far-feto bed. Finally, I notice at least one case where the two different ideos are combined in the same way, but in terms which are pot ambiguous. The Naqaparu grant of Annaveral skys - Yên=ågrahara bahavô vitirnd H&madri-dándni kzitani yênal tertheshu sattrâni tatani yana. Though this text is much more modern than that of Karle, it has its value as witness of a tradition whose constancy we shall bave occasion to verify in atill other formulas. We would have certainly found some decisive argument in favour of the correct interpretation, whichever it may be, in the Nesik inscription No. 14, 1. 11, whioh follows & different redaction; but unfortunately its text is mantilated,

the epic legend locates the death of Krishna. In connection with the gift of vie ? Brahmbnas," Bhagwadlal Indraji (Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. XVI. p. 571) aptis quotes the Aphead inscription of Adityasdnet If kanyds are there referred to, while ucre ile d ' speaks of bhdryds, the position is in the main identical. Only, it is in the first case from the point of view of the Brahmanas who were the fathers of the young women, 471) in the 
and second case from that of the Brühmaņas who became their husbands. There is nothing in this yariation to justify the unlikely interpretation which Bhagwandal (from all argument which in my opinion could easily be turned against him) has tried to substitute for the true One, nu that Rishabhadatta boasts of laying given wives to eight Bråbmanas by exempting eight young wome! of the Brilmaņa caste from all the expenses whioh are involved by the costly cuno-Majal of Hindi marriages and the acquisition of the ornaments which in & certain way #PREK'I thie dowry.

Zato The passage in No. 19 was intontionally copied from the present inscription and has therefore in independent value. In botb 04.508 one might be tempted to separate the two genitiver and to let the first dopend on daditi, the second on yapandya or ydpanatha. But the long distance from the verb would be little favourable to this hypothesis. And in Násik No. 2, where yopandya bag no equivalent, it is quite excladed. Besides, in Násik No.3, where & different came is amd, both terms ans, just as here, in the same case. Hence we mnat conclude that in all theke instances the terms bhikhu or samgha, nikdya, and Mahdianghiya or Bhaduyuniya Art 00-ordinato. Thus the donation is made here " for the enpport of the aniversal Surnyha in the person of the monks residing in the caves at Valdraka;" in No. 19 " for the appport of thr brotherhood oonstituted by the Mahislmghikas in the person of the monks (of this commouity) reoiding in the caves at Valúrka"; in Nasik No. 2, "to the Sangha of the monks in the person of the brotherhood constituted by the Bhadayaniyaa; " and so on. We shall we in du. time how the change of the case in Någik No. 3 is to be explained. Here I would only remark that in the two passages of that insoription we find both nikdya and Bhaduyaniya ia the instrumental age and are thus prohibited in No. 19 to construe, as would noem datan), Mahasanghiyana as dependent on nikdy@-- the brotherhood of the Mahlsdghika." 
This point being established, we shall have to fix more clearly than beems to hata been tried hitherto the meaning which our inscriptions assign to the expression shdtudima da shegha.

beyond all particular limitation; and this is why the donor adds saliina risasit ûnan. In fact, it was for the retreat of the varsha that the monks of every other denomination Ol' Iesidence (cheltuiisa sarighe) could be brought to take up their abode in the caves of Valůra ka along WILD their' resident hosts. If the donor had nutant only the monke living at Vilûraka, le rould have said simply Valuraka-saigha, as in the following inscription. In the same way a gift is made in Nasik No. 15, 1. 7, Triraśniparvatavihdravdstavyasya cháturdeśabhiltshusanghaeya gilanabhésha jartzun, ie. "to be applied for the medical treatment of the monks of every orican who shall l'eside in the viháras of the Trirasmi hill.” Monastic communities may be classified in two respects, cis, according to their residence and according to the sect to which there halong. This double restriction is excluded in principle by the mention of the chitudisa sainha, though in some cases and according to the dispositions of the donor it may mean specially one or the other, Thus in Nasik No. 10, 1, 4 f. a donation is made as follows: eto mama Zene vasatzinan ohốtudisasd bhikhrsaghusa mukhtoh aro bhavisati. Here we have a restriction to a certain localityWhile chafudisa exclades only the restriction as to sect; and the donation is accordingly intended for the feeding of the monks who reside or shall reside in this cave, to whatever denomination they belong. The game is the case in Násik No. 12, l. 2, where a rent is allotted to the chátudiso sciglia, Ta] !musmin lens vasa1tina bhavisati chivarika , , .,i.e, "for furnishing clothes to the monks who shall l'eside in this cave without reserye or distinction as to sect." Tho same idea is expressed in the donation recorded in Nå sik No. 24, 1.3 f. On the other hand, in Kärlê No. 20, 1. 3, * hall of nine cells is given to the sangha cháturlisa as property of the Blahásånghikas," ~ Mahásaghiyanan parigaho saghe châtudise ding. We have to compare & Pasgage in the inscription of Töramåņa at Kura (Ep. Ind. Vol. I. p. 240). Buhler has justly remarked the antithesis existing between chaturdisa sangha and parigraha acharya-Manitasa táncm. But I feol inclined to think that he has not solved it in a quite satisfactory manner. According to him "the meaning seems to be that all Buddhist monks shall participate in the use of the vihara, but that it is specially made over to the Mabisâsaka teachers," Does it not rather seem that, in allotting to the châturdiśn saingha the gift which was at the same time made the property of the Mahasinghikas or Mahisis alas, Toramana in the Kura inscription and Rishabhadatta in the present case desired thet their donation should benefit only the m embers of the act which they wanted to favour, of whaloger origin and usual residence ? This conclu. sion seems to be strongly corroborated by the comparison of Kärlê No. 19, 1. 1f., where the village of Karajaka is given. " for the support of the Mahâsâmghika monks residing in the caves of Valûrake, "... lenesu Válurakesu våthavára pavajitâna bhikhuna nikayasa Makdisaghiyana yápanaya. Here the donation is expressly restricted to the Mahà sâmgbika monks residing at Valûraka. Shall we not copelade from this, that, in other cases where the chaturdića sa mgħa is referred to, the gift is made to the Mahabanghikas of whatever origin? While in the preceding examples the wording excluded all restriction as to seot, it excludes here all restriction founded on origin or residence. It is hardly necessary to add that, if used alone and without an explicit clause, the expression excludes both the first and second restrictions. No. 19 informs us that the village of Karnjaka was given to the monks of Valtraka by Vasithipata Pulumâyi or Gotamiputa Satakari. This inscription is certainly later than the present one. Though it does not allude to & previous donation, and though the form Karajike, which we have here, differs slightly from Karajaka, the only form which occurs in No. 19, I think that Bühler is right in admitting (As. p. 113 ; compare p. 24) that the two nanies refer to the same village. The renewal of the donation was brought about by the new stato of affairs created by the victories of Gautamai putra Satakaại and by the destruction, of which he boasta, of that dynasty of the Khabaratas with which our Rishabhadatta was directly connected by his father-in-law Nahapana.

TRANSLATION. "In the seventh-7th-year of the king lord Siri-Pusumâyi, son of Vâsithi, in the fifth-5th. fortnight of summer, on the first 1st day, on the above, by the Maharathi Sômadeva son of Vasithi, the son of the Mahârathi Mitadeva son of Kosiki, of the Okhalakiyas, there was given to the community of Valûraka, of the Valûraka caves, a village with its taxes ordinary and extraordinary, with its income fixed or proportional.” 
I have stated on p. 50 why the genitive Oklabu kiyánań must be connected with Somadevena and cannot depend on Maharathisa. It is the geographical name of a country, or rather of a' tribe, Bühler (AS.) has pointed out the name of a district, Ukhaqa, from which it may be derived. The end of the insoription presents a difficulty which has not yet been solved satisfactorily. Bhagwanlal read sakarákarosa deyameyo, which he transcribed in Sanskrit as saṁskärakarandya dêya éshah. I can hardly believe that Bühler could have approved of such an explanation; but, though he read sakarukao, & reading which seems to be warranted by an examination of the back of the estampage,-- he adopted the same translation as Bhagwanlal in OTI., viz. “ this gift is in order to keep the Valûraka caves in repair." As in his transcription (AS.) he separates

Plarosa deya", I imagine that he admitted that the text was disfigured by screral mistakes, and that he restored samkarakurasa = sankhara". But in this hypothesis the ut of the grenitive tot the dative and the use of kara = litrana would seem inadmissible. This preconceived notion has caused the end nf the inscription after Valürakaranghaca to be considered a separate sentence, Valürakaleránen being necessary for completing the following word. I believe that, if one reads the text without prejudice and keeps in mind the customary wording of grants, one cannot ta to connect the words sakarulcaro sadeyaneeyo with gråmo data, and to take their fur epithets resembling sódranga sôparisara, eton, which occur in other grants in precisely the same place. Besides, by this construction we avoid having recourse to tho expedient of currections, which is always objectionable. The first result is to condenu the break of the wutence between Valûrakasurizglasa and Valürakalenúnan. Those two terns are closely G. 11111*ettail. The gift is made to the Valûraka-lenas, i.e. as the preceding ingcription expressed it in a slightly different way, "to the Valúrakesu lenavásis," of the Surigha of Valûraka. Vilûraka in the general desiguation of the village where the so-called Kårlê caves are situated. Doubtless this locality contained still other monks besides those who had found au asylum on the slopes of the bill. To these last ones was confined the benefit of the royal donation. 
There romain the terms sakarukaro and suleyameyo. It is well kdown and will be noted again more than once how much uncertainty is felt in the Explanation of technical terins repeated incessantly in grants of all ages, which define or describe the rights and advantages conferred on the dopees. If this is the case even in quite a modern protocol, it is not suiqui-ug that we are embarrassed by more ancient formulas which have fallen more or less into disuse, But ours is not without analogies. Kara is so woll known in the sense of duea payable w Gostrument,' that I need not dwell on it. The same is not the case with ritkara ; but aparıkani, which is its exact equivalent, appears alınost invariably at the head of the customary formulas while hiyin generally with sôdrasiga, sôparikara. The meaning of udranga is not yet established. I do not kuow is kara can strictly correspond to it. At any rate, there is no doubt that nothing but a kind of reveuue is meant here, so that in a general way sakarukaro = sakırólkuri lxcimes the natural equivalent of sốdrangalı sôparikaraḥ. The meaning of uparikara is ay little wettled as that of qirasiga, and it will not be wondered at that I cannot be positive regartling tile trnulation of our new torm. The certain meaning of kard, combined with the moditication which is implied by ut or uparn, the first member of uikara or el parikara, secus to recomnend as plausible the general selse which I have attributed to these two terma. 
The adjective which follows has at least the advantage that it can be translatei etymologi. cally-together with what has to be given and what has to be measured,' This is vague, bat not at all unintelligible. Here also, I think, the comparison of the more modern formulas can assist us. Several grants combine with the epithets sóulranga and søpurikura the expression savitableütadmányaliranyadéya.More commonly it is resolved into sabhútavátapratyaya and sadhányahiranyûdêya, which prove that, contrary to the hesitating conjectures of Dr. Fleet (1.0. 1. 170, note 9) and in conformity with Dr. Hultzaob's translation, adéya, what is to be taken,' is nothing but an equivalent of pratyaya, "revenue.' Hence' dhanyaherapyddeya means the revenue both in grain and in specie.' The expression used in our inscription is not quite identical; for we have not sadaya, but sadéya. Nevertheless it scems to me very probable that it corresponds on the whole to the idea expressed by the Sanskrit formula and, like it, embraces 
what is given or paid directly,' 1.. the taxes in money, and 'what is measured,' .e. tbe dues in kind which were levied on the products of the fields. 
Compare in the inscriptions of Jayan&tha and Sarvanátha (Dr, Fleet's Gupte Sunriptions, p. 118, L 9. and p, 137, 1. 17): Ya (gramasya) samuchitabhagablogakarapratydyöpawayan karistyakka,

REMARKS (1) Though the fac-similes in CTI. have only a trace of the long ū, it seems to me very probable from the new estampages that the writer formed an it, as in the following inscription which to all appearances is written in the same hand. One might feel inclined to believe that the letter is only an exceptional form of the short l; but in No. 1 we have found clearly útama beside Bhutapeila. and in No. 13 there are soveral distinct instances of long û. We must therefore transcribe the siga by ti, without forgetting - what is attested by many cases and notably by the numerous inscriptions which do not make any distinction between the long and the short yovel - how negligent our inscriptious are in marking vowels (2) Though this inscription is closely connected with the following one, I do not believe, after minute examination, that, as my predocessors thought, the two inscriptions are absolutely identical. In No. 16 the reading is free from doubt. The same is not the case here. The last letter, which has been read n, looks rather like y with the vowel e, and in the crack between thü and ve there is room for the final n of mithuna. It looks as if an n with t could be distinguished. One might even believe that one sees a distinct ná subscribed to this damaged character, as if the letter above had been spoiled by sonia accidout and subsequently restored below the line. At any rate it seems to me wrong to transcribe the last letter otherwise than by ve. 
TRANSLATION. “ Two pairs, the pious gift of the Bhikshu Bhadasama." If my impression regarding the reading of this inscription is justified, the proposed translation would be certain. In the presence of the following inscription, it would have to be assumed that the donor originally had the intention to perpetuate his double gift by only a single mention, bat that oa second thoughts he added his name a second time on the other pillar.

The r is certain, though I cannot say whether it was accompanied by an å or an 2. The last syllable looks like su ; but on the back the mark for 1, which AS. gives, can be clearly distinguished. — (3) AS. lenasa Valurakasa. The letters vil and ke appear certain. I do not doubt that we have to lead su in both cases, though the vowel-mark is vot visible anymore ; compar he preceding note. The locative is indeed what we would expect.. (4) AS. vathavana The th is not doubtful.- (5) AS, utaramay[e].-- (6) AS. gúm[o] Karajake[84] . . . The final e of g [n] is just possible, as well as the e of ojals[e]. But I do not believe that the nyllable suları any following syllables exist. (7) AS. Blikiuhala; but there is certainly a letter between ha a la, which seems to be le. Its bottom is not exactly in the same line with the neighbouring letters and the top runs into the crack. Could it have been repeated because it had come out badly the first time?-(8) AS. etesa gão. The sa is certainly followed by a letter, which seems to be tu.—(9) AS. gûn[e]. The m is clear and does not bear any vowel-mark,-(10) AS. barajalce[su]. The ke is probable, though the enlargement of the top of the k (compare the initial la) is frequent enough to leave room for doubt. The sat nay have dropped out. But in the rest of the line the projection of the tops of the beams does not seem to have caused any breaks in the inscription. Accordingly, the latter in ust have been engraved subsequently ; or, if auterior, it must have been calculated in such a way as to leave space for those projections.-- (11) AS. papahi. The ki and the e seem cleai. Between "tasa and chasa there is room for two letters, but nothing seems to have been engraved there, unless the traces of the crack in the stone should mark the place of letters which miglit have been engraved by mistake and obliterated subsequently. It seems that the engraver had reserved the necessary space for the top of a beam analogous to the preceding onds, which was, however, not added. (12) AS a[pa]resa . .

It seems to me impossible tu say whether the stone bears eta or ete. I feel inclined to read etan. It is very improbable that the m of gima bore the mark of e. As to the syllable su, neither the length of the following line nor the appearance of the free space after he authorises us to assume its existence. (15) AS, eta nibadho[lehr]. The reading is uncertain. What I propose, pe for le, appears to me on the whole more plausible.(16) AS. . . . . . to rajayathasútáre.

This reading seems to me extremely problematical, especially in the case of the letters ra and ñd. The last syllable of patikd would also remain doubtful if it were not supported by analogous cases.-- (18) I follow Bühler in transcribing the second figure by '4': but he cousiclered it rery doubtful ; and I see w particular reason for reading " 4' rather than any other unit.

There is no neang rif deciding whether this inscription emanates from Vüsislıthiputra Talımayi like Vixik No. 3, or from Gautanîputra Satakarņi liko Kårlè Nos. 4 and 5. I incline burever towards the first hypothesis. The phraseology is quite identical in Nasik Yo. 3 and in the present inscription, and the brenk wlich, to our zegret, we find here, could be filled cractly by what precedes einantyutė in Nasik No. 3.- Mâmála or Mamala has been identifiel (AS. p. 24) with the modern dlawal or Mául along the Ghauts. Regarding alira, compare Dr. Fleet's Gupta Inscriptions, p. 173, note. The final u of pur.gata . nasz and the e of lcresci and Valurakesu seem to prove that we have to lead in each case the locative plural in és 72.26, and that the three Yords are connected, the first being only an epitliet of the second. I propose to restore it as pirrigutuille!1m6S14, which might be it proper epithet of these places, 'n holly devoted to religion.' It is quite clear on the other hand that the analogy of the parallel pashages (Nasik Nos. 3; 2; 
, :) would make us expect in this place. the proper name of the officer. It is only out of despair. sud especially under the influence of the final su, that I have recourse to this hypothesis. The phrase has to be explained by comparing Kärlê No. 13, 1. 4, froni wlich an additional argument in favuur vf the 24ading T'úlurakesu is derived, and Násik No. 3, l. 12 f:Uhikutin . . . . apikúytna Bhuluyaniyeli. The 13th edict of Asoka (KlAlsi, 1. 38) aliearly emplojs nikúya in the particular meaning of religious corporation. Though. pavajila and bhiklu are equivalent in meaning, we find the two words combined elsewhere, 0.g. in Nâsik No.5, 1. 8. As regards the coustruction and the details of the trauslation, I refer to the remarks on Kår·lê No. 14, of which I have stated that our text intentionally imitates the wording. I will only add here that the **instruction of Jahusaghiyana as in apposition to nikayasa, which is furced on us by the comparison of Nisik No. 3, but which is a little puzzling to us, has at least one aralogy, which the geuitive gumasa Karajakána (1. 4) makes obvious, in the frequent constinction of grima with al proper noun, the occurrence of which in the plural seeing to indicate that originally it designated less the locality than its inhabitants. 
Bübler (p. 111) proposed to take maga (márga) as the name of a tenitorial division, which is not found in other documents. He quoted the analogy of pathaka which occurs clsewhere in a similar sense. We have to wait for fresh facts to confirm this conjecture; but even in its current meaning uttara márga, 'the northern road,' the northern direction,' gives a sufficiently good sense. 
Whatever may be the cause of the erroneous form bhikhunalela, it can only be meant for álokhuhalan. Unfortunately the meaning of this expression, which occurs not only here, but alo in Nasik No. 3, is far from distinct. Hala designates in certain cases a measure of land (Ep. Ind. Vol. I. p.:8, note), the extent of wbich varios according to the word which precedes and determines hula ; see dharmahala, Hiiritasmriti quoted by Kullûka on Manu, VII, 119; uriladdhala, inscription of Harsha (Ep. Ind. Vol. II. p. 125), etc. But lala has also the meaning of 'cultivated field,' as in devabhôgahala şi compare bråhmanêncir halakshetra in the Uruyupalli plates (Ind. Ant. Vol. V. p. 52, text line 23), etc. With these expressions we may certainly comparo that of our text. In the Buddhist language, bhill247ala is the equi valent of those religious donations which in the Brahmanical phraseology are termed dôvabhôgu hala, décaddya (above, Vol. III. p. 274, 1. 60) and brahmadiya, and convey, like the buikhulala (hore and Nasik No. 3, eto.), certain privileges,a parihara, which the Maliyâ copper-plates (Dr. Wleet's Gupta Inscriptions, p. 167) gum up by the formula uchitá brahmadêyasthitih. There, as here, the king grants not only a certain portion of land, but the village itself is given away by him as bhikhahala and participates in its entirety of the immunities implied by this 
"Abuve. V.). III. p. 146, 1. 18 f. Admitting that the authenticity of this donation is doubtful, it would bo Devetivas certain that it borrows its phraseology from genuine documents.

In stating that this spelling excluded his earlier explanation. Bühler did not suggest another instead of it. I do not know any parallel expression which count 10 this one finally. The word seems to represent artishdresa rizvirnayika ; but etymology al one is au 11.sale guide in the interpretation of technical terms. Tineti is only used in a moral sense Could we think of trapslating: “exempted from the police, the magistrate of the district (rashtra ; compare Dr. Fleet's Gupta Inscriptions, p. 32, note), or of the rishtriu P" This roulduzuil us of those yrants in which, on the other hand, it is stated that the right of punishing thefts and offences is reserved to the king, or of those in which the right to punish the i tezi offereces 'I is trans ferred to the donee. At least I have nothing more plausible to suggest. It is well known that the different formulas of immunities were variable and always incomplete. And it is not to be wondered at that they should be summed up in a comprehensive and general espression like survajútapdrilůrika. Elsswhere, the texts are more precise in stating that there are eighteeu kinds of immunities. It will be enough to quote the inscriptions of the Pallavas, and notably that op Sivaskandavarman, which reads atthúrasajátipurihiéra (Dp. Ind. Vol. I. p. 6). 
More clearly still than our estampage, those of Nâsik Nos, 3 and I apxar to exclude the leading pariharımha and to recommend the first singular pariharehin. We thu obtain an exact Cjunterpart of the expression employed for the grant of the village. The king legins by 22 nouncing his intention of granting : dadina and vitará nuc in the brst plural. Then he sums up the donation in the first singular : papohiin, pariharchin. 
The reading nibadhiperi[in] seems to be established incontestably hy the comparison of ni badhanetha in Nâsik No. 5. The approximate meaning of this word is nut dwubtiul. Nibandha is a technical term meaning endowment;' see Yajnavalkya, I. 317: cecit mui bluniin nzlandhui Tui kritul lekhyar tu kúrayêt. Hence the corresponding use of the verb nibull. In Nasik No.5, we shall actually find nibadithe nibardhaḥ; this sentence is accompauier by a separate date which is several months prior to the date of the grant. Hence ribuniihir refers to a distinct oficial formality which precedes the completion of the grant. I do not kuu iu what it exactly cousisted; perhaps it was a kind of registration of the royal decision in the archives of the State. The four corresponding passages of this portion here and in Nasik Nos. 3, 4 anil 5 seeni to read.--- 
Kârle No. 19: eta[m] chasa gáma Karajake bhikhuhalaparihåre cha. Nasik ,; 3: eta[m] cho gama Samalipada[i] parihåre cha. 
4: et[6] clasa khetapariháre oha. „ , 5; eta[n] Chasa khetaparihüre cha. In spite of the comparative vucertainty as to details, which the condition of the stono alınoyt always entails, it follows from a comparison of these quotations that the correct reading is etar. not ete. This is supported also by the accusatives gáma Karajake and gam Sunalipadań to which the pronoun refers, and by the following two cases where etar is oonnected with Kheta parikare by the double cha and hence can be nothing but an accusative, with which either: Khetar is to be supplied or which sums up the principal object of the grant in the general fashion. As regards the wording of the phrase, the point in which the four versions differ most obviously is the absenco of the syllable sa after the first cha in Nánik No. 3. At first thought we might feel inclined to resolve everywhere chasa into cha asya, as it has to be done for instance in Nasil No. 11. 2 and 3 (compare Karlo No. 20, 1. 4). The game is just possible in l. 3 of our inscription (etasa chasa gámasa) and in l. 3 of Nasik No. 4 (etasa chasa khetaso), where the tautology Qaya is admissible. But this analysis is not possible either here or in Nåsik No. 4, 1. 54 and

As regards the guess of Bhagwanlal, according to whom chhata stands prolly lur t'i Sanskrit ohhupta, meaning touched,' neither is it admissible phonetically nor is it corrobatelina the analogies which he invoked (Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. XVI. p. 558, note).

The later inscriptions offer us at large quantity of probable or at least possible equivalents. I need not dwell on vinata, the menuing of which is clear; it refers to the announcement of the royal order either by the govereiga himselt, or by his representative who is generally delegated to this duty by the title of dutaka; mes Dr, Fleet's Gupta 1928oriptions, Index, d. V. Besides, frequent mention is made of the manual drafting of the document (likhita) and of its transcription on copper or on stona, expressed ty utkörna; see Dr. Fleet's Gupta Insoriptions, p. 99, note. In the grant of Sivaskaudavarmalı (Bp. Ind. Vol. I. p. 7, text line 50) we read , ... Bhattisormasa bahatthalákhiteru pattek kadatta. The participle Rogata refers here to the drafting, as the writing is expressed by Likhita, while in our inscriptions kațd, which ends the text and whose agent, being always name? without any title, is evidently a subordinate oficer, clearly corresponds to ukirpa; compare the end of No. 35 of Dr. Fleet's Gupta Insoriptione. Besides, I believe that in our documents this 
engraving' does not mean the preparation of the stone, but that of the copper-platea which served as title-deeds to the donees, and of which our epigraphs only state the delivery. Several doormente mention a keeper of records (Akshapatalika or Akshaftlika), who donwquontly mast 
for, Rohani. have been in charge of the documents. I believe that such an officer yaa Robari gutta-ti must be read who is mentioned at the end of the grant of Vijayabuddhavárnau (Ind. Ant. Vol. IX. p. 102). In this conneotion we have to understand the word "para hua in Nigik Nos. 3 and 4. If it is not admitted that our Chhata con esponds to the limita of the traditional formulas, it would lead as to the paradoxical conclusion that the operation whiab in sowhore wanting in the known protocol is the only one of which there is no traco in our own inscription, and on the other hand that the only operation which is common to our four doodmonta in just the only one unknown to the later redactions. What would be a conjosture, though yory probable to

[VOL. VII. 
mer mind, is raised to a certainty by Någik No. 5, where we read chato lekho. Chhata world will be corregnond to loshata from the root kshan. It is quite true that kshar ordinarily means only to hizt;' but this meaning rests on the primary signification to hollow out,' which is also attested for the fom War and is altogether quite analogous to the primary and essential meaning OL otkih, The is the word Iakit, consecrated as it is by old custom, replaced in our texts br this equivalent I have no means to explain this ; but the fact cannot be denied, I think I can at least quove Cases there hianati is employed eus an equivalent of likhati with reference to the engraving OT timer anitta : see the inscription of Madanapala in the J. As. Soc. Berg, 1900, p. 73. I do not renture to assert that our cillata is only a graphical variant of khata kharritur. At any rate, the close relation which exists between the two roots Kilian and kshari l'enders this explanation possible. 
The characters which follow chlato, namely vijayathasattire, are perfectly certain, except that the th may be accompanied by an e, and except the last letter, which I would dccicledly read kilu because of the curve at the bottom, is the hook at the top were a little more rounded. As it 18, the maging the seems to me just as possible as the reading re. Is it at all probable that, as Buihior thought (n. 112, note, and compare p. 105, note), we have liere a triple error of the scribe for ziluvakhali Jellideåre This clesignation of the residence of a king is indeed well-knowll; but, putting aside the fact that such a conjecture is a little violent, one would wonder that such & Camp is here, contrary to usage and to what we find in Nasik No. 4, not determined by any topographical naine. Should we look for such a name in the very indistinct characters following datop As may be seen, they are far too doubtful to guide us by themselves; but a priori the interposl tion of dato between vijayakhandhivúre and tho namo of the locality, whatever it could be, l'enders that hypothesis very puspicious. 
If we stick to the apparent reading vijayathe satákhe (or Ore), we are again obliged to embark on an ocean of conjectures fertile in shipwrecks. Here two ocmparisons suggest them selves, which are curious, but at the same time perhaps not very safe. Satúre (or perhaps adtare) reminds of the well-known town and district of Satârâ on the south of Kårlê. It is true that the namo Sätårê has not yet been discovered in any document of ancient date (Bumbay Gazelteer, Vol. XIX. p. 224); but this may be simply acoidental. Besides, it is not very probable- Wlinta fer the original form of the name may be that it should have already assumed the form Satara in the time to which our inscriptions carry us back. At least it ought to have begun with 8dta, whatever this means, and Stålhyd as the designation of a town whose name commences with Sata' vould not be without analogios. On the other hand vijayathe, i.e., without doubt, vijayarthe, í situated in my territory' or 'in the province called Vijaya,' reminds of the name of Vaijayanti, which we have already found applied to the town that has since received the name Banayasi. xin which occurs again in Násik No. 4. The very peculiar manner in which this inscription introduces the word sendye suggests that we might have here & name given by virtue of a rocent conquest to these southern territories, where the distriot of Satârå occupies an intermerliste position between Kårlê and Banayisi. If this conjecture bad any foundation, we should feel inolined to attiibute this grant not to Visishthipatia Pulumâyi, but to Gautamiputra Satakarni. to whose reign Násik No. 4 belongs. Of course I am aware of the fragility of this assumption As for the characters following dato, the reading therand is, with reference to the two lagt lottery as improbable as the evidently desperate analysis of the word, which Bühler suggested. The first letter might be the, but could also be ve, The comparison of Nâsik No. 4 suggests Benites kafa or Bena kataká ; but the place which dato occupies does not lead us to expect a topographical name, and I may add that the remaining traces would be little favourable to this restoration 
The figure '4 ' of the number · 14 ' is hardly possible; I would rather think of a 
lot in fact the only point which is beyond doubt, is, that the year must fall between 11' and

Sivaskanda is the governor of the district; in Nasik No. 4 the amutya Śivagupta writes the grant; and bore Sivaskandagupta engraves the document on copper. The simultaueous occur rence of names into the composition of which Vishņu enters prevents us from drawing from this fact hasty conclusions regarding the state of the sects in this region. Could these resemblances ht the result of relationship? 
I must not fail to recall the link which seems to cuect this inscription with No. 13, to the commentary of which the reader is referred. I will only add that, renewed by a royal personage, the grant of the village of Karajaka was necessarily accompanied by fiscal and administrative privileges which, in spite of his high connections, Rishabhadatta had been doubtlessly unable to confer.

1 Together with the proofs of this article, I received from Dr. Hultzsch a proof of his paper on the newly discovered Kondamudi plates (above, Vol. VI. No. 31), which throw fresh light on some doubtful points in Kårld No. 19. In pointing out several of these corrections, Dr. Hultzsch has quoted my present article. It is conse quently too late to modify my remarks, and it will be enough at present to draw attention to the principal correc tions which the new plates suggeat.(1) The reading oyapipehi, iostead of deya pepehi ; (2) the explanation of this verb, as well as of pariharshi and nibadhapahis not as 1st singular aorist (with alteration of final hi into 
Him), but as 2nd singular imperative. (3) The proposed interpretation of vijayathasaidkhe ought aurely to be given up; but I do not consider the general meaning attributod to the phrase by Dr. Hultzsch as altogether satisfactory, (4) Nor do I consider his translation of chhata by signed' beyond every doabt, although the word is here accompanied by suyun. (5) The reading etansi tar in l. 25 of the Kondamudi plates suggests & similar correction for stesa[m] tu in l. 3 of Kârle No. 19. But such a correction, at least so far as the second syllable is concerned, wonld be opposed to the apparent testimony of the estuunpage. Anyhow, my forthcoming article on the Nasik inscriptions will give me an opportunity for returning to several of these difficult points.EPIGRAPHIA INDICA,

TRANSLATION, “Success! On the second-2nd-day of the third Srd-fortnight of winter in the twenty-fourth- 24th-year of king Siri-Puļumavi, son of Våsithi, this pious gift of the lay Worshipper Harapharaṇa, son of Setapharana, a Sovasaka, living in Abulåmå, (viz.) a nine celled hall, has been given to the universal Sangha, as special property of the Mahaeamgbike in honour of his parents and for securing the welfare and happiness of all beings.

As regards the proper names, I bave nothing to add to Bühler's commentazy. One can see from Fergusson and Burgess's Rock-cut Temples, p. 241, that the excavation where this inscription was found is really a hall flanked by nine cells. I have said that I would rather read parigaho than pariguhe. I am aware that an exactly similar passage which has to be compared witlı ouro, in l. 12 of the inscription of Toramâna at Kura (Ep. Ind. Vol. I. p. 240), to which I have alluded hefore (No. 13), seems to read certainly: ayan puna vihárasyöpalarana chaturdise bhiks7220 nainghê parigrahé dchárryamahasdsakándin. Whatever the true reading may be, only one interpre tation of the general sense is to my opinion possible. That of Bühler is not acceptable. He took parigraha to mean 'circle, group, and took the adherents of the school of the Mahasanghikas to be opposed to the cháturdisa bhikshusangha, though in his commentary on the Kura inscription ho recognised that parigraha can only mean' possession, property,' and that the 'universal Sangha * can only be understood in antithesis to the special seot of the Mahânâmghikas. We have already seen that certain grants seem to stipulate that gifts attributed to partionlar sects should be meant tor monks of every origin and of every denomination without distinction, compare No. 13, 1. 4. Whether we take, as basis, the nominative in translating " has been given as property of the Nahásånghikas," or the locative in rendering " has been given into the possession of the Maha sárghikas," both versions come to the same. We shall find a very similar sentence repeated twice in Násik No. 3. I shall there return to this subject, because the two groups of passages scena to explain each other, 
With ekavise the obscurities begin. Bübler bas clearly thrown the haft after the blade * still it is easier to condemn his evidently provisional attempt at interpretation than to replace it by a more probable one. I do not pretend to solve the difficulty, but would submit some observations with the desire that they may be of service to some more fortunate interpreter. The difficulty consists chiefly in two points: the word which I transcribe saheta, and the four last charaoters which are read pdpho ano. As regards saha- (the e, as I have said, is not sure), one feels tempted (considering that many other inscriptions at the end of a grant introduce the dependente of the chief donor as having joined him in the donation) to expect an enumeration of relatives taking part in the pions work of Harapharana. But the characters wbich separate ha from Budharahhitena do not furnish the epithet of relationship which that hypothesis would require and with the exception of the vowels the reading, especially of the three last letters, seems quite

Apparentl; to the man dupa whose donation is mentioned before. With Urdhurukliitueu a le'w sentence must begin: it would be contrary to all the habits of the style (f these epiginply that ile ulijtet of the donation, before being mentioned, should be enveloped in such long circumircuti 1. Perhapus wo should see clearer if this object were well defined, which uvfortunately it is mut. I have neste it elsewhere ouly in a single case at Kudâ (No. 31 of CTI, aul No. 28 of AS.), while ne seem to read patho clcyo. If any point is certain, it is that there as well ay here the cloutnl the is excluded. This circumstancc alone would suffice to conlemu the translatiou Lage,' propanel by Bhagwanlal and adopted, without conviction, by Bühler'. I have no more probable cunjeclun to substitute for it. Whatever the meaning is, we seem to be confionted liy the same term at Kndâ and here. Now, at Kuqa the part of the gentence in question begins with the characters salu, which seem to bo followed immediately by the characters tavu at the begiuuing of th:ixxt liue Neiller the testimony of the editors nor the fac-similes enable us to decide whether thu break between the second su and the initial på of patho is real or only appaient. In any case, one cannot help comparing this instance with our suhata or saheta, and consequently asking whether here also this word opens' tlie sentence of which půdho is the gulijcet, while kadins sanvachare nithito vould refer only to mandupo. I have stated why a priori a full stop neems to be indicated before Budharakiitasa; without being absolute, this objection seems to me inuoli stronger than the coincidence which I have just quoted against it, and which is extreniely Tague and perhaps altogether illusory. Another doubtful poiot has to be referred to. Between the letter Which Bühler tianscribes , while I read sya in accordance with Bhagwanlal, and the pá (f pusi kuya, there is room for three characters; but the previous editora rcad -imply te nithout ndnitting a break. They soem to interpret thus the charactor which follows the group aya. Hence they must have assumed that the distinct traces immediately before pâ are not the remains of a letter, probably of an w, but accidental flaws in the stone. An inspection of the original could alons decide if another character has disappeared. The distance betiyeen the letters certainly suggests this, and it is a priori probable that the title updsikit, attributed to Badbarakhita's mother, shonki be accompanied by bor name as in other cases, Thus I incline towards beliering that the letter which comes after sydu, and which may be d or 16, formed the first syllable of this name, the secon syllable of which is lost in the break, and that the traces which follow represent the initiale of apásikel.

DEV ULAPALLI PLATES OF IMMADI-NRISIM HA.

The language of the inscription is Sanskrit poetry, with the exception of a femr Turls in Sanskrit prose in lines 1 and 77 f., and the alphabet is Nagari of the Vijayanagara type.' The very last word, śri-Rúnachandra (1. 78), which stands for the signature, is in Telngai 
characters. 
The inscription records that Immaţi-Nrisimha (1l. 39 and 46 f.), son cf Nộiaimharaya (ll. 22 f, and 46), glanted to a Brâhmana the village of Lêvulapalli 11, 67 f.) in the Märjavânda siman? (1. 65) of the Penugonda-mahârâjya: (1. 64). Dêvulapalli, which is illentical with the modern village of that name in the Vâralpâdu tâluka of the Cuddapah district, ic waisl, in the ingcription, to have been situated within the limits of the village of Gundluru* (1. Cl. south-eagt of Surinayani-Mushtûru (1. 66), and north of Adavi-Mushtūru (1. 671. 11. Krishnasvami Nayudu informs me that Sûrinảyani-Mushtūru is now called Errakotapalli in the public accounts, while popularly it is known as Mushtūru without any prefis, anul that Adavi-Mushtûru is now known as Kôna, though it is sometimes called also Köna-Mushtūru. Ile also tells me that Dêvulapalli is no longer an agraleru. 
The plates have been borrowed from Dêvulapalli Venkataramanappa, who is saill to be r lineal descendant of the donee. It is said that the original name of the family was Vyilapilis that it was given up in favour of Bollapini, which, in course of time, became corrupted into Gollapini, and that finally the family adopted the name of Dévulapalli, which is the name of the village where it is living to this day. 
The occasion for the grant was a lunar eclipse which occurred on Sunday, the full-moon lithi of Bhadrapada in the cyclic year Raktákshin and Saka-Samvat 1427 (in numerical wonds) (v. 32 f.). This date corresponds to Sunday, the 25th August A.D. 1504, on which day there was a lunar eclipse.6 
Historically the inscription is of great value, as it relates to a line of chiefs who exercised considerable authority on the east coast of Southern India in the 15th century of the Christian era, and one of whom, the donor's father Nrisimharaya, was the principal actor in the drama which involved the overthrow of the. first dynasty of the Karnâţa or Vijayanagara empire. Little or nothing has been hitherto published concerning these chiefs, whom I would cell Såļuval chiefs. 
I have compiled the following genealogy from the information furnished by this inscription and by the Telugu poems Jaimini-Bhdrutan and Varihapuranan. The former book was dedicated to Immadi-Nrisimha's father Nsisira hargya, also called Narasingariya, and the latter to Nrisimh harya's general Narasimha of the Tuļu family, who afterwards became the founder of one of the dynasties of the Vijayanagara empire. The Jaimini-Bharatan has been printed, and my refer ences are to the Madras edition of 1893. The Varáhapuránam has not been printed, but manu script copies of it are extant.

The Vardhapurunan 82 names of only those persons who are in the lirect line of descent, and the nanies of the cold are taken from the Jaimini-Dharatanz and the inscription. The Salura family traces its cies from Yadu and is hence called Yadava-vams. The carliest historical person mentioned Vankidêva, who is referred to in the Tarihapurúnan only. Vanki's son was Gunda.2 cui had six sons, of whom Mungu or Saluva-dlanguwas the greatest. The Jainine-Dlucinatan 13 very eloquent in its pinises of this peraon and says that, among other things, be gained succe for Sämparaya in his battles with the “ Sultan of the South " and thereby earned the title - the establisher of Såmparasa," that he fuuuled (the teinple of) the god Sriranga and gave sixty thousand ocidas (half-pagodas) for the expenses of the temple, and that he killed (in battle) the “Sultan of Dadhurâ."6 
In the temple at Simhảchalan in the Vizagapatam district there is an ingcription datea 1 the Saka year 1350. It records that Telunguraya, sou of Samburaya of Kaunada-daśa, deli vered into the possession of two shepherds one hundred cows for the maintenance of two peine Ntual lights (akhanda-dipa) in the temple, and that he gave the shepherds putte of land in the village Vaddadi in lieu of wages. Thire is another inscription of Telangurây, also dated in the Saka year 1330, at Santaxavůru in the Binatla tilaka of the Kistna diatrict, in whioh tle king is described as the "Waheimandalaswara Misaraganda Kathâri Sâļuva Teluñguraya." Rao Bahadur K. Virosalingam Pantulugaru quotes a verse of the poet Srinatha who lived about this time), in which the poet laments the death of acreral of his patrons including Tulungurâya and there is another verse which is attributed to tho same poet and which ends in the words Súmpuráyani Tolurigit nilu dirgh-ayum=auti : "O_Teluiga, (son) of Sâmaparága! May you be blessed with long life !" There seems no doubt that the king or piuce Teluogu mentioned in the above-quoted insoriptions was one and the same, and if his father Sámpara ya ulias Samburiya is identical with the Sîmparaya of the Juimini_Bharatan, he would appear to have belonged to the same Såluva family as llanga“ apparently to a senior branch of it. It would appear also that the sovereiguty, which was originally in the senior branch of the family, subsequently passed on to the junior branch to which Mangu belonged, though we do not know at presont how and when this change took place. The “Sultân of the South " Tho pas at war with Samard ya Tas, no doubt, the Bahmani king, and by the "Sultan of Madhura” pre should, I think, understand the Páydya king,* the temple of Suîrangam which Mangu built is evidently the celebrated temple in Srirangapattana in the Mysore conutry. 
Mlangu had sis sous, of whom one was Gauta, who had four song : Gunda,lo Saluva, Boppa and Tippe.

From all accounts Nrisimhara ya appears to have been a very powerful grince. I th: according to Ferishta and the author of the Burhud22-vji Afa'ásir he was the most pxwerful prinie ili all Karnata and Telingana and owned extensive territories on the east coast right up to Maruli watam. According to the latter authority Nrisimharåya was constantly at war with the Bahmani-king Muhammad II. They met first at Rajamahendri, “on the further side of which the infidel Narasim haraya with 700,000 cursed infantry and 500 elephauts like mountains of iron had taken his stand." No battle took place, however, as Nrisiriharaya is said to have taken to flight on the arrival of the Sultan's army. This was probably in the year 1479 A.1). Noxt year they seem to have met again at Kondaviều, the people of which, " throwing themselves ati thar protection of Narasinharya, bad altogether withdiawn from thoir allegiance to the male (if Islam.” After quelling this rebellion, the Sultan marched against the kingdom of Nộisimhnråtek, because " the destruction of the infidels was an object mach to be desired : and as the intur! Narasimha who, owiug to his minorous army and the extent of his dominions, was the gutøtext and most powerful of all the rulers of Telingana and Vijayanagar, had latterly sharu delay and remissness iu proving his sincerity towards the royal court by sending presents and mud-Loshaji (money given to foreign troops to abstain from plunder and devastation).' The Sultan Imid kiego to the furt of Mâlûr (in the Mysore territory), “ the greatest vf the forts of that country','' and was ultimately bought off with valuable presents of jewellery and other valuables, elephants and horses, and with a confession by Nrisimhariya of his weakness and a promise of obedience and submission. This did pot, however, prevent the Sultan from straightway marching against Káãohi, “situatod in the centre of the dominions of that malignant one" (Nrisijuharaya), and sucking the town and temples "which were the wonder of the age." 
We shall now turn to the Hivdû accounts of the same periode The Jaimina-Bharatani gives Nrisimbariya credit for having vanquished the kings of the Tigular (or Tamil) and Oddi (or Oliaga) conntries and for having conquered the farts of Kapåladarga, Penugonga, Bonagiri, Choiji, and Kommadharðpura. In another part of the Jaimini-Bharatam: we are told that Nrisimharaya" dic rated the golden palaces (temples ?) of Kiãohi, Venkata (Tirupati, and Kålahasti with the precious stones annually given as tribute by the kinga of Páñchala, Dravida, Anga, MÅlasa, Saka and Pracjrôtisha.'lo This is, of course, hyperbolical, but shows that the three important places of pilgrimago referred to were in the dopinions of Yfisiv bariya.

princes et other. It woulcruata empire, since closely tallies he first dynasty 
According to the Furihapurinam Nộisiniharaya's first general išvara of the Tuļu family conquered the forts of (1) Udayadri, (2) Huttari, (3) Gaņņikôţa, (4) Penogonda (5) Beggulůrni, (6) Kövela-Nellûra, (7) Kundani, (8) Goduguchinta, (9) Bagûru, (10) Naragonda, (11) Amûru and (12) Srirangapattanam, and “destroyed the cavalry of the Yavanas of Boda dakota at Gandikota.") The Yavanas referred to here are the Bahmani kings, who transferred their capital from Kulbarga to Bidar in Jane 1423 A.D., during the reign of Aḥmad Shah.? Referring to the same event, the author of the Telugu poem Pärijatúpa harapan says ihat Isvara "gave rise to thousands of rivers of blood by killing the horses of the Yavanas of Bedandakota,''but he transfers the scene to Kandukuru.4 The Muhammadan historians do not, of course, refer to this event. 
Nộisimlarâya's dominions were extensive, and they probably comprised the whole of the modern districts of North Arcot, Chinglepat and Nellore, and portions at least of South Arcot, Cuddapah, Kistoa and Mysore. The Vardhapurdnan calls Nrisin haraya - the possessor of arms which are capable of protecting the kingdom of Karnata,"i which shows his connection with that kingdom. According to the same work he was one of the Sunrantas or tributary princes of the Karnata empire, and both Isvara and his son Narasimha were his generals one after the other. It would appear also that Nrisimharaya was probably related to the kings of the first dynasty of the Karạâta empire, since both claimed to belong to the Yâdava line of the lunar race of Kshatriyas. This description closely tallies with that given by the Portuguese chronicler Ferrão Naniz of "Narsyngua" who overthrew the first dynasty of the empire. In fact according to Nuniz there was a doable usurpation of the Vijayanagara throne about this time, the first usurpation being by “ Narsymgua," whom I identify with Saļuya Nrisimharaya, father of Immadi-Nrisimha, the donor of the present grant, and the second by Nrisiṁharya's general "Narsenaque" or Narasimha, the founder of the Tuļuva dynasty. 
According to Nuniz, the following are briefly the ciroumstances that led to the downfall of the first and the accession of the second dynasty. The last great king of the first dynasty pas Dévardya II., who ruled till about the year A.D. 1449. The next forty or fifty years saw no less than five sovereigns, all of thiom weak and imbecile. The last of them, w hom Nudiz calls “ Padea R&o," seems to bave been the worst of the lot, and in his time the empire deolived even more than in the time of his four immediate predecessors. It occurred to Nrisinbarůya, who was the principal minister and general of the state, that a change of sovereign was necessary to prevent the kingdom from falling an easy prey to its hereditary enemy, the Bahmani king, and, with the coasent and support of the other generals and ministers, he seized the throne and kingdom, allowing the king to make his escape. Nộisimharay& died, leaving two infant sons and a general named “Narsepaque" or Naraga-Nayaka, in whom he had much confidence and whom he therefore appointed regent during the minority of his sons. In a short time Nrisim haråya's eldest son was murdered by one of Narasa-Nayaka's enemies, who wanted it to be believed that Narasa-Nayaka murdered the boy for the sake of his crown. Subsequently the second prince was murdered at the instance of Naras&-Nayaka bimself, who thorenpon

proclaimed himself king. Narasa-Nayaka was succeeded by his son “ Bushal Ray," wlu diw! after a reign of six years and was succecded by bis younger brother Krishņadevaráya. 
Nuniz expressly states that Narasa-Nayaka was the father of Krishpaddvarára azul alımı " Busbal Rau " was his eldest son and successor, Narasa-Nayaka minst therefore le identitiei with Narasimha, the founder of the second dynasty, and "Busbal Rao" with his eldest fulls Vira-Narasimha. Mr. Sewell finds this account confusing and conflicting with kuuwa ince This is because he identifies “ Nargymgua," the first usurper, with Narasimha, the fouuder of the Tuluva dynasty, which leads him to the conclusions that his successor Nalaga-Nåjaka, wkom bit identides with Viva-Narasimha, was not his son, and that between Vira-Narasimha and Krishya dövara ya there was an intermediate king conclusions which are certainly opposed to pres statements contained in several inscriptions and books. 
These difficulties wonld vanish entirely if we admit the theory of double usurpation aul identify Naraga-Nayaka with the founder of the Tuļuva dynasty. The theory of double unur. pation is not only not inconsistent with known facts, but is highly probable, since but for the first usurpation Narasimba would have had no locus standi in the affairs of the empire and ourtainly no opportunities or excuse for usurping the throne. The statement in the inscription that Nrisimharaya with the aid of his sword defeated all and became a Súrrabhauna or emperor (v. 13) seems to me to point unmistakably to his nusurpation of the Karnata throne. 
The account of Nuniz as to the nature of the relationship which existed between Saluva Nrisimharaya and Narasimha is directly and fully corroborated by the hardhapuranam. Thie first chapter (úsvúsa) of the book gives the genealogy of both those persons and says thar Narasimha'& father Isyara, who is also called Isvala-Nayala, was Nrisimharânya's general, and that he was succeeded by his son in that office. In another place Narasimha is said to have been honoured by Nrisiriharaya and appointed commander of his forcea,* and in a third place he is described as the supporter of the kingdom of Nrisimharảya,"5 Iu the penultimate verse of the sixth a budsa he is addressed as satuva-Narasinga-dharadhara-dangandtha, .6. commander of the forces of king Saluva-Nrisimharaya, 
There are at present no means of fixing the exact year in which Nộisimharêya usurped the Vijayanagara throne ; but this event must be placed between the Saka year 1408(A.D. 1486-87!, 
A.D. whioh is the latest known date of the first dynasty, and the Saka year 1418, Rakshasa ( 1495-96), which is the earliest known reliable date of Immadi-Nrisimharaya.? That the latter Was recognised as king of Vijayanagara, at least in name, is oxpressly stated by Naniz, and Dr. Hultzach informs me that an inscription at Bårukûr (No. 166 of 19011 of Saka-Sanval 1421, Siddharthin = A.D. 1499-1500), states that in this year the Mahdinand lásvara Médinimisaraganda Kathari Säluva lmmadi-Narasimharårs-mahir&f& Was ruling at

Vijayanagara, and that his chief minister was Narasa[n]ņa-Nayaka. This Naraganna-Nayaka may be identical with the founder of the Tuluva dynasty and the “Nargquaque" of Nuviz. If this identification is correct, Narasimha's usurpation of the throne of Nrisimliarîye, or rather of his sou and successor Inmadi-Nrisimhariya, cannot have taken place earlier than AD. 1499.1500. 
Mr. Sewell quotes five inscriptions of “Narasińharaya of Vijayanagara' appertaining to years prior to A.D. 1500.* One of these inscriptions was dated in 1451, one in 14€9, and one iu 1471. It is clear that these three inscriptions cannot be referred to the founder of the Talava dynasty, as they came into existence long before lie could have become king of Vijayanagara inccording to any account. The last of the five iusciiptions belongs to Sâlura Immadi-Nrisin baru sou of Nrisim haraya The remainivg in£cription is to be found at Conjeeyeram, and it is pos sible that, when examined, it will be found to belong to the time of Saluva-Nrisiin harîya. 
Ag Dr. Hultzach informs me, a Bå ukür inscription (No. 152 of 1901) of the Maharutjie bliraju Rajuparamétrara Virapratâ pa Vira-Narasimharaya of Vijayanagara is dated iu Saka-Samvat 1424, Durnati (A.D. 1501-02). This date suggests that Immadi-Nrisimharaya was ousted by Narasiriihx (or by his son Vita-Nazasimha ?) between A.D. 1499 and 1502. In accordance with this fact the gubjoined copper-plate inscription of A.D. 1504 does not reprosent him any more as a king of Vijayanagara, but as the ruler of the province of Penugopậa.

ABRIDGED TRANSLATION. The first three verses are in praise of Vighnêsvara, the boar-incarnation of Vishnu, and the goddess of the Earth. 
(Verse 4 f.) From that glorious flower of the waters (the Moon), which perfumes (illumines) the whole space, (and) which Siva always wears on (his) head with great solicitude, was produced Budhar, (and) from him the renowned Pururavas. Several kings were afterwards born (in that family) in course of time. 
(V. 6.) In the milk-ocean of this family was born the virtuous king Gunda (I.), like a second Pdrijata (tree), though (he became) an Apdriját al (by conquering his enemies). 
(V.74.) To him were born the virtuous Gunda (II.)-Bomma, the glorious Madiraja of great fame, Gautaya (I.) whose high fame was sung (by all), the heroic and glorious Virahon bala, prince Savitri-Mangi, and king saluva-Mangi-(like) a second set of six emparors. 
(.9.) Most famous of these was king saluva-Mangi, a Mahendra on earth, who van quished a hero foremost in battle and seized the dagger (kathdrild) from his hand. 19

(V. 10.) To him was born the renowned king Gauta (II.), the unblemished moon of who; fame, born in the fresh ocean (created by the waters (poured out on the occasion of his zifts, always liitened the three worlds. 
(V. 11.) To huo was born, even as delicions fragrance out of a fresh blossom, the virtuou king Gunda (III.), irho won the goddess of victory by churning the ocean of (his) enemies' force with the Mandara (nioritain) of (his) arn. 
(Vv. 12-20.) By the grace of the god Nộisiraha of Ahôbala, this lord Guņda (III.), th Xt'au of good qualities, begot on (his wife) Mallámbika Nrisimharaya of great fame, wh 12 29908sed the titles of Misaraganda, Kathåri, Saluva (i.e. 'the hawk') and Dharaṇivarába who, aided only by (lois) Stord, defeated all (his enemies) and became an emperor (Süroabhauna); ylio became Dharâvarâha (i.e. the boar of the earth') by saving (uplifting) the earth fron the ocean of wicked (kings), and Såļuva by smiting the crowd of (his) enemies like (a flight of lairds ;s whose title Barbarabaha became full of meaning, because his powerful arm (hand) hal bx-come rough through the killing of enemies and the making of gifts to the needy ;t who by suinquering (excelling in making gifts) the five divine trees with the fingers of (his) hand (and ringing the bell five times (291 celebration of the five-fold victory) became Pascbaghantâninâda ; who obtained the title of Aivaraganda by conquering (Bacelling) the five Pândavas in truthful ress, strength, archery, personal beauty and intelligence (respectively); who, wielding the weapon 
came Mûrurânyaraganda7 by making through his valour the three kings of Châra, Choral and Pandya afraid on the battle-field ; who obtained the title Urvaråditya by dispelling the thick Jarkness(luis) enemies by the sunshine of (his) valour (and thereby) illuminating this earth Fund) who was Hari (Vishộu) in reality by virtue of his litles Chauhattamalla, Dharani. varaha, Chalukya-Narayanalo and Môhana-Murari. 
(V. 21 f.) His queen was the virtuous Srirangamâmbâ, even as Ramî of Hari.

(V. 23.) What are gifts of agrahāras to this chief of benefactors, who gave complete neck laces (sumagra-hára)? What is the use of many words ? What is there that could not be made it gift of by the donor of a full visvachakra and brahmanda ?12 
(V. 24.) This well-bred, glorious Immedi-Nřisimhêndra, son of Nțisimbarâya, is pros. perous on earth. 
1 This is the celebrated place of pilgrimage in the Kurnool district. * This is an evident reference to Nrisimlar, ya's tisurpation of Vijaysdagara. 
& Tho tradition is that the title was due to the fact of Krisimhariya's ancestors having acted as fowlers to the kings of Karnataka 
There is a pun in the original on the word ddnd, which means cutting' gud also's gift. 
This etymology is funciful. Paizohaghantanindda is apparently the same as Paichamaħriabda. 
6 Another graceful etymology. The meaning of divaraganda is the lord of five (chiefs),' a title which Nrisimharaya seems to have borrowed from the Vijaya'iagara kings. 
* This title also was borrowed from the Vijayanagara kings, 8 Chara stands for Chéra, and Chóra for Olifa. 
9 In this sense the word is a corruption of chatur-hasta-malla. Another derivation is from chatur hasti-malla, which means 'a hero baving the atreogth of four elephants.' 
10 This is an anschronism, 11 Here is a play on the word immadi, which means the second' s well 88 * double.'

No. 9.--KAHLA PLATE OF THE KALACHURI SODHADEVA; 
[VIKRAMA-]SAMVAT 1134. 
By F. KIELHORN, P.D., LL.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN, This plate was found on the 15th August 1889 by the cultivator Shiusewak Rai iu his field at Kahla, a village in the tappa Athaisi of the pargana Dhuriâpâr of the Görâkhpur district in the United Provinces, and presented by Dr. W. Hoey to the Provincial Museum of Lucknow in January 1895, I edit the inscription which it contains from impressions, kindly furnished to Dr. Hultzsch by the late Mr. E. W. Smith. 
This is a single copper-plate which, to judge from the impressions, is about 1' 51" broai] by l' " high, and is inscribed on both sides. In the middle of the lower part of it there is a ring-hole, 18" in diameter, and together with the impressions of the plate I have received in pressions of a circular seal, about 3" in diameter, which contains in high relief the figure et & bull, lying down and facing to the proper right; below it, the'legend śrîmat-Sodhndévasya, in Någari letters about " high; and below this again, an arrow pointing to the proper right. An arrow is engraved also on the second side of the plate, in line 59, before the words sva-hasto: yań. In general, both the writer and the engraver have done their work carefully. The wri ting on the second side of the plate is well preserved, but that on the first side has suffored from corrosion so that in several places, which will be pointed out in the notes, the reading of the text is doubtful. Fortunately, with a single exception in line 28, the names and dates may be giver with absoluto certainty. The size of the letters is about ". The characters are those of the Någari alphabet of the time and locality to which the inscription belongs; they resemble those of the copper-plates of Gôvindachandrs and Jayachchandra of Kanauj. Jo lines 48-50 they farnish signs for the fractions 1 and 1, which I have not met with in other northern inscriptions : 1) is denoted by the figure for 1 with two vertical lines after it, and the fraction by the circle for nought followed by three vertical lines. The sign of avagraha occurs once, in sampradattu Somabhiḥ, 1. 47. The language in Sanskrit, bat the names of some of the Brahmans mentioned in lines 40-50 are given in their vernacular forms or in forms based on them. Lines 1-32 contain 
1 This is evidently the modern village of Vayalpådu.

I was informed by Mr. Gholam Rasool Beg, Head Draftsman of the Archæolcgical Survey, United Provinces, that the village Kahla is on the (idråkhpur to Azamgarh metalled road, about 28 miles from the former towa; but I have not found the name in the Indian Atlas, sheet No. 102, which gives · Dhooreapar. in loux, 88° 18', lat. 26° 25'..- Mr. Gbolam Rasool Beg has kindly furáisbed me with two very good additional impressions of the Kahls plate.

The rest of the text is in prose. Unusual terms which occur in the latter will be drawn attention to below. As regards ortowe graphy, the sign for v throughout serves for both v and b; the dental sibilant is frequently em ployed for the palatal; the palatal for the dental in abit, 11. 3, 5, 7 and 22, ajafram. 1. 16, sasana (for säsana), 1. 22, and sahasra, l. 53; for the palatal sibilant preceded by anusvára we have no in vanec, 11, 6 and 50, vansya, l. 3, vinsati, 1. 37, and trinsat, l. 39; j is aged instead of y in Krita tirjja, 1. 3, Karttavirijo, I. 4, and ját, . 23; gh instead of h in Naghuishah, 1, 2, and singhdsand, 1. 13; and imra and tomra are spelt åmura and tamura, 11. 38 and 57. 
The inscription belongs to a hitherto unknown branch of the Kalachuri family. It records a grant of land by the Paramabhaftáraka Maharajadhiraja Paramétvara, the devout worshipper of Mahåśvara (Siva), the glorious Sôdhadova, who meditated on the feet of the P. M. P., the glorious Maryaddsågaradêva (1. 33). The introductory verses give an account of Sodhadêya's ancestors, 
After the words in saste, verses 1-4 enlogize the following mythical and legendary beings : the Moon who was Atri's son, Budba, Purúravas, Nabusha, Haihaya, Kritavirya, and Kärtavirya Arjuna. In the family descended from the last there was a personage who by con quering Ayðmukha and subduing the Krathas possessed himself of Kalañiara (v. 5). This ornament of the Kalachuris, after having conquered his enemies, gave the kingdom to his younger brother, and the latter, Lakshmaparaja, in turn conquered švētapadas (v. 6). In Lakshmanarâja's family there was the king Rajaputra, who captured the lord of horses Váhali (or Bâhali), defeated the kings of the east, and lowered the fame of Kiritin and other princes (v. 7). From him sprang Bivardja (7.), and his son was Šamkaragaņa (I.) (v. 8). His son again was Guņambhôdhidôva (Guņasågara [I].), who had some dealings with a Bh ôjadevas and by & warlike expedition took away the fortune of the Gauda (v: 9). From his first wife Kanchana dévi this king had a son named Ullabba who, after reigning himself, placed on the throne his brother Bhâmânadêva (a son of Gurasagara from another wife named Madana. dévi), who had distinguished himself in a war with a ling of Dhårå (vv. 10-15). Bhâmâna's son from Dahattadôvi was Samkaragana [II.] Mugdhatunga (vv. 16 and 17); his son from the queen Vidyå was Guñasångara [I.] (vv. 18 and 19); his son from Rajavâ was Sivargja (11.) Bhêmâna (vy. 20-22); his son from Sûgalladavi was Sankaragana (III.) (v. 23), and hia son from Yašôlékhyadevi was Bhima (v. 24). The inscription then, after stating that Bhima by the decree of fate lost his kingdom (or was dethroned), records that the king Gunar gågara (II.) hed by Layanyavati & son named Vyåse and that this Vyâseb if I understand the text rightly-Was. raised to the throne, when the (royal) oamp was at Gôkulaghatta, on Monday, the day of the eighth tithi in the bright half of the second Jyaishtha of the your 1087 (given in words, v. 27). Vyåsa's son was the king Sôdhadova, who in v. 30) is described as the life of Sarayûpêra (or the bank of the Sarayü'), and who is the donor of this grant. Since, ss has been already stated, Soghadêya is represented as meditating on the feet of 
Kalachurik, aite Lakshmaņaraja, na, who captured their and other his son 
Compare Ep. Ind. Vol. II. p. 5, and other inscriptions of the Kalachuria of Chedi (or Dåbila). 
* I do not know the legend here referred to. Ayomukh is the name of a demon and of & mountain, Kratko At the naine of a 1%ce or people. The well-known mountain or fort of Kalañjars was taken from the (Kalachari) 
kinge of Chedi by the Chandöllas, who from it took the title Kalaharddhipati; but the Kalachuryas of the South, Ht any rate, kept the hereditary title of lords of Kålsäjara, the best of town. 
This mitti be the name of a country, but the name has not yet been foand elsewhere. 
The compound of which this name forms part ia somewhat ambiguous. The Bhöjaddys referred to may be Bhojadera of Kanaaj (Be my List of North, Inscr. No. 14). 
In line 38 of the text there seem to be references to a person named Sasva(P), but the text is damaged in that line, and the sense is not clear to maNo. 9.]

The adjectives derived from the names of the places of residence ur Orivin of the donees are Kataughanagrâmiya (from Kataughanagréma), Kahalliye (from Kahali). Kulândhiya (from Kulåndh[1] ), Tikarikiya (from Tikari), Talikdya (from Tali), Nagara from Nagara), Nikhatigrâmiya (from Nikhatigrama), Mahualikiya (from Mabudli), Matheus (from Mathura), Sâo kasasthåniya (from Sankasastbåna), and Hastigriniya (from Bastia gráma).

and the inscription ends with the words : Sthis is the own hand of the Muhárajadhiraja, the glorious Sodhadêva.' 
I regret to say that I have not been able to identify with confidence any of the numerous localities mentioned in this inscription. The river Gandaki in which the king had bathod when making his donation must be the Gandak or Little Gandak of the United Provinces ; but I have not found on their banka any name like Dhuliâgbatta. The Sarayû after which Sõąhadêva's territory appears to have been called Sarayüpâral most probably is the river Gogra, Thich in Oudh is known by the names Deoha, Surioo or Sarayu, as well as Ghogra." The rivers would indicate in a general way where the Guņakala-Vishaya and (the district of) Tikarikå, in which the villages containing the land granted were situated, should be looked for. 
Of the three dates which the inscription contains, the date on which the grant was made regularly corresponds, for Vikraxaa-Saṁvat 1134 expired, to Sunday, the 24th December A.D. 1077, when the 7th tithi of the bright half of Pausha ended 17 h. 21 m., and the Uttarayana samkranti took place 5 h. 35 m., after mean sunrise. And the date on which the grant was written regularly corresponds, for the Kârttikadi Vikrama year 1135 expired and the púrpimanta Chaitra, to Sunday, the 24th Fəbruary A.D. 1079, when the 6th tithi of the dark half of the půrnimánta Chaitra ended 21 h. 42 m. after mean sunrise. From this it may be seen that the giant was written as much as fourteen months after the making of the donation. The date given in lines 28 and 29 for the accession of Sôąhadêva's father Vyasa must fall in the Karttikadi Vikrama year 1087 expired, because of the three years which might be denoted by the number 1187 that year alone contained an intercalary Jyaishtha; and for the Kürttikadi Vikrama year 1087 expired the date corresponds to Monday, the 31st May A.D. 1031, when the 8th tithi of the bright half of the second Jyaishtha commenced 9 h. 47 m. after mean sunrise. It may keem somewhat remarkable that the week-day shonld have been connected here with a tithi which commenced so late in the day, but this is no reason for suspecting the authenticity of the date; the accession of Vyåsa may have taken place late in the afternoon. 
This last date, of A.D. 1031, is earlier than any date known to his from the inscriptions of the Kalachuris of Chêdi. In my opinion, it sheps that the founder of this new branch of the Kalachuri family, Rajaputra, cannot be placed later than the beginning of the 9th century A.D.

No. 10.- LUCKNOW MUSEUM PLATE OF KIRTIPALA; 
[VIKRAMA-]SAMVAT 1167. 
By F. KIELHORN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN. This plate was brought by a tepant to a fair at Bhatpar in the Görå kbpur district, United Provinces, and sold as waste to a copper-smith. Dr. W. Hoey who heard of this follower up the plate to another district and, having recovered it, presented it in September 1898 to the Provincial Museum, Lucknow. I edit the inscription which it contains from excellent impressions, sent to Dr. Haltzsch by the late Mr. E. W. Smith. 
, This is a single copper-plate which measures about 114" broad by l' high, not including a semicircular projection1%, which rises from the middle of tho top and is about 4" broad and 3** high. On the front side of this projection there is a neatly engraved figure of the god Vishņu

1. Similarly shaped is e.g. the Gurmha (in Gorakhpur district) plate of Joyåditya II., Jour, Bong. do. Soc. Vol. I.XX. Part I. Plate i. In the Gorakhpur grant of the time of the same prince (see my List of North. Inscr. No. 604) the projection is at the proper right side of the plate.

sliell. The wrathirds of the second sind 
. The characters ards the end of the 
in his boar incarnation, with a small figure of a woman (representing the earth) resting, as it seoms, on one of the god's arme. The god himself is represented as standing over a serpent, 10 front of which there is a flower. On the back the projection contains the engraving of a conch shell. The writing commences immediately beneath the projection and covers the whole of the first side and two-thirds of the second side of the plate. It is well preserved nearly throughout. The size of the letters is between and 1". The characters differ little from the ordinary Någari. The language is Sanskrit, but some of the names towards the end of the inscription appear in their vernacular forms or rather in forms based on them. Lines 2-12 contain sir verdes, five of which give the genealogy of the donor, and lines 21-33 contain benedictive and imprecatory verses. Of the introductory verses two (verses 2 and 6) are incorrect, Owing to carelessness ou the part of the writer or engraver the text, besides numerous minor errors, contains several corrupt passages, one or two of which I am unable to correct with confidence. In respect of orthography it may suffice to state that the letter v denotes both v and b, and that the dental sibilant is often used for the palatal. 
The inscription records a grant of land by the Paramabhattaraku Maharajadhiraja Paramésvara, the devout worshipper of Mahāśvara (Siva), the glorious Kirtipäladêva, who by inberitance had obtained the lordship over Uttarasamudra, and who meditated on the feet of tbe P.M.P., the derout worshipper of Mahôśrara (Śiva), the glorious Vikramapaladêra, who had acquired the lordship over Uttarasamudra by his own arms (11. 18-21). The document differs from other grants in this that it does not contain an order to officials and others, but simply records the fact that the king made a certain donation. 
The text, after the auspicious word fiḥ, commences with the words "this is the own hand of the glorious Kirtipåladova," words such as we ordinarily find at the end of a grant. Then follow the words om on svasti, and & verse glorifying the god Pasupati (Siya). After that, verses 2-6 give the donor's genealogy. There was a king (nripa) Bhuvanapala, an ornament of the rulers of the earth of the family of Sävarņi (Manu), descended from the Sun. His son was Vikramapala, who by his own arms acquired the sovereignty over Saumyasindhu (i.e. Uttarasamudra). And his son again was Kirtipäla. 
This Kirtăpåla, having worshipped the god Nariyana (Vishņu), in his presence, on a date pplich will be considered below, gavo two villages to the Brâhmap, the shakkura Prahasitasar man, who was born at a bhatta-village, viz, the village of Daviråmakula in the Sråvastiya vishaya, belonged to the Gautama gôtra, and was a son of the Pandita Visvarüpa and grandson of the Pandita Kólava. Both villages were in the Daradagandaki country (déta); one was the village of D[ambalüli (or perhaps Dévaüli), which belonged to (the) Sasho[ra viP]så (district), and the other the village of Vikara, belonging to (the) Shố[thâ?]visa (distriot ; 11. 12-17). 
The names of three of the localities mentioned in the preceding paragraph anfortunately are partly eo indistinct in the original that I am unable to make them out with certainty ; and I have not succeeded in identifying any of the places on the maps at my disposal. With the paggage describing the birth-place of the donee we may compare above, Vol. III. p. 357, 1. 38, Sravasti-mandané(ié) Käsilla-bhattagráma-vinirggataya;a the name Daradagandaki must be connected with the river Gandaki (the Great or Little Gandak in the United Provinces): and the names of the two districts remind one of similarly ending names of districts in the grants 
1 Compare Gupta Inscr, p. 159. In the Jour. Beng. Ås, 8oc. Vol. XVII. Part I. p. 806, Captain J. Cunningham, describing & sculptured representation of Vishnu as the bosr, at Pathårt, says: "The statnes about # feet high ; it is covered with igares disposed in ranka; it has a diminutive woman hanging by the task of the god, and the remains of a serpent may be trxced on the ground on which it is standing

Ramkola.' which occurs in the Gôråkhpur district, Indian Atlas, sheet Vis un der bag. ; } lat. 26° 54. 
The donation, in lines 15 and 16, is stated to have been made on the second date of the bright half in the month Phalguna, at a sankranti of Bțihaspati (or Jupiter), on a Satur day in the year 1167, given in words; and the same data, withont the refetallittu Jupiter position, are repeated in figures in line 40. So far as I know, in quoting & 8xxakránti of Jupiter the date is quite unique. For the Vikrama year 1167 expired it regularly o 4**]09 t'; Saturday, the l1th February A, D, 1111, when the second tithi of the bright half of thelgum sommenced 0 h. 47 m. after mean sunrise. As the true longitude of Jupitur at TEDI #unrisa * * this day by the Sarya-siddhanta was ls 0° 2.5', Jupiter had entered the siga Vrishabha 12 h.!! before mean sunrise of the given day. The resalt shews that, instead of savirg Lriepas sankrantar, the writer might have said, more accurately, Brihaspater=''rishubhan amidrantna in 6 at the time of Jupiter's entrance into the sign Vrishabha.'l 
After recording the grant, the inscription in line 21 8. has two verses containing praye* addressed to the Earth, and after that a number of benedictive and imprecatery verz. iratru duced by the words “speech of the sacrificer (or donor) after granting the land."' The Puik** are followed in lines 34-39 by the names of 17 persons, each of which has prefixed to it a title ghewing his rank or occupation or official position. Of these titles those which I do mut T210m ber to have met elsewhere are Ashtavargika, Daivágárika, Maharthasúsanika(?) and Sankhadharin Of the names themselves Anûka, Jågûka, Kosavapadumâ, Mabicbanda, Mahika. Raudhû ketika Släkhâka and Sihada? may be drawn attention to... The grant itself is alled in line *** a tämrasya pattakam ; it was caused to be engraved by the Pandita Råndhûka, and engraved kog the goldsmitih Ganêsvara (11. 39 and 40). 
I have not found hitherto any reference to the kings or chiefs of Uttarasamudrs and are anable to locate their principality. Apparently it must have been somewhere between the Governd and Gandak rivers and Nepal.

No. 11.- LAR PLATES OF GOVINDACHANDRA OF KANAUJ; 
(VIKRAMA-SAMVAT 1202. 
By F. KIELHORN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN, These copper-plates were found at the village of Lår in the Gôråkhpur district, United Provinces, the Larh' of the Indian Atlas, sheet No. 103, long. 84° 2!, lat. 26° 14'. They were handed over to Dr. W. Hoey by Babu Ramsaran Singh and Babu Mahadeo Singh, and presented by him to the Provincial Museum, Lucknow, in September 1898. My account of them is based on impressions, Bent to Dr. Hultzsch by the late Mr. E. W. Smith. 
The plates are two in number, each of which, to judge from the impressions, measures about 1' 33" broad by 11' high, and is inscribed on one side only. There is a ring-hole in the centre of the lower part of the first plate and a corresponding hole in the centre of the upper part of the second plate; and together with the impressions of the plates there has been sent to me the impression of a circular seal, about 23" in diameter, which bears in high relief, soroes the centre, the legend frimad-Govindachan]dradeva[h], in Någari letters about it high; above the legend, apparently a figure of Garuda ; and below the legend, a conch-shell. The first plate contains 21 and the second 17 lines of writing, which is generally very well preserved. The size of the letters is about th. The characters are Någari, and the language is Sanskrit. As regards orthography, the letter 6 is denoted by the sign for v, except in the word babhrantura, 1. 11; the dental sibilant is frequently employed instead of the palatal, and the palatal occasionally instead of the dental; and the words ámra and támra are written amura and támvra, in lines 19 and 37. 
The inscription is one of the Paramabhaftdraka Mahárdjadhiraja Paramédvara Gôvinda chandradêva. The king rocords in it that, when in residence at Mudgagiri, after bathing in the Ganges on the occasion of the Akshaya-tfitiyê festival, on Monday, the third tithi of the bright half of the month Vaisakha in the year 1202 (given both in words and in figures, 11. 20 and 21), he granted the village of Pôtãohavada in the Pandala pattald, in Gôviedlaka that belonged to Dudhali in Saruvära, to the Thakkura Sridhara, the son of the Thakkura Madhava and son's son of the Thakkura Uddharana (?), a Brahman (learned in the four Vodas) of the Käsyapa gâtra, whose three pravaras were Kasyapa, Àvatsara and Naidhruya. The taxes specified in line 26) are the bhagabhôgakara, pravanikara and turushkadanda. The grant (támra-pattaka) was written by the Karanika, the Thakkura Salhaņa. 
The date regularly corresponds, for the Karttikddi Vikrama-Sativat 1202 expired, to Monday, the 16th April A.D. 1140, which was entirely occupied by the third tithi of the bright half of the month Vaisakha. Of the localities, Mudgagiri is the modern Monghyr, the chief town and administrative head-quarters of the Monghyr district, Bengal; situated on the south bank of the Ganges. Regarding the other places or districts mentioned, I can only say that Saravira

The Hilkt commenced 0 h. 47 m. before mean sunrise and ended 1 h. 4 m. after mean sunrise of the nort day. and was therefore, for the Monday, a prathama-trittyd.The date would show that the date of the in koription editor by me above, Vol. V. p. 115, must after all be taken to correspond to Monday, the 19th April A.D. 1148, paranna tha king could not have bathed in the Ganges both at Benares and at Monghyr on one and the same day.

As the Oņavala pathaka (with Sirasi and Pali included in it) according to the Pali plate formed part of Saruvära, this would indicate in a general way where the localities neationed in the present inscription should be looked for ; but I have searched for them in vain on the maps at my disposal.

No. 12.- A NOTE ON THE BUGUDA PLATES OF MADHAVAVARMAN. 
BFF. KIELHORN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E.; GÖTTINGEN. Tishing to publish the accompanying photo-lithograph of the Buguda plates of Madhavavarman, the text of which I have given above, Vol. III. p. 41 ff., Dr. Haltzsch has asked me to write a note on the alphabet of that inscription. In complying with his request, I take the opportunity of correcting one or two errors which I have allowed myself to commit eight years ago, and of adding a few remarks on certain expressions which occur in the formal part of Médhayavarman's grant. 
In my previous account I have represented the donor, Madhavavarman, as a 8012 of Sainyabhita. As pointed out by Dr. Haltzsch, above, Vol. VI. p. 144, noto 1, the facts of the case are that Saingabhita is a surname of Madhnpavarman himself, and that this Madhava varman Sainyabhita was a son of Yasôbhita. Moreover, a reconsideration of verse 11 of the Inscription leads me to think that Mâdhavavarman also had the biruda Srinivåsa. The name of the village granted I have stated to be Puipiņa ; I now see that the actual reading of the uame, in line 36, is either Puipino or, more probably, Puipino. For the form of the initial , bere used, we may compare the sign for i in -adhyâi, above, Vol. III. p. 342, 1. 17, Plate. 
In the passage enumerating the persons to whom the order is addressed, my text, in line 35, has vyavahtrinah so[dhajranån=, whicb I have proposed to alter to vyavahárinah 
Adzraniina. I now see that the akshara in brackets should be read ka, the word intended being sukaranina. The terms oyavaharin and karana occur together also in lides 14 and 15 of the Gumsûr plates of Nêtribhañja, Jour, Beng. As. Soc. Vol. VI. Plate xxxiii. (where the published text. ibid. p. 669, bas bhyupadraviran and karana); and karana and vyávahárika we find together in the Gauhati plates of Indrapalaparman, the Nowgong plates of Balavarman, and the Bargaon plates of Ratna på lavarman (ibid. Vol. LXVI. Part I. p. 126, 1. 7, and p. 291, 1. 10. aud Vol. IXVII. Part I. p. 111, 1. 54). 
The term saliladhara-purahsarena in line 40 I had proposed to alter to the grammatically correot purahsarart. But whatever may be the rules of grammar, saliladhard-purahsaréna 
ated to be swarman also her, a reconside, and that the facts of the

A NOTE ON THE BUGUDA PLATES. 
pali plates of Mahdağjam plates of Prich, 145, 1.21 ; in une 
turns out to be so well established a term that it should not be altered. We find it, semerine spelt incorrectly, in the plates of the time of Sasankaraja, above, Vol. VI. p. 145, 1.2.1; in und ist the grants of Dandimahâdêvi, ibid. p. 142, 1. 33 ; the Gañjau plates of Prithivivariaclérn. aliitto Vol. IV. p. 200, 1, 19; the Kadopali plates of Mahabhavagupta II., ibid. p. 239, l. 17; uzi the Puri plates in Jour. Bang. As. Soc. Vol. LXIV. Part I. p. 126. Instead of it, we have multis dhårûpurahsaréna vidhing in the plates of Vidyadharabhañja, ibid. Vol. LVI. Part I. p. lol. 1.6; drárásalila-purahsaréna vidhind in the Gumsûr plates of Nêtribhaõja, ill. vol. VI. p. 669; and udakapûrvena in the Chicacole plates of Nandaprabhasjanavarman, Ind. Ant. Vol XIII. p. 49, 1. tin 
Like the expressions just now enumerated, the term akarikratya in line 40 of our grant seems to be peculiar to inscriptions from the Gaõjam district and the countries adjacent to it, in which it occurs frequently. Instead of it we also find, in inscriptions from the same lucalitiut. akaratvana, or, as in the Chicacole plates of Nandaprabhañjanavarman, simply akurun. 
The term lañchhitam, which we have in line 50, albo occurs in the plates of Nétrihlalja. the plates of Vidyadharabhañja, and the plates of Prithivivarmadêya, all from the Gañjawi district. 
The characters employed in these plates are the same as those of 0.g. the Gumsûr plntes ut Natribbañja, of which a rough lithograph is given in Jour. Beng. As. Suo. Vol. VI. Plate xxxiii.; the plates of Vidyadhara bhañja, of which there is a photo-lithograph ibid. Vol. LVI. Part I, Plate ix.; and the Ganjam plates of Prithivivarmadêya. They represent a variety of the northern alphabet which has developed out of the northern alphabet such as we find it in the [Ganjâm] plates- below denoted simply by the letter S. of the time of Sakan karaja of the Gupta year 300, published with a photo-lithograph above, Vol. VI. p. 144, and which I would call the Gañjama variety of the northern alphabet. 
Of initial vowels the text contains au, d, 1, 1, and W. Of these, a and i are denoted by one and the same sign, which, as may be seen from a comparison with the sign for å in line 26 of S.. is really the siga for a only ; gee Adityadévasya, 1. 39, alarikrátya, 1. 40, api, 1. 42, and ükshiptit, 1. 49. The sign for i is nearly the same as that used in S.; compare the i of ita in line 6 of the latter with the i of indôr- in line 1 of the present plates. The sign for î occurs only in Pulpina (or Paiping), 1. 36, and that for u e.g. in utkirnnan, 1. 50. 
Of the signs for medial vowels only a, u and û call for reniarks. In tâ, nchina (the ñ of which does not really differ from the sign for n), and occasionally in på, the đ is denoted by a small hook, turned upwards and attached to the top of the consonant-sign; see jafdh, 1.4, vářichhd, l. 13, and charanáya, 1. 38, and compare in S. tata, 1. 6, gund, I. 14, and karthi, 1. 7 The sign for å ubed (exceptionally) in má at the end of line 25 may be compared with the sign for å in på at the end of line 1 of S.- For either of the vowels u and we bavot (similarly to what is the case in 8.) two signs, compare pundarékan, 1. 22, and kumbka, 1. 23; mürtti, 1. 7, and blúmi, 1. 18 (and with the last again compare bhüni in lines 25 and 26 of 8.). There is a fifth sign, resembling the ordinary sign for 4 in S., which is employed by the writer of the presont 
Part northern alphabet whico denoted simply by the lettersVol. VI. p. 1 of the Gañjam] platoullished with a Phouthern alphabet. 
The inscription is dated in the Gupta year 300, and the grant recorded in it was made at an eclipse of the sun. During the time which could correspond to & Gupta year 300 there was no solar eclipse which was risible in the Ganjam district. The two solar eclipses vearest to that time which were visible in the Gaijām district were one of the 4th November A.D. 617, and one of tle 2nd September A.D. 620. Perhaps I may state here that in line 22 of the same inscription, in the place of the corrupt akshayaniyê, we must in my opinion read akshayanidya. The term akshayanitt ocours also (corrupt) in one of the [Gaajam] grants of Daqdimahadevi, above, Vol. VI. p. 139, 1. 84. 
I have disregarded in the above the exceptional denotation of # and aftor r, e.g, in gurur, 1.4, and prarüdno, 1. 20; compare in S. chaturudad/i., 1.1. In line 19 of the present plates the writer has really written mumüdd, not mumude.

plates for both u and û ; compare durlla- at the end of line 23, dütakó, 1. 51, puraħsaréna, 1.40, and púruva, 1. 34. 
Of the consonants, jh and 6 do not occur in the text, and the signs for chh and then the lattor hardly to be distinguished from the sign for orear only as subscript letters. In general, it may suffice to draw the reader's attention to the forms of ich, e.g. in khyataḥ, 1. 9; 9 and ii in Gargd, 1, 3; é in faétata, l. 12; gh in vighatti, 1. 19; ok in chandraḥ and j in jaléshu, 1. 17; th in ślatha, 1. 3; d) and v in pravôdha, 1. 16; ph in phala, 1.48 ; bh and 27 in mahâbhakumbha, 1. 23, and graha, 1. 26; 1 in komaladalayataló°, 1. 9; and 8 in sanchaya, 1. 8. 
The sigus for ţ and it are those which we find generally used in inscriptions from Eastern India ; compare patunel, 1. 29, shatpada, 1. 22, påtfakta, 1. 36, and bhatta, 1. 40. 
For the form of the single n see e.g. phana, 1, 2, and gumind, 1. 10. When in $. ? or n form the first part of a conjunct, two distinctly different signs are used to denote the two basals; compare in S. mangana, 1, 14, and sañchhannso, 1. 6. In the present plates the signs for n and as first parts of conjuncts differ very slightly, if at all, and one sign only is used to denote the same two nasals as last parts of conjuncts; compare mandalan, l. 10, sanchaya, 1. 8, vářohhó, 1. 18, lánchhitan, l. 50, krislundo, 1. 8, and yajñais, 1. 28. One sign only is used in the present plates also for the subscript chh and th, just as the plates of the time of Sasâu karāja use one sign for the same two letters; .compare in 8. sañchhannó, 1. 6, and ssthityu, 1. 16, and in the present plates våfichha, 1. 13, and sthalt, 1. 23. 
When r precedes another consonant, it is always, as in the modern Någari, denoted by & supersoript sign ; but, excepting in the conjunct ry, the letter y, when it follows upon another consonant, is everywhere denoted by the secondary form of the letter y which in the same position is used throughout (even in ry) in $. So it happens that the signs for such aksharas as tya, nya, shya, sya of the present plates differ very little from the corresponding signs of 8. 
The sign of avagraha is not used in these plates ; nor do we find in them the sign of viráma, except perhaps in the final form of kg used in the word samyak at the commencement of line 43. Of other special signs for final consonants the plates contain one for t, in asakrit, l. 15, kamaldkaravat, 1. 24, Angirovat, 1. 39, and svadánát, 1. 48, and one for ", in gari(ri)yán, 1. 18. 
To determine with confidence the exact time of these plates from the character's seems to me impossible; my impression is that they cannot be earlier than about the 10th century A.D. and that probably they are not much later. 
No. 13. BALODA PLATES OF TIVARADEVA. 
By E. HULTZBOH, PED.. These copper-plates were sent to me in Trngary 1902 by Mr. A. B. Napier, I.C.S., on special duty in the office of the Commissioner of Settlements and Agriculture, Nagpur, before whom they had been produced in an enquiry into the succession to an estate. They belong to one Ude Singh, a resident of Baloda in the Phuljhar Zamindari of the Sambalpur distriot” of the Central Provinces. 
1 Io line 26 the writer has really written mabhodayona, not malodayana. 
I In tenáththan (for tánátthar), l. 10, the writer or engraver has used the subscript sign for t) alao for the format th. For the era of sa-gótram, 1. 24, he had originally put stha, but the back of the paper impression seems to shew that this stha has been altered to spa.No. 13.) 
BALODA PLATES OF TIVARADEVA. 
103 
The plates are three in number and measure about 91" in breadth and about 59" in lieight. Their edges are not raised into rims. The first plate is engraved only on the inner side, and the second on both sides. The third plate is full of writing on the inner side and bears one additional lino, which records the name of the engraver, a little above the middle of the outer side. Some of the lines on the inner side of the third plate are so deeply cut that they show through on the outer side. The writing is on the whole in a state of very good preservation. In the syllable nai of I. 10, a square hole was cut into the plate by the engraver and fresh piece of copper inserted into the hole. . This was probably done in order to correct the syllable nai, which may have been spoiled accidentally in the original engraving. On the left side of each plate is bored & roughly square hole for a ring to connect them. The ring, which had not yet been cut when the plates reached my office, is about 41" in diameter and about it in thickness, Its ends are secured in the lower part of a circular seal, which measures 31" in diameter and closely resembles the seal of the Räjim plates of the same king. The seal bears, in relief on a deep countersunk surface, across the centre a legend in two lines; at the bottom a floral device; and at the top a figure of Garuda, facing the front and somewhat worn, with a chakra on his proper right and a sarkha on his proper left. 
The alphabet is of the same box-headed type as in the Rájim plates. The jihvamúliya occurs in 1. 36, and the secondary form of jh in ujjhita (l. 13). No distinction is made between the secondary forms of ri and ?i (in bhoktrinań, I. 26), and between d and dh (in güdho gadhan, l. 12). In ten instances (kirita, 1. 3 ; lakshmi, 11. 4 and 32 ; tyági, l. 13; kamini-krid ds; 1. 16; $ri, ll. 18, 19, 21; sucht, 1. 20) the secondary form of i is marked by a point in centre of the mark for i; but in the majority of cases the 1 is not distinguished from the i. The r of fri (11. 1, 2, 18, 19, 21, 25) has the same shape as the secondary form of rio Final t occurs in sampat (1. 8), dadyat (1. 36) and vasết (1. 37), and final m in %pitám (1.2). In l. 40 we have the numerical symbols for 7, 9, and 20. 
The language is Sanskrit, mostly proge ; but there is one verso on the seal and another in 1. 1 f., and six verses from the Smritis are quoted in 11. 30-40. As in the Rajím plates, the Vernacular form samvatsaru occurs in 1. 40. As regards orthography, v is used instead of b in vahala (1.5) and Indravala (1. 18), and b instead of u in bapushi (1. 11) and abhibriddhayê (1. 28 f.). The anusvåra before $ is changed into # in nistrinsa (1. 4 f.), varibasya (l. 18 f.), trissataḥ (1. 27), and nzibarist for wpisansdı (1. 32). Between a towel and r, t is always doubled, except in ch=dtra, 1. 34; in jagatraya (1.1) tra is used for ttra, and in étadvaya for etad=dvayan (1. 32) dva is used for ddva. 
Like the Rajim plates, this inscription records & grant by Tivaradêva, as he is called on the seal and in the opening verse, or Mabadiva-Tivararaja (1. 21). On the seal he is styled 
sovereign of Kobala,' and in 1. 19 he is stated to have "acquired the sovereignty of the whole of Kosala." & He was the son of Nannadêve of the family of Pandu, and the grandson of Indrabala (1. 18 f.). Nannadaya and his father Indrabala, who was a son of Udayana of the lunar race, are mentioned also in an inscription at Sirpar, which has been published by Professor Kielhorn, who has also found the names of Udayana of the Pandava family, and perhaps of Indrabala, 'in' a fragmentary inscription of tho Nagpur Museum. According to the same scholar, Tivaradeva must be assigned to about the middle of the eighth century of the Christian era.5

Tivaraddva's edict was issued from Śripura (1.2), which Dr. Fleet has identified with the moderu Sirpur, and is dated on the 27th day of the month Jyaishtha in the oth year of his reign (1.40),... about two years after the Rajim plates. The king granted the village Menkiddaka in the distriot of Sundarikāmārga (1.22) for the benefit of a rest-house (sattra) which had been established at Bilvapadraka at the request of his son-in-law Nannaraja (1. 25f.).

No. 14._INSCRIPTIONS ON THE THREE JAINA COLOSSI 
OF SOUTHERN INDIA, 
By E. HULTZSCH, PH.D. In the course of my two last cold-weather tours I had occasion to visit the sites of the three famous monolithio images at Šravaņa-Beļgoļa in the Hassan district of the Mysore State and at Karkala and Venûr in the South Capara district of the Madras Presidency. For descriptive notices of these monuments the reader is referred to Mr. Rice's Inscriptions at Sravana-Belgola, Introduction, p. 29ff, and Mr. Sewell's Lists of Antiquities, Vol. I. pp. 231 and 236 f. The largest and most ancient of them is the one at Belgola, which, according to Mr. Rice, is 57 feet high and was set up by the minister Châmundard ja between A.D. 977 and 984. The second, at Kirkaļa, is 41' 5" high and was erected by the chief Vira-Pandya in A,D, 1432. Along with the two inscriptions on the image at Kärkala, I publish an inscription (E. below) on a neighbour ng pillar which was raised by the game Vira-Pândy& in A.D. 1436. The smallest and most recent of the three monoliths is the one at Yönür, which is 35 feet high and was established by the chief Timmarâja in A.D. 1604. 
The saint or god whom the three images represent is called in Sanskrit Bahubalin or Bhujabalin' and was believed to have been the son of Âdijina (G. below), i.e. the first Jina Rishabhanåtha. His vernacular name was Gummata (D.), Gummatesa (G.), Gommata or Gommațêsvara. 
The inked Estampages from which I am pablishing the Karkala inscriptions (Nos. 0., D. and E. below) were prepared by my peong. Those of the Belgola and Vênur inscriptions (Nos. A., B., F. and G.) had to be done by Jainas under my supervision, because none but Jainas are permitted to touch the images at Belgola and Vênür. 
4. On the proper right side of the colossus at Belgola. This inscription (No, 52a of 1902) was first published by Mr. Rice, 6 who, however, did not succeed in reading the second word in l. 2. 
The alphabet and language of the first and third lines are Kanarese. The second line is a Tamil translation of 1. 1 and consists of two words, of which the first is written in the Grantha and the second in the Vatteluttu alphabet. The first two lines record that Chamundaraja caused to be made the image at the foot of which the inscription is engraved, and the third line, that Gangard ja caused to be made the balldings which surround the image. 
In Mr. Rica's opinion, these inscriptions " are undoubtedly of the period when that work was completed." A comparison of the alphabet of l. 1 with that of the epitaph of Mârasimha 11.7 and of the alphabet of 1, 3 with that of an inscription of Gangarajas has convinced me that Mr. Rice is correct, 8.8. that 1. 1 belongs to the time of Châmundarâja, the minister of the two Ganga kings Märssimi ha II. and Rachamalla II.,' and that 1. 3 belongs to the time of Gadgaraja, the minister of the Hoysala kipg Vishậuvardhana. 10 The second line is probably conteraporaneous

The alphabet is Någart and the language is Marathi. The first line is a translation of 1. 1 of the preceding inscriptiou (A.), and the second line of l. 3 of the same inscription. As the type of the alphabet of ll. 1 and 2 is quite identical, it may be assumed that both lines were engrayed in the time of Gangaraja, whose name ,occurs in the second line. The Marathi language was perhaps adopted for the benefit of Jaina pilgrims from the Maratha country.

Mr. Rice's reprint of Dr. Barnell's text 8 contains a few improvements, based on a copy which was supplied to him by the late Brahmasari Sastri, the well-known Jaina scholar of Srapaņa. Belgola. 
The alphabet is Kanarese, with the exception of the colophon Sri-Påndyaráya in l. 15, which is in Grantha characters. The inscription consists of two Sanskfit verses and a few words in Sanskrit prose (1. 14 f.). It records that the chief Vira-Pandya (1. 11) or Pandyaraya (1. 15), who was the son of Bhairavêndra of the lunar race, caused to be made the image of Bahubalin, on which the inscription is engraved.

According to verse 1, Vira-Pandya was prompted to undertake this work by the Jaina priest Lalitakirti, who belonged to the lineage of Panasogel and to the Désigana. The same verse occurs in another Karkala inscription of Immaţi-Bhairariga of the family of Jipadatta, mm apparently one of the successors of Vira-Påndya,-- who built the Chaturmakba basti at K&rkala in Saka-Samvat 1508 (expired), the Vyaya year. It follows from this, that the Jaina svamins of Hanagoge bore the hereditary title Lalitakirtis and were the spiritual preceptors of the chiefs of Karkala. 
The day on which the image was consecrated fell into the (expired) Saka year 1868 (in numerical words, 1. 5 f., and in figures, I. 14 f.), the cyclic year Virðdhikrit. According to Professor Kielhom's calculation, the date corresponds to Wednesday, the 13th February AD, 1482.

TRANSLATION. On the 12th (titki) of the bright fortnight) of Phålguna in the Rakshasa year (which corresponded to the year) 1358 of the Saka king. Let it grant you (every) wish (the image of) Brahman, the devotee of Jina, who took up his abode* (here) in order to grant with pleasure (every) desire to the glorious prince Vira-Påņdya, the son of Bhairava of the family of Jinadatta ! 
FOn the proper right side of the colossus at Vânür; 
Saka-Samyat 1525. 
A fairly correct transcript of this inscription (No. 72 of 1901) was published by Mr, Rice in the Introduction to his Inscriptions at Sravana-Belgola. 
The inscription is disfigured by a crack, which has injured one or more letters in almost every line. The alphabet is Kanarese, and tho language is Sanskrit verse. In several instances the letter d is closed and consequently identical in shape with dh. This remark applies algo to the next inscription (G.). 
The inscription records that Timmardja of the family of Chômunda set up the image of the Jina named Bhujabalin at nûra (the modern Vôạir). This chief was the younger brother of Påndya, the son of queen Pandyaka, and the nephew and son-in-law of Rayakuvara.8 From the fact that the inscription mentiong his uncle and mother, but not his father, it may be concluded that he and his family practised the aliya-santana, 3.a. the inheritance through nephews. Even now the Jaina laymen (frávaka) of South Canara follow this rule, while the Jaina priests (indra) practise the makkaļa-tantána, 1.0, the inheritance through sons. 
Timmarâja is stated to have set up the image at the instance of the Jains priest Chárukirti; who belonged to the Désigana and was the pontiff of Belgafa (the modern Gravana-Belgola). Hence the latter must have been the spiritual preceptor of his family. This suggests that the Châmuşda to whose family Timmarâja belonged (1 14 f.) may be identical with the minister Châmunqaraja who had set up the colossal statue at Belgoļa.7 
The day on which the image was consecrated fell into the expired Saka year 1825 (in numerical words, 1. 4 f.), the cyclio year go bhakrit. Professor Kielhord kindly contributes the following caloulation : 
"The date regularly corresponds, for Saka-Sama vat 1525 expired = obhakrit, to Thursday, the lat March A.D. 1604, when the 10th tithi of the bright half ended 3 h. 33. m, and the nakshatra was Pushya from 1 h. 58m. (or 2 h. 38 m.), after mean sunrise. The sig Mithuna was lagna from about 5 h. 20 m. to about 7 h. 20 m. after true sunrise, s.e. the tim indiosted by the date is about midday."

No. 15. TWO JAINA INSCRIPTIONS OF IRUGAPPA. 
BY E. HULTZSCH, Pa.D. 
A.m-Dated in the Dundubhi year. From an inscription on a lamp-pillar in front of a Jaina temple at Vijayanagaral it is knowo that the general Chaicha or Chaichapa and his son Iruga or Irugapa were hereditary ministers of king Harihara II. of Vijayanagaras. An inscription at Sravana-Belgoļa states that the general Chaicha or Chaichapa had already been the minister of Bukkaraya, ie, of Bukka I., the predecessor of Harihara II. 
The subjoined Tamil and Grantha inscription (No. 41 of 1890) is engraved on the base of the north wall of the store-room in the Jaina temple of Vardhamina at Tirupparuttikkunrus near Conjeeveram. It records that the village of Mahendramangalam in the division of Mêvanqûr was granted to the temple by the minister Irugappa, the son of the general Vaichaya. The donor is of course identical with Irugapa, the son of Chaichapa, who was mentioned in the preceding paragraph. He is stated to have made the gift for the merit of Bukkaraja, the son of Arihararaja, se. Bukka II., the son of Harihara II. Hence the Dundubhi year in which the grant was made must correspond to A.D. 1382. But Professor Kielborn has shown that the details of the date do not work out correctly..

B.-Dated in the Prabhava year. This Grantha inscription (No. 42 of 1890) is engraved on the roof of the wand apa in frout the shrine ip the same temple as the preceding inscription (A.), and consists of one Sanskrit rerse in the Sârdulavikridita metre. It records that the rang apa on yhich it is found was built by lilie same general Irugappa, the son of the general Vaichaya, at the instance of (018 wpiritual preceptor, tlle Jaina priest) Pushpasona, in the year Prabhava. This year might be leieant for Parabhaya A.D. 1366-67, Thich yould, however, fall into the reign of Bukka I. Hence it follows that Prâbliava is used on account of the metre instead of Prabhava= A.D. 1387-88, which falls into the time of Bukka II., the contemporary of Irugappa.3 
In this inscription the temple of the Jina Vardlia mâna is said to have been included iu Kanchi, of which Tirupparuttikkuprut yas evidently considered a suburb.

No. 16.--TWO BRAHMI AND KHAROSHTHI ROCK-INSCRIPTIONS

BY J. PH. VOGEL, LL.D. The first of these two rock-inscriptions Tras discovered by Sir E. C. Bayley but Kanhiêra, three iniles to the east of Lower Dharmgilâ on the bank of the Mânji torrent, and was edited by him in 1854 from drawings made by Lieutenants Crofton and Dyas. In 1375 it was reproduced again and discussed by General Cunningham? 
The second inscription I found last summer in the course of an archeological tour zu the Kångra district nour a place called Pathyår, situated nine miles south of Kanhidra on the bank of the Baner rivulet, at a distance of about one mile from the Dâdh Travellers Bungalow.

The two inscriptions are so nearly alike in script, substance and general character that it appears desirable to publish them together, the more so as the Kanbjara inscription has not yet been edited satisfactorily and the Pathyår inscription, as far as I kuow, has not been noticed before by any archæologist. 
The legend in both cases is given in two different alphabets - Brahmi and Kharôshthi, though evidently of two very different periods. In each case the inscription contains only Two words in both scripts, whereas a third word occurs in one script only. But at Kanhiara this additional word belongs to the Brahmî, while at Pathyår it forms part of the Kharðshthi legend. The explanation of this third word is somewhat difficult. Otherwise the reading may be said to be beyond doubt, owing to the enormous size and the clearness of the letters, which are deeply cut in hard granite boulders. Finally two auspicious symbols are iu each case added after the Brâhmi legend, one of which is the well-known sz'cestika, 
The Kanbiâra inscription was read by Sir E. C. Bayley as follows:--Krislunayasasa ardina in Kharoshthi, and Krishnayasasya dráma medangisya in Bråhmi. I may state at once that the correct reading of the first word appears to be Krishamyasasa and Krishnayasasya respectively, whereas the length of the first a of dráma, as a matter of fact, is not expressed in Kharðshthi. He explains it as “the garden of Krishnayasas, to which in the second inscription some wag has apparently added the epithet med angisya (corpulent) from meu (fat) and anya (body)." 
Cunningham, however, preferred to consider áráma as a synonym of vihara, translating it by “the monastery of Krishnayasas," and even went so far as to derive the name Kanhiara from Kanhiya-yasas-arána, Kanhiya being a synonym of Krishna. The third word he read 
zidangisya, and he thought it to be the name of the district or possibly of the recorder of the inscription." 
Now, before entering upon any discussion of these doubtful points, it will be well to examine the other inscription, which from its similarity is likely to contribute fresh evidence. The Pathyêr inscription consists of two lines, cut into one stone. The upper line gives the two words in Brahmi followed by a svastiku and a foot-print. In the lower line, which was partly buried in the ground, is the Kharôshthi legend, which consists of three words. The Brahmi letters are of considerable size, the final one being not less than 1 high. The Kharðshthi characters are much smaller (5" to 9"). Thus, notwithstanding the difference in the number of letters, both lines are about equal in length, viz. 71. 
It is evident at once that the two words in Brâhmi correspond to the second and third words of the Kharôshthi legend. I read them Vayulasa pitkariņia or, in correct spelling, Váyulassa puklharini, the meaning being simply “Váyula's lotus-pond." With regard to the first word of the Kharðshthi, the meaning is less obvious. Manifestly it is a genitive defining the proper name Vậyulassa. It seems to me almost certain that it has to be read rathidaraldı, i.e. in Sanskrit rathitarasya. The may be either short or long. If short, the word is to be taken as the comparative of rathin ; if long; of the Vedic rathu. The meaning remains the same, viz. charioteer' (from ralla). According to the St. Petersburg Dictionary the word rathitara occurs as a proper name in the Vishnupuránu also. But the meaning which has to be assigned to the word in the Pathyar inscription is, I believe, a different one. Râthi is the name of an agricultural caste in Kingfa.3 If Váyula really Was a Råthî, we may infer that, in the time of the inscription, the Rathis were not inhabitants

**f that fertile part of the valley to which Pathyår certainly belongs. For, if this had been The case, a man belonging to the Rathi caste would hardly have designated himself as such in order to distinguish himself from his neighbours. This, as far as I can see, is the only historical conclusion which can be drawn from the Pathyår inscription. Its chief interest Therefore, is purely palæographical. 
If we compare the two inscriptions, it is obvious that the Pathyâr stone exhibits a nucl carlier type of script than the Kauhiara one. This is evident in part from some of thi Kharoshthi letters, e.g, the s, wbich at Pathyár has the closed shape of the Asôka period Ishereas at Kapbiara it is open as in the Saka-Kushana inscriptions. On the whole, however che Kbarôshthi of both inscriptions is fairly identical. But & striking difference is showi in the Brahmi legends. The Kanhiêra inscription was assigned by Bayley and Cuuninghan to the first century after Christ. Possibly it is later. The y with its three vertical stroke of equal length agrees best with forms of the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The ci shows a grea l'escmblance to the type of this letter in the 2nd century. The m is angular instead roanded as in the more ancient type. The $, ou the contrary, with its straight stroke has a more archaic form. So has the g, which is angular and not rounded. 
The Brâhmi type of the Pathyar inscription, however, corresponds entirely with the of the Asöka period -- the earlier Maurya type as Professor Bühler called it-- and therefore oa safely be said to belong to the 3rd century B.C.3 We may infer that both Brahmi an Kharôshthi were known and used in the Kangra valley from that time until the first or secon century after Christ. 
It is a fact worth noticing, that, while the indigenous character had developed considerabl during the course of the three or four centuries, the foreign alphabet had practically remaine the same. The most plausible explanation would be that in those parts the Brahmi was th popular script used in commerce and common life, while the use of the Kharôshtbî was limite to official documents and was in consequence fairly constant. The greater importance attache to the Brahmî may also appear from its taking the first place in the Pathyâr inscription an from the larger size of the letters, though it must be admitted that the fuller reading is give in Khazôshthi. In the Kanhiåra inscription the Brahmi has the additional word. But in bot inscriptions the mangalas are placed after the Brahmi and not after the Kbarðshthî. 
. Now, to return to the Kanhiåra inscription, it remains to be considered whether t] newly found inscription throws guy light on its meaning. First of all one feels inclined assign to the word viráma the ordinary meaning of 'garden,' and not that of monaster: as Cunningham did. For, considering that Vâyula found it worth while to out an inscriptio which would stand the ages, simply to indicate that he was the owner of a lotus-pond, the is no renson to assume that Kțishnayasas did not do the same with regard to his garde Moreover, in the case of a monastery the founder would preferably have written his name i the building, and not on two boulders lying near it. 
With regard to the doubtful term mcdargisya, we may with Cunningham reject Bayley supposition that the word was added by some wag in order to ridicule Krishnayasas. It wou have been a very poor joke indeed and scarcely worth the trouble of cutting into bard granit And are we to believe that the same wag had cut the two mangalas also, possibly to mal amends for the offence ?

Most probably the third word in both inscriptions indicates the caste or clan of the person mentioned. Among the meanings assigned to the word nêda by the St. Petersburg Dictionary there is that of a certain mixed caste.' But this explanation would have to be abandoned, if with Cunningham we read madaigisya. It is true that the d-stroke is ordinarily attached to the right, not to the left leg of the m; but, on the other hand, we never find the e-stroke turned to the right. Comparing the manner in which the a-stroke is attached to p, & and h, we musi consider Cunningham's reading correct. Unfortunately madangisya is as difficult to explain as medargisya. If Te ignore the i in the penultimate syllable, it would correspond to the Sanskrit Dlútangasya; but that a member of this caste would be the owner of a garden and bear the name of Krishnayaśas is scarcely admissible. 
It was stated above that one of the two mangalas added to the Brâhmî legend is the svastike. The other Cunningham interpreted as an abbreviation of the syllable on This, however, does Lot seem very probable considering that that sacred syllable is always found at the beginning, berer at the close of a sentence. But when we compare the two inscriptions in this respect. We discover a remarkable resemblance between the two mrungalas also. The mystic sign of the KanhiÂm inscription appears to be nothing but an ornamental development of the foot-priut, It would be hazardous to draw from these signs any conclusions with regard to the creed of the authors. It is true that the foot-print and the svastila are favourite signs of good omeni with the Buddhists; but it should be borne in mind that they are equally honoured by the Hindûs in general and probably were so even in pre-Buddhistio times. 
Que point still remains to be discussed,- the language. In the older inscription it is Prakrit or Middle-Indian of the Sauragêni-Mahâråshtri, not of the Màgadhi type, as appeals from the ” in pukkharini. In the Kanhiåra inscription there is a difference of language in the two legends. The Kharðshthi legend is written in a Prakpit of which the distinction made between the three sibilants is a remarkable feature.

Both of them are intended to commemorate the donations of a king Tammusiddhi or Tammusiddha, who belongs to a family of Telugu ohiefs of whom numerous records have boen discovered since 1892 in the Chingloput, North Arcot, Nellore and Kistna districts. On these materials Mr. Venkayya has based his valuable account of the Chôdas of the Telugu country in the annual Report for 1899-1900. However, as none of the inscriptions made use of by DIX'. Venkayya have been published until now, I shall confine my remarks to the facts furnished by the following two inscriptions alone. 
The Tiruvalangadu inscription is damaged in a few places, but the illegible passages can unsily be restored, partly from the context alone, and partly with the help of the Tiruppåsûr inscription. It is written in Grantha characters. The size of the letters varies from $" to 2", Line 8 contains the rage subscript sign for jha in nirjjhard. The language is Sanskrit, and, with the exception of the concluding words svasty=astu, the whole text is in verse. As regards orthography, it may be pointed ont here that in the middle of a word t is written instead of d before a sonant consonant in the word patura in 11. 1, 2, 3, and in bhavatbhir in l. 21. 
After two introductory Terses in praigo of the donor, who, as stated above, is called both Tammusiddhi (11. 2, 17, 18) and Tammusiddha (11. 1, 20, 21), the inscription gives his genealogy, which shows the characteristical features of the Chôļa genealogies. 
It begins with some mythical anoostors. From the lotus of Vishņu's navel sprang Brahman (yv. 3, 4), from bim Narichi, from him Kasyape (v. 5), from him the Sun (v. 6), and from him dland (v. 7), in whose family there were born mapy kings (v.8). This is the gene8 logy of the solar race as taught in the Puranas. It is found also in the Udayondiram plates of Prithivipati 11. and those of Vira-Chola, 3 As well as in the Kalingattu-Paranis and the Vikkirama-Solar-Ul; but in the last three passages the third name appears as Kabyapa or Kachchipag instead of Kaśyapa. The Vikkirama-Solar-Ula differs besides in placing Kâbyapa before Marichi, and the Udayêndiram platus of Prithivipati II. omit Manu. 
The inscription vext mentions three kings who form the connecting link between these sages of old and the diroct ancestors of Tammusiddhi. The first of them, born in the lineage of Vann, is Kalikala (v. 9). Kalikåla is identical, of course, with the ancient half-mythical Chola king whose name is generally given as Karikala. The various traditions about him have been collected by Dr. Hultzsch. In the present inscription we are told that he constructed the bauka of the Kövéri, and that, when he had lifted Mount Meru with his play-staff, the quarters were greatly diaturbed or confounded. The story about the construction of the banks of the Pongi or Kávéri ia alluded to also in the Kalingattu-Parani,? the Vikkirama-Solan-Uld,' and the Jarge Leyden grant. The second legend, implied by the words of the inscription, is not known to me, but it is probably connected in some way with another legend recorded by the two Tamil poems. According to the Kalisgattu-Parani Karikala inscribed on the side of Nount Méru the whole history of the Tamil race as foretold by the Rishi Närada, and in the Vikkirama-Solam-Uld he is spoken of as "the king who set his tiger-banner on the mountain whose summit gleams with Crystal waterfalls," where the mountain meant by the poet would seem to be again Mount Meru.

TWO INSCRIPTIONS OF TAMMUSIDDHT. 
121 
The verses 10 and 11 are devoted to a king who is said to have been born in the lineage of Kalikala, and to bave had two names,Madhurântaka, sie, the death to Madhurâ,' and Pottapi Chola. The former name he acquired by conquering Madhură, the capital of the Pandyas, whose women he made widows; the latter was given to him for having founded, in the country of the Andhras, the town of Pottapi. Madhurântaka Pottapi-Chola is a name frequently met with as that of a local chief in the inscriptions at Conjeeveram, the ancient Kâtichipara; in the list compiled by Mr. Sewell' it occurs more than thirty times. Provided, however, that all thesia inscriptions are to be referred to the same person, it is impossible that that chief of Kanchipura should be identical with the ancestor of Tammusiddhi; for one of his inscriptions is dated in the 18th, and another in the 21st year of Tribhuvanachakravariin Rajarajadêya, which correspond to A.D. 1233-34 and 1236-37, respectively. He must have been a much younger member of the family, and Mr. Venkayya, for other reasons, is inclined to identify him with Chôla-Tikka. who probably was the successor of Tammusiddhi. The identification of Pottapi, which Madhorantaka Pottapi-Ohôļa is said to have founded, must be left to future researchea. 
In Madhurántaka Pottapi-Ohola's race was born Tilungavidya (v. 12). The only feat recorded of him is the erection of a pillar of viotory with a figure of Garuda at the top of it at, Ujyapuri. Ujyapuri may be the modern Ojipuram or Ujjapuram, 18 miles east-south-east of Kollégal in the Coimbatore district. Mr. Sewell states that there is an old ruined fort at that place, and there is no difficulty in assuming that one of thesa Telugu Cholas should have extended his conquests beyond the Kávéri, if another boasts even to have taken Madhura. 
With verse 13 begins a coherent genealogy of the direct ancestors of Tammnsiddhi. In Tilungavidya's family was born king Siddhi (v. 13). His younger brother was Betta (I.), who had several sons (v. 14), the eldest of whom was Dayabhima (v. 15). Dåyabhima's younger brother was Erasiddhi (v. 16). He again had three sons, Manmasiddhi or Manmasiddha, Botta (II.), and Tammusiddhi, whose mother bore the name of Sridovi (vv. 17-20). Of these only Siddhi, Dâyabhima and Manmasiddhi are described in terms implying that they actually reigned, while of Betta II. it is expressly stated that, being given to the practice of austerities, he conferred, after the death of Manmasiddhi, the government on his younger brother Tammusiddhi. 
In verse 21 we are informed that in the Sake year 1120 ( A.D. 1207-8) Tammasiddhi allotted to the lord of Vatatavi all the revenues due to the king in the villages belonging to the temple. The inviolability of this order is enjoined in the two concluding verges (22, 23). As regards the name of the god, it is apparently derived from that of the village where the temple is situated, Vatâtavi or its modern synonym Vataraṇya being Sanskrit renderings of the Tamil Tiruvalangadu, 'the holy banyan foresti? 
The Tiruppågür inscription closely resembles the Tiruválavgåda inscription in outwarci appearance as well as in its contents. It is written in Grantha characters, about 13" high. Tho form of the subscript jha in wrijhard in l. 19 slightly differs from that of the Tiruvalangadu inscription, the loop to the left having disappeared here altogether. The initial & also has a

* Loc. cit. p. 19. In the genealogical table, ibid. p. 18, Mr. Venkayya mentions a certain Madhurautaka Pottapi-Choqasiddhi who belonged to another branch of the Telugu Chola. But he also cannot possibly be the person of that name in the present inscription, as he is represented as a descendant of Telungabijjana, whereas thu Madharantaka Pottapi-Cuðla of our inscription was an ancestor of that king.

Very peculiar form in l. 61, whereas in l. 11 it appears in the usual shape. The language is Sanskrit, and the whole is in verse, with the exception of the words svasty=astu at the end. Here alse au surd consonant is written instead of a sonant in patna (11, 2, 3, 4) and bharatblin (1. 64), 'incl besides in drikthyán (1. 4) and dik dakshina (1. 35). 
Of the 23 verses of the Tiruvala ógádu inscription 16 reappear in this inscription, occasion ally with slight variations. With respect to the earlier part of the genealogy (vv. 2-9) it is to be noticed that the verses about Dlanu and Tilungavidya are omitted here. That portion also which iloals with the direct line of TanmusicIlhi's ancestors (vv. 10-17) shows one important point of clifference. No niention is made of Betta I. and of Dâyabhima. Instead of the two verses stetritel to them in the Tiruvalargâdu inscription we find here a verse (11) stating that in king Sidili",family was born kiug Nallasiddhi. In the following verse Erasiddhi is called his younger brother, which term in the identical verse 16 of the Tiruvalangâdu inscription applies t1 Darabhîma spoken of in the preceding verse, and it might therefore easily be imagined that Dávalhîma and Nallasiddhi were only different names of the same king. Fortunately, an inscription at Tiruvorriyûr, a quoted by Dr. Hultzsch in his Annual Report for 1893, paragraph 15. leaves no doubt that they were two distinct persons, and the pedigree to be derived from the ttre inscriptions Cdited bere is thus to be arranged in the following manner :

Besides the nanc of Nallasiddhi the Tiruppâsûr inscription contains little that is new, Nallasiddhi seems to have taken possession of Kanchi or Conjeeveram ; for in verse 11 it is said, with a well-known pun, that, when the southern quarter had obtained him as her husband, she Was yalita-kichi-gunił, which may be understood as having dropped her girdle' or 'haviug lost Kanchi. In verse 15 we are told once more, but in a more explicit way, that after the leath of Manmasiddhi the government passed without any disturbances into the hands of Tammti siidhi, Betta II. being of it religions turn of mind and therefore renouncing his claims to the thryne in favour of his younger brother.

TRANSLATION. (Verse 1.) Hail to that glorious Tammusiddha, the dust of whose troops, which touches the lotus of Brahman, (will be the cause, I imagine, of creating the future world ! 
(V. 2.) Triumphant is king Tammusiddhi, whose bop is victorious, who has washed of all sins, whose talk is always sweet, who has acquired the whole range of sciences, who has poured out the water of donation, who is difficult to be overcome by the tricks of (iris) enemies, (and) who has appeased the torments of the Kali (age). 
(V. 3.) From the navel of Padmanabba reposing on the waters sprang a certain wonderful lotus, the cause of all things, which, on account of his (Vishnu's) eyes emitting light now soft, now fierce, used to close and to open even before the creation. 
(V. 4.) From this (lotus) sprang Virinchi, who, manifesting, as it were, the action of rajass because (he) dwelt long in ita interior, seemed to create companions similar (to himself), when his image was reflected by the crest-jewels of the snake (which formed) the couch of the husband of 8.1. 
(V.5.) From him rose Marichi as the sun from the eastern mountain. From him (again) Fent forth Kasyapa as the light from that (sun).

TWO INSCRIPTIONS OF TAMUUSIDDHI, 
123 
(V. 6.) From him originated a certain bulb (which was the originz) of a racel of kings, the auspicious jewel-lamp to the three worlds, the body of which is the Veda, which was a fire destroying the forest of darkness, the cause, moreover, of fixing quarters and times. 
(V. 7.) The divine Manu quickly descended from thence, he who first acquired the title of king, Tho had plenty of virtues, (and) who composed all the rules of policy, in order to rulc thuis (world), like the primeval spirit (Vishņu) who resides in the orb of that (sun). 
(V.8.) In this family of Manu were many kings who made their faine rush along like torrents, rulers even of heaven and earth who laid down the principles of (just) policy without opposition. 
(V. 9.) In that family was king Kalikåla who constructed the banks of the Kavêri. When (lue) had lifted Mount Mêru with his play-staff, the quarters were greatly disturbed. 
(V. 10.) In his race was born he who, after his conquest of Madhurâ getting renowned by the name of Madhurántaka, cruelly caused the Pandya women to take off completely their ornaments (so that they were) as before (when they had been wearing fine pearl ornaments) ;* 
(V. 11.) Who, crowned with victory (and) famous for the strength of (luis) arm, after having founded in (the country of) the Andhras the town called Pottapi, bore the title of Chóla preceded by that (name). 
(V. 12.) In his race (was) that king Tilungavidya wlio erected the famous pillar adorned with a waying banner of fame at Ujyapuri; I am sure, it is since that time that the suu tarries for a moment in the midst of the sky, (his) charioteerd stopping out of brotherly affcction, when he perceives the Garuda at the top of that (column). 
(V. 13.) (Born) in his family, king Siddhi ruled the earth, on whose arms and on whose feet depended the life of his clients and that of his enemies (respectively). 
(V. 14.) His younger brother was the mighty king Betta. To him also were born sous who defended those who asked them for protection. 
(V. 15.) The eldest of them, king Dâyabhima, whoge hand was reddened by pulling the hair of the goddesses of royal fortune belonging to (his) enenies, ruled the earth. 
(V. 16.) His younger brother (was) king Êrasiddhi, who, having driven far away the Kali (age), determined, as it were, to prevent its return, piled up his abundant fame like a wall of crystal at the ends of the quarters. 
(V. 17.) He had three sons, rulers of the globe, (attired) with the brilliant jewel of heroismı. Attended by them who were full of energy, the father shone for along time like Triņêtra7 frith his beaming (three) eyes. 
(V. 18.) The eldest of these, the lord Manmasiddhi, ruled the carth, the dark-blue limits of which were the briny ocean. The dark-blue sky became a cuckoo in the cage (which wus) his continually rising fame. 
? Or “a cane.' The sun from which the solar dynasty descends is compared to x bulb with a spronting shoot. 
* With ohhandas-tanum compare such epithets of the sun as véd-Angad in Mahabh. 3, 3, 19, or vera meiriik in the Markandayapurâna, 102, 22. The latter passage contains also AU account of the origin of this appellation, 
* The term nirjhara is used in allusion to the second oneaning of Kshamábhrit, ' & mountain, 
+ The pun contained in the word mitdnta-mukl-dbharandh, the correct interpretation of which I owe to Dr. Fultzsch, can hardly be rendered in English. In the first case the compound must be taken as sitantant muktany abharanáni ydbhih, in the second as nitonta mukta dbharandni yasdm. 
The compound madhyd-nyoma is formed in accordance with Panini, 2, 1, 18. Prof. Kielhorn, who drew my attention to this rule, quotes as an analogous caso madhyd-dinam, in the midst of the dny,' in Trivikramablintta's Damayanti cat hd, in the first prose passage after I. 80 (p. 15 of the Nirnayasågarn Press clition)

(V. 19.) When he had ascended to the celestial region, the middle (brother), king Betta, being given to the practice of austerities, conferred the government ou (1248) younger (brothor) Tammusiddhi.

(V. 2.) This is the order of Tammusiddha famous in the three worlds, which is borne hy kings on (their) radiant diadems. 
(V. 23.) "This road of piety should be carefully preserved by all of you ;" thus does Tanmusiddha make a perpetual request to future kings, (his) head being lowly bent, (but not (lie) bow.

(V. 15.) After that, when the eldest (brother) had gone to heaven, the middle one of them, who was called king Betta, being free from passions on account of (his religious) austeritica (an) despising the desire for (worldly) pleasures, conferred the government, without any distura bances, on Tammusiddhi, though being the younger (brother),

(V. 19.) And in the same year (viz. 1129) this (king Tammusiddhi) gave to him (1.8. the lord of Pasipura) the village called Kaivantür, to the delight of the merchants of his town. 
No. 18.- ARULALA-PERUMAL INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF PRATAPARUDRA; 
SAKA-SAMVAT 1238. 
By E. HULTZSCH, Ph.D. This inscription (No. 43 of 1893) is engraved on the west side of the base of the verandah surrounding the stone-platform called “ the hill ” (malaz) in the Arulâļa-Perumal temple at Little Conjeevoram. The first six lines are fully preserved; but of 11. 7-10 the beginnings are built in. The preserved portion contains seven verses in the Sanskřit language and the Grantha alphabet. Verse 4 is followed by a proge passage in the Tamil alphabet and language, and another Tamil proge passage occurs between vy. 5 and 6. 
Vv. 2-4 record that Muppiời, & general (ntyaka) of the Kakatiya king Prata parudra of Ekasilânagari, came to Kåñchi and installed a certain Mânavira as governor of Kiichi. The Tamil portion records that the same Muppiţi-Nayaka 'granted the revenue from two villages to the Arulâ ļa-Perumal temple at Kanchipuram. This revenue amounted to an annual sum of 1,002 "mádai of Gandagôpåla." Of this sum, 240 madai were set aside for paying the attendants of a flower-garden on the southern bank of the Velká, which the donor lind purchased for 500 panam from a certain Peramal-tâdar ;! 360 milduí for daily offerings, 
t6.; 20 medai for purificatory rites in Chaitra ; and 332 mádas for buildings. Those lines which ihre only partially preserved seem to have contained a list of gifts of ornaments and articles of worship (1. 6 f.), a list of buildings to be erected in the temple (1.8), and a list of trees to be planted in the flower-garden (1. 9). The inscription ends with praises of Muppidi-Nayaka 
The inscription contains two dates, both of which fell into Šaka-Samyat 1238 (expired), Iko Nala-sauvatsara, = A..D. 1316-17. On the first date Muppidi installed Månavira (verse .), and on the second date he made his grant to the temple (line 3). Professor Kielhorn has (nivoured me with the following calculation of these two dates: " The first date regularly corre.

corresponds to Wednesday, the 16th June A.D. 1316, which was the 21st day of the month of Mithuna (Agi) and on which the lith tithe (of the dark half of Jyaishtha) ended 17 h. 47 m. after mean sunrise." 
The two villages granted by Muppiới were Paiyyûr, with the hamlets of Âyirachchéri and Gummidippûņời, in the district of Paiyyûr-kôţtan, and Pondaipâkkam in Kachchiyûr nádu. According to Mr. Crole's Manual of the Ohingłoput District (p. 438), Paiyyûr köttam formed part of the modern Ponyári taluk, and several villages which are stated to have been situated in that lóttam have actually been traced in this tâlaka. Paiyyûr, the head quarters of the district, is not found on the map, but its position is indicated by its haralet Gum midippûņdi. The whereabouts of Pondaipakkum and Kachchiyur-nâ qu are settled by a copper-plate grant of Venkatapati, dated Saka-Samyat 1526, Krôdhin, where both Podavakam and Kachchûr are stated to have belonged to Kachchi-nadu, a subdivision of Ikkâţtu-kôttam. According to tho Chingleput Manual (p. 438), the district of Ikkattu-kottam corresponded to the modern Tiruvallûr tåluka and was subdivided into Kakkalûr-nadu and Kachchi-nadu. Ikkadu, Kâkkalûr, and several other villages of Kakkalûr-nadu, Kachchûr-nadu and Malaya-nadu in Ikkattu-kôţtam, which are mentioned in the British Museum plates of Sadasivaraya, can still be traced on the maps of the Tiruvallûr tâluka ard the Kalahasti Zamîndâri. Pondaipakkam or Podavá kam is also found on the former map as Pondavâkkams and Kachchiyûr, Kachchi or Kachchûr, the head-quarters of the núdu to which this village belonged, is represented on the second map by Kachchûr, about one mile south of Ponda vâkkam. The river Velkâ mentioned in line 4 is the Vehke or vêgavati, which flows past the Arula!a-Perumal temple.. 
The chief interest of this inscription lies in the statement that, in June 1316 A.D., Conjeeveram was tributary to the Kakatiya king Prata parudra of Èkašilanagari, 1.e. Warangal.? Another inscription of Pratâparudra is found as far south as the Jambu kêśvara temple near 'Trichinopoly.8 Three inscriptions of his at Bezvada (No. 306 of 1892), Warangal (No. 109 of 1902) and Palivela (No. 501 of 1893) are dated in Saka-Samyat 1220 (Vilambin), the Pramadi-sanyatsara (i.e. Saka-Sarvat 1235), and Saka-Sanyat 1239 (Piògale). 
Who was the Mânavira whom Pratáparudra's general Muppiới installed as governor of Kânchi ? An inscription of Saka-Samvat 1219, Hêmalambin (= A.D. 1297-98), at Narasarâvu pêţa (No. 213 of 1892) states that Manma-Gandagôpåla, Raya-Gandagopala or Manuma Gandagôpåladéva-Chồdamahârâja, the eldest son of Nallesiddhi, was a subordinate of Pratápa. rudra' and took possession of Kåüchipura.10 An earlier chief of the same family, Vijaya. Gandagôpåladova, was also connected with Conjeeveram, where three of his inscriptions, dated in Saka-Samvat 1187, have been found.11 Two records of the Aruļaļa-Perumal temple (Nos. 34 and 35 of 1893), dated in Saka-Sarovat 1156 and 1127, belong to two other chiefs of the same family, Chộla-Tikka and Tammusiddhi.1% Nallasiddhi, an uncle of Tammusiddhi, is stated to have occupied Kanohi.18 If it is borne in mind that several of these later Cholas

Another point in favour of this theory is the fact that, at the time of the inscription, the standard coin of Conjeeveran was the "mádar of Gandagôpala". (1. 4), which owes its name evidently to one of the later Chilas, several of whom. bore the gurname Gandagopala. The latest known date of Raja-Gandagôpåladêya (i.e. Mamma* Gandag påla) is Saka-Sarnyat 1221, which was the 9th year of his reign, in an inscription at Nellore (No. 194 of 1894). This date is 17 years prior to the installation of Mà navi d the meantime Conjoeveram had been in the possession of Raviyarman of Kerala, who was crowned at Kiichi in A.D. 1312-13 and made & grapt to the Aruldla-Perumal temple in A.D. 1315-16. Can it be that he was driven out by Muppidi, who installed Mångvira in June 13161 An allusion to this might be found in the statement (verse 3) that, before entering Kanchi Muppiţi "put to flight the princes of the South."

This Sanskrit name is represented in the inscriptions of the temple by its Tamil equivalent Tiruttoņdišvara. Both names refer to the 63 devotees of Siva? (Tiruttondar or Bhaktajana), whose lives are narrated in the Periyapurdnan, and one of whom is supposed to have been a chief of Tirupamanallur itself. 18

SIX INSCRIPTIONS AT TIRUNAMANALLUR. 
193 
An ingorintion of the Chola king Parantaka I. (A. below) states that the stone temple of Tittondecar was built by his son Råjådityadêva. Hence it is also called Råjådityểsvars in some of its inscriptions. 
Begides the shrine of Tiruttoņdiśvara or Râjådityêśvara, the same temple included the shrine of Agastyasvara which is mentioned in several inscriptions of the temple. Another inscription (No. 365 of 1902) records a gift to the temple of Kalinâriśvara. This temple has been recently demolished by the villagers, and the only portion of it that survives is a sculptured stone which bears the figure of a kneeling elephant, above the elephant a hauda with a stout male person realizing in it, and the single word śri-Kalindrai in Pallava-Grantha characters (No. 376 of 1902). It may perhaps be concluded from this, that the demolished temple of Iśvara (Siva) Waa built by a Pallava king named Kalinārai, and that the man riding on the elephant is meant to represent this king. 
According to the subjoined Tamil inscriptions, the ancient name of Tirunåmanallar was Tirundvalûr. The Saiva saint Sundaramürti, who was born at Tirunávalůr and was the protégé of a chief of that place, derived from it the surname Nåvalûraß, which he applies to himself in some of his bymna. Tirana valûr belonged to the district of Muņaippadi (C. below) or Tirumunaippadi (A. and B. below). In the time of Råjendra-Chó!a I. it bore the surname Raja dittaddvapuram, which is due to the fact that its temple had been founded by Råjåditya, and was included in Mêlûr-nidu, & subdivision of Tirumugaippadi, a district of Jayangonda Chola-mangalam (F. below). 
The gubioined inscriptions contain the names of a few other villages in the neighbourhood of Tiranåmanallür. Of these, Sevalai in Venpainallûr-nadu (C. below) survives in the two villages Periyasevalai and Singaševalais (i.e. great and small Sepalai') close to Tiruvennai pallur. Ekadhird-chaturvedimadgalam (D. below) cannot be identified, as it is not the name, but the surname of some village. Arumbakkam (E. below) is situated 2 miles south of 
Tirukoilur. 
A..INSCRIPTION OF PARANTAKA I. This inscription (No. 335 of 1902) is dated in the 28th year of "Parakesarivarman who took Madirai (Madhura)," k.e. of the Chola king Parantaka 1.8 who ruled from about A.D. 900 to about 940.7 It records the gift of two lamps by a servant of Kôkkilanadi, tbe queen of Parantuka I. and the mother of his son Råjådityadova. 'The latter is the Råjaditya who, nooording to the large Leyden grants and the Atakûr inscription of A.D. 949-50,9 was killed in battle by the Râshtrakuta king Krishna III.

C.-INSCRIPTION OF KRISHNA III. This inscription (No. 362 of 1902) is dated in the 17th year of Kannaradova, 1.e. of the Rashtrakúta king Krishna III., the conqueror of the Pallava and Chôļs countries. It records the gift of a lamp by a chief of Miladu, named Narasimhavarman and surnamed Saktinatha and Siddhavadava. He claims to belong to the lineage of śukra and to the Malaiyakula, he. the family of the rulers of Malaiyanadu or Malainádu, of which Miladu and Malddu are contracted forms. According to the Pariyapuranam, the capital of this district was Tirukkóvalûr (Tirukoilur), the head-quarters of the present Tirukoilur taluka. The chiefs of Malainâdu claimed connection with the Châdi family. They had the custom of prefixing the name of the reigning Chola king to their title. Thus, six inscriptions of Rajendra-Chola I., Kulôttnóga-Chóļa and Vikrama-Chôļa at Kilûr near Tirukoilur (Nos. 241, 260, 284, 285, 286 and 290 of 1902) mention Miladudaiyån råman Mummaţi-Chôlag alias Rajendra-Chôļa Miladudaiyán, Kițiyura Malaiyaman Kulôttanga-Chồla-Chêdiyariyag, and Kiļiyûr Malaiyaman Vikrama-Chóla-Chèdiyarayan, the father of Vikrama-Chðla-Kovalarayan; and in two inscrip tions of Tribhuvanachakravartir Rajarajadêva and Kulôttunga-Chôļaddva (Nos. 288 and 293 of 1902) we find Kiliyur Malaiyamân Râlja]raja-Chèdiyarayan. 
The Trivikrama-Perumal temple at Tirukoilur bears an inscription of the sixth year of Parakesarivarman alias Rajendradêva, i.e. A.D. 1057-589 or about a centary after the present record. It belongs to a later chief of Miladu, whose name was likewise Narasimha varman, He resided at Tirukkôyalar (Tirukoilur), was a descendant of the lineage of Bhârgava (1.6.

The inscription D records the gift of a lamp by a Muhaiyadiyaraiyan, i.e. a chief of the district of Muņai or Muhaippadi, in which Tirunâmanallûr was included. The chief of the people of Munai' (Mumuiyar kon) is mentioned as a vassal of Vikrama-Chôla in the Vilckor, ama-Sölan Ulů.? According to the Periyapurinant, the Saiva saint Sundaram ürti was the protégé of another chief of Tiramugaippadi (Munaiyaralyar), named Narasimha, who resided at Tirunavalûr (Tirunamanallar), and who is himself considered one of the sixty-three Tiruttopdar or devotees of Siva.

No. 20.-FOURTEEN INSCRIPTIONS AT TIRUKKOVALUR. 
Br E. HULTZSCH, P#.D. Tirukkovalûr is the head-quarters of a tâluka of the South Arcot district. It contains & Vishņu temple named Trivikrama-Perumal, and the suburb of Kilůr a Siva temple named Virattåndsvara. Of the subjoined inscriptions, ten (A, to J.) are in the Siva temple and four (K. to N.) in the Vishnu temple. 
The sacred writings of the Saivas and Vaish avas of the Tamil country mention both of the Tirukkoyalûr temples. Tiruñâņasambandar refers to the Siva temple as * Virattapam at Kövalûr, 8 and Tirumangai-Âļvâr to the Vishnu temple as 'Idaikali at Kôvalûr.' The sub joined inscriptions have the forms Tiruvirattâņam (A. to J.) and Tiruvidaikali (K.) or Idai kali (L.). Tirukkovalûr (A, to C., E. to K.) or Kôval (L.) bore in the time of the Chôļa dynasty the surname Madurântaka-chaturvêdimangalam (K.). It was included in Kurukkai kurram, & subdivision of Malådu or Miládu,a district of 2,000 (villages), which in the time ryf the Chôļas was surnamed Jananátha-yalanadu (K.). 
The subjoined inscriptions incidentally mention three villages, vix. Upangalpuņdi (G.), Nenmali and Sirgiñjûr (H.). Of these, I can only identify the second, which is the modern Nemali.&

It records the gift of a lamp by a concubine of Vánakövaraiyar. This was probably the title of the chief of Vånakóppadi or Vånagappadi, a district which according to other inscriptions (No. 40 of 1887-88 and No. 126 of 1900) included Tiruyannamalai on the norther bank of the Pennai. A later Våpakovaraiyar is referred to in an inscription of Kulottuuga 13 and another Yanakðvaraiyan in one of Kulõttunga III. (No. 72 of 1890).

EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. 
No. 21.-TWO FURTHER INSCRIPTIONS OF TAHMCSIDDHI. 
By H. LÜDERS, PH.D. ; GÖTTINGEN. A TIRUVORRIYUR INSCRIPTION OF SAKA-SAMVAT 1129. The subjoined inscription is engraved on the east wall of the second priku?? Ådhipuriśvara temple at Tiravorriyûr in the Saidâpôt tåluka of the Chinglepit district.* The excellent inked estampages from which it is edited here were supplied to ine by its Hultzsch. 
The inscription consists of 26 lines in Grantha characters which vary in size from 1 to The language is Sanskpit, and the whole text is in yerse. With regard to orthography it has be noted that the engraver has followed the common practice of the time in this part of the country, in writing a surd consonant instead of a sonant before a sonant, in potnza (1h. I, 3), drikbhyam (1. 3), utbhavati (1. 8), ushatbudha (1. 13), and bhavatbhir (1, 25). Izntorld of usluudbudha lexicographers teach usharbudha, and this form is actually found in the Uttarit rūmacharitu (6, 44). Nevertheless I do not venture to alter ushatbudha into ustarbudhat, als that Würd ocours again in exactly the same shape in line 15 of the Aruļāļa-Perumal inscription of Tammasiddhi (B. below), and under these circumstances a merc clerical error seems to be out of the question. 
The inscription is one of king Tammusiddhi or Tammusiddha, and in every respect closely resembles the two inscriptions of that chief which I have edited above, p. 119 ff. I have pointed oat already on that occasion that the present inscription is of some importance as settling the question of the relationship of Dáyabhima and Nallasiddhi, which was left undetermined by the other two recorda. Besides, the genealogical portion of the inscription contains sevon new reises, three of which, however, are of no interest for the historian as they are merely in praise of some well-known heroes of the solar line from which Tammusiddhi claimed descent, víz. Kagha (v. 8), Dašarathe (F. 9), and Råma (. 10). Verse 12 also, which alludes to the feath of the ancient Chola king Kalikala, adds nothing to our knowledge as it is an almost literal equivalent of the corresponding verse in the other two inscriptions. The verses 26 and 27 are enlogies of Tammasiddhi after the usual fashion, 
The only new yerse of historical value is yerse 15, which introduces a king Betta as a descendant of Madhurânta ka Pottappi-Ohola and an ancestor of Tilungavidya or, as he is called bere (v. 16), 'Tilungabijja. Literally translated, the verse rans thus: " In this family Wula born (a king) called Betta, who was the crusher of the thunderbolt whose flight pas impelled by Sakra; if he with his fiery splendour had risen before, the cutting of the wings of the mountains also would not have taken place." Betta is here compared to Agni, the fire or the fire-god, who has the reputation of being able to split diamonds and thunderbolts. Aa Betta, 
* No. 104 of the Government Epigraphist's collection for the year 1892. 
The writing ushadbadha is perhaps due to the influence of Tamil phonology. As in Tamil & Sanskrit dental generally assumes the sound of , before a labial (compare e.9. Tamil urpatti « Sanskrit utpatti and Tamil ayoudan Sanskrit adbhutan), I think it not unlikely that the r of wharbudka also was looked at # 2 Becondary souad and therefore erroneously converted into d or t. 
& It will be noticed that the term tad-bahenjah in verse 11 of the Tiruppåfür inscription is replaced hero (v. 20) by the words asy=dnsjah. 
See especially a passage in the Uttarardmacharita (6,4"), pointed out to me by Prof. Kielhom tohohlarda-vajra-khand-dparpota-paru. .. waharbudhat, the fire. .. which is able to split into pieces the exceedingly hard poras,' In this case, it is true, tajra would naturally suggest the meaning i diamond; but an vajra has also the meaning of thunderbolt, and as the thunderbolt is thought to be of the name substance with the diamond, it is easy to understand how later writers came to credit the fire also with the faculty of destroying thunderbolts.

TWO FURTHER INSCRIPTIONS OF TAMMUSIDDHI. 
149 
however, is not a legendary person to whom purely fictitious exploits such as a fight with Indra might be iscribed, it is evident that the words Sakra-chôdita-gatêr aśanéh prahartå must be understood in a double sense and as referring to some historical event. We are thus led to take Asani as a proper name and to translate "who defeated Asani whose march had been ordered by Sakra. In this case Asani would seem to have been the general of a king called Sakra or Indra ; but it is perhaps even more probable, as suggested to me by Prof. Kielhorn, that Sakra-chôdita-gati is the Sanskrit rendering of some Tamil or Telugu biruda of Asani, just as Ašani itself may be the Sanskrit equivalent of some Dravidian name. Who this Asani was, I am unable to tell ; but it can be shown, at any rate, that proper names or birudas with the meaning of 'thunderbolt' are by no means uncommon in Southern India. Pagåppidugu, 'the thunderbolt which cannot be split,' was the surname of the Pallava Mahendravarman I. Among the ancestors of the Chôla chief Srîkantha appears an Agranipiduga, 'the thunderbolt to the foremost (of his enemies), and in the inscriptions of the Perumal temple at Poygai we find four times a certain Sambuvariyan who bore the birtda Virasani, the thunderbolt to heroes.'3 To these may be added Piduva råditya, the biruda of Malla II., one of the chiefs of Velanâņķu, as the first member of the compound seems to be connected with pidugu.* 
The object of the grant is to record that in the Saka year denoted by the chronogranz Dhirayâyin, .e. 1120 (=A.D. 1207-8), Tammusiddhi allotted to the god, the lord of Adhipuri, all the revenue due to the king in the villages belonging to the temple, Adbipuri is an attempt of Sanskritizing Tiruvorriyûr, the name of the village where the temple is situated.5

TRANSLATION.1 (Verse 8.) In his (1.c. Manu's) family was Raghu who was fed by the milk of Surabhi which had become the cause of procreation. Is it surprising, under these ciroumstances, that he should have performed a sacrifice at which (his) whole property was given away, (and) that he should have conquered also all the quarters ?% 
(V. 9.) Then there was in his family Pańktira tha, who, by the exploits of (his) arm protecting for a long timo (both) Amaravatî and this earth, kept, of his own accord, (the one) free frona demons (and the other sprinkled) with the water of donations. 
(V.10.) From him was born, under the name of Rama, Hari full of valour," who, having killed in battle the lord of the Rakshasas who was injuring all (beings) through his) arrogance (awakened by the conquest) of (Indra's) heaven, took back his queen, after she had emerged in purity from the fire which she had entered, as the narrow digit of the moon (emerges ayuin in old splendour) from the sun after it has entered it,& and went to (haa) capital. 
(V. 12.) In this family was born Kalikâla-Ohola, the hero who supplied with banks the daughter of Kavēra,? When (Mount) Mêru had been merely touched by his play-staff, it began to shake and thereby) caused a confusion among the quarters. 
(V. 15.) In this family was born (à king) called Betta, who was the crusher of the thunder bolt whose flight was impelled by Sakra ;8 if he with his fiery splendour had risen before, the cutting of the wings of the mountains also would not have taken place. 
1 Only the verges which are not found in the Tiruvalaågadu and Tiruppasar inscriptions have been translated here. Verse 29 algo has been omitted, because, apart from the name of the god, it is identical with verse 21 of the Tiru välangâdu inscription. 
s According to the Raghuvania (II. 69 ff.) Raghu was conceived by Sudakshiņa, after her huaband Dilipa had drunk from the milk of the cow Nandini, the daughter of Surabhi, and not of Sarabbi herself as itaplied by the Terbe of the inscription. Raghu's digvijaya and his performance of the Visvajit sacrifice are narrated in the fourth Targa of the Raghuvansa ; compare with our verse especially IV. 86:- sa Tisvajitam djanr. yaghan sardasid. daktakiyam, 
* I.e. Dasaratha. * The term tikrama is used with reference also to the three strider of Vishnu. 
Räpano's conquest of Indra's beaven is told in the Randyana, VII. 27 ..

BARULALA-PERUMAL INSCRIPTION OF SAKA-SAMVAT 1127. This inscription, which I edit from inked estampages supplied to me by Dr. H ultzsch, is engraved at the base of the north wall of the stone platform called the mountain ' (9720lco) in the Aruļaļa-Perunas temple at Conjeeveran,3 
It is written in Grantha characters which vary in height from *" to 11". Up to line 15, medial ai is expressed in the usual manner by putting the two spirals side by side ; see tasmar (1.1), sainya (1. 1), gunair (1. 7), sambhavair (1.8), kirttyai (1.9), svairan (1. 10), yair (1. 12). But in the second half of the inscription the two signs are put one above the other; $co asyrAirasidhdns- (1. 16), yair (1. 17), tējónayair (1. 17), rijair=nnayanais (1.17), -dsmur Fastisailésvaraya (1. 20), alchilair (1. 20), jatálair=mmakutair (. 21). The language is Sanskrit, and, with the exception of a short passage in 11. 19 and 20, the whole text is in verse. The spelling of the words patma (11. 1, 3, 4), Valmikivat bhânz- (1. 9), abhtet bizuj-ápadcinena (1. 9), utbhavati (1. 10), ushatbudha* (1. 15), spháyat-yhümné (1. 20), prádát granam (1. 20), bhavatbhir (1. 20) is in agreement with the practice followed in similar Grantha inscriptions. The group dd) is written dhdh in - Airasidhdhi and rôdhdhum in line 16. 
This is another record of king Tammusiddhi. It enriches our knowledge by incidentally mentioning the surname of Tammusiddhi's father, Erasiddhi, and the time and place of Tammusiddhi's inauguration. This information is found in 1. 19 f. where it is recorded that in the Sake year 1127 (=A.D. 1205-6) king Tammusiddhi, the son of Gandagôpala and Sridevi, the younger brother of the great king Manmasiddhi, having performed his anointment in the town of Nellûr, presented the village of Muttiyampâkka, the head-quarters of Pantarashtra, to the god, the lord of Hastiśaila. Nellûr is the modern Nellore, the chief town of tho district of that name. Muttiyampakka and the district of Pantarashtra I am unable to identify. The temple of the lord of Hastiśaila, i.e. the elephant mountain,' is the Arnlâla. Perumal temples where the inscription is engraved. 
Except these data, the inscription contains nothing of historical value which is not known to us from the previously published records of Tammusiddhi, the four verses (4, 8, 9, 12) which here appear for the first time being nerely eulogies of the king's mythical ancestors : Brahman. Sagara, Bhagiratha and Kuća. Perhaps it is worth mentioning that Tiluågavidya and Nallasiddhi are omitted in the genealogy, and that the name Betta is here constantly spelt: Vetta (TY, 17, 19, 24). • 
I re Abalva, whom Indra tried to seduce. When Gautama became aware of his intention, he cursed the cod. in consequence of which Indra's body was covered with a thousand eyes. 
The ides which forms the theme of this verse is rather far-fetched. Tudra, being eager to listom to Tammngiddhi's praise, wants to have a thousand ears. He therefore looks again for Gautama's wife, honin by a new curse of the sage he will get as many eara as be has got eyes.

TRANSLATION, (Verse 4.) From this (lotus) arose that Padmasana, who, having accumulated the power of rajas, because he had dwelt long in its interior, 6 accomplished the creation of the animate and inanimate world, (and) who, in order to create companions, seemed to produce many creators, when he touched the images reflected in the jewels of the hoods of the snake (which formed) the couch of the husband of Sri.? 
(V. 8.) Then there was in his (1.e. Mann's) family an illustrious ruler of the earth, king Sagara, who by his own sons made the ocean an everlasting receptacle of the aggregate of Chis) fame.

This is a single copper-plate, about 1' 8" broad by l'"high, and inscribed on one side only. Judging from the impressions, a seal was soldered on to the middle of the proper right side of the plate, just as is the case with the Banskhêra plate of Harsha and the three plates of the Maharajas of Mahodaya," but it must have got detached from the plates and has not been disonvered. In the upper part and on the proper left side the plate has suffered somewhat from corrosion, but the writing throughout is so deeply engraved that on the back of the impressions every letter of the 18 lines which the plate contains may be read with absolute certainty. The Bize of the letterg is about it. The characters belong to the north-western class of alphabets ; in general, they closely resemble those given (from the Lakkhå Magsal inscription, North. Inscr. No. 600) in colamns xy. and xvi. of Table IV. of Professor Bühler's Ind. Palcographie. Of initial vowels tihe text only contains a (c.g. in anayôræ, 1. 15); i (e.g. in 100, 1. 6), the form of which, employed here, iu Professor Bühler's Table occurs only in much later insoriptions; # (in 
1 The words used of Kumudvati are selected with reference to the original moaning of that name. Kumod ratt is likened to a group of lotuses (kumuddatd) growing in a pond (Saraseh praridhd), which open their blossoms (vikastar-dngt) when touched by the beams (kara-sparsam avdpya) of the moon. The marriage of Kose and Kamudrati, the sister of the æerpent Kumuda, is told in the sixteenth warga of the Raghuvania. 
a According to Dr. Führer, Monumental Antiquities and Insoriptions in the N.-W. Provinoer and Oudha, p. 189, where the above information is given, the village of Madhuban is 82 miles north-east of Azamgarh ; but I bave not found the name in the Indian Atlas, sheet No. 103. 
* Some of the errors which Prof. Bühler's text contains were corrected by him, when editing the Banakhora plate of Harsha, above, Vol. IV. p. 208 1. 
See above, Vol. IV. p. 208, and Vol. V. p. 208. & Compare the sonpat seal of Harthavardhana, Gupta Incr. p. 281, and Plate.. 
• The apparently more antique manner in which essentially the same alphabet was written in Eastern India may be seen from the plates of the time of salaó kardja (above, VOL VI. p. 144, Plate) which are only about ten year older than this Madhuban plate.

Of the consonants, gh, dh aud I do not co cich, jh, si and th arc only found as subscript letters, c.g. iu tach-chlásenaril, . 10, uy3D sijña-, l. 15, and jyështha., 1. 13. Regarding the other signs it may be noted that five of k, g, W, 9 and s-ivhen they have no subscript letters, have a small hook at the bottoin unagakaras, l. 16, tadita, 1. 10, nu sunt löslich-, l. 19); and attention may also be dia foring of W (eg. in kara-, l. 15), 1 (eg, in sôdrangah, 1. 11), o (e.g. iu ohanchaldym (e.g. iu pataldo, l. 17), d (eg. in duran, l. 16), ph (in phalan, 1. 16), and v (e.g, in SW E l. 14). The superscript sign for y is sometimes Tritten above, and sometimes on, tho bide: ?? There it follows upou anotlier consonant, is always denoted by the secondary, subscript! even in the conjunct ry (e.g. in paryantak, 1. 11). The ordinary form of the subsci'ipt t hey be seen from the sthú of reijastunayren, 1. 9; the same form is used in the conjzinot ratlus Link samprinitúrthi., 1. 5, but the ful] form of tha is exceptionally employed in the st 1210 OF $7. pastha anuit, 1. 15. The subscript forn of n does not differ from the sign for 720 ; sed lige Savarré, . 19, and Tishquvriddha-, 1. 1. Apparenily in order to distinguish clearly between the subscript dh and y, the latter is denoted by a peculiar triangular sign; compare e.g. the ". of -bhivriddhaye, 1. 13, with the tu of -igrahûratvérus, 1. 14. The only final consonant which ccouis is the t of the word samrat in line 18; it is denoted by the lutver part of the sigu fon tits with it separate horizontal line abote it. As regards medial vowels, only the signs for tu ani 26 call for remarks. The ordinary sigu for it (ful for the di of já) may be seen e.g. in mahüra jailliz sija-, 1. 12. When a follows upou ti, , or . or a conjunct beginning with one of these consonants, it is longtel by & murs line plocodi vertically above the sign for 1, & ON mi see e.g. bha ilotuii, 1, 1), lilentfifrakas, 1. 13, aur! Okarañáicłhin, at the end of line 17. In the same way d is denoted in the lih yiê of sandkiyetan, 1. 17 (compare with it the khi of vinukháḥ, 1. 7), and in the use at the commencement of line 10 (compare with it the jñi of djña, 1. 15). Excepting in tho syllable 7# (for which see Varin., 1, 5), the vowel u is either denoted by a subscript vertical line-or prolongation of the Tertical line of the consonant-siga ending with a small hook, or by a sign which resombles the subscript u of the modern Nagari alphabet. The former way of denoting it is followed in writing the aksharas chchhrá, shnzi, len, 124, pu, n2t, yt, vu, deu and su, the latter in ki, tkıt, qu: tak, str aurl bhu; compare vichchhurita-, l. 4, dushta-, l. 6, sumuchita-, 1. 15, and talya-, l. 15, Skandagaptah, l. 17, cto. F'or two ways of writing the medial - tho ono fullofveit only in it, and the other in ki, gal and bhů - compare důtakó, 1.17, and la 0-, 1. 10. The inscription doos not contain the sigus of the j shvimúliya, upauhmaniya and avagraha; but in line 18 it has three numerical symbols, for 20, 5 and 6. The symbol for 20 is like the a/shart thor ; that for 5 looks like tri, with the sign of the medial d attached to it; and the symbol for 6 vesomliles the akshara di rith a subscript at. Signs of punctuation are used in the text three Times, in lines 16 and 17. Throughout the writer has formed the letters Trith great care and skill.--- The language of the inscription is Sanskṣit. Any unusual or rare words and technical terms which it contains will be drawn attention to in the notes on the translation. The text generally is in prose, but it contains a verse in lines 6 and 7, and two benedictive and imprecatory Terses-- in one of which the kivg Harsha himself is referred to as an authority for the sentiment expressed in lines 16 and 17. In respect of orthography it need only be stated that the sign for v devotes both v and b, that k and t are generally doubled before r (e.g. in puttrasa, 1. 1, and -áték kr&utan, 1. 3, but not in pravritta-chakra, l. 3), and that now and then the rules of saidhí bave pot been observede

that 
century A.D. by which the village of Sômakundaken in the Kundadhani vishaya of the Sråvasti bhukti, which had been previously held by a Brahmap on the strength of a forged charter, was granted to tvo other Brahmaņs. The king's order was issued from the royal residence or camp of Kapitthika (1.1), and is dated on the 6th of the dark half of the month Märgasirsha of the year 25 (apparently of the king's reign). The actual order is preceded by the genealogy vs Harsha, in the course of which it is stated that his immediate predecessor, his elder brother Rajyavardhana, after defeating Dêvagupta and other kings, was treacherously slain in his enemy's quarters. On this event and on the genealogy generally it is now unnecessary to comment. 
Of tho localities mentioned in the inscription, Kapittbikå apparently is the Kie-pi-tha (Kapittha) of Hiuen-Tsiang, which, again, is the same as Sâmkaśya, identified by the late Sir Au Cunninghams with the modern Sankisa,' on the Kâlinadi river, about 40 miles north-West of Kanauj. And Srêvasti, after whiob the Srävasti-bhukti was called, is the modern Sallet Mahets in the Conda district of Oudh. Kundadhani, from which the Kundadhani-vishaya received its name, and the village of Sômakundaka havo not been identibe.

Begotten on Mahagênaguptâ dévi, his son, who nuditatel on his feet, (was) the devout worshipper of the Sun, the Paramabhnțțâruku Mamrüjahinija Prabhikaravardhana, whosez faune crossed the four oceans; before whom other kings bowel down on account of his prowess and out of affection for him ; who wielded his power for the due maintenance of the castes and orders of life, (and) who, like the suu, l'elieved the distress of the people. Begotten on the queen of spotless fane Yaśômati, his son, who meditated on his foet, (was) the devout worshippor of Sugata (Buddha)-like Sugata solely delighting in the welfare of others the Paramallrattetryka Mahirajadhiraja Rajyavardhana (II.), the teniluils of those bright fame Overspread the whole orb of the earth; who appropriated the glory of Dhanada. Varupa, India and the other guardian (deities) of the world; who gladdened the hearts of suppliants by many donations of woalth and land acquired in righteous ways, (und) who surpassed the conduct of former kings. 
He in battle curbed Dévagupta and all the other kings together, like vicious horses madea to turn away from the lashes of the whip, Eaviny uprooted his adversaries, having conquerert tho earth, having acted kindly towards the people, he throagh his trust in promisest lost his life in the ononny's quarters.

(1. 10.) Be it known to you! Isaving ascertained that this village of Sômakundaka was held by the Brâhman Vámarathya on the strength of a forged charter, I therefore have broken that charter and taken.

Compare Gupta Inscr. p. 220, lines 1 and 2 of the text. 
* The word for * sun,' employed in the original on account of the preceding -pravritto-chakra, is bkachakra ratha, whose chariot has only one wheol'; compare for it e.g. in the thir Act of the Ratnd all the verge commen cing with adlavonci n-aikaohakrah prabharati, and Mayurt's Süryakata a, v. 59 (where the Sun saY8 : #avi rata yati ma m ailachakrah). For the idea that the sun relieves distress, compare o.g. Gupta Inscr. p. 162, toxt, L 2 
8 The Gerund Weritud of the original text is employed, in an unugual way, to convey & passive sense; ' like vicious horses (curbed) after they have been made to turn away from the lashes of the wbip.' In Prakrit we do ind passiye Gerunde; comparo e.g. O rjiu janti ( - blanktod yanti), they run away after having been broken,' in Prof. Pischels Materialien xur Kenntnis des Apabhramsa, p. 23. For Sanskrit I can only quote, from the Dalakumaraoharita, Mion upakritya pratyupakpitaoatt bhavdyam, where the Gerund upakritya must mean 'after having been favoured. * 
• According to the Harshacharita, - allured to confidence by false civilities on the part of the king of Gaudas Ree Prof. Cowell and Mr. Thomas's Translation, p. 178.

In Farukitaka the suffix ka has been added to Bhuktan momen as noted already by Prof. Bühler, through the influence of the Pråkrit without altering the meaning of bhakta (svarthé); compare Prof. Alsohal's Grammatik dor Pradorit-Sprachem, $ 598.

TIRUVENDIPURAM INSORIPTION OF RAJARAJA III.

Cuddalore (Kudallir), the head-qunriers of the South Arcot district. It consists of 9 lines in the Tamil alphabet and language and forms a single big sentence, which can, however, be dissolved into several distinct periods with the help of the gerunda kétfu, 'having heard, in lino, and 
prd, having said,' in lines 3 and 4. The pronoun 120nokkun,' to us,' in line I shows that the subject of the passage beginning in line 4 is the plural of the pronoun of the first person. 
The language exhibits for peculiaritier. The letters d and d are doubled after a nasal in vind da (1.1), Sinddu" (1.2) and eduuddet (1.). Instund of the gerund kondri (twice in 1, 6, and 1.8), the poetical form lodu occurs four times (ll. 2, 3, 4 and 9). Arutlevitty (11. Hand 9), aruliviloka (1. 9) and veggivitt (1. 7) are vulgar forms of aruluvittu, eta. 
This inscription is distinguished frou must other South-Indian inscriptions, as it does not record a donation or similar transaction, but is of a purely historical character. It is dated in the 16th year of Tribhuvancichulrarurtin Râjara jadêve (1. 1) and must have been cngraved at the instance of tio military officers (danzálikna), named Appaña and Samudra-Goppayas (1,5), in the service of the Boysana (or Hoydala) king Vira-Narasimhadeva (1.1). This king had heard that Kôpperuăjinga had captured the Chola eraperor at sendamangalam. Anxious to vindicate his title “the establisher of the Chola ocuntry,' he started from Dôrasamudra and conquered the Maba[ra] kingdom. When at Pâchchûr, he ordered the two above-mentioned officers to continue the campaign. They advanced through the enemy's country until they reached. sendamangalam, forced Kopperuñjinga to release the Chola emperor, and accompanied the latter into his dominions. 
The title 'establisher of the Chola countıy,' which the inscription applies to Vira-Nára simhadeya (1, 3), and the statement that he conquered the Mahara kingdom, show that this king is identical with the Hoysala Narasimha II, who in several inscriptions is styled' the establisher of the Chola kingdom' and 'the uprooter of the Makara ar Magara kingdom.' As the inscriptions of Narasinuha II. are dated between AD. 1222 and 1284, it follows that the king Rajaraja, to whose 16th year the subjoined inscription belongs (1.1), is the Chola king RAjaraja III., who ascended the throne in A.D. 1216,5 and whose leth year accordingly corresponded to A.D. 1231-32. He is no doubt identical with the Chola emporor' who was captured and released at Søndamangalain. The dates of other inscriptions of Rajaraja III. show that he continued to reiga afler his re-installation, His latest known date is A.D. 1243-44 in an inscription at Poygai. 
The subjoined inscription mentions a considerable number of geographical dames. Dôras&paudra, the capital of Narasimha II., is the modern Halebių in the Balûr táluka of the Hassan district in the Mysore State. Pâchchûr, where he halted on his expedition against Kopperuñjinga (1. 4), is perhaps identical with a village of that name in the Trichinopoly taluka, opposite to the island of Srirangam, 2 mileg north of the Coleroon river, and 9 miles west by south of Kanpaşûr, the southern capital of Narasitisha's #ucocskor Sömesyura.? If this identifica tion of Pachchûr is correct, it would follow that Narasimha II. left his dominions by way of the Gajalbatti pass, and that the Mahara (Makara or Magara) kingdom (1.3) has to be looked for in the Coimbatore or Salem district. In the course of the expedition which Appaña and Samudra-Goppaya undertook against Köpperusjinga, they first destroyed the villages of Elleri, Kalliyürmülai and Toludagaiyûr (1, 5). Then they worshipped the god nt Poggambalam

(1. 6 f.), destroyed Toņdaimagallur, and halted at Tiruppådirippuliyar (1.7). Next they destroyed Tiruvadigai and Tiruvekkarai (1. 7) and the conntry between the Varanayiši riyer in the north, Sendamangalam in the west, and the sea in the east (l. 8). As far as the route of Narasimha's two officers can be followed on the map, it appears that they crossed the present South Arcot distriot from south to north. Elleri and Kalliyûrmilai (now Kaliyemalai) are in the southern portion of the Chidambaram tåluka. Pogpambalam is one of the Tamil names of Chidambaram itself. Tondaimâ pallar is perhaps the modern Tondamånattam in the Cudda Iore tâluka, and Tiruppådirippuliyûr is the well-known ancient name of Tirupåpuliyür, a rail. way station north of Cuddalore. Tiruvadigai is Tiruvadit near Panruttis and Tiruvekkarsi is Tiruvakkarai in the Villupuram (Viluppuram) taluka. As regards Sendamangalam,' where Köppernājiäga kept the Chola king prisoner, and at the gates of which the war seems to have ended the Postal Directory of the Madras Circle nentions no less than eighteen villages of this name, three of which belong to the South Arcot district. The Sendama galam which is intended here is probably the one in the Tirukcilar (Tirukkovalûr) tâlnka.8 I am unable to identify the Våranayasi river, which has to be looked for to the north of Sendamangalam, and the village of Toludagaiyür, which must have been situated south of Chidambaram. It is not clear why Appana and Samudra-Goppaya selected the temple of Tirıyêndipuram for engraving this account of their achievements. Perhaps it was at this village that they took leave of the Chola king Rajaraja III., whom they had rescued from the hands of Kopperaõjinga at Śêndamadgalam. 
As far as we know at present, Narasimha II. was the first among the Hogaala kings who possessed a portion of the Triohinopoly district. In an inscription on a várakat, dated in A.D. 1222,10 he is stated to be “marching against the Range in the South," h.e. the island of Srirangam, and in the Harihar inscription of A.D. 122411 he is already called the uprooter of the Makara kingdom' and the establisher of the Chola kingdom.' Hence his conquest of Srirangam seems to have taken place between A.D. 1222 and 1224. This first invasion of the Makara and Chola kingdoms was distinct from and prior to the conquest of the same two king doms which is related in the Tiruyêndipuram inscription, and it is presupposed by the wording of the latter, which implies that the king started on his new campaign in order to vindicate his previously earned title 'establisher of the Chôļa country. A further testimony to Narasimha's infidence in the Chồla country is supplied by an inscription in the Gökarnêsvara temple at Tirugôkarņam near Padakkottai (No. 410 of 1902), which is dated in the [1]0th year of Tribhuvanachakravartin Rajarajadêva, 42. A.D. 1225-26, and records a grant of land by a servant of Sômaladevi,12 the wife of Sömégvaradeva, the son of the Pôśaļa king Vira-Nårugimhadhva of

Dôrasamudra. Finally, a mutilated inscription in the Ranganatha temple at Srirangam (No. 54 of 1892), dated in A.D. 1233, records a grant by a female relation of Bhujabala Bhimakléaya-Dandanayaka, the great minister (mahápradhana) of Pratápachakravartin Pošala fri-Vira-Narasimhaddva. 
Among the opponents of Narasimha II., the Harihar inscription of A.D. 1224 and the Basaraļu inscription of A.D. 1234 mention the Kådava king and the Pân ya king, and three inscriptions state that "his valour caused the reduction of the Pandya sovereignty." As will appear below (p. 164 and note 3), Kopperuõjinga claimed to belong to the Kâçava or Pallava family. If he is meant by the expression 'Kadaya king' in the Harihar inscription, it would follow that he had come into hostile contact with Narasimha II. before the time of the Tiruvêndi puram inscription, perhaps on the occasion of Narasimha's first attack on Srirangam between A.D. 1222 and 1224. The Pandya contemporary of Narasimha II. Was Maravarman alias Bundara-Pandya I., who, as shown by Professor Kielhorn, ascended the throne in A..D. 1216, This king boasts on his part to have conquered the Chô!a country and to have restored it to the Chola king; and an inscription of his 9th year, i.e. A.D. 1225, is actually found in the Ranganatha temple at Srirangam, while we have seen that Narasimha II. was marching against Srirangam in A.D. 1222. 
Among the partisans of Köpperuñjiöga, the inscription mentions two chiefs named Sõlakon? (1. 5) and Kolli-Solakón (1. 6). Viraganganâdalvân and Chiņattarayan are stated to have been killed and are called officers of the king. Apparently, they were originally in the service of Rajaraja III. and had gone over to Köpperuõjinga. Of special interest is the statement that "four officers inoluding Parâkramabahu, the king of Ilam," were killed. What the author wants to say is perhaps " Parâkramababu and thrce of his officers." Ilam is the Tamil name of Ceylon. According to Wijesinha's Translation of the Mahavansa (page xxiv. ff.), Parikramabahu I. died in A.D. 1197 and Parákramabahu II. in A.D. 1275, and neither of them fell in battle. Hence the Parâkramabâhu of this insoription must be different from both ; per haps he was not a king, but a prince of Ceylon. 
Köpperuñjinga, the person who was responsible for Narasimha's interference in the affairs of the Ohôla kingdom, is first mentioned in an inscription of the Vriddhagirisvara temple at Vriddhichalam (No. 136 of 1900), the head-quarters of a tâluka in the South Arcot district. This record opens as follows:

From this inscription we learn that Köpperusjinga claimed to belong to the Pallava family, and that in A.D. 1229-30, i.e. two years before the Tiruvendipuram inscription, he still ack2017 ledged Rajaraja III. as his sovereign.

This person is no doubt identical with the prince Nilagan garaiyar of the Vallam inscription, and his surname is a slight modification of Avaniy-dla-pperandar, the title of his father Köpperuõjingadêya. 
As stated on page 163 above, the Tiruyêndipuram inscription mentions among the partisans of Köpperuñjinga a certain Solakon. This person is probably identical with an officer whose namo occurs in most of the Chidambaram inscriptions of Kôppernñjiógadhya. In one inscription he is called "Peramâlppillai alias Solakóņår, (one) among his (viz. Kôpperuäjiägadeva's) officers, '* and in another (No. 462 of 1902) "the lord of Araśûr, Sengañivåyar alias Pillai Solakogår Âļigår." The grant portion of the Chidambaram inscriptions of the 3rd to 16th years opens with the words Solakón olai, .e. " the order of Solakón," and ends with the words ivai Solakór elutta, 2.c. “ this (is) the signature of Sôlakon." Accordingly, Solakón must have been the representative of Kôpperañjingadêya at Chidambaram until at least A.D. 1258-59. 
A short undated inscription at Tiruvêndipuram supplies the name of Solakôp's younger brother. This inscription (No. 146 of 1902) runs as follows imme

Vênådudaiyán seems to have succeeded his elder brother as officer in charge of Chidambaram. For, in two Chidambaram inscriptions of the 34th and 36th years of Kôppernñjingadêva (Nos. 461 and 456 of 1902), the grant portion opens with the words Têná dudaiyán ôlaz and ends with the words ivai Vånddudaiyan eluttu.

TIRUVENDIPURAM INSCRIPTION OF RAJARAJA III.

. M www.

A solitary Sanskrit record of Kopperuñjingadéra is found as far north as Dräkahgrâma in the Godavari district. Unfortunately this inscription (No. 419 of 1893) is so much mutilated that: no connected transcript of it can be given. It is dated in the Sake year 1184 and records gifts to the temple of Bhinanátha by the king, who is called Saltalabhuvandchakravarting Avany-utan-odbhava or Avany-arana-sanbhava, and Maharajasimha. The tvo names beginning with quoni are Sanskrit translations of his surname Avaniy-dla-ppirandár, Malârâjasimha means' the lion among great kings,' while Köpperuõjiőga would mean the great lion among kings. The Drâkabârâma inscription calls him the ornament of the Kathaka family and *& Worshipper of Kanakasabhadhinatha's He is stated to have defeated the Karnata* and Chola kings and to have established the Pandya country. The Kakati king and Ganapati-maharaja are also referred to in the Drakshârâma inscription. The first three lines contain two verses in the Bårdglavikridita metre, and the sixth line states that certain verses were composed by the king himself and inscribed on his gifts to the temple. 
It was stated in the preceding paragraph that Köpperusjingaddva claims to have established the Påądya country. On the other hand, an inscription of the Pandya king Jaţåvarman alias Tribhuvanachakravartin Sundara-Pandyadêve at Tiruppanduratti Asserts that this king " besieged the prosperons city of Sôndamangalam and fought several battles to frighten the Pellava."? This Pallava is evidently Kopperunjiðgadêva, and Sendama galam seems to have been his capital, as we might already conclude from the Tiruvêndipuram inscription, according to which Köpperuõjinga was besieged in Sendamangalam.

No. 24._DATES OF CHOLA KINGS. By F. KIELHORN, PH.D., D.LITT., LL.D., C.I.E.; GÖTTINGEN. 
(Continued from page 10.) Dr. Hultzsch again has sent me a large number of dates of Chola kings, of which I now publish twenty-three, with the results of my calculations. Of these, the dates Nos. 61-74 show that the times previously found for the commencements of the reigns of the five kings to whom they belong Rajaraja I., Rajendra-Chôļa I., Kulôttuúga-Ohôļa I., Vikrama-Chôļa, and Kalóttuiga-Chôļa III-are correct. The dates of Rajaraja III., Nos. 75-78, reduce the time during which this king must have commenced to reiga, to the period from (approximately) the 23rd June to the 13th August A.D. 1218. And the dates Nos. 79-83, belonging to Rajendra Chola III., of whom no dates had yet been examined, prove that this king commenced to reign between (approximately) the 21st March and the 8th May A.D. 1246. The remaining dates sent to me are very difficult to deal with; their publication will probably have to be deferred to the time when more dates of the kings to whom they belong have been discovered.

The date is intrinsically wrong because the nakshatra on the fourth tithi of a bright half in the month of Karkataka cannot bo Punarvast. The equivalent of the date apparently is Friday, the 23rd July A.D. 1042, which was the 28th day of the month of Karkataka and which was entirely occupied by the fourth tither of the bright half (of Śrîyana). The nakshatra on this day was Uttara-Phalgani, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 13 h. 8 m., and by the Brahma-siddhanta for 9 b. 51 m., after mean sunrise.

A date of the month of Mina of the 16th year of Kulottunga-Chôļa I. would be expected to fall in A.D. 1086, and in my opinion this date undoubtedly corresponds to Thursday, the 12th March A.D. 1086, which was the 19th day of the month of Mina, and on which the rakshatra was Uttarashadhá, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 16 h. 25 m., and by the Brahma-siddhanta for 9 h. 51 m., after mean sunrise. But the tithi which ended on this day, 10 h. 50 m. after mean sunrise, was the 9th, not the 10th tithi, of the dark half (of Phålguna).

A date of the month of Simha of the third year of Kulôttunga-Chola III. would be expected to fall in A.D. 1180, and in my opinion this date undoubtedly corresponds to the 12th August A.D. 1180, which was the 16th day of the month of Simba, and on which the 5th tithi of the dark half (of Srâvaņa) ended 9 h. 34 mn., while the nakshatra was Aśvini for 3 h. 17 mn., after mean sunrise.

Uuder the preceding date it has been stated that the nalishatra was Ašvini on the 16th day - the month of Siriha of the third year of the king's reign ; Aśvini therefore cannot have been the nakshatra on the 27th day of the same month. Nor would the weekday be correct; for the 27th day of Simha of the third year would be Saturday, the 23rd August A.D. 1180 (when the ww/cshatra was Uttara-Phalguns).I have not found any year of the reign of Kulottuvga ('hola III. for which the date would be correct.

The 26th day of the month of Simha of the 7th year of Kulôttuóga-Chôla III. corresponds to Wednesday, the 22nd August A.D. 1184. On this day the 14th tithi of the bright half (vof Bhadrapada) ended 18 h. 19 m., and the nakshatra was Satabhishaj, by the equal space system and according to Garga from 1 h. 19 m., and by the Brahma-siddhanta from 1 h. 58 m., after mean sunrise.

"In the 17th year of the reign) of the emperor of the the worlds, the glorious Kulátrunga-Choladêya, who was pleased to take Madurai and the crowned head of the Påndya, on the day of Röhini, which corresponded to a Thursday and to the thirteenth dithi of the second fortnight of the month of Mithuna." 
The date undoubtedly corresponds to Thursday, the 8th Juno A.D. 1105, which was the 13th day of the month of Mithuna, and on which the nakshatra wae Rôhiņi for 9h. 51 m.

As the 13th tithi of the dark half (of Jyaishţha) ended on this day only a minute or two after true sunrise, I should have expected the writer to quote the 14th tithi insteird of the 13th.

The date is intrinsically wrong because the nakshatra on the 9th tithi of a bright half in the month of Kavgå cannot be Hasta. The equivalent of the date apparently is Monday, the 2nd September A.D. 1196, which was the 6th day of the month of Kanga, and on which the 9th titha of the bright half (of Bhadrapada) ended 22 h. 22 n. after neun sunrise.

A date of the month of Rishabha of the 21st year of the reign of Kulôttuóga-Chôļa III. would be expected to fall in A.D. 1199, but for that year this date is incorrect, and I have not found any other year of the king's reign for which it would be correct. Such being the case, I feel certain that the month of Rishabha has been quoted erroneously instead of Mêsha.

surfaces, except the last, were raised into rims, to protect the writing. The outer side of the last plato, having no such rims, is somewhat worn; and a few letters there are more or legs illegible. But the rest of the record is in a state of very excellent preservation; and the text of it is quite clear and certain, throughout, except in one place in line 36.- The ring, on which the plates are strung, is about 1" thick and 45" in diameter. It has been cut; but it seems to be the same ring which was attached to the plates, and which had not then been cut, when the record first came under my observation, in 1877 or 1878. The seal, in which the ends of the ring are secured, is circular, about 3" in diameter. It has, in relief on a countersunk surface, across the centre, & boar, standing to the right (proper left), and the legend sri-Tribhuvan[i*]mku[sall, which presents a motto of the kings of the dynasty and means “the glorious elephant-goad of the three worlds:" the sa, which is considerably damaged, stands behind the boar, and the visarga is in frout of the boar; the rest of the legend is in one line above the boar. Above these, there is an elephant-goad, with the gun and moon above it. And, below the boar, there is a floral device, apparently an expanded water-lily shexing seven or eight petals. The characters belong to the southein class of alphabets, and are of the regular type of the locality and period to which the record belongs. They range in size from a little more than a to nearly . The engraving, though good, is not very deep; and, the plates being substantial, the letters do not shew through on the reverse sides. Marks of the working of the engrayer's tool can be seen in many places, both in the interiors of the letters, and in the copper which was pushed up by the tool at the sides of them; such marks on the sides of the letters, caused in the same way, can be seen very clearly in the lithograph of the Korumelli plates of Rajaraja I. The lingual d is distinguished from the dental d by a slight but marked prolongation upwards of the end of the character, The record presents final forms of k in line 17, of t in lines 8, 29, 31, 32, 42, 60, and 73, of n in lines 11 and 31, and of m in lines 10, 12, 13, 14 (twice), 15, 35, and 71. In line 15 it presents a peculiar mark of punctuation, regarding which reference may be made to the foot-note to that passage. As regarde palæography, the guttural does not occur. The kh, j, b, and l. all present the later cursive forms, throughout. The initial short i occurs three times ; once in line 43, and twice in line 66. In each instance, it is of the old square type, but the actual form of it presents the following abnormal feature. The full form of the old square initial short i of the alphabet with which we are concorned, consisted of an upper component which may be likened to the outstretched wings of a hovering bird, and of a separate bottom part which consisted sometimes of two circles, as may be seen very clearly in iti, the last word of the Haidarâbâd plates of Pulakośin II. of A.D.612;* and sometimes of two points or dots, as may be seen in ira, line 15, No. 15, and in jvs, line 40, the last alishara bat four, of the Diggubarru grant of Chålukya-Bhima II. of the period A.D. 934 to 945.3 The peculiarity in the present record is, that the ends of the upper component have been brought right down to the lower line of the writing, and the bottom components have been omitted. The form of the letter thus presented is not a transitional form, but is a Variety of the old square type. It Inay be characterised as more or less of a freak. But it cannot be stamped as a mistake. I have found one similar instance, in the word iti in line 23 of the Kolavennu plates of the period A.D. 934 to 945;* and there it might perhaps be treated as a mistake, because the two bottom components are duly shewn in that record, as points, in indur, line 19, and itham, line 22. In the present record, however, there is no such contrast: the abnormal form only is presented ; and it was plainly intended. In lines 73, 74, there is a Telagt, passage, for the translation of which I am indebted to Dr. Hultzsch ; and lines 65, 66 prosent somo Telugıı words, including the genitive Idiyűri. Bat, with those exceptions, the language is Sauskrit throughout. There are two of the customary benedictive and imprecatory porses in

lines 68 to 70. and seventeen ordinary verses in the body of the recoril, with one more, in line 72 f.. which refers to the djñapti, the writer, and the composer of the record. In respect of orthography, we need note only (1) the incorrect saindli, made by the rise of Ril epenthetic nie in brahmanvan=Attili, for brahmanya Attili, or more correctly trahmanyô=Ttili, in line 49; (2) the omission to combine the ť and ś in samlhi in sat-surarane, line 39, and srimat śrî, line 59-60; (3) the omission of the visarga in chårn-fri, for chårz-śrih, line 55-56, in accordance with an optional rule of Southern India, — taught, Professor Kielhorn tells me, in the Tiyasasiksha which permits the omission of a visarga before a sibilant that is followed by any consonant, kard or soft :2 (4) the doubling of s before y, once, in tassya, line 65; and (5) the use of $ for s three times, in sau, lines 17, 41, and vitrůša, line 18. 
The inscription is a record of the Eastern Chalukya king Amma II., otherwise called Vijayaditya VI. It is not dated. But we know, from other sources, that he was anointed to the sovereignty on Friday, 5th December, A..D. 945, and reigned for twenty-five years. It registers the grant of a village named Kaluchumbarru, in the Attilinându province (vishayo), to a Jain teacher named Arhanandin, belonging to the Valahâri gana and the Addakali gachchha, for the purpose of providing for repairs to the charitable diuing-hall of a Jain temple called Sarvalókåśraya-Jinabhavana. The grant was evidently made by Amma II. himself; but it was " caused to be given" by a certain lady named Chamekâmbå, who belonged to the Pattavardbika lineage and was a pupil of Arhanandin: on this point, see page 182 below The Telugu passage at the end of the record mentions a present made by Arhanandin himself to the writer of the record. 
To the identification of the places referred to in this record, we are led by the mention of the Attilinandu vishaya in line 49. This province evidently took its appellation from a town named Attili, which still exists in the Taņuku tâluka of the Godavari district, Madras Presidency; in he Indian Atlas sheet No. 94 (1899), it is shewn as ' Uttellee,' in lat. 16° 41', long. 81° 39', seven miles south-west-half-west from Tanuku. The name of the village that was granted, is presented as Kaluchumbarru in line 61, and in line 73 as Pedda-Kaluchuvubarru; this latter appellation marks it as being then the larger or older of two villages bearing the same name. It is the Kuasamurroo' of the map, the village-site of which is about three miles south-by-west from Attili ; the modern form of the name is to be explained by the not infrequent interchange of 7 and 12, and by a transition of ch into 8. Of the other places, mentioned in specifying the boundaries of Kalachumbarru, Aruvilli, on the east, is the “Arraveelee? of the map, the village-site of which is one mile towards the south-east from that of 'Kunsamurroo;' and Korukolanu, on the south, is Corecolloo,' one mile and a half south-west from 'KansamarToo; and the Viđiyûru of line 64, on the west, mentioned again as Idiyûru in line 66, is * Eedooroo, one mile and a half west-north-west from 'Kansainurroo. The other names cannot be identified, 
1 With this instance, compare the similar use of m in Súryyasutam=iva and Trikodaram-da, in VOL. III. above, p. 4, lines 4,5 ;and that passage presents also an epenthetic v, in niraradya-vudara, for niravady-oddra. We have a somewhat similar use of min Kalpalui dru)mam=jv= and Janarddanansios in Ind. Ant. Vol. XVIII. P. 287. lines 7, 8; line 7 of that record, however, presents also savitáram=iv=8 dayavantam for savit=&y=0 dayaudy, which indicates the use, in the other two instances, of the accusative for the nominative, rather than of an epenthetic m. Originally, not knowing of the existence of the modern Attili, I thought that the present reading ought to be corrected into brahmany[6*7 Mattili. And that was how I came to present the name of the district as Mattili nându, in Ind. Ant. Vol. XX. p. 271. 
In his South-Ind. Palæo, p. 31, Dr. Burnell said:- In 8. India the alternative allowed by the grammariang 1 of assimilating visarga to a following sibilant is almost universally accepted, and the reduplication of the sibilant He then omitted." This remark covers the case in question, but also includes more; it would justify the omission of 
pisarga before a sibilant which is not followed by a consonant.

The Attili country is mentioned again, as the Attili desa, in the Chellúr plates of A.D. ] 143, where, we can now seo, the correct reading is, - dėsé=såy-Attil-iti kshititala-vidité . . . . prádád 
Kåta-dandådhinathah, " this same Kata, the leader (of the forces, gave to learned Brühmaņs the Mangadorra agrahāra, together with the village of Ponduva, in the district known on the earth by the name of Attili." The Mandadorra agrahirn, it may be added, seems to be the "Mamdooroo ' of the Atlas sheet, about four miles Honzt hi-rast from Attili, and two miles on the east of Kunsamurroo.' 
Differing from all the records of the Western Chalukyas of Bådâmi, and from some of the sther re«ords of the series to which it itself belongs, this record presents the family-name, in line 5-6, in proge, as Chalukya, with the long å in the first syllable. It does the same, again, in prore, in line 30, in mentioning the king Châlukya-Bhima I. But in line 52 it presents the family-name as Chalukys, with the short a; this instance is in verse. 
In order to introduce a play upon words in connection with the incarnation of the god Vishna as dwarf, the composer has presented the name of the founder of the dynasty 48 Kubja-Vishpu (line 7), instead of using the full form Kubja-Vishậuvardhana. 
In connection with Vijayaditya III., it may be noted that this record, following some others, presents in line 15, in verge, in the form of Guñaga, a biruda, belonging to him, which in the Masulipatam(?) plates of Chålukya-Bhima II., of the period A.D. 934 to 945, is presented as Guņaka. And in the same verse, just after that, it describes him as ankakärasus&kshat. As gunaka means 'a caloulator, reckoner,' and arka means "a numerical figure,' I originally took the expression ankakeras=sdkshdi as meaning "a thorough arithmetician," and as explaining the biruda. And it is, in fact, difficult to avoid thinking that the composer of this record may have bad in view some kind of an explanation of the biruda as presented here. The full form of the báruda, however, was Gunakenallåta, "he who is good, excellent, or beautiful on account of his virtnes, "l as given in the Kolavennn plates which also were issued in the time of Chalakya Bhima II. And, though ankakära may have to be here invested with a secondary meaning, there is no doubt that it also stands for the word which in the southern records is usually written aikakära, with the Dravidian 7, and that the expression used by the composer is properly and primarily to be translated by * & veritable champion.'* Like all the other records, with one exception, this record states that Vijayaditya IlI. reigned for forty-four years, and does not, in rcality, add an alternative statement of forty-eight years ; see note 8 on page 189 below. The pole exception is the Pithapuram plates of Vira-Chodadeva of A.D. 1092-93, which specify forty years ;? this is to be attributed to a careless omission of the syllables tuscha or schatu.

KALOCHUMBARRU GRANT OF AMMA II. 
Differing from all the other records, this one says, in line 30 f., that Vikramdäitya 11. reigned for nine months. Of the other records, some say eleven months, and some say one year.? 
If taken as it actually stands in line 31 f., in prose, this record would represont Yuddha malla II. as Talapa-raj-ågrajajanmar, "born from an elder brother of king Tåliv8." This statement, however, is not borne out by the other records which mention the parentage vf Yuddhamalla II. There is, indeed, one record, the Diggabarru grant of the period A.D. 93109 945, which; in verso, speaks of him as Malla, and describes him as Taha-jyeshtha-sutu ;' and this expression, while ordinarily and most naturally meaning "eldest son of Taba," miicht alsges be rendered as meaning “son of an elder brother of Tâha." The other records, howevxt", aurat more explicit; and, it may be added, they all speak of him by his full name of Yuddhamalla. The Padamkalûru grant, of the period A.D. 945 to 970, describes him, in verse, as Taiapa-rijeku súnu, “ son of king Talapa." The Masulipatam plates, of the same period, describo Lima, in proge, as Tal-údtipa-sinui, * son of the lord Tála." The 'Yelivarra ' plates, also of the sine period, describe him, in prose, as Talapa-rajasya suta, son of king Tålapa." And the Korri melli plates, of the period A.D. 1022 to 1063, the Chellûr plates of A.D. 1090-91, alul the Pithapuram plates two years later in date, describe him, in prose, as tat-Tadapa-ruja. suta,& " son of that same king Tadapa." And, in view of those statements, we may safely decide that there is a mistake of some kind in the present record; the explanation porhaps in thut the composer used the word agrajanman, 'first-bom,' in the sense, whether correctly or not, of eldest son, instead of in its usual meaning of elder brother, and that eithor hu, or the writer of the record, carelessly repeated the ja and so produced the reading which is actually presented but is certainly wrong. 
In connection with Châlukya-Bhima II. (A.D. 934 to 945), whom it calla in line 33-34 siruply Bhima, and in line 41 Raja-Bhima, this record mentions, in line 35 ff., the following onemice overthrown by him, namely, Râjamayya, Dhalaga, Tatabikki, Bijja, Ayyapa, Govinda, a ruler of the Chðlas named Lövabikki, and Yuddhamalla. Yuddhamalla is undonbtedly thc Lustela Chalukya king Yuddhamalla II., the immediate predecessor of Chålukya-Bhima II. ; * specitiv mention of his overthrow and expulsion by Bhima II. is made in the Padarnkaltra piant 1 the period A.D. 945 to 970,7 Govinda is the Rashtrakûta king Govinda IV., for whom we bave dates ranging from A.D.918 to 933-34. Ayyapa is very possibly the Ayyapadeve, doubta less a Nolamba prince of the Nolambavâợi territory in Mysore, to whom the Western Gauga priuri, Ereyappa lent a force for the purpose of fighting against a certain Viramahdudra ; and, if so, it probably follows that Viramahəndra was another biruda of Chalukya-Bhima II., or, rather, Ver* variant of his biruda Gandamahendra. Bijja seems to be identical with the Dantiverman, alma named Bijja, who is mentioned in the spurious Sûdi plates, apparently in connection with Banaytri, as one of the foes against whom, it says, the Western Ganga prince Bataga II. (A D. 9 ore 953) fought and prevailed. And Rajamayya is perhaps the Rajavarman who, also. is muuti savit in that record, but without any indication as to where his territory lay. Lôvabikki, the rule of the Cholas, is not as yet known from any other sources. To Dhalaga and liter.kli reference is made in the Kolavennu plates of Chilukya-Bhima II. himself, iu a Verne w bigot,

presenting their names in the somewhat different forms of Dhaladi and Tatabikyana, appears to say :--- "He, this Råjamårtanda (a very sua among kings), piercing (everything) in front (of him), having conquered in battle, with his arm, him who was named Tatabikyana, (and also) Dhaladi, causes his fame to be sung by people.''! We hape, however, no information as yet as to the part of the country to which they belonged. 
It may be remarked, incidentally, that a biruda of Chålukya-Bhima Il., not mentioned in this record, which is presented in the Guņdugolanu grant of the period A.D. 945 to 970 as, apparently, Karayilladita,? would have been given more correctly as Kareyilladata: it means "he in whom there is no spot or blemish " (karey-lad-dia); and it answers exactly to the Sanskrit appellation Akalanka. 
vnamekêmbå, who caused the grant to be made, seems to be clearly marked by line 53 as a courtesan. It would appear, therefore, that she was a favourite mistress of the king. And, for a case analogous to this one, we may quote that of the courtesan Vinâ poti, the pranavallabha or “mistress as dear as life" of the Western Chalukya king Vijayaditya, who is mentioned in one of the Mahakûța inscriptions as making certain grants to a temple, and whom that record has treated with such respect as to name also her mother and grandmother & So, also, the spurious Süți plates claim a grant of some land at that village by the Western Ganga prince Bütuga II. for the purposes of a Jain temple founded by his mistress Divalâmbâ.4 
The Pattavardhika lineage (anvaya),- to which, as is indicated in line 52 f. of this record, Chámekämba belonged by birth, and in respect of which we are told that the members of it belonged to the retinue of the Chalukya kings, is mentioned as the Pattavardhini race (vansa) in a record of Amma I. (A.D. 918 to 925). That record specifies, as members of it, Kalakampa, who had been a follower of Kubja-Vishnuvardhana I., and, with his permission, had killed in battle (a king) Daddara and seized his insignia; a descendant of Kalakampa, named Sômâditya ; Somaditya's son Pritivigarâja; and Pritiviyaraja's son Bhandanå ditya, also called Kuntåditya, who had been a servant of Vijayaditya IV. (A.D. 918), and to whom the grant of a Village, registered in the record, was made. And another reference to it is to be found in a record of Amma II. (A.D. 945 to 970), which registers the grant of some fields to the Yuvardja Ballaladêva-Vêläbhata, also called Boddiya, son of (the lady) Pammavê (of) the Pattavardhini (family),

The expression svakiya privd. in Jize 70 of the text, should be rendered by “his mistress ;'s not by this wife," as was done by me in editing the record. This should perhaps have been recognised by me at the time, from the description of Dirajâmbâ in line ma Le "the one Rambliâ of the world ;" and also because, the passage being in prose, the word patnt or n hårva micht have been used just as readily as priya, if a wife was really intended. But there nre, I think, a few cases in him quite respectable women were likened to Rambhå in respect of their beauty and general cbarms; and the name to Gecara as the naine oi Ramblia, the edohri or "virtuous wife" of the poet Ratuasimla, in the Ratnapur inscription of Prithyidêva (Ep.

In addition to conveying the village itself, the record recites, in line 70 f., the grant in porpetuity, to a certain Kusumayudha, son of Kattalåmbå, of the grimakaļatra or office of Gråmaküta or headman of the village. The post was evidently that of the village oticial who is known in Marathi as the Påţêl or Pâţil, and in Kaparege as the Gavada or Gauda. 
Of the Kanarese word gavuda or gauda, wo have various earlier forms, - grunda, garında, gurronda, gavundu, gavundu, gámunda, and gúmurdu.? And we can now see that it was derived from the word gråmakūta itself, through a corruption of greim into some sach form as the gámon which occurs as the termination of certain village-names in the Paithan plates of A.D. 1272,8 coupled with, in }riţa, a disappearance of the land a softening of the finto d, and accompanied by a shifting of the nasality of the first component of the word. It may be added that, in colloquial usage, the nodera form gauda is often nasalised and pronounced gainda; also, that Professor Pischel tells me that the Désiraimunali, ii. 69, gives gümažda as the Prâkrit form of grılmahit. 
It may be remarked here that the Marathi word påțel, pâtil, oan now be distinctly traced back to the earlier word pattakila, which we have in, for instance, the Ujjain plates of A.D. 975 and 10230 and the Bhỏpal plates of A.D. 1200,10 through an intermediate form patçala wision I have found in a Sanskrit Nagari 109cription, of about the thirteenth century A.D., at Mañchar in the Poona district, in which a certain person is described, in verse, as patţéla-varya, “best or chief of the paftolas." In this case, again, there has been an eligion of a medial k. 
In line 72, the record presents the expression &jiaptih katakâdhisaḥ. The word djöapti means literally a command. But, as has been indicated before now, in such passages as the present one it was employed to denote the Dutaka or messenger, whose duty it was to communi. cate the fact and details of a grant to the local authorities, it What was intended by the word katakâdhisa, has not been so obvious. But it can now be made clear by a comparison of passages.

(14) A record of A.D. 1090-91 recites.com . . . . dattasy-âsya sådanas y=&jāaptin panncha pradhânåb, ** the ajñapti of this charter, given in the twenty-first year of the glorious and victorious reign, is the five ministers."- And similarly (15) A record of the same reign, two years later in date, recites .. dattasy=isya säsanasy=&jõaptih pamoha pradhanah, _" the ajñapti of this charter, given in the twenty-third year of the glorious and victorious reign, is the five ministers." 
Now, in the instances Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the word ajñapti unmistakably introdaces certain individual persons mentioned by name; and probably also in No. 3, where, however, a continuation of the text may have been lost. And, raja being a frequent enongh ending of proper names, it was, therefore, not unnatural that the word katakarája should have been originally taken as, similarly, a personal appellation. 
On the other hand, in the instances Nos. 14 and 15, no individual is mentioned by name, and the word ajõapti introduces a body of officials known as the five ministers. 
The word katakéśa, in No. 13, is a mere variant of the kataküdhisa of No. 12 ; and both these words are fairly capable of being taken as only synonyms of katakarája. We can recognise a decided objection to interpreting katakarāja as a proper name, in the fact that it could at least not denote one and the same individual through so long a period as that which is covered by the instances Nos. 8, 9, 10, and 11. And, from a comparison of all the passages, we may finally docide that, as has been suggested as possible some time ago, the word katakaraja, and, with it, katakådhisa and katakêśa, should be taken as denoting an official post, that of the governor or superintendent (adhisa, isa, rajan) of the royal camp (kataka). 
In earlier records, the word ajñapti occurs in the Prakrit forms, used in the same way, of 
be anatti in the Gunapadeya' plates of Vijaya-Buddhayarman, and of anati in Mayidavola plates of Siva-Skandavarman."

$ In the syllable ndýn, the & was formed by a direct continuation, upwards, of the last stroke of the *, instead of being attached, in the usual way, as a projection to the right of that stroke. This form of the d occurs again in the tyd of Satyasraya, line 6. It is met with in other places also. But it is not, on the whole, common. And the explanation probably in that, in all such cases, the vowel wag at first omitted by the writer and then was inserted on The revision of his work, and that it was formed in this exceptional manner because there was no space in which to make it in the usual way.

No. 26. FOUR INSCRIPTIONS AT SOLAPURAM. 
Be E. Holtzsch, Ph.D. Mr. G. Venkoda Rao, one of my assistants, lately visited Solapuram, a village about 8 miles south of Vellore, and copied a number of inscriptions, of which I am now pablishing the four most interesting ones. 
The ancient name of Solapuram was Kättuttumbûr (B. and D. below), which was included in Pangala-nadu, a subdivision of the district of Paduvûr-kõttam (B. below). In inscrip tions of the Chola kings Rajaraja I. (No. 421 of 1902) and Kulottróga I. (Nos. 422 and 425 
f 1902), the village is called Uyyakkondân-Solapuram and is stated to have belonged to Mugai-padu, a subdivision in the north of Pengala-nadu, a district of Jayangonda-Sola mandalam. From other inscriptions we know that Paigala-nadu included Vêlûrppidi, a suburb of Vellore, and that Tirumalai near Pôlûr belonged to Mugai-nádu. 
Vol. I. of South-Indian Inscriptions contains one inscription from Solapuram (No. 53), which I now republish (B. below) because my former transcript of it was not quite correct. A fresh copy (No. 422 of 1902) of another Solapuram inscription which was noticed in South Indian Inscriptions, Vol. I. (No. 96), enables me to add that this record opens with the words Pugal-mádu vilanya and hence belongs to Kulôttunga 1.7 and that it mentions the temple of RÂjaräjêśvara at Uyyakkopdän-Solapuram, which, as well as Rajendra-Choleśvara,' is perhaps & later designation of the Nandikampiśvara temple. 
A.INSCRIPTION OF VIJAYA-KAMPA, This inscription (No. 429 of 1902) is engraved on a long stone broken in three pieces, which were dag up by Mr. G. Venkoba Rao in a tope of trees opposite the ruined Isvara temple at Sô]aparam. 
The inscription consists of 2 mutilated Sanskrit verses in the Grantha character, and a Fassage in Tamil prose which is incomplete st the end. The Tamil portion is dated in the 8th year of king Vijaya-Kampa. The archaic alphabet of the inscription makes it probable that this king is identical with Kampavarman, whose inscriptions at Ukkal are dated in the 10th and 15th years.10 As I shall show further on (p. 196 below), he was perhaps a son of the Ganga-Pallava king Vijaya-Nandivikramayaman and hence belonged to the ninth century of the Christian era. 
The Tamil portion records that a chief naned Râjâditya built a temple of Siva and a tomb ir memory of his deceased father Přithivigangaraiyar and apparently made a grant to & Brahmaņa. The mutilated Sanskřit portion contained a genealogical account of this Rajaditya. His earliest ancestor was Madhava of the Gângêya family, whose son was "he who was renowned as the splitter of even a stone-pillar." In the inscriptions of the Western Gangas, this

feat is ascribed to the mythical king Konganivarman, who is, however, there represented as the father and not as the son of Madhava The Solapuram inscription then states that in his (vir. Kooganivarman's) family was born at king whose name is given in the corrupt form of Atvivarman, which may be meant for Atrivarman, Agnivamman, Arivarman, eto. Verse 2 praises & king whose name is lost; but the Tamil portion suggests that this is the person who is there called Prithivigangaraiyar. Verse 3, of which only the first and last words are preserved, opens with the name of Raja ditya, who is described in the Tamil portion as the son of Prithivigangaraiyar and the contemporary of Vijaya-Kampa. As regards Prithivigargaraiyar, he must be different from the Ganga chief Přithivipati I., because the latter was the father of Marasingha and the son of Sivamâra, while the former was the father of Rajậditya and apparently the son of the king whose name is hidden in the corrupt form Atvifarman.

TRANSLATION. Hail! Prosperity! (In) the twenty-third year of king Vijaya-Kampavikramavarman the sacred temple was caused to be built to the god Narayana (at) Kåttuttumbûr in Pangaļa-pâdu, (a subdivision) of Paduvûr-kôttam; (it) was endowed with the name Kanakavalli-Vishnu. griha; and, for the worship at the three times of the day), for offerings at the three times (of the day), (for) a perpetual lamp, and as a living for the worshipper, (there was granted] to it laud below the tank of Kanakavalli in the same lottam (and) in the same nádu. 
O.INSCRIPTION OF SAKA-SAMVAT 871. This Tami] inscription (No. 428 of 1902) is engraved on a rock Dear pond called Kallanguttai, south-west of Sôlapuram. 
The date of this inscription is expressed in three different waya, vit. (a) “the year two;"> (b) the Saka year 871 (in words); and (c) "the year in which the emperor Kapnaradova Vallabha, having pierced Råjåditya, entered the Tondai-mandalam.” The second and third portions of the date furnish an interesting confirmation of the Atakar inscription, according to which the Rashtrakūta king Krishna III. had killed the Chôļa king Råjåditya at Takkolam in Saka-Samvat 872 current, the Saumya-samvatsara = A.D. 949-50. As the date of the Solapuram inscription does not contain a cyclic year, it is impossible to say if its Saka year has to be taken as expired or current. In the former case the date would be the same as that of the Â takûr insaription, and in the second case it would be A.D. 948-49. The * yaar two" with which the Solapuram inscription opens cannot refer to the reign of Krishna III., because wa know from the Deðli plates that Ambghavarsha, the father of Krishna III., had died and that the latter was reigning in A.D. 940. Hence, as far as I can see, the "year two" can only refer to the reign of the Chola king Räjaditya. This' would indirectly confirm Professor Kielhorn's calculation of the date of an inscription at Karam, according to which the 40th year of Parantaka I., the father and immediate predecessor of Råjå ditya, corresponded to A.D. 946.6 It may now be provisionally assumed that Parântaka I. reigned from about A.D. 907 to at least 946, and that Råjåditya Was crowned in about A.D. 948 and was killed by Krishna III. in about A.D. 949. 
The purpose for which the subjoined ingcription was engraved was to record the construo tion of the pond near which it is found, and which was called the Kallinangai pond

in memory of # Woman ilamed Kalļinaigai. The present name Kalladguttai, k.e. the robber& pond,' is evidently a popular corruption of the original one. Kallina ögai had died at Arungagram, & village in the modern Ardot taluka. She was the daughter of the Ganga chief Attimallar (ie. Hastimalla) alias Kannaradêva-Přith vigangaraiyar. This chief was the son of Vayiri-Adiyap, the lord of Pangala-nađu. Hence he seems to be different from the Gaåga-Båga chief Hastimalla alias Prithivipati II., who was the son of Marasimha. The word Kahnaradêya, which is prefixed to the name of Prithvigangaraiyar, characterises the latter as a subordinate of the conqueror Krishna III. His wife Kamakkaņår bore the title Gangamabadêyi and was the daughter of Våņakovaraiyar Orriyür-Adiyan. Vånakðvaraiyar is known to have been the title of certain chiefs. Orriyar-Adiyan means "the devotee of the temple at Tiruvorriyûr.'8

Nandikampisvara must have been the ancient name of the tomple of Isvara (Biva) ca Thich this inscription is engraved As no other Siva temple exists at Solapuram, it may be also identified with the Isvara temple that was founded during the reigu of Vijaya-Kampa according to the inscription A., and the Nandi-Kampa, after whom the Nandikampisvara temple was called, may be identical with Vijaya-Kampa. As the alphabet of the inscriptions of Vijaya Kanpa, Kampavarman or Vijaya-Kampavikramavarman resembles that of the inscriptions of Vijaya-Dantivikramavarman, Vijaya-Nandivikramavarman and Vijayı-Nfipatuúgavikram** varman, I feel tempted to explain Nandi-Kampa by Kampa, the son of Nandi,' and to assume that Kampayarnan was a son of Nandivikaamavarman and a brother of Nripatuðgavikrum yainan. The temple of Guñamalai may have been a shrine in the Nandikampisvara temple or another name of the Vishnu temple referred to in B. above.

No. 27-A VAISHNAVA INSCRIPTION AT PAGAN. 
By E. Hultzsch, Ph.D. This inscription was noticed at Pagàn by the Honourable Mr. A. T. Arundel, C.8.1., in the course of his tour through Burma. At his instance, Mr. Taw Sein Ko furnished me with an ink impression of it in December 1902. After I had sent him a copy of the subjoined text and translation, he was good enough to supply me in February 1903 with three further ink-impres sion, and with the following additional information :-The inscription" is engraved on sandstone and was found at Myinpagån, which is situated about a mile to the south of Pagin. At Myinpagan lived Manôhart, the last of the Talaing kings, who was led into captivity by Anawrata, king of Pagan, in 1057 A.D. The captive king was surrounded by his fellow countrymen, who must have extended their friendship to colonists from Southern India. A Vaishnava temple has been found at Pagån, but none at Myinpagàn. The inscription may belong to that temple, or to some other building which has since been demolished." 
The inscription consists of one verse in the Sanskrit language and Grantha alphabet, and a prose passage in the Tamil language and alphabet. The Tamil characters are those of the thirteenth century of the Christian ela. 
The Sanskřit verge is taken from the Mukundamdlag (verse 6), a short poem by the Vaishnava saint Kulasekhara, who, as shown by Mr. Venkayya, must have lived before the eleventh century.* 
The Tamil probe passage records gifts by & native of Magödayarpattanam in Malaimandalam, 1.0. Cranganores in Malabar. His name, Sri-Kulagékhara-Nambi, stamps him as a devotee of the Vaishnava saint Kulakékhara, from whose Mukundamdid the opening Yerde is derived. The recipient of the gifts was the Vishnu temple of Nâpådési. Viņpagar at Pukkem alias Arivattapapuram, t.e. at Pagån, which in the Kalyani inscriptions is styled 
Arimaddanapura alias Pugama. Nánadesi-Viņpagar means the Vishnu temple of those coming from various countries.' This name shows that the temple, which was situated in the heart of the Buddhist country of Burma, had been founded and was resorted to by Vaishqavas from various parts of the Indian Peninsula. 
1 See above, p. 145 and note 1. 
The word ddva refers to Nandikampisvara-deva. Evidently the authorities of this temple had to make over one olakk# of flowers per day to the temple of Ganamilai-peru mân.

It wat originally brought to my notice by Mr. Govind Gangadhar Deshpande. And I obtained ink impressions of it in 1882. It is now edited for the first time. The collotype is from ar ink-impression received in 1886 from Mr. Condong, Superintendent of the Archeological Survey of the Bombay Presidenoy. 
Mantravaat is a village about five miles towards the east-by-north from niggaon, ex head-quarters of the Bankšpui talaka of the Dharwat district. The ladian Atlas sheni No. 42 (1827). shows it as 'Munturrehdee.' The Mop of the Dharwari Oollectorater (1874) shows it as 'Mantruwadee. The present record seems to indicate that its original name wa Elpuņuse, or else Elamvalli. And the purport of it places both Blpuţüse and Blättråļļi in the Purigere district, the Farigore three-hundred of other coorde. The ingóryption is on a

about 2'01" und sach of them is of the tranks of 
charact but the greates ra- Re(?)vayyana, a to 
stone tablet, which was found near a temple of Hanimat at Mantra wadi and is now stored in the kachori at Shiggaon. 
At the top of the stone, there are sculptures representing the goddess Lakshmi, squatting and facing full-front, with an elephant on each side, standing towards her; the tips of the trunks of the elephants, which are uplifted, meet above her head; and each of them holda, apparently, a Lower over her. The writing covers an area about 2' 05" broad by 391 high, and is mostly in a state of very good preservation, Ia addition to the record edited and shewn in the collotype, there is one line of writing below the sculptures, which are, as usual, on a surface which projects homewhat in front of that part of the stone which bears the body of the record. It is in characters of the same type with those of the body of the record; and it gave the name of the writer : but the greater part of it is damaged and illegible; we can only recognise, at the beginning of the line Sri-Ré(?)vayyana, and at the end likhitam, with perhaps a cross-mark below the m, as if to slew that something is to be supplied here, namely, possibly, the aksharak, standing before the Svasti of line 1 of the body of the record, which are not wanted there and seem to be meaningless. The characters are Kanarese, boldly formed and well executed. The size of them ranges from about " in the dha of dharmmadol, line 22, to about 11" in the va of goravarun, line 8; the lohi of pelohisal, line 15, and the fta of koštar, line 17, are each abont 24" high. The lingual q is not very clearly, if at all, distinguished from the dental d. As regards the palmography, the ' does not occur. The j occurs four times, in lines 2, 3, and 8, and is, in bach Cahe, of the old square type: the exact form aimed at in this record, is illnstrated best in the jd of rdjidhi, line 2, No. 2; it is a closed form, of that particular shape from which there may have been derived, quite directly, the back-to-back,j and the open j which we have in the Doddahupdi inscription of Nitimirga and Satyavákya. The lh occurs three times, in lines 6, 17, and 20, and again in likhitam in the line below the soulptures : in each case, it is of the later cursive type ; and the form of it is practically identical with the modern form of the present day : it is seen best in the kha of akhandita, at the end of line 17. The boccars mors often, and is of the later cursive type, throughout; the intended form of it is soen very clearly in the bå of badhi, line 16, No. ll, and is to be recognised as almost identical with the modern form of the present day. The locours still more freely, and is, also, of the later cursive type, through out, including the lin likhitam in the line below the sculptures ; the particular form of it aimed at in this record, is perhaps exbibited most clearly in the la of kålart, line 17, No. 2. Except in the 7 of rakshisal, line 15, where it is hardly to be detected, in the l, as presented in this record, we can recognise a feature which played an important part in the process by which the later prizsive type of this character was evolved from the old square type, namely, the miniature representa hion, of the principal part of the old square character, which stands here in the centre of the Later cursive obaracter. In the development of the later character, the first step was the pro longation, with a sweep to the right, of the downstroke with wbich the formation of the original Character ended., feature which is well illustrated in the Hatti-Mattür insoription of the time of Krishna I. ;* that was eventually followed by a continuation of that stroke up to the top line of the writing; and, meanwhile, the principal part of the original character was diminished, rounded off, and raised, until the original leading characteristic of the old square letter w48 almost 
for entirely lost. In some Kanarese fonts of the present day, it has disappeared altogether, instance, in the font used, in accordance with the general custom, in the Rev. Dr. F. Kittel's Kaur nadar Hnglish Dictionary ; on the other hand, the ninjature of the principal part of the old square character is distinctly recognisable in the font used for the words presented in Kanarese charac

Gôvinda III. of 4.D, 804 ; 1 it is here geen best in the må of nelanum=Aditya, line 14, No. 7: it occurs again in likhitam, in the line below the sculptures, where it is formed somewhat smaller than usual, so as to mark it as a final form; it is a character which may often be confused with one form of re, rê. The corresponding form of the v occurs, but not very clearly, in the upper v of sarvva, line 16, No. 10. The language is Kanarese, of the archaic type, in probe. In sásanamum, lide 9-10, the copulative ending uń is attached to the usual archaic ending of the nominative singular neuter in n, m; on the otber hand, in line 8 it is doubtful whether the m has been retained,~ mahajanamui, or whether it has been softened into y, mahajanavun. In line 20 we seem to have the accusative singular neuter in v,-- dharmavam; while, on the other hand, in line 17 we have clearly the more archaic form in my sthúnaman. In line 14, in sthanamuvan or sthånavuvan, the , m, of the copulative suffix, with the accusative ending after it, zeems distinctly to have been softened into v; but, whether the m of sthanar, athúnam, has been retained before it, or has been softened into y, is doubtful. Line 10 gives us (unless we assume a mistake of s for s) - dise, as another variant of dise, dese, '& quarter or point of the compass, direction, region, side ;' line 12 gives niru-gal, which seems clearly to mean '& set up stone,' nörut being, no doubt, connected with mire, 1, 'to be properly arranged or prepared, to be ready, from which we have nitisu, 'to put down, place, arrange, adjust, prepare,' which occurs in line 20 in respect of the setting up of the stone itself that bears the record ;% line 15 gives pelchisu, as a variant of perchisu, pechchisu, 'to cause to increase, to multiply'; and line 21-22 gives brahmati, as a variant of brahmati, brahmeti, = brahmahatya, 'the killing of a Brâhman.' meme The orthography does not present anything calling for comment. 
The inscription refers itself to the reign of the Rashtrakūta king Amôghavarsha Iogramm son and successor of Gôvinda III., who was on the throne from A.D. 814 or 815 to A.D. 877 or 878. And it mentions a feudatory of his, named Kuppêya,+ who was governing the Purigera district. The object of it was to record the grant of some lands to a priest named Gökarna paņạitabhatára. The sculptures at the top of the stone mark the record as & Vaishgaya record, and thus shew that the doneo was a Vaishňava. And it seems worth noting that one of the donors was a Gorava or Saiva priest. 
The record is dated on the full-moon day of Vaisakha of the Parthiva sansvatsara, coupled With Saka-Samvat 787. Whatever systein of the cycle is applied, the Saka year is the expired year,

Compare pel-dore," the great river, for the upore usual per-dore in the Mulgund inscription of A.D. 976 ; Vol. VI. above, p. 269, text line 5. 
The vowel of the penultimate ayllable is apparently to be taken as the long é, on the analogy of the & in Bankera, which is marked as long by the metro in line 53 of the inscription at Konnür (Vol. VI, above, p. 38): but it is not quite certain that the long & is not used there simply to suit the metre. The name of Bankėya or Bankaya aypears also as Baúka, iu Burkela (Vol. VI. above, p. 30, text line 19). So, also, the name Kuppeya or Kuppeya appearg-(but in the case of another person.) -- as Kuppa, and Kuppanna, in the Nidagundi inscription, F. below, page 214.

E...Sirûr inscription of the time of Amôghavarsha I.- 4.D. 886. This inscription was brought to notice and edited by me in 1883, in the Ind. Ant. Vol. XII. p. 215 ff., from an ink-impression obtained in 1882. A lithograph of it was not given then. And, for that and other reasons, it is now re-edited. The collotype which accompanies the present revised version of the record, is from an ink-impression which Mr. Cousens was good enough to obtain for me in 1898, the original impression having suffered some damage and become unsuitable for reproduction. 
Sirûr is a village about sixteen miles west-by-north from Nawalgund, the head-quarters of the Nawalgand taluka of the Dharwår district. The Indian Atlas sheet No. 41 (1852) shews it as Serroor.' And the Map of the Dharwar Collectorate (1874) shews it as "Siroor, The record gives its name in the older form of Srivüra, which may possibly be a mistake for Srivůra, with the long t. And the purport of it places Sirûr in the Belvola three-hundred district. The inscription is on a stone tablet somewhere on the south of the nude or village-bastion at Sirür. 
I have no information as to whether there are any sculptures at the top of the stone. -- The writing covers an area about 3' 17" broad by 3' 3" high. The extant portion of it is in a fairly good state of preservation, and can be read without any uncertainty, throughout. But, before it canie to notice at all, a portion of it had been broken away and lost at the upper left-hand corner, it consequence of which there is missing & part of the text ranging from fifteen or sixteen aksharas in line 1, to one akshara in line 7. And, since the time when the original impression was obtained by me, some damage has been done to the lower left-hand corner, whereby we have lost ono complete akshard at the beginning of lines 22, 23, and 24. The characters are Kanarese, boldly formed and well executed. They contrast rather curiously with those of the Nilgund inscription, edited in Vol. VI. above, p. 98 f., which are of a much more squave and upright

stylo suggestive, at first sights of their belonging to a period considerably earlier than the time of the present inscription, though the two records are, in reality, of precisely the same date; this difference is to be attributed, of course, to the facts, that the two records were written by different persons, and that the Bhatta who wrote the Nilgund record for the engraver to transfer it to the stone, or who painted it on the stone for the engraver to reproduce it there, was a better writer or draughtsman than Madhavayya who wrote or painted the present record, and also was more guided, in some details, by a prepossession in favour of the older types and style.

The record presenta final forms, of 1 in rájyan-bol, line 14, and of l in Búranåsivadov, line 21; there ought to have been a final t, of abhût, in line 3, but it was omitted. The distinct form of the linguald is, curiously enough, presented in pudidudu, line 24, where, however, it is a mistake for the dental d; whereas it is not shewn in the du of eradum at the end of line 16 : & remark, which might have been made earlier, may be made here, namely that it was seldom, if ever, the early practice to rise the distinct form of the d in the combination nd; we must suppose that the r was considered sufficient to mark the nature of the subscript consonant. As regards palæography, this record presents all the five principal test-letters. The kh occurs twice, in sankha, line 9, and in likhitam, for likhitam, line 23; and, in both places, it is distinctly of the old square type, though there are no actually straight lines in it; it is exhibited best in the khí of liknitañ, line 23, No. 18. The j occurs freely, and is of the old square type thronghout; we have an open form of it in the jô of thvajoru, line 9, No. 29, and again in the ja of pankaja, line 18: in some other cases, illustrated very well by the ja of mahajanada, line 20, No. 19, there is a clear space between the centre stroke and the upright part of the letter ; but, in other cases, that stroke is joined to the upright stroke, according to the original practice, and we have the fully closed form of the character, as is illustrated very well by the upper i of the rjju in Nagarjjunan, line 22, No. 22. The ri occurs ten times, and, following the j in the usual manner, is of the old square type, throughout: in some cases, it presents the open form, as in the nga of tturiga, line 11, No. 2 ; in the other cases, it presents the fully closed form, which is illustrated very well in the nga of Nripatungą, line 13, the last akshard. The b occurs eleven times : in nine cases, it is of the old square type, sometimes in the closed form illustrated in the be of Beluola, line 18, No. 26, and sometimes in the open form exhibited in the bi of biffon, for bátfon, line 20, the last alushara but one : but in the bda of sabda, line 7, No. 4, we can recognise clearly, though the akshara is somewhat damaged, the later cursive form, the occurrence of which here is made doubly peculiar by the fact that the old square type was presented in the same word, of the same passage, in line 9 of the Nilgund record; evidently the writer of this official record, familiar with both types but more accustomed to the later type for ordinary purposes, intended to use the older type of the 
throughout, but made an involuntary slip in the word sabda and inadvertently used the later type there; and it would seem that he began to do the same in the subscript b in nba, the last akshara of line 4, but recognised the mistake almost directly after beginning the letter, and turned it into a b of the old square type with a very abnormal dip down in the top stroke. The I ocoura freely, and is here of the later cursive type thronghout, though the Nilgund record presents the old square 7 much more frequently than the later charaoter : the exact form aimed at, es a rule, in this record, is perhaps exhibited in the la of kalan, line 20, No. 29, as well as anywhere else : but the li of likhitam, line 23, No. 17, exhibits very markedly the preservation in 
It may be romarked that lines 4 and 7 present the first instances of the occurrence of the letter / in this record, and that may account for the peculiarity pointed out. After the first une of the old aquare ), in dadde, line 12, there is no relapao of any kind into the later cursive type. In the 3d of Adrandriyty line 28, there is a otroke in the centre, which seems to be due to a glip of the engraveria tool; through some mishap in the inal print. ing, some of the copies of the collotype show a break, which does not mally exist, in the top stroke of this atsaara.

miniature, in the centre of the later cursive letter, of the principal part of the old square character, to which attention has already been drawn on page 199 above, in the remarks on the Mantrapàdi inscription of A.D. 865; and the same feature is recognisable, though not so pointedly, in alankzitan, line 1, kavileyan, line 21, and kavileyu, line 22, There seem to be three abnormal vowel-marks in this record : the stroke projecting downwards from the bottom of the k of ganiká, near the end of line 8, appears to be intended to supply the d, which was omitted in its proper place on the top line of the writing; in the superscript i of srimad, near the beginning of line 16, the long vowel appears to be marked by a curve on the right, instead of the left in the usual mander; and in srimad, line 18, it appears that, i having been written instead of , au apward stroke to the right was added, on revision, by way of marking the powel as long.- As regards the language, we have ordinary Sanskrit verses in lines 1 to 6; and the remainder of the record is in Kanarese, of the archaic style, in prose. As far as the words Annigereyal-ire, in line 19, this record follows the same draft on which there was based the corresponding part of the Nilgund inscription. But this record does not seem to have included the verse Jayati bhuvanih kiírañain, etc., which we have in the beginning of the Nilgund inscription, and it presents a few various readings, of which, however, only Sauján, instead of Gaud ûn, in line 4, is of any particnlar interest. Like the Nilgund inscription, this record presents, in line 8, the word prátirájya, employed in the sense of prataraja,' a hostile king,' or rather, perhaps, 'a collection of hostile kings.' In Báranäsivadoy, line 21, we have a curious substitute for the usual locative Bårarásiyol, with which we have to compare the locative Varanasivadul in an inscription at Balagâmi," and Baramasivada, in the place of the usual genitive Bárañasiya, in an inscription at Pattadakal; these forms suggest, of course, the existence and occasional use of a base Bärandsiva (with such variants as Biranasiva and Varanasiva), for which, however, it is difficult to account. In respect of orthography, the only points to be noted are (1) the use of ri for ri in the word srishti, line 10, just as in lines 12 and 33 of the Nilgund record, and again in vriddhi, line 15; and (2) the occurrence of lúñchanan, instead of lañchhanan, in line 13, just as in line 16 of the Nugund record. 
This inscription is another record of the reign of the Rashtrakūta king Amôghavarsha I. and it is distinctly dated in such a way as to shew that he commenced to reign in A.D. 814 or 815. It mentions, like the Nigand inscription, an officer of his, named Dêvannayya, who, residing at Annigere, was governing the Belvola three-hundred district. And, devoted to the same end with the Nilgund inscription, it records that Dêvannayya assigned the tax on clarified butter to the two-bandred Mahajanas, of Srivůra doubtless in order to make the proceeds of the tax available for expenditure by them on communal purposes, instead of being credited to the state revenues. 
The record is dated at the time of an eclipse of the sun on Sunday the new-moon day of the (amanta) month Jyaishtha of the Vyaya samvatsara, Saka-Samvat 788 (expired), in the fifty second year of the reign of Amôghavarsha I. And the corresponding English date is Sunday, 18th June, A.D. 886, when there was a total eclipse of the sun, visible in India, at 9 hrs. 4 min. after mean sunrise. 
The date presented in this record fixes, as I have pointed out before now, the commence ment of the reign of Amôghavarsha I. in A.D. 814 or 815, in the following manner. The record places the new-moon day of the amanta month Jyaishtha, oni which day the assignment

registered in it was made, in the Vyaya samvatsara, Saka-Samvat 788 (expired), and in the fifty second year of his reign. But it does not say that the fifty-second year of his reign coincided either with the samvatsara or with the Saka year. The new-moon day of the amánta Jyaishtha, Š.-S. 788 expired, being in his fifty-second year, it follows that the new-moon day of the amânta Jyaishtha, S.-S. 737 expired, fell in the first year of his reign. And the first year of his reign began on some day from Ashådha sukla 1 of the Vijaya samvatsara, S.-S. 736 expired, falling in May or June, A.D. $14, to the amanta Jyaishtha krishna 30 of the Jaya samvatsara, S.-S. 787 expired, falling in June, A.D. 815.

1 From the ink-impression.-- In the footnotes to the text of the Nilgund inscription, Vol. VI. above, p. 102 ff., auch differences of reading in the two records, as seem to present anything at all of interest, have been exhibited. It does not seem necessary to show them all here again. 
2 Metre, sidka (Anushtubb).- Before the verse, there was doubtless an Om, represented by & plain symbol, 28 at the beginning of the Nilgund inscription. There seems to be not toom enough for the word Svasti to bave stood after the Om.-- From the ink-iwpressions, it cannot be decided whether there was, or was not, any writing above the irst extant line of the predent record. But the verse Jayati Bhuvana-kdranan, ato., which we bave in the beginning of the Nilgund inacription, would fill about & line and a half in the writing of the present record ; and the fint pdda of the verse Sa värvydd, etc., preceded by Om, quite suffices to fill the lacuns in the frat part of line 1. And it seems, therefore, that the verse Jayati bhuvana-kdranan, etc., was not used here, and that no writing is missing above the first extant line; beosuse it would be contrary to custom to leave a blank space of half a line or so between two guch verses,

See Vol. VI. above, p. 103, note 7; and for oddiyya viyya-mana read either dadipyamana,' very brightly shining,' or addhüyamdna, 6 being waved to and fro like fang,' In favour of d&dipyamana, it may be noted that a Tamil song presents the expression “O king, whose wbite umbrella shines resplendeut;" geo Ind. An. Vol. XXVIII. p. 29. 
After the jb, the writer or engraver first formed & R, and then, without properly correcting them into r added the # rather imperfectly. 
* In the akthara re, the superscript & is formed very anomalously. * Read, probably, vishay.ddhindth; see Vol. VI. above, p. 103, note 11. 
Apparently bhanjanon was intended, without samdhi with the following word. As remarked in Vol. VI. above, P. 103, note 12, from this point more attention was paid, both in this record and in the Nilgund record, to the case-endings of the nominatives. 
& First ta was written ; and then it was corrected into dz. 
✓ Read vallaðhendrana or vallabhendrana. Nilgund, line 17, has the same mistake, except that the authodra was omitted. 
* In the fri, the long & seems to be marked here by a curve on the right, instead of the left as, for instance, in frt, line 13; 80, al&, in Srimad in line 1.8 below, it seems to be abnormally marked by a stroke upwards to the right. 
* The anusodra is quite clear in the impression, though not in the collotype. 10 The original had rajyajyd ; and thon the jya was cancelled. 11 Read alkiosiddhiyith ; see Vol. VI. above, p. 104, note 7. » Regarding the way in which the super&cript t is formed, nee note 8 above. 
15 Read Annigereyol, aa in Niigand, line 22; or else dirigersyal. As regards the ani, which is probably a mistake for ppi, see Vol. VI. above, p. 100, pote 3. From the collotype, it might be thought that we have here the long 1. But that is only due to a fault in the impression. My impression of 1882 shews distinctly that the powalo mark is quite closed down on to the top stroke of the consonant, and that the vowel is therefore the short .

We might, of course, supply !, and, reading Berandsiyul, obtain here #nother instance of the comparatively rare locative in ul, regarding which $0 Vol. VI. above, p. 99, and note 1 on page 100. But it seems more likely that the copulative nominative (Barandsiyum), standing for the accusative 
Baranasiyuman), was intended here, as was certainly the case in the next word but ono, Kavileyú, which is the mistake for kavileywn, standing for Kavileyuman. For the justification of the use of the accusative of Bdrandst in this and similar passages, Bee Vol. VI. above, p. 107, note 5. 
* This ra was evidently at first omitted, and was then inserted on revision. 
$ The original impression of 1882 shews, between this alshara and the be which is above it, a thin horizontal line, seren-eighths of an inch long, which seems to have been intended to turn the ! into a temette, In Mr, Cougeng" impression, also, this line is visible; but more faintly, because of a little too much ink having been used. In the collotype, it is hardly diacernible at all.

* The Nilgund inscription gives Gauda. Sauța may perhaps be accepted as another form of Sauda, the nama of a country mentioned in the Rdjatarangint, vi. 800, which speaks of & matha founded at Diddipura for the accommodation of people from the Madhyadéša or middle country, and from Lâța, Sauda, and Udra (?). Or, as In jine 13 the writer first wrote Garuto and then corrected the ta into da, Šautan may be treated as an uncorrected mistake for Sanddn. Or, again, we might assume that the i, also, is a mistake for g, which would not be at all imposible; and, on that view, the Sautan of this record would be simply a mistake for Gaudan in the original draft,

F.-Nidagundi inscription of the time of Amôghavarsha I.-About A.D. 874-75. 
This inscription has been mentioned by me in Vol. III. above, p. 163, móte 1. It is not edited for the first time. I originally obtained ink-impressions of it in 1882. The accompanying collotype, however, is from an ink-impression received from Mr. Cousens in 1886. 
Nidagundi is a village about four miles towards the south-south-west from Shiggaon, the head-quarters of the Bankâpar taluka of the Dharwår district. The Indịan Atlas sheet No. 4!

71004) shows it as - Neergoondee.' And the Map of the Dharwar Collectorate (1874) shews it 
Needgoondee. The present record gives its name in the older form of Nidugundage, and marks it as the chief town of a group of villages known as the Niềugundage twelve. And the purport of the record has the effect of plaoing it and its attached villages in the Kundarage seventy, and perhaps in also the Belgali three-hundred. The inscription is on a stone tablet, which was found in a field, Survey No. 64, at Nidagundi, and is now stored in the kachëri at Shiggaon. 
The top of the stone, about 75" high, shows the sculptures of a litiga on its abhisheka stand, with the bull Nandin, recumbent, and facing towards it. These sculptures cover about two thirds of the top part of the stone. The rest of it, on the proper right side, is occupied by six short linos of writing, in characters of the same type and period, which contain & short supple montary record; they have been numbered 20 to 25, and are given after the text of the body of the record. -- The writing of the body of the record covers an area about 1' 91" broad by 2' 41' high, and is mostly in a state of very good preservation. ---- The characters are Kanarose, boldly formed and well executed. They are fairly uniform in size, ranging mostly between about egy and 1%; but the yo of Vấran siyo?, in line 17, is only a little more than " high : the fri in line 1 is about 2" high. The record itself presents final forms, of t in srimat, line 5, and of m in koftam, line 13, and padodornm, line 16; and we have the final n again in the supplementary record at the top of the stone, in bhattâram, line 22. The anusvára is formed between the lines of writing, instead of above the top line, in idan, line 16, and apparently also in kavileyurn, line 18. The distinct form of the lingual d can be recognised clearly in panneradumán, line 9, and still more go in perggede, for perggade, line 11; it is also marked, though not so plainly, in Nidugundage, line 9, Gadiyammamn, line 15, and padedorim, line 16: and it is exhibited again in padoda[m], line 24. As regards palæography, - the kh does not occur. The occurs fonr timos: in the jya of rdjyan, line 3, No. 8, and in the ja of vijaya, line 4, No. 8, it is of the old square type, closed; but in j& twice in maharajadhirúja, line 2, Nos, 6 and 9, it is the later cursive character. The si occurs twice, in lines 16, 17: in both places, it is of the old square type, closed; it is presented most clearly in the sige of kádorge, line 16, the last akshara but one : it occurs again in the supplementary record, in anugrahan-geydu, line 23-24 ; and thero, also, it is of the old square type, closed. The b occurs nine times : in the bdha of Opalabdha, line 4, No. 6, we have the later cursive form; but, in all the other instances, we have the old square type, in the closed form, and the intended exact form of it is perhaps best illustrated by the ba of Bant kéyange, line 10, No. 4 ; it occurs again in the supplementary record, in sabbá, line 22; and there Also, it is of the old square type, but, apparently, in the open rather than the closed form: the Bolitary instance of the use of the later cursive form in opalabdha, line 4, No. 6, must, as in the Odge of the Sirûr record, be explained as & slip on the part of the writer. The l occurs more freely still : it is, throughout, of the later cursive type, as also in the supplementary record, in cholege or volege, line 23: the la of lakshmi, line 4, exhibits very markedly the preservation, in miniature, of the principal part of the old square character, to which attention has already been drawn on page 199 ; but the la of dégulaman, line 14, No. 8, probably illustrates beat the exact form that was aimed at in this record. The language is Kanarese, of the archaic type, in prose. In line 23, we have a word chole or vole, the meaning of which is not apparent.-- The orthography does not present anything calling for comment, except (1) the insertion of an un necessary anusvåra in Rapanurinm, line 10-11, Gúdiyammain, line 15, and padedo mm, for padledon or padedon, line 16; and (2) perhaps the use of v for b, in vattdra, line 14, for batfúra 48 & possible tadbhava-corruption of bhattara; hero, however, the u is possibly simply a writer's mistake for bh. 
This inscription is another record of the reign of the Råshtrakūta king Amôghavarsha I. It mentions an official of his, named Bankêya or Bankêyarasa, wbo was governing the Banayåsi twelve-thousand province, and the districts' known as the Belgali three-hundred, the

Kundarage seventy, the Kundûr five-bundred, and the Purigere three-hundred. And it mentions also a son of Banköya, named Kundatte, who was governing the group of villages known as the Niţugundage twelve. The primary object of it waş to record the grant of some lands to a temple of the god Mahadeva (Siva). The short supplementary record at the top of the stone, indicates a certain Viņakadéva as the person on whose instigation the grant was made. 
The date of this record is expressed in a very exceptional and peculiar manner. The Sala year is not mentioned. Nor is the name of the samvatsara given. And the record only refers itself to the time, --Amôghavarsha . . . . ond-uttaram råjyam-geygutt-ire, - "while Amoghavarsha was reigning increased by one." Evidently, there was here an omission of some kind or another, whether intentional or accidental. And we have to consider whether we can supply that omission. 
Now, from the Sirûr inscription, which quite clearly and unmistakably places the new-moon day of the ananta month Jyaishtha of the Vyaya samvatsara, Saka-Samvat 788 expired, in the fifty-second year of his reign, we know, as shewn on page 204 f., that Amoghavarsha I. began to reign in A.D. 814 or 815. One of the Kanheri inscriptions supplies for him the date, without full details, of S.-S. 799 (expired), = A.D.877-78. Though he had then been reigning for at least sixty-two full years, we might, if we should like, as there is nothing as yet in the dates of his successor to oppose it, add another two years to his reign. And it might thus be thought possible to take the date of the present record as equivalent to " (the Saka year 800) increased by one," that is to say, Saka-Samyat 801 (expired), = A.D. 879-80. We hate, however, not any proved instance of Indian historical dates having been expressed in that elliptical manner, with omission of the centuries, except in connection with the Laukika reckoning of Kashmir and of some adjacent parts of Northern India. That reckoniog was devised in only the tenth, or possibly the ninth, century A.D. There is not anything that can give us a reasonable cause for believing in the existence of any Indian custom of recording historical dates with "omitted hundreds," except in those parts and in connection with that particular reckoning. And I do not for a momeot think it possible that the present date is to be explained in that way. 
Some other explanation must be found. Now, we know that the reign of Amôghavarsha I. lasted for at least sixty-two full years, and that it thus included one complete revolution of the sixty-years cycle of the planet Jupiter. We know, also, that the use of that cycle, in the Kanarese country, was definitely established by the Rashtrakûțas, and that it was already being freely used there in the time of Amoghavarsha I. There is, indeed, one epigraphic instance of its use in those parts before the Rashtrakậta period ; namely, in the Mahakûța pillar inscrip tion of the Western Chalukya king Mangalêśa, which is dated in the fifth year of his reign and in the Siddhartha samvatsara, with other details which place it on exactly the 12th April, A.D. 602. That, however, is at present only an isolated epigraphic instance of earlier times. But the use of the cycle was definitely established by the Rashtrakûças. Amongst the recorda of Govinda III., the father and predecessor of Amôghavarsha I., we have it in the plates from the Kanarese country of A.D. 804, in the Waņi plates of A.D. 807, in the Rådhanpur plates of A.D. 808, and in the Tôrkhede plates of A.D. 813,3 Amongst the records of Amoghavarsha I., we have already found it used in the Kanheri inscription of A.D. 851,4 in the Mantrawåại inscription of A.D. 865,5 in the Nilgand inscription of A.D. 866,6 and in the Sirûr inscription of

the same date. I have found it used in various other records of his time in the Kanarese country. It was used very freely in the Rashtrakůța records of subsequent reigas, in all parts of their dominions. And I do not hesitate to decide that the explanation of the present date is to be found in connection with that aystem of reckoning, and that the expression on d-uttarain, presented in this record, is the abbreviation of a full expression which would be ond uttaran=aruvattaneya varsham, “ the sixtieth year increased by one." I have not overlooked the possibility of the eleventh, twenty-first, thirty-first, forty-first, or fifty-first year being intended. But it is difficult to recognise anything rational in an elliptical expression being used for any of those years. On the other hand, with a ogole of sixty years actually in use, and elliptical method of designating years in excess of the number of sixty, in such a case as this one, is perfectly intelligible and admissible. And I entertain no doubt that that is the method which was adopted in recording the date of the present record. This record is, therefore, to be placed roughly about A.D. 874-75. The palæography of the record is quite in agreement with this result. And the result is also thoroughly in accordance with the date in A.D. 897, whioh ig established by the prasasti of the Uttarapurina for Løkåditya, son of the Bankêya who is mentioned in this record.” 
The question remains, whether this explanation places the record in actually the sixty-first year of Amôghavarsha I., or whether it places it in the sixty-first san vatsara counted from, and including, the samvatsara in wbich his reign commenced. The two things are not exactly the same; because it happens that, in the period A.D. 814-15 to 877-78 covered by the reigu of Amoghavarsha I., there was an apparent or an actual omission of a saivatsaru. If the sañvatsaras were taken according to the so-called northern luni-solar system, then the year S.-S. 745 expired was the Subhakrit samvatsara, No. 36, and the year S.-S. 746 expired was the Krodhin samvatsara, No. 38, and there was an actual omission of the Sobhana samvatsara, No.37.If, on the other hand, they were taken according to the actual mean-sign system which underlay and governed the other system, then there was not an actual omission of that or any other samvatsara ; bat each of the sixty samvatsaras rau its full course, and there was only au apparent omission of Sôbhana, No. 37, presenting itself in the fact that the first day of the year S.-S. 745 expired fell in Sabbakrit, No. 36, while the first day of the year S.-S. 746 expired fell in Krðdhio, No. 38. It does not seem necessary to make calculations for the period A.D. 873 to 876, to determine the saivatsaras for those years according to the actual moan-sign system; especially, as Professor Kielhorn has arrived at the conclusion that the system then in use was the so-called northern luni-solar system.* It seems sufficient to state the following results. 
We have seen, on page 205, tlı:t Amôghavarsha I. began to reiga at some time from Å slådha śukla 1 of the Vijaya samvatsara, Saka-Samvat 736 expired, falling in May or June, A.D. 814, to Jyaishtha krislıņa 30 of the Jays saivatsara, S.-S. 737 expired, falling in June, AD. 815. The first samvatsara after a complete round of the san vatsaras would be, again, either Vijaya, S.-S. 795 expired, beginning, according to the so-called northern luni-solar system, iu A.D. 873 and ending in A.D. 874, or else Jaya, S.-S. 796 expired, beginning in A.D. 874 and euding in A.D. 875; and the record is to be placed in A..D. 873, 874, or 875. 
On the other hand, the actual sixty-first year of Amoghavarsha I, would commence on some day from Ashâdha sukla 1 of the Jaja sainvatsara, Saka-Sadavat 796 expired, in A.D. 874, to Jyaishtha krishna 30 of the Manmatha samvatsara, S.-S, 797 expired, in A.D. 875; and the record is to be placed in A.D. 874, 875, or 870. A more exact result cannot be arrived at, because the month and tithi, with the week-day or any other detail, are not specified.

Of the territorial divisions mentioned iu this record, the Banavasi twelve-thousand and tie Purigero three-hundred are already well known. The Nidugundage twelve was, of course; a group of villages headed by the modern Nidagundi itself. The position of the Kundarage seventy is probably marked by a village in the North Kanara district, the name of which is not given in the Indian Atlas sheet No. 42 (1827) but is sbewu in the Map of the Dhårwär Collectorate (1574), perbaps as a bamlet or deserted village, as "Koondurgee, one mile and a half east-by-south from Mandagôd in the Yellápur tåluka and nine miles west-by-worth from Nidagandi. The Beļgali three-hundred may be connected either with a village in the Bauka. pur taluka, which is shewn as “ Belgullee' in the Indian Atlas sheet No. 41 (1852), and is *Belugulee' in the Collectorate Map, four miles on the north of Shiggaon, and about eight miles north-by-east from Nidagundi, or with a village in the Hubli taluka, which is shewn as * Belgulee' in the Collectorate Map, but as · Bellaguttee' - (no doubt, by mistake for * Bellagullee') in the Atlas sheet No. 41, about geven and a half miles on the south of Hubli, and twenty-two miles towards the north-by-west from Nidagundi, The position of the Kundur five-hundred is a more difficult question. There is a village in the Bankápur talu ka, which is shewn in both the Atlas sheet No. 42 and the Collectorate Map as 'Koondoor,' deyen miles south south-east-half-south from Shiggaon, and five miles south-east from Nidagundi; but the close proximity of the Pânumgal or Hinungal five-hundred and the Purigere three-hundred distriots, reuders it difficult, if not impossible, to find room for a five-hundred district there. And there is also & Kundar somewhere in the Sirai tåluka of North Kanara ; but, if the Kundúr five hundred lay there, Baikêyarasa must have been governing also the Pânungal five-hundred, intervening directly between that locality and the Purigere three-hundred; whereas, the record does not mention the Pầuuugal five-hundred. A Kundûr five-hundred, however, appears to be mentioned elsewhere, in the passage in the Aminblåvi inscription of A.D. 1113, which, according to the transcription given in Sir Walter Elliot's Manuscript Collection, mentions the place an Ammaiyyanabhävi, and claims that, in the time of the Western Chalukya king Palakësin II., and in A.D. 506 or 567 (an altogether incorrect date), certain grants were made to the god Kalidêra of Ammaiyyanabhävi, which was an agrahāra in the Kundûr ilve-hundred of the Palasiga province (vishaya). Aminbhävi is about six miles north-north-east from Dhärvår, and about thirty miles on the east of Halsi, the ancient Palasige, in the Khânåpar t&laka. The position is a thoroughly suitable one for the Kundûr five-hundred district. And I think that we may safely take it that the Kundûr five-hundred of the present record is localised by the Aminbhåri record and included that village, though I cannot at present identify the town, Kundûr, from which the district took its appellation.

The family-name of the Rashtrakūtas of Mâlkhôd. To my previous paper on some of the records of the Rashtrakūta kings of Malkhed, in Vol. VI. above, p. 160 ff., I attached some notos on a few special points, chiefly in connection with the names, burudas, and other appellations of the various members of that family. Eventually, we shall consider some wider questions, such as the antiquity that may be assignert to the Rashtrakuța stack, the extraction of the Rashtrakûtas, the period and localities in which they first came to the front as a ruling power, and the distribution of thern in later times as indicated iv the first place by epigraphic records, and in the second place by the existence of tribes and clans who now claim to be of Rashtraküla descent. Meanwhile, I deal now with some more preliminary points. 
In line 13 of the Sirûr inscription of A.D. 866,4 as also in the corresponding passage in line 16 of the Nilgund inscription of the same date, the family-Dame of the Mâlkhêd dynasty is presented to us, in the formal prasasti or eulogy in Kanarese prose which introduces the practical details of the record, as Ratta, in the description of Amoghavarsha I. as Ratta-vars-odbhava, " born in the race of the Rattas, or in the Ratta race." And these two passages are the earliest known passages which present the name Ratta.

SOME RASHTRAKCTA RECORDS. 
AN 
In the records of the Malkhôd dynasty, the only other known instances in which the name occurs in the same form, Raçta, are the following. The two sets of Bagumrå plates of A.D. 915 speak, in a Sanskrit verse, of Ratta-rűjya," the kingdom, rule, or sovereignty of the Rattas;" and the game expression occurs again in the Dôlî plates of A.D. 940, in two Sanskrit verses, and again in the same to terses in the Karhad plates Of A.D. 959.3 Th: Bagumrå plates of A.D. 915 further apply to Indra III., again in Sanskrit verse, the brudır. Rattakandarpa, “a Kandarpa, Kâmua, or Lore of the Rattas ; "4 and the sama biruda is applied to Gôvinda IV. in a Kanarese verse in the Kalas inscription of A.D. 930,6 and to Khottiga ini Kanarese prose in the Adaraguschi inscription of A.D. 971,and to Indra IV. in Kanarese verses in the Sravana-Belgola illscription of A.D. 982.7 The Kalas inscription of A.D. 930, in the Kanarese prose passage which leads up to the date and other detuils of the record, further applies to Gôvinda IV. the biruda Rattavidyadhara, "a Vidyadhara or demigod of the Rattas. "H And the Dôôli plates of A.D. 340 introduce, in a Sanskrit vorse, the eponym Ratta, as the name of the imaginary person whom that record puts forward as the original ancestor of the family;9 and the same verse occurs in the Karhâd plates of A.D. 959.10 
In those of the other records of the Malkhêą dynasty which put forward the proper name of the fanily and do not refer to it as simply the race, family, or lineage of Yadu or of the Ladus,li the name is always given as Râshtrakūta. The Sámångad plates of A.D. 754 liken Indra II., in a Sanskrit verse, to sad-Råslitrakůça-lanakålri," a golden mountain (Méru) of the good Rashtrakūtas;"12 and we have the same verse in the Paithan plates of A.D. 794,2,3 in the Nausârî plates of A.D. 817,14 in the Kivî plates of A.D. 827, 15 in the Bagumri plates of A.D. 867,16 in the Chokkhakuți grant of A.D. 867,17 and in the Baguurâ plates, of doubtful authenticity, of A.D. 888.18 The Naugari plates of A,D. 817, in another Sanskrit verse, describe Dhruva as Rashtrakaja-tilakulin" an ornament of the Rashtrakûțas;"19 and this verse occurs again in the Kåvi plates of A.D. 827,20 in the Bagumrå plates of A.D. 867,41 in the Chokkbakuti grant of A.D. 867,2% and in the Bagumrâ plates, of doubtful anthenticity, of A.D. 888,28 The Baroda plates of A.D. 835 speak, in a Sanskrit verse, of sulkika-Rashtrakůļa, “tributary Rashtrakūtas ;"24 and the same verse is presented in the Bagumrå plates of A.D. 867,96 in the

And the Kalas inscription of A.D. 9308 describes Gôyinda IV., in & Kanarese verse, as Rashtrakút-êttame, "a best of the Râshtrakūtas." The Wani plates of A.D. 807 mention the family, in a Sanskrit verse, as fri-Rishtrakút-anvaya, "the lineage of the glorious Rashtrakūtas ; " we have the same verse in the Rådhanpur plates of A.D. 808 ;& and tha inscription of probably the period A.D. 814-15 to 877-78 at the Daśâyetâra cave at Ellôrå, speaks, in another Sanskrit verse, of prakata-Rashtrakút-ânvaya, " the manifest, pæblio, or well-known lineage of the Rashtrakūtas." The Baroda plates of A.D. 812 speak, in a Sanskrit verse, of fri-Rashtrakút-dmala-vamsa, " the spotless race of the glorious Rashtrakūtas ;"I the D&oli plates of A.D. 940, and, following the same draft, the Karhâą plates of A.D. 959, again in a Sanskrit verse, speak of Rúshfrakúta-varsa," the race of the Rashtrakûças, or of Rashtra küta," and propose to account for the name by saying that the family derived it from the Dame of a certain imaginary) Râshtrakůța whom these records put forward as the son of the eponymous Ratta. Finally, the Bagumrâ plates of A.D. 915 introduce the family, again in a Sanskpit verse, as fri-Rashtrakúto-kula, "the family of the glorious Rashtrakūtas; '9 and the same expression Råshtrakaça-kula, " the family of the Rashtrakūtas," is put forward, in ornate proge, in the Kadaba plates, lo which purport to have been issued in A.D. 813, but which are not of unquestionable authenticity. 
In the records of some other early branches of the same general stock, but only distantly connected, if actually connected at all, with the Malkhêd family, we find used only the form Râshtrakůţa. Thus, in Sanskrit prose, the Untikavâţikâ grant of Abhimanyu desoribes his first ancestor Mânån ka as Rashtrakútânän tilaka, "an ornament of the Rashtra kūtas.''ll A Sanskrit perse in the Multâi plates of A.D. 709 places Durgarâja, the first ancestor of Yuddhâsura-Nandarâja, fri-Rashtrakút-anyayê, “in the lineage of the glorious Rashtra kūtas."}}9 And a Sanskrit verse in the Ântroli-Ohhåróli plates of A.D. 757 describes Kakkarája I., the first ancestor of Kakkarája II., as fri-Rashtrakúta-kula-pankaja-shanda-súryQuy " sun of the group of water-lilies (blooming in the daytime) which is the family of the glorious Rashtrakütas.'')} 
In later extraneous records which mention the Malkhôd family, we find the follow ing usage. A Sansksit verse in an Eastern Chalakya copper-plate record of the period A.D. 918 to 925 describes Vijayaditya II. (A.D. 799 to 843) as fighting during twelve years, by day and by night, a hundred and eight battles with the armies of the Gangas and the Rattas; and a subsequent Sanskrit verse in the same record says that Vijayaditya III. (A.D. 844 to 888), prompted by the lord of the Rattas, conquered the Gangas, and cut off the head of Mangi in battle, and frightened Krishna and Sankila, and completely burnt their city.

records, the Rashtrakûţa territory, which, however, had by that time passed into the hands of the Western Châlukyas of Kalyani, is called, in Tamil prose, the Ilaţtapâți and Iraçtapadi seven-and-a-half-låkh (country), in which appellation the name stands for Rattapaời, “ the country of the Rattas,' and Irattama ndala, “the territory of the Rattas."| The Bhâdåna Silâhåre grant of A.D. 997 speaks, in a Sanskrit verse, of the once flourishing Rattamajya or " sovereignty of the Rattas " as then existing only in memory, and further on, in Sanskrit prose, ases the same word in mentioning the downfall and destruction of the family, consequent on the overthrop of Kakka II 3 The Khârêpatan Silâhåra plates of A.D. 1008 speak, in a Sanskrit verse, of Ráshfrakút-ésvarứndin vanéa, “the rate of the Rashtrakůta lords," and further on, in Sanskrit prose, describe the Western Châlakya king Irivabedaóga-Satyášraya as ruling over Raçta påţi or " the country of the Rattas."4 And the Kauthêr Western Chalukya plates of A.D. 1009, in Saáskřit verses, speak five times of the Rashtrakūtas, and Rashtrakúta-kula or " the family of the Râshtrakūtas," and also present once the other form Ratta, in referring to Bham maha-Katta or “ the Ratta Bhammaha," whose daughter Jákavvå became the wife of Taila II. 
In the later extraneous records, there are many other references to the Rashtrakûtas uf Malkhed, of which some speak of them as Rashtrakûtas, but the majority call them Rattas. We need not pursue those references any further. But we must note the usage in respect of the farnily name, in connection both with the Rashtrakůțas of Malkhed and with the Rattas of Saundatti, in the records of the feudatory Ratta princes of Saundatti, who ruled over the Kündi three thousand province which lay in the territory that had belonged to the Rashtrakůta kings of Málkhôd, and who, in their later records, are represented as belonging to the same lineage with those kings. In these Ratta records, as far as they have been explored, the name Rashtrakůta is but rarely met with. An inscription at Bail-Hongal, probably referable to the period A.D. 1041 to 1068 but perhaps to be placed about a century later, presents the name of the family of apparently the Ratta princes as Rashtrakūta.7 An inscription at Saundatti, put together in A.D. 1096 or soon after, speaks, in Kanarese prose, in a passage which presents wrongly the date of A.D. 875-76, of a king Krishnarajadêya, by whom it means Krishna III., and describes him ag Rishtrakúta-kula-tiļaka, "an ornament of the family of the Rashtrakūtas." The Têrdal inscription, which was put together in A.D. 1187, includes a passage dated in A.D. 1122 which applies to the prince Kårtavirya II., in Kanarese prose, the epithet Rashtrakút-anvaya-sirah sikhdmani, "a crest-jewel on the head that was the lineage of the Râshtrakūtas."9 And the Sanndatti inscription of A.D. 1228 desoribes the prince Lakshmideva II., in a Kanarese verse, as Roshtrakút-anvaya, “belonging to the lineage of the Rashtrakūtas,"l0 But, with the above exceptions, the Ratta records, including even the records of A..D. 1096, 1187, and 1228 mentioned above, always present the name as Ratta, or, using a variant of the name written with the Dravidian f, as Ratta. The earliest certain record of the Ratta princes, the Sogal inscription

The Saundatti inscription, dated in December of the same year, of the Baisa prince Sântivarman, speaks in Kanarese verses, with reference it may be to the Rashtrakūtas of Mälk hêd, or it may be to some earlier members of the Ratta family of Saundatti,? of Ratta-ku?-cintaya-nzipar, " the kings of the lineage of the family of the Rattas," and, with the Dravidian r, of Rattar, "the Kattag."3 The Mantar inscription of A.D. 1040 presents a formal prasasti of the usual kind in Kanarebe proge, introductory to the practical details of the record, in which it applies to the prince Erage Ereyammarasa the epithet Ratta-uams-6db7wva, "born in the race of the Rattas," and the birida Rattamartanda, “a sun of the Rattas;" and, in Kanarese verses, it gives him the bij rusila Rattanáråyaņa, ka Narayaņa of the Rattas," in addition to repeating the birude Rattamartanda ; And it further speaks, in Kanarese prose, of a tank called Rattahamudra. The Kanarese inscription in the temple of Arkaleśvara or Ankuśêśvara, at Sanndatti, 6 in the passage if AD. 10+8 describes Nanna, the father of Kärtavirya I., in verse as Rotta-kul-dibara timmarochi, " a sun of the sky whicb is the family of the Rattas," and speaks of Dayima in verse as Ratara Mêru Dutyáma, “ Dayima, a Mêru of the Rattas ;96 and it uses the same form of the name twice morc, in verse and prose, in connection with Anka in that passage, and once again in the passage of A.D. 1087, in which it describes Kârtavirya II., in a formal prose prasusti, as Ratta-kulat-kamala-nörttanda, "a sun of the water-lily (blooming in the daytime) which is the family of the Rattas." Another inscription at Saundatti, of the period A.D. 1069 to 1070, describes the princc Kartavirya II., in the formal prasasti in Kanarese prose, ag Ratta.mile turuju-vana-murtanda, “a su of the group of water-lilies (blooming in the daytime) which is the family of the Rattas," and, in giving his pedigree, uses the same verse that stands in the record of A.D. 1043, and styles his ancestor Dayima, in a Kanarese verse, Rattara Dêru Duyima, " Dayima, Et lêl'u of the Rattas."7 The Sanndatti inscription, put together in A.D. 1096 or thereabouts, which has been quoted above as presenting the name Rashtrakůţa in connection with Krishna III., describes the prince Kârtavirya II., in the formal prasasti in Kunarese prose, as Ratta-kuula bhushana, " an ornament of the family of the Rattas," and, in tracing his descent, describes his ancestor Kârtavirya I., in a Sanskrit verse, as Ratta-vais-ôdbhara, “ born in the race of the Ratcas." The Thrdâl inscription, put together in A.D. 1187, which bas been quoted above as presenting, in a passage dated in A.D. 1122, the name Rashtrakûţa in connection with the prince Kârtavirya II., styles him, in the formal prasasti in Kanarese prose, Raffa-kula-bhúshana, h an ornament of the family of the Rattas.". The Kalhole inscription of A.D. 1204 describes the prince Sdna II., in a Kanarese verse, as Ratt-ánvaya-Sri-nétra," the eye of Fortune in the shape of the lineage of the Rattas," and applies the biruda Rattanårâyaņa, “ a Narayana of the Rattas," to Kärtavirga IV., again in a Kanarese vorse, and then, in the formal prasasti in Kanarese proge, styles him, as usual, Rafta-kula-bhushana "an ornament of the family of the Rattas.")0 I'lle Blój plates of A.D. 1208 speak of the family of the princes, in a Sanskrit verse, as Raff-áhvayo

The Nêsargi inscription of A.D. 1218 uses, throughout the variant. of the name which presents the Dravidian ?; in Kanareso verses, it speaks of the Mâlkhed kings as Ratt-cintayar: “ those who were of the lineage of the Raçtas," and of their family as Raffa vansa, " the race of the Rattas," and Ratta-kuibu, “ the family of the Rattas," and of the family of the princes of Saundatti as Rutta-vamsa," the race of the Rattas." The Saundatti inscription of A.D. 1228, which has been quoted above as próscating the name Rashtrakūta in connection Tith the prince Lakshmidêva II., further speaks of hin, in a preceding Kanarese verse, as Rattu pams.odbhava, “ born in the race of the Rattas," and uses, also in Kavarese verses, and in con neotion with the princ s, the expressions Ratta-rajya, “ the rule of the Rattas," and Raffarija and Ratt-örvipa," the Ratta kings;" and in the formal prasasti, in Kanarese prose, it styles Lakshmidêva II., as usual, Ratta-kula-bhúshana, “ an ornament of the family of the Rattas.»3 And a inscription at Hannikere or Hannikëri, put together in A.D. 1257,4 uses, throughout, the variant of the name with the Dravidian ?, and presents the name of the family of the kings of Malkhed as Rafta-vamsa, “ the race of the Rattas," in « Kanarese verse, and as Ratt-drvaya, "the lineage of the Rattas," in Kaparese prose, and describes the prince Kårtavirya III., in Kanarese prose, as Rata-kuba-bhúshana, "an ornament of the family of the Rattas," and his 800 Lakshmidåva II., in a Kauarese verse, as Ratta-kul-agranz, "a leader of the family of the Rattas." 
The form Ratta, with the Dravidian 1, has not as yet been found in any records of the Råshtrakůta kings of Mâlkhed. It is met with, first, in the Saundatti record of A.D. 980. But, from the other instances given above, it does not seem to have been used at all freely until about the beginning of the thirteenth century A.D. It was not always used even then, It became, however, 80 well established and well known a form of the name, that we find it used also in extraneous records, and in the Nagari characters, though a special device had to be adopted to represent it in that alphabet. That device was the doubling of the ordinary Nagari r, with the result of presenting the name as Rratta, without, however, producing a double consonant strong enough to lengthen a precediog short vowel. And we have the name in this forin in a Sanskrit verse in the Haralaballi plates of A.D. 1238, whiclı contain a Davagiri-Yadava record, and again

And the same means was used in the word Rratta, quoted above from the Behagti plates of A.D. 1253, and again in mdrra-kd mdu, fur mara-kondu, in the Kallarese passage, given in Nagari charactere, at the end of the Béhatti Kalachurya plates of A.D. 1183 (Ind.

in the same verge in the Behatti plates of A.D. 1253, which contain another Dêragiri-Yadava record. 
That the family-name of the princes of Saundatti, who raled the Kündi three-thousand province, was Ratta, not Râshtrakata, is unmistakable. And it is also quite plain that, while Rashtrakuta was the formal appellation which it was customary to apply to the kings of Målkhed in ornate language, the real practical form of their family-name was Ratta 
This is made clear, in one way, by the fact that Ratta is the name that was used in forming those birudas, or secondary appellations of the kings, of which the family-name was & com. ponent, and of which we have at present instances dating from A.D. 915 and onwards; namely, Rattakandarpa in the cases of Indra III., Gòvinda IV., Khottiga, and Indra IV., and Rattor vidyadhara in the case of Govinda IV. But it is made clear in other ways also. In the records of the Malkhêd family, except in the case of the Kadaba plates which are not of unquestionable authenticity, the appellation Rish traků ta is found only in Sanskrit verges, in those parts of the records which were introductory to the passages containing the practical details of the records, and were devoted to exhibiting the pedigree, reciting the achievements, and generally magnifying the importance of the kings, in the principal literary language of the time. And even in the record put forward in the Kadaba plates, where the appellation occurs in prose, the passage is in ornate prose of an elaborate and stilted kind, or, as Dr. Lüders has styled it, in “exceedingly rich and flowery language." The name Ratta appears first in the Sirůr and Nilgand iuborip tions of A.D. 866. And in them it is presented, not in de Sanskrit verse, but in the Kanarese prose prasasti which in troduces the practical details of the records. At about that time, there arose a practice of presenting compositions, which did not even include excerpts from the early standard drafts such as we have in the case of verses 1 and 2 in the Sirûr record and verses 2 and 3 in the Nilgund record, but which departed altogether from the early standard drafts, and were also liable to be independent even of each other. The composers of those later records indulged in various liberties, which had not been allowed to the composers of the earlier records. And, in the drafts presented in the Cambay plates of A.D. 930 and the Sângli plates of A.D. 933 and the Kharda plates of A.D. 972, the real name of the family, in either form, was actually suppressed altogether, and the members of the dynasty were simply allotted, in connection with their then recently elaborated Puriņic pedigree, to “the race of the Yadus" or "the lineage of Yadu." It was only in those later compositions that the habit crept in, of using the pame Ratta in Sanskrit verses. And, even then, a kind of apology was made for using the more practical form of the name in the more ornate parts of the records. That the truda Rattakandarpa, in the case of Indra III., should be used in a Sanskrit perge, in the Bagamrå records of A.D. 915, in that practical form and without being metamorpliosed into Rashtrakûts kandarpa, is natural enough. But it is found rather far on in the record. And the composer of the draft presented in those two sets of plates was careful to introduce the dynasty by its more stately appellation of "the family of the Rashtra kû tas," before he proceeded to speak of " lho kingdom or sovereignty of the Rattas " and to bring the biruda Rattakandarpa into one of his verges. So, also, the draft presented in the Déôli plates of A.D, 940 and the Karhåd. plates of A.D. 959 introduces the dynasty as the race of the Rashtrak@tas," before it, again, speaks of "the kingdom or sovereignty of the Rattas," and these two drafts, presented to us first in records of A.D. 915 and 940, emphasise the point that Ratta was the real and practical form, and Rishtrakûta was the ornamental or stately form, of the family-name. Saob are the facts. But the Rattas of Malkhêd have come to be familiarly known as the Råsh feito kütas of Malkhed, because that form only of their name is presented at all prominently in

their various records which were published before the time when the Sirûr inscription came to notice. And, for parposes of easy discrimination, it will be desirable to continue the use of that appellation, and to speak still, as hitherto, of the Rashtrakûța kings of Malkhôd and the Ratta princes of Saundatti. 
We bave now to consider which of the two names, Ratta and Råshtrakúţa, was evolved from the other name, and how it was done. 
And, in the first place, it is to be remarked that we have beon told by Mr. Pathak that "the word ratta, according to Trivikrama, is a Pråkpit form of the Sanskřit rashtra."! I lieve, however, been assured, by the very best authority, that Trivikrama does not give in his grammar any rale at all about the word rashtra, and that the word ratta has not been found in Prakrit literature. And, as far as our actual knowledge goes, the forms which the Sanskrit word råshtra, a country,' would assume in the Pråkrits, are rattha, ratha and rata. We have the form rattha in Sarattha, Suråsh tra, and Sôrattha, = Saurashtra, which instances Professor Pischel has given me from, respectively, Hémachandra, 2, 34, and Trivikrama, 1, 4, 14; and the use of it evidently underlies the Jaina-Maharashtri, Saurasêni, and Apabhramsa word Marahattha, for Maharaţtha, Mahârâshļra, and the Mahåråsbţri word Marahatthi, for Maharatthi, = Mahîm råsh tri. In Pali, we have the independent word rattha itself, rashtra, in the sense of 'king dom, realm, country, land, district.' And, in epigraphy, we have Sátáhani-ratthe, " in the province of Sátáhani.' We have the form ratha, in epigraphy, in Suratha, = Surâshtra, in one of the Nâsik inscriptions of Palumáyi. And we have the form rata, attributable 10 doabt to the tendency to avoid aspirates in the Dråviậian languages, in Sorata; = Sauråshtra, which is given as an instance of the changes of au to o and of shț tot in the illustrations of Kesiranja's Kanarese Sabdamanidarpana, sůtras 270, 283,9 So far, no authority can be obtained for saying that the form ratta, = råshtra, 'country,' actually occurs. However, according to the Sabdamanidarpanai, sůtra 283, the Sanskrit sht may become t, as well as t, in Kanarese; and there are cases, such as duţta, dushta, sitri, = sȚishți, and ittige, = ishtaka, in which that change has occurred. And so, algo, in the Prakrit languages technically so called, while the Sanskrit sht usually becomes ith, there are some cases in which it has become it; as, for instance, in utta, = ushtra, and a few other words. And we are, therefore, pot prepared to say that the form ratta, rashtra, may not be found to ocour, though it was not taught by Trivikrama, and though we cannot at present quote any instance of it. 
Bat the name Ratta was certainly not obtained from the word xâsbtra, or from the name Bashtrakûţa. The family-name, in its Sanskrit form, was, not Råshtra, but Rashtrakdta. There was no name Råshtra, from which to obtain the name Ratta. From the name Rashtrakuta we obtain, by corruption, in the most natural manner, Råshtroda, actually presented in a Verawal inscription of A.D. 1384, which speaks of Rashtrôd a-vamsa, " the race of the Råshtrodas," and describes it as a third race famous like the Solar and Lanar Races ;9 and we shall not he

surprised, if we meet hereafter with epigraphic instances of further corruptions such as Ratthoda and Rathoda, of which forms the last is actually the moderii name which in gazetteers, cto., is presented as · Ráthor' and 'Ráhtor.' But, in the name Råsh trôda, the second component, ktița, of Rashtrakûta, is duly represented. Whereas, in the name Ratta there is nothing whatever to represent that second component of the other name. And, for that reason we cannot admit Ratta as a corruption of, or in any way obtained from, the name Rashtrakúta. 
It can only be the case that the name Rashtrakûţa was evolved out of the name Ratta, And, that that was the case, is unconsciously disclosed by the draft presented in the Deõli plates of A.D. 940 and the Karhâd plates of A.D. 959, in the verse which puts forward the eponymous person Ratta as the imaginary original ancestor of the Mâlkhêd family, and asserts that he had a son named Rashtrakuţa, and says that it was from the name of that son that the family became known as the Rashtrakúța race, or the race of Råshtrakûța or of the Rashtrakūtas. But the name Råshtraků ta is certainly not merely a Sanskritisod form of nothing but the name Ratta; for the simple reason that in Ratta there is nothing to account for the component kúta in tho other form of the name. The name Ratta does account for the first component, ráshtra. It does not, however, &ccount for it in the way of having been literally translated by the word ráshtra. The explanation is that, in devisiog an ornamental form of a name, Ratta, which, whatever may have been the origin of it, did not mean a country,' there was used, not unnaturally, a Sanskrit word, rashtra, which was the actual representative and origin of words of very similar sound, such as ralphu, ratha, and rata, possibly even ratta itself, if the existence of that form shonld be established hereafter,-- which did possess that meaning. There was thus obtained, as the first step, a name Râshtra. But it seems to have been then recognised that the appellation thus obtained was not suficiently high-sounding, and that something more was needed to adapt it better to the purposes for which it was wanted. Now, the word kûta has the meaning, among others, of 'the highest, most excellent, first, derived no doubt from its meanings of any prominence, a peak or summit of a mountain.' In literature, it occurs in that meaning in the Bhagavatapurána, 2, 9, 19, where Bhagayat (Vishņu-Krishna) is represented as addrossing Brahman as kúţa yðginan, "O chief of ascetics !" In the epigraphic records, it is used in the same meaning in the official title grứmakúga,' a chief or headman of a village, and also actually in the word ráshtrakú tu as an official title meaning the headman of a berritorial division technically known as a rashtra.' The word kúţa, in that same meaning, was plainly employed in making ap the full family-name Râshtrakūta. And the use of it, to fill out, and give sufficient pomp to that form of the name, was very probably suggested by the actual existence of the word rushfrakûça as an official title. But we need not think, any longer, that the name

is itself tho official title, or that, like the olicial title, it means ' a headman of a ráshtrit.'l It woy plainly intended to mean "highest, most excellent, chief's, or leaders, of the Rattas.' 
It may be added that both the original family-name Ratta, and its ornate formu Râshtra küta, came to be afterwards used as personal names. Thus, the Khårópiațau plates of A.D. 1008 mention & Silâhîra prince named Ratta and Rattaraja ;' and Hênachandra mentions in his Paribasitaparran a man named Rashtrakûţa. It inny also be remarked that Kaihana has asserter the existence of a queuil of the Dekkan), of Karnâţa extraction, named Ratta, allegei to have been a contemporary of Lalitäditya of tho Karköta dynasty of Kashmir; but there can be no doubt that Dr. Stein has rightly explained the passage, not as establishing the real existence of any such queen, but as presenting a personification of the dynasty of the Rashtrakůtag of Malkhea, 
The original home of the Rashtrakūtas of Malkhêd. In line 13 of the Sirur inscription of A.D. 866, and in lino 16 of the Nilgund inscription of the same date, Amôghavarsha L. is described as Lattulúra-pura-paraméscara, "supieme lord of the town of Lattalûra." The same town is mentioned, sometimes as Latitalûr and sometimes As Lattanir, in also the records of the Ratta princos of Saundatti; for instance, the Mantür inscription of A.D. 1040 describes Eraga-Ureyammarasą as Lattalar-purarar-észarit, “lord of Lattalür, a best of towns, an excellent town, a chief town," and the Bhôj plates of A.D. 1208 Jesorilse Kartavirya IV., and the Saundatti inscription of A.D. 1228 describes Laksh midêra II., as Lattanúrpuravar-aliscard, " supreme lord of Lattan ûr, a best of towns." And in these epithets we have, in various forms, a hereditary title commemorative of the place which the Rashtrakůta kings of Malkhôd, and, after them, the Ratta princes of Saundatti, who, according to some of their later rocords, belonged to the same lineago with those kings. - claimed as their original home. The name of the town is further presented to us in a transitional form in the Sitàbaldi inscription of A.D. 1087, which applies the epithet Latalanra-vinărgata, "come forth or emigrated from Latalaura," to a foudatory of the Western Chalukya king Vikrani aditya VI., namely to the Maluistimanta Dhàdibhada ka or Dhidibhandaka, also called the Rangka Dhadiadora, whom it further describes as mahd-Rashtrakút-invaya-prasúta, " born in the great lineage of the Rashtrakūtas, or in the lineage of the great Rashtrakūtas;" and the record applies 
1 There would, bowever, not have been anything derogatory even in that derivation of the name. The name of the well known Andhrabhrityn kings is explained as having taken its origin from the fact that the first of them laad been a servant (thritya) of the Andurag. And there was a family of kings who referred themselves to a lineage known as the Gurjara pratihâra lineaga (see Vol. III. above, p. 263), evidently because their ancestors had been doorkeepers of the Gurjaras.

By & printers mistake, not noticed at the time, the published text of the Bhoj record gives the name of the town, in line 86-87, As Láttanúr, with the long d, instead of the short ay in the fint syllable. The necessary correction should be made. At present, I cannot trace back the use of this title to any date before A.D.' 1040 in records which belong unquestionably to the Rattas of Saundatti. The Kalasapur inscription of A.D. 983, of the time of the Rashtrakůta king Govinda IV., does, indeed, mention a Mandidmanta whom it describes as Latt aldr-pura-paramdéonra and as trivaļi.pareghoshana ; and it is practically certain that he was a Ratça : but the original record is grently damaged, and I cannot reongnise, in the ink-impression, either his Dame, or any epithet which specifically refers him to the lineage of the Rattag. The Sogal inscription of the Ratta prince Kartavirya I., of July, A.D. 980, does not seem to make any mention of Lattalür. And it may be added that the town is certainly not mentioned in the Sundatti inscription, of December of that same year, of the Vandadmanta Såntivarman (Jour. Bo. Br. R. As. 800.

The town Lattalûr or Lattanûr may, or may not, have been in the territory of the Rashtrakūtas of Malkhed. By a similar title, the Western Ganga princes of Talakid were styled Kovalıila-puravar-ésvara, " lord of Kovaļāla, the best of towns." Here, the allusion is to the town now known as Kolar, the chief town of the Kôlir district in the east of Mysore. And that town certainly was in the Western Ganga territory. So, also, the Kâdamba princes of Hảngal had the hereditary title of Banavasi-puravar-ådlistara, "supreme lord of Banavåsi, the best of towns."3 And they sometimes had the administration of the Banavasi province. But their hereditary authority was confined to the Pånumgal five-hundred province : the Banayisi province proper was a crown property, administered from time to time by whomsoever the paramount sovereign might appoint; it was only by special appointment that it,. with also some neighbouring districts, was occasionally held by the Kâdambas of Hângal; and they used the title simply because they claimed descent from the early Kadamba kings, whose capital was Banawasi. These are the only two instances, that I can recall, in which a hereditary title of the kind thut we are considering was more or less connected with actual territorial authority. The same title, * supreme lord of Banavisi, the best of towns," was used by the Kadamba princes of Goa, who had no authority whatever at Banawagi, and simply derived the title in the same way as did the Kâdambas of Hångal. The Kalacharya kings of Kalyani in the Nizam's Dorninions had the hereditary title of Kalánjara-(for Kalanjara)-puravar-dhisvara, - gupreme lord of Kalaujara, the best of town,'5 simply in connection with the legend that referred the origin of their family to Kalañjar in Bundelkhand, Central India, a long way outside their own territory. The Gatta princes of Guttal, whose power was usually limited to quite a small part of the Dharwår district, used the title Ujjayani-puravar-adhisvara, "supreme lord of Ujjayani, the best of towns," for which in one passage there is substituted "supreme lord of Påtali, the best of towns, Brow simply because their traditions or legends connected them with the Early Guptas and the mythical king Vikramadityau, and consequently with the far distant Ujjain in Mâlwa and Pâtaliputra-Påtna in Bebau. By similar titles, the Silâhâra princes of the Northern Konkan styled themselves Tayara-pura-parancêsvara, " supreme lord of the town of Tagara,"? and their relatives who ruled at Karlåd styled themselves T'agara-puravar-adhiávara, "supreme lord of Tagara, the best of towns;", though Tagara, which is the modern Têr in the Naldrug distriot of the Nizani's Dominions, was at a very appreciable distance, a hundred miles at least, from any part of the provinces to which their authority was confined. And the Yadaya princes of the Seuņa country, which was the territory of which the chief town was Dêvagiri-Daulatâbâd, used the title Dváravati-pura-paraméscara, "supreme lord of the town of Dvârayati,"10 which, in the form Ducirárati-puratar-ådhisvara, “ supreme lord of Dvârå vatî, the best of towns," was taken over

But, whereas the allusion here is to Dvaravati, Dvårâvatî, or Dvârakâ, which is the modern Dwårkå at the Western extremity of Kåtbiâwâr, the Yådava princes of the Säuña country certainly never ruled at Dwarki or over any part of Kathiå wår. The title was only set up by them in connection with their olain to belong to the Lunar Race, and to be descended from the god Vishnu, who, in his incarnation as Krishna, made Dwårká his capital. sod, that they simply claimed Dwarka as their traditional place of origio, is explicitly shewn by a passage in the Bassein plates of A.D. 2069 which says in respect of Dridhaprahåra, whom it puts forward as the original founder of the family, that “he, in the beginning, came from the city (pattana) of Dvârâvatî” to the territory, in the Nåsik district and the Nizam's Dominions, which his descendants were ruling at the time when the record was drawn up, “and made famons in the world the town of Chandrådityapura, which had already sprang into existence.") From all these facts, we can see plainly that these hereditary titles, presenting the names of ancient towns, put forward only assertions as to places of origin, and not claims to actual local authority, and that, to take a specific instance, the title Lattalúra-pura-paramêsvara, "supreme lord of the town of Lattalûra," which we have in tho Sirůr and Nilgund rocords, is nothing but a more dignified and ostentatious method of conveying the exact idea which is expressed by the Latalaura-vinirgata, " come forth or emigrated from Latalaura," of the Sitabaldi inscription. 
An identification of the town Lattalûr, Lattanûr, or Latalaura, has not yet been estab lished. I have, indeed, suggested that it might not impossibly be found in the town kuown as Ratanpur, in the Bilaspur district, Central Provinces ; 5 because the letters and » are often interchanged, and so it would not be difficult to derive the name Ratanpur from the full form Lattanúrpura. That suggestion, however, was based chiefly on the fact that we find traces of ralers calling themselves Råshtrakūtas in various parts of India far to the north of the territory of the Rashtrakūtas of Malkhêd. And it is not, really, in any way sustainable ; because the name Ratanpur has been simply obtained by transposition from Ratnapura, as is shown by a record of A.D. 1114 at Ratanpur itself. I cannot at present quote any epigraphic references to Lattalar, exoept from the records of the Râshtrakatas of Malkhed and the Raçtas of Saundetti, and from the Sitåbaldi inscription. Nor can I find it mentioned by any ancient geographer or traveller, or in any Purána or other work. But we are certainly concerned with a southern locality. And, wbile not asserting a final identification of Lattalür, I would indicate a place in respect of which it seems worth while that some precise inquiries should be made. That place is 
town in the Bidar district of the Nizam's Dominions, which is shewn as "Latur' in the Indian Atlas Sheet No. 56 (1845), in lat. 18° 24', long. 76° 38', and in Thacker's Reduced Survey Map of India by Bartholomew (1891). In Philip's Gazetteer of India by Ravenstein (1900), it is treated as · Lathur, or Latur,' and is credited with a population of 9,063. It seems to have been, not long ago, of more importance than at present; for, Murray's Encyclopedia of Geography (1844) 
1 It is applied to the first king, Bhillama, in an inscription of his time, dated in A.D. 1183, at Muttagi in the Bijapur district. I quote from an ink-impression.

Part I. p. 7) that the name of the Lata country, in Gujarat, was derived from the name of some local tribe, "perhaps the Lattas" (read, obviously, Lattas), who might possibly, through the interchange of land y, be identified with the Rattas or Rashtrakūtas, and that Laftalura (sic) may bave been in Låta and may have given its name to bolo toe cou It is dificult, however, to look on this seanything except an early crude speculation, which the Pandit himself would not have incorporated in any final presentation of his more mature viewa.

Ter, Latur ' is in that part of the Dekkan, watered by the Gôdåvarî and its tributaries, which has been indicated by Dr. Bhandarkar as a favourite region of early Aryan settlement and it is, in fact, only about twenty-eight miles east-by-north from Têr, and three miles south of the 
Manjera,' which is au important feeder of tihe Gôdåvarî. And I strongly suspect that local inquiries would result in finding that " Latur" is the ancient Irattalûr, Lattanür. If so, there will, perhaps, be found at · Latur' some notable teniple or remains of such a temple, either of the gaddess Durgå in the form of Châmundà, or of Vishnu in the form of the man-lion, or possibly temples of both those deities; since the Sitâbaldi inscription further describes Dhådi. bliadaka as she who obtained favour by a boon of (the goddess) Chamunda," and Vasudeva as "he who obtained favour by a boon of (the god) Narasimha.'3 
The matter must, of course, depend a good deal upon what is the actual spelling of the modern name which the maps and gazetteers present as 'Latur, Lathur, and Lattoor. We need not trouble ourselves about the h which appears in one of these forms; it is a& easily accounted for here, as in some other instances referred to by mo elsewhere. For the resti, I feel no doabt that inquiries on the spot would shew that the real name is Lâtûr, with a long d followed by a single dental ti And, if that is so, the modern name is distinctly derivable from the ancient name, through steps the rules for some of which have been giveu to no by Professor Pischel. We start with the form Lattalûra, of A.D. 866, of which Lattanir, appearing first at present in A.D. 1208, is plainly only an optional variant attributable to the interchangeability of 7 and 1.5 The first step would be the dropping of one ť in the second syllable, which would give us Latalûra, and eventually the Latalaura which we actually have in the Sitåhaldi inscrip tion. The next step would be the omission of the short a of the second and final syllables, which would give us Latiûr. The next step would be the assimilation of the 7 to the preceding to which would give us Lattûr. And, finally, the nexus tt would be dissolved into the simple thg and the preceding short a would be lengthened by way of compensation ;8 and this would give us the ultimate form Låtür.

The banners and crests of the Rashtrakūtas of Malkhed and of the Rattas of 
Saundetti. The difference between the lañchhana or crest, which was the device used on the seals of copper-plate charters,l occasionally at the tops of inscriptions on stone, and on coins, and the dhvaja or banner, has been explained, with instances, in my Dynasties of the Kanarese Districts, in the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Vol. I. Part II., p. 299, note 4. 
The Rashtrakûtas of Malkhôd had the pâļidhyaja banner and the Garudalúžchhuna or Garuđa crest, which are mantioned in, for instance, lines 9 and 13 of the Sirûr inscription of A.D. 866, E., page 206. And it would appear, from a passage in the Adapurina of Jinasena, that the pålidhvaja pas a particular arrangement, in rows, of a thousand and eighty flags, 
wa hundred and eight flags of each of ten kinds of flags bearing, as there specified, the devices of garlands, cloths (?), peacocks, water-lilies, geese, eagles, lions, bulls, elephants, and wheels; see Ind. Ant. Vol. XIV. p. 104 f. 
The Rattas of Saundatti, on the other hand, had the suvarna Garudadhvaja, or banner of a golden Garuda, and the sindůralañchhana or sendüralüschhanu, the red-lead crest. 
Their lañchhana is mentioned in the records editod by me in the Jour. Bo. Br. 2. ds. Soc. Vol. X. pp. 194 to 286, in my translations of which I treated it as the mark of vermilion. Subsequently, however, the expression sindůra-ldchhanan, for sindúra-lúñchhanaw, in line 43 of the inscription at Têrdal, was translated by Mr. Pathak as meaning "who has the device of an elephant. To this there was attached a note, telling us vaguely that, "according to Kedirâja, sindhura is changed into sindura."* And, 'accepting that statement, I translated sindura-la[n]chhanan in the Mantür inscription of A.D. 1040,and sindura-lancichhanas in the Bhoj plates of A.D. 1208,by "who has the crest of an elephant;" and I have taken it 88 established that the Rattas of Saundatti had the elephant crest. Since that time, howeyor, I have gradually learnt that, even apart from his habit of often not stating chapter and verse for his assertions, so that it is sometimes difficultor impossible to test them, the person who made that statement about the meaning of sindura in this combination, is by no means to be accepted implicitly. He has misled us in this matter. And, as happens not infrequently, the process of setting things right cannot be made as brief as the enunciation of the assertion which has led us astray. 
On re-examining the Ratta records themselves, I find that they mention the creat by two words, sindura and sendura. I find the word sindura in the following cases : --My ink impression of the fragmentary inscription of Kärtavirya II. at Saundatti, of the period A.D. 1069 to 1076, sbewe distinctly sirdara-vámchchhanam, as given by me in Jour.

And the published facsimile lithographs of the Saundatti inscription of Lakshmidêva II. of A.D. 1228 ghewa distinctly simindúra-lámolhanar, as given by me, ibid. p. 268, text line 62. And I have the 
1 There were, however, exceptions to the rule. And, notably, the seal of the only Ratta copper-plate record which has come to light, the Bloi plates of A.D. 1208, appears to present, not their crest, but the baru WATCH was the device on their banner; see Ind. Ant. Vol. XIX. p. 249.

word sendûra in the following cases :-- My iuk-impression of the Saundatti inscription of A.D. 1096 or thereabouts shews that in line 24, where my published text, Jour. Bo. Br. R. As. Soc. Vol. X. p. 196, gives sindhura-lánchhonain, the original has sendúra-lunchhanam : the vowel of the first syllable is unmistakably e, é, not $; and in the second syllable the 32 and the are unnistakable, and the subscript consonant, somewhat blurred, either is an original d, or else is an original dl corrected into d. And my ink-impression of the inscription at the tample of Ankalêśvara or Ankusêsvara at Saundatti, which, though not published, has been mentioned by me elsewhere,' shews distinctly sendtra-lánchchhanai in line 24, in the description of Anka in the passage of A.D. 1048, and again in line 59, in the description of Kårta pîrya II. in the passage of A.D. 1087. 
We thus have, well established, the two forms sindûra and sendûra or sêndûra, both used in the Ratta records. And we have now to determine the meaning of the word. 
Now, we have in Sanskrit two words, sindhura, with the aspirated dh and the short , meaning an elephant,' and sindūra, with the unaspirated d and the long t, meaning 'red lead, minium, vermilion,' and ' a particular kind of tree or plant. 
Dr. Kittel's Kannada-English Dictionary (1894) gives sindhûra, with the long d but still with the aspirated dr, as a variant of sindhura, and only with the meaning of an elephant." His authority for it is the Nanirtharatrzıilarat, 26. I am not able to examine that work. But I notice that Gangadhar Madiwaleshwar Tuimari's Kanarese Vocabulary (1869) gives sinchúra, with the long # and the aspirated dh, with the meanings both of elephant' and of ka kunna, "saffron,' the use of which for certain purposes was much the same as the use of sindúra; and, further, it brackets simdhura, with the short u, in guch a way as to attribute to it, also, the meaning of kusikuma, for which, however, I cannot trace any other authority. And 80, also, Reeve and Sanderson's Canarese Dictionary (1858) gives sindhura and sindhira, with both the short u and the long û and with the aspirated dh, as meaning both red lead' and ' an elephant.' 
In addition to giving sandhûra as another form of sindhura, Dr. Kittel's Dictionary further presents sindura, with the short u and the unaspirated d, as a tadbhava-corruption of sindhura. The authority quoted for this is the Sabdamanidarpana of Késirâja, Dr. Kittel's own edition (1872), p. 339. And there, under the illustrations of sûtra 255, which teaches amongst other things the change of dh to d, we certainly have s sindhuran = sinduran." Hero, however, the short u is preserved; and the corruption of sindhura, thus presented, is not sirdúra with the long i. This corruption, sindura, is not given in Gangadhar Madiwalesbyar'a Vocabulary, or in Reeve and Sanderson's Dictionary. 
To the other word, sindura, Dr. Kittel's Dictionary assigns only the meaning of red lead, minium.' And, as tadbhava-corruptions of this word, it gives chandra (2), with chandara, Chondora (1) and chendira (1), and also sendura, with the short e and t, and søndůra, with the long é and ů, and both with the unas pirated d. Reeve and Sanderson's Dictionary does not include sendura or sendůra. Gangadhar Madiwaleshwar's Vocabulary does not present sendura or sendûra; but it does present somdhûra, with the long é and 4 and with the aspirated dh, as another form of sindúra. I do not find this last form anywhere else. 
For sên düra, as a corruption of sindúra, Dr. Kittel has quoted only Gangadhar Madiwa leshwar's Vooabulary. But, as I have just said, that Vocabulary presents, not sein düra with the unaspirated d, bat sêmdhûra with the aspirated dh. 
For sendura, as & corruption of sindúra, Dr. Kittel has quoted, with another dathority which I am not able to examine, the Sabdamanidarpana of Késirâja. his own edition (1872), p. 357. There, however, under the illustrations to sû tra 271 which teaches amongst other things that i becomes e, we have " sindhůrai = serdhuran." In respect of this, I can only say that

either it establishes sendhura (for which, however, I cannot find any other authority) as a corrup tion of sindhûr dig for sindluura, elephant,' or else, and more probably, it is a mistake for “ sindiran seri durarn," based on a habit which, Dr. Kittel has told me, the manuscripts have of not anfrequently presenting an aspirated instead of an unaspirated letter and vice versii. Beyond that, I can only say that Mr. Rice's Karnatakaðabdúnušásanam of Bhattakalankadêva (1890), p. 108, under the illustrations of sūtra 160, does give sendura as the corruption of sinuúra. 
So far, no authority has been found for the assertion that sindhura,' an elephant, becomes sindûra. We have only obtained sindurl, with the unspirated & but retaining the short l, as corruption of that word, and sindhûra, with the long û but retaining the aspirated dh, as another form of it. 
Bat, also, we have not found any conclusive authority for sendura or sendúra as a corruption of sindúra, 'red load. We have only obtained, more or less certainly sendura with the short 2k, and doubtfully sêndlära with the aspirated dh, and sendúra apparently deduced by inference from it. Turning, however, to other sources of information, we there obtain something quite definito. In a language closely allied to Kanarese, Mr. C. P. Brown's Telugu English Dictionary (1852) does not give sindura, sendura, sendúra, or sendúrok It does give simdhuramu, with the meaning of only an elephant,' and sindúramu, with the meanings of only red lead, minium,' and 'a sort of tree.' And, while it does mention simdhüramu with the aspirated dh and the long , it specifies it as an "error” for simdúramu. But, in a language of which the voca bulary is very much. mixed up with that of the Kanarese of the southern districts of the Bombay Presidency, Molesworth and Candy's Marathi-English Dictionary (1857), while not presenting sindhura, 'an elephant,' or sindura, does give simdûray with the meaning of only red lead, minium,' and gives sêmdûra (with the palatal $) ag a popular form of it, and also som dûra (with the dental s) with the indication that it is commonly written sendúra. And Professor Pischel, in $ 119 of his Prâkrit Grammar (1900), Vol. I., Part 8, of the Grundriss der Indo-arischen Philologie und Altertumskunde, has given sondûra, with the short e and the long û, as the corruption of sindura. On the other hand, the Páiyalachchhindmamála of Dhanapala, according to Dr. Bühler's edition (1879), does not seem to deal with sindúra, but indicates, in Verge 9, that sindhura, 'an elephant,' retains the tatsama-form simdhura, and does not present any oorraption of that word. 
It would thus seem that, among the Kanarese authorities, there has been some confusion between sindhura, ' an elephant,' and sendûra, 'red lead, minium, vermilion, which confusion, however, is in all probability confined to mistakes by copyists. But I cannot discover any authority of any kind for the assertion that sindhara, 'an elephant;' takes the form sindara, or any indication that the word sindura has the meaning of an elephant.' And there are no reasonable grounds for inputing any confusion between the two words to the writers of the ancient records. On the other hand, sendûra, aendûra, and sondūra are given as corruptions of sindůra by authorities of an auquestionable kind. We may, therefore, safely discard any idea that sindūralañchhana and sendûralañchhana can mean ' an elephant crest.' And we may safely revert to my original rendering of it as the mark of vermilion, for which, how ever, there is now to be substituted, in more technical terms, the red-lead crest. 
The only point that remains, is, to determine exactly what we are to understand by a rod-lead crest, Now, Monier-Williams' Sanskřit Dictionary, revised edition, gives sindtra tilaka es meaning "a mark on the forehead made with red lead.' And, similarly, Dr. Kittel's

? Also, we may remark, it gives sindura-tilaka as meaning marked with red lead, an elephant,' and sindúra. tilakd es denoting woman whose forehead is marked with red Icad (and therefore whose husband is living)," And E. H. Wilson has mentioned a particular une of the sinddra-tilaka by women, in telling us that a widow, about to commit suttee, " in making preparations for ascending the funeral pile, used to mark her forehead with sind dra, and to deck herself sumptuously with all the symbols of a sadhavd," or woman whose husband is still alive; see his works, VOL.

Kannada-English Dictionary gives sindúra-boțţu as meaning a round mark on the forehead) made with red lead.' That, therefore, was one of the uses of red-lead; namely, for making the tilaku or mark on the forehead, made with coloured earths, sandal-wood, or ungueuta, either as an ornament or as a sectariau distinction.' But a special use of the sindûra as a royal prerogative is established by the Rájatara ngint, 8, 2010. We are there told, in respect of a certain confidential official named Kôshthasyara, a councillor of king Jayasinha of Kashmir, that,- baddhy-ådhikariņaḥ śulkam grihñatrakâri râja-vat têna sya-nâmná bhâņdêshu drange sind ůra-mudrañar,- imprisoning the officials, he collected the customs at the watch-station, and had his own name stamped in red-lead on the vares as if he were the king." To this, Dr. Stein has attached the comment that "it is still customary in Jammu territory, and "probably elsewhere too in India, to mark goods for which octroi-duty has been paid, with "seal-impressions in red-lead (sindúra)." That comment is apposite enough. But we further learn from the text that, in ancient times, there was a certain royal privilege of stamping with red-lead. The word nudrana means the act of making the mudru or stamp or impression of the luñchhana or device on a seal or crest. And we thus see that the possession of the sindûralañchbana or sendûralañchhana entitled an owner of it to stamp his name, crest, or other symbol, in red-lead.

Govinda II., and the Alås plates which purport to have been issued in A.D. 770. 
In Vol. VI. above, p. 170 ff., I examined again, in the light of only the most nearly syn chronous records, a question which had engaged my attention once before. And I arrived at the same conclusion ; namely, that the successor of Krishna I. was his younger son Dhruva. I indicated that the pointed expression used in the Wani record of A.D. 807 (and repeated in the Rådhanpur record of A.D. 808), that Dhruva obtained the sovereignty by " leaping over his elder brother jy&shth-ollanghana)," would not be incompatible with the possibility that Govinda II., the elder son, was the intended successor of Kțishna I., and in fact is rather suggestive that, not only was that the case, but also an appointment of him as Yuvarája was actually made. And I found, in the Paithan record of A.D. 794, a possible intimation that Gôvinda II. established himself in the northern parts of the Rashtrakûţa territories, while Dhruva set himself up as his rival in the south, and that time elapsed before Dhruva made himself master of the whole kingdom. But I found it to be plain that, at the best, Gôyinda II. made a stand for only a short time. And I arrived at the conclusion, from the early authoritative records, that Dhruva set himself up as king immediately on the death of Krishna I., and that Govinda II. had no real part in the succession at all. 
Since then, there has been published, in Vol. VI. above, p. 208 ff., the record contained in the Alàs plates. This record mentions Dantidurga, son of Indra II., by a name, Dadriyaman, which is of course nothing but a mistake, made by the writer, for Dantivarman. It introduces Govinda II, 28 " the dear son" of the favourite of Fortane and the Earth, the Mahardjadhérája, Paramešvara, and Bhattáraka Akálavarsha-(Krishna I.), and describes him as the Yuvaraja Govindaraja, with the birudas or secondary appellations of Prabhûtaparsha and Vikramávalóka, "whose head was purified by an anointment to the position of Yuvarâja which was greeted with acolamation by the whole world, and who had attained the pañchamahasabda." It brings forward a certain Vijayaditya, with the býrudas of Mârâvalôka (sic) and Ratnayaraha, who is described as a son of another) Dantivarman, and as a son's son of a Dhruvarâja (who seems to be Dhruva, the younger brother of Govinda II.). And it recites that, at the request of Vijayaditya, and on a specified day of the month Âshådha' in the Saumya samvatsara, Saka Sariyat 692 (expired), falling in June, A.D, 770, Gôvinda II., as Yuvardja, being

then at the confluence of the rivers Krishnaverņa and Ilusi after his victorious camp had invaded the province of Vengi and the lord of Vengi had humbly ceded his treasures, his forces, and his country, granted to a Brahman a certain village in the Alaktakâ vishnya, which was a teritory close on the east of Kolhapur, between the rivers Vårnå, Krishņâ, and Dadhgaöga. 
Now, the bad formation of the characters, and the occasional very marked irregularity of the lines of the writing, suffice to shew that these Alâs plates do not contain the original and synchronous official record of the matters recited in them. And they are, therefore, a spurious record. Whether, however, the matter set forth in the record is unauthentic, is another question. But it seems hardly likely that the composer of it could have invented the birudas ending in avalóka. There is nothing discordant in the date, A D. 770, which applies, of course, to Krishna I. as well as to Gôyinda II., and fits in perfectly well between the dates of A.D. 754, which we have for Dantidurga-Dantiyarman II., and A.D. 783-84, which we have for Dhruva. And I think that, pending the production of any distinct evidence to the contrary, we may look upon this record as based upon something genuine, and as being a more or less accurate reproduction, from probably a manuscript copy, of an original record which had been lost, and may accept it as establishing, provisionally, that Govinda II. was actually installed as Yuvaråja, and was holding office as such, under his father Krishna I., in A.D. 770. While, however, it may be provisionally accepted to that extent, this Alâs record does not prove that 
Govinda II. succeeded to the throne and reigned as king." 
I See Ind. Ant. Vol. XXIX. p. 277 f. . On the subject of the avaid ka-appellations of the Rashtrakațas of Mâlkuèą, see Vol. VI. above, p. 188 f. 3 See Vol. V I. above, pp. 167, 197. 
• There is nothing more that can be said abont that question, to any practical purpose, until we obtain further definite facts to go upon. But I am compelled to notice some remarks made by Mr. D. R. Bhandarkar, on page 28 above, in connection with the Sânglt record of A.D. 933 and an alleged utilisation of it by me, in respect of the point in question, on the occasion indicated above, namely, in Vol. VI. above, p. 170 ff., when, he has said, I was meeting objections brought by him against the views previously expressed by me. So far from basing any argu inent on the Säugli record, so completely did I set it aside as being a late record of no authority on tho point in question, that it was only after twice reading through my remarks that I discovered that Mr. Bhandarkar's allusion 
• is to my inclueion of it in a foot-note in which I merely put together all the cases in which Govinda II. is, or is not, mentioned in the Rashtrakata records. And, go far from rightly understanding and applying the meaning of what I wrote, Mr. Bhandarkar ļas simply himself made from the SAogli record an objectless deduction, about Jagattunga. Gövinda III. and Amoghavarshı I., which could not serve any practical purpose, and in respect of which there is not any basis for his suggestion that it follows from anything said by me.- To the cases, put together by me in Vol. VI. above, p. 172, note 2, in which Govinda II. is, or is not, mentioned in the Rashtrakåta records, we have now to add two more. The Chokkhakuți grant of A.D. 867 (Vol. VI. above, p. 299, verses 15, 16, text lines 17 to 20) repeats the two veraes about Gayinda II. and Dhruve which are presented in the Paithan record of A.D. 794 And the Cambry plates of A.D. 930 (page 317 above, verges 8, 9, 11), text lines 10 to 14) present the three vers es about Krishna I., Govinda II., and Nirupama-(Dbruva) which we have in the Sangli plates of A.D. 988.

APPENDIX. 
A LIST OF 
INSORIPTIONS OF SOUTHERN INDIA 
FROM ABOUT A.D. 500. 
Br PROFESSOR F. KIELHORY, C.L.E. ; GÖTTINGEN, TN continuation of my List of the Inscriptions of Nortlıorn India. I now publish 2 similar list L of inscriptions of Southern India, which also was originally compiled solely for my TU ase. It contains all southern inscriptions from about A.D. 500 which I have found in the Tall ous publications accessible to me, excopting, ap a rule, those in Dr. Burgess and Pandit Natera Sastri's Archæol. Survey of Southern India, Vol. IV., and in 1[r, Rico's Epigraphia Carnatiche, Vol. III. ff. The inscriptions of any importance, other than rcprints, in the former publicatinu. may be expected to be soon republished critically, and those in the Epigraphia Carnatioa will, I have no doubt, receive a general index of their owu, when all thc texts liave been published. 
While I am writing these lines, my list contains 1,020 numbers which treat of about 1,200 separate inscriptions. Of this total about 210 are on copper-platos, and 890 on stonc. Taken 05 a whole, the inscriptions of the South in some respecte differ essentially from tho nortlicin inscriptiona. The latter with insignificant exceptions are all in Sanskrit; of tho 1,100 inscriptions in the present list not more than about 290 are in Sanskrit only3 About 3-40 are in Tamil, 320 in Kanarese, 10 in Telugu, 90 in Sanskrit and Kouarese, 30 in Sanskrit and Teluga, and 20 in Sanskrit and Tamil; the language of four is an ancient Prakrit, and a few are composod or con tain remarks in a dialect which apparently is an old form of Marathi, On tho othor hand, while the inscriptions of the North are dated in about tou differont crap the chief of which is the Vikrama era, Southern India generally uses the Saka era. Of about 510 of those inscriptions clated according to eras, * 450 quote the Saka and 20 from the southornmost part of India the Kolamha (or Kollan) era; six quite exceptionally use the era of the Kaliyuga (marked Ky.), and 34 are dated according to the Chålukya-Vikrama era (marked Châ. Vi.), i.e., rcally, in regnel yonzs of the Western Chalukya Vikramaditya VI. The Vikrama ora is foreign to the Sonth; it is quoted only once, in the most modern inscription of this list (of A.D. 1880), which also gives the number of years elapsed since Vardhamåna's Nirvana. This listi, moreover, will show tai in large tracts of Sonthern India it was the custom -- more rarely observed in Northom India to date documente only in the regnal years of the reigning kings. Of the prominent part which the Jovian years play in the dates of southern inscriptions I have had occasion to sponk elsewhere. 
Differently from the course followed in the Northern List, I havo arranged tho inscriptions here given mainly according to the dynasties to which they belong. Dated and undated rieccl laneone inscriptions which I cannot assign to any particular dynasty will bo gívoll under separato headings at the end of the list. Any inconvenience which may arrangement may cause I hupe to 
See above, Vol. V. Appendix. 
* ang inscriptions that may be published while this list is being printed will as far as possible be inserted 177 their proper places. 
"When the language of an inacription is not stated in this list, it should be understood to be Sanskrit. 
Current years will be denoted in this list by an asterisk placed after the qumerals for the year.EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. 
(VOL. VII. 
lessen by an index which will give all dated inscriptions arranged in the order of the Saka years. Another index is to contain most of the proper names which occar in this list. 
While doing this work, I often have found cause to regret that I kdOW so little of the vernaculars of Southern India, and I fear that this list must suffer through this want of mnowledge on my part. I nevertheless venture to hope that what I offer now will at least gave some trouble to others who are interested in Indian Epigraphy.
