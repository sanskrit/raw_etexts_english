We had earlier described our exploration of the spirograph,
hypocycloids, epicycloids and related curves. In course of our study of
the śaiva tantra-s of the kaula tradition we started thinking about a
remarkable piece of imagery mentioned in them. Tantra-s like the
Virūpākṣa-pañcākśika and Nityāṣoḍaṣikārṇava talk of the waves and
spinning cakra-s of Śakti-s. The Virūpākṣa-pañcākśika describes these
innumerable Śakti-waves and wheels of Śakti-s as emanating the universe:

svāñge cid-gagana+ātmani dugdhodadhi-nibhaḥ sva-śakti-laharīṇām |  
sambheda-vibhedābhyāṃ sṛjati dhvaṃsayati cai(e)ṣa jagat || 2.13

In his (Śiva’s) own body, in the void of the conscious-self, resembling
the milk-ocean, through the constructive and destructive interference of
the waves of his own śakti-s this universe is generated and destroyed.

rūpādi-pañca-viṣayātmani bhogya-hṛṣīka-bhoktṛ-rūpe ‘asmin |  
jagati prasarad ananta-sva-śakti-cakrā citirbhāvyā ||2.14

In the contents of the five sense-streams starting with form, in the
objects being sensed, in the sense organs and the first-person
experiencer, in the world generated by the innumerable wheels of his
Śakti-s consciousness should be conceived.

The Nityāṣoḍaṣikārṇava states:  
procchalan-mada-kallola-pracalaj-jaghanasthalām |  
śakti-cakrocchala-cchaktivalanā-kavalīkṛtām | 2.24-25

The goddess Tripurā is worshipped as: The gushing intoxicant waves
setting in vibration the vulval receptacle, setting in motion the śakti
wheels, spinning the Śakti wheels and devouring all.

This account of the waves of Śakti-s and their wheels led us to conceive
the imagery as related to the more general epicycloid problem: Imagine a
point on the circumference of a wheel rotating at some speed either
clockwise or anticlockwise. That point is the center of another wheel,
which is likewise rotating at a distinct speed. On the circumference of
the second wheel is a point which in turn is the center of yet another
wheel rotating at yet another speed and so on. Now what curve would a
point on the rim of the terminal wheel of this system would trace out?

More than 20 years ago mathematician Frank Farris, who has a great eye
for symmetry and beauty, showed that this can be described rather simply
by a function in the complex plane thus:  
![z(t)=a\_1e^{k\_1it}+a\_2e^{k\_2it}...+a\_ne^{k\_nit} ; \\; z(t) \\in
\\mathbb{C}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%28t%29%3Da_1e%5E%7Bk_1it%7D%2Ba_2e%5E%7Bk_2it%7D...%2Ba_ne%5E%7Bk_nit%7D+%3B+%5C%3B+z%28t%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z(t)=a_1e^{k_1it}+a_2e^{k_2it}...+a_ne^{k_nit} ; \\; z(t) \\in \\mathbb{C}")  
![a\_j=a\_1,a\_2...a\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_j%3Da_1%2Ca_2...a_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_j=a_1,a_2...a_n") represent the relative radii and ![k\_j=k\_1,
k\_2...k\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_j%3Dk_1%2C+k_2...k_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k_j=k_1, k_2...k_n") represent the relative speeds of rotation of the
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
wheels in the system. If the wheel is rotating clockwise then
![k\_j\<0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_j%3C0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k_j\<0") and ![a\_j=i\\cdot
a\_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_j%3Di%5Ccdot+a_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_j=i\\cdot a_j"); where
![i=\\sqrt{-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3D%5Csqrt%7B-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"i=\\sqrt{-1}")

1: The curve generated by a system of 9 wheels of relative radii:
1.0000000, 0.6180340, 0.3197333, 0.1227690, 0.2256262, 0.2233212,
0.4724658 and rotation speeds: -1, 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35.

Thus more generally we can define a complex function which would
generate “trigonometric tangles” related to those generated by a n-wheel
system:  
![z(t)=\\displaystyle \\sum
\_{j=1}^{n}a\_je^{k\_jit}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%28t%29%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum+_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7Da_je%5E%7Bk_jit%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"z(t)=\\displaystyle \\sum _{j=1}^{n}a_je^{k_jit}")  
where
![k\_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k_j") is real number and
![a\_j](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_j&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a_j") might be real or imaginary. Now these functions are symmetric and
closed as
![t](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "t")
takes all values
![\[0,2\\pi\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C2%5Cpi%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"[0,2\\pi]") when the following conditions are satisfied:  
![k\_j=l\\times n+m; \\; l \\in \\mathbb{Z}; \\; n,m \\in
\\mathbb{N}\_1\\; and \\;
\\textrm{gcd}(n,m)=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_j%3Dl%5Ctimes+n%2Bm%3B+%5C%3B+l+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%3B+%5C%3B+n%2Cm+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D_1%5C%3B+and+%5C%3B+%5Ctextrm%7Bgcd%7D%28n%2Cm%29%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k_j=l\\times n+m; \\; l \\in \\mathbb{Z}; \\; n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}_1\\; and \\; \\textrm{gcd}(n,m)=1")  
i.e if ![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l") is any integer and
![n,m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2Cm&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n,m") are relatively prime, positive integers then the resultant curve
is closed and has n-fold symmetry. Thus, keeping to symmetric closed
curves this equation can literally produce nava-nava-chamatkAra.
