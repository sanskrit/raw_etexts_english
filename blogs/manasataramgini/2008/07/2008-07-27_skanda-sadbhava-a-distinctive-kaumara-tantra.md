title = "skanda sadbhAva: A distinctive kaumAra tantra?"

+++
Even though there are kumAra shrines ranking amongst the richest of the
Indian temples, kaumAra worship can be generally characterized as being
in the decline, especially in terms of the ancient forms. In South India
the majority of priests at kaumAra shrines are actually saiddhAntika’s
who have taken over the worship of kumAra within the saiddhAntika
system. We have earlier touched upon this phenomenon and shown how the
saiddhAntika mantra-s have been inserted and overlaid upon some basic
kaumara mantra-s. Another smaller but still notable fraction of the
kaumAra officiants in South Indian temples are mAdhva-s, who are
vaiShNava-s in their personal practice. It is likely that they were
originally kaumAra-s and were converted to the mAdhva-mata, but retained
their role as kaumAra officiants. They are organized under some major
subrahmaNya maTha-s and are very secretive about their rituals. However,
direct observation suggests that their temple rituals are similar to
what mAdhva-s perform with respect to the viShNu temples in their
control. This raises the question as to whether in the kaumAra temple
system there are any remnants of worship prior to the saiddhAntika and
much later mAdhva influence.

The one text that we have found to throw some light on precisely in this
regard is the obscure tantra named skanda-sadbhAva (saMgraha). To our
knowledge the text has never been published and may currently only
influence a minority of kaumAra shrines in the drAviDa and andhra
countries. It does appear to be one of those major kaumAra tantra-s
whose core shows minimal saiddhAntika or any other later form of
influence. The text, as I have examined, has 18 chapters, and internally
states that it is an abbreviation of the larger skanda-sadbhAva:  
The frame of the Tantric narrative is set in kailAsa, where nandin asks
maheshvara about the rare and pristine shAstra named skanda sadbhAva. In
reply mahAdeva says:

shR^iNu loka hitArthaM me tantram etad asheShataH |  
shlokair dvAdasha sAhasrair munInAM kathitaM purA ||  
saMskShepAt tava vakShyAmi skanda-sadbhAvaM uttamam |  
adhyAya-aShTa dashopetaM skanda-sadbhAva saMyutaM || 1.3-1.4 (the
manuscript from which I entered this has no numbers of shloka-s; *a very
likely emendation of the unmetrical elements in above has been kindly
suggested by the learned scholar Somadeva Vasudeva:  
śṛṇu lokahitārthaṃ me & tantram etad aśeṣataḥ /  
ślokair dvādaśasāhasrair & munīnāṃ kathitaṃ purā //  
saṃkṣepāt tu pravakṣyāmi & skandasadbhāvam uttamam /  
adhyāyāṣṭādaśopetaṃ skandasadbhāvasaṃyutam //* )

Here, shiva in response to nandin’s query states that in the interest of
the world he would narrate the tantra in totality. He mentions that
earlier it was narrated to the muni-s in a form with 12000 shloka-s (a
typical Tantric number for the older longer texts), but he is narrating
it now in an abbreviated form, the skanda-sadbhAva (SS) in 18 chapters.

Then the text goes on to given an index of the 18 chapters: 1) saMgraha;
2) saMbhava; 3) mantroddhAra; 4) archana; 5) agnikArya; 6) dIkSha; 7)
samayAchara; 8) prAsAda vidhi; 9) adhivAsa vidhi; 10) sthApana; 11)
pratimA-lakShaNaM; 12) snapana vidhi; 13) utsava vidhi; 14) bali-karma;
15) prAyashchitta; 16) yAtrA; 17) pravesha; 18) samudAya.  
From this it is clear that it follows the common place pattern of
sthApana tantra-s seen in the saiddhAntika, vaikhAnasa and pA\~ncharAtra
realm. While such sthApana tantra-s are quite stereotypic in subject
matter, it is precisely in the realm of sthApana that saiddhAntika
influence has been dominant on the kaumAra system. Hence, the
skanda-sadbhAva helps us to glean the elements of the kaumAra sthApana
system outside of the saiddhAntika sphere.

The second chapter of the skanda-sadbhAva called saMbhava is of some
interest in establishing its affinities and origins. It is a condensed
purANa-like narrative, giving the kumAra-saMbhavaM, which follows the
same general frame seen in several Sanskrit purANa-s and the itihAsa-s.
Here, kumAra is said to be born in the himAlaya-s (gaurI-giri) from the
tejas (euphemistically for retas) of shiva swallowed by agni and then
cast into ga\~NgA by him, and then by her into the shara-vana. Here he
develops into 6 children who are then suckled by the kR^ittkA-s. Then he
has the encounter with indra who is alarmed by this new being. This
potentially disastrous encounter is stopped by brahmA and agni and
finally skanda is taken by agni to rudra. Then he goes to war against
tAraka, the great enemy of the gods and kills him in a fierce encounter
with his shakti. While the narrative is common place, there are few
points to note: 1) It entirely follows the popular account given in
Sanskrit tradition and not the Tamil tradition. In the Tamil tradition
the main enemy of the deva-s killed by kArttikeya is shUrapadma, with
tAraka merely being an assistant of his. Amidst the saiddhAntika-s of
the dramiDa country who took over the kaumAra system this Tamil
tradition is widely adopted, even in their entirely Sanskrit liturgy.
For example, forms of the shatru-saMhAra-trishati or the subrahmaNya
bhuj\~Nga prayAta stotra, which they use, refer to the killing of
shUrapadma. This silence regarding the slaying of shUrapadma might place
the SS in the realm of the classical Sanskrit paurAnic tradition. 2) The
incident of the encounter with indra: indra seeing him blazing like the
fire mercilessly strikes skanda with his vajra. Then he becomes two
boys; upon the second strike he becomes 4 boys and upon the 3rd strike
he becomes 6 boys. The six of them resembling lighting then wage war on
indra. shAkha, vishAkha and nejamesha are not mentioned by name and this
peculiar series of fission into 2-4-6 is unique to this narrative.

The 3rd chapter gives the kumAra mantroddhAra (shiva begins by stating:
athaH paraM pravakShyAmi mantrodhAra vidhi kramaM). The manuscript I
have examined has some lacunae destroying a few words in this section.
Yet, it is complete enough to state that the entire mantroddhAra does
not have any saiddhAntika overlay, such as incorporation of the shaiva
pa\~nchAkSharI or the pa\~ncha-brahma mantra. The main mUla mantra it
teaches is the celebrated skanda ShaDakSharI mantra that it extracts
using the drawing of the mAtR^ika chakra (Shown below). Before the
mantra the praNava is said to be appended. The mantra is the same as the
one provided by the shAradA tilaka tantra (also known to
chennas-nArAyaNa nambuthiri-pAD):

athaH paraM pravakShyAmi mantrANAM prasaraM punaH |  
saptamasya chaturthaM tu tR^itIyAdyam athaH paraM ||  
pa\~nchame prathamaM bhUyaH kevalaM svara-varjitaM|  
punaH ShaShThe chaturthamsyAt pa\~nchama svara-saMyutaM ||  
chaturthaM saptame bhUyaH svareNaikAdashena tu |  
pa\~nchamAntaM punar dadyAt ShaShTAntam sa-visargakaM ||  
ayaM ShaDakSharo mantraH sAkShAt skandaH sanAtanaH | (SS 3.7-10ab)

Hence (applying sandhi): ||OM vachadbhuve namaH || the skanda
ShaDakSharI

\[Disclaimer: Though typically a 50 mAtR^ikA is used, I am simply
illustrating the 51 mAtR^ikA form I have inherited in my tradition,
because I use it for a number of purposes. The SS merely states
akAradi-kShakArAntAM\]

maheshvara then specifies the bIja-s of the mUrti mantra-s and says that
they must be conjoined with their respective names. The names are not
provided here, but are found in the 4th chapter on archana. Using them
we can reconstruct these mantra-s as well as the directions in which
these mUrti-s are placed in the petals of the kumAra maNDala:  
saM sanatkumArAya namaH || (E)  
skaM skandAya namaH || (S)  
baM bANAya namaH || (W)  
haM hemachUDAya namaH || (N)  
bhaM bhadrasenAya namaH || (NE)  
bhaM bhavaputrAya namaH || (SE)  
daM devasenAyai namaH || (SW)  
daM devayAnyai namaH || (NW)

Then shiva also goes on to give the following auxiliary mantra-s:  
vAhana: maM mayUrAya namaH ||  
dhvaja: kaM kukkuTAya namaH ||  
dhUrtasena (a major kumAra gaNa in this system): dhaM dhUrtasenAya namaH
||  
vighnesha (the receiver of the nirmAlya in this system): gUM gaNapatye
namaH ||  
Then shiva provides the uddhara of the second ShaDakSharI mantra –
manuscript is somewhat lacunose here but one can easily read the
essentials of he uddhara to extract the mantra:  
OM namaH ShaNmukhAya ||  
It also gives a distinctive kumAra gAyatrI of the form: OM shaktihastAya
vidmahe ShaDAnanAya dhimahi | tan-naH skandaH prachodayat ||

The 8th chapter on kumAra temples states that they may be constructed in
many places but specifically mentions the kadamba forest to be
associated with a guhAlaya. This connection to the kadamba tree is an
ancient one which even mentioned the mahAbhArata skandopAkhyAna of the
AraNyaparvan. The following emblems of kumAra which are made of gold:
mayUra (installed in the East); shakti (South); kukkuTa (West); vajra
(installed in the N); elephant (middle). The loka-pAla-s are installed
around the temple in the respective direction and two dvAra-palas at the
door posts with fierce appearance, good dress and holding shakti-s and
vajra-s. A distinctive feature of this tantra is the installation of
vedic R^ishi-s in maNTapa-s at different spots of specified by the
squares of the 64-squared vAstu-maNDala of the kumAra temple: a\~ngirasa
(bR^iSha), bhR^igu (vitatha), vasiShTha (bhR^i\~Nga), atri (sugrIva),
nArada (varuNa), gotama (shoShaNa, emended in original from shoSha),
bharadvAja (mukhya), agastya (soma) and vishvAmitra (jayanta).
Additionally smaller shrines are built for vighna (nirR^iti) and
shiva-bhutAdhipati (roga), a fire-ritual altar (agni) and a store room
for flowers (IshAna). A vajra is installed in the gopura facing the
gates, a peacockis placed in front of the deity and beyond it is placed
the balipITha. There after a copper-crested cock is placed atop a tall
dhvaja-stambha.
