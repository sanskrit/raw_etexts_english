Among extant sAdhaka-s it is popular to merely concentrate on
tattvArohaNa to reach parA devI. This apparently follows the tradition
of sahajAnandanAtha and is transmitted by certain successors of the
Maharashtrian tAntrIka umAnandanAtha. But the complete form of the
sAdhana does require complete construct of trika with the three devI-s
and the bhairava-s. The middle prong of the trIshula has parA devI with
bhairavasadbhAva of the form as in the saundaryalahari ( sharaj-jyotsnA
shubhrAM); the right prong has the exceedingly fierce aparA devI with
navAtman (equivalent to kubjikA of the paschimAmnAya of the kula
tradition); the left prong has the fierce parAparA with
ratishekhara-bhairava. The five-headed sadAshiva of the siddhAnta
tantra-s lies at the base of the prongs of the trishUla, just as
mattress of tripurA in shrIkula. hUhuka-bhairava encompasses the
pa\~ncha tanmAtra-s and their receptors feeding into consciousness. All
this is more completely laid out in the and trika tantra-s and expounded
by the Kashmirian greats, but in extant practice the more complete parA
sAdhana is only known to some sAdhaka-s succeeding shrInivAsa bhaTTa.
