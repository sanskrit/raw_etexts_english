## i: The Origins of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, their Śrauta Traditions, and Southward Migration 
We know that the style of wearing one’s hair was a matter of ritual importance to 
the Vedic Aryans, often signifying adherence to a specific orthodoxy-orthopraxy 
complex. The term kapardin/kapardī, itself thought to be non-Vedic,20 occurs in the 
Ṛgveda, with six attestations (s.v. Lubotsky [1997] I: 420) in its different forms and 
seems to have signified the braided or tufted hair on a male’s otherwise shaven head, and 
the Vasiṣṭhas are said at ṚV 7.33.1 to wear their kapardin on the right side of the scalp. 
The pūrvaśikhā mode may well signify one such way of wearing one’s kapardin (indeed, 
just as its counterpart in this study, the aparaśikhā, another). In its extant practice, it 
consists in massing up the hair on top of otherwise shaven head into a knotted heap 
(Illustration I). Its earliest attestation occurs, as Gerhard Ehlers notes, (Response to EJVS 
10.1),21 at TS 7,4,9,1 (ṣikhām anu pra vapante): "to shave (the hair) forward in order to 
have a pūrvaśikhā" (Ehlers’ translation). As Ehlers points out, in the Taittirīya context, 
the ritualists are performing the gavamāyana ritual, imitating the "session of the cows" 
and accordingly wear the pūrvaśikhā at the end of the year in order to look like them: 
“gavāṃ hi tarhy anurūpā bhavanti (JB 2, 374)”. In other words, by the time of the 
redaction of the Taittirīya śākhā of the Yajurveda, ca. 1000-900 BCE, we have a distinct 
group wearing their hair in the pūrvaśikhā mode. We will see that the Taittirīya 
comparison of the pūrvaśkhā with a physiognomic feature of an animal will reappear in 
an almost identical trope, later, in the Sangam poetry. 

Their śrauta traditions are made up from the following Veda śākhās22: 

- i. Ṛgveda: The Śākala Ṛgveda and its Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra (AŚS) 
make up the lion share of their Ṛgveda affiliation. However, in addition, 
the Kauṣītaki tradition (allied to the Śāṅkhāyana Śrauta Sūtra [ŚŚS]) of 
the Ṛgveda occurs among the Pūrvaśkhās, once, it is thought, with the 
Bāṣkala śākhā as its Ṛgveda text.23 The Bāṣkala śākhā is no longer extant 
even among the Nambudiri Brahmans, the Pūrvaśikhā group with still a 
very robust Kauṣītaki tradition. The Śākala śākhā is the universal Ṛgveda 
śākhā among the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, as it is the case amongst all 
Brahmans now globally. All the same, the Kauṣītaki tradition seems to 
have been ritually the most active of all axes among the Pūrvaśikhās (see 
below, and note 11). 
- ii. Yajurveda: Only the Taittirīya śākhā of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda School 
occurs among the Pūrvaśikhās, in three different sūtra traditions: 
  - a. the Baudhāyana (both Śrauta and Gṛhya); 
  - b. the Vādhūla (both Śrauta and Gṛhya); 
  - c. the Āgniveśya, almost identical with the Vādhūla tradition, but only in its Gṛhya form. 
- iii. Sāmaveda: Only the Jaiminīya śākhā of the Sāmaveda occurs among the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans. 

Of the above, the Kāuṣītaki Ṛgveda, the Vādhūla-Āgniveśya Yajurveda and the 
Jaiminīya Sāmaveda occur only among the Pūrvaśikhās, so as to constitute positive proof 
of identity in epigraphic records and fieldwork: that is, if a Brahman is recorded in the 
grāmadeya plates or encountered in fieldwork in peninsular India as belonging to one of 
these Veda śākhās, he can be identified as a Pūrvaśikhā Brahman. Likewise, we have 
two epigraphic terms with unique Pūrvaśikhā attestations, paviḻiya and ś/jāmbavya, first a 
phonological corruption of bahuvṛca, the Āśvalāyana tradition, and the second, 
designating a branch of the Kauṣītaki sūtra of the Ṛgveda.24 From Witzel (1989; 1995), 
we can localize these Veda śākhās and sūtras to a broad area in the Gangā-Yamunā doab, 
in the Pāñcāla country, extending to the east along the Gangā (the Vādhūla tradition of 
the Taittirīya Samhita) to the Kosala area (the Kauṣītaki-Baudhāyana alliance), with 
substantial south-south-west extensions in the Jaiminīya realm (Map I). I argue in on- 
going work that some sort of geographical contiguity of the different schools produced 
specific śrauta axes in situ listed below. 

A śrauta tradition, arguably the most authentic, has, as we know, survived among 
the Pūrvaśikhā group, among the Nambudiri Brahmans,25 with abundant epigraphic 
evidence of śrautism among the other branches of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans till the 11th 
century CE from epigraphy (see below). Again, as we know, a tri-Vedic axis is the core 
of a śrauta ritual, the coordinated orchestration of the ādhvaryam, hautram, and the 
audgātram praxises in the unfolding of the ritual. I list below the four theoretical tri- 
Vedic axes possible for the performance a Pūrvaśikhā Śrauta ritual: 

- i. Kauṣītaki Ṛgveda-Baudhāyana Yajurveda-Jaiminīya Sāmaveda 
- ii. Kauṣītaki Ṛgveda-Vādhūla Yajurveda-Jaiminīya Sāmaveda 
- iii. Āśvalāyana Ṛgveda-Baudhāyana Yajurveda-Jaminīya Sāmaveda 
- iv. Āśvalāyana Ṛgveda-Vādhūla Yajurveda-Jaiminīya Sāmaveda 

Of the four, the śrauta axis i seems to have been historically the most active,26 
with iii and iv following, respectively. The axis ii does not seem to occur in practice,27 
the original geographic regions of these traditions not having been, perhaps, contiguous. 
I must add that the Kauṣītaki tradition adds to the 16-priest complement of the 
śrauta ritual personnel an additional ritualist (BŚS 2.7), the Sadasya priest, in as much as 
Vyāsa, the traditional redactor of the Mahābhārata epic appears as part of the sadasya 
assembled in the Janamejayas’s Snake Sacrifice when the epic is formally sung to the 
world, by the Śauti. It is not clear if Vyāsa is designated formally as the Sadasya priest or 
merely as a member of the learned group assembled at the sadas, the ritual hall.28 It is 
possible that the Kauṣītaki tradition merely formalizes an existing tradition surrounding 
the installation of a learned member of the śrauta community as Sadasya.29 

Finally, if the Śārada text is the simplicior text, it would follow that it is traceable 
to the Kuru-Pāñcāla area: by general consensus, the epic took shape in the northern Kuru 
area, around Kurukṣetra, not far from the regions to which the Pūrvaśikhā Veda śākhās 
have been localized, generally the Ganga-Yamuna doab. It is possible that they had the 
text with them, or even that, they were part of the agency of its final redaction. 
We have some direct evidence supporting the second conjecture, that the original 
Pūrvaśikhā group may have had links to the redaction of the epic in its extant frame- 
narrative form. We know that in the immediate post-Vedic period, when the form of 
frame narratives begins to arise as a function of the emerging narrative perfect in the 
Vedic, it reaches, as Witzel shows (1987c: 395; passim),30 its most sophisticated 20 
development, in the Jaiminīyabrāhmaṇa, part of the signature Pūrvaśikhā Sāmaveda 
tradition, in the retelling of the legend of Cyāvana a ṛṣi of the Bhṛgu lineage. And as we 
know, the form reaches its culmination in the extant Mahābhārata, framed at the 
innermost frame by Vyāsa’s discourse to Sumantu, Jaimini, Vaiśaṃpāyana, Śuka and 
Paila and at the outermost frame by the Śauti Ucchaśravas’s discourse to Śaunaka and the 
other ṛṣis in the sadas, with Vyāsa himself present possibly in the ritualistic role of the 
Sadasya priest, an office only evidenced in the Pūrvaśikhā śrauta praxis. A link to the 
Jaiminīyas is further seen in the development of closely related Bhṛhaddevata: Tokunaga 
(1997: 186) cites the Sāmaveda Brāhmaṇas, Jaiminīya and its lost proto-text, the 
Ṣāṭyāyana as “[of] special importance” in the development of the story of Dadhyañc (Bd. 
16d-23), adding, (186, note 2): “A close relationship of our author [that of Bd] with the 
Sāmaveda is also attested by his frequent mention of the teachers and sources presumably 
associated with this school” (My parenthesis]. Parpola (1984: 463-64) adduces a similar 
link between the epic and the Jaiminīya tradition, noting that Jaimini was the udgātha 
priest of Janamejaya’s sarpa sattra and one of the five figures to whom Vyāsa committed 
the epic.31 We should note that this picture dove-tails with the main features of the 
Hiltebeitel-Witzel model of the textualizatin of the epic mentioned earlier: the Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans, still in the Vedic realm, would be part of Hiltebeitel’s “committee of 
Brahmans” who redact the epic into a Brahmanical work. Hiltebeitel (2001: 19) sees 
them as “out of sorts” Brahmans “who may have had some minor king’s or merchant’s 
patronage, but probably for personal reasons show a deep appreciation of, and indeed 
exalt, Brahmans who practice “the way of gleaning”: that is uñchavṛtti Brahmans reduced 
to poverty who live a married life and feed their guests and family by “gleaning” grain,” 
not unlike, as Hiltebeitel (27) notes, Patañjali’s śiṣṭha Brahmans.32 It goes without saying 
that such Brahmans would also be śrautins, functioning as the agents of the Vedic oral 
traditions, as what comes to be called in Manu the Śrotriya Brahmans.33 We must note 
that a serious threat does rise in the east, as I argue below, to these Vedic traditions 
formed in the west, in the Kuru-Pñcāla area, in the form of the Vājanseyi-centered 
Vedism, promoted by the Magadha imperialism, possibly rendering these western 
Brahmans “out of sorts”. Thus the reformist Brahmanical dynasties, who would seek to 
support śrauta traditions, would naturally form suitable patrons (Witzel 2006). I argue 
below, in Section D, that what comes to be schematized in I. Mahadevan (2003) as the 
Southern Brāhmī script, a *Southern Brāhmī script, served the textualization of the epic 
and traveled southward later with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans with their departure, evolving 
later into its different attested scripts in the peninsula, the Grantha being the one most 
relevant to this study. 

We cannot determine the exact dates of departure of the Pūrvaśikhā group from 
the antarvedi area, nor the motives behind the departure, but we can go farther than the 
vague wanderlust of the Brahman often noted in literature impelling migration—Agastya 
of the Ṛgveda himself seen in some fanciful historiography as the redoubtable Vedic 
counterpart of Friar Tuck of Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe, leading Brahman migration 
southward.34 On the other hand, the śrauta axes that I have listed above and their survival 
in a live oral tradition to our times make it probable that it was an organized departure.35 
Its live survival today among one of the branches of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans in a 
continuous and unbroken practice testifies to the continual Vedic svādhyāya institutions 
at work over time and space, suggesting a sizeable number of families moving in tandem, 
necessitating, as I argue in on-going work, a complete revision of our existing ideas about 
Brahman migrations. It is possible that the rise of the Śukla Yajurveda tradition as an 
imperial praxis under the Magadhan hegemony in the Kosala-Videha lands (5th-6th 
century BCE)36 may be a factor: it is useful to note here the well-attested and extreme 
dislike of the Māgadha Brahmans in Vedic texts as for instance the reference at 
Lāṭyāyana Śrauta Sūtra (8. 6. 28), “the despicable Brāhmaṇa-fellows native to Magadha” 
(Parpola 1968: 29; n.1).37 The rises of Buddhism and Jainism may also have played a 
role. 

There is little doubt that an external agency impelled the movement. We may rule 
out impulsive or eccentric migrants, although as with Bāvari of the Buddhist texts (see 
below) there were such cases. As I have indicated above, a live śrauta tradition has 
survived among the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans (as well as among the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, 
the second group in migration) showing that the start-up migrant population should have 
met, as I argue in greater detail elsewhere, two sustainability criteria: first biological and 
thus linked to the Gotra distributions of the start-up population; second, in terms of the 
Vedic praxis, thus linked to the Sūtra affiliations. That is, from the first criterion, we can 
deduce, and this is confirmed by both epigraphy and field work, that the start-up 
population had enough affiliates to the different Gotra labels to meet the twin criteria of a 
Brahmanical marriage: exogamy, ruling out a spouse of one’s own Gotra label; 
endogamy, allowing kinship only between Gotra affiliates. Both the Pūrvaśikhā and 
Aparaśikhā Brahmans meet this criterion. Both groups also meet the second 
sustainability criterion, that of the Sūtra distribution of the start-up population to maintain live Vedic praxises, especially in its srauta form. As we know, this requires the 
coordination of three individual Vedic praxises, those of the hautram, ādhvaryam and 
audgātram: sufficient human agency in terms of numbers must be presumed to be present 
in the original migrant population to have enabled the sustainability of the Vedic oral 
traditions. Thus in both cases of the Brahmans, and we have ample epigraphic evidence 
for the Aparaśikhā group, the migrant population was large and varied enough along the 
two sustainability criteria, suggesting that the migration itself was possibly well- 
coordinated and planned. 

We may rule out in this context the commonplace economic motive of migration 
in the case of Śrauta Brahman communities. A self sustaining Śrauta Brahman 
community is generally seen to be affluent in its traditional setting, the affluence arising 
entirely from patronage—indeed, the śrauta culture demanding it and royal patronage 
providing it, the brahma-kṣatra alliance of the Vedic age functioning at the ground level. 
This does not necessarily conflict with the idealized poverty of the uñchavṛtti institution, 
noted above, the affluence essentially funding the expenses of the annual śrauta rituals.38 
It is tempting to place the departure of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans before the 
formation of the Āpastaṃba Śrauta Sūtra tradition, ca. 300 BCE, as it is signally absent 
among them. However, we can possibly mark their southward movement on the 
dakṣiṇāpatha from Buddhist records—in keeping with the general pattern, noted by 
Witzel,39 that many details of early Brahman history are often evidenced in Buddhist 
records. The Pāli Canon text, the Suttanipāta,40 records the performance of a śrauta ritual 
on the dakṣinṇāpatha, calling it a mahāyaññam (l. 979), at Assaka on the Godāvarī: 
Bāvari, a wanderlust-type Brahman, arrives at Assaka in the neighborhood of Aḷaka, from 
Mithila, Kosala and after making himself welcome at the prosperous Brahman 
settlements and alms from them on the banks of the river for three years performs the 
mahāyajña with 16 priests (l. 1006: soḷasa brāhmaṇa) from among his hosts in the 
Assaka Brahman community—clearly a śrauta ritual, 16 priests being the complement of 
a śrauta ritual. We already know that Bāvari in his native Kosala is a product of the 
Vedic svādhyāya system, a master of mantras (l. 977 manta pāragū). A traditional 
brahmodya follows at the conclusion of the śrauta ritual and with it, the danger of 
possible explosions of heads. The 16 priests go north to the Buddha, traversing the 
dakṣiṇāpatha northward to learn, as per the Buddhalogical plotting of the account, the 
secret of keeping their heads from exploding and thus avoid, again, from the Buddhist 
point of view, the occupational hazard of the Śrauta Brahmans. 

The Suttanipāta text is part of the older layers of the Pāli Canon text, placed in the 
3rd century BCE.41 It is quite likely that this was a Pūrvaśikhā Śrauta ritual: the Assaka 
settlement would seem to be too far away from the śrauta traditions surrounding the 
Śukla Yajurveda, relatively recently formed, some three centuries or so ago, in the 
Kosala-Videha area. The newer Āpastaṃba-based ritualism of the second group of 
Brahmans of this study, ca. 300 BCE and centering around Mathurā on the Yamunā 
would be too recent also to have reached this far south and east by the time of the 
Suttanipāta text. And the total priestly complement, the 16 that went north and became, 
alas, Buddhists plus Bāvari, giving us 17 ritualists in all, resonates with the Kauṣītaki 
Śrautism. 

## B. ii. The Pūrvaśikhā Presence in the Sangam Tamil Country and the Creation of the Pūrvaśikhā Text. 
Their arrival and presence in the Tamil country during the Sangam period is, on 
the other hand, beyond dispute. Hart (1975: 149) estimates that about 10% of the 
Sangam poets were Brahmans, deeming it a low estimate as “not all Brahmins could have 
had telltale names.” It is difficult to imagine what the global numbers of the Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans were in the Sangam country for this period; there is little doubt as inferred 
from the two sustainability criteria above that it must have been substantial. The Vedic 
imprint on Sangam poetry is really quite vast, indicating a sizeable Brahman complement 
behind it. Moreover, Brahmans are equally attested in all three Sangam kingdoms, 
indicating an isotropic distribution along the three Sangam kingdoms. And the one Vedic 
item that reveals to us the Brahman presence in the Sangam period is the “experience- 
near” feature,42 the style of the wearing of the hair among the males of the group, namely 
the kuṭumi. The kuṭumi, the Sangam Tamil word for the hair tuft (from koṭi and koṭu 
[DEDR # 2049]43 first signifying “banner, flag, streamer” and the second, “summit of a 
hill, peak, a mountain”) is distinctly in the pūrvaśikhā mode, attested in poem after 
poem, amounting to a poetic trope44—or Ramanujan’s “poetic code” (1985: 282)--as in 
the two following examples: 

“And all those horses of our man of the tall hills 
have tufts of hair like the Brahman urchins of our town” 
(Aiṅkurunūṛu 202; A.K.Ramanujan’s [1985: 9] translation) 
“[T]he tuft on his head is like the mane of a horse” 
26 
(Puṛanānūṛu 310:11; George Hart’s [1999: 179] translation) 

The horse’s mane to which the kuṭumi is being compared above recalls the calf’s newly 
forming horns of the Taittirīya passage, noted earlier: the hair in both cases is massed up 
toward the front of the head. 

Because of its excellent DEDR derivation noted above as a “flag” or “streamer,” 
the kuṭumi as pūrvaśikhā may be taken to signify the indigenous mode of wearing hair in 
the Tamil country before the arrival of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans: if so, we have here a 
striking coincidence between the indigenous style and immigrant style, perhaps even 
accounting for the wide patronage and welcome the Brahmans are seen enjoying in the 
Tamil country in the Sangam period. Above, the pūrvaśikhā is specifically linked to a 
Brahman child in the Ainkuṛunūṛu verse, the language suggestive of total acculturation— 
an urchin running about the streets—of the Brahman group in the host region. The 
elegiac subject in the second example is a young warrior, fallen in battle, having “slain 
painted elephants” (l.5) and thus presumably not a Brahman, but presented in the same 
trope as the Brahman child, suggesting that the front tuft was universal in the Tamil 
country at this time and that the term as such signified only this mode in the Sangam 
period. It is also significant that a Tamil word comes to signify a Vedic item, suggesting 
an exuberant acculturation between the Sangam era Brahmans and the indigenous people 
of the Tamil country 

Could “kuṭumi” signify the aparaśikha mode as well?45 The aparaśikhā mode 
would signify a tuft of hair hanging down from the back of the head, like a pony tail. It 
would seem that either tōkai (DEDR 3532) or vāl (DEDR Appendix 17) is the more 
suitable word for comparison, to indicate an item hanging vertically down. The poet uses 
instead, kuṭumi, signifying the mane, a horizontal item on a galloping horse, thus more 
appropriate for the pūrvaśikhā mode. Etymologically, “kuṭumi” seems to signify the fore 
part of the head, as with the crown of peacock (Subrahmanian 1966: 285). The poet uses, 
moreover, the horse to suggest abandon and virility—especially in the case of the fallen 
hero. Thus it would seem that the poet had in mind a horse in gallop, an apt image of 
heroism of the fallen hero and the urchin running about wildly, with the top knot 
streaming, like the horse’s mane, from the fore part of the head. Finally, the word is sex- 
specific: it is never used to refer to a woman’s braids, hanging from the back of the head, 
not generically different from the aparaśikhā mode. Thus, it would seem this that the 
kuṭumi of the Sangam poetry is the fore-lock kind, wound and tied up at the top of the 
head, streaming out like a flag or banner or the mane of a horse when loose. 

The much noted Vedic details of Sangam poetry (Sastri: [1935] 1975: 93; 
Parpola: 1983)46 also accord with what we know of the Pūrvaśikhā śrauta tradition: the 
most notable śrauta ritual described Sangam poetry is the Agnicayana, in Puṛanānūṛu 224 
(ll. 6-9), still extant among the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās in a live praxis. It is true that the 
Agnicayana ritual occurs among the second group, the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, as well. 
However, the Agnicayana of the Sangam poetry is either the pāñcapatrikā (“five-tipped”) 
or the ṣaṭpatrikā (“six-tipped”) type, in which the altar is shaped after a bird (kite, at l.
above): the Agnicayana with the bird-shaped altar is the only type known among the 
Pūrvaśikhās, whereas it is only one of several types of altars known among the 
Aparaśikhās and nor is it the most popular one.47 Thus, in conjunction with the 
pūrvaśikhā kuṭumi attested in Sangam poetry, we can conclude that the Sangam-era 
Brahmans were Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans. 

The one Sattra-type ritual referred to in Sangam poetry is the Rājasūya, 
performed by a Cōḷa king, Vēṭṭa Perunāṛkiḷḷi, styled by the poet Pāṇṭaran Kaṇṇanār as 
Cōḻan Irācacūyam Vēṭṭa Perunārkiḷḷi at Puṛanānūṛu 16. The Pūrvaśikhā Vedism was 
developed fully enough to meet the performance of the Rājasūya ritual. We may assert 
this not just on ritual grounds; a considerable discursive literature exists among 
Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās on the Rājasūya literature, the most significant of which is 
Narayana Bhaṭṭatiri’s Rājasūyaprabandha (ca. 17th century; Kunjunni Raja Agni II: 309), 
an allegorical interpretation of the Agnicayana, in which the bricks that go into the 
making of the altar are related to the story of Kṛṣṇa (Staal 1983 [I]: 187). We have 
already seen how a 1612-verse insertion into the Sabhāparvan from the Harivaṃśa 
celebrates Kṛṣṇa as the worthy guest at Yudhiṣṭira’s Rājasūya in the SR Mahābhārata. 
The interest in Rājasūya persists to the modern times, in the writings of the foremost 
Nambudiri ritualist of our times, Ērkkara Raman Nambudiri.48 It should be added that 
the responsibility of ritually crowning the Cōḷa monarch lay with the Pūrvaśikhā Dīkṣitars 
of Chidambaram in historical times.49 

Altogether, four Brahmanical gotras occur in Sangam literature (kaunḍiniya- 
vasiṣṭha, kauśika-viśvāmitra, ātreya, and gautama-aṇgirasa)50 and they also occur 
regularly among the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, although this could not be thought to have 
probative value, as the same gotras occur among the Aparaśikhās as well. It is very 
likely, as my on-going study shows,51 that the distribution of gotra labels is globally 
isotropic for the Brahman group as a whole, having formed in the period right after the 
redaction of the Ṛgveda and but before the formation of the Yajurveda and Sāmaveda 
traditions. This is seen from the fact that the gotras of the adherents of all the three 
Vedas, the Vedas of the rituals, go back to the ca. 50 gotra-pravara lists of the 
Baudhāyana Śrauta Sūtra appendixes, and these 50 pravaras are linked in turn to the ṛṣi 
composers of the Ṛgveda as indexed in the Anukramaṇī lists. In other words, when the 
adherence to the Yajurveda or the Sāmaveda, as the case may be, arose as a family 
tradition based on birth and institutionalized subsequently by a svādhyāya system, the 
adhering family already possessed a gotra identity originally derived from a ṛṣi of the 
Ṛgvedic hymns. It is useful to note, on the other hand, that the gotra profile of the 
adherents of the Atharvaveda—a Veda with no function in the śrauta tradition--is entirely 
different.52 

A further link between the Sangam poetry and the Pūrvaśikhā group may be the 
polygamy referred to at Puṛanānūru 178, a full-dress description of an ideal Vedic 
Brahman of the lineage of the kauṇḍinya gotra. He is pictured with three wives. It is 
quite possible that polygamy existed among the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans; it was not 
uncommon among the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās even into the historical period,53 while it 
seems almost entirely unattested among the Aparaśikhā group. In the poem, the chief 
wife wears an ornamental head-piece called valai: however, I have not been able to trace 
it to either the Pūrvaśikhā or Aparaśikhhā Brahmans. 

Hart (1975: 33-34; 1999:22) based on the “war sacrifice” mentioned Puṛanānūṛu 
26 theorizes that the Sangam era Brahmans were “different” (1975:51) from their 
Northern counterparts, adding, however, a few lines later that they “retained much of 
their Northern outlook and way of life” (51). We do not know what exactly the “war 
sacrifice” entailed; the verse referring to the sacrifice reads (Hart 1999: 22): 30 
“As Brahmans of the Four Vedas, calm though the breadth of their knowledge, 
devoted to restraint, surrounded you and kings carried out your orders, you 
completed the sacrifice established by tradition.” (ll. 12-14) 

The Brahmans are shown to be present at the sacrifice, but it is not clear if they perform it 
or take part in it. It is also not clear if the ritual was Vedic, although it is referred to as 
kēḷvi, a term usually signifying Vedic ritual, the term itself thought to be a translation of 
the Sanskrit śruti (Hart 1999: 252). Could it be an indigenous ritual? As Harts notes, 
“the earliest Brahmans did the only thing that they could if they were to stay in Tamilnad: 
they associated themselves with the kings....Thus they had to participate in such 
unbrahminical activities as the war sacrifice and cutting the bodies of those who had died 
in bed” (1975: 55). In other words, there was acculturation between the Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans and the indigenous people, the temple-based Bhakti movements being the most 
striking result of this, and as we will see, the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans are concretely linked 
to both temples and Bhakti movement. All the same, a śrauta core, still extant, remains 
intact with the group. 

One other piece of evidence, albeit negative, favouring the view that the Sangam 
era Brahmans were all Pūrvaśikhās comes from epigraphy (see below). The first 
Brahman with the signature Aparaśikhā sūtra affiliation to the Āpastaṃba tradition 
appears in a Pallava brahmadeya Copper Plate only in the 5th century CE, and even then 
still in Upper South India, with the Pallava influence still far from descending into the 
Tamil country proper. As we will see below, the Āpastaṃba affiliates eventually 
constitute the principal segment of the Aparaśikhā population, upward of 70%, and we 
begin to see this dominance only by the 8th CE, with the 108-Brahman complement of the 
grāmadeya system. In other words, it is quite unlikely that they were present in the 
Tamil-Kerala country during the Sangam period and its immediate aftermath. 
Likewise, we can eliminate the Gurukkal Brahmans, indigenous to the Tamil 
country, but on different grounds. Their presence is attested in the Tamil country in 
epigraphy in the Tamil middle ages and may well date from the Sangam period and even 
earlier. In the modern period, they are chiefly temple priests, adhering to an Āgama 
praxis. However, their Vedic traditions are incomplete or improvised, thus ruling them 
out as the Brahmans of the Sangam poetry. They are an all-Baudhāyana group with just 
five gotra affiliations, confined to “Bharadvaja, Kaśyapa, Kauśikā, Gautama and Ātreya 
(or Agastya) (sic)” (Fuller 1984: 28), but the mastery of the Taittirīya Samhita through an 
oral tradition is not found amongst them. I argue elsewhere that they might be seen as 
acculturated into Brahmanism by Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans on the latter’s first arrival in the 
Tamil country. It is possible the Gurukkals were already temple priests in the Tamil 
country when the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans arrived there; it is their universal profession 
today (Fuller 1984). Several historical Pūrvaśikha groups of the Tamil country are also 
linked to temple priesthoods, the most famous being the Dīkṣitars of Chidambaram. 
However, we must note that when the two groups are priests together in temples in the 
Tamil country, as at Avaṭaiyār Koil in Tanjavur or Tiruvanakkavu in Tiruchirappaḷḷi, the 
Tamil Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhā priests follow strictly Vedic liturgies, whereas the Gurukkals 
follow the Āgama liturgies. 

Were there other groups of Brahmans with a Vedic tradition in the Sangam 
country that have escaped our notice here? We can answer this question broadly in the 
negative thanks to the gazetteer discourse of the late 19th century, the different volumes 
of “Castes and Tribes” of India: the gazetteers charted out, as in the case of the Thurston- 
Iyer inventory, all the Brhaman groups there were attested in the peninsular India in the 
late 19th century CE--all, then and now, still extant.54 It is seen that every Brahman group 
of the Gazettes can be plausibly accounted for in my stratigraphic scheme, the Pūrvaśikhā 
group in the Sangam period with its later different historical branches listed in Thurston 
and the Aparaśikhā group, with its many branches, likewise, listed in Thurston, arriving 
from the beginnings of the Pallava period. 

A preponderance of evidence thus suggests that the Brahmans of the Sangam 
poetry were Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans. We have already seen in Section A above that we 
have a Mahābhārata epic, almost certainly in its *Śarada form, present in the Tamil 
country at a “primitive” moment of the epic’s evolution, in the very beginnings of the 
first millennium of the CE. In other words, we see that the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans and the 
epic are present in the same area at the same time. Both Sanskrit epics are attested in 
Sangam poetry, with the Mahābhārata appearing in a Tamil translation, known in 
subsequent commentarial discourse as the Peruntēvanār-pāṭiya Pāratam—the Bhārata 
sung by Peruntēvanār. Five groups of verses said to be excerpted from this translation 
appear as invocations to gods--kaṭavul vāḻttu--in five collections of Sangam poetry, but 
they are clearly of later origins, with the verses themselves not linked to the 
Mahābhārata thematically or otherwise. However, these gods’ praises—two to Śiva; two 
to Viṣṇu, one to Murukan—are without the later sectarian tones, especially in the case of 
the first two sets and thus dating themselves earlier than the Bhakti poetry, starting ca. 7th 
century CE.55 

The link between the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans and the epic is further substantiated 
by what may be seen as the post history of the *Pūrvaśikhā text of my chart, resulting in 
the eventual Malayalam version in the Malabar area of modern Kerala and what I have 
designated as the Σ-SR text, remaining in the Tamil country. 
First, the Malayalam version of the SR text: as noted above, the Poona editors 
found this text to be shortest, the Śārada text of the SR tradition. Being almost the 
archetype, it must be closest to, if not identical with, the *Pūrvaśikhā text of stemma 
chart (6-7 above) above. All the manuscripts of the Malayalam version, as we will see in 
Section B.vi below, came to Poona from the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhā homes and centers of 
learning in the Malabar region of Kerala. It is legitimate to assume thus that *Pūrvaśikhā 
text and the Malayalam version must be one and the same, taken in my scheme to the 
Malabar country by the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās at or after the Kaḷabhra Interregnum, ca. 
5th-7th centuries CE, when the different historical identities of individual Pūrvaśikhā 
groups begin to emerge. In other words, in the pre-Kaḷabhra period, the Pūrvaśikhā 
group was one large intact group, no doubt with internal segmentations, but linked 
through common Veda śākhās and the pūrvaśikhā tuft. We have enough evidence to link 
the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās, historically attested today in Kerala—and so linked to that 
area as to appear autochthonous--to the Tamil country: We encounter, for instance, the 
uniquely Pūrvaśikhā epigraphic term, “paviḻiya” (or pakaḻiya) for the bahuvṛca- 
Āśvalāyana tradition, occurring in Taṇṭantoṭṭam Plates of the Pallavas, dated to 790 CE: 
four families (items 23 [kāśyapa gotra; Nimbēi Vaḍugaśarma-trivedi]; 97 [bhāradvāja 
gotra; Aṇappūr Bhavarudra-caturvedin; 128 [rathītara gotra; Mēṟṟamaṅgalam 
Uttarakaraṇika alias Ayyan Parameśvaran; 134 [gārga gotra; Vaṅgippāru Damodara 
Bhaṭṭa]; Mahalingam 1988: 289-313; see below) adhering to this sūtra are part of the 
brahmadeya deed, living in the Toṇṭaimaṇṭalam area of the Tamil country, in the southern 
parts of today’s Andhra Pradesh. Today, the term has survived only among the 
Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās, designating the Āśvalāyana tradition, placing the Nambudiri 
Pūrvaśikhās thus in north-eastern part of the Tamil country as late as the 8th century CE 
(see below for a fuller discussion of the Pallava epigraphy and significance of the 
occurrence of the term paviḻiya this far north and northeast). We know as well that a 
Vedic ritualist like Hastiśarman—of Kāśyapa gotra and Jaiminīya Sūtra--of Vasiṣṭhakuṭi, 
thus with the historical identity of a Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhā and from the southern parts of the 
Toṇṭaimaṇṭalam area in the Tamil country, could arrive at Kerala and become a 
“Nambūdiri” Pūrvaśikhā there in roughly the same period: the impediment of the 
language and the alienation from long separation having not yet arisen.56 All of this 
would also explain the ‘anomalous’ alignment between the Śārada text and the 
Malayalam version, the latter being almost identical to the *Pūrvaśikhā text, rising 
directly from the template of the Śārada text, but leaving the Tamil country proper with 
the historical Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās at the Kaḷabhra Interregnum. As I elaborate 
elsewhere, it is possible the Pūrvaśikhā group which moves to Malabar to become the 
historical Nambudiri Brahmans, were already concentrated in the Karur region of the 
Cēra kingdom during the Sangam period, facing the Palghat gaps and arriving in the 
Malabar country through those gaps at the Kaḷabhra Interregnum, their settlements 
literally ballooning into Malabar from the Tamil country (Map II).57 

It is even more significant that a *Pūrvaśikhā SR text remains in the Tamil 
country. This is my Σ-SR text, my choice of Greek letter hosting the ‘σ’ of Sukthankar’s 
σ-text, the two together giving rise to the Grantha-Telugu SR version in time. We must 
keep in mind that Sukthankar created the σ-text out of a theoretical need: he saw that all 
manuscripts from the peninsular region were familially Southern Recension texts, but the 
Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu texts showing greater exposure to the Northern Recension texts 
than the Malayalam versions. He hypothesized the σ-text, a Northern version, coming to 
the peninsular region, with, as we see now, the Aparaśikhā Brahmans. It is of interest as 
well that Sukthankar assumes a Southern Recension text to be resident in the Tamil 
country, although he does not designate it with a Greek letter, to host the σ-text, and 
transform it at the same time to the mould of the Southern Recension. In my chart above, 
this is the Σ-*Pūrvaśikhā text, remaining in the Tamil country with the rump Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans. 

It is possible to link, in fact, the Σ-SR text to one branch of the rump, the Śōḻiya 
Pūrvaśikhās, concentrated in the Cōḷa region thus acquiring the name. The evidence for 
this—more fully rehearsed below in Section B. v--comes from the role that the Śōḻiya 
Pūrvaśikhās are seen playing in the emergence of Śrīvaiṣnavism in the post Kaḷabhra 
period, ca. 7th CE. All four Brahman Āḻvārs are Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans by 
tradition, functioning thus, as we will see below, as a conduit for the Kṛṣnaism of the 
emerging Śrīvaiṣṇavism from the Mahābhārata. We know that the epic, especially the 
Harivaṃśa, is the sole source for the Kṛṣṇa material in the Āḻvār songs, not the Purāṇas, 
the earliest of the latter emerging in North India, ca. 200 CE when the Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans are already in the Sangam Tamil country (see below). We noted above the 
long Kṛṣṇaistic insertion from the Harivaṃśa into the Sabhāparvan, already done in the 
Sangam period, certainly before the Kaḷabhra Interregnum. It is quite likely that 
Kṛṣṇaism is incipient in the Tamil country even during the Sangam period: Ramanujan 
counts some 34 names among the Sangam poets with “kannan” in their names, the 
endearing diminutive for the god in Tamil.58 

## B. iii. The Kaḷabhra Interregnum and the Dispersal of the Pūrvaśikhā Group 
Although the precise details of this famous interlude in Tamil history are still 
shrouded in mystery, there is wide consensus of historical opinion that, first, it occurred; 
second, it was caused by the invasion of the Tamil country by the Kaḷabhras from the 
Karnataka in the west and northwest, and third, the invasion had a religious component to 
it in that the Kaḷabhras were Jains. No doubt, the Kaḷabhra’a anti-Brahmanism, as 
evidenced in the Vēḷvikkuṭi Plates, received exaggerated play in the early historiography 
of the subject, the famous “long night” interlude of Tamil history according to K.A.N. 
Sastri (1964:19),59 but as the plates, certainly the central document of the Kaḷabhra 
Interregnum, show, the dispossession of Brahmans did take place and some sort of 
restoration under the Pāṇṭiyan rule was in place by early 7th century CE, ca. 620 CE, in 
Kaṭuṇkōṇ’s reign.60 It is useful to remember that the anti-Jainism of the Bhakti poetry, 
especially that of Appar and, with greater virulence, in that of Tirujñānasaṃbandar post- 
dates the Kaḷabhra Interregnum,61 perhaps, as I argue in Section C below, is even caused 
by it. Neither the Tamil Brāhmī cave inscriptions nor their literary counterpart, the 
Sangam poetry, even with, as noted above, a significant Vedic and Brahmanical content, 
is hostile to the Jains or their religion: in fact, as we will see below, in Section C, the 
Tamil Brāhmī inscriptions show that the Jain religion played a role of paramount 
importance in the Tamil-Kerala country from 3rd century BCE to 6th century CE. 
In other words, there was an interregnum in Tamil history about this time, from 
5th to 7th centuries CE, with a before-and-after scenario: Sangam poetry with its heroic 
ethos before and the Bhakti poetry with its devotional ethos after. No doubt, there were 
many cross-over features from Sangam poetry to the Bhakti poetry, for example, in 
addition to those already noted above, the itinerary poet in both Sangam and Bhakti 
periods; a gradually sectarian god replacing the king of the Sangam poetry, among 
others.62 It is in this changed landscape that the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans’ extant historical 
identities seem to begin to shape. One broad division is that of language, dividing the 
group into two historical divisions, Tamil-speaking and Malayalam-speaking, but only 
from ca. 9th century CE, reaching its final shape by the 11th century CE. As noted, 
intercourse existed between the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās and the Tamil Pūrvaśikhās well 
into 8th century CE, but by the middle ages of Tamil history, the different segments had 
begun to acquire their historical characteristics, defining broadly four extant groups: the 
Malayalam-speaking Nambudiri Brahmans; the Tamil-speaking Śōḻiya Brahmans (with 
many sub-divisions); the Dīkṣitar Brahmans of the Chidambaram Śiva temple; and the 
Mukkāṇi Brahmans of the Tiruchendur Murukan temple. 

In my scheme, the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās move to Kerala, to its Malabar region, 
through the Palghat gaps, their arrival creating a śrauta realm along both sides of the 
Bhāratap-puḻa river (Map II).63 The Tamil Pūrvaśikhās, still, it would seem, in the 
Kaḷabhra realm, fragment through most of the Kaveri area of the Cōḷa realm and the south 
east in the Pānṭiyan kingdom, each group carrying with it a common sthalapurāṇa of 
their new homes, the most well-known of which is to be found among the Pūrvaśikhā 
Dīkṣitars of the Chidambaram temple: a given number of families, 3000 in the case of the 
Dīkṣitars of Chidambaram (3700 among the Śōḻiya-Śrīvaiṣṇava Brahmans of Tiruveḷḷarai; 
2000 among the Mukkāṇi Brahmans of Tiruchendur, 300 among both the Śōḻiya- 
Śrīvaiṣṇava Brahmans of Tintiruepparai on the Tāṃṛavaṛṇī and Śōḻiya Śaiva Brahmans of 
Avaṭaiyar Koil on the coast in the north in the Tanjavur District) arrive at their new 
homes and find one family missing; the deity of the temple in the new home—Śiva in 
Chidambaram or in Avaṭaiyār Koil, Viṣnu-Perumāḷ in Tiruveḷḷarai on the Kaveri or 
Tintirurupperai on the Tāmravarṇī, or Murukan-Subrahmaniam at Tiruchendur--taking 
his place. It is seen that this particular narrative occurs only among the Tamil Pūrvaśikhā 
groups, suggesting a common origin. It should be further noted that all three principal 
gods of the Tamil country appear in the trope.64 

## B. iv. The Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās and *Pūrvaśikhā Text in Emerging Kerala 
A central point of my argument is that a *Pūrvaśikhā text leaves the Tamil 
country with the Pūrvaśikha Brahmans, the later historical Nambudiri Brahmans, by now 
almost certainly in the palm leaf manuscripts and, most likely, already in Grantha script 
or an early related Southern Brāhmī script, an important point to which I will come back 
in Section D below. When this manuscript arrived in Poona for collation purposes 
toward the preparation of the CE, it was found to be the shortest SR text, besides being 
the “best,” a universal editorial comment,65 pointing to the high order of its native 
scholarly ecology in terms of the manuscripts and transmission over time. They were in 
palm leaf manuscripts, many bearing the colophon datings of the 19th century and the 
script in which it was transcribed was the Ārya-eḻuttu, a script that Mahadevan see as 
originating from adaptation between the Grantha script and the Vaṭṭeḻuttu scripts (see 
below for a full discussion of this.) The earliest manuscript dates from the fist half of the 
18th century, and as far as can be ascertained, the longevity of the palm leaf manuscript in 
the tropical weather of Kerala is somewhere between 200 to 300 years, giving us three 
cycles of re-copying from their probable date of coming to Kerala. 

We do not know if the text developed during this phase.66 The traditional 
Nambudiri lore lays great stress on the śrauta tradition: dating from about precisely this 
period, how ca. 400 CE, it received a new orientation from Mēḻattōḷ of 99 Agniṣṭomas, a 
figure of the first importance in this tradition-bound community, only Indra’s intervention 
deterring him from the 100th—in a sort of variation of the play of numbers in general of 
the Pūrvaśikhā sthalapurāṇas, noted above.67 The entire extant Nambudiri śrauta 
tradition derives from this figure such that the eight families or gṛhaṃs which took part 
with Mēḻattōḷ in the original marathon series of Somayāgas form the traditional elite of 
the community, the well-known āḍhyān group of eight families, and the root sites of 
these families cluster on the Bhāratap-Puḻa banks on both banks, west of the Palghat gaps, 
comprising the current districts of Malappuram to the north of the river, Palghat directly 
to its west and Trichur south-southwest (Map III).68 The six temples to which all families 
with the traditional śrauta rights also cluster in the same area.69 

The epic seems to have had a different history, a line of development we will see 
in the Tamil country as well: it becomes widely disseminated into the Kerala society at 
large, supplying first a fundamental set of scenes of the kūṭiyāṭṭaṃ and later the kathakaḷi 
dance repertoire, passing thus from the hands of the Brahmans per se, as the performing 40 
and singing personnel of the dance drama were traditionally non-Brahmans. It is likely 
that the manuscripts themselves of the different parvans lay dormant during the process, 
the epic leaching out to a wider public in songs—in striking contrast with the strictly 
regulated śrauta tradition, with only families with the traditional right, deriving from the 
99 Mēḻattōḷ agniṣṭomas, to perform the śrauta ritual undertaking it, even today. Thus it is 
that that the first re-telling of the Mahābhārata in Malayalam comes from Tuñjettu 
Eḻuttacthan, a member of the Nair community, ca. 16th century CE, in the kiḷippāṭṭu mode, 
one tenth in extent of the entire epic. It is of equal interest that a complete verse-to-verse 
translation of the epic appears also in non-Brahman circles, not Nair but princely families 
with links to the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās through the saṃbandham alliance system, in 
Kuññukkuṭṭi Tampuran’s 125,000-verse (inclusive of the Harivaṃśa) translation of the 
epic, reliably recorded to have been accomplished in an astonishing 874 days, (1904- 
1907), with the Harivaṃśam taking another 3 1⁄2 months.70 

## B. v. The Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās, the *Pūrvaśikhā text, and the Āḻvār Vaiṣṇavism 
It is of the utmost importance to note that a *Pūrvaśikhā text remains behind in 
the Tamil country, my Σ-text, in the hands of the future Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās. It stands to 
reason that it would; it is unlikely that all traces of the epic would have left for the 
Malabar country with the future Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās at the Kaḷabhra Interregnum. It 
is also the concrete evidence that the *Pūrvaśikhā version had risen in the Sangam 
country before the Kaḷabhra Interregnum as a text of the entire Pūrvaśikhā group: we see 
the texts in the hands of its two branches, otherwise already linked by the pūrvaśikhā tuft 
and rare Vedic śākhās. And the Σ-SR text produces even more far-reaching aftermaths 
than the *Pūrvaśikhā that moved to the Malabar country with the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās: 
it functions as the nursery of the Śrīvaiṣṇava-Bhakti movement in the peninsular region. 
It also hosts the Sukthankar σ-text, a theoretical entity conceived by him to fit the 
patterns of textual histories and developments revealed by the manuscripts. 
First, the Σ-text provides the basis for the Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa-Kṛṣṇa content of the 
Āḻvār-Vaiṣṇavism, especially its khilā parvan, the Harivaṃśa. As we have already noted, 
the Harivamśa of the Mahabhārata was the principal conduit of the Viṣṇu-Kṛṣṇa content 
to the merging Āḻvār-discourse of the Śrīvaiṣnavism: All the four Brahman Āḻvārs (three 
male and the fourth the foundling daughter of one of them) were Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās, 
presumably thus with Σ-text of the SR. It is their songs, and those of other seven non- 
Brahman Āḻvārs, that are collected as the Nālāyiradivyaprabhandam (The Four Thousand 
Sacred Utterances; NDP), establishing the Kṛṣṇa-Viṣṇu of the Mahābhārata (and Rāma 
of the sister epic Rāmāyaṇa) as the central figure in the emerging Śrīvaiṣṇava Bhakti 
movement, in the post-Kaḷabhra period, 6th-9th centuries CE. We must note here, and I 
will come back to it, that the source for the Āḻvār Vaiṣṇavism is solely and entirely the 
epic (Hardy 1983), the Vaiṣṇava literature of the north (2nd century CE), the Viṣṇu and 
Brahmapurāṇas in particular, playing no part in its formation.71 As in Kerala above, in 
Section A. iii, the epic seems to spread beyond the Brahmans in the Tamil country as 
well, in that the other seven Āḻvārs are from non-Brahman social groups, Nammāḻvār- 
Śaṭagōpan in particular, eventually to become the most iconic of all Āḻvārs. Also, as in 
Kerala, the epic comes to structure the important non-Brahman repertory of the kūtthu 
rituals of the non-Brahman social groups of the Tamil country. I will come back to both 
these problems below. 

And second, the Σ-text functions as the host Mahābhārata to the in-coming 
Aparaśikhā Brahmans and their σ text. As noted earlier, we do not know if this group, 
beginning to be attested in significant numbers in the Tamil country proper well after the 
Kaḷabhra Interregnum, brought with them the epic, although the conclusion, based on 
their distinguished Vedic credentials (see below), that that they did so is irresistible. And 
if they did, considering that their original homes lay in the Mathurā region on the 
Yamunā in a time period starting with 5th to several centuries afterwards, it was a 
Northern Recension text, possibly part of the Vulgate (K) group, as is indeed shown by 
the Sukthankar phantom σ-text. Yet the Tamil and Telugu versions of the Mahābhārata 
that went to Poona, mostly from Tanjore’s Sarasvatī Mahāl library, subsequently, an 
Aparaśikhā center of learning, (first created in the 1600’s CE under Tanjore Nayakas as 
Sarasvatī Bhaṇḍār, re-established in 1820 in its present name by King Serfoji II of the 
Mahratta rule of Tanjavur; see below), are all in the mould of the SR. 
It was in order to solve this difficulty that Sukthankar created the σ-text. He is 
not linking it to Brahman migrations; he sees that the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu 
manuscripts of the epic are all in the mould of the Southern Recension, vastly inflated in 
comparison to the Malayalam version of the epic, but familially also of the SR. 
Moreover, he finds this extra epic material to align itself regularly with the Northern 
Recension: so a NR must be present in the scene, the basis for his σ-text—the text we see 
coming in the scheme I am suggesting, with the Aparaśikhā Brahmans. As I noted above, 
that Sukthankar’s hypothetical σ-text finds a logical niche in the scheme proposed here of 
the migration of epics and Brahmans may well be the most probative link in its 
reasoning--Sukthankar’s hypothesis validated by concrete evidence from the Brahman 
migration of my scheme. 

What is of interest, on the other hand, is that the SR text of the Śōḻiya 
Pūrvaśikhās, our Σ-text, holds the stage in facing the σ-text of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans. 
The Aparaśikhā Brahmans, arriving in the Tamil country at the Pallava-Cōḷa patronage 
for more than half a millennium, become in time the dominant Brahman group of the 
Tamil country, outnumbering the Tamil Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans almost 25 to 1 by modern 
times and transforming them in the process into a minority in their own homes, and at 
that a thoroughly “interpellated” group.72 Yet the resident Southern Recension text, the 
Σ-text of the Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās, holds the stage for the day. I will note that this is in 
keeping with another major product of interaction between the two Brahman groups, the 
complex tradition of the mature, historical Śrīvaiṣṇavism. 

We know from their Veda śākhās (see below) that the Aparaśikhā Brahmans 
originate in the Mathurā region on the Yamuna River, already a major area of the Kṛṣṇa 
cult at their departure ca. 5th century CE and later. There can be little doubt that the early 
Vaiṣṇava literature (Viṣnu- and Padma-Purāṇas) was known to them, if they were not its 
creators in the first place. Yet we see that they re-orient their native Vaiṣṇavism to the 
Āḻvār texts, the resident host Vaiṣṇava tradition of the Tamil country, eventually 
producing with Nāthamuni and later with Rāmānuja, the orthodoxy and orthopraxy of the 
historical Śrīvaiṣnavism. As Dihejia (1990) shows, the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, ca. 9th 
century CE, clearly showing the influence of Āḻvār Vaiṣṇavism, is the outward 
manifestation of this synthesis, in some ways a counterpart in the Bhakti world to the 
Tamil (Grantha) and Telugu versions of the Mahābhārata in the epic world. I will come 
back to this problem in detail below. 

It must be added here as a general point that the precise knowledge of the origin 
and development of Śrīvaiṣṇavism in South India is far from adequate and still clouded 
by zealous hagiography and sectarian ethos. We find that as late as S. Krishnaswamy 
Aiyangar’s Early Vaiṣṇavism (1914), Rāmānuja is thought to have preceded the Āḻvārs in 
the traditional Aparaśikhā historiography. Aiyangar is establishing what we know to be 
the broad historical sequence that characterizes the development of Śrīvaiṣṇavism in the 
Tamil country: first the Āḻvārs, fixed at a number, twelve in Rangachari ([1931]1986: 9), 
then the open-ended sequence of Ācāryas beginning with Nāthamuni, as we will see, an 
Aparaśikhā Brahman. We must note that the founding Āḻvār stratum of Śrīvaiṣṇavism 
entirely pre-dated the Aparaśikhā Brahman arrival, and it comprised several non- 
Brahman figures, not found to be the case with the Ācārya phase, which is an all- 
Brahman list. This is the reason why the entire Brahman content of Āḻvār Vaiṣṇavism is 
found to be made up of the Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās; the Aparaśikhā numbers swell through 
the 108-grāmadeya system only by the latter half of the Pallava reign, indeed supplying 
Nāthamuni the first figure in the Ācārya sequence and an Aparaśikhā Brahman, who 
creates the NDP from the Āḻvār compositions with the assistance of Maturakavi, a Śōḻiya 
Pūrvaśikhā. An interesting incident in the life of this figure gives us a picture of the 
social dynamics between the resident Pūrvaśikhās and the immigrant Aparaśikhās, 
resulting in what I have characterized above as the interpellated status (see note 50 
above) of the Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās. Nāthamuni, already seen to be associated with the 
Pūrvaśikhā Maturakavi, sends his disciple Uyyakkondar, also a Pūrvaśikhā Brahman and 
second to Nāthamuni in the later Ācārya sequence, as his wife’s escort to one of the area 
Pallava era land-grant Aparaśikhā settlements, where he is fed stale food outside the host- 
Aparaśikhā home because of his pūrvaśikhā, the outwardly, visible and experience-near 
marker (an incident strikingly recalling the more famous later one, in Ramanuja’s life, 
[see below] involving a similar conduct by his wife toward Ramanuja’s guru, Periya 
Nambi). The principals in both incidents, Nāthamuni and Rāmānuja, behave with noble 
revulsion toward the interpellation, Rāmānuja renouncing family life and wife and 
Nāthamuni extolling his disciple with the name Uyyakkondar [“you elevated me”], the 
name by which he is known in subsequent tradition.73 Indeed, so much so, it is hardly 
known in the Śrīvaiṣṇava community, as I found in my fieldwork, that all four Brahman 
Āḻvārs were Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans,74 even though as noted already and as we will see in 
detail in Section C, this scenario is verified by the epigraphy of the Aparaśikhā Brahman 
migration and the textual history of the SR Mahābhārata beyond all uncertainty. 
All of this throws, it must be added, interesting light on the acculturated state of 
the relationship between the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans and the indigenous non-Brahman 
groups: together they create (as is the case with the Nāyanmār-Śaivism as well) the Āḻvār 
Vaiṣṇavism. And we may ask what were the sources for the Kṛṣṇa myths—the three 
Viṣṇu steps, the various avatāras, that of dwarf Vāmana especially; the Govardhana 
mountain and above all, what Ramanujan (1981: 150-152) calls the “mutual cannibalism” 
of Kṛṣṇa and his devotee--in the poetry of Nammāḻvār, a non-Brahman Āḻvār and 
eventually the most iconic of all Āḻvārs? It will be recalled that Friedhelm Hardy (1983: 
413 and see note 49 above) poses this question with respect to the Brahman Āḻvār, 
Periyāḻvār (Viṣṇucitta), answering that the source could only have been the Mahābhārata, 
Harivaṃśa in particular (the Σ-SR text in my scheme) and not the early Purāṇas—a 
conclusion broadly applicable to Nammāḻvār as well as other non-Brahman Āḻvārs. Hardy 
takes Periyāḻvār’s Sanskrit learning for granted: can we do so for the non-Brahman Āḻvārs 
as well? Perhaps not, but it is clear that the epic is no longer confined to its Sanskrit 
traditions. As we know, a Tamil translation already existed in the Sangam period, and as 
in Kerala, the material from epic begins to enter broadly into the social life of non- 
Brahman groups, in the kūthu repertory. As additional evidence of this, Hiltebeitel 
(1988; 1991a) has shown that the Draupadī cult is deeply entrenched through the length 
and breadth of the Tamil country. 

## B. vi. The *Pūrvaśikhā text and the Poona Critical Edition 
Altogether 11 centers sent *Pūrvasikhā Mahābhārata to the Bhandarkar Oriental 
Research Institute at Poona from inside Kerala, 5 of them private Nambudiri homes 
(mana), others chiefly princely families and palace libraries, all, however, with close 
connections to the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās through the saṃbandam alliance system.75 
The colophon dates appear only occasionally, generally in the 19th century. No single 
center sent an entire corpus, Cochin State Library sending a maximum of 15 (Ādi, Sabhā, 
Virāta, Udyoga, Drona, Śalya, Sauptika, Strī, Anuśāsana, Śānti [minus the 
Mokṣadharma], Aśvamedhika, Mausala, Mahāprasthānika, Svargārohaṇa) and four 
sending only one parvan. However, all 24 parvans of the *Purvaśikhā text existed in 
Kerala. Moreover, if a particular house or center did not send a parvan to Poona, it did 
not mean that the parvan did not exist in that house or center. Thus for example in 2005 
when I visited the Poomulli Mana, which sent the largest number of parvans (12) from 
among the Nambudiri homes to Poona, I saw the Bhīṣmaparvan in the mana’s very 
dilapidated library in regrettable contrast to its traditional repute for care and up-keeping 
of records. But it was not one of the 12 parvans that went to Poona from this center. 
The literary or scholarly ecology which kept these manuscripts in transmission 
shows itself to have been highly viable. We have the best data available for the 
Ādiparvan: 26 Malayalam manuscripts of the parvan went to Poona for the collation of 
the CE, of which 8 made the critical apparatus.76 All the above manuscripts that went to 
Poona were in palm leaf, written in Malayalam script, in the Āryeḻuttu script that the 
Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās developed in the Malabar province of the present-day Kerala 
state between the Grantha and Vaṭṭeḻuttu during the 13th century CE (I. Mahadevan 2003: 
212). We will see in Section C below that what may be thought of as the ‘scripta franca’ 
of the entire region of the Kerala—along with the eastern coast of the Tamil country, the 
Pāṇṭiyan kingdom—was at this time the Vaṭṭeḻuttu form of the Tamil Brāhmī script, a 
script that cannot meet the entire range of Sanskrit phonology, thus ruling itself out, I will 
note, as the script in which the SR was created in the same linguistic area. We will 
further see, from I. Mahadevan (2003) on the scripts of South India, that the only script 
that offers itself for the composition of the Sangam era SR *Pūrvaśikhā text was the 
Grantha script, or an earlier form of it, derived from the Southern Brāhmī script. 
Mahadevan notes without explanation that the Nambudiris developed the Āryeḻuttu script 
from the Grantha and the Vaṭṭeḻuttu scripts, around 13th century CE. In fact, in the 
linguistic map of Kerala, the traditional Āryeḻuttu region forms something of a wake in 
the Palghat area, largely overlapping the area of the Nambudiri settlements on the 
Bhāratap-puḻa, the Vaṭṭeḻuttu script spreading to the south from the Bhāratap-puḻā and 
Kōleḻuttu, a form of Vaṭṭeḻuttu, to the north (Map IV). It is further seen that the area of 
the Āryeḻuttu script and Śrauta praxis of the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās coincide, suggesting 
that this script is the product of interaction in situ between the Grantha script that traveled with them to the Malabar region and the local Vaṭṭeḻuttu. 

Our best estimate for the longevity of the palm leaf manuscript is 300 years, plus 
or minus 100 years: thus, the *Pūrvaśikhā text must have gone through two cycles of 
copying after its creation. We know that there developed in Malabar a social caste of 
scribes, used by Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās to write down non-Vedic texts, the Sanskrit epics 
falling in this category.77 * * * * * * *
