Tonight marks the most important Shaivite holy-‚Äúday‚Äù of the year. Maha
ShivRatri ‚Äì the ‚ÄúGreat Night of Shiva‚Äù.

Various sources give slightly differing accounts as to the mythic
significance and origins of the Night‚Äôs place in our religion; with two
of the more prominent being that it commemorates the reunification of
Lord Shiva and Lady Parvati \[depicted above\] in marriage following the
latter‚Äôs reincarnation after the events of the Daksha Yajna Nasha, or
that it marks the occasion each year when Lord Shiva Nataraja performs
the Tandava ‚Äì a cosmic dance whose rhythms and motions are keyed to
those of the universe itself \[seen below\].

The forms of observance we carry out on this night will vary from region
to region, sect to sect, and the individual preferences of the Devotee.
In many places, it is customary for the more ardent to carry out a
Jagraan ‚Äì an all-night vigil, replete with the singing of hymns,
chanting, regaling of Shaivite legends, and frequent offerings of Milk
on the Lingam. I was fortunate \[bilingual pun there\] enough to be able
to participate in just such a Devotion last year at my local Mandir
\[finally leaving a little after six in the morning at the end of
proceedings with sunrise\], although perhaps because it‚Äôs a weeknight,
Mandir‚Äôs shutting at Midnight tonight this year.

It‚Äôs also frequent \[as one would expect\] to see dance being performed,
the mass-carrying out of RudraAbhishekam, and in some places, the rather
substantial consumption of cannabis \[Shiva being a renowned connoisseur
of the drug; and Shaivite Sadhus also making frequent use of it in the
course of their activities\].

In places \[chiefly the northern regions\] wherein the marriage of Shiva
and Parvati is held to be the inspiration for the night, you might also
see a Marriage Procession being carried out for Mahadev known as a
‚ÄúBhole Ki Baraat‚Äù. This builds from the traditional element of a Hindu
marriage ritual wherein a Dulha \[‚ÄòGroom‚Äô\] will ride as part of an
armed procession \[Baraat\] to the residence of his prospective Dulhan
\[‚ÄòBride‚Äô\], which is referenced in the mythology of both Shiva and
Durga in the instance wherein Lord Shiva turns up at the gates of the
palace of King Himavat \[the Lord of the Himalayas\] accompanied by His
(Bhuta)Gana ‚Äì the Retinue of Lord Shiva comprised of all manner of
ghosts, fiends, and wild-looking Shaivite Holy-Men \[compare the
Einherjar of Odin\] ‚Äì with a view to marrying Parvati, causing quite the
terror and consternation in His prospective father-in-law due to .. well
.. an army of undead and demonic-looking aspect turning up on your front
door-step. The terror, of course, being dispelled when Mata JI assumes
the ChandraGhanta Aspect of Durga and helps Her father to see Mahadev as
He is in His Grandeur, thus allowing the Marriage to successfully
proceed![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/f51/1/16/1f603.png)üòÄ

Of course, Nepal being Nepal ‚Ä¶ they arguably go a bit higher than the
lower-key \[relatively speaking\] processions of Shaivites who may or
may not be dressed as the aforementioned Army of the Undead ‚Ä¶ by having
the actual Nepali Army \[whose official ensign features the Trishula and
Damaru of Mahadev\] performing a parade in His honour; alongside the
arrival of \*literally hundreds of thousands of Hindus\* at the
Pashupatinath \[‚ÄòLord of Beasts‚Äô\] Temple-Complex in Kathmandu.

Among their number will be thousands upon thousands of Shaivite
holy-men, many bearing tridents, drums, and wild hair in imitation and
resonistic synchronicity with Our Lord. A fair number of them will also
be walking amidst billowing smoke from both cannabis and fire-offerings
\[and it amuses me every year when the Nepali police issue a statement
in the run-up to Maha ShivRatri stating they won‚Äôt be enforcing the
country‚Äôs American-imposed anti-drug laws against the Shaivite Saints
and Sadhus in attendance ‚Äì nobody, one supposes, wants to arrest a
holy-man\]; which further recalls a number of the epithets and
adjectives by which we understand Lord Shiva.

All in all, an amazingly impressive sight ‚Äì and one that, one day, I
hope to be present for.

But for Tonight .. we‚Äôll be down at Bharatiya Mandir from this afternoon
through the evening until Midnight, and then head home where I‚Äôll
continue my devotional activities \[as I do many nights, as it happens\]
through to the morning.

Although perhaps not with the dancing \[and definitely not the
cannabis-smoking\] that a much younger me would have previously been
engaged in for the occasion.
