The duel drew out with the adversaries for a while. It was slow moving
with neither side being able to cut lose or declare victory. yakShiNI-s
and kR^ityA-s flew by. We gathered our armor but knew that the rAkShasI
could come after we feel asleep and would try to break our armor. We
decided to try to intercept that duly. Tomorrow we would know how the
struggle will play out.
