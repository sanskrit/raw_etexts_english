## THE CUP

This is your cup — the cup assigned  
            to you from the beginning.  
Nay, My child, I know how much  
            of that dark drink is your own brew  
Of fault and passion, ages long ago,  
In the deep years of yesterday, I know.

This is your road — a painful road and drear.  
I made the stones that never give you rest.  
I set your friend in pleasant ways and clear,  
And he shall come like you, unto My breast.  
But you, My child, must travel here.

This is your task. It has no joy nor grace,  
But it is not meant for any other hand,  
And in My universe hath measured place,  
Take it. I do not bid you understand.  
I bid you close your eyes to see My face.
