Burnell,in one of his appendices to his monograph on the
aindra-vyAkAraNa noted a conlang of sorts,which went by the name of
bhANDIrabhASA. This conlang prakRt has a grammar on it authored by a
certain kRSNa-kavI,and was used to compose songs in plays by a certain
veGkatamakhIn,though the only example I heard of was taken from saGgIta
sampradAya pradarzini of subbarAma dIkSita(1904).

The origin mythos of this conlang is thus given

Of this,nArada was ordered by gopinAtha(kRSNa) to compose a
grammar,which he did,and subsequently taught to the sage zArdula.

It’s character and purpose was listed thus:

ghoSAkSarair yuktam api mRdu zrAvyaM manoharam\|  
prakAzArthaM gItayogaM bhANDIram iti kathyate\|\|

It was indended mainly to suit certain musical purposes.Naresh Keerthi
noted that a musical language like this would have been uniformly
unintelligible to the different people who inhabited tanjAvUr at the
time of its composition,so it would not privilege any particular
community in the audience.

It’s grammar has a series of modified zivasutras reproduced below

\| a,i,u,n \| R,lR,k \| e,o,G \| ai,au,c \| h,y,s,r,l,G \| J,m,G,N,n,m
\| jh,bh,gh,Dh,dh,j,b,g,D,d \| c,ph,ch,Th,th,p,c,c,T,t,y \| z,S,s,t \|

An example of how words seemed to be formed

|                |                 |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **bhANDIra**   | **Sanskrit**    |
| aikhun aikhuni | AkarNyA’karNya  |
| kRSNuv’Ananddu | kRSNasyA’nandaH |
| teNe ujali     | teno’jjvalitam  |
| aritu          | haritaH         |
| aruhu          | arhaH           |
| cekkam         | cakram          |
| haricandaru    | harizcandraH    |
| bhuMmi         | bhUmiH          |

It has an elaborate system of inflection for both nouns and verbs. An
example given by Burnell:

Singular Present tense: bhU(root): bhomi,bhosi,bhodi/bhoti  
Plural Present tense:bhoma,bhodha,bhonti

After giving the pANinian technical terms the writer(presumably
kRSNa-kavI) ends with: teSAM rupaM saMskRtavat sarvaM tadbhavasaMmatAt“.

Burnell opines: “It is thus evident that this bhAndIrabhASA is merely a
variety of prakRt,but which violates the phonetic rule of the last by
which kh,gh,th,dh,bh usually become h”.
