title = "Encounter continues"

As we have a long day ahead of us tommorow we shall be curt. We did
surprisingly well on front \#3 and we hope the gods favor us again in a
similar encounter tommorow. We also obtained some clue regarding our
ranking in the midst of the warring states. We believe we were evenly
matched with our adversary. But as every one knows battles can be lost
on small points. Certain unusual delays that our rivals were subject to
favored us on the front. More mysteriously the same omen continues
unabated, but we are not bothering to check it means good or bad
according to the shakuna shAstra.
