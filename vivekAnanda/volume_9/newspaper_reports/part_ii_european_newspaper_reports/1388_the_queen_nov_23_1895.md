## AN UNIVERSAL RELIGION

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 3, pp. 276-77.)

\[*The Queen, The Lady's Newspaper*, November 23, 1895\]

Mrs. Haweis's first autumn At home took place last Saturday at Queen's
House, when the Indian Yogi, or ascetic, Swami Vive Kananda (Buddhist
\[*sic*\] delegate at the Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893)
discussed in a liberal spirit, and not without humour, the chances and
the charms of an universal religion.[1](#fn1) He showed that the
underlying principles of all the great religions of the world resembled
one another, and amongst the great prophets he placed the Christian
Redeemer very high, implying, however, that His teaching was little
borne out sometimes by His professed followers. There was no radical
impossibility of reconciliation between sects, now biting and devouring
each other from the best motives, if charity and sympathy were carried
into the kiosque, the temple, and the church. Canon Basil Wilberforce
and the Rev. H. R. Haweis both made interesting speeches in reply to the
Swami. . . . The guests numbered 150.
