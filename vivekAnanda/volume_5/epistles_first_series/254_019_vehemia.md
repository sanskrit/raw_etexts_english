WASHINGTON,  
*23rd October, 1894*.

DEAR VEHEMIA CHAND LIMBDI,

I am going on very well in this country. By this time I have become one
of their own teachers. They all like me and my teachings.... I travel
all over the country from one place to another, as was my habit in
India, preaching and teaching. Thousands and thousands have listened to
me and taken my ideas in a very kindly spirit. It is the most expensive
country, but the Lord provides for me everywhere I go.

With my love to you and all my friends there (Limbdi, Rajputana).

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.
