Ths is a novice’s attempt to answer about why the practice of some
deities:tArA,chinnamastA(to a small extent vajrayoginI too),vilAsinI
also is soiterologically relevant:

An example of animus Buddhists displayed to Hindu systems can be seen
about. This ritual consumption of brahmin flesh(a huge NO in any Hindu
system that will ever exist) stems from two sources:(1)A kApAlika
background is suggestible,as noted by t[he offering of
brahmapuShpa](https://www.kamakotimandali.com/advaita/kumarila.html) to
gain power as recorded by the author(I am not saying that that system
existed in toto like that at Adi Shankara’s time but it transmits some
relevant information about a cult with similar practices) and (2)actual
dvesha for brAhmaNas,the gurus and systemizers of a lot of the native
systems in the first place from where they took our mantras from:Hence
these deities under the influence of the Bauddha transmitters took on
Bauddha dresses in various aspects(like Rishi,etc)  
  
With deities worshipped by such people,how is it that our people gain
mukti?[Taking leads from this
article](http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=861&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1)
suggested by the author of the Kamakotimandali blog suggests that
without a proper understanding of the tattvic scheme,such Bauddha
upAsakas in the 36 tattva scheme would attain at best Buddhi
tattva,mahAdevIing the chintAmaNI she is, granting the sAdhakas
according to their view. Or worse,worldly siddhi mainly only more often.

Another thing is that in Hindu views,the deity with the same iconography
is interpreted differently. An example is here where the image which is
considered that of Arya achala is interpreted as that of k[rodharAja
rudra trampling some demonic
yakSha](https://www.facebook.com/Chinnamastasaranam/posts/2627598860815914).
Sometimes the descriptions in the Astika version are superficially
different(sarvasiddhi and sarvabuddhi rather than sarvabuddhaDAkinI).  
  
So the transmissions which have come back to Hindus with that Buddhist
dress have in key,a different understanding than the Buddhists of what
they are worshipping+when they got back the tranmissions from those who
achieved only siddhi,their correct understanding put them on higher
states of AdhyAtma than the Bauddhas they got it from.(albeit coloured
by the ‘shunya’ type of language they inherited)\[because they could
understand the tattvas better and the devI granted them a place in those
higher tattvas\]. Another core difference is a practical respect in
terms of ritual to brahmins(in the bhojana anga of the Hindu method of
attaining siddhi in mantras).  
  
Addendum by @TheRajarshi:  
  
1. The necromancy practices are still prevalent even among H Kapalika-s
(few are there still) but neither done in public nor publicized.  
2. The actual consumption is mostly a tokenism in ritual setting to gain
powers. 3. The mention of “brahmin” is because brahmins were the ones
who had the tapa-shakti, other Vs did not. Same way even today in H
viracara when taking a kapalapatra one cannot take random one…. else
there is no Shakti in it, and becomes useless. Specific type of kapalas
are useful. Guru decides basd on nature of sadhaka/na. Same logic
baudhas were using. A kapala of a an individual who was a good
yogi/sadhaka is highly prized. Or a chandala for certain rituals.  
3.The icons of baudha deities trampling on H (IMO) was result of
assimilation + abhicara practices which each group was doing on the
other. But by time of Kalacakra tantra the Baudhas had come full circle
and accepted H deities without any modification/distortion –
post-Islam.  
4. Coming to practical upasana Vajrayanists also produced terrific
siddhas (not lower level at all if one knows how to judge the level of a
siddhi) as did Hindus.
