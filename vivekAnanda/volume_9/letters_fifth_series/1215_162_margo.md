## CLXII

*To Sister Nivedita*

LOS ANGELES  
\[*Early February 1900*\]

DEAR MARGO \[MARGOT\],

You have the Gopâla.[1](#fn1) Add the Sâvitri story[2](#fn2) to that. I
send you four more herewith. They ought to make a nice volume. Work on
them a bit, will you. If you get a publisher in Chicago, all right; if
not, Mr. Leggett promised to publish them sometime ago.

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. The preliminary parts should be struck off.
